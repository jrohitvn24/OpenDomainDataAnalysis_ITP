		<title>09AN INTERVIEW WITH A FARMER</title>
		<content> Mr.Winford Phillips lives on a farm   
 which is situated on the site of an   
 old fort.He has resided in the        
 locality since birth and purchased his
 present farm in 1939.It is called     
 GRONLLWYN and he believes that the    
 name derives from "the circle         
 surrounded by trees".It is preserved  
 as an ancient monument.               
 It is a comparatively small farm of   
 120 acres with dairy and beef cattle  
 and some sheep. When purchased the    
 quality of the land was poor but it   
 has gradually been improved and       
 cultivated to a much better standard, 
 in earlier days using such laborious  
 methods as travelling with horse and  
 cart to the lime kilns of             
 Haverfordwest &lt;a town 16 miles away>  
 and spreading the lime with hand      
 tools,to the more sophisticated       
 methods of mechanical farming today.  </content>
