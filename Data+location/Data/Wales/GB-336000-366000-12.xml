		<title>12Industry In Blacon</title>
		<content>   Blacon itself is mainly a           
 residential area.The larger industries
 lie on the{Sealand Industrial Estate. 
{Here there}are a variety of           
 warehouses, factories, and other      
 industries.There is a{hypermarket     
{called Kwik Save on}Sealand Road,     
 which includes many other shops. There
 are also{canning}and{bottling         
{factories on Sealand Road}for soft    
 drinks and beers.The Chester          
 Corporation has a{sewage works}between
 the River Dee and the industrial      
 estate and there is also a{gas-works.}
   There is quite a lot of{derelict    
 land. Also there is an MFI warehouse  
 which sells furniture of all kinds,   
 bathroom and bedroom suites can also  
 be bought. Because of the factories   
 and all the smoke coming from them the
 area is very smelly.
