 longest living of all plants.A tree is
 a perrenial woody plant.Most of the

{Wern Wood,}map reference{325/056.}    
 There were 3 trees not found in this  
 wood;these were the Yew found in      
 St.Peter's Churchyard, and the Horse  
 Chestnut and the Walnut found in my   
 garden which is close to the wood.
