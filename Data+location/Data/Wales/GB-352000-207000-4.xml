		<content> In{Lower Redbrook villagers}would like
 to have improved T.V. reception, a 30 
 m.p.h.speed limit,better bus services,
 and provision of mains sewerage.      
 Deepest concern is felt about delays  
 in plans for the development and      
 expansion of the village, including   
 provision of a village hall, to ensure
 its continued viability as a community
 with its own school and facilities for
 young people. The building of old     
 people's bungalows/flats would release
 family council houses.                
{Young people}in the area would like   
 their own youth club and organized    
 outings. They are worried about lack  
 of job opportunities in the area in   
 fields other than garage work,shop and
 office work,building and part-time    
 cafe work. They are anxious about     
 preserving this beautiful area and    
 to have a voice in the community.     </content>
