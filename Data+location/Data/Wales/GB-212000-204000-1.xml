		<content> This is a semi-rural tourist area,    
 consisting of a seaside village with  
 good sandy beaches, with a well       
 maintained harbour for pleasure boats 
 and fishing vessels, situated in the  
 South West corner of Dyfed.The        
 surrounding land is mainly managed    
 grassland, some of which is taken over
 for tourism purposes,caravans and     
 tents.The character of the block has  
 changed dramatically in the last fifty
 years from an industrial coal mining  
 village to its present tourism and    
 agriculture base.It also provides     
 dormitory facilities for workers in   
 the adjacent industrial towns,Pembroke
 ,Milford Haven and Carmarthen.Tourist 
 accommodation ranges from tents to the
 three_star hotel.Entertainment for the
 family holiday maker from the bucket  
 and spade to the sophisticated        
 nightclub.                            </content>
