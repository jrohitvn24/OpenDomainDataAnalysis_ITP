  Hayston Mill is on the boundary      
 between Rosemarket and Llanstadwell   
 parishes.Until about 1920 people from 
 Rosemarket took their corn there to be
 ground.                               
  It is now used as the business       
 premises of Pembroke Pools and Hayston
 Mill Woodstoves.These are two         
 companies run by the same man.Most of 
 his summer work is installing and     
 maintaining swimming pools.Most of his
 winter work is installing and         
 maintaining wood_burning stoves.He    
 employs several people on a part_time 
 basis helping with specific jobs.The  
 owner is the only full_time worker.He 
 travels to most parts of Dyfed in his 
 work.
