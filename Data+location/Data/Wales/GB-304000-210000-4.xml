		<title>04LIFE FOR A TYPICAL VILLAGER</title>
		<content> MRS. Davies is a typical villager in  
 Pontsticill,she gets up at about half 
 past six every morning and goes to    
 feed her animals in the garden.She has
 chickens and ducks which provide her  
 with eggs,which are often difficult to
 find as there are laid in a large     
 garden.                               
        About ten years ago the village
 shop and post office closed down and  
 MRS.Davies found it difficult to keep 
 going to Merthyr to do her shopping.In
 addition MRS.Davies is without a car  
 and finds it difficult to relay on    
 public transport which runs to and    
 from Merthyr only every two hours.    
 Often in the winter she has to stock  
 up well with frozen food and sacks of 
 potatoes as she often finds herself   
 cut off.Four years ago MRS. Davies    
 opened up her house as a bed and      
 breakfast establishment.              </content>
