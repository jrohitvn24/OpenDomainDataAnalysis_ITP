		<content> The hill flocks winter there and      
 receive a minimum of supplementary    
 feeding except in particularly severe 
 weather.However the ewe lambs and     
 shearlings are sent to lowland past-  
 ures in West Wales for their first two
 winters in order to provide them with 
 better grazing.  This modern form of  
 transhumance is known as "tacking".   
 Formerly the flocks were driven to    
 the Cardiganshire lowlands, the       
 journey requiring about one week.     
 Later the sheep were moved by train.  
 Today the sheep are transported by    
 road.                                 
 Lambing is late on the hills and the  
 Cnewr hill flocks are lambing between 
 mid-April and mid-May.  On the lower  
 land lambing comes about a month      
 earlier.
