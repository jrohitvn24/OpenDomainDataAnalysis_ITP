		<content> Houses in this area are sparse.Most   
 are farmhouses built in the late 19th 
 and early 20th centuries.There are    
 council houses in Ponthenry.Along the 
 B4317 road older houses predominate,  
 but newer houses have been built in   
 between.In Pontyates Ger-y-coed estate
 was built for managerial staff at     
 Cynheidre Colliery,but now it has been
 taken over for private ownership.     
 The latest development to be completed
 is Llys-y-Dderwen which is a solar    
 powered sheltered housing complex for 
 the elderly in Ponthenry.This         
 comprises 26 separate dwellings       
 connected to a communal day centre.It 
 is patrolled by a warden.This complex 
 was opened on October 16th 1985.
