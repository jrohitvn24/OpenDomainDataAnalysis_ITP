		<title>17My Favourite Clothes</title>
		<content>  My favourite dress is white with blue
 spots. On the sleeves are pretty      
 frills edged in blue cotton. Round the
 waist are two stripes of silk, one    
 blue and one white, tied in a neat    
 bow.                                  
  My favourite jumper is very new and I
 am not allowed to play in it. It has  
 wide light blue and white vertical    
 stripes. The sleeves are very baggy at
 the top and is the latest fashion     
 trend.                                
  My favourite Jeans are old and faded 
 and there are nearly holes where the  
 knees go. I like them because they fit
 snugly.                               
  My favourite socks are white with    
 pink and blue triangles on them. There
 is writing below the blue triangle. It
 says "sport" in blue lettering.
