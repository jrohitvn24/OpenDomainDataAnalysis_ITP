		<title>03BIRD WATCHING,LYDART</title>
		<content> Extensive mixed woodland,steep        
 slopes,rough grazing,arable farmland  
 and gardens make Lydart a good place  
 for bird watching.                    
 Buzzards breed in the woods and are   
 heard calling as they soar above the  
 woods in late autumn and early spring 
 to mark their territory. Curlews and  
 little owls also breed locally.       
 Migrant visitors include the grass-   
 hopper warbler,which sings for one or 
 two days in April - perhaps they also 
 breed here. Winter migrants include   
 large flocks of redwings which roost  
 in the woods and are seen in gardens  
 eating berries.                       
 The most exciting sound of spring and 
 summer evenings is the roading of the 
 woodcock as it circles overhead before
 descending into the woods for the     
 night.                                
                                       </content>
