		<title>06Shelve Pool.</title>
		<content> The pool is a very pleasant spot and a
 great favourite with the locals,      
 possibly because it is so out of the  
 way and not the easiest place to find.
 on the summers day we visited it, we  
 found hundreds of tiny{frogs}and there
 were many{ dragonflies.}The water     
{gives}the appearance of silver        
 possibly because it surrounded by     
 trees oak and willow. On the western  
 shore there grew a large patch of     
{reedmace and bullrushes.}It is        
 obviously not a place frequented by   
 tourists or the casual visitor because
 you cannot get near it by car and it  
 does have{desolate}feel about it with 
 an air of{mystery...}the children were
 very excited by the place.
