		<content>       In our grid area there are two  
 comunities, the small village of {    
{Pontrhydyfen}and the larger community 
 of{Cwmavon.}My name is{Jonathan       
{Britton }and I live in{Pontrhydyfen.  
{      Pontrhydyfen}now has two rugby  
 pitches.During the last two years a   
 new rugby pitch has been laid in {    
{Oakwood,}as the{Ryslyn,}being so near 
 the river, was always water_logged.   
 Pontrhydyfen  has its own{rugby club  
 whose team plays in black and amber   
 colours.They also have{five}mini_rugby
 teams:under 9's, under 10's, under    
 11's, under12's and under 14's.       
      The village has a very good      
{Bowling Club}which at present has two 
 current{Welsh}team players. People    
 wishing to play snooker, pool or even 
 bingo can visit the Blue Scar club.
