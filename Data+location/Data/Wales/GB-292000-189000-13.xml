		<title>13Day In The Life Of Michelle</title>
		<content> 2I usually get up at 7.30 a.m. and put
 my school clothes on. For breakfast i 
 have "Start" then i brush my teeth and
 comb my hair and wash. On the way to  
 school i call for my friend Hayley. We
 play when we get to school until the  
 bell goes at 9.00 a.m. We do maths and
 language work most mornings. We have  
 playtime from 10.35 a.m. till 11.50   
 a.m. and before we go out to play we  
 can buy crisps or biscuits. We break  
 for lunch at 12.00 p.m. i have dinner 
 in school. My break ends at 1.10 p.m. 
 then i do singing art and craft, welsh
 or topic work. We have playtime at    
 2.30 p.m. and school ends at 3.40 p.m.
 When i get home i watch television and
 eat my tea.After tea i call for my    
 friends and we sometimes play in the  
 street or play up the mountain. I     
 sometimes have beans and chips for    
 supper and i go to bed at 9.30 p.m.   </content>
