		<content>  At the turn of the century, despite  
 the emergence of{industry}in the area,
 Hope and Caergwrle seemed to be       
 recognised mainly as picturesque and  
 attractive villages.  Their{landscape}
 was captured in many explorers'       
 writings, such as a poem written by   
 Anne Clegg in 1899 simply entitled    
 'Caergwrle'.                          
                                       
 The natural beauty offered by the area
 prompted the emergence of another{    
{industry}-{tourism}- which was not    
 fully exploited until the 1930's.     
 Hope and Caergwrle's popularity,      
 especially with visitors from         
 Merseyside, primarily stemmed from the
 revitalisation of the Caergwrle wells.
