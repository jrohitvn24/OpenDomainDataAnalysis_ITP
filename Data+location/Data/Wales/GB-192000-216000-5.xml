		<title>05Prendergast Superstition</title>
		<content>    Behind Prendergast Church is a     
 winding lane leading to Prendergast   
 Place; from this runs a narrow lane   
 called the{"PIGS' TROUGH"}which was   
 formerly called "Pixies' Trough"......
 ...the story grew up that many people 
 were led over the country_side and    
 then lost by the Pixies...............
 ...the name came from{"PYX"}which is  
 a box which was carried to the Church,
 holding the Holy Bread; a{"TROUGH"}was
 the name for a narrow alley.          
      {!!  THE LOCAL GHOST  !!         
  { * THE WHITE LADY of the GHYLL *    
 ...who is said to float along the foot
 path in Prendergast Place. In a battle
 her husband was killed. She comes back
 each evening, waiting for her husband;
 sometimes she brings a child; at other
 times she just comes alone............
 ...she is very SAD...and in the end...
 !she just{** DISAPPEARS **}in the air!</content>
