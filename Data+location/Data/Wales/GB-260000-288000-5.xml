		<content>{Cantre'r Gwaelod} was supposedly made 
 up of 100 villages surrounded by a    
 very strong wall to keep the sea out. 
 Guards opened and closed the sluice_  
 gates, but one night, two guards drank
 too much and forgot, so that all the  
 villages except Borth were drowned.   
    Wallog Bay,south of Borth has an   
 outcrop of rocks, Sarn Cynfelin,claim_
 ed to be the remains of the destroyed 
 wall.Some claim to have heard tinkling
 bells from the drowned villages.      
{Traeth Maelgwyn }When the ruler of    
 West Wales died, they had a contest to
 choose a successor. Everyone eligible 
 took a chair to the sea's edge and the
 person who sat longest as the tide    
 came in was to be crowned ruler.      
    Maelgwyn was the local chieftain.  
 His servant built a chair covered with
 waxed birds' wings. When everyone else
 fell, Maelgwyn floated, and won.      </content>
