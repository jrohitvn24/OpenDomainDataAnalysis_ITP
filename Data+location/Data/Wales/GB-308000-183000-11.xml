		<title>11FAMILY LIFE - UNEMPLOYED 2</title>
		<content> One of the biggest problems of being  
 unemployed is the time I have on my   
 hands. My wife is also at home in the 
 day and so we tend to get on each     
 others nerves. Because we've got no   
 spare money we can't seem to get away 
 from each other. I try to help around 
 the house but I think she would prefer
 it if I left it to her.               
 Most people are quite understanding   
 about the problems we have but it is  
 hard to get the kids to understand.   
 They see their friends with new       
 clothes and toys or going on holiday  
 and they can't understand why they    
 can't have the same.                  
 I worry about their future. What will 
 it be like when they grow up if it is 
 this bad now? The unemployment problem
 isn't being solved it is just getting 
 worse.                                
                                       </content>
