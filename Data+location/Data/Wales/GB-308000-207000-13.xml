		<title>13ART AND CRAFT IN RHYMNEY</title>
		<content>                                       
   Art and crafts, in the Rhymney area 
 appear to be thriving.With an         
 increasing amount of leisure time     
 available to many and an interest     
 both in the aesthetic and financial   
 aspects,a considerable amount of work 
 of this kind is pursued.              
   There is a thriving Art Society     
 which, in 1985, is exhibiting at the  
 Rhymney Valley Arts Festival in Ystrad
 Mynach.Standards are quite high with  
 one member exhibiting recently at the 
 Royal Acadamy.                        
   Other talents include metal         
 engraving                             
 stained glass window desiging and     
  engraving on slate and glass.On a    
 smaller scale much is being done in   
 the crafts of tapestry collage crochet
 and pressed flower pictures at various
 centres in the town.                  </content>
