		<title>19PUBLIC SERVICES IN GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> Everybody in the area has electricity.
 It comes from the South Wales         
 Electricity Board. There is no mains  
 gas. If you want gas, you must buy it 
 in cylinders, or have it brought by   
 tanker. Half the people have mains    
 water from Dwr Cymry(Welsh Water). The
 rest get their water from springs.    
 Our police force is the Dyfed-Powys   
 Police. They have to come from        
 Knighton. Our firemen are from Powys  
 Fire Service, but usually the Kington 
 firemen from Herefodshire get here    
 first. Ambulances come from Kington or
 Presteigne.For most services we have  
 to go to Kington. The doctors, the    
 hospital, the dentist, and the        
 chemists are all there. If you need an
 operation you have to go to Hereford. 
 For shops, banks, hairdressers, petrol
 we have to go Kington. Newspapers come
 to Gladestry shop or with the postman.</content>
