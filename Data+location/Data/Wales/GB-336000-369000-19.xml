		<content>   Backford School was built for the   
 education of poor people in the       
 1840's. The first teacher was William 
 Gerard in 1844. The present head      
 teacher is Miss Chowen. There are only
 two classes in the main school and a  
 mobile classroom for forty three      
 children. It now has a playground and 
 a playing field.                      
   St. Oswalds's Church in Backford has
 a red stone tower, body and chancel   
 and it was rebuilt in 1728. There is a
 window that was painted for Richard   
 Radclyffe, the Lord of Backford around
 1450.                                 
   Fields in Backford were used for    
 council houses in 1947. Traffic lights
 were erected on the A41 road in 1969, 
 followed by the post box and 'phone   
 box were also added three years later.
 In 1981 the M56 was opened. There are 
 now only 4 working farms in Backford. </content>
