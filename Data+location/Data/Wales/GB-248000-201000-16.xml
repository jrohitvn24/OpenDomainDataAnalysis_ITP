		<title>16Trade Felinfoel Brewery.</title>
		<content> The Brewery started production in     
 1878.The man responsible was the first
 manager, Mr.David John.{ Felinfoel    
{Brewery was the first company in      
{Europe to can beer.}In 1935 a         
 representative from the Metal Box     
 Company arrived at the brewery with   
 this idea. Llanelli,in those days was 
 very much the centre of the tin plate 
 industry. The Brewery chairman was a  
 shareholder and director in one of the
 tin plate mills.He thought the canning
 of beer was a good idea as it would   
 help to stimulate the industry because
 they were in a period of depression in
 the mid-thirties.  Thousands of dozens
 of cans were sent during wartime to   
 the forces.   After the war sales     
 decreased.  But in the last ten years,
 cans,in what's known as the " take    
 home trade"  have grown and grown.
