		<content> There are now facilities within the   
 village for any outdoor organised     
 physical recreation.  The only village
 sporting teams, are Darts teams that  
 meet in the local pub.  Only a small  
 number of the residents travel to     
 either Rhyl or Prestatyn to take      
 advantage of the facilities at the    
 Sports Centres, however, many Enjoy   
 country walks or horse riding at the  
 local farm.  This may be well         
 reflective upon the age of the        
 residents and their country way of    
 life.  In the survey many expressed a 
 desire to see a Bowling Club within   
 the village, with its tranquil ways   
 blending in with the countryside, but 
 no one was prepared to take the       
 initiative to try to find a club for  
 themselves. Some men are members of   
 the Dyserth Bowling Club which plays  
 in the Rhyl and District Leagues.     </content>
