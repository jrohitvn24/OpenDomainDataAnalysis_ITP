		<content> In the centre of the village is the   
{Town Hall}which was presented to the  
 village in 1902 by the{Duke of        
{Beaufort.}The ground floor is an open 
 area.A market used to be held in and  
 around the{Town Hall}and it still has 
 a market stone.There used to be       
 several{Public Houses.The Angel, Duke 
{of York}and{The Greyhound}but only{The
{Angel}remains. Grosmont has houses of 
 all ages. Many houses have been       
 altered and added to over the years,  
 Some were formerly shops,butcheries   
 bakeries or general stores.Recently,  
 if in demand, they might go back into 
 buisness like the{Old Bakery.}We have 
 a small school in Grosmont.It was     
 built in 1877.Lessons were originally 
 taught in the{Old Town Hall.}Following
 the wishes of the {Burgesses }the     
 school was then held in the {New Town 
{Hall }until 1877.                     </content>
