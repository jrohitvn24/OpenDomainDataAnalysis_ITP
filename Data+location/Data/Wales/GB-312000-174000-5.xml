		<title>05ST. DAVID'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Davids Church is 114 years old. It
 was built in 1881. It has a stained   
 glass window showing Jesus blessing   
 his disciples. It shows Ascension day 
 - when Jesus ascended into heaven.    
 This window was put in at Easter 1898 
 by Louis Shirley in memory of his wife
 Jesse Theodora who died when she was  
 only 26 years old. In the church there
 are the names of people living in Ely 
 who died in the First and Second World
 Wars. One man from Ely, Raymond       
 Liversuch died in the Second World    
 Wart when his plane crashed in the sea
 and in the church there is a marble   
 pot memorial to him.
