		<content> Farming is the chief industry found   
 in this block. The ground is mostly   
 low lying and most suitable for dairy 
 and beef farming. Their are about 22  
 farms within the area.                
 In the 3 westerly squares the land is 
 poorly drained and marshy. The old    
 railway line cuts through these.      
 One of the largest farms is Plas      
 Bennett which lies close to Mill Farm.
 Two of the more interesting farm names
 are Pwll y Chwiaid Mawr (Pool of the  
 big ducks).                           
 Each Thursday and Friday many farmers 
 attend the livestock auction at Ruthin
 where they can sell their animals.
