		<content> The main source of employment in the  
 area is the Phurnacite. A new         
 industrial estate has recently        
 developed  on the wide, flat valley   
 floor of the Cynon, called the        
 Aberaman Park Industrial Estate.  The 
 estate is formed of industrial units  
 of varying size, and includes firms   
 making upholstery, replacement        
 windows, etc.  Most of the other      
 industrial Units are located along the
 A4059 and include chicken packaging,  
 soft drink  distributors, car         
 spraying.                             
                                       
      Since the industry of the area   
 is dominated by the Phurnacite, the   
 next page will describe the plant in  
 detail.
