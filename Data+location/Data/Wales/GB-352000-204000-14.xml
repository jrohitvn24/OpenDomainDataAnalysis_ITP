		<content>    Honey is the sweetest, most        
 nutritious natural food, even Stone   
 Age Man used to collect it. Before    
 sugar beet honey was the only         
 sweetener. Beehives were written about
 in the first Domesday Book. Bees are  
 not only useful for honey but also    
 farmers like them because they        
 pollinate their crops.                
    Bees give 3 things:1. honey 2. wax 
 3. propolis.                          
    1. Honey is the food of the bees.  
    2. Wax is made in to combs to store
 the honey in and lay their eggs.It is 
 made in to polish.                    
    3. Propolis is a sticky substance  
 which the bees use to fill holes and  
 gaps in their hive. It is  used in    
 varnish.
