		<title>13ABERDYFI INSHORE RESCUE BOAT</title>
		<content>    The inshore rescue boat stationed  
 in Aberdyfi is an{Atlantic 21 type.   
 This design is particularly suitable  
 for use in dangerous estuary waters.  
    The Dyfi estuary has an ebb tide   
 capable of 7/8 knots.It is guarded by 
 the dangerous Dyfi Bar and contains   
 continually shifting sand banks.      
    The Atlantic 21 is powered by two  
 60 horse power engines capable of 30  
 knots.It has a range of 90 nautical   
 miles.The hull is made of glass       
 reinforced plastic with neoprene      
 tubes and if she should capsize she   
 can be self righted.                  
    The weekly training exercise       
 enables the public to see the boat    
 launched from its trailer and put     
 through its paces by a crew of three. 
    At 1985 prices the Atlantic 21     
 costs approximately Â£29 000.
