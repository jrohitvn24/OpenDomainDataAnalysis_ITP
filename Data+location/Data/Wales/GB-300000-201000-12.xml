  The most popular games for boys are  
 football,rugby,cricket and swimming.  
 For girls they are netball,hockey,    
 rounders and swimming. Apart from     
 these popular games there are also    
 some unusual ones. In one primary     
 school {fireball }is played by the    
 girls.The object of this game is to   
 pass a ball around a circle of        
 children.If the ball is dropped by    
 anyone,that person has to run around  
 the circle before the ball has been   
 passed around it and placed on the    
 spot where the person was previously  
 standing.If the ball gets there first 
 the person has to sit in the middle of
 the ring and suck her thumb.This      
 continues until someone else drops the
 ball.Recently microcomputer games have
 become very popular especially on     
 rainy days.                           </content>
