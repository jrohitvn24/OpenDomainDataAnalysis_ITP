		<content> Employment in the area is generally of
 the agricultural kind. Farmers tend to
 have a great deal of help from their  
 families, wives and children. The     
 children are always particularly keen 
 to help out as a source of extra      
 pocket money. The need for Unions and 
 labour related problems are therefore 
 quite rare.  Apart from farming there 
 is the "Cae Rhys" Riding School, the  
 "Travellers Inn", and a Chicken       
 rearing farm all run by their owners. 
 The rest of the inhabitants are Senior
 Citizens with only two people employed
 outside the area. Unemployment is     
 unknown in the area as yet, and it is 
 hoped will never become an evil in    
 their midst.
