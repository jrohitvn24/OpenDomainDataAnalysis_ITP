		<title>07A day in the Life</title>
		<content> I wake up most mornings with my mother
 at 7.00am.I walk downstairs to turn on
 the telly and the fire.After washing  
 and dressing it's a mad rush to get my
 cup of tea and biscuits down and get  
 ready before 8 o'clock for my mother  
 to go to work.I walk down my Nan's to 
 wait before I go out and talk to my   
 friends.Normally I call for J.J. he   
 tries to do stunts on his bike.Most   
 times I go up into my bedroom and play
 records.We meet friends in the park   
 and play rounders.I have dinner at my 
 Nans,mashed potatoes and sausage.In   
 the afternoon we go up the factories  
 then down the football field.At 6.00pm
 I go in for tea,sandwiches and fruit. 
 Mum says I can stay outside until 8.30
 I don't go very far usually up the    
 park with my friends.After watching TV
 and some supper I talk to Mum about   
 the day.After reading in bed it's zzz.</content>
