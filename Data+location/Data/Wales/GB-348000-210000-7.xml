		<content>   In a survey we found that{shoppers  
 were generally satisfied with the     
 shops in the town.Younger shoppers    
 were more critical and were inclined  
 towards Newport,Cardiff or Gloucester 
 for greater choice.There was an       
 overwhelming demand for a store of the
 Marks and Spencer type.               
   The{produce market}held on Fridays  
 was used mainly by older shoppers for 
 fresh vegetable and dairy products.   
   There is a range of{unusual shops}of
 especial interest to{tourists.}Hand   
 made toys,hand made children's        
 clothes, a bakery, craftsman furniture
 in oak, Italian shoes, delicatessan,  
 imported pastries and a coffee /tea   
 shops.There is also a National Trust  
 shop.
