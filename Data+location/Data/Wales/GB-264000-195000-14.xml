		<content>   Most of the land in our area has    
 been reclaimed. Not so long ago, it   
 was just slag waste from the old works
 but the Council cleared it and for the
 past 15 years trees have been planted 
 regularly. The river, which was once  
 polluted by industrial waste, is now  
 full of trout and mullet. There is a  
 new industrial area in Plasmarl but in
 a smokeless zone so that the land and 
 air will not again suffer pollution.  
                                       
   Future developments include a hotel 
 and leisure park. Already, the Council
 have made a lake called the "Pluck"   
 which has been stocked with fish and  
 there are seats for people to sit on. 
 There are also nature trails through  
 the trees.
