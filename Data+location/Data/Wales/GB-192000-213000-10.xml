		<title>10Haverfordwest New Market</title>
		<content> Haverfordwest Market was opened       
 officially on November 6th 1982 by Mrs
 Cole, Chairman of preseli District    
 Council. It is situated in a new      
 shopping arcade in Bridge Street      
 overlooking the Western Cleddau river.
  Stall Holders rent their stalls from 
 Preseli Council. Some of the stalls   
 are lock-up areas and they cost about 
 Â£50 a week.  Other stalls are set up  
 daily on trestle type tables and cost 
 Â£1.25 daily per six feet space.       
   Completing the market arcade are    
 seven shops overlooking the river.    
 The market traders travell in from as 
 far as Pembroke but most are local    
 people.
