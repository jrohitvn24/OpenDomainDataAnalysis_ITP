		<title>16Farming 9 - Argoed Farm</title>
		<content> The Arggoed consists of the farmhouse 
 and 4 outhouses. The owner and his    
 son, together with one employee farm  
 300 acres. The farm is split into     
 25 fields. It is rented from the      
 Llanarth estate.                      
 Most of the acreage is used for       
 grazing but corn is grown on 60 acres,
 and 12 acres are used for fodder beet.
 The farmer cuts the grass twice a year
 for silage and once for hay. He owns  
 134 cows. 89 of these are dairy cows  
 but 14 are not yielding milk at       
 present. The remainder of the cows    
 consist of 35 heifers and 10 beef     
 cattle. The cows are milked twice a   
 day 6am and 5pm.                      
 Cattle are bought and sold at the     
 Abergavenny and Monmouth markets.     
 Access to either is easy via the A40.
