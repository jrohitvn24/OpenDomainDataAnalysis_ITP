		<title>06THE NEW EXPRESSWAY</title>
		<content> The new expressway,known as the A55   
 was constructed to ease the traffic   
 congestion on the North Wales coast.  
 It is a high speed road,entered by    
 slip roads.It extends from Llanddulas 
 to Llandudno Junction,in all about    
 twelve kilometres.In Llanddulas they  
 have reclaimed land from the sea.In   
 order to do this they put heavy rocks 
 on the embankment followed by twenty- 
 two thousand concrete blocks called   
 dolos.Each block weighs five tonnes.  
 This was done to prevent the sea      
 eroding the embankment and damaging   
 the road.Part of the Chester to       
 Holyhead railway line had to be       
 diverted and approximately one hundred
 and ninety houses had to be demolished
 to make way for the new road.The      
 station forecourt has been            
 reconstructed on an underpass eighty  
 metres long.                          </content>
