 brought to Saundersfoot.Local         
 glassfitters would not tackle the job 
 so experts from Swansea fitted it.The 
 Wesley Chapel anticipates closing down
 in 1989 when the lease expires as it  
 will be too expensive to renew.       
{The Congregational Chapel}in the High 
 St.was built in 1899.There is no      
 resident minister.
