		<content> The land around{Grosmont}is very hilly
 and rises on the{Graig mountain}as    
 high as 352m and is very good for     
 sheep.Nearly all the farms in this    
 area raise sheep.But the number varies
 acording to the size of the farm from 
 about 100 -  650.The breeds include   
{Suffolks,Suffolk Crosses,Texels,Mules,
{Radnors,Dorset Horn and Welsh Crosses.
{The lambing season}starts just before 
 Christmas and goes on well into the   
 Spring.The farmer has to spend a lot  
 of time with the animals during the   
 lambing season and sometimes his wife 
 has to care for the{motherless lambs. 
{Shearing}is another busy time for the 
 farmer.Shepherds,also,have routine    
 jobs throughout the year,such as      
 regular{drenching}to control worms and
{dipping}to control flies striking the 
 sheep.
