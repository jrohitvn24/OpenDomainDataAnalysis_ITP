		<content> The main area of shops and offices are
 in one small section of our block and 
 these form the main shopping precinct 
 of{Abertillery.}                      
 Here the majority of the people in the
 block shop for everyday items _these  
 include foodstuffs,clothes,hardware   
 etc..There are two major grocery      
 outlets _Kwiksave and Liptons;as well 
 as a Woolworth store.The other shops  
 tend to be locally owned,with the     
 exception of two motor accessory      
 outlets,which are South Wales based.  
 The town has its own family run bakery
 and a local fruit and vegetable firm  
 that has two shops in this area.      
                                       
 The offices in the area are the usual 
 mix of local solicitors,dentist,      
 doctor and agents for national        
 building socities and insurance       
 houses.                               </content>
