		<content>The Brecon and Abergavenny Canal was   
built to take coal to Brecon and to    
transport agricultural produce back to 
the industrial areas.Today the canal   
is used for pleasure.Some people,such  
as the members of Govilon Boat Club    
keep their own boats on the canal.     
Others bring their boats on trailers.  
Small boats may be hired or people can 
choose to take a trip up the canal on  
one of the larger pleasure boats.The   
canal also provides a popular walking  
place.Abergavenny Castle is in ruins.  
A building in the style of a keep has  
been built in the castle grounds and   
Abergavenny Museum is housed in an     
adjacent building.
