		<title>04The River Twrch</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
           The Twrch is a most         
 turbulent stream,(it's name in English
 means wild boar),during flood carrying
 a tremendous amount of water in it's  
 steep course from it's water shed     
 around Llyn-y-Fan Fawr on the old     
 Carmarthen Beacons,to it's union with 
 the Tawe at Ystalyfera.               
           Local geologist maintain    
 that the river Twrch,following        
 generally in a North to South         
 direction, has not always followed the
 course it does today.The Twrch joins  
 the Tawe at Ystalyfera and the sea at 
 Abertawe (Swansea).The change of      
 direction commenced with a cutback    
 from it's "estuary".Today it flows,not
 over Allt-y-Grug,as it used to but a  
 matter of a mile or so from its'      
 original course.                      </content>
