       I bring sandwiches for lunch as 
 I don't like school dinners.Sometimes 
 in the lunch break we use the school  
 computers.In the afternoon we have    
 more leisure subjects like art or     
 music.We learn to play the            
 cornet,violin and recorder.We have    
 rugby or football practice one        
 afternoon a week.We all learn Welsh as
 a second language.                    
       School closes at 3.15 p.m. and  
 after tea I usually play on my bike.I 
 live in Glanrhyd and sometimes play on
 Glanrhyd Primary School field,or go   
 and watch my friends in the swimming  
 pool at Maesydderwen Comprehensive    
 School.                               
       Later at home we enjoy playing  
 card games like "Whist".I like reading
 in bed before I fall asleep at 9.45p.m</content>
