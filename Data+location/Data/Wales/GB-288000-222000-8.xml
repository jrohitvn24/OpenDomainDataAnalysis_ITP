		<content> The Crown Allotment was sold and it   
 passed into the hands of John Christie
 (1774 ? - 1858) an indigo merchant of 
 London.  It has survived almost comple
 -tely intact as a single unit to the  
 present day and it now represents one 
 of the largest single farms in        
 Britain.  It is known as CNEWR ESTATES
 Ltd. after the farmhouse in the centre
 of the Crown Allotment built by       
 Chrisitie in 1821.  As part of the    
 requirements of the Enclosure Act, he 
 was obliged to fence in the Crown     
 Allotment. This was done by means of  
 dry stone walls,parts of which can    
 still be seen today.
