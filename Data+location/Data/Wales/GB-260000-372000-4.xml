		<content> In comparing the present situation    
 with the O.S. old series map of 1860  
 it is apparent that the land on the   
 coastal strip has been much improved  
 over the last 100 years. the old map  
 shows several streams crossing the    
 fields, whilst now they have been     
 diverted into well defined channels   
 thereby improving the drainage and    
 usefulness of the land. There is also 
 evidence that some sea defence work   
 has been carried out over the years   
 in the form of an embankment along the
 shore.
