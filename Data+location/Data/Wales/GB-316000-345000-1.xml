		<title>01The Blue Pool ref.186478</title>
		<content>{ The Blue Pool}can be found on the top
 of the Horse Shoe Pass It is the      
 remains of a slate quarry called Moel 
 y Fean. Near it is a cafe and there is
 a track going to it which is also used
 by motor bikes.The quarry is disused. 
 Sub-aqua clubs from all over Britain  
 use it. It is 45 feet deep and there  
 are hardly any plants and no fish. The
 colour comes from the slate. There    
 are cars in it. The water is very     
 clear.                                
{The Green Pool}.                      
 It  can be found in the same place as 
 the Blue pool but it is not on the    
 track. It is bigger than the blue     
 pool. The green pool is also used by  
 divers from all over Britain and is 65
 feet deep with no fish and hardly any 
 plants. It has a few cars at the      
 bottom but none on the banks.
