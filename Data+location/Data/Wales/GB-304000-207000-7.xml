		<title>07The Sinclair C5 electric car</title>
		<content> Earlier this year 1985 there was a    
 rather special event in the Rhydycar  
 Leisure Centre in Merthyr.Thousands   
 of people turned up to see the        
 Sinclair C5 electric car.This was     
 being built at the local Hoover       
 washing machine factory.Local people  
 were really excited about this because
 if the car sold well it would mean new
 jobs for Merthyr.We queued for ages   
 but at last were let in.As we went in 
 we were given tee-shirts,hats and pens
 each with a picture of the C5 on the  
 front.I was surprised when I saw the  
 C5 it was made from a white plastic   
 material.My father said the bodywork  
 was made all in one piece so it was   
 strong.It was very low and it had     
 three wheels,one at the front and two 
 behind.It had no steering wheel but a 
 handlebar underneath the driver's legs
 It had no roof.                       </content>
