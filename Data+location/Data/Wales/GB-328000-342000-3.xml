		<content> For a century,Ruabon has been famous  
 for the distinctive red products of   
 its two brickworks employing some 200 
 men.Few people in Ruabon              
 today,however,rely on the clay pit for
 a living.                             
 The many small pits of the 19th       
 century now only provide work for a   
 few men at Bersham Colliery 5 miles   
 away.                                 
 Ruabon used to be a busy GWR junction 
 in North Wales providing work for many
 of the working population.However,in  
 1960 the line to Barmouth was closed  
 and the jobs on the railway at Ruabon 
 declined rapidly.                     
 A chemical company,a gas engineering  
 works and an idustrial estate of small
 factories now employ many.The local   
 authority employs many to serve a     
 large housing and leisure complex at  
 Plas Madoc,Acrefair.                  </content>
