		<title>04SCOVESTON FORT</title>
		<content>   {Scoveston fort}was built in{1861_5.
 It was to be used to defend the Haven 
 and the surrounding district from land
 ward and seaward attack. Of six forts 
 approved by the Royal Commission in   
 1860 only Scoveston was to be built   
 inland. Its maximum armament was 32   
 guns and a garrison of 128.           
    The fort was never used for the    
 Defence of Milford Haven, so it was   
 one of{Palmerston's Follies,}named    
 after the man who had them built.     
 The fort was garrisoned until after   
 the 1914-18 war and in World War II it
 was used as an ammunition store.      
    Since 1950 the wooden buildings    
 have rotted and are now unsafe, but   
 the stone structure still stands firm.
    Its only use now is to store       
 equipment for the{Point-to-Point Races
