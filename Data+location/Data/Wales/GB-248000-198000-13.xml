		<title>13Shopping in Llanelli.</title>
		<content> Llanelli's main shopping area consists
 of five streets which have been       
 pedestrianized,together with a new    
 Market Hall,opened in 1970,with a     
 space for casual traders,partly under 
 cover,and along an unpedestrianized   
 road.Market days are Thursday and     
 Saturday,while early closing is on    
 Tuesday.The Market Hall houses a      
 variety of stall holders  and includes
 a wet fish area and two stalls selling
 the local speciality-Lava             
 Bread.(Boiled Seaweed.)Most of the    
 large chain stores have branches in   
 the block including Boots,Marks and   
 Spencer,W.H.Smith,Woolworth,and       
 Tesco.There are a plethora of shoe    
 shops and Building Societies.A few    
 small family corner shops are left,and
 they make their contribution to       
 Llanelli shopping by staying open late
 in the evening and opening on Sundays.</content>
