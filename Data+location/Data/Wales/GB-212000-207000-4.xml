		<content> Gareth Davies is nine years of age.   
 He writes "I live in a big house.  I  
 have three sisters and three brothers.
 My nan owns a post office.  She has   
 been working for 33 years.  My best   
 food is pizza.  I do not like curry   
 because it is hot.  Sometimes I go to 
 my friend's house to play.  He is     
 Martin Lewis.  My dad has a Humber    
 car.  I go to Stepaside School        
 sometimes on my bike but most of the  
 children travel by service bus which  
 comes from Kilgetty, goes through     
 Summerhill where I live and then goes 
 back to Stepaside where it arrives at 
 about 9.25 a.m.  A lolly pop lady     
 walks up the road to the school with  
 us.  At 3.25 p.m. she takes us down   
 the road again to meet the 'bus.  I   
 have beaten the 'bus home twice on my 
 bike.  I like watching "Street Hawk"  
 and "Knight Rider" on T.V."           </content>
