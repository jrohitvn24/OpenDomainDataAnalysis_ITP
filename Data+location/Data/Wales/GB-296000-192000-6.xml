		<title>06ST.DAVID'S CHURCH TON/GELLI</title>
		<content>   Before 1860 the Rhondda Valley was  
 sparsely populated. Then coal was     
 struck and people came from everywhere
 to work here.  There was only one     
 church in the Ton and Gelli Area,     
 which was called St.Johns. Because it 
 was built near a river every winter it
 flooded so marriages and funerals     
 could not take place.                 
   In 1880 the ground to build a new   
 church on a hill by Crawshay Bailey,  
 who owned the local collieries, was   
 laid at a cost of Â£4000. The opening  
 ceremony took place in 1881.  The     
 Church was built with soft Bath Stone 
 which does not last and the Church    
 needed repair in 1900.  Now the Church
 requires so much repair work the cost 
 would be enormous, so it is decided   
 that the Church will close this year, 
 1985,and a new St.John Baptist Church 
 will be built at a cost of Â£100,000   </content>
