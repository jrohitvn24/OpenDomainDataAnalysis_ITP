		<title>06V.E.Day in Skewen.</title>
		<content> At the moment we are celebrating the  
 end of the 2nd World War.It is the    
 40th anniversary of the ending of     
 hostilities between Great Britain and 
 Germany.                              
 This morning Mrs.Jones's class held an
 assembly in school.During the assembly
 the children told us about Skewen     
 during the war.The German bombers     
 bombed a row of houses and a man was  
 killed.Many people left Skewen because
 it was so dangerous.Tanks in the oil  
 refinery were also blown up.They      
 caused fires which lit up the village 
 and everyone thought that the Germans 
 would come back to bomb Skewen but    
 they never did.                       
 There is a memorial stone in Skewen   
 and so the whole class went to look at
 it.We had to draw it.We found that 64 
 men from Skewen lost their lives.
