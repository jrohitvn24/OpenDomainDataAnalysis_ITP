		<content> THIS IS MAINLY HILL FARMING COUNTRY   
 WITH HARDY WELSH MOUNTAIN SHEEP       
 GRAZING ON THE OPEN MOUNTAINS. MOST   
 FARMS BORDER THE MOUNTAIN AND HAVE    
 GRAZING RIGHTS. MECHANISTION HAS GROWN
 IN THE LAST DECADE AND ALTHOUGH SOME  
 HAY AND CORN ARE STILL GROWN SILAGE IS
 NOW THE MAIN CROP.                    
 CATTLE ARE KEPT IN THE VALLEY,        
 FRIESIANS FOR MILK AND SOME BEEF IN   
 THE HIGHER FIELDS UNTIL MATURE ENOUGH 
 TO SELL FOR FATTENING. MANY FARMERS   
 ARE INVOLVED IN THE TREKKING          
 INDUSTRY,ALTHOUGH THEIR MAIN INCOME IS
 FROM SHEEP. THE FARMS AVERAGE APPROX. 
 ONE HUNDRED ACRES. THE WIVES KEEP     
 POULTRY FOR THE EGGS AND THE CHRISTMAS
 TRADE. FARMERS USUALLY SHOP IN THE    
 MARKET TOWN ONCE A WEEK, TRAVELING IN 
 BY LANDROVER BUT STOCKS ARE KEPT TO   
 COPE WITH THE SNOWS OF THE WINTER.
