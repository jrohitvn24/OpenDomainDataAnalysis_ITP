		<content> Our school isn't a very big  building.
 It was built in 1909 and it has ten   
 classrooms and a nursery unit. Seven  
 rooms have classes in them,one room is
 used as a library,another as a TV room
 and the last as a music room.We have a
 playground but no playing fields.     
 Recently a new cloakroom-corridor and 
 inside toilets were added to the      
 school.Last year two infant classrooms
 were changed into a nursery for very  
 young children.We do not have a       
 canteen,our meals are cooked in       
 another school and brought to us in a 
 taxi.We eat them in our hall.Children 
 start at our school when they are four
 and move through the classes until    
 they reach eleven when pupils transfer
 to Pontllanfraith Comprehensive Sch.  
 Besides normal lessons we do swimming,
 educational dance,gymnastics,netball, 
 rugby,soccer and Field Courses.       </content>
