         The landscape and particularly
 the drainage of the block are greatly 
 influenced by the geology. The rocks  
 of this area were formed during the   
 Palaeozoic era. In the east and north 
 east are Carboniferous Limestone rocks
 which are tilted , dipping gently to  
 the east. These rocks rest with       
 unconformity on the Silurian rocks    
 which underlie the remainder of the   
 area. These are blue grey mudstones,  
 siltstones and sandstones of the Elwy 
 Group in the Ludlow Series.Their      
 structure is more complicated with the
 finer grained rocks cleaved as well as
 being faulted and folded. The main    
 fault is the Cefn Fault which runs    
 from North to South in the centre of  
 the area. This was formed during the  
 Hercynian Orogeny.
