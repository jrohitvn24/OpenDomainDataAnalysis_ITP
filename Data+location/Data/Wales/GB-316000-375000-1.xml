		<title>01PORTRAIT OF HOLYWELL</title>
		<content> The town of Holywell,with a population
 of 9000 is situated on a hillside     
{commanding sweeping views}of the Dee  
 Estuary,the Halkyn Mountain Range and 
 the Clwydian Hills.The bracing sea and
 mountain air and its position which   
 gives easy access to the beautiful    
 city of Chester,the popular N.Wales   
 seaside resorts and quiet country     
 scenes makes it a{pleasant residential
{centre.}It is a nucleated town and its
 High Street has retained its Georgian 
 character-this will be retained within
 the new proposed developments.The pop-
 ulation is housed in large private or 
 council estates with only a few large 
 properties standing in their own      
 grounds.The climate varies so much    
 that crops planted at the same time on
 high and low ground can be harvested  
 at different times.
