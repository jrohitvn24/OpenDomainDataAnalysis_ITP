		<content> Our gardens bear witness to our love  
 of gardening. Walking is enjoyed too. 
 Many women knit and sew. We have a    
 number of gifted artists and          
 photographers and we have annual      
 exhibitions of their work. Famous     
 modern stained-glass artist John Petts
 lived here and made the spectacular   
 East Window in Llansteffan Church. Our
 particular local charity is the Coomb 
 Cheshire Home. The Women's Institutes 
 make a noticeable contribution to     
 community life. Many retired people   
 join Llansteffan Evergreen club. There
 are amenity groups e.g. Local History 
 society, CPRW and West Wales Nature   
 Conservation Trust. We have no Young  
 Farmers Club but young people join    
 nearby clubs. We have Brownie Guides, 
 Cub Scouts and a school PTA. Farmers  
 have the National Farmers' Union and  
 the Farmers' Union of Wales.          </content>
