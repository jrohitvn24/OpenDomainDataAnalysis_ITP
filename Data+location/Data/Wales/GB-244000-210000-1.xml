		<content>      The area is very beautiful with  
 rich green meadows, rolling hills and 
 valleys with small streams.           
 Electricity pylons mar some of the    
 beauty.                               
      Agriculture is the main form of  
 employment.                           
      There are two 'B' roads running  
 through this area, the B4306          
 Pontyberem - Carmarthen and B4309     
 Pontyates - Carmarthen.  All other    
 roads are minor roads.                
      The two villages are on the B4309
 road, one is known as Meinciau, the   
 other is Pontantwn.  Meinciau is the  
 larger, with council and private      
 houses, bungalows, a public house     
 known as the Black Horse, a recreation
 area with sports field, petrol station
 and chapel.                           
      Pontantwn only has a few houses, 
 bungalows and petrol/service garage.  </content>
