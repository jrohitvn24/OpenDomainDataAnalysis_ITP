		<title>09HOME LIFE MY HOME</title>
		<content> My house is detached and made with red
 brick and has a slated roof.It is     
 situated in the upper part of Gilwern 
 in Winsford Grove,and is 9 years old  
 like the rest in our road.It has 12   
 rooms which are:a                     
 kitchen,lounge,dining room,4 bedrooms,
 one bath room with a toilet and       
 shower,a downstairs toilet and        
 basin,large utility room and garage.  
 The kitchen contains an electric      
 hob,twin oven and a breakfast area.The
 lounge was seperated in half to be a  
 dining room but now we have had an    
 extension.The study used to be the    
 garage until another one was built and
 the previous one was turned into a    
 study.2 of the bedrooms are large and 
 the others are fairly small.In the    
 utility room we keep the washing      
 machine and our outdoor toys.My house 
 has electricity and gas.              </content>
