		<title>03PRECINCT TRADERS, RHYL</title>
		<content>  Of the 24 shops open, 12 are part of 
 a national chain, 6 are members of a  
 large group and 6 are privately owned.
 11 had premises in Rhyl previously    
 and, of these, 9 have closed their    
 other shop and say trade is better in 
 the precinct.                         
  All the traders said weather affected
 business in that more people came into
 the precinct in bad weather. Only one 
 trader was disappointed with trade and
 two said it was only fair. The main   
 advantage of having a shop in the     
 precinct was the security aspect.     
  Some traders said the precinct was   
 locked too early and they wanted      
 easier access out of opening hours.   
 Deliveries at the back entrance in    
 Church Street could be difficult when 
 cars parked across the gates or       
 traders had to leave a busy shop to   
 carry packages a considerable distance</content>
