		<content> Television receiption in the area is  
 very poor due to the distorting       
 effects of the surrounding hills, so a
 community T.V. aerial has been        
 installed on top of a nearby hill with
 the help of a grant from Mid Wales    
 Development and serves most of the    
 houses of the village itself. Most of 
 the labour for the project was done by
 the villagers.                        
     There is a Friends of Bwlchysarnau
 School Association which provides     
 support for the school, mainly        
 financial for such things as swimming 
 lessons and educational visits. The   
 Womens has recently undertaken a      
 graveyard survey to record the        
 inscriptions and dates of the         
 gravestones. The graveyard is entered 
 in the Best kept Graveyard            
 competition, with some modest success.
