		<content> I live in{Park Road}in Caldicot. It is
 quite a long street and there are     
 about 115 house altogether. All of the
 houses are semi-detached and were     
 built to the same design. They were   
 originally council houses but now many
 have been bought  and people have     
 altered their appearance. Some houses 
 have been pebble-dashed and new       
 windows have been put in.             
    We have recently heard a rumour    
 that there is something wrong with the
 structure of these houses and that    
 they need to be repaired. This work   
 will take so long that families will  
 have to move out while the work is    
 carried out.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
