		<content> A high proportion of people own their 
 own homes in this area,although almost
 50% are council owned or NCB tenancy. 
 There has been no slum clearance in   
 1985.In fact there has been very      
 little in the area because the area   
 did not see the building of houses    
 when the mining industry was first    
 established.The amount of land        
 allocated means that up to 500 houses 
 could be built in the area.The whole  
 of the land to the east of Hengoed rd.
 Penpedairheol has been allocated for  
 residential development.The land      
 south of Forest Park has also been    
 allocated for housing.A maximum of    
 about 50 houses are built each        
 year.Therefore there is land available
 for the next 10 years.Because the     
 houses were built fairly recently they
 are of a good standard,and improvement
 grants are not in such demand.        </content>
