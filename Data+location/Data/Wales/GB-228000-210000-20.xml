		<title>20EDUCATION IN LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> Education starts with Mother &amp; Toddler
 group followed by Pre-school Playgroup
 with 16 pupils, 2 teachers, 1 mother, 
 all voluntary.  Laugharne's VCP School
 has 94 pupils and 5 teachers.  It     
 shares a governing body with 3 other  
 Primary schools.  An informal PTA     
 exists, last year raising about       
 Â£1,500.  A few Laugharne children     
 attend St Clears Primary school and   
 about 9 are taken to a Private school 
 near Amroth.  Selecton at 11-plus     
 results in some pupils going to St    
 Clears Secondary school and others to 
 Whitland Grammar school.  Two boys    
 from Laugharne went on to Further or  
 Higher education in 1985, one from    
 each school.  There are no adult      
 education classes in the area now.
