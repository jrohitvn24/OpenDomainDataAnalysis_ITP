		<content> I started in the GCG Brass Band and I 
 was introduced to an instrument that  
 is like a tuba.                       
 Our teacher's name is Mr, Jones. I am 
 in the juniors. The big band has got  
 28 people all together. The band first
 started in 1893, the band is 92 years 
 old. The name of the conductor is Mr, 
 Morris. The Bands hall is at the      
 bottom of church lane in Cwmgors. I   
 play a cornet now instead of the      
 instrument I had started with. I go to
 Band every Tuesday and Friday on my   
 bike but if it is raining my mother   
 will take me in the car. The band     
 starts at half past six and ends at   
 half past seven. The Band has got     
 different instruments. Here are names 
 of some instruments;trumpet, trombone,
 tuba, cymbals, brass drum and a side  
 drum.                                 
                                       </content>
