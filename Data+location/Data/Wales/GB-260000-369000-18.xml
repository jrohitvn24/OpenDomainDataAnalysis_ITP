		<content> At breaktimes the children go out to  
 play.They play all sorts of games such
 as British bulldog,football,hide and  
 seek.Their favourite game is British  
 bulldog but they have been banned from
 playing it because they were always   
 falling over.They also play on the    
 climbing frame and roller skates.     
          If it's raining and it       
 prevents the children from going out  
 to play at breaktime,they stay in and 
 either read,play board games or watch 
 films.At Christmas they have a party. 
         Most of the infants like to   
 speak English even though they are    
 nearly all Welsh speakers.            
        Their school dinners consist of
 chips,beefburgers,baked beans and for 
 pudding they have rock cakes.
