		<title>19New By_pass - A467</title>
		<content>  The northern section follows the west
 bank of the Ebbw and Sirhowy to       
 Wattsville and the old Risca Colliery,
 crossing both rivers to rejoin the    
 existing A467 at Crosskeys. Work began
 in February 1984 and is scheduled to  
 finish in 1986. 4 kms. of dual        
 carriageway link Pontymister to Watts-
 ville, with a 1.5km single carriageway
 from there to Crosskeys. 60% of the   
 Â£10 million cost is for structural    
 works. These include a 600 m. rein-   
 forced earth wall, 3 underpasses, 5   
 reinforced concrete retaining walls   
 and 3 large road bridges. The Ebbw has
 had to be realigned and a rock cutting
 of 19 m. max. made in Dolomitic       
 Limestone near Blackvein. Shale is    
 being taken from Blackvein Tips -     
 which will later be landscaped - and  
 limestone from Dan y Graig Quarry -   
 which is to become a refuse tip.      </content>
