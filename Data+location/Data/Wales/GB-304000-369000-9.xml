		<content> When we went to the church we met the 
 Archdeacon Celwyn Clos Parry.         
 When you get to the church first of   
 all you have to walk through the      
 lychgate. The lychgate was there in   
 the olden days because when there was 
 a funeral they would rest the coffin  
 along the gate and then the vicar come
 out and they would then be able to    
 start the funeral.                    
 We then walked around the back of the 
 church talking about the windows, not 
 one of the windows is the same and at 
 the top of the windows there were     
 engravements of faces of famous       
 people. They were very artistically   
 engraved. After looking around the    
 outside of the church we went inside  
 and most of the church was made of    
 marble. The windows were very nicely  
 coloured and all the designs came from
 the Bible.                            </content>
