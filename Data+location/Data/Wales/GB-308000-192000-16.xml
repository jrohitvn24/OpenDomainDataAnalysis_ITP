		<content> Housing consists of isolated          
 farmhouses with the exception of the  
 settlement of Cilfynydd.The terraced  
 houseing found here was largely built 
 in the 1890's by the coal owner.Houses
 face eack other across streets,each   
 street stretching along and up the    
 sides of the valley.The typical house 
 has a slate roof,3 bedrooms,a lounge  
 ,living area and kitchen.In recent    
 years the government has given grants 
 to help bring these houses up to the  
 standards required for the 1980's! A  
 sample of 21 houses in local community
 showed the following:-                
 1)16 are owned or purchased by the    
 occupiers
