		<title>01THE LOWER WYE VALLEY AREA</title>
		<content>  The area is one  of outstanding natu-
 ral beauty, the extensive woodlands   
 dominate the landscape and are a plea-
 sure to see at any time of the year.  
 The river Wye meanders its way through
 the valley between England and Wales. 
 The area is protected by the county   
 councils of Gloucestershire and Gwent,
 supported by the Wye Valley Preservat-
 ion Society. The woodlands growing on 
 either side of the river slopes are a 
 mixture of broadleaf and conifer trees
  The Forestry Commision manages the   
 majority of the woodland and its pol- 
 icy is to keep it open and attractive 
 to nature lovers. Care is taken when  
 felling and re-planting so that the   
 character of the woodlands is not     
 altered.An area warden service has    
 been established and the Wye Walley   
 walks have proved very popular.
