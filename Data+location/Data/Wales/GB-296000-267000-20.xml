		<content> This project was compiled by members  
 of{Rhayader Women's Institute,}each   
 page being researched and written by a
 different member.                     
  The building of the Brynberth        
 Industrial Estate brought light       
 industry into what was formerly a     
 community of farmers and shopkeepers. 
 This caused an expansion in both      
 private and council house building and
 the consequent immigration of people  
 from more industrial areas.           
  Another pattern is now emerging of   
 people purchasing property in the area
 with a view to retirement,thus        
 bringing people with a more varied    
 background.This is highlighted by the 
 membership of our Women's Institute   
 which now has members who came        
 originally from many different parts  
 of the country.
