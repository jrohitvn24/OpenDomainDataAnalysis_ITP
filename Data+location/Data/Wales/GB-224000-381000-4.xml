 Scouts                                
 The first troop was founded in 1909   
 by the Rev.E.B.Jones and registered as
 the 2nd Anglesey Troop.               
 Originally they met at St Cybi's      
 Church but now plans are being drawn  
 up for a new headquarters in Cambrian 
 St.The sum ofÂ£1000 has been built up  
 by various fund raising activites,also
 financial assistance has come from    
 various sources such as,the Prince of 
 Wales trust,Anglesey Borough          
 counciland the Shell oil revenues.    
  The main hall will be known as the   
 M.V.St.Columba Hall and the Venture   
 Scouts Den as the M.V.St.David.       
  The troop held a fun day on Newry    
 beach on July 20 to raise funds for   
 their scheme.
