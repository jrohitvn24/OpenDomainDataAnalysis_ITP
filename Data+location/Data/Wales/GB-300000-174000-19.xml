		<content>   The area has a variety of rock      
 types. The oldest rocks, Devonian Old 
 Red Sandstone, are found south        
 of Aberthin village to Stalling Down. 
 These are overlain by Carboniferous   
 rocks mainly of grey crystalline      
 limestone. These outcrop over a large 
 area and have been quarried for       
 building stone. There are no large    
 quarries in the area.                 
 These are overlain unconformably by   
 Mesozoic rocks and consist of breccias
 ,conglomerates, marls and limestones. 
 These are found around Maendy, Prisk  
 and to the north-west of Aberthin.    
 Trerhyngyll rests entirely on         
 Carboniferous limestone as does the TV
 mast at St.Hilary. The solid geology  
 is partly hidden by Pleistocene sands 
 and gravels deposited during the ice  
 age and by Alluvium deposits of the   
 River Thaw.                           </content>
