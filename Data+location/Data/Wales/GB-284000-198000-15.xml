		<title>15SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> There are many causes of concern      
 within the village but the main one is
 unemployment especially among the     
 young people. The older people are    
 also concerned about the future of the
 village if the young people are forced
 to leave to look for work. There is   
 also concern about the lack of        
 amenaties and the way in which the    
 local council appears to be neglecting
 the village. Old houses are being left
 derelict and if they are demolished   
 the sites are not tidied up.There is  
 also a concern about law and order,   
 there is a lot of vandalism and there 
 appears to be nothing the police can  
 do about it. There is nothing to take 
 the young people off the streets at   
 night, there is a youth centre but no 
 funds to run it properly.
