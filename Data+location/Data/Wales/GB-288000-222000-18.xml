		<title>18TRANSPORT, THE RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The Neath amd Brecon Railway was      
 created in the eighteen sixties. The  
 first passenger train ran in 1867.    
 The railway company finally became    
 part of the Grest Western in 1922 and 
 British Rail in 1948.  The line was   
 finally closed in 1962.  Today much of
 the original track has become incorp- 
 orated into adjacent farm land but    
 there are some short stretches of it  
 which have been little changed apart  
 from the removal of the track.        
 There was a station at Crai, indeed   
 the present hamlet owes it origin     
 almost entirely to the railway for    
 there is only a couple of farms shown 
 on the Crai Parish Tithe Survey maps  
 of 1840 where the cluster of houses,  
 the church and the village hall are   
 now located.
