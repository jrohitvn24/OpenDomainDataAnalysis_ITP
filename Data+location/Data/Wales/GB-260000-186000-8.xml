		<content> Rugby is played in many countries &amp;   
 towns.It is our favourite sport.There 
 are tries,conversions &amp; penalties.    
 There is a full back,two centres,two  
 wings an out side half &amp; a scrum half 
 in the backs.The forwards are two     
 props,two locks,two flankers,a hooker 
 &amp; a number eight.The rules are:- One  
 of the teams kicks off.If the ball    
 should go forward from a hand it's a  
 scrum to the other side.The scrum half
 puts the ball in &amp; both sides push.To 
 score a try you must run to the try   
 line &amp;  put the ball on the floor.    
 If a man should foul another man there
 is a penalty.They can kick or run with
 the ball.If the ball goes off the     
 pitch there is a line out.The hooker  
 has to throw the ball in to play on.  
 Our school has 2 Rugby teams &amp; Mumbles

 Matthew Bowyer and Stephen Morgan.    </content>
