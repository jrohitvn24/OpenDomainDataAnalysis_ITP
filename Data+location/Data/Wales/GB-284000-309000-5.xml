		<content> There is a population of 147 including
 9 students, 22 schoolchildren and 4   
 children of preschool age. The village
 Post Office pays out 23 old age       
 pensions, 11 family allowances, 6     
 unemployment benefits and 14 others,  
 such as sick benefits. Some old age   
 pensions are not paid through the Post
 Office. 84 people are Welsh, the rest 
 English. There have been 3 deaths &amp; no
 births this year. The English and     
 Welsh mix generally in village        
 activities and many of the English    
 learn the Welsh language with varying 
 degrees of success. It is a           
 predominantly aging population.       
 Numbers are increased by holiday      
 makers in summer &amp; children from      
 Dolcorsllwyn are often seen on their  
 walks.
