		<content>  Because the area is reasonably       
 unfrequented by traffic and humans in 
 large numbers, there are numerous     
 birds and small animals.              
  There are many hedgerow birds,       
 woodland birds such as jay, owl and   
 nuthatch also moorland birds such as  
 plover, curlew and pheasant.          
  There are many small mammals, mice of
 many kinds and grey squirrels, some of
 which are surprisingly red in colour. 
 There is a considerable and           
 fluctuating rabbit population and     
 there are many foxes.                 
  Badgers are present but are          
 decreasing in numbers even though the 
 living conditions are ideal. This is  
 due to the activities of badger       
 diggers from the cities and the fact  
 that some landowners consider that the
 badgers are vermin.
