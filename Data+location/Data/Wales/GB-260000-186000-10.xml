		<title>10Windsurfing in Mumbles</title>
		<content>    Windsurfing locally began in 1981. 
 In 1981 only 2 or 3 boards would be   
 seen on Mumbles Bay. Then shops began 
 to sell equipment in Mumbles like Dave
 Friar's and Island Style.The newest   
 one is called Sailsports.             
    In 1984 the Division 2 National    
 Championships were held on Mumbles    
 Bay. It was held on Mumbles Bay       
 because it has flat water.Also in 1984
 there was a sponsored windsurf by     
 R.Lewis from Ilfracombe to Mumbles    
 which raised Â£1,825 for Mumbles       
 lifeboat and took 2 hours 40 minutes. 
    Later on this year there will be a 
 long distance race around Swansea Bay.
 Next year will  be the Division 1     
 Championships.They will be held in    
 Mumbles. You can get a second hand    
 board for about Â£150 but bought from a
 shop they could cost up to Â£1,000.
