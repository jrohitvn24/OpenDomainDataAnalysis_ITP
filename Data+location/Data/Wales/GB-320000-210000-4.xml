		<title>04WILDLIFE NEAR BLAEN DYAR</title>
		<content>  Near Blaen Dyar there are lots of    
 trees and birds as well as an occupied
 foxes den,it is near some old houses  
 that have fallen down.There are lots  
 of birds such as wood-pigeons,buzzards
 and other common birds.There are also 
 trees and plants, some quite unusual. 
  Down the Old Road, (which is near the
 school)there are lots of Beech trees  
 and grey squirrels, some people have  
 been known to see red squirrels but   
 not very often.                       
  During the Spring we always have     
 quite a lot of frogspawn as we have   
 a quite a few ponds.Not many of the   
 tadpoles survive as they do not have  
 enough food.Sometimes we keep tadpoles
 in school.Butterflies are also common 
 in the Summertime.                    
  Lots of our area is Moor-Land.
