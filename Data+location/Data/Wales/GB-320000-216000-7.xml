		<title>07A FARMER</title>
		<content> Mr.Morris farms at{Craig Barn Farm}in 
 Crickhowell. He farms 75 acres on a   
{marginal type}farm which means it is  
 partly mountain land and partly       
 lowland . He has 300{sheep}and 25     
{cattle}with a little{hay.}He describes
 himself more as a businessman today   
 for he buys lambs when they are cheap 
 and feeds them until the price is     
 right to sell them at a profit. He was
 born on a farm and is building himself
 a bungalow at the bottom of his land  
 for his retirement. He is able to do  
 many things himself ,mend the         
 tractor,build walls etc. His farmhouse
 is bathed in sun and has a spectacular
 view which he says is worth more than 
 anything. He believes that you should 
 always try to leave something better  
 than you find it. He is also very     
 clever at training{sheep dogs.
