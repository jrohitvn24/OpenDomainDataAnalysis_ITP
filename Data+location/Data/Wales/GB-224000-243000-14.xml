		<title>14The Penllwyndu Public House</title>
		<content> The Penllwyndu was originally prt of  
 the Blaenpat Estate but together with 
 much other property it was sold off   
 in 1914.  As a pub it was last        
 officially licesed in 1926, although  
 some local people say that beer was   
 still being served there in the       
 1940's.  In those days the beer was   
 brewed in the back room and served    
 in the front parlour.  In July 1985   
 the Penllwyndu reopened with a single 
 bar at the front leading through into 
 a small restaurat, which due to local 
 demand has already had to be extended 
 so it can now seat fifty.  It is open 
 five days a week.  Various bar meals  
 are also served.  The Penllwyndu is a 
 free house serving three real ales but
 as it is within Cardiganshire, it is  
 'dry' on Sundays.  Live music is      
 provided most Thursdays.  Wednesday   
 is darts night.                       </content>
