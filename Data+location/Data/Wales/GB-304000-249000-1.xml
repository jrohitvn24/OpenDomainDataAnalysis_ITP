 Mid-Wales situated on the banks of the
 River Wye,has a population of

 Royal Welsh Show is staged on a       
 permanent site 1 mile outside the town

 original Norman tower being           
 incorporated in the new               
 structure.There are a number of       
 chapels, the most attractive being    
 Alpha,which was built in 1904. {CONT.
