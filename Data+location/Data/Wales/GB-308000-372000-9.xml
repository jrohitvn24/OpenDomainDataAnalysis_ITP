		<title>09SHOPPING AREA STUDY</title>
		<content> A study of 35 households in the       
 village of Tremeirchion was carried   
 out by the children of the village    
 school.One question asked,where do you
 do your main weekly shopping,the      
 results are as follows:_Twenty four   
 people shop in Denbigh,Five people    
 shop at Rhyl.Four people shop at ASDA 
 Kimmel Bay,Two shop at Holywell and   
 one do thair main weekly shopping at  
 Rhuddlan.Why? Because it is more      
 convenient.Because it is the nearest  
 town.Because there are no shops in    
 the village..Because it is cheaper.   
 Because there is more choice and      
 because the only bus route goes to    
 Rhyl.At one time there used to be a   
 Post Office in the village but that   
 closed five years ago.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
