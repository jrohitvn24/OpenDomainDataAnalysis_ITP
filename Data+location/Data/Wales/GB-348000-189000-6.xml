		<title>06CHILDREN'S SHOPPING.</title>
		<content>    We did a questionnaire on          
 children's pocket money and shopping  
 habits in our school.                 
                                       
    Most children under 9 had less than
 one pound for their pocket money every
 week.   They spent their money on pads
 pencils, toys, rubbers, pens, books   
 and sweets.                           
                                       
    Children over 9 got a lot more     
 money.  The average amount in our     
 class of 9 to 11 year olds was Â£1.65 a
 week.  Some children had as much as Â£5
 a week!  They tended to buy music     
 tapes, stationery, records and comics.
                                       
    In a week younger children would   
 spend all their money but older       
 children had a lot left over.         
    The children bought their goodies  
 from shops in Chepstow or Newport.    </content>
