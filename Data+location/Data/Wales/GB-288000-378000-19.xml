		<content> According to older villagers,the club 
 formed in 1921-1922, so that first    
 world war servicemen could play       
 competitive football.They played in   
 various fields in the village,Clip    
 Terfyn field behind  the Fair View,   
 the field where Bron Wern is now, and 
 later on, the school pitch on         
 Minffordd Rd.                         
    There have been a number of        
 internationals,Mr Willie Morris, Mr   
 Iori Hughes, Rev. Hywel Davies. These 
 all played for Llanddulas,or the      
 Quarry men as they were called.       
     The team continued to function    
 during the second world war,as the    
 locals went in to the services.Civil  
 servants filled the empty spaces, and 
 when the war ended local lads took    
 their place.The village had a strong  
 team in the Clwyd League until 1982.  
 The pitch is used by our school team. </content>
