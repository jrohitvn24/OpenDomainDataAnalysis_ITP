 The area is known as the Brecon       
 Beacons, in Welsh it is called Bannau 
 Brycheiniog. The peaks are formed from
 Old Red Sandstone. The highest peak is
 Pen-y-Fan 886m. In the 1950s the 10   
 finest large areas of countryside were
 designated National Parks, to conserve
 their beauty and special character.   
 The area is looked after by the Brecon
 Beacons National Park. The National   
 Park officers advise farmers on       
 developing their land and control all 
 planning applications. They also      
 provide an information service for    
 tourists at the Mountain Centre west  
 of the village of Libanus.
