		<title>06An event in Pontypridd</title>
		<content> Something exciting happened at the Old
 Bridge a few weeks ago. There was a   
 huge bang,followed by another and     
 another.A lorry which was going across
 the Victoria Bridge had exploded with 
 about 20 gas cylinders on it.They all 
 blew up and flew through the air and  
 over the bridge. They didn't do much  
 damage,which is a good thing because  
 the bridge is the symbol of our town. 
 There are souvenirs of the bridge for 
 sale in lots of shops and it even used
 to be painted on the sides of our     
 buses until Pontypridd Council became 
 part of Taff-Ely.There are even little
 bridges on top of the rugby posts at  
 Sardis Rd.ground.The town takes its   
 name from the bridge.When it was built
 in 1756 it was called Newbridge but it
 was changed to Pont-y-ty-pridd which  
 means "Bridge by the earthen house."
