		<title>11THE GOWER IS A RURAL AREA</title>
		<content>   Our area of Gower a is very rural   
 agricultural area where there are     
 quite a few farms, I live on a farm in
{Pennard }which is about  two and a    
 quarter miles along the road. The road
 is a main road which caters for all   
 traffic, cars, bikes, lorries, vans.  
 If you follow the road you get to     
{Swansea}which has many shops which    
 sell a wide range of goods such as {  
{food, drink, fashion clothes, shoes,  
{video recorders, stereos, televisions}
 and many other items. In our area of {
{Pennard} there are a few clubs to go  
 to in the evenings for all ages. I go 
 to the {Young Farmers Club}where I    
 have lots of friends who also come    
 from farms. In the club we have{films,
{talks}and a {rally}every year where   
 there are many {competitions}some     
 serious, some we do for fun.
