		<title>13Sarn Show</title>
		<content>  Sarn Show is held at{Gwernygoe Meadow
 on the second Saturday in{August.     
 Admission is Â£1 for Adults and 50p for
 children.The car park is free.At Sarn 
 Show you have all kinds of races.You  
 have some money if you are first,     
 second or third.We have a dog show and
 we have go-cart racing.Your mum plays 
 rounders and some boys play           
 football.There is a knockout where you
 play all sorts of games,and some      
 people from the garage go on a        
 motor-bike.                           
  My mum is the secretary of Sarn      
 Show.The secretary,the judges, the    
 stewards and the chairman all wear    
 badges.In the evening,there is a      
 dance.                                
  I like Sarn Show because you can do  
 all kinds of things like riding on a  
 donkey,or watching the dog show.
