		<content>    Mr.Lewis one of the fathers of     
 children in the school has lived in   
 Wiston all his life. He is a Church   
 Warden and a Governor of our school.  
    He came into school so that we     
 could talk to him and ask him         
 questions about Wiston.               
    The first thing we wanted to know  
 was how Wiston has changed during his 
 life time. He remembered the old      
 primary school in Wiston closing about
 15 years ago. The old buildings are at
 the bottom of the drive to our new    
 school. When the old school closed    
 there were about 20 children and 2    
 teachers,and they transferred to      
 Llawhaden School.All the pupils were  
 able to walk to school in those       
 days,there was much less traffic.     
   There was no school field so the    
 Sports were held in the road outside  
 the school!                           </content>
