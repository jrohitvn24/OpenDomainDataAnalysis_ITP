 local shops in{St. Luke's Road, Pont- 
{newynydd.                             
   The local shops that people used    
 most were{food shops, grocers, news-  
{agents}and{the butchers.              
   They only spent on average between  
{Â£3 and Â£5}in these shops.             
   Most people did theirn main shopping
 in{Pontypool}and some at{Cwmbran      
 because food was cheaper, there was   
 more choice and different shops.      
  {Most people used their local shops  
{regularly}but said that they would    
 like to see{a Hypermarket, a local    
{Marks and Spencer, C&amp;A, and generally 
{more clothes shops,}especially for the
 younger people.

{local shops had changed and that now  
{there were less shops locally.
