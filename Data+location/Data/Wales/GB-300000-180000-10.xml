 and the first church was built by St  
 Illtud's monks in the 6th or 7th      
 century.One of it's oldest graves     
 dates back to 1789,but there are some 
 older graves beneath the church.On

 the steps are made from old           
 gravestones.The present church dates  
 from 1868.Peniel independent chapel,
