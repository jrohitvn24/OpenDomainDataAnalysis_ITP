		<content> Cimla Carnival is held annually on    
 Cimla Common in August. The carnival  
 is held to raise money for various    
 local charities. The carnival begins  
 with a procession of floats led by the
 Cimla Promenaders (the local          
 children's jazz band). There are      
 floats for Cubs and Scouts, Hula      
 Dancers, Keep-Fit, the Fire Service   
 and St. Trinians. There is a special  
 float for the Carnival Queen and her  
 attendants .There are stalls which    
 sell cakes, sweets, toys, plants,     
 books and bric-a-brac.Several raffles 
 are held during the carnival. The     
 money from these is also donated to   
 charities.Activities at the carnival  
 include a soccer match, tug of war, a 
 fancy dress competition and the chance
 to throw wet sponges at a volunteer   
 held in the stocks.
