		<title>06The Welsh language</title>
		<content> Many years ago Welsh was the first    
 language of the majority of the people
 ofRhos.The area was renowned for it's 
 deep involvment in the culture of     
 Wales.Many brilliant scholars emerged 
 from the village of Rhos, to take up  
 important posts both in WALES and     
 ENGLAND.Since then Rhos has seen a    
 deterioration of both it's language   
 and culture due to a number of        
 reasons.The decline of the industry   
 and consequently a movement out of    
 Rhos to look for employment elsewhere 
 was a major factor.                   
   The decline in the language was due 
 to many reasons-important jobs in     
 England,the idea that the English     
 language was essential for people to  
 get on in society.
