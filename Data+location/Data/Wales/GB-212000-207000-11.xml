		<content> Paul Watts goes to Judo. He says it is
 hard work and it can be dangerous.  He
 says, "Sometimes I go out and explore 
 the wonderful wild life around        
 Summerhill.  It is a very pleasant    
 place indeed and only a small village.
 There is hardly any noise there.  We  
 have a shop and a playing field."  He 
 has a hamster called Trixy a dog      
 called Scamp a cat called Smokey and  
 two goldfishes called Tipsy and Turby 
 and a rabbit called Thumper.  Hazel   
 Watts' uncle keeps pigs.  Kerry Morgan
 came from Scotland and likes running  
 in races.  David Richardson likes     
 swimming.  He can swim 200 metres of  
 the back stroke.  Philip's favourite  
 place is the beach.  He is 7.  Melany 
 Davies is 9 and she goes to the lst   
 Summerhill Brownies. She says, "It is 
 fun."  Martin lives in a farm.  He    
 feeds the hens, rabbits and ducks.    </content>
