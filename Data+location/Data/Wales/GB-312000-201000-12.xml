		<title>12School population survey</title>
		<content> Aschool survey was completed in June  
 1984 showing the number in full time  
 education from three years old to the 
 end of their primary school education 
 at eleven years old.The results were:-
{SCHOOL      NURSERY INFANT JUNIOR T0T.
 Elliot Town   36     46     71    153 
 Cwmsyfiog     26     54     40    120 
 Pillipstown   29     51    101    181 
 Brithdir      11     15     28     54 
 Tirphil        9     16     27     52

                         {  TOTAL  639}
  With a fall in the birthrate during  
 the late 1960'S and early 1970'S,     
 school populations have dropped       
 dramatically. In 1971 the populations 
 for the same schools' were 1267, and  
 at that time children entered school  
 at the age of five years old.
