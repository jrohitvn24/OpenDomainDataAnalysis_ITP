		<content> Our area has 5 political parties      
 namely Labour, Liberal, S.D.P., &amp;     
 Plaid Cymru.  We have 4 levels of     
 government, Community, District &amp;     
 County Councils each elected every 4  
 years and  Parliament elected every   
 5 years.  The Labour Party usually    
 controls this area.  The Mayor of Lliw
 Valley, a resident of Alltwen, was a  
 former teacher in Alltwen Primary     
 School.  We had a County Council      
 election on May 8th.and people        
 eligible to vote received a voting    
 card to take to their local polling   
 station when going to vote. The       
 polling station was open from 08.00   
 until 21.00 in order to give people   
 ample opportunity to vote.  42% of the
 eligible population voted that day and
 a Labour candidate was chosen.
