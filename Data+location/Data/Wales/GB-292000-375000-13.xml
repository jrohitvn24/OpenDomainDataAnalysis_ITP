		<content> St. Teresa Roman Catholic Church was  
 designed by an Italian architect      
 called Mr. Renvolueri who lived in    
 Glan Conwy and was opened in 1934.    
 Built of stone it has the unusual     
 shape of 5 domes - one main dome and 4
 domes leading off it to form a cross. 
 It has many interesting features and  
 well worth a visit.  The Christening  
 font is in the shape of a globe.      
 Designer of internal decor at present 
 is architect Mr. Bill Davies.         
 Parish priest is Mansignor Shikan who 
 is of Dutch Nationality and has served
 the Parish since 1950.  His house is  
 joined to the Church and he is always 
 available to his parishioners.        
 Services: Sunday morning 9.30 am
