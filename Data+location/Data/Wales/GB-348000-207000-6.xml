		<content> Caer Llan Field Studies Centre stands 
 in 25 acres of woodland,pasture and   
 garden,and since 1970 has been able to
 take up to 60 people for short        
 residential stays.                    
 The woods were declared a Site of     
 Special Scientific Interest in l983.  
 Students study many subjects - land-  
 scaping,surveying,biology and other   
 sciences. They come from schools and  
 colleges at home and abroad.          
 The house itself is in the process of 
 being enlarged and rebuilt,a big      
 underground extension being the       
 current project. The emphasis of this 
 work is A) durability - the structure 
 is designed to last for centuries; B) 
 low energy - using solar gains,earth  
 sheltering and dense thermally stable 
 materials and extra insulation; C) low
 maintenance - in years to come it     
 should be very cheap to run.          </content>
