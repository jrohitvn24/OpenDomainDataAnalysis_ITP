		<title>13MUSICAL GROUPS</title>
		<content> There are many musicians in Risca. in 
 our class we have a picture of Risca  
 Male Voice Choir in 1917. Their       
 accompanist, Mrs. Hutchings, is now 92
 years old and still lives in          
 Commercial Street. She is the         
 grandmother of Mrs. Gittings, our     
 teacher.                              
 Many musical groups were begun in the 
 chapels of the area. Bethany Baptist  
 Chapel has a very strong musical      
 background including a male choir, a  
 Sunday school choir, a ladies choir   
 and a jazz band.                      
 Risca has produced many famous        
 musicians including Jennifer Rhys-    
 Davies who has sung with the Welsh    
 National Opera and Jonathan Watts, a  
 brilliant organist.                   
 The Risca Phoenix Singers are still   
 giving concerts and there are various 
 senior citizens' choirs still singing.</content>
