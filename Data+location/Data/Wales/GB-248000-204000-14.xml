 The name of this popular inn          
 translates into 'Wild Meadow'.        
 The present owners have been there for
 4 Years and bought it for its own sake
 rather than because of its situation  
 in the locality.                      
 The owners are keen to maintain the   
 traditional appearance of the place   
 and have tastefully extended and      
 modernised it.Older regulars ralk of a
 ghost causing glasses to fall off     
 shelves but the owner puts this down  
 to                                    
 Future plans include a new kitchen and
 accomodation.At present the resteraunt
 caters for 52 and its lounge can seat 
 110.Juke boxes and video-games are out
 but on New Years Eve a folk singer    
 entertains.20 staff are employed on   
 Saturdays and are mostly locals.20 to 
 30% of the customers speak Welsh.     </content>
