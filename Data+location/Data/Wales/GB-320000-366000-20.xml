{Changes in Rhosesmor since 1945}      
  The village has changed considerably.
 It is much bigger with many more homes
 and people, increasing all the time.  
 There are also factories. The old     
 village school has been closed and    
 partly demolished, the rest becoming a
 private home. It is much harder to get
 out and about now as the bus service  
 is moch poorer and very few busses    
 pass through. There used to be local  
 carnivals and a carnival queen but    
 that has all gone.
