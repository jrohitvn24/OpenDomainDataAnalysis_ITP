		<content>   Mrs. Mary Davies was born in 1595 at
 Shotwick. She was an extraordinary    
 woman because when she was 28 she grew
 3 big bumps behind her ears. When she 
 was 40 years of age the bumps turned  
 in to proper horns. every 4 years they
 fell out, and new, bigger ones grew in
 their place. She got married to a     
 farmer and he protected her. Nobody   
 knows where the horns are now because 
 the were given to some relatives who  
 thought they were Ram's horns and they
 threw them away. Another set were     
 given to friends but were lost in a   
 fire. In the end she died at an old   
 age of 80 and was buried in London.
