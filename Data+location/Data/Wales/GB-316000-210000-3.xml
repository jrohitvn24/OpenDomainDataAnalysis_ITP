{Cannon}is a game for four or more     
 people.You need three sticks 40cm long
 and one 30cm long.Lean the three long 
 sticks up against a wall and place the
 short stick across the top.Divide     
 players equally into two teams.One    
 side throws a ball and tries to knock 
 down the sticks.If they do they run   
 away and the other side gets the      
 ball.They can hide it in their clothes
 and if they hit one of the other side 
 with the ball that person is out.But  
 if the bowling team can replace the   
 sticks before anyone is hit they have 
 won a point.If the ball bounces off   
 the wall and is caught by the other   
 side the bowler is out.
