		<title>17RECREATION _ BORTH</title>
		<content>    Uppingham School donated about     
 Â£1,000 to be used for the playing     
 fields. The boggy land at Wern Common 
 was drained and named Uppingham       
 Playing Fields. They are owned and run
 by Borth Town Council. There are many 
 facilities provided _ a playground    
 with a slide and see saw, a sports    
 pavilion, two tennis courts, a crazy  
 golf course, a large football pitch,  
 BMX course and trampolines, and,      
 hopefully, a cricket pitch in 1986. A 
 person is employed to look after the  
 activities during the summer _ collect
 payments, cut grass and keep the place
 tidy.                                 
    There are local football, cricket  
 and badminton teams which compete     
 against neighbouring teams.           
    Borth Golf Club, an 18 hole course,
 extends from the northern tip of Borth
 to the Ynyslas sand dunes .           </content>
