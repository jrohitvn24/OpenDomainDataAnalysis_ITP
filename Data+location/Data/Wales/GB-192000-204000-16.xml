		<title>16HAZELBEACH REGATTA</title>
		<content>    The{Regatta}has a long history,    
 but the tradition had lapsed until    
 after the Queen's Silver Jubilee      
 celebrations.                         
    Originally the events were for     
 villagers only, but now many do not   
 compete; they organise the{races,}set 
 up and man the{stalls,}serve{teas,    
 organise the{barbeque}and evening     
{Disco Dance.                          
    Most races take place in the bay so
 that spectators at Hazelbeach can see 
 the events.{Competitors}include large 
 yachts, power boats, small craft with 
 outboard motors, rowing dinghies,     
 home-built rafts and sail-boards.     
 There are also swimming races and     
 greasy pole competitions for children.
   {The President of the Day}is usually
 an important guest and duties include 
 the presentation of trophies and cash 
 prizes.  by Mr. J. Garratt            </content>
