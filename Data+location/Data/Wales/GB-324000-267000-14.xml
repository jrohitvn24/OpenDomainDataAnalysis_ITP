		<title>14Holidays and vacations</title>
		<content> Many smaller farmers in particular    
 find it hard to get away for holidays 
 and there are many 'day trips'        
 organized throughout the area perhaps 
 just to the nearest seaside (eg Borth,
 Aberystwyth) or to interesting places 
 further afield. A local travel club   
 has trips abroad on a regular basis.  
 The trips tend to be patronized mainly
 by elderly folk, mothers and children 
 since farmers find it hard to get away
 for any length of time unless a       
 relative can take over in their       
 absence. Affluent families may well   
 take several holidays, often abroad   
 (Yugoslavia is very popular!) in      
 contrast to the majority where a few  
 days at the seaside is their ultimate 
 expectation.
