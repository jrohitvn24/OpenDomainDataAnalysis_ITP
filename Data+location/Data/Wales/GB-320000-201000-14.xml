		<content>{An account written by Kathryn Phelps  
{of Tyr Graig School.                  
 Today is Wednesday 1st of May.My mum  
 woke me at 7.25am.I got up dressed,   
 brushed my hair and ran down stairs   
 for breakfast.After I ran upstairs to 
 brush my teeth and wash my hands and  
 face.Then as I was going swimming with
 the school today,I got my towel and   
 swimming costume ready.My school is   
 Tyr Graig School.My mum takes my      
 sister and me to school in the car.   
 When I reached school I gave my       
 teacher my swimming money and then    
 went to buy my tuck.After registration
 those of us going swimming had to line
 up at the door.When the bus arrived we
 filed on.It takes us 10 minutes to    
 reach the swimming bath at Abertillery
 Today we are practising for the       
 Inter-school Gala and there is alot of
 excitement.                           </content>
