		<title>03GOYTRE CARNIVAL REVIEW 1985</title>
		<content>     It was a sunny afternoon when the 
 carnival floats paraded around our    
 village.We liked the {Army }float the 
 best.The winner was the float         
 depicting the {Quality Street}        
 characters,a man was giving away      
 sweets and throwing them in all       
 directions.                           
     Everyone found something to amuse 
 them when the stalls opened.We walked 
 over to the {football game,}three     
 shots for 20p.,and the person with the
 highest score won a watch.Later the { 
{Fancy Dress Competion}began and this  
 was very amusing.                     
     The children entered {Art}and{    
{Handwriting}competions and also ran in
{races}.The fastest boy was Matthew    
 Minor and the best girl was Karen     
 Jones.We all really enjoyed the {     
{Carnival}this year.
