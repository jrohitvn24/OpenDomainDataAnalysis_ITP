		<title>01Summary of the Area.</title>
		<content>   Most of the area consists of        
 mountains with housing communities in 
 the valleys between. Most of the      
 mountains are covered by forestry     
 though a large part is open grazing   
 land.                                 
   The largest community is{Cwmavon    
 which is part of the Borough of{Afan  
 containing the steel town of{Port     
{Talbot.}Part of the smaller community 
 of {Pontrhydyfen,}known as{Oakwood,}is
 separated from the rest of the village
 by the{River Afan.}This river flows   
 through the area and at Pontrhydyfen, 
 receives water from the{Pelenna River.
 In addition to these housing          
 communities there are several{farms   
 scattered over the mountain sides.    
   Pontrhydyfen is probably most well  
 known as the birthplace of the actor, 
 Richard Burton, who died in 1984.
