		<content>    People are attracted to Pensarn by 
 its beach and the many amusement      
 arcades it has to offer. However,it is
 arguable that the main reason that    
 people come to Pensarn is because its 
 situation makes it an excellent base  
 from which to spend a holiday: a few  
 large towns are within easy reach of  
 Pensarn such as Colwyn Bay, Rhyl and  
 Llandudno so shopping is easy; but the
 advantage Pensarn has over these      
 places is that it is quieter and its  
 atmosphere is much less rushed.There  
 is a large fairground and beach at    
 Rhyl only a few miles away.           
    There are a number of holiday camps
 catering for tourists in Pensarn.     
 Mainly, the accommodation is a static 
 caravan or a chalet, although touring 
 caravans and tents are catered for.   
 There are also many hotels            
                                       </content>
