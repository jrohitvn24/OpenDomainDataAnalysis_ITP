		<title>16THE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The postoffice is open six days a week
 with two half days closed, Monday and 
 Thursday. The busiest time was        
 Thursday morning because that is the  
 day when most people have their       
 pensions. Most of the business of the 
 postoffice consisted of post. Mr.     
 Hopkins told us that on average about 
 three hundred people a week used the  
 postoffice at Edwardsville and        
 although because of the easy parking  
 outside the postoffice, passing       
 motorists made use of it, he did tend 
 to see the same faces every day.      
 Because the postoffice will close this
 month(July1985), we asked Mr. Hopkins 
 what would happen to his customers. He
 seemed to think that although there   
 will still be a post-box here, most of
 them would go to the postoffice at    
 Treharris.Mr. Hopkins enjoys his job  
 because it is busy. Lisa Jones11yrs.  </content>
