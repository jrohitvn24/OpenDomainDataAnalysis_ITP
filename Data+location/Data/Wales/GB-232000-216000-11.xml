		<content> One family lived on a farm in our     
 block between 1922 and 1984 and during
 that time saw many changes in rural   
 life.                                 
 In 1922 they made butter on the farm, 
 and sold it at the local market,later 
 their milk was put into churns and    
 collected by lorry from a roadside    
 milk-stand.                           
 They used horses to work the land and 
 reared or grew most of their own food.
 Corn was taken to a local mill to be  
 ground into flour.                    
 When they first came into the area    
 very few motor vehicles were seen and 
 this changed little until the 1940's  
 when the first tractors were seen on  
 local farms,these were followed by the
 occasional car or van.                
 The family have been involved with the
 local "Garden Show"which began during 
 the war to encourage crop growing.    </content>
