 HISTORY                               
 From the early 19th Century there was 
 a steady growth in the town of Bargoed
 and its neighbouring villages, and up 
 to the time of the First World War,   
 the Rhymney Valley flourished with the
 great demand for coal. There followed 
 a period of depression, and from 1945 
 to the present the decline continued, 
 culminating in the closure of the     
 Bargoed Colliery in 1978 and of the   
 Bargoed Coal Washery in 1981.         
 Production at the Britannia Colliery  
 ceased in 1983 - and ALL the larger   
 factories providing employment in the 
 area were badly hit by the recession. 
 PRESENT - Attempts were made to       
 introduce suitable alternative        
 industry to the area and there are    
 some successful but small local firms,
 offering mainly female employment.{   </content>
