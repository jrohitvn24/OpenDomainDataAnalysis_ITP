		<content> The lordship became known as 'Queen   
 Hope' as a result of Queen Eleanor's  
 possession of it (1283-1290) and her  
 visit there on her way to Caernarvon  
 before Edward II's birth, later to    
 become Prince of Wales.{(Local        
{history)}                             
 The woollen{industry}provided the     
 country's principal export and was    
 extensively practised in Hope and     
 Caergwrle.  There were half a dozen   
 mills existing here in the 14th       
 century.                              
                                       
 The Lordship of Hope achieved a great 
 honour by becoming one of the first   
 'boroughs' in Wales to be granted a   
 Charter in 1359.  In 1402, during     
 Owain Glyndwr's fight for Welsh       
 independance, Queen Hope was sacked by
 his rebels.
