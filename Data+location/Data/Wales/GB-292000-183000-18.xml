		<title>18Walking the footpaths.</title>
		<content>  Last week we walked the footpaths to 
 the west of the village. We crossed a 
 stile at{Cae Garn,}a street at the    
 northern end of the village,and       
 followed the hedgerow across a field. 
 Birds sang sweetly in the trees,cows  
 grazed in the field and wild flowers  
 carpetted the ground.                 
  After crossing a second field,we came
 to an old cottage called{Parc Bach.}  
 The path turned south following a     
 stream to a disused farm called       
{Drefach.}                             
  Here the path ended. Between Drefach 
 and the village the path was removed, 
 in the early '70s.,by open-cast       
 mining.The land has been restored to  
 its former state so we continued      
 through lush fields,following the line
 of the old footpath to the southern   
 end of the village.
