		<content> There are 2 main shooting rules:      
 No shooting on Sundays or Christmas   
 day.                                  
 A white pheasant must not be killed   
                                       
 The keeper incubates the pheasants'   
 eggs for exactly 24 days. This way far
 more eggs are hatched. In the old days
 brooding hens would sit on them but   
 this method was unreliable. When the  
 pheasants are hatched the are put into
 a heated hut with as much food and    
 water as they want for one week. After
 this they are let out into the open,  
 with a net over the pen to prevent    
 escape. Each week they are transferred
 into a larger pen as they need more   
 room as they get bigger. After 9 weeks
 they are released into the woods.     
 There are on average, 2000 pheasants  
 at Llwynycelyn at all times of ther   
 year.                                 </content>
