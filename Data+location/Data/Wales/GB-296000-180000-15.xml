		<title>15The College of Agriculture</title>
		<content> Pencoed College of Agriculture is just
 off the Pencoed by-pass. At the       
 college they milk cows and keep sheep.
 It is hard working at the college, but
 it is not as hard as it used to be.   
 There are five-people working on the  
 farm and twenty-five people working in
 the college. At the college about     
 five-hundred students learn about     
 farming. It is a big place which      
 covers two-hundred and twenty acres.  
 It is sixty-five years old and        
 consists of twenty rooms altogether,on
 two floors. The students have to work 
 five days a week, and each person     
 works six hours a day. At the college 
 people learn about agriculture,       
 horticulture, flower arranging,       
 forestry and farm machinery. The      
 improvements that the staff would     
 like to see are more animals, and more
 plants grown there.                   </content>
