		<title>08LOCAL HISTORY, THE TURNPIKE</title>
		<content> The route along the upper Usk valley  
 has been an important line of communic
 -ation from Brecon westwards through- 
 out recorded history. Until the end of
 the 18th Century the route westwards  
 lay over the hills to the north of the
 present USK RESERVOIR, 10 km further  
 west.  At that time the new turnpike  
 road from London to Fishguard was made
 through the GWYDDERIG valley between  
 LLYWEL and LLANDOVERY.  This is the   
 route occupied by the trunk road A 40,
 which was the main trunk road between 
 London and West Wales until the M4    
 motorway was constructed from the     
 Severn Bridge to Pontardulais in the  
 1970's.  A 40 is now much quieter than
 formerly but it is still the main     
 route to West Wales from the Midlands 
 and Northern England.
