		<title>05PORTHCAWL-A day at school</title>
		<content> After walking for about 5 minutes,I   
 arrive at school,and we have our      
 registration.We then settle down for  
 our work on a typical Tuesday.Our     
 class has 4 groups and we each have a 
 chart to plot our work.We work on Peak
 Maths books, at our own pace,providing
 we do a reasonable amount a day.At    
 10.30am we have a short break.After   
 this we either do English or Topic.   
 We have charts for maths and topic    
 where we record our progress.         
 We can have lunch at school,at home,or
 we can bring a packed lunch.In the    
 afternoon we finish of our work,have  
 another short break,then have some    
 form of games or craft.If we have any 
 spare time before hometime our class  
 teacher reads a story.We go home at   
 3.45pm.
