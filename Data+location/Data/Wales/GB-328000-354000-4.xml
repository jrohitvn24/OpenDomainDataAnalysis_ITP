		<content>  Claire Jones lives on the 160 acre   
 Pant Farm, Hope Mountain with her     
 parents,her older brother Philip,her  
 older sister Sharon and her younger   
 sisters Sarah and Elizabeth.          
  Her parents have to get up very early
 and usually work very hard.On         
 week-ends and holidays the children   
 help out grooming and milking the     
 goats,tending to the horses and       
 feeding the sheep and calves.They     
 often have little time to play.       
  Lambing is the worst time on the farm
 especially if the weather is bad and  
 foxes are busy killing the lambs.But  
 the family still enjoy life and there 
 are many times when they have good    
 fun.They find the landscape is        
 usually interesting in all seasons.
