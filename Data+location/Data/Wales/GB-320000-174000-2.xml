		<title>02Local History of Splott.</title>
		<content> Splott was once a marshland.In the    
 13th century English settlers built   
 seawalls and reclaimed from           
 saltmarshes.They enclosed drained     
 fields and called them plots which    
 led to Splott.The most likely reason  
 for the the word Splott is from the   
 Welsh word 'YSBLAD' which means firm  
 land surrounded by marsh..This became 
 altered to Splott by the English      
 settlers who couldn't speak Welsh.    
     Less than 200 years ago Splott was
 farmland but towards the end of the   
 19th century the need for steel       
 brought industry to Splott.Within a   
 few years Splott changed from being a 
 quiet farming community to a smokey   
 industrial are.Today it is a run down 
 inner city area which is trying,with  
 the help of the Welsh Development     
 Agency and others,to recover from the 
 demise of the steelworks in 1978.     </content>
