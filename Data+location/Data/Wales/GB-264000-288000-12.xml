		<content> THE CEULAN AND LERI RIVERS.           
 There are only two rivers running     
 through our block, the Ceulan and the 
 Leri rivers. They are comparitively   
 small rivers yet have at one time been
 very important in the industrial life 
 of the area.                          
 there was until about two years ago a 
 Woollen Mill on the river Leri which  
 used the water for power and for      
 washing.The Leri Mill produced all    
 types of woollen products, the most   
 popular being the 'garthen' which is a
 tapestry  used as a bed covering.     
 These have been exported all over the 
 World.                                
 The Ceulan Mill which used the Ceulan 
 river finished producing about 20     
 years ago but during the early part of
 this century was the main source of   
 employment in the area.
