 In the 18th century the very old{     
{St.Daniel's Church}was derelict.It was
 restored by the{Methodists}who were at
 that time looking for places of       
 worship.                              
{ John Wesley}was appointed its        
 incumbent in 1772,using it as a base  
 for his local preachers,and visiting  
 it himself on four or five occasions  
 during the following ten years.The    
 church ceased to be used soon         
 afterwards,and it was sold.It was     
 bought back by the{Ecclesiastical     
{Commissioners}in 1849.
