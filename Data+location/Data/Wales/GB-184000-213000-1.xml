		<title>01The area around Bradhaven</title>
		<content> As Bride's Bay comprises almost half  
 the block.   The coastline runs NS    
 here; there is a wide sandy beach at  
 Broadhaven, with cliffs to the north. 
 They are 50-8 metres high &amp; sheer.    
 The countryside inland undulates quite
 gently-average highest above sea-level
 is c. 75 metres, maximum c.110 metres.
 There is uncultivated land at the     
 cliff edges-heather, some bracken,    
 gorse, coarse grass.   Otherwise, land
 is cultivated rough grazing for dairy 
 cattle.   Very little woodland-one    
 small area near Broadhaven.   B4341   
 and several minor roads run through   
 the block.   Well developed hedgerows 
 bramble and hawthorn; good variety of 
 hedgerow flowers.   Rural area-3 small
 villages, older than Broadhaven.      
 Based on dairy farming the main land  
 use.   Tourism is the other main      
 industry here Broadhaven exists mainly</content>
