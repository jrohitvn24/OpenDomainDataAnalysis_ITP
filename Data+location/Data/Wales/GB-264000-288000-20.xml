 block although unemployment is very   
 low.Farming is the main industry in   
 the area and most of the farms follow 
 on from one generation to another.The 
 Forestry Comission employ a number of 
 people in the area as well. There is a
 publishing Company at Talybont -Y     
 Lolfa and 12 local people are         
 employed.There are two Hotels which   
 employ between them 9 local people .  
 The local garage employs four         
 mechanics and there are 5 people      
 employed at the school.               
 That is all the local employment      
 available and people have to travell  
 to the nearest town Aberystwyth to    
 find work, many working at the        
 University, College of Librarians, or 
 the Agricultural College. There are   
 also quite a number working at the
