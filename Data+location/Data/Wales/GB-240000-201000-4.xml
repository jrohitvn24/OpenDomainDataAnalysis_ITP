    Pembrey Fair (June 11th) or Ffair  
 Gwsberys as it is called in Welsh,like
 countless other fairs coincided with  
 some church function or celebration,  
 particularly so as the word fair means
 holiday. It has a long history in     
 Pembrey, and its emphasis and purpose 
 has changed from age to age.          
    Nowadays a funfair comes to the    
 field near the church.All the children
 love the fair and look forward to its 
 coming every year. This little rhyme  
 has been learnt by the children of    
 Pembrey for a hundred years and is    
 still learnt today.                   
                                       
             Hwre!Hwre!                
             Ffair Penbre,             
             Paste gwsberys,           
             A disied o de.
