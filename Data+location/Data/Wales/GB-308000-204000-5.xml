 My father gets up at a quarter to     
 seven in the morning.He washes and    
 shaves before eating his breakfast.   
 At 8 o'clock he goes to work at Ffynon
 Dduon Farm in Pentwyn.First he lets   
 the dog out for a run and takes the   
 horses out into the field.He cleans   
 the stable and puts down fresh sawdust
 for bedding.He warms some milk and    
 puts it in the baby's  bottle to      
 feed the orphan lamb.After feeding the
 lamb he goes to Pant to tend to the   
 calves. After dinner he does more jobs
 on the farm.Before coming home he puts
 the horses in the stable and feeds    
 them. When he arrives home he cooks   
 the dinner and we eat when my mother  
 comes home from work.He watches       
 television with my mother and goes to 
 bed at 10.30 p.m.                     
                                       </content>
