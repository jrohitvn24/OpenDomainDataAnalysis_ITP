		<content> The British Petroleum Oil Refinery at 
 Llandarcy near Skewen has been the    
 major employer of men in the village  
 since the 1920's.It has had a         
 tremendous effect on Skewen in that   
 the village has grown to be one of the
 largest villages in Britain if not    
 Europe.Many houses have been built to 
 accomadate the men who have moved into
 the area to work in the refinery.There
 has also been many smaller businesses 
 set up in the district as a direct    
 result of the oilworks.               
 Recently B.P.announced that their     
 refinery at Llandarcy was to be run   
 down with the consequent loss of      
 approximately 800 jobs.At the moment  
 the Union of the men working there are
 going back and fore to London trying  
 to get the management of the company  
 to change its mind.The future for     
 Skewen,however, remains bleak.        </content>
