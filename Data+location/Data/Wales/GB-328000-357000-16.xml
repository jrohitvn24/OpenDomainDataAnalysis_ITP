		<title>16ONE DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> On the 30th May, 1985 I woke up to a  
 lovely sunny morning.  I washed and   
 put on my new pink boiler suit then   
 went down and handed my mum the       
 leaflet she had to fill in so I could 
 have my ears pierced!  After feeding  
 my rabbit and guinea pig I raced off  
 to my friend's house.  We then caught 
 the bus outside my friend's house.  It
 was hot and stuffy in the bus but we  
 eventually arrived in Chester and got 
 off outside 'Habitat', a very modern  
 store.  We went straight to Owen Owen 
 and went to see the lady who was going
 to pierce our ears.  She was out so we
 went round the shops for a while.     
 Then we came back feeling a little    
 nervous about having holey ears.  She 
 showed us a display of earings then   
 she got out a sort of gun and punched 
 through the stainless earing in my    
 ear.{(Recreation)  (Trade)}           </content>
