		<content>      There are 21 chapels and churches
 in our area. They consist of the      
 following denominations:- Baptists,   
 Church in Wales, Roman Catholic,      
 Apostolic Church, Presbyterian,       
 Spiritualist Church, Methodist,       
 Salvation Army and Congregational.    
 Some chapels are used for other       
 things. One is used as a theatre,     
 another is used as a Christian        
 Conference Centre and another has been
 turned into a carpet warehouse. From  
 the results of a survey undertaken in 
 the area we found that few adult males
 attend any chapel or church regularly.
 Slightly more adult females attend    
 regularly. Most children have never   
 attended a church or chapel regulary. 
 Very few children have been           
 christened. Most chapels and churches 
 hold a Sunday School for children and 
 run an annual outing.                 </content>
