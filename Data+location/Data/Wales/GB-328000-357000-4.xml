		<content> It is interesting to note that the    
 settlement was documented by the      
 Normans in its Saxon form in non-other
 than the 'Domesday Book'. {(Local     
{history)}                             
 During William 'Rufus' reign (1087 -  
 1100), the area became known as the   
 Lordship of Hope, owned primarily by  
 the Stewards of Chester.  Edward I is 
 famous for his conquest of Wales and  
 Caergwrle was involved in this.  His  
 war with the Welsh and the involvement
 of Dafydd, brother of Llywelyn, Prince
 of Wales, prompted the construction of
 two fine stone castles.  The first one
 was constructed by Dafydd with        
 Edward's grant of 100 marks in 1277,  
 but was slighted by its founder in    
 retaliation after a disagreement with 
 the King, who built the second in     
 1282.  Dafydd fled into the hills, but
 was captured and executed.            </content>
