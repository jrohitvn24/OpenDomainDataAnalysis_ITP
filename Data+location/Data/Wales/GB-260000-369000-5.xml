		<content>      The splendid views from the      
 castle make it easy to understand why 
 buildings have occupied this site for 
 hundreds of years.                    
      Beaumaris and the south-east     
 corner of Anglesey with Puffin Island 
 lie to the north. To the east the     
 North Wales coast stretches to the    
 Great Orme and Llandudno. To the south
 rises the mass of Snowdonia,while to  
 the west Scotch Pines line the        
 ridge of Bangor Mountain.Trees have   
 been planted in the castle grounds by 
 several distinguished visitors,in     
 particular,a Californian Big Tree     
 planted in 1889, near the car park.   
      The gardens also contain large   
 evergreens,fine Beeches and Holm Oak. 
 From the Ice Tower leads a path to the
 walled gardens which contains many    
 types of flowers.
