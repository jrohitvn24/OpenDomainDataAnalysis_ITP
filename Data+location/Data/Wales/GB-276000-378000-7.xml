		<content>   Mr.R.Glynn Griffith is a deacon at  
 my chapel and is 87years old.He was a 
 tailor and his father's firm employed 
 12 tailors at one time.When he was    
 young many ships were moored at       
 Deganwy,bringing in timber from       
 Scandinavia,and taking Ffestiniog     
 roofing slates to other parts of the  
 world.Pleasure craft are the only     
 vessels to be seen today.Deganwy has  
 grown in size since Mr Griffith's     
 boyhood as he remembers playing       
 football in the fields where the      
 houses on the LLandudno side of       
 Deganwy are today.He remembers        
 Dafydd Gloi who drove a horse drawn   
 bus carrying visitors between         
 LLandudno and Conwy.Today people      
 travel by train,bus or private car.
