		<title>10Nash Lighthouse</title>
		<content>  Nash Lighthouse was established in   
 1832 to mark the sandbanks off the    
 point at the entrance to the Bristol  
 Channel. The decision to build it     
 followed a public outcry after the    
 passenger steamer FROLIC was wrecked  
 with heavy loss of life in 1830.      
  Two circular towers were built each  
 with massive walls and a stone        
 gallery.Placed 330 yards apart,the    
 eastern illuminant is 125ft.high and  
 the western one 73ft.high.They        
 provided leading lights to indicate   
 safe passage past the sandbanks.In    
 those days each had either a fixed red
 or white light visible to approaching 
 shipping depending upon their         
 course.The low light was abandoned    
 early this century and the high light 
 was eventually electrified in 1971.
