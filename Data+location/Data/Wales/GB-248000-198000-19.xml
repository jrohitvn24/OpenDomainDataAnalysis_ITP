		<title>19Media in Llanelli.</title>
		<content>  Llanelli has its own local weekly    
 newspaper-the Llanelli Star.It is the 
 only survivor of the four that were   
 once available.There is also a        
 free advertising paper which appears  
 weekly.                               
 Television reception in               
 Llanelli is good for the four         
 channels broadcast in Wales,but       
 reception of Channel Four is not so   
 good.We have S4C.                     
 All BBC Radio Broadcasts are easily   
 received.We can also tune in to a     
 Commercial Radio Station-Swansea      
 Sound.                                
  The Borough Council encourage the    
 writing of books on local history.    
 Three have been published by them so  
 far,and othere are in the course of   
 preparation.
