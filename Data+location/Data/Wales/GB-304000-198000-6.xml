		<content> The majority of homes within the      
 Cynon Valley were built during the    
 nineteenth century.The houses are     
 constructed in long staight lines     
{(terraced homes)}along the sides of   
 the valley.They were built very       
 hurriedly to provide homes for the    
 mineworkers and their families.       
 The walls of the houses are made      
 mostly of solid sandstone blocks      
 (taken from local quarries)with some  
 brick,and roofs made of slate imported
 from North Wales. The natural light   
 colour of the stone,has become dark   
 brown or black due to industrial soot 
 and grime and the Valley has a very   
 drab look to it especially on a wet   
 day.However now that nearly all the   
 industry has gone some people have had
 the walls of their homes cleaned by   
 'sand blasting'showing the nice colour
 of the natural stone again.           </content>
