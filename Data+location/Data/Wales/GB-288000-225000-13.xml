		<title>13POPULATION</title>
		<content> The population of the area hardly     
 amounts to 100 individuals, nearly all
 of whom are actively involved in      
 farming or  who are members of farming
 families.  There are no houses which  
 have been turned into country         
 cottages. This is in strong contrast  
 to similar valleys lying further east.
