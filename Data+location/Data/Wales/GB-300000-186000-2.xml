		<title>02THE TONYREFAIL BY-PASS</title>
		<content> A new By-pass is being made around    
 Tonyrefail because of the large number
 of vehicles. The By-pass starts at    
{Coedely and ends at Williamstown in   
{the Rhondda}.A branch also goes from  
 Tonyrefail to Trebanog for the traffic
 going to Porth.                       
 The new road is going to run on top of
 the old  railway which runs beside the
{River Ely.}The men who are building   
 the new road have diverted the river. 
 The new road is being built on top of 
 the old railway because it is flat.   
 The new road is six miles long .The   
 new road is being built because there 
 are traffic jams nearly every day.    
   All the men must wear their helmets 
 in case a lump of concrete falls on   
 their head because they cauld be hurt 
 very badly.So far only one man has    
 been injured when he broke a          
 collar bone.                          </content>
