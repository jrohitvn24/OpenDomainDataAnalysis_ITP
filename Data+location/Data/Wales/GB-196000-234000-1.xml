 The area assigned to Fishguard Junior 
 School is situated to the South East  
 of Fishguard which is situated in the 
 North of the former county of         
 Pembrokeshire.This region is now known
 as Preseli and is located in South    
 West Dyfed.                           
           The block which our school  
 is studying has as its main           
 geographical feature the valley of the
 river Gwaun.The river runs in a North 
 Westerly direction to the sea at Lower
