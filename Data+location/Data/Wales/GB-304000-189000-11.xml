		<title>11An elderly resident speaks</title>
		<content> This lady has lived in Trehafod,near  
 Pontypridd,all her life and she said  
 what a pretty name it was.Hafod means 
 Summer Dwelling and Tre(town) was     
 added later. She said the views around
 the village were wonderful-views such 
 as Cwm George waterfall were equally  
 as good as any view in Switzerland.The
 village has changed much during her   
 lifetime-the number of children       
 attending the school are now much     
 smaller,fewer shops,the chapels which 
 were once the centre of much of the   
 village life are closed,the Welsh     
 language widely used at one time is   
 now rarely heard,and many other       
 changes.However,the lady said that    
 Trehafod has always been and still is 
 a very friendly place and neighbours  
 are very kind.It is a lovely place to 
 live and she would not wish to live   
 anywhere else.(By Roslyn Watkins)     </content>
