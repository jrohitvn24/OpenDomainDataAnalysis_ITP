 Gelliargwellt and Tir-y-rhen farms    
 cover most of the agricultural land   
 with a total combined area of almost  
 500 acres.They are farmed as one unit 
 concentrating almost solely on milk   
 production,with a milking herd of 180 
 Freisian cows,2 bulls,3 beef steers,50
 yearlings and 48 calves,making a total
 herd of 283.Most of the land is       
 intensively managed grass land for    
 grazing and silage production,about   
 150 tons of silage being produced     
 annually.A small amount of Kale is    
 also grown.There are 11 acres of      
 woodland within the farm boundary     
 containing mainly Oak,Ash,Scots Pine  
 and Beech.Beech is also the main      
 constituent of the hedges within the  
 farm.There are also 40 acres of       
 enclosed moorland used for rough      
 grazing,and 1 acre of green wet land. </content>
