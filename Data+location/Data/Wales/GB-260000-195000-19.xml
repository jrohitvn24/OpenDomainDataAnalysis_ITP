		<content> The new road scheme at{Fforestfach}is 
 designed to ease traffic congestion.  
 For many years now the cross roads has
 been a notorious blackspot for        
 motorists.Over the past few months the
 council has been working to make      
{Carmarthen Road}into a dual           
 carriageway .Sadly, 17 houses had to  
 be knocked down to do this.However,   
 these houses were very old and shabby 
 and the residents have been given new 
 homes. We surveyed our parents to find
 out their views.We asked whether they 
 were for or against the scheme.The    
 results of the survey are as follows  
 68%{For,}26%{Against}and 6%{Did'nt    
{know.}Those for the scheme said it    
 would ease the traffic and those      
 against said that it would make       
 crossing the road more difficult and  
 therefore split the village in two.
