        _________________              
 Homelife was very much better because 
 of the lack of television,everyone    
 would crowd around the wireless and   
 listen to the serials that used to be 
 on.On a Sunday afternoon the whole    
 family  used to go out for a walk.My  
 parents, my three brothers and myself 
 would go up to the little brook and   
 have a picnic.                        
 Q.what games did the children play?   
       Hop scotch,and Whip top were the
 favourites at the time,there weren't  
 many toys because the factories had   
 been converted for the war            
 effort.There were a few pre_war       
 bicycles and the children from mining 
 families who had very little money    
 would use an old steel ring or a tyre 
 and push it along.
