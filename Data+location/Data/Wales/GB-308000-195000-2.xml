 is a greenhouse for growing tomatoes  
 and lettuce. At the side of the house 
 there is a large area divided into a  
 rockery, flowerbeds and fruit trees.  
 We have family living close by.My     
 mother's parents live in the village  
 of Quakers Yard which is about one    
 mile away. On my mother's side of the 
 family there are Italian and French   
 connections and on my father's side we
 have Americans, Londonersand goodness 
 knows what else. My family are nice   
 and friendly and I enjoy visiting them
 whenever I can. Both my parents are   
 employed by British

 offices employed in clerical duties   
 and my father on the technical side.
