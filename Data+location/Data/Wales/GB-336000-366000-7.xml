		<content>{1A's own thoughts}                    
   Without the trees the area would be 
 very bare and it would soon become    
 vandalized and ugly. All the wildlife 
 - insects, birds and animals - which  
 have their home in the trees would    
 also be destroyed. Some are very rare 
 species. The new route for the        
 pipeline is cheaper than the original 
 one. We are very glad the trees have  
 been saved.
