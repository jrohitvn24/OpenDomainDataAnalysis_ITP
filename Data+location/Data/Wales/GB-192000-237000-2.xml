 Since the area is a popular tourist   
 area many small craft workshops have  
 been set up, producing well made,     
 hand_crafted items for sale.  In some 
 craft workshops it is possible to     
 watch craftsmen at work.  Most        
 craftsmen undertake commissioned work 
 as well as producing large quantities 
 of their best selling items.          
  In Fishguard and district there can  
 be found small art galleries and craft
 workshops producing pottery, ceramics,
 glass ware, leatherwork, woodwork,    
 jewellery and original designs of     
 knitwear.                             
  Traditional Welsh woollen cloth,     
 tapestry and tweed is woven at a      
 nearby woolen mill.
