		<title>15ST.PETER'S CHURCH GOYTRE</title>
		<content>     The church belongs to the Church  
 of Wales.Its map reference is         
{328/059,}just north-east of Wern Wood.
 It is in a beautiful setting and has a
 large graveyard.From a stone on the   
 wall of the nave it is learnt that the
 church was rebuilt in{1845-6.         
    Originally, the first rector began 
 work in{1539,}he was called Hugh      
 Johns. Until about{1860}services were 
 conducted in Welsh then, by degrees,  
 these were discontinued.Rev.H.J.T.    
 Richards,(Rector from 1969-82),told us
 that a new vestry was built in 1982.  
 The Rectory is an impressive house,   
 built in 1891, about 100 yards from   
 the churchyard.He told us of changes  
 that had taken place in church        
 services,such as Holy Eucharist,      
 (Communion) in recent years.He told us
 he enjoyed all his church work in     
 particular the chance to meet people. </content>
