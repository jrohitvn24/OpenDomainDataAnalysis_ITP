		<title>08FARMING,MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP</title>
		<content> The ewe lambs are moved to lowland    
 or coastal pastures for the duration  
 of the winter.  This pratice of trans-
 humance is locally known as "tacking".
 The preferred localities for these    
 sheep to winter are in West Wales and 
 some farms have had the same arrange- 
 mnts in force for many decades.       
 The breeding ewes winter on the farms 
 and are brought down to the lower     
 fields for lambing.  Because of the   
 cold, wet winter and early spring,    
 lambing only starts in late-March and 
 continues through April.              
 Most of the farms adjoining Fforest   
 Fach have grazing rights upon the     
 hill.  This is not strictly common    
 land as elsewhere, but the size of    
 flocks grazing there means that edible
 plants are always cropped short.  Lack
 of any improvemen of the land accounts
 for the plant communities found there.</content>
