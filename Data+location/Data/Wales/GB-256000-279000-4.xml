		<title>04A Day in my Life:L.Dodgshon.</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7.30a.m,had breakfast and
 got ready for school.We drove in our  
 Austin Montego to my sister's         
 secondary school.I played the violin  
 with the school orchestra in assembly.
 We sang Welsh and English hymns.Before
 break we had a Middle English         
 television programme,after break we   
 did Maths and had another television  
 programme called "Animals in Action". 
 For lunch we had chips,coleslaw and   
 pizza followed by strawberry angel    
 delight.                              
     After lunch break we did a science
 experiment about our breathing.I then 
 had a violin lesson during last break,
 before our Welsh lesson.After school I
 practiced with the school orchestra   
 for a concert.At home I had an early  
 supper infront of the television and  
 watched "Connections".I went to choir 
 practice in Llanfarian before bed.    </content>
