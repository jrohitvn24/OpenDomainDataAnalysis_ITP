		<title>19PLANT LIFE AT PONTSTICILL</title>
		<content> The landscape above the village of    
 Pontsticill is mostly rough grazing   
 land unsuitable for other forms of    
 agriculture.The underlying            
 Carboniferous Limestone has in many   
 places collapsed to form funnel shaped
 swallow holes which pock mark the     
 ground of this ancient plateau area.  
 The plants to be found in this        
 grassland area are low growing and    
 small due to constant cropping by     
 sheep and the effects of the wind.    
 Among the plants to be found here are 
 Tormentil,Thyme,Stitchwort and Herb   
 Robert.The largest plants growing in  
 the area are wimberry or bilberry     
 bushes.These are low growing due to   
 the sheep but they provide a delicious
 berry eaten by humans and sheep alike.
 In patches of wetter ground grow      
 clumps of reed like plants the pith of
 which was used to make tallow candles.</content>
