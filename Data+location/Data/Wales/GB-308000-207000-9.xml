		<title>09RHYMNEY ARCHITECTURE</title>
		<content>    St.David's Church,Rhymni, is one of
 the most interesting churches in the  
 Valleys of South Wales.Although it is 
 probably one of the last Neo-Classical
 churches to be built in Wales, its    
 appearance is indicative of the strong
 Nonconformist influence of the time.  
  A large plain church with little     
 ornamentation its only extravagence is
 a dentilled pediment.It was designed  
 by Philip Hardwicke in 1839 and the   
 cost of the building works was borne  
 by the Rhymney Iron Company.The church
 was consecrated in 1843.              
  To single out an individual chapel   
 from the many built in the heyday of  
 Non-Conformity is a daunting task.    
 However,if only from an architectural 
 viewpoint, Beulah Chapel 1866 may be  
 considered, with its interesting      
 nameplate and round window containing 
 star tracery.                         </content>
