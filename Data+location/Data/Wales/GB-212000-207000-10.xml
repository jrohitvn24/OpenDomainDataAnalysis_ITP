		<content> Today we went to Heathfield Court     
 Caravan Park.  We talked to Joan who  
 was the receptionist.  She told us    
 about the people that came there for a
 holiday.  They come mostly from big   
 cities like London and Birmingham but 
 some come from abroad.  She mentioned 
 the U.S.A., countries in Europe and   
 Korea.  They usually stay for a week  
 or two. We visited the site in May    
 and there were a considerable number  
 of caravaners there.The season goes on
 to the end of September.  The site is 
 round and about the ruins of Stepaside
 Iron Works which closed in l877.  Only
 some of the visitors are interested   
 although the brochure mentions it.  We
 spoke to one caravaner.She came from  
 England and she said she was not      
 really interested in the Iron Works   
 only in the peace and tranquility of  
 the area.They have a Club on site.    </content>
