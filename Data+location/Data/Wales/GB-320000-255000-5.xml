		<title>05HOUSE NAMES IN GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> In our village there are 42 houses;   
 most of these have names not          
 numbers.13 of the houses in the centre
 of the village have Welsh names and 25
 have English names. Most of the houses
 with Welsh names are fairly new. More 
 people seem to like Welsh names than  
 they did years ago. The council houses
 are called Glanravon. This means Side 
 of the river. Our Headmaster's new    
 house is called Cil-y-Nant which means
 Bend in the stream. Another house is  
 called 'Cartref'. This means 'Home' in
 Welsh. A lot of the English names tell
 where the house was or what it was    
 used for.'Upper Shop'shows that there 
 were once two shops.'The White        
 Hart'was an inn. Two old houses with  
 English names are 'Chough Cottage' and
 'The Eyrie'. These have been named by 
 people from the outside who have came 
 to live in Gladestry.                 </content>
