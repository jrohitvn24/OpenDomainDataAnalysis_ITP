		<title>16BASEBALL</title>
		<content>   Baseball is a bat and ball          
 game between two teams of eleven.One  
 side fields while the other bats.It is
 played on a diamond shaped playing    
 area and there are no boundaries.     
    The batting side score runs by     
 hitting the ball then running around  
 the "diamond's" four bases. A run is  
 scored every time a base is reached.  
 All the way around is four runs. You  
 can stop at a base if you want to,but 
 the other bases reached will not then 
 count as runs.Every team bats until   
 all eleven are run out.               
  The fielding side have to get the    
 other side out.The bowler,bowls under 
 arm from the middle of the diamond to 
 the batsman.They can get the other    
 team out by catching them, basing     
 them(Touching the base before the     
 batter gets there) or by bowling so   
 that they miss the ball.              </content>
