		<title>15A Visit to AB Electronics</title>
		<content> On Thursday May 3rd,eleven children   
 viited the AB Electronics Factory in  
 Abercynon.Firstly,we went to reception
 wher we met by Mr. Moses who divided  
 us into two groups to go around the   
 factory.We went to a unit making      
 Sinclair Computers which was next to a
 unit making British Telecom           
 components.                           
 In one part of the factory they made  
 metal connectors for Chieftain Tanks. 
 These parts were made in one part of  
 the factory which had many metal      
 bending machines and lathes.          
 We even saw electronic dashboards for 
 cars being made and we helped test one
 of them.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
