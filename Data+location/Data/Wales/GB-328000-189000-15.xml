		<content>  We carried out a{traffic census}at   
 four different spots.The counts took  
 place at{2p.m.}and lasted{ten minutes.
   All our class took part in the first
 count.This was on{Bettws Lane}opposite
 Newport High School. The traffic was  
 mainly cars with one occupant.        
          Four girls made a count on   
 the {Malpas Road,}just north of the   
 motorway roundabout.It was much busier
 than Bettws Lane but not as congested 
 at 2 o'clock as it is at 9a.m.or 5p.m.
   Another count was made on{Caerleon  
{Road,}just south of the motorway      
 roundabout.This road was also very    
 busy.                                 
   The{motorway}is an important part of
 Newport's transport system as drivers 
 use it to get from one part of town to
 another.We found traffic flow heavy.
