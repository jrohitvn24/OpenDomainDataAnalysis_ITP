		<title>04THE LOWER WYE VALLEY WALK</title>
		<content>   Our school went on the Lower Wye    
 Valley Walk on the 16th May with the  
 Warden Mr.Philip Page.We set off from 
 Brockweir bridge and walked up through
 the woodlands towards Botany Bay.We   
 stopped to look at Brockweir from a   
 field which has been left to revert to
 natural woodland.                     
   We followed the way marked path(kept
 clear by the Wardens)through the Fore-
 stry Commission plantations of both   
 deciduous and coniferous trees.We saw 
 many different wild flowers and heard 
 several Wood Warblers.We went near    
 the Gwent Scout camp at Botany Bay and
 then through the woodlands and on into
 the Whitestone Trail.                 
    We then followed the yellow arrow  
 and spot signs to Cleddon Falls and   
 took the zigzag path down to Llandogo.
 We took three hours to complete our   
 journey.                              </content>
