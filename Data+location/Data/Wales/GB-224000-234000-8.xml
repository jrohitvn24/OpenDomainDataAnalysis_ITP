		<content> Most of the houses on our block are   
 farmhouses.In Llwyndrain and Star     
 there are some terraced houses.There  
 is only one school built in 1876.There
 are two public houses,the Fox and     
 Hounds which is in Cwm Cuch and the   
 Falls which is in Star.There are some 
 bungalows in Star and in Llwyndrain.My
 house is just opposite the school.It  
 is small.We are building an           
 extension.So far we have demolished   
 most of the surroundings.We are       
 living in a caravan at the moment.We  
 are making it bigger because there are
 eight in our family.We have hired a   
 J.C.B.to knock down the walls and the 
 garage that was attached to our       
 house.Our house is going to have      
 about seven rooms altogether.Most     
 people own their own houses.There are 
 no council houses in our block.
