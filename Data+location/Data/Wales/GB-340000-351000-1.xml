		<content> THE MAIN ROAD THAT RUNS THROUGH{HOLT  
 FROM{WREXHAM}TO{FARNDON}IS CALLED THE{
 A534.THIS ROAD IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHT 
 BUT IT HAS TWO VERY DANGEROUS CORNERS.
      ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT  
 HOLT IS A VILLAGE IT IS IN FACT A     
 TOWN.BEFORE WREXHAM WAS BUILT,HOLT WAS
 A MAJOR TOWN IN THIS AREA.            
      IN THE CENTRE OF HOLT STANDS THE 
 CROSS.THIS IS A MEMORIAL TO ALL OF THE
 SOLDIERS WHO DIED IN THE 1st AND 2nd  
 WORLD WAR.IN THE PAST THIS AREA OF    
 HOLT WAS WHERE THE MARKETS WERE HELD. 
 MOST OF HOLT SHOPS SURROUND THE CROSS.
 THERE IS :-
