		<content> ... meetings were held, but people had
 to go to the Welfare Hall in Gwaun Cae
 Gurwen for their entertainment. In the
 hall there was a cinema, a library, a 
 smaller hall and a children's clinic. 
 There were farms and several cottages 
 on the common and a row of wooden     
 houses between Brook Terrace and      
 St.David's Road. Twenty five years    
 later, the East Pit has gone and open 
 cast mining has taken its place.      
 Today only the VG shop and Post Office
 still operate. The Curwen Stores and  
 the Doctor's surgery have gone and the
 two halls are shut. The Miner's Hall  
 is now a coal haulage business. Today 
 tghe village looks a lot tidier. Te   
 common has been fenced in and there   
 are no stray animals. The roads have  
 all been tarmacadamed and have street 
 lights.The houses now have rear       
 gardens and many have been modernised.</content>
