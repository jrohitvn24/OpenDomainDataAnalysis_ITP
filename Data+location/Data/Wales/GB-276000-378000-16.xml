		<title>16TRANSPORT -TRAFFIC MOVEMENT.</title>
		<content> Our social survey covered the movement
 from {Llanrhos} to the nearest town   
 i.e.{Llandudno.}Our result showed that
 the train service was used very little
 due to the distance away from the     
 nearest station.At least 50% owned one
 car,and 62% of the people interviewed 
 used their car to travel the distance 
 involved.                             
   The taxi and the bus service were   
 used by 15% and 19% respectively,     
 showing that the taxi was used more by
 the elderly people due to its         
 convenience. The bus stops were quite 
 far apart,and over half questioned    
 were dissatisfied with the service.   
   A small percentage,4% walked,this   
 again could be due to the fact that   
 well over 80% interviewed were        
 pensioners.
