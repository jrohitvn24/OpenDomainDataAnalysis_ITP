{        ***************               
{The Wirral is flanked by two very     
{different rivers.The Mersey to the    
{east, which is now  considerably      
{polluted, whereas the Dee, situated to
{the west, empties much cleaner waters 
{into the Irish Sea. The Dee estuary   
{opens out to as much as five miles at 
{its mouth. It is made of sand, mud and
{marsh-grass, particularly alongside   
{the Parkgate area. At low tide        
{the area consists of dangerous gullies
{carved into the mud, and it is only at
{very high tides that the water        
{approaches the sea wall at Neston cum 
{Parkgate. }
