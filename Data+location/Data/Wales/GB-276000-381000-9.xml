		<title>09Llandudno: Historical (1)</title>
		<content>{Named after the church (Llan) of St.  
{Tudno,}an ancient Christian saint,    
{Llandudno}developed into its          
 present-day form as a seaside resort  
 in a short space of time.  Prior to   
 1848, it had been a village of approx 
 1,000 inhabitants, situated on the    
 lower slopes of the Gt. Orme.  The    
 principal industries were{copper      
{mining,}farming and fishing.  At their
 height, the copper mines employed 300 
 to 400 men and the area became known  
 as the{'Welsh California'.            
   The resort had its origins in the   
{Enclosure Act of 1843,}most of the    
 common land being apportioned to the  
 Hon.Edward Mostyn.  The present town  
 shows the influence of{careful plan-  
{ning}in its wide streets, avenues and 
 the promenade development following   
 the sweep of the shoreline between the
 Great Orme and the Little Orme.       </content>
