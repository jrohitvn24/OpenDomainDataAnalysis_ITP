		<title>17HOUSES IN ROGERSTONE-2</title>
		<content>I live in a large 4-bedroomed detached 
house.It was built with two garages but
we now have only one as the other was  
converted into a playroom.We have also 
had an utility room built between the  
back door and the garage.In this we    
keep the freezer,washing machine and   
tumble drier.                          
       The kitchen is fairly big and   
has a small dining area in which we    
eat.The lounge and dining room are     
separated by sliding glass doors.In the
lounge is a three-piece suite,a        
television and a video.Upstairs are two
large bedrooms and two smaller ones    
with an airing cupboard.               
      There is central heating and     
double glazing throughout the house.We 
also have a small garden planted with  
flowers and shrubs.
