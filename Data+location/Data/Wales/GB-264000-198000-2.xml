		<title>02Morriston Carnival</title>
		<content>      A{Morriston Custom}              
    In 1947 the first{Morriston}       
{Carnival}was organised.This has been  
 an annual event until this year-1985. 
 Everyone missed seeing the colourful  
 floats and the{fairground}rides.      
   The children in our school usually  
 enjoy the dressing-up part of the     
 Carnival.They hope to see it again    
 next year.                            
   At first the money was used to buy  
 things like pianos- but later on      
 special medical equipment was bought. 
   Many Morriston people are involved  
 in the event -they form "The Morriston
 Hospital League of Friends".          
   We in the Morriston area will be    
 pleased when casualty facilities are  
 once again available at our{hospital.}
   It is developing rapidly and has a  
 great future which we proudly         
 anticipate.{                          </content>
