		<content> The {Welsh Office} is planning an {   
{Eastern by-pass} for {Haverfordwest,} 
 a four lane carriageway along Cartlett
 Road, relief roads for Prendergast    
 Hill and Old Bridge, improvements to  
 Narberth Road, bridges, slip roads,   
 and five new roundabouts. All this {  
{Â£5.6 million scheme}will be within the
 town boundary. Residents are concerned
 that it will divide and damage the    
 town and its facilities, demolish 22  
 properties (including businesses      
 offering employment), increase traffic
 noise, vibration and pollution through
 town, reduce playing fields at Sir    
 Thomas Picton School, to which their  
 children are zoned,and make pedestrian
 access to town difficult over bridges.
 A petition of 5865 signatures calling 
 for an Eastern by-pass only at this   
 time has been presented to a Public   
 Enquiry.  UZMASTON WOMEN'S INSTITUTE. </content>
