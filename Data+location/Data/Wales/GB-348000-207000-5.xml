		<title>05TYMAWR CONVENT,LYDART</title>
		<content> Tymawr Convent,the home of the Society
 of the Sacred Cross,is a contemplative
 community of Anglican nuns. Four nuns 
 came to Tymawr in 1923;there are now  
 eighteen working within the convent   
 and on sixteen acres of land.         
 Life in the community is based on a   
 regular round of prayer,work,rest and 
 recreation. The Sisters work hard at  
 farming,gardening,printing and butter 
 and cheese making.                    
 The daily celebration of the Holy     
 Eucharist is central to the life of   
 the convent,and the recitation of the 
 Divine Office takes place in a series 
 of services during the day.           
 Guests are welcomed at the convent and
 guesthouse at Michaelgarth. Some come 
 for a holiday,others to make a retreat
 or study in the peaceful surroundings.
 Many guests help with the manual work 
 around the convent.                   </content>
