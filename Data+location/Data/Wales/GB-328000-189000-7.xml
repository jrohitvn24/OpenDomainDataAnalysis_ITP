		<content>                 Today we went to visit
{Malpas Church Junior School.}We went  
 into the library and asked Mr.Granger,
 the headmaster,questions.             
   The new school is seven years old   
 but the old school was 100 years      
 old.They have{231 children}in the     
 Juniors in 8 classes.                 
    We saw children working and thought
 the classrooms were small but the work
 on the walls was lovely and colourful.
 There are 2{computers}in the school.  
 The children wear a{school uniform}and
 have a badge.                         
   Sometimes the children do{pottery}  
 and{cookery}.They use a small room for
 this.The school hall is small compared
 with ours at Millbrook Junior School. 
   They have a large{field}and around  
 it there are modern houses.We took    
 photographs of what we saw.
