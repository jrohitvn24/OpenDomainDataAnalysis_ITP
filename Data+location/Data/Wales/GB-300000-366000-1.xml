		<title>01HENLLAN: AN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>       The surveyed block is a lightly-
 populated rural area of intensive     
 pasture and woodland on the north-    
 western edge of the borough of Denbigh
 It contains a dozen scattered farms   
 and the settlement of Henllan which   
 has some 700 inhabitants.             
    Henllan is c.150m. above sea level.
 It derives its name thus:             
  'Hen'(Welsh) = 'ancient';            
  'Llan'(Welsh)= an enclosure fortified
 against wild animals or enemy tribes. 
 'Llan'also means'parish',and the local
 church was first founded in the 6thC. 
 when St.Sadwrn,Priest Confessor,made  
 his home there.                       
    The village has a general store cum
 post office, a single public house, 3 
 agricultural depots,a church and two  
 Methodist chapels. It is a socially-  
 active community,however,with its own 
 Council and several village societies.</content>
