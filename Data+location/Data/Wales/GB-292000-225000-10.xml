		<title>10MR MELLORS OF DEFYNNOG</title>
		<content>  I got up at quarter past seven got   
 dressed and made a cup of tea and let 
 Lady (our budgie) out of her cage.    
 Karen, my eldest daughter, came down  
 so I made her a cup of tea. Then at   
 5 to 8 I made Zoe (my youngest) and my
 wife a cup of tea. Then I went to work
 on my motor bike. When I got to Senny 
 bridge camp I Filled in the paper work
 and had a meeting with my boss. Then I
 repaired underground cables. Later I  
 came home and changed and went to my  
 mum's. We had dinner and fruit salad  
 for afters. Then I went to a Labour   
 Party meeting to discuss the election 
 (Brecon &amp; Radnor July  4th 1985). Then
 I picked up the children and we went  
 home. My wife dropped me off at the   
 pub. I had a pint and talked for a bit
 then I had two more pints and went    
 home and went to bed.    (27/6/85 D.A.
