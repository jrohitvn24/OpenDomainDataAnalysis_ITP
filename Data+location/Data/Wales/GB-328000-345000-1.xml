 of Ruabon mountain and the western    
 side of the block area rises to a     
 height of 600ft and is mainly rural   
 used for sheep farming.To the east of 
 Rhos the land descends gently to the  
 height of 325ft with the village of   
 Johnstown situted along the trunk road
 A483 linking Chirk to Chester.Services
 in Rhos include small supermarkets and
 other tertiary industries while other 
 villages have their own small         
 shops.The area developed through its  
 association with the coal mining,being
 situated on the north wales coal      
 field.The last pit was closed in 1968 
 and much of the land to the east of   
 the block is coal spoil               
 heaps(Hafod).Small light industries   
 have developed in Rhos and along the  
 483 in Johnstown.The majority of      
 people leave the area to work.        </content>
