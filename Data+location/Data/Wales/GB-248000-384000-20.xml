		<content> Every July just before the School     
 Holidays we have a party in The Old   
 School in Marianglas for everyone in  
 the village, and the parish of Llan-  
 eugrad.The food is provided by the    
 villagers, others donate money for our
 fancy dress competition and sports    
 held on the village green.In the      
 evening we have a disco.              
 The first party was held in 1969 and  
 we have had an annual party ever      
 since.Nearly everyone in the district 
 turns up.                             
 The Old School was built as a British 
 School in 1854, and was converted into
 a Village Hall.The building has not   
 changed much, a kitchen was added and 
 outside toilets were built.A Committee
 looks after the Hall and this year all
 the windows have been replaced.
