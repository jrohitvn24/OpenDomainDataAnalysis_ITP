 The Community Centre used to be the   
 house for the headmaster or the       
 headmistress.In 1976 it was converted 
 into a Community Centre.The village   
 clubs meet there once a month in the  
 evenings:--                           
   Monday--Gardening,                  
   Tuesday--Women's Institute and      
 Senior Citezens,                      
   Wednesday--Young Farmers' Club      
   Sunday--Young Farmers'Club-drama,   
 Every Tuesday afternoon a Play Group  
 meets for children who are pre-school 
 age.There are also whist drives       
 and coffee evenings held in it.For    
 special village events the partition  
 between the school and Community      
 Centre is opened, so  everyone can fit
 in - this is when the New Year        
 party,harvest supper and senior       
 citzens' Christmas dinner are held.   </content>
