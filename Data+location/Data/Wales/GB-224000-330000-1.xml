		<content>  Botwnnog is a small village in the   
 Lleyn Peninsula.The two schools,      
 chapel,church and post office provide 
 a focal point for the surrounding     
 farms and the few houses in the       
 village.The area is dominated by      
 farming,many farms suppliment their   
 income by appealing to the tourist    
 trade which is of importance in the   
 summer months.The many caravan parks  
 add substantially but temporarily to  
 the population of the area.           
  Botwnnog and the surrounding area is 
 predominately Welsh speaking          
  In appearance the village is a ribbon
 of buildings from chapel to primary   
 school.To the North it is sheltered by
 a hillside  on which the Secondary    
 school and church are situated.       
  Both schools provide Welsh-Medium    
 education for the children.The Welsh  
 language is prominent in all aspects. </content>
