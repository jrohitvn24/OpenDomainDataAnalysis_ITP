		<title>15A JOURNEY ON THE RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The Brecon Mountain Railway runs from 
 Pant to Pontsticill,the track itself  
 extends two and a half miles along the
 side of a wooded valley with excellent
 views towards Pen_y_fan and Corn Du in
 the Brecon Beacons.The train moves    
 along quite slowly which enables one  
 to enjoy the scenery on the           
 twenty_five minute journey.At         
 Pontsticill there is a cafe which     
 sells refreshments from a converted   
 railway carriage.The main visitor area
 is at Pant where the engine           
 house,cafeteria,gift shop andbooking  
 office are situated.The cost of the   
 ticket is quite expensive for the     
 length of journey but Mr. Hills is    
 hoping to extend the railway in the   
 near future and needs funds to do so.
