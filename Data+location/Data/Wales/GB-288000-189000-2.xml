		<title>02Pontycymer-the Garw valley</title>
		<content>  The Garw Valley is one of three      
 converging on Bridgend. Situated at   
 the northern end of the valley it is  
 the largest settlement.               
  The narrow valley  gives Pontycymer  
 its linear shape. Owing to the high   
 relief, Pontycymer and the valley are 
 socially independent of neighbouring  
 valleys. The river Garw is a tributary
 of the Ogmore and is locally called   
 the"black river" because of its high  
 content of coal dust, although during 
 the recent miners strike(1984-85) it  
 became resonably clean. The Valley    
 derives its name from the river which 
 is rapid and tempestuous,"Garw" being 
 the Welsh for rough.                  
  Pontycymer is based on Carboniferous 
 rocks consisting mainly of Pennant    
 sandstone, and beneath the sandstone  
 the coal seams are found.
