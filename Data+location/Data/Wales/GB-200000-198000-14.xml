		<title>14EDUCATION (LAMPHEY)</title>
		<content> The area around Lamphey is served by  
 one County Primary School in Lamphey  
 itself.It is housed in a building     
 erected in the early part of this     
 century.Prior to that there was a     
 small school near the church.At the   
 age of eleven the children transfer to
 the very large comprehensive school in
 Pembroke.Some of the professional     
 people in the area send their children
 to a private school in Saundersfoot   
 and then to public school,a number of 
 them going to Christs College in      
 Brecon.                               
 The school also takes children from   
 the Pembroke area.                    
 Further education is provided by a    
 technical college in Haverfordwest but
 students have to travel much further  
 afield for university or training     
 college education.
