		<title>11Hawarden Airport</title>
		<content> No. 631 whose aircraft were used by   
 the A.T.C. and A.C.F cadets.   The RAF
 closed with little ceremony on 31st.  
 March 1959 and deHavilland inherited  
 it.   In 1960 de Havilland attempted  
 to produce some revenue by the        
 encouragement of passenger services   
 through what was now officially called
 "Hawarden Airport".                   
 On 3rd April 1969 Cambrian Airways    
 revived the Chester-London service.   
 The flight originated at Liverpool and
 the first sector was claimed to be one
 of the shortest in the world,         
 averaging about eight minutes from    
 take-off to touchdown at Hawarden.    
 Sadly, the Viscount service was not a 
 success and by December Cambrian said 
 that they had lost Â£20,000 on the     
 route.   During one five-day period,  
 only 26 passengers were carried to    
 London and 28 on the return flights.  </content>
