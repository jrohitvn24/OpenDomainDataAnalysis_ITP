		<title>08EMPLOYMENT (LAMPHEY)</title>
		<content> The area around Lamphey provides      
 little in the way of employment.the   
 tourist industry does provide some    
 seasonal employment such as servicing 
 holiday flats and cottages.Apart from 
 this the largest employment field is  
 that of agriculture.There are a few   
 shops in the area as well as some     
 public houses,there is also a small   
 but good quality hotel.Most of the    
 inhabitants however have to leave the 
 area each day to work.the largest     
 numbers travel to the oil refinery and
 the C.E.G.B. power station,both of    
 which are near Pembroke.A number of   
 people are also employed in various   
 jobs in the Pembroke area,these people
 are mainly white collar or            
 professional people.
