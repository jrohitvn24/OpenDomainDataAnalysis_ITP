		<content> After finishing work I have a shower  
 and go to the canteen for a cup of tea
 before catching the bus for home, the 
 bus arrives at Tumble at 3 p.m..      
                                       
 On reaching home I have another cup of
 tea whilst waiting for my meal to be  
 ready, after eating I go and lie down 
 for half an hour. On getting up I go  
 out and cut coal ready for my own fire
 in the house, I riddle the ashes and  
 generally tidy up around the back.    
                                       
 I like to watch the evening news and  
 after it has finished at 6.30 p.m. I  
 take my two Staffordshire Bull        
 Terriers for a walk. Since they like a
 lot of exercise the walk usually lasts
 about 2 hours. When I reach home I    
 have supper and then I watch          
 television until I go to bed about 11 
 p.m..                                 </content>
