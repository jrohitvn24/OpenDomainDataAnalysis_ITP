		<content> Foxes thrive in the forestry areas and
 are hunted regularly, on foot with    
 hounds and shotguns. Badgers seem to  
 be surviving in several sets and can  
 sometimes be seen alongside the road  
 at night. Grey squirrels are treated  
 as pests in the forests. Rabbits are  
 starting to make a come back from     
 myxomatosis but outbreaks still occur 
 from time to time. Hares are very     
 common and their tracks are           
 particularly easy to see in the snow. 
 There are many small rodents such as  
 bank voles and shrews.                
     The birdlife varies from buzzards,
 kestrels, many crows and magpies, wood
 pigeons to thew smaller birds, tits,  
 goldcrests and robins etc. Migrant    
 visitors include swifts, swallows,    
 house martins, cuckoos, various       
 warblers and in winter large flocks of
 starlings and redwings.               </content>
