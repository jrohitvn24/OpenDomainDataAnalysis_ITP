		<title>15GLYNCORNEL HOUSE</title>
		<content>   Glyncornel House is situated on the 
 side of the valley at Llwynypia, in 75
 acres of natural woodland. Once assoc-
 iated with the Glamorgan Collieries,  
 the house itself was taken over by the
 Rhondda Borough Council in 1979 and   
 opened as an Environmental Centre in  
 Feb.l983 by Viscount Tonypandy.       
 Since the centre has been open,schools
 from the locality,other areas of Great
 Britain and from as far afield as     
 Zimbabwe have taken advantage of its  
 facilities.  They study anything to do
 with the environment, such as popula- 
 tion,pollution,plants,insects and     
 local history.                        
 The Rhondda Museum also has a perman- 
 ent exhibition room at Glyncornel, and
 in 1982 the Youth Hostel Association  
 opened a hostel there with            
 accommodation for 60 persons.
