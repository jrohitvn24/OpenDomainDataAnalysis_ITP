		<title>19Life on a farm near Nercwys</title>
		<content>  I am 13 years old and have always    
 lived at Erw Goed Farm. Indeed my     
 family have lived in the same house   
 since my great-great grandparents     
 moved here in May 1851.               
  Welsh is my first language and I     
 could not speak a word of english     
 until I learnt it in school. When I   
 was 3 I went to nursery school at     
 Glanrafon Welsh School and I stayed at
 this school until I was 11. Since the 
 age of 3 I have travelled the 4 miles 
 to school by bus. I am now going to   
 the Welsh Comprehensive School, Maes  
 Garmon.                               
  My home is in a very lonely spot and 
 I have no friends living near. But    
 every Wednesday night my father takes 
 me down to a Welsh League of Youth    
 club in Mold.                         
  I enjoy life on the farm helping my  
 father with the sheep and lambs.      </content>
