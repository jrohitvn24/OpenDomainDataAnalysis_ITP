{THEIR CLOTHES.}                       
 At the begining of this century most  
 of the men wore a white smock (jacket)
  a waist_coat and trousers of thick   
 oat_meal_coloured corduroy. Each month
 these garments were scrubbed clean by 
 the wives or mothers. Ties were not   
 usually worn. On their heads the older
 men wore bowler hats or a soft felt   
 hat, whilst the younger men favoured  
 cloth caps and these gradually gained 
 favour with all ages.In autumn and    
 winter they wore a three quarter      
 jacket on top of the smock. This was  
 usually the jacket of an old suit.    </content>
