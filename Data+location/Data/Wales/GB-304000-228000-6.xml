		<content>       The public library of Brecon was
 built in  Brecon in{1957,}and took two
 years to build. It was near to the old
 library. It  was built on  Ship Street
 because of the central position there,
 and also it would be near to where the
 old  library  had  been. It  had  cost
 Â£113,000 to  build, and ocupies 16,180
 sqaure feet, and has 3 floors.        
   The building was  built as a modern 
 library, with more modern facilities, 
 such as  sound-proofing, and catering 
 for  minorities  such as  very  young 
 childern and invalids. 11 people work 
 there,4 of them fully qualified, with 
 degrees. They  all work 37.5  hours a 
 week.                                 
 The books are ordered from Llandrindod
 where the Chief Libranian chooses them
 . Â£130,000 is spent  on them each year
 and approx 7000 books are requested by
 card holders each year.               </content>
