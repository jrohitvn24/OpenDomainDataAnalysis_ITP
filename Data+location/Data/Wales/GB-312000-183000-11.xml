		<title>11Caerphilly Cheese</title>
		<content> The making of farm cheese dates from  
 early primitive times.   On Medieval  
 farms it was one of the duties of the 
 farmer's wife and daughters and has   
 remained so up until 1939.            
 The Caerphilly cheese market was an   
 open building into which the farmers  
 could drive their wagons to unload    
 their wares.   It was always well     
 attended and the weekly sale often    
 amounted to two and a half tons.   The
 Roath Manor records contained entries 
 concerning the sale of one hundred and
 thirty stone of cheese in 1316.   From
 Caerphilly, cheese was sent by road   
 and rail to S. Wales mining valleys,  
 the coastal towns and Bristol.        
 Owing to increased industrialisation  
 locally, causing heavier demand for   
 milk, the market closed in 1910.
