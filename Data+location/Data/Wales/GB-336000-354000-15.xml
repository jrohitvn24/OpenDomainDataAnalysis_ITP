		<title>15MY WEEKEND (CONT.)</title>
		<content> On Sundays some of us go to Sunday    
 School; in Sunday School we listen to 
 stories  from the Bible and sing      
 songs.For our Sunday dinner we have   
 chicken, potatoes, carrots, peas,     
 cauliflower and gravy.After lunch we  
 do our homework it takes me about half
 an hour to do it  all.After we have   
 done our homework we go to the        
 park.There is a big slide for older   
 children and a small slide for younger
 children,there is a rocking boat,big  
 swings and little swings,three        
 climbing frames and some logs.When we 
 get home our tea is usually ready.    
 After tea we watch Murder She Wrote;  
 this is about a woman called Mrs.     
 Fletcher who solves crimes and then   
 writes a novel about what has happened
 to her.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
