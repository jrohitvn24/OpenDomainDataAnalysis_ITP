		<title>19The Towndweller Part 1.</title>
		<content> In November 1946 a junior reporter    
 came to Pembroke Dock.He married a    
 young lady from the town and has since
 worked for 20 years on The Guardian   
 and the last 19 years as chief        
 reporter for the Western Telegraph.The
 biggest change he has seen in his work
 is that today most people use the     
 phone to supply news whereas he used  
 to walk everywhere to get             
 information.It was his proud boast    
 that in his early days he had been    
 inside almost every house in Pembroke 
 Dock to get a story about one thing or
 another.For major news items the      
 reporter still has to go out to get   
 his information,very often at short   
 notice to catch the deadline for the  
 newspaper.Only this week there was    
 a serious gas explosion in            
 Haverfordwest only hours before the   
 paper was due to go to press.         </content>
