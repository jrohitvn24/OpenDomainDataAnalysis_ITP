		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN AMMANFORD</title>
		<content>  The people of the Ammanford area work
 in 3 sectors of industry.             
  There are those who work in the      
 Primary Sector, working in coal (at   
 Betws Drift Mine), limestone (at the  
 Llandybie Quarry), or as farmers.     
  There are those who work in the      
 Secondary Sector, employed in         
 factories such as Corgy making        
 knitwear, Llan making concrete blocks 
 and Pulmaflex making car parts.       
  Others are Tertiary Employees working
 in the shops, banks and offices.      
  Unfortunately many jobs have been    
 lost in recent years in all 3 sectors.
 eg. Saron Open Cast Mine, John White  
 Footwear and Rees Jones Furnishers    
 have all closed in last 5 years.      
 Unemployment is serious, reaching 38% 
 in some local villages. Young people, 
 especially school leavers, have had to
 move away to find jobs elsewhere.     </content>
