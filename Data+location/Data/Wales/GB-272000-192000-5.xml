		<content>The estuary of the River Neath is      
ideally suited for heavy industrial    
use:it is wide, land has been excavated
to produce dock facilities, and the    
river are accessible from the          
surrounding coastal landscape.This     
location coincides with the lowest     
bridging point, and it is backed by    
a large hinterland in the South Wales  
industrial region. The nature of the   
industry in this region has declined   
in the recent years, and the river     
area shows several examples of this    
decline. The dock area , and some of   
the landing stages are now disused.    
Physically,the River Neath is typical  
of many esturine locations.The river   
enters Swansea Bay at this point,and   
silt and extrusive areas predominate a 
natural channel is evident.The Boats   
which are moored here suggest leisure  
rather than industrial activity.       </content>
