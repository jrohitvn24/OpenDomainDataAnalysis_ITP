		<title>16Rossett Mill</title>
		<content> The mill in Rossett is situated on the
 south bank of the river Alyn. The     
 original mill was built before 1085   
 and was mentioned in the original     
 Domesday Book.  The mill today is     
 cream and brown and has the typical   
 look of a Tudor building.  It was     
 built in 1661.                        
                                       
 The mill was used to grind wheat into 
 flour.  Flour would have been traded  
 for goods which could not be grown.   
                                       
 The mill has been restored during the 
 last ten years.  It is constructed of 
 bricks and oak beams. The windows are 
 original and though cracked are still 
 working. The mill is a tourist        
 attraction to travellers through      
 Rossett and it is hoped that it can be
 opened as a museum.
