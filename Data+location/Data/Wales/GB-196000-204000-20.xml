		<title>20ROADS AND TRANSPORT, BURTON</title>
		<content>    Over the years there have been     
 large changes in the roads of the     
 Burton area. Once, the road from      
 Haverfordwest ended at Burton Ferry   
 and there were small ferry boats to   
 Pembroke and Neyland. Then in 1972 a  
 bridge was built across Westfield Pill
 and the road was extended from Burton 
 Ferry to Neyland. On the opening of   
 the bridge over the River Cleddau in  
 1975 the road system was extended to  
 Pembroke and Pembroke Dock.           
    There is one bus service in our    
 area and the first bus goes from      
 Pembroke to Haverfordwest at 8.00a.m.,
 this also takes children to their     
 Secondary School in the town.At       
 present there are two more return     
 services during the day. The last,    
 also taking children home from school,
 arriving in Pembroke at 4.40 p.m..
