		<content> The wells were first referred to in   
 1740 by Dr. Short of Sheffield and in 
 1760 it was noted that the clear      
 spring water possessed the ability to 
 cure 'scarbetic disorders and         
 leprosy'.  The two wells fell into    
 disrepair but were restored in the    
 early part of this century.  A        
 pavilion, tea rooms and bandstand were
 added.  Caergwrle rock and spring     
 water were sold.  Other features which
 attracted tourists were the Castle,   
 the fountain and pumphouse, and the   
 Bridge Inn.
