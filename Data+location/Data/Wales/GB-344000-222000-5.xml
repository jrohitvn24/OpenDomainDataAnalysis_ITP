		<title>05Cycling the School Bus Route</title>
		<content> I cycled around the school bus route  
 to find out how far people travelled  
 to get to school. Mr Nicholls, the    
 driver, brings the bus from Wormelow  
 every morning. Richard is the first   
 person to get on at 8.15 a.m. He      
 travels 10.5 miles (16.8km) to get to 
 school. Gavin gets on the bus 9 miles 
 (14.4km) from the school at 8.20 a.m. 
 Anthony and Clare meet the bus 8 miles
 (12.8km) away at 8.25 a.m. Matthew    
 gets on at a point half a mile down   
 the road. At 8.30 a.m. the bus reaches
 Pontrilas, 5.5 miles (8.8km) from     
 school, and Emma and Darryl get on.   
 Stephen meets the bus at Kentchurch,  
 which is 3 miles (4.8km) from the     
 school. It was very difficult cycling 
 this route, as the hills are very     
 steep and the road twists and turns.
