		<title>17LAW &amp; ORDER (LAMPHEY)</title>
		<content> Until recently, Lamphey was fortunate 
 to have the services of a local police
 man. He was based in Sageston but was 
 responsible for the Lamphey/Hodgeston 
 area as well.                         
 Now,however,Lamphey,like other rural  
 areas,has to make do with periodic    
 visits by mobile police officers.     
 These officers visit Lamphey and the  
 rest of the South Pembrokeshire rural 
 community.There are three officers    
 responsible for the area for regular  
 policing.Traffic policemen visit the  
 area as and when they are needed.     
 All police services are based in      
 Pembroke Dock
