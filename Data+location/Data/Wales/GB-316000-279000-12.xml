		<content>   Every year on the third Saturday in 
 June,the Felindre Show and Sports is  
 held on a field at Rhyd-y-cwm Farm

 fancy dress procession when           
 competitors parade through the village
 to be judged at Felindre Village Hall.
 On the sports field there are football
 rounders and tug -of-war comptitions  
 for several age groups, children's    
 races, displays of various kinds      
 including motor cycle kick-start      
 demonstrations, karate, vintage steam 
 traction engines and dog - handling.  
 There is a dog-show and there are many
 fair-type stalls and side-shows. The  
 event is organised by the Village Hall
 Committee and the money made helps run
 the Village Hall.
