		<content>  Atlantic College was the first in    
 Britain to organise a cliff,beach and 
 inshore rescue service.Since 1962 when
 the organisation was founded the      
 College has been credited with over   
 150 rescues of which most have saved  
 lives.Atlantic College is responsible 
 for 15 miles of the Bristol Channel   
 coastline.                            
  The lifeboat station at the College  
 belongs to the Royal National Lifeboat
 Institution and it is on call         
 throughout the whole year.The crew    
 wear special coats and trousers with a
 lifejacket that contains all the      
 modern equipment.They are also        
 equipped with 2 different types of    
 hats.Sometimes canoes called rescue   
 skis are used for rescuing people that
 are near the shore.Tuition is given on
 beach and water safety and the        
 handling of rescue skis.              </content>
