		<title>11THE LIFE OF A LOLLIPOP LADY.</title>
		<content> Mrs. Ayres is our lollipop lady. We   
 call her a lollipop lady because in   
 her job as a Saftey Patrol Officer she
 wears a yellow hat, a white coat with 
 a yellow stripe and carries a sign    
 shaped like a lollipop.               
     On a school day Mrs. Ayres gets up
 at seven o'clock. She has a breakfast 
 of toast and marmalade. She leaves the
 house and travels to school on a      
 scooter. She arrives at eight thirty. 
 Her first job then is to change into  
 her special clothes. She wears these  
 so that the traffic will recognise her
 and will stop to let the children     
 cross the road safely.                
     When she has her clothes on she   
 switches on the warning lights which  
 are situated a hundred metres or so on
 either side of the school. These warn 
 motorists to slow down. She then      
 waits for the children to arrive.     </content>
