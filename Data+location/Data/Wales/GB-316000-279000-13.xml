		<title>13A DAY IN  KATHERINE'S LIFE</title>
		<content>     I get up at 7a.m. I have breakfast
 which consists of bacon, eggs and     
 baked beans. At 8.30 I catch the bus  
 to go to school. From 9.00 to 9.30 we 
 have registration and assembly. When  
 this is over we do Religious Education
 and Mathematics. Playtime is from     
 10.30 to 10.50 when I play with my    
 friends. We do some roller-skating in 
 the playground. From 12.50 until noon 
 we do some reading and English        
 exercises. We then have our lunch. We 
 then play outside on our skates until 
 1.15 p.m. when we go into school and  
 do handwriting and P.E. The afternoon 
 break is from 2.30 to 2.45 p.m. We    
 often listen to a story for the last  
 session of the day. I go home on the  
 school bus. I have my tea and then    
 watch "Scooby-Doo" and "Flintstones"  
 on television. I help Dad suckle the  
 cows and then watch TV. until bedtime.</content>
