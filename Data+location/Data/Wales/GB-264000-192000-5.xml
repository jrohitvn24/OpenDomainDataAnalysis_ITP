 In the 1700's Hafod was a great place 
 of beauty.  It was full of green      
 fields,flowers, trees and farmyards.  
{The river water was pure and clean.}  
 In the 19th century the copper        
 industry came to Swansea.  This made  
 use of the coal in the Swansea Valley 
 and iron ore from Cornwall and Devon. 
 The copper works were built in 1810 by
 John Vivian.They became the largest   
 works in the world. With the coming of
 the copper works, life in Hafod       
 changed.  It became ugly, grimy,      
 dusty, smelly, and smoky.{The trees   
{and grass were killed and the water   
{was polluted and turned red.} The air 
 was poisoned and many people had chest
 infections and died before they were  
 40 years old from the fumes of the    
 copper smelting chimneys.             </content>
