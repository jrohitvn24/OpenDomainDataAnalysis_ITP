		<content>Mrs.Whitfield is our representative on 
the Graig Community Council.When she   
came to talk to us we discovered that  
there are 15 members on the            
council.They meet once a month at the  
Bethel Baptist church room.            
   They are elected every four years   
and need no qualifications except that 
they have to live in the area.When they
meet they discuss items like cleaning  
bus shelters,footpaths,allotments and  
the local parks.They get money from the
County Council,and they have persuaded 
the Council to pay for the new public  
hall.Mrs.Whitfield said that she would 
like to stop all the big lorries       
driving through Bassaleg.The children  
said they would like to see the Fort   
View play area improved with better    
equipment.
