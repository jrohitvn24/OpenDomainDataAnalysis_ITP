		<title>19Games on Sarn Playground</title>
		<content> A game we play on the netball pitch is
{Land,Sea,Air and Space.}The object of 
 the game is to get from land,(a       
 semicirle near the school door)to     
 space (the middle part of the         
 playground)or to sea( another         
 semicircle at the other end of the    
 netball pitch) or you can get to air, 
 (the side of the pitch).There is      
 someone on it.They are there to tick  
 you and you are on it then.           
  Another game on the playground we    
 play is{cops and robs}(police and     
 robbers.)There are about six people   
 who are cops and about twenty robbers 
 who have to got to get to the hedge   
 and back to den without getting       
 tuck.If one of the robbers gets tuck  
 the others try to set them free.The   
 game ends when all the robbers have   
 been caught.                          
                                       </content>
