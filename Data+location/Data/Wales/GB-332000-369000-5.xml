		<title>05Royal Air Force Camp Sealand</title>
		<content> I have lived at the camp for two and a
 half years.My parents lived here      
 before I was born.I was born in       
 Germany,and then came to Sealand.Many 
 other children on the camp were also  
 born in different parts of the world  
 like Cyprus,Malta,Scotland and        
 Germany.No aeroplanes are on the camp 
 now,only gliders.The jobs that people 
 do here are cooks,airpilots,Physical  
 Training Instuctors and engineers.My  
 father tests parts of aeroplane       
 engines.There are many clubs on the   
 camp like the Wives' club,Emu club,   
 Bingo club,Youth club and Keep Fit    
 club.We have a gymnasium,squash       
 courts,play grounds,tennis courts and 
 there is a very large sports          
 field.There is also a glider club,but 
 you have to be a member of the Air    
 Training Corps to take part.They have 
 to be very careful with security.     </content>
