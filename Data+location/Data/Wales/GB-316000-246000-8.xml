 churches in the area. Each has a      
 weekly service but Bryngwyn with a    
 membership of 50 has an average of    
 only 15 worshippers each Sunday. The  
 majority of the congregation are older
 folk but some children do go. The     
 service following a set pattern takes 
 45 mins. In August 20 tourists        
 augmented the congregation. The clergy
 man has the assistance of an organist.

 10 or so each week. Chapels have big  
 anniversary services.An organ and a   
 piano are playd by Mrs Mills. Flowers 
 are always kept on the table at the   
 front. Ministers are booked by the    
 secretary and are paid for each       
 service. Preachers are not easy to    
 come by. Dedications, weddings and    
 funerals are all done at Rhosgoch. The
