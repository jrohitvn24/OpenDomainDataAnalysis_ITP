		<title>16FARMING IN BURTON (2)</title>
		<content>   At Brompton Park{Beef Cattle}are    
 reared and they have{100 calves}and   
 200{Hereford Cross Friesians.}They    
 keep sheep and at present have 200    
 ewes for breeding, mostly{Speckled    
{Face}and{Welsh Halfbred;}these are    
 mated with a Suffolk Ram.             
   The only hay made is for calves in  
 the first three or four weeks of life.
 Silage is the main{grass crop.        
   The farm is worked by the owner     
 and his son; and they employ three    
 men.                                  
   The farmer said that since the war  
 the farm has changed from being a     
 dairy farm, with a few{potatoes}and   
 some{oats,}to its present form.       
   He believes that in the future the  
 production of{food crops, red meat}and
{milk}will be reduced.
