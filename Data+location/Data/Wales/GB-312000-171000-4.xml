		<content>  The dominating feature of the        
 interior is the wooden three-decker   
 pulpit, one among only three in Wales.
 The Clerk's desk, lectern and pulpit  
 can be found on these three levels.   
 Across the aisle stands the box pew of
 the local wealthy Cwrt-yr-ala family, 
 whose home still dominates the        
 surrounding countryside.   One of the 
 most unusual features of this church  
 is that the pews are fixed such that  
 the congregation sit with their backs 
 to the altar.   On either side of the 
 altar, oak chairs carved with scenes  
 from the Civil War are a reminder that
 the parish was one of the prizes      
 awarded to Colonel Horton's victorious
 brigade after the Battle of St Fagans 
 in 1648.   However, it escaped        
 Cromwell's reform of the              
 established church.
