{The day and life of Gillian Simon     
   Gillian starts work about 7.30am.She
 has to get the patients up and washed 
 then she gives them their  breakfasts 
 and gets them ready to see the doctor.
 Later she gives them their dinners.   
 A nurse usually gets breaks throughout
 the day for her meals.Female nurses   
 find that men are the easiest to look 
 after in Hospital  and older people   
 the most difficult.She gets about six 
 weeks holiday.The thing she likes     
 about the Hospital is that it is well 
 run and is in a pleasant part of the  
 countryside.She lives in the nurses   
 homes by the Hospital and goes to bed 
 at about 11.00pm.She works 39 hours a 
 week an 8 hour day.She is proud to    
 wear her uniform and enjoys her job.  
   Her most difficult task she finds is
 looking after distressed relatives.   </content>
