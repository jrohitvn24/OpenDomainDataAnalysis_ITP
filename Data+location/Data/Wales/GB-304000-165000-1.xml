		<title>01THE ENVIRONS OF RHOOSE</title>
		<content>    Rhoose is an expanding village -   
 virtually a small town - which has    
 endeavoured to maintain the "village" 
 traditions. The area under scrutiny   
 has four main features-               
{a)Cardiff-Wales Airport.              
{b)The expanding residential area.     
{c)The rich farmland of the Vale of    
{  Glamorgan.                          
{d)A limestone-cliffed coastline.      
 To the east is the town of{Barry(4    
{miles)}and the{City of Cardiff(13     
 miles).To the west lies the main      
 extent of the{Vale of Glamorgan}which}
 is dotted with small villages and     
 hamlets.In{Aberthaw,}a village to the}
 west of Rhoose, there is a large      
{Portland Cement}works as well as two  
{C.E.G.B. power stations.}These two    
 sites provide work for a large number 
 of the population. Most others work in
 Cardiff or at R.A.F. St.Athan 6m.west.</content>
