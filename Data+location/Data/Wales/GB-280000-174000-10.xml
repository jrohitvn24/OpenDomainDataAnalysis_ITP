		<content> Catty and Doggy is a game played in   
 the mining valleys of Wales during the
 1920's.The game is played with 2      
 wooden sticks (C&amp;D).The doggy is 1m   
 long and 4cm in diameter.This is used 
 to strike the end of the catty,which  
 is a short stick 4cm in diam,15cm long
 pointed at each end.The object of the 
 game is to hit the catty with the     
 doggy causing the catty to rise in the
 air,then hitting it as far as         
 possible.You are allowed 3 attempts to
 hit it.After the 3 attempts the       
 distance is measured with the doggy.  
 Each length of the doggy counts as a  
 run.A team is made of 4-6 players.When
 one team is batting the other team    
 fields out,as in cricket.
