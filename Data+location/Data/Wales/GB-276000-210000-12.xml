 snooker halls,one situated in the     
 Miners Welfare hall,one youth club    
 and two swimming pools,one of which is
 outdoor.All the local cinema's,three  
 in all,have closed and their buildings
 are now used for other purposes such  
 as bingo.There was also a Roller      
 Skating Disco in one of the old       
 cinemas but this has recently closed. 
         For adults there are numerous 
 pubs and clubs. Most public concerts  
 or plays in the area are held in the  
 Miners Welfare Hall where the local   
 Arts and Drama club frequently        
 perform.Maesydderwyn school is also   
 used at times.                        
         People here rely heavily on
