		<title>03LITTLE HONEYBOROUGH</title>
		<content>   {Little Honeyborough}is a small     
 hamlet comprising two working farms, a
 church and a few bungalows and houses,
 some of which are modern and others - 
 renovated old properties.             
    The{hamlet}straddles a very winding
 lane which joins the old Milford Haven
 -Neyland-Pembroke road. It is a very  
 quiet{rural backwater}and has only a  
 very small population of about 30.    
    The centre of the hamlet is        
 dominated by a very low-lying marshy  
 area where some derelict farm         
 buildings can be found. From the marsh
 issues a small stream which meanders  
 towards Leonardston alongside which is
 an old public footpath. In this area  
 are a few modern dwellings.
