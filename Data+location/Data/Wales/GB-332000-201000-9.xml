		<title>09DIALYSING (2) LITTLE MILL</title>
		<content> When I became a local,I was adopted by
 an older villager,she became my       
 "minder".She checks my blood pressure,
 helps me with the alarm system on the 
 monitor and supplies me with food and 
 drink throughout Dialysis.This lady is
 in her seventies now and still caring 
 for me.                               
 The machine made a tremendous         
 difference to me,my family and friends
 with my life regulated and to using   
 the treatment three times a week.     
 Tiredness became a problem because of 
 lack of oxygen in my blood.My diet and
 fluid intake are restricted.Dialysis  
 means a continual obligation.         
 Some people in the village understand 
 the illness but others are wary of the
 unknown.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
