		<title>12BLAENAVON FARM - TONMAWR</title>
		<content> For over 200 years the Williams Family
 has been living up at Blaenavon Farm. 
 Olive Williams is a pupil at Tonmawr  
 School; her father was born on the    
 table in the kitchen of the farm. Six 
 people run the farm. They have 15 cows
 and 7 dogs, 2 horses and 1000         
 sheep.They have 10 chickens. None of  
 the animals are pets - they all work. 
 They have a hay barn, six stalls,a    
 stable, a shearing shed and a hay     
 bailer. They have 500 acres of land,  
 so they have plenty of land for the   
 sheep to feed on. They grow hay for   
 their own animals. They have just     
 finished shearing and have 13 big     
 bails of wool - each on is about 2    
 metres by 3 metres. It takes about 2  
 days to shear all the sheep.
