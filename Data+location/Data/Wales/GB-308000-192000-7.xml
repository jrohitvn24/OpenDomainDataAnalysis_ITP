		<title>07Abercynon's Youth Activities</title>
		<content> The youth of our Domesday Block enjoy 
 a typical range of{recreation}        
 facilities.  The main attraction of   
 the area is the{leisure centre}which  
 has a {swimming pool,}football,       
 squash, netball and badminton courts. 
 The centre was opened in 1974 and is  
 part of Abercynon Park which also has 
 tennis courts and outdoor pitches for 
 soccer, rugby and cricket as well as a
 bowling green for theolder people.    
 There are a number of {clubs} in the  
 area where young people can take part 
 in a wide range of activities.  There 
 are Guides, Brownies, Scouts and Cubs 
 as well as Youth Clubs.  When we      
 interviewed the assistant manager of  
 the Leisure Centre he told us of plans
 to open up a roller skating rink and  
 that competitions with other centres  
 in the area were stopped because they 
 had become too expensive to run.      </content>
