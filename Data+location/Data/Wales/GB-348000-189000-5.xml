		<content>    Everyday clothes for girls under 11
 are usually a skirt and jumper or a   
 dress.  Some girls wear uniform to    
 school but we don't.  Sports shoes are
 very popular and we call them         
 trainers.  To play in, girls wear     
 shorts and t-shirts or a track suit.  
 For best wear, girls have pretty      
 dresses, fashionable ankle-socks and  
 leather sandals.  Some girls wear     
 luminous socks!                       
    Young boys wear long trousers or   
 denim jeans, a t-shirt and jumper,    
 short socks and trainers.  The most   
 popular outer clothing is a nylon     
 anorak.  Sometimes boys wear body     
 warmers which are sleeveless jackets. 
 Zip fasteners are very fashionable.   
    Boys and girls wear brief          
 underpants and sometimes vests as     
 well.  Girls also wear pretty         
 petticoats.                           </content>
