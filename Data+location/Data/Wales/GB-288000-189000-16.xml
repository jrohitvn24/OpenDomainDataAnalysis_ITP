		<title>16Mr Ben Jones of Pontycymer</title>
		<content>  Born in 1902, he spent most of his   
 lifetime, for years as a teacher. His 
 fondest memory is of the independence 
 of the people, a close knit community 
 united by the hardships of the common 
 ocupation, coal mining.               
  The early years of mining were       
 followed by disputes aimed at         
 improving pay and working conditions, 
 The first nalional strike was in 1921 
 and as there was no Welfare State, the
 miners were not cushioned against the 
 evils of unemployment.                
  Familieslived in dire poverty. Soup  
 kitchens in the chapel vestre; boots  
 from the Lord Mayors fund, holiday    
 camps for the most deserving children 
 provided by the Local Council, all    
 aimed at alleviating the misery.
