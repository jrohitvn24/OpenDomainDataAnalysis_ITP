		<content> There are many fairly small, family   
 run mixed farms in our block. A       
 typical farm would consist of 100 to  
 150 acres of rough grazing and        
 cultivated land. There would be       
 between 90 and 100 milking cows on the
 lower land, between 20 and 30 beef    
 cattle on the higher ground.All the   
 family would be involed in running the
 farm and some employ a farm labourer. 
 The farm would carry around 80 sheep  
 and 2 or 3 rams.The farmer either uses
 artificial insemination or hires a    
 bull for 3-4 months.Most farms have   
 hens to supply their own eggs and some
 have ducks,turkeys and geese for the  
 Christmas market. Every farm has 2 or 
 3 dogs to help round up the cows and  
 sheep,these days some farmers wives   
 breed dogs to make extra money.Some   
 farms also have taken in paying guests
 during the summer months. .           </content>
