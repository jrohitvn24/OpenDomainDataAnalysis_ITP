{Hunting}:This is not encouraged on the
 large estate.The terrain is unsuitable
 as there are so many wide ditches and 
 barbed wire is used extensively.The   
{local hunt}ride on the Eastern hill   
 area.{Otter hunting}has taken place in
 living memory.The group was not local 
 (possibly from Lancashire)Men and     
 women in blue livery and carrying     
 staffs took part,hunting on           
 foot.{Shooting:One estate has a       
 gamekeeper and organises shoots of    
 pheasants and wild duck.Eight guns are
 allowed,and those taking part         
 currently pay Â£11.50 per bird for     
 pheasants.There are also duck         
 shoots,mallard,teal and a few         
 shoveler ducks.This year 600 mallard  
 were reared.
