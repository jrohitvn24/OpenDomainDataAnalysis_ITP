  During the academic year 1984-5      
 a completely fresh attempt has been   
 undertaken to revive the student made 
 newspaper at Atlantic College.The     
 editorial committee headed by Colin   
 Jenkin,the deputy headmaster,decided  
 to mark the rebirth by a change of    
 name.Not FOGHORN as previous but now  
 as KLAXON.This is a very suitable name
 since the college's rescue service    
 relies on the sound of the klaxon.    
  The students like their newspaper    
 very much.All 360 students have       
 subscribed to the first five issues.  
 The circulation of 500 allows for     
 copies to be sent to all five sister  
 colleges.A large share of the coverage
 of KLAXON is dedicated to report on   
 the United World Colleges.It is hoped 
 that the newspaper will help build    
 ties with the other colleges.         </content>
