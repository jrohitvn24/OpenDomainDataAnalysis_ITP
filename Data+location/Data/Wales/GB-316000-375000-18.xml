		<title>18HOLYWELL'S INNER-RING ROAD</title>
		<content> 1985 appears to be Holywell's "year of
 the roads."{An inner-ring road}costing
 Â£1 million was begun in March after   
 many years of debate. Tradespeople    
 felt that trade would be adversely    
 affected; others that the provision of
 the A55 Holywell By-pass would negate 
 the need for this road but Delyn B.C. 
 aim to{regenerate Holywell}as a       
 shopping and tourist centre. The new  
 road runs north of the main shopping  
 area of High St and Tower Gdns which  
 will be{pedestrianised.}The twin      
 hazards of Cross St and Victoria Sq at
 either end of the High St will be     
 overcome. Work by the contractors,    
 (McFadden's), has resulted in the     
 demolition of old property, (eg. Bank 
 Place) and the collapse of old sewers.
 Car parking has also been temporarily 
 reduced. Due to these problems many   
 regard Holywell as a disaster area!   </content>
