   After lunch I take Harry the hamster
 out of his cage and feed and clean    
 him. Then I play out on the yard for  
 half an hour.                         
   Lunchtime ends at 1.20. In the      
 afternoon I normally do work on our   
 novel.  This term we are studying     
 "Danny the champion of the world" by  
 Roald Dahl. This work often takes all 
 afternoon.                            
   When I get home at 4 o'clock I watch
 television and have tea. I go upstairs
 and get ready for Brownies. This      
 starts at 5.30 and finishes at 7p.m. I
 go by car.                            
  when I get home from Brownies I get  
 ready for bed. My mum comes into my   
 bedroom and we talk about the day for 
 ten minutes and then I go to sleep.   </content>
