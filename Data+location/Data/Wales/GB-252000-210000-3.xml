		<title>03Work in the Coal Industry</title>
		<content> The majority of the men who live in   
 Tumble and the surrounding area still 
 work in the coal industry. They dig   
 for Anthracite Coal which is the best 
 source of energy in the world. The    
 mining operations are carried out at  
 Cynheidre Colliery which is approx.   
 12Km. from Tumble and at a private    
 coal mine about 1Km. from the centre  
 of the village. Cynheidre is the only 
 surviving mine left in the Gwendraeth 
 Valley.                               
 The men travel to Cynheidre by private
 cars and buses or by N.C.B. transport.
 There are 3 work shifts, night, day   
 and the afternoon shift. They go to   
 work dressed in clean clothes. On     
 arriving at the colliery they change  
 into their working clothes in the pit 
 head baths. Before going underground  
 they are issued with a safety helmet  
 and a lamp.                           </content>
