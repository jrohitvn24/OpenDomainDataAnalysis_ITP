		<content> Every year in Cribyn children go out  
 to collect{Calennig.Calennig}is       
 when people give you money when the   
 New Year comes in.                    
 At night you go round{Blacko.Blacko}is
 when you dress in black clothes and   
 put coal dust on your face so the     
 people give you{Calennig}after they   
 have guessed who you are.             
 After you have given them five chances
 to guess and if theydo not know who   
 you are you have to tell them. One    
 year a boy dressed up in women's      
 clothes and everybody thought he was a
 girl so they named girl's names       
 instead of boy's names.               
 Every year you collect about Â£3 to Â£6.
 Peaple usually give 10p to 20p. the   
 most I've collected is Â£4.60. Some    
 parents don't like their children go  
 round Blacko because they think it    
 cheeky to ask for money.              </content>
