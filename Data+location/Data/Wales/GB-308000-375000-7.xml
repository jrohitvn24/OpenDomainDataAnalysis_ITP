 Cars are considered to be a vital form
 of transport in the block. There is no
 bus service of any kind and people    
 who do not own a car have to rely     
 heavily on neighbours, friends or     
 relations to take them to shops,      
 Doctors, or any other appointments    
 they may have. Children have to be    
 transported to School by their parents
 which involves a round trip of 10     
 miles approximately. Cars are of      
 course vital to the few inhabitants of
 the area who travel to work outside   
 the district, without transport their 
 employment prospects would be nil,    
 except in the very few circumstances  
 where their employers would make      
 the arrangements to have them         
 picked up each day.
