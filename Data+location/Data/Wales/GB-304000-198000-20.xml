		<title>20ORIGIN OF MT.ASH'S NAME</title>
		<content> The origin of Mountain Ash's name is  
 due to the simple fact that a large   
 rowan tree(mountain ash)was situated  
 near a ford that crossed the River    
 Cynon where the Mountain Ash Inn      
 stands today.                         
                                       
 It was the bride of a predecessor of  
 the Lord Aberdare Family who held the 
 leaf of a rowan tree in her hand and  
 requested that the inn that was being 
 built should take the name of the     
 rowan or mountain ash.                
                                       
 It was called the Mountain Ash Inn and
 the hamlet which grew around it became
 a village and eventually a town and   
 all were known as Mountain Ash.       
 Some people preferred the Welsh names 
 Y Gerddin or Aberpennar(meaning mouth 
 of the Pennar Brook)but Mountain Ash  
 is the name that has remained.        </content>
