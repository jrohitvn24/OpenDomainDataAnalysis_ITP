		<title>03Social Concern BARRAGE</title>
		<content>  The Severn estuary has the second    
 fastest tidal range in the world, that
 is why it is one of the best spots for
 a tidal barrage to be built. It is to 
 be based between Cardiff and Weston   
 Super Mare.                           
  Green Peace,a conservation group,and 
 the people who live near the site are 
 against having the barrage for a      
 number of reasons. Green Peace are    
 against it because the birds stopping 
 on the mudflats will lose their       
 feeding grounds.The people are against
 it because the farmers will have to   
 spend more money on drainage and that 
 will mean they will lose farmland and 
 also affect the marshland nature      
 reserve in Magor.                     
  The Government are in favour of it   
 because it will provide lots of work  
 and will generate electricity without 
 using nuclear power.                  </content>
