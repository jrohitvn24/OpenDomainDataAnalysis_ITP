		<content> The opening day in the old school was 
 on Monday,2nd,September,1878.The      
 first two children in the admission   
 book were the headmaster's            
 children.Our last day in the old      
 school was on Friday,22nd,March,1985. 
 We had 3 extra days holiday.This      
 gave the teachers time to sort moving 
 everything across to the new school.  
 The new school opened on Monday,15th, 
 April,1985.The old school had wooden  
 block floors.The new school has       
 carpets on the floor.The old school   
 was bigger than the new one.The       
 ceilings in the old school were a lot

 heating.The new school has gas fired  
 central heating.The windows in the new
 school are a lot lower than in the old
