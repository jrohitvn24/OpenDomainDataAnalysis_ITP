		<title>13Farming in Rhos</title>
		<content> The main type of farming is dairy     
 farming,but other types of agriculture
 are also carried out.For example,hay  
 is grown by several farmers for winter
 feed;winter barley is also grown from 
 which dairy cake is produced;potatoes 
 are also grown for sale in local      
 markets;chickens are kept by many     
 farmers for free range eggs;and pigs  
 are kept for meat production.         
  Dairy farming is the most important  
 type of agricultural activity.The     
 dairy farmer generally starts work at 
 6.30 a.m. and finishes about 6.30 p.m.
 In one farm in this area,Edisbury     
 Grange,there are 160 cows kept for    
 milk production,25 cows that are in   
 calf at the moment and 2 bulls.Each   
 cow is milked twice a day by an       
 automatic milking machine.The milk is 
 then cooled and left in a bulk storage
 tank to await collection by road      </content>
