		<title>13New Arrivals from Hong Kong.</title>
		<content>      In 1983 the village of Crynant   
 welcomed into its heart a family that 
 had originally arrived in Britain from
 Hong Kong. The two daughters in the   
 family, Sonia (Hau Wing Yan) and      
 Belinda (Hau Wing Yin) were both born 
 in the Kwong Wai Hospital in Hong     
 Kong. The children went to school     
 there and lived with their grandmother
 while their parents travelled to      
 Britain to start a business.          
      At the ages of 6 and 4           
 respectively, the children and their  
 parents were reunited and moved to    
 Bristol where their father owned a    
 fish and chip shop called 'Sunny's'.  
 Three years later they moved to       
 Crynant and proved to be an asset both
 to the community, in the form of their
 fish and chip shop, and to the        
 Creunant Primary School where they    
 have been happy and diligent pupils.  </content>
