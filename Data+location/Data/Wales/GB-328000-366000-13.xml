		<title>13Leisure Activities</title>
		<content> Very many leisure activities are more 
 individually based than clubs or      
 organisation orientated, and a list of
 these activities is a very long one   
 ,both for adults and children. One    
 sample survey produced 37 different   
 types of leisure activity for children
 and 55 for adults.Many of these can be
 done individually or in pairs.        
{Pets }Many hours are taken up by pet  
 care. A survey in one street showed   
 that most homes have pets and though  
 some animals are common there is an   
 enormous variety. e.g. hens kept for  
 economic reasons. More active pastimes
 include: Karate " I go every Sunday   
 from 1030 to 1230hrs &amp; have 7 belts"  
 (boy age10) Dancing "Every Thursday I 
 go to ballet and have reached grade 3"
 (girl age9) Roller skating "I get up  
 at 0500 on Saturdays and go roller    
 skating "(Girl age10)                 </content>
