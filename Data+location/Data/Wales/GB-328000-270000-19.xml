		<content>     Knighton is the centre of an      
 agricultural community with a sheep   
 and cattle market.Sheep and cattle are
 sold on Thursdays and sometimes there 
 are special markets on Fridays.Before 
 sheep are sold they are weighed and   
 graded by the official Grader so that 
 the subsidies can be worked out. The  
 auctioneer then sells pens of sheep,  
 He accepts bids and sells to the      
 highest bidder.The breeds of sheep    
 sold are Clun Forest,Kerrys,and       
 Suffolks . The auctioneer in Knighton 
 is McCartneys and they also have      
 furniture and house sales.Knighton    
 Market is the main market for Wales   
 and the West Country.Its headage      
 through-put is second only to Banbury 
 in England and it is the largest stock
 market in Wales.
