		<content> My father goes to work at 6.30 a.m.   
 gets home at 1.00 p.m., has dinner    
 then goes to bed until 5.00 p.m. Later
 he visits my nan. At about 7.00 p.m.  
 he comes home, has supper then watches
 T.V. before going to bed.             
 My mother gets up at 10.00 a.m.,      
 prepares dinner, goes shopping then   
 cooks the dinner. After dinner she    
 does her washing and housework        
 sometimes she makes tart for tea.     
 After tea she sometimes goes down the 
 garden. Later she has a bath, watches 
 T.V. then goes to bed.                
 I get up at 9.00 a.m. and my sister an
 hour or so later. We play until dinner
 time or watch T.V. and do the same    
 after dinner until tea. Later we have 
 supper, bath, watch T.V. for a hour   
 or so then go to bed.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
