           ****************            
                                       
 Gayton Hall Farm, which up until      
 recent years was over 200 acres, has  
 now been reduced to a mere 60 acres as
 a result of land being sold for the   
 golf course. This however is not the  
 only change to have occurred. From    
 having large flocks of sheep and herds
 of cows the farm has since been used  
 for market gardening.                 
    Everything about the farm now is   
 geared towards selling. All types of  
 crops are grown which are suitable    
 for marketing including barley which  
 is used as part of the crop rotation  
 programme. Four people work the farm  
 which comparing its size is a large   
 ratio.
