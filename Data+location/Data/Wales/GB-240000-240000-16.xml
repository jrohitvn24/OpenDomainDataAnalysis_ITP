		<title>16OUR OWN STUDIO</title>
		<content>{OUR OWN STUDIO _}This enterprise was  
 started in{1980}by a local art teacher
 and his wife. The aim was to introduce
 the local community to the various    
 forms of artistic experience and      
 activities. Twelve interested         
 volunteers organise{exhibitions,      
{theatre visits}and{"workshops".}The   
 bilingual "workshops" actively involve
 local children in plays or dramatic   
 experiences.                          
 An old chapel vestry was the first    
 site for the studio, but it is now    
 housed in a recently purchased and    
 repaired building.                    
{Money}for the project comes from      
{District and County Council funds,    
{grants}from various Art Associations  
 and {fund raising activities}organised
 by the studio. Membership is free. The
 Studio holds the{Llandysul Festival-}a
 weekend of different cultural events. </content>
