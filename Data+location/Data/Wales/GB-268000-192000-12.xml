 The other major industry in the area  
 is Ford Motor Company. Set up in the  
 1960's, it is mainly responsible for  
 supplying axles, transmissions and    
 other components to other works in the
 Ford network within Britain and       
 Europe. The works stretch along the   
 main road (Fabian's Way) which leads  
 out of Swansea.                       
 Two major works have closed down      
 within the last ten years with a      
 resultant loss of jobs for people who 
 live in Port Tennant: Tir John Power  
 Station and United Carbon Black. Both 
 were causes of pollution in the area, 
 especially the latter, and their      
 closure was viewed with mixed         
 feelings. The sites of both have now  
 been cleared and plans are prepared to
 use them for leisure activities.      </content>
