 "Pieces of Eight."There are seven     
 children in the group and the leader

 piano and he sings.Everyone in the    
 group sings.In addition I play the    
 cello,Ainsley plays the chime         
 bars,Anna and Karen play the recorders
 and Alice and Nicola play the         
 violins.Bryony played the recorder but
 she has moved away so Linda will be   
 taking her place.                     
    We have practices every Friday at  
 quarter past four.We practice         
 different pieces of music for about   
 two hours.While some of us are playing
 the verse,the others play the chorus. 
     We are invited to sing at clubs   
 and old peoples homes. Each           
 performance consists of about twelve  
 pieces of music.
