		<content> St. Michael's Parish Church is a      
 building of historic interest,        
 originally called St. Elbod after the 
 Bishop of Bangor who in 755 A.D. gave 
 land on the bank of the river Gele to 
 the Church.  The present Norman       
 structure dates from the 13th century 
 when it was rededicated to St.Michael.
 The old vicarage near the Church has  
 been sold his year and has become an  
 old people's home.  The new vicarage  
 is situated at the other end of town  
 in Rhuddlan Road.  The present Vicar  
 is Rev. D. J. Roberts B.Sc.  He has a 
 wife Bethan and 3 children.           
 It is a bilingual Church and has 2    
 choirs, a Welsh choir with 12 members 
 and an English choir with 20 members. 
 About 20 children attend the Sunday   
 School.  There is an English morning  
 service at 11.00 am and a Welsh       
 Service at 6.30 pm.                   </content>
