		<title>15Farming</title>
		<content> The average size farm in this area is 
 about 250 acres.Hill-farming is the   
 best description,concentrating on the 
 rearing of sheep and cattle for the   
 fatstock market.In the recent past,the
 farmers in the area have relied       
 heavily on E.E.C. subsidies which have
 helped to maintain a way of life      
 traditional to Radnor.                
  Apart from the farmhouse,there would 
 normally be a hay barn,sillage pit,   
 outbuildings for machinery,cattle     
 and lambing sheds and a sheep dip.On  
 most farms a hay crop would be grown  
 and perhaps oats and barley for       
 sillaging.Straw would be bought in.   
 Since the war,increasing mechanisation
 has meant fewer workers on the land so
 that it is now possible for two men to
 look after a farm of this size with   
 relative ease except during haymaking.
