		<title>18Children's Pets - Sealand</title>
		<content> Most children in our class have pets  
 just a few don't.The most common pets 
 are dogs and cats.Dogs need lots of   
 exercise especialy big dogs, who need 
 to be taken for walks nearly every    
 day,but cats can be left out all day  
 and they'll come when they want.      
 Reptiles,amphibions and mammals are   
 all animals some can be pets,some are 
 unusual and some are common.Budgies,  
 goldfish,rabbits,dogs,cats and        
 tortoises are common, snakes, lizards 
 and tarantulas are unusual.You        
 couldn't keep a dog or a cat in a flat
 because they have no room for         
 exercise, but you could keep small    
 pets like budgies, mice, gerbils,     
 snakes, lizards, or goldfish. Dogs, I 
 think, are the easiest pets to keep,  
 all they need is exercise, food, drink
 and care, but if you don't care for   
 them they will die like other animals.</content>
