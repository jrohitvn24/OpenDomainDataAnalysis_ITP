		<title>01PAINSCASTLE - HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Painscastle is a typical Welsh border
 village. Historically it was so       
 positioned for two reasons. Firstly it
 was the head of the Lower Elfael      
 commote till the Norman Conquest. In  
 1231 the castle, of Norman origin, was
 constructed at the request of King    
 Henry III for the Fitzpayn family to  
 strengthen and control the border. The
 village has an interesting peculiarity
 in that its farms are nucleared       
 so that lands radiate from farmhouses 
 built under the castle 'shelter'.     
  In the 17th century Painscasle found 
 importance as a place on the drovers  
 routes - the cattle being driven from 
 mid Wales, across the Wye at Erwood,  
 through Painscastle en route to       
 London. Until this century the Petty  
 Sessions for the area were held in the
 village and it is still the centre for
 the Rural District council.           </content>
