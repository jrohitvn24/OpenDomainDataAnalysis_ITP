		<content> Many small farms have been bought out 
 by big farms.In Presteigne when you   
 walked down the street you would have 
 known everyone-there are lots of      
 strangers now.Farming is more         
 mechanized and there is more stock per
 acre.The roads have been improved and 
 there is much more traffic.The farms  
 have more tractors and machinery and  
 less people work on the land. The     
 schools have become comprehensive and 
 much bigger.Mains water has come to   
 many houses.More stock is wintered    
 indoors -stock is not so hardy.Very   
 few people at the churches,village    
 schools have closed round here.Public 
 transport has almost ceased.Deliveries
 of bread and grocery in these parts   
 has stopped almost completely.In l962 
 we had electricity for the first time 
 and then the phone in l980 (-several  
 examples of this last sentence)       </content>
