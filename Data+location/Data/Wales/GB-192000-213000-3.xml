		<content>   The Mart ground in haverfordwest is 
 in Perrots Road. It is open on        
 Tuesdays for the sale of farmer's     
 Stock. The sales are conducted by the 
 owning auctioneers Basil Jones and    
 Son. There are three main sale rings, 
 one for beef stores another for dairy 
 cows and the third and most used is   
 for calves. Figures for sales are     
 approximately: calves 20 to 25000 per 
 year with a peak of 750 in one day    
 usually in January, reflecting the    
 calving patterns of the large local   
 dairy farming community. Beef stores  
 number 10 to 11000 and cows about 1750
 per year.                             
    On the mart ground there are also  
 many trade stands selling a variety of
 things of interest to farmers from    
 machinery to clothing.
