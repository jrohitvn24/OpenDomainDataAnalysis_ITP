		<title>03HOLY TRINITY CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The moment when it was decided to   
 build a new church is unclear.That it 
 was built with the dedication and     
 affection of many local christians,   
 there is no doubt.Tothe gifts of local
 families like the Middleton Evans and 
 the Green Prices were added the       
 subscriptions of many visitors to the 
 town.At the opening of the new church 
 on Wednesday,26th July,1871,the local 
 paper listed the very considerable    
 sums given by visitors_Â£300 from the  
 Pump House,Â£125 from the Rock House   
 and Â£40 from the Llanerch.The cost of 
 erection was Â£2,457 _an amount, which 
 may make us all smile in these        
 inflation_ridden days,with which the  
 architect_Tom Nicholson of Hereford   
 was to design a building in the 'Early
 Decorated' style capable of seating   
 500 people.
