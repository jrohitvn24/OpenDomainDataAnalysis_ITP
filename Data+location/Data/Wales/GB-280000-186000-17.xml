		<content> Early in 1985, West Glamorgan County  
 Council gave the go ahead for a new   
 Â£850,000 road improvement scheme for  
 the planned Â£78 million drift mine.   
 Annual production is estimated at     
 700,000 tons with 635 jobs created    
 during construction and eventually 700
 mining jobs.                          
 Drilling and seismic surveys for the  
 proposed mine have been undertaken for
 a number of years on the local hills. 
 In April 1985 the go ahead was given  
 for an exploratory borehole on Moel   
 Ton Mawr in connection with the mine. 
 The borehole was to be dug to a depth 
 of 1000 metres to establish the       
 precise level of the seam where the   
 Margam mine drifts were believed to   
 intersect.  Local councils still wait 
 for a decision from the National Coal 
 Board, amid speculation that it has   
 been scrapped.                        </content>
