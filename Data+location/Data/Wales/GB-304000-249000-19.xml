		<title>19BUILTH'S FAMOUS STATUE</title>
		<content> The latest statue to be erected in    
 Builth is of a Greek god in memory    
 of T.Harri Jones,a famous Welsh poet. 
 The statue has been the centre of     
 ridicule for the townspeople of Builth
 because it is a nude figure. It has   
 recently had its private parts cut off
 and other parts cut off here and      
 there.It has also been daubed with a  
 tarry black paint which will not come 
 off.                                  
 The statue was unveiled about 3 months
 ago and B.B.C. radio and television   
 crews were present to record the      
 occasion.                             
 Harri Jones was born at Cwmcrogau in  
 Llanafan. He attended Builth High     
 School and afterwards emigrated to    
 Australia where he was tragically     
 drowned in an accident. My grandfather
 knew him and says he was a "loner"    
 with not many friends.{(CONTINUED)    </content>
