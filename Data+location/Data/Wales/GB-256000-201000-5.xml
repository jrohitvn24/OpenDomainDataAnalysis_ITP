		<title>05Employment in Llangennech</title>
		<content> By now{Llangennech}has lost its place 
 as one of the busiest of the small    
 industrial villages of Wales. Until   
 recently there were two industries of 
 great importance and value to the     
 community, the NCB Morlais Colliery   
 and The Royal Naval Stores Depot. Both
 provided employment for a large       
 percentage of the village.            
 By now the colliery has closed and the
 whole site is in the process of being 
 cleared, and it appears according to  
 Government statements that the RN     
 Stores Depot will also close in the   
 near future.                          
 There has been an increase lately in  
 the private sector building industry, 
 and four new housing estates have or  
 are being built within the village    
 boundary.                             
 The majority of the village working   
 population travels to Llanelli.       </content>
