		<content>   When asked about their hopes and    
 fears for the future,people invariably
 mentioned the threat of{nuclear war   
 and{unemployment.}However, over-riding
 these fears was the overwhelming      
 concern for the plight of the{starving
{people of Ethiopia.}Media coverage    
 motivated local children to hold fund 
 raising events like{sponsored fasts.  
 People were inspired to greater       
 efforts when{'Band Aid'}conceived and 
 organised by{Bob Geldof}made a No. 1  
 record donating all the proceeds to   
 Ethiopia.Helped by the BBC he followed
 this by turning the world into a      
{Global Juke box}with top pop stars    
 providing a World wide non stop 10hour
 show which raised over{Â£40 million.   
 Local people were present at a similar
 National event at the{Eisteddfod      
 called{'Arian Byw'}and many pledged   
 donations via phone and banks.        </content>
