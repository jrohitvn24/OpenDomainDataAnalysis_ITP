		<content> Abergele is situated on the river gele
 on the coastal plain, at the foot of  
 the limestone upland which forms the  
 western slope of the Vale of Clwyd.   
 This was a position favoured for      
 centuries by travellers being the     
 easiest route from the industrial     
 populated areas to the east.  Abergele
 is one of the oldest settlements in   
 the area, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay and        
 Llandudno being relatively modern.    
 For centuries the limestone hills have
 attracted settlers, fresh water being 
 readily  accessible along a spring    
 line and caves formed through water   
 errotion provided habitation.         
 In 755 AD Elfod Bishop of Bangor      
 granted a piece of land on the banks  
 of the river Gele to build a church.  
 This Church became the nucleus of the 
 settlement.                           
                                       </content>
