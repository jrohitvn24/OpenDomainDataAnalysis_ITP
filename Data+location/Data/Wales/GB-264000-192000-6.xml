 By the beginning of the 20th century, 
 many of the industries had closed down
 because the supplies of iron ore from 
 Devon and Cornwall were declining.    
{Large numbers of sites became derelict
{and buildings fell down.  At this time
{Hafod was called Vivianton or         
{Vivians town after the copper works   
{owners, although Hafod is a Welsh name
{meaning 'summer place'.}Most of the   
 streets in Hafod are named after men  
 who built factories.  Vernon Street is
 named after George Vernon of Briton   
 Ferry, Earl Street after William      
 Villiers and Odo Street after Odo     
 Richard.  The Vivians built the school
 and St.Johns church.  Hafod exists    
 today solely as a result of the copper
 industry.
