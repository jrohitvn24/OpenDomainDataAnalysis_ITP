   We always have an eisteddfod at     
 Llangeitho school on{March 1st}which  
 is {St. David's}Day.We have two       
 teams,Gwynfil and{Ceitho}and we elect 
 a boy and a girl to captain each      
 team.On that day we come to school in 
 Welsh costume. We invite someone to be
 adjudicator.                          
   We practise very hard.There are     
 competitions for singing,playing      
 musical instruments,recitation and    
 also for written work and art.The two 
 teams sit on opposite sides of the    
 hall.We are excited.Some of us are    
 nervous when we perform but we do our 
 best as we are anxious to score points
 for our team.The{stories,handwriting  
{and paintings}are displayed in the    
 school.Our parents are invited to see 
 them and also to a{concert}to hear the
 prizewinners.                         </content>
