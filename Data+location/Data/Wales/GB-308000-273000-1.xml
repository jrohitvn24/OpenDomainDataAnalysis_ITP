		<title>01LLANBISTER GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content>    A beautiful area of rounded hills  
 varying in height between 900 and 1400
 feet, with trees and hedges giving a  
 park like appearence. The river Ithon 
 meanders with the A483 following its  
 course. Nearly all farmland or common 
 except for the small village of       
 Llanbister. Wild flowers and birds in 
 plenty.                               
    Some 54 men, 47 women and 22       
 children live in the area, mainly     
 native Welsh but essentially English  
 speaking. Main occupation farming but 
 many trades.                          
    Sports Day is the main event of the
 year with whist drives in the winter. 
 The village shop and church hall are  
 the social centres. There are three   
 churches. The "Radnor" friendliness   
 pervades and fund raising is easy.The 
 community spirit is very strong. There
 is a primary school.                  </content>
