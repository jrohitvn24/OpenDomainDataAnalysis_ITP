		<title>13ENTERTAINMENT IN LLANBISTER</title>
		<content>    The lack of cinemas and theatres   
 and the poor quality T.V. reception   
 has encouraged the continuation of    
 alternative entertainment. This       
 usually takes the form of a group     
 activity or sport. During the winter  
 months most groups hold their annual  
 dinner in hotels. These are usually   
 followed by a dance or games. A       
 charity dinner dance is organised by  
 ladies from the village.Whist drives  
 are popular with players traveling    
 great distances to play. Hunting is   
 also a winter activity.               
   Sports include Rounders, Darts and  
 Dominoes played in leagues.Tug o War, 
 an international sport.Car treasure   
 hunts, Clay Pigeon shooting, Pony     
 trotting run through the summer. A    
 recent innovation is the twice weekly 
 visit by the video hire van.The       
 library van calls once a fortnight.   </content>
