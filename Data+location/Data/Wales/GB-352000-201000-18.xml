		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ANNE</title>
		<content>  I got up at 8.00a.m. And got into my 
 dungarees and jumper. My breakfast of 
 shreddies,toast and peanut butter with
 a drink of blackcurrant juice was     
 ready. After breakfast I fed the      
 chickens then I made ginger fairling  
 biscuits. I played with my Lego and I 
 drew horses with my sister Claire.    
 Later,I went outside to watch dad at  
 work and talked to our goat called    
 'Pookie snack n' Burger'.Claire and I 
 went for a walk and then went to see  
 the rabbits before our lunch of beans 
 on toast and cakes. After lunch I     
 planted some calendula flowers and    
 then we played badminton.It was soon  
 tea-time we had 'shepherds'pie then   
 cherries with yogurt and coca-cola.We 
 watched the Eurovision Song contest on
 television and went to bed at 10.30p.m
 which was late for me!  Anne Deeming.
