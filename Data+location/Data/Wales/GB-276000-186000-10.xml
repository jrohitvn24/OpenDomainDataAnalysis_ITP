		<title>10YOUTH CLUBS</title>
		<content>      There are basically 2 youth clubs
 actually in the area. However there   
 are others outside that can be used.  
      The two in the area are situated 
 within the town sections,ie. MARGAM   
 YOUTH CLUB and TAIBACH YOUTH CLUB.    
 They offer a wide variety of pastimes 
 and have a fairly modest following.   
 Several times throughout the year they
 hold disco's that can be attended by  
 non-members. Such events are necessary
 for the financial upkeep of the clubs.
      Besides these there are also the 
 normal cubs,scouts and guide groups   
 also Boy's Brigade, athletics and a   
 cycling club.
