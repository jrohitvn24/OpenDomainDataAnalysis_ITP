		<title>13WHAT'S ON? WHERE IS IT?</title>
		<content> The village life still revolves round 
 the school, churches, the village hall
 and the new Leisure Centre.The Red    
 Dragon Hall was built in 1964; the new
 modern building replacing the old,    
 wooden ex-army hut which came to      
 Velindre soon after the First World   
 War.The local community derived such a
 lot of culture and amusement from the 
 old building and the new modern       
 complex carries on the same tradition.
 It is the meeting place of the        
 village.The Women's Institute and     
 Merched y Wawr meet monthly,the       
 doctor's surgery is in use weekly, a  
 babies' clinic is held monthly and    
 various committees meet regularly.The 
 Snooker Tables attract the young and  
 old from the village and surrounding  
 districts.Bazaars, Coffee Evenings,   
 concerts and dramas are held to raise 
 funds for local charities.{M.DAVIES.  </content>
