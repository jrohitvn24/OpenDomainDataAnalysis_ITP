		<title>01THE AREA AROUND TONYPANDY</title>
		<content>   The population of the area is       
 approximately 10,000 spread throughout
 several small towns and villages:     
 Gelli, Bodringallt, Ystrad,           
 Pontrhondda,Trealaw, Llwynypia,       
 Blaenclydach, Cwmclydach and          
 Tonypandy.  The main town is          
 Tonypandy,famous for its prominent    
 past in formulating the industrial and
 political life of the Rhondda and is  
 the hub of Rhondda's varied and       
 numerous activities.                  
   Coal no longer dominates the        
 landscape or employment, there is not 
 a single coalmine left in the area.   
 Unemployment runs at a high level and 
 very few new factories have come to   
 the area.                             
   Most of the people live in neat rows
 of terraced houses clinging to the    
 steep valley side.  Welsh is no longer
 the dominant language.                </content>
