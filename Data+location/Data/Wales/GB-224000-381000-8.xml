 There are no large fishing vessels in 
 the port of Holyhead.The trawlers     
 arenot much larger than 20metres in   
 length and are mainly concerned with  
 inshore fishing.Most of the ships are 
 owned by asyndicate or are a family   
 concern.All the vessels have modern   
 equipment,such as radar,radios,winches
 and power pulleys.                    
 Recently the trawler owners have felt 
 aggrieved in that they have now to pay
 harbour fees.This matter has yet to be
 resolved asif the fees are too high   
 then some of the fishermen could be   
 driven out of business.
