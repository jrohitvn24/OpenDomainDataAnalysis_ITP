		<title>08Past Industry, Wye Valley.</title>
		<content>    In this area industry in the past  
 depended on the water power provided  
 by White Brook and Manor Brook.       
 Several mills were built to harness   
 the energy of the water. The type of  
 industry which evolved included wire  
 making, paper making and grinding     
 corn. The other main industry was     
 farming.                              
    In the Whitebrook Valley there were
 a corn mill, some wire works and paper
 mills. The wire made here was used to 
 make pins, nails, needles, chains,    
 fish hooks and sheep combing cards.   
 Wire making began around 1568 and     
 continued until 1880.                 
    There were 5 paper mills in        
 Whitebrook; production started in     
 1760. The buildings of Fernside Mill  
 still remain intact, and some of the  
 old mills have been renovated into    
 luxury accommodation.                 </content>
