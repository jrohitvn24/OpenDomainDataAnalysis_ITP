		<title>17BETTY BLANDINO-COIL POTTERY</title>
		<content>   Mrs.Blandino is a professional      
 potter,she makes very delicate coil   
 pots.She has exhibitions in several   
 permanent collections in Britain and  
 abroad.Mrs.Blandino has just come back
 from Germany where she visited an     
 exhibition where some of her pots were
 on display.                           
     Mrs Blandino began to make coil   
 pots in 1973.Her favourite types of   
 pots are irregular ones.She takes 3_4 
 days to make a pot.Many of her pots   
 &lt;because they are so thin>  change    
 shapes in the kiln ,they look weird   
 but interesting.She doesn't often sell
 them from her home.However if people  
 enquire she will make pots of their   
 choice Mrs Blandino has written a book
 about Coiled pottery.When we visited  
 her she showed us how to make a coiled
 pot.The Princess of Wales asked her a-
 bout her work at Painswick Craft Fair.</content>
