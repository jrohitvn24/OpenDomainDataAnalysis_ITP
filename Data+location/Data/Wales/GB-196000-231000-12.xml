		<title>12THE FUTURE OF THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>                                       
 AS FAR AS THE FARMING IS CONCERNED, IT
 IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE FUTURE WILL 
 REMAIN AS CONSTANT AS THE PAST IN     
 THAT                                  
 IT WILL BE THE MAIN ACTIVITY OR USE OF
 LAND.                                 
 IF BARHAM ROAD AND HILL ROAD ARE      
 DEMOLISHED,  THEN THE VILLAGE WILL BE 
 HALVED AND VIRTUALLY CEASE TO BE A    
 VIABLE ENTITY. THIS BECAUSE SUCH      
 CLOSURE WOULD CERTAINLY MEAN THE END  
 OF THE SCHOOL, AND THE CHILDREN WOULD 
 BE BUSSED TO ABERGWAUN.               
 IF THE DEPOT DOES EXPAND, THEN MOST   
 OF THE LAND FRON THE MAIN GATES TO    
 LLANYCHAER WILL FENCED OFF. THEN THE  
 SCHHOOL, SCHOOL HOUSE, SCHOOL COTTAGE 
 WILL UNDOUBEDTLY BE DEMOLISHED, AS WAS
 THE MANSION, - THIS AT THE HANDS OF   
 THE PHILISTINE M.O.D. THE FUTURE IS   
 BLEAK FOR TRECWN.                     </content>
