		<content> The shops in Cimla are situated in    
 areas where most people live . There  
 are 2  newsagents which sell sweets,  
 cigarettes, tobacco, soft drinks and  
 newspapers . People use them daily .  
 There are 3 grocers which sell fresh  
 and frozen food, fruit and vegetables,
 dairy produce and bread.People use    
 these shops because they are  so      
 convenient for items forgotten on     
 shopping trips to town.People find    
 these shops much more expensive.They  
 do their main shopping in the large   
 supermarkets in Neath and Swansea.    
 There are 2 post-offices which are    
 used regularly by most people,        
 especially by senior citizens who can 
 collect their pensions there.The only 
 "fish and chip" shop is always busy. A

 the small shopping centre in Castle
