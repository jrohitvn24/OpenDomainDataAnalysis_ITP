		<title>14SAINT BARNABAS CHURCH</title>
		<content> Saint Barnabas Church at Velindre is  
 dedicated to Saint Barnabas.The church
 is in the middle of the village and   
 next to our school. Barnabas preached 
 about Jesus and went to Antioch to    
 help the Christians who were          
 persecuted there. His name means "son 
 of encouragement". The festival of    
 Saint Barnabas is celebrated on June  
 12th each year and  we always have    
 special sevices on the Sunday before  
 this date.The church was given to the 
 people of Velindre by Lord Cawdor  and
 it was built in 1862. It has many     
 coloured windows and a pipe organ.On  
 the walls there is a plaque           
 commemorating the men who were killed 
 during the First World War. There is  
 also a plaque in memory of a soldier  
 who was killed in the Boer War.Near   
 the entrance is a tile showing Lord   
 Cawdor's Coat of Arms.                </content>
