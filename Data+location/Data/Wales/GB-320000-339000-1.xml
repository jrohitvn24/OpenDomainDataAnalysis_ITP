		<title>01LLANGOLLEN,A TOURIST CENTRE.</title>
		<content> Although only half of the old         
{Market}town of Llangollen is          
 represented in this block,it is still 
 by far the most dominant feature.The  
 land rises quite steeply from the town
 in the north of the block to part of  
 the Berwyn Range of mountains in the  
 south.The{A.5.,}London to Holyhead    
 route, runs along the northerly edge  
 of the block.The majority of the land 
 cover is dominated by farmland with   
 some coniferous woodland.             
      The following pages are mainly   
 concerned with the town area which is 
 steeped in{Local History.}This is     
 reflected in many of the pages.The    
 main theme is that of{Tourism,}where  
 places of interest have been developed
 to that end.This can best be seen on  
 pages 5-11,and14-17.{Farming}and the  
 little{Industry}there is, can be seen 
 on pages 12 and 13.                   </content>
