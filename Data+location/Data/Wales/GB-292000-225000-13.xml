		<content>  I wake up at 7.15 am. I am usually   
 the first one up so I make the morning
 pot of tea. Once I used to make one or
 two cups but now it is three or four. 
 At 8.40 am I set out for work, before 
 I go I buy a paper and drop the       
 children off at school. When I get to 
 Brecon I have to attend a meeting.    
 After the meeting I go to a coffee -  
 shop with a few colleagues. At 12.00  
 noon I get a lift to Craig-y-nos      
 country park where I am a warden. The 
 jobs vary with the weather and season,
 today I showed some children around   
 the grounds, then I mowed the lawns. I
 catch the bus home go for a run and   
 have tea. Shortly after 11.00 pm I go 
 to bed.
