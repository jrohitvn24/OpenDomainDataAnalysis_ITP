		<title>04MEEND FARM,LYDART</title>
		<content> A Gwent County Council smallholding of
 109 acres,the Meend Farm,Lydart,      
 stocks 60 ewes and 100 cattle. Out to 
 pasture from mid April to early       
 November,the cattle are housed during 
 the winter months in covered yards.   
 Although hay normally provides the    
 bulk of winter fodder at The Meend,the
 wet summer of 1985 proved disastrous  
 for haymaking. Many farms turned from 
 hay to big bale silage as a means of  
 salvaging grass crops from wet fields.
 By early September the resultant sharp
 increase in demand for plastic silage 
 bags caused a shortage of supplies in 
 the area. Farm machinery depots       
 experienced a similar rise in demand  
 for new and secondhand round balers   
 and the necessary bale handling       
 equipment. For The Meend,as for many  
 neighbouring farms,1985 has been the  
 year of the big bag !                 </content>
