		<title>20A NOTABLE EVENT, SWANSEA</title>
		<content>   It isn't often that a school is     
 visited by the two most important     
 people in the county at the same time.
 This year the chairman of the school  
 governors  is Chairman of West        
 Glamorgan County Council, while the   
 Lord Mayor of Swansea lives close to  
 the school. Both arrived at the school
 in lovely black cars. Their chains    
 were very impressive and made them    
 look very important. The County Chair-
 man's was made of steel because of the
 important steel works in the area. We 
 soon learned that the two men led busy
 lives during their year in office.    
 They explained that they represented  
 all the people in the county. They    
 must lead a very busy life indeed. All
 too soon the chauffeurs came to remind
 these busy men that it was time to go.
 A few quick goodbyes and two lovely   
 black cars whisked away our visitors. </content>
