 The Winter starts when we have to give
 hay to the animals. We have a small   
 holding with cows, goats and one sheep
 called "Ba Lam" who eats everything   
 even the baby's nappies (my mum goes  
 spare).  We also have 3 horses.       
 My Winter is not very horrible        
 although cold, wet and snowy and its  
 much better than living in a town.

 Our Winter is sometimes very cold and 
 foggy and sometimes we even have snow.
 One Winter we even had snow as high as
 a wall and we used a spade to dig our 
 way out of the house. On January 1st  
 we go around singing in the streets.  
 The younger children sing{"Calennig   
{calonnog. Rhai plant moen un ceiniog"}
 and                                   
 the older ones{"Blwydd newydd dda i   
{chi ac i bawb sydd yn y ty".          </content>
