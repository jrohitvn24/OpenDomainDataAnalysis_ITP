		<content>  Councillor Selwyn Davies joined the  
 Old Borough Council in 1969 and was   
 the last mayor of the Borough before  
 its organization in 1973.             
  Concillor Selwyn has no plans of     
 retirement because he says, "They     
 won't let me out at the moment!" His  
 popularity at Cowbridge Town Hall     
 certainly showed when they threw a    
 surprise party in his honour on Friday
 10th May.From 1941 to 1945 he served  
 in the R.A.F. and he says one  of his 
 proudest moments was when he presented
 the seal of the Borough to R.A.F.     
 St.Athan.                             
  The Councillors present were: D.A.   
 Thomas, J. Jones, A. Rees(present     
 Mayor), K. Gates, J. Hydon, H.Jenkins,
 J. Roberts, Mayoress P. Roberts, Town 
 Clerk M. Frost, S. Golden, Mrs.A.     
 Maitland, Mrs.A. Stone.
