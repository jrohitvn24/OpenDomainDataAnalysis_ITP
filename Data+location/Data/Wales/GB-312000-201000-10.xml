		<content> Our D Block is in the county of Mid   
 Glamorgan in South East Wales.Our     
 location is known as approximatly 320 
 metres above sea leval,but due to     
 higher ground around rising to reach  
 900 metres,this has a marked  effect  
 on our climate.Winter began slighter  
 earlier than the coastal area of South
 Wales,and lasts slightly longer.The   
 winters can be quite wet and snow is  
 common every year,amounts vary from   
 year to year.Due to the slighter      
 longer winter season the growing      
 season is affected.Rainfall an average
 for a year is in the region of 50" or 
 125cm.The natural tree cover is mainly
 deciduous trees and some coniferous   
 forests owned by the Forestry         
 Commission, growth being marked by the
 upland nature of the terrain.
