 Marketing board in Marchwiel,a few    
 miles away,where it is made into      
 cheese.Each cow produces between 251  
 and 451 per day.                      
 During  the warm weather the cows are 
 left in the pastures to graze.The cows
 eat grass supplemented by cow nuts.The
 grass is digested in their four       
 stomachs.Water is available to the    
 cows from their troughs.In winter the 
 cows are kept in a shippon and are    
 then fed on silage,meal and hay.The   
 cows continue to produce milk         
 throughout the winter.                
 The most common breed of cows in this 
 area is Fresian.These are easily      
 recognised by their black and white   
 markings.A few hereford cows are also 
 to be found in this area.
