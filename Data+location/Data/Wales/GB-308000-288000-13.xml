		<content>   {In Newtown quite a lot of teachers 
{have been on strike for more money.   
 In May a lot of my friends and me went
 to Staylittle.This is called          
 Penfforddlas in Welsh.                
    We went canoeing and I was         
 frightened at first but I soon got    
 used to it.On the 20 th of June we had
 sports day.I came third in the flat   
 race,fourth in the obstacle and fourth
 in the egg and spoon.                 
{   Last Saturday was carnival day in  
{Newtown.I was on the Brownie float and
{we dressed up as the Cinderella       
{story.It was great fun.               
    On Tuesday we went on the nature   
 trail;we saw lots of different insects
 and flowers.
