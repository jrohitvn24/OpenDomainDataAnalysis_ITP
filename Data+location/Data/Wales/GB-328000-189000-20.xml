 Here are some of the things we found  
 when we talked about{getting in touch 
{with people.}Another word we can use  
 for getting touch is{communications.} 
     Lots of us have a{television}or{  
{radio.}These things are important     
 because they tell what is happening in
 our world each day.{Newspapers}also   
 give us news.Many of us have{         
{telephones}in our homes too.          
     We have made a graph to show how  
 many of the 59 Top Infants have these 
 things in their homes.                
 57 of us receive news from a newspwper
 59 of us receive news from television.
 58 of us have telephones at home.     
 We also write and receive{letters.    
 If we have to get a message to someone
 quickly we can send a{telegram.}
