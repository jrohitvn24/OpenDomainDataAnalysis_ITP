		<title>15Farming in the Glanaman area</title>
		<content>    Approximately two thirds of the    
 area around Glanaman is given over to 
 agriculture. Much of the land is not  
 of the best quality, therefore sheep  
 farming is predominant, farmers       
 supplementing their own pasture by    
 making use of grazing rights on the   
 nearby Black and Betws Mountains.     
 Crops such as hay may be grown to     
 provide winter feed for the animals.  
    Most farms were established before 
 the development of Glanaman as a      
 mining community, and the underlying  
 coal measures have meant that tracts  
 of farmland have been mined and       
 re-planted in the recent past.        
 Consequently, there is the constant   
 threat that farmers may have sections 
 of their property compulsorarily      
 purchased by the National Coal Board  
 for the development of opencast       
 mining.                               </content>
