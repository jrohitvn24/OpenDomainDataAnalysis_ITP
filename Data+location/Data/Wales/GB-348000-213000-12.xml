		<content>  There are various voluntary groups   
which cater for the young and these    
include:St.John's Ambulance Brigade,The
Red Cross,Scouts,Brownies,Girl Guides  
and various church youth clubs.        
  During term time there is an youth   
club at the leisure centre.The Monday  
club caters for juniors up to 12 years 
of age.There is a snooker table,table  
tennis,television and a tuck shop.On a 
Tuesday some of the local breakdancers 
give instruction.On most Thursdays     
there is a disco for all up to 18 years
of age.To become a member there is a   
subscription of 2 pounds.Although it   
seems a lot,membership entitles one to 
cheaper admission to the Saturday      
disco.                                 
  Trips to Bristol ice rink,Newport    
roller rink and swimming pool are      
popular.The youth club certainly gives 
enjoyment to all those who attend.     </content>
