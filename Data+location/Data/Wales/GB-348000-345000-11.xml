		<title>11LAW AND ORDER CRIME</title>
		<content> In Malpas there is not much crime.    
 What crime there is falls into two    
 catergories:                          
 1. Theft. These are mainly minor      
 burglaries committed by youths.       
 2. Poaching of live stock from the    
 many farms in the area. This is very  
 serious crime as the farmers stand to 
 lose a great deal of money.           
 At Malpas POLICE STATION there are two
 cells in which captured criminals can 
 be locked up. However these are hardly
 ever used and any one who needes to be
 locked up is taken to Chester police  
 sttion.                               
 The poice constables work mainly on   
 the beat and spend very liitle time   
 inside the police station.            
 Constable Evans visits the locl school
 regularly to talk to the children and 
 to get to know them. This is called   
 community policing.                   </content>
