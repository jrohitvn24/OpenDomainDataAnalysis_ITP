		<content>   Two years ago, a new sports stadium 
 was built near the River Tawe. It has 
 a running track and an Astraturf      
 football pitch and many other         
 facilities for track and field events.
 Daley Thompson officially opened the  
 stadium, winning an invitation race.  
                                       
   The stadium attracts thousands of   
 people as spectators and many smaller 
 groups, such as cubs and schools, use 
 its facilities. In the summer, schools
 from the area partake in a competitive
 athletics meeting. In the middle of   
 June, hundreds of cubs play 6-a-side  
 football matches against other packs. 
                                       
   In the school summer holidays,      
 children of all ages are offered the  
 chance of free tuition and supervision
 in a great variety of events.
