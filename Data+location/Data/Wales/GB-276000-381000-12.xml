		<title>12A Llandudno Boy's Day.</title>
		<content>   My name is Anthony and my parents   
 own a hotel in town.  My day goes like
 this. I wake up about 6.45 a.m.to help
 my Mum. After carrying out the cereals
 and marmalade, I make the toast and   
 put it on the tables. Then I have my  
 own breakfast while Mum is grilling   
 the bacon, frying the eggs and putt-  
 ing them in the warm cupboard. Then   
 it's time for me to go to school. When
 I come home for lunch she has cleaned 
 the rooms, made the beds and is still 
 working. After lunch, usually an omel-
 ette, I walk our dog.  When I return  
 after school, Mum is usually resting. 
 When she wakes up it's time to start  
 the evening meal, which is served at 6
 pm. After the evening meal is over and
 everything is cleared up, Mum and Dad 
 go to serve in the bar. I either go on
 my bike or practice the violin.
