		<content> The Rev. J. Thomas of Caerwys who     
 writes the 'Roundabout' articles in   
 the Caerwys Chronicle gave us the     
 following information :-              
    The area is very rich in wildlife  
 and when I retired to Caerwys in 1976.
 I listed 87 different species of birds
 I had seen. The smallest birds in the 
 area being the goldcrest and the      
 firecrest. The largest,the heron      
 attracted to this area by the trout   
 fisheries.Fewer pesticides have been  
 used recently allowing plenty of      
 growth in the hedges and many birds   
 have returned to the district         
 including the yellow hammer and the   
 warblers.A buzzard and a barn owl are 
 presently nesting close by.The most   
 unexpected birds seen were the meadow 
 pipit and the osprey.                 
 There are plenty of foxes and badgers 
 in the district.                      </content>
