		<content>      In Port Talbot there are many    
 Churches and Chapels.There are        
 different beliefs ranging from        
 Christian , Catholic,Methodist,and    
 there are a number of different       
 religions which have no places of     
 worship to goto within our area.      
      There is a ROUND CHAPEL in Margam
 which is said to be the second of it's
 kind in the world,and the only one in 
 Great Britain (this is one of a       
 few buildings of historic             
 interest).The only Catholic Church    
 in Margam is OUR LADY OF MARGAM and is
 one of the most popular Churches and  
 supports many of Margam's population. 
      In general the religious trends  
 are the same as else where in the     
 country, showing a drop in active     
 worship. This is even more dramatic   
 in this area because it was once very 
 religious indeed.                     </content>
