		<content> Most of the places of worship are     
 Nonconformist chapels. There are two  
 churches which are Welsh which are St.
 Davids in the Wyndham and St. Johns in
 Ogmore Vale. Some chapels have closed 
 and one is now a carpet and furniture 
 house and another is a scout and guide
 centre. In my school out of 149       
 children, 25 go to church or chapel   
 regularly and 21 go now and then. My  
 father is Vicar of St. Davids and we  
 live in the Vicarage in Wyndham.      
 About 30 people attend the Sunday     
 services. The Welsh language is now   
 only used regularly in one chapel in  
 Ogmore Vale, that being the Bethlehem 
 Chapel.
