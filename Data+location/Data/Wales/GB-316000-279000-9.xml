		<content>    The Parish of Beguildy is          
 administered by a three-tier system of
 government as well as the national    
 government. The Powys County Council, 
 the Radnor District Council and the   
 Beguildy Community Council all levy   
 part of the rates. Powys County       
 Council is responsible for the        
 maintenance of the highways, health,  
 education and the library service. The
 Radnor District Council looks after   
 council housing, planning and sewage. 
 The Beguildy Community Council makes  
 recommendations and requests to the   
 other two councils. One of the Radnor 
 District Councillors, Councillor W.V.S
 Corbett, lives in Felindre and        
 represents the parish. Beguildy       
 Community Council consists of eleven  
 members drawn from all parts of the   
 parish.
