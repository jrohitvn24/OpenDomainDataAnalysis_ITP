		<content> Young children under five could go to 
 the Methodist Church play school or   
 the Nursery here,or if they wanted to 
 they could stay at home.Then the five 
 to elevens go to Marford School or    
 they could go to Gresford School.     
 Marford School is about 15 years old  
 and has about 250 pupils.There are 8  
 classes (not including the Nursery)and
 8 teachers.                           
 Most of the 11-16 year olds go to     
 Darland,but some go to private schools
 such as the Kings or Queens schools.  
 Darland is in Rossett and over 1000   
 pupils go there.When they leave       
 Darland (16-18)they go to Yale VIth   
 Form College that is in Wrexham(about 
 four miles away).
