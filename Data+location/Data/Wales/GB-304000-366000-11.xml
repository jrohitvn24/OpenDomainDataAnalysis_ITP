		<title>11CAR PARKING IN DENBIGH.</title>
		<content>{Car parking}problems are a regular    
 topic for discussion among local      
 residents,{Clwyd County Council}and   
 the{Denbigh Chamber of Trade.}The     
 increasing volume of traffic entering 
 the town has an adverse effect on     
 custom say the Chamber of Trade.They  
 claim that{motorists}are more likely  
 to use shopping areas where there is  
 easy parking.A count of traffic       
 entering and leaving Denbigh during   
 1 hour on{Friday 12th July}showed that
 645 cars left Denbigh and{771}entered.
 Car parking space exists for approx.  
 500 cars.With the trend to more car   
 ownership it seems that the solution  
 lies in building a single large car   
 park (possibly multi storey) on land  
 as close as possible to the town      
 centre.The most likely area which has 
 been considered is the land presently 
 occupied by the{animal market.        </content>
