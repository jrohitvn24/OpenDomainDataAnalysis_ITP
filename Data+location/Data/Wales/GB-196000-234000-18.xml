		<title>18ESGYRN DEER FARM</title>
		<content> Esgyrn farm is situated in an area    
 which has changed very little over the
 years.This farm is not what one would 
 expect to find in such an area.       
 From a run down mixed farm it has been
 converted into a successful deer      
 farm.The farm,which is 200 acres and  
 it is stocked by 260 head of deer.Of  
 these 140 are at present breeding     
 hinds. The family run farm was        
 developed at Esgyrn in 1981 after a   
 similar venture at Ramsey Island.They 
 began by killing deer themselves and  
 serving local high class restaurants  
 to order.Today all the stock is       
 exported abroad to an ever expanding  
 market.Over 50 farmers have set up the
 British Deer Producers Association    
 to assist in such export ventures.It  
 is clear that this is a viable farming
  concern with healthy return and      
 interest being shown by the Ministry. </content>
