		<content> A quarter of the land in the area is  
 park land.  Some of this is cultivated
 and the remainder is either woodland  
 or grazing.   There are some areas of 
 woodland which is mostly cared for by 
 the Forestry Commission or the Flint- 
 shire Woodlands who cope with the     
 planting and the harvesting of the    
 trees.  This is another form of employ
 -ment in the area.   There are deer   
 roaming in the woodlands around the   
 park and a Deer Ranger is employed for
 the caring and culling of the deer.   
 A Water Bailiff controls the fishing  
 in the River Elwy and a Gamekeeper is 
 employed on the Kinmel Estate for the 
 rearing and shooting of pheasants (a  
 private shoot).                       
 The local Fint and Denbigh Hunt       
 controls the fox population in the    
 area.
