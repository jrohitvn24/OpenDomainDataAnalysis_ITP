		<title>01GENERAL AREA OF HUNDLETON</title>
		<content> Hundleton is a small village at the   
 meeting point of five roads and lanes.
 It is situated at the north-east      
 corner of the area which stretches 4  
 km to the west and 3 km to the south  
 of it.                                
 The village is on top of a ridge which
 runs downhill to the south-west to a  
 stream before rising again into the   
 extreme south-west corner of the area.
 The main route across the area runs   
 from Pembroke in the east to Angle in 
 the west. It goes south-west first, to
 a junction at which stands a public   
 house - 'The Speculation' - then west 
 to Angle, whilst a minor road         
 continues south-west to the hamlet of 
 Castlemartin.                         
 Other roads connect Hundleton to      
 Bentlass on the Pembroke River,       
 Orielton Field Centre and local farms.
