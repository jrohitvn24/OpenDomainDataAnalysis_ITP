		<content> The block is littered with old mine   
 workings many of which are now being  
 made safe by the County Council (the  
 area around the field centre was      
 extensively repaired in 1983).Although
 many of the signs of these activities 
 remain especially at the bigger mines 
 such as at Gritt Hill and Roman       
 Gravels others which we now existed   
 are more difficult to find as nature  
 reclaims the land.                    
 It is a popular spot for geology      
 students as well as for schoolchildren
 from the County who come looking for  
 samples of quartz crystal and galena  
 which are easily found.
