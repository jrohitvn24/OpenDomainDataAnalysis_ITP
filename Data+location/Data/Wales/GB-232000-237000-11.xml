 During the week of May 13_17th our    
 class did a survey of the traffic that
 passed through the village square of  
 Velindre. One group surveyed the      
 direction and the other group the     
 colour of each vehicle. We found that 
 the following cars went through : 37  
 brown cars, 35 blue cars, 21 cream    
 cars, 15 yellow cars, 13 grey cars, 12
 black cars,40 red cars and 3 purple   
 cars. The  most popular colour was red
 and the least popular was purple. We  
 saw many different kinds of lorries.  
 There were Telecom, grocery, coal,    
 furniture and pop lorries. We counted 
 14 lorries in our survey.Many vans    
 passed through _ paper, mail, telecom 
 and bread vans _ in all, 61 vans  went
 through during the week. The total    
 number of  vehicles we counted was
