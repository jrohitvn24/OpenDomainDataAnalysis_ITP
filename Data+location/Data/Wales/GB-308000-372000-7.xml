		<title>07BEEKEEPING</title>
		<content> We asked Mr.D.L.Jones a few questions 
 about beekeeping as he is a beekeeper 
 himself.He told us the following:-He  
 has 10 hives. There are 50,000 bees in
 every hive. In the winter there is not
 much to do.He feeds them with sugar   
 and water.He also told us that he'd   
 been doing it for 10 years. He has a  
 sort of uniform that he wears.It      
 consists of a pair of wellingtons, an 
 overall, a pair of gloves, and a black
 veil.Mr.Jones uses a smoker to get    
 them in a good mood.This is how.He    
 puffs smoke into the hives.The bees   
 think there is a fire and fill        
 themselves with honey.When they are   
 filled with honey and in a good mood  
 they are less likely to sting.They    
 collect nectar and pollen from the    
 flowers.They like clover very much.He 
 takes them up to Moel Fammau for      
 heather.                              </content>
