		<content> The{Calvinist Chapel}was formed in    
 1789 with members meeting in a private
 house. In 1824 the first{Moria Chapel 
 was built, this was enlarged in 1851  
 In 1897 the present Moria was         
 errected at a cost of Â£1,250 and the  
 Manse built at a cost of Â£434. A      
 service for adult and a Sunday School 
 are held in Welsh every Sunday.       
 Although small in number ( presently  
{128)}this chapel has a great influence
 on the life of the village. There is a
 Literary Society whose membership is  
 open to anyone and they hold an Annual
 Eisteddfod in the Village Hall.       
 The Harvest and Christmas Carol       
 Services are bilingual and are held in
 the Methodist Chapel or St Bueno's    
 Church. funerals are also usually     
 bilingual with all the ministers often
 joining together.
