		<content> This is a world wide company making   
 wax covered containers to hold a      
 variety of liquids.  In 1984 more than
 2,000 million cartons were produced   
 for customers throughout the U.K..    
 Very large rolls of paper are put into
 printing presses and this continuous  
 process have the patterns and names   
 printed on to them bonded on to       
 plastic cut to shape ready for folding
 and filling by the customers.  It is  
 highly mechanised and extremly clean. 
 The workforce is entirely male and    
 they drive fork lift trucks to move   
 the raw materials.  There are plans to
 extend the factory which include      
 changing the channel of the river     
 Clywedog.  The aim is to double       
 production by 1988.  The men work a   
 two shift system and there are very   
 good realationships between managment 
 and staff.                            </content>
