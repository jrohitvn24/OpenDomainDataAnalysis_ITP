		<content> The reigon is crossed by two main     
 roads,the A483(T) carrying traffic    
 between the Midlands and the Wrexham  
 area and the A539 from Llangollen to  
 Whitchurch.A few minor roads bring    
 traffic from the outlying villages    
 such as Penycae and Eyton.            
 St. Mary's school did a traffic census
 in Ruabon,the results indicating an   
 average of 1200 vehicles per hour,2/3 
 were cars and 1/5 goods vehicles.The  
 new bypass to be started              
 shortly,should significantly alter the
 character of Ruabon's main street,now 
 heavily congested.A railway line      
 crosses the region with a station at  
 Ruabon.Once a major route carrying    
 through trains between London and     
 Birkenhead and the Cambrian           
 coast,today the station averages 10   
 trains each way daily between         
 Shrewsbury and Chester.               </content>
