		<title>02Housing/Industry in Glanaman</title>
		<content>    Glanaman is situated on the        
 Northern edge of the South Wales      
 coalfield and owes its development to 
 the presence of workable coal seams in
 the area. Housing has developed in a  
 ribbon pattern along the valley floor;
 the main street being lined with      
 traditional terraced and/or semi-     
 detached houses.                      
    In recent years, many newer houses 
 and bungalows have been built on the  
 peripheries of the village, whilst    
 away from the main thoroughfare, the  
 village retains its country atmosphere
 with fields, woods and outlying farms.
    The coal industry has now declined 
 in Glanaman; a landscaped park now    
 stands on what was once the site of   
 the Gelli Ceidrim Colliery. However,  
 many local people are still involved  
 with coal mining in the surrounding   
 area.                                 </content>
