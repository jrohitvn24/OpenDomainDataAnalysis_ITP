		<content>  Brian Owen is the village blacksmith.
 His father established the Forge in   
 1920 and Brian started working with   
 his father in 1960.The workshop is in 
 the main street of the village and is 
 very important as it employs two men, 
 Charlie and Robert.This is full-time  
 employment,five days a week from      
 9am-6pm.Jean Owen, Brian's wife helps 
 with the office work and answers the  
 telephone.The work is very varied,from
 mending farm machinery for the large  
 local farming community, to making    
 ornamental metal work e.g.lights and  
 garden fencing.Their latest project is
 making children's playground equipment
 for the camp sites and parks in the   
 neighbourhood.Brian likes his work    
 very much as it is a creative job.Each
 day is interesting with something     
 different to mend or make.
