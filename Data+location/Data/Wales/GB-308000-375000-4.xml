 There is a network of public footpaths
 criss-crossing the area. Before the   
 advent of the Motor-car, these        
 footpaths were well used and necessary
 for the inhabitants, many of them now 
 having fallen into disuse. At present 
 the main footpath which passes through
 the block is the long distance        
 "Offa's Dyke Footpath" which stretches
 from Prestatyn on the North Wales     
 Coast to Chepstow on the Bristol      
 Channel. This was planned by the      
 Countryside  Commission and officially
 opened in 1972. It mostly follows the 
 line of old established paths but in  
 some places it follows little used    
 minor roads. It is popular with       
 walkers all year round.
