		<content> Being an elderly resident of the      
 village,I have to rely on relatives   
 and friends for their help.I live     
 alone in a large house and can only   
 go out with someone's help.I need     
 assistance to go shopping,to visit the
 doctor's surgery or hospital as there 
 is a limited bus service.             
 A lady homehelp comes once a week to  
 help with household chores.Every      
 fortnight a window cleaner calls to   
 clean the outside windows.A           
 hairdresser calls whenever I ask.I    
 love my garden but my arthritis       
 restricts what I can do so two good   
 friends keep it neat and tidy for me. 
 Friends help me to walk the short     
 distance to the village hall so I can 
 enjoy W.I. meetings,bingo and whist   
 drives.I value everyones' help,       
 without them I would be very lonely.
