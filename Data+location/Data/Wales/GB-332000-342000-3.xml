 agricultural.The main area around     
 Erbistock is dairy farmed,that is     
 permanent grass for the rearing of    
 milk cattle.Some beef cattle and sheep
 are kept but no pigs.Beef cattle are  
 grass fed, grazing outside for most of
 the year and fed on silage in the     
 winter.Where there is an intensive    
 bull beef system, the bulls are reared
 inside for 12 months.There is a small 
 percentage of corn grown, consisting  
 of winter barley, winter wheat and    
 spring barley.A small acreage of      
 potatoes is grown and sugar beet is a 
 new crop in the area.                 
    Milk is sent to the Milk Marketing 
 Board's Maelor Creamery.The beef      
 cattle are killed in abbatoirs by the 
 dead weight system.Sheep are sold in  
 the Welshpool or local markets as are 
 other stock,at Wrexham and Oswestry.  </content>
