 Eventually each child will put a foot 
 wrong and be out.                     
 In Saundersfoot school playground     
 there is a painted netball pitch and  
 the boys have made up the following   
 game called Line Touch.From a crowd   
 one boy is selected as the catcher.In 
 ten seconds all others must get away  
 from him.Every boy must keep to the   
 lines on the ground and when          
 touched by the catcher then becomes   
 the new catcher.The excitement mounts 
 when groups of boys are caught        
 together among the lines and cannot   
 get away.
