		<content> Breakfast.                            
 We asked the thirty children in our   
 class what they ate for breakfast.Five
 children had no breakfast,the other 25
 having cereal.There are many different
 cereals that you can buy in packets.  
 Weetabix,Shredded Wheat,Cornflakes,   
 Special K and Sugar Puffs are some of 
 the most popular.Half of the class    
 also ate toast for breakfast.I had a  
 Yoghurt.Fried breakfasts used to be   
 very popular.It is called the Great   
 British Breakfast and consists of     
 fried bacon,fried egg,sausage and     
 fried bread.It is not as popular today
 because people believe that fried food
 is not good for you.In the winter many
 of the children have hot porridge with
 sugar or sypup on it.In the last two  
 years Breakfast Television has        
 started.Before 1983 there were no     
 television programmes in the morning. </content>
