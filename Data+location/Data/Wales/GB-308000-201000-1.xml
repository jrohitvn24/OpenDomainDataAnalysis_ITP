     The area surveyed covers mainly   
 mountain area.The only inhabited area 
 is the village of{Bedlinog.}          
     This is a small village,population
 just under 2000 but sixty years ago   
 was a very busy coal mining           
 village.The coal produced was taken to
 Dowlais Iron works.The population was 
 much larger then but has decreased    
 because of :_                         
 1> closure of local colleris          
 2> smaller families                   
 3> families moving southward to       
 Trelewis and Nelson because very      
 little housing development has taken  
 place since 1948.
