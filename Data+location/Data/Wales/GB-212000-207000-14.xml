		<content> I live in Kilgetty and my name is     
 Clare Hewett.  On Mondays I go dancing
 with Helen Brush.  On Tuesdays I go to
 Guides and we do exciting things like 
 going to camp.  I have two brothers   
 and we live by a forest.  There used  
 to be a tram line there and I can see 
 the remains of coal.  We used to live 
 in Scotland but I was born in Ireland.
 On Friday my mum gets the Tenby       
 Observer newspaper.  There is a       
 competition every week.  I did this   
 week's competition.  It was about     
 foods and which countries they came   
 from.
