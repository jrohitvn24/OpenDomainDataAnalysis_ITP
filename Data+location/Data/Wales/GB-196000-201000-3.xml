		<title>03LAND FEATURES-COSHESTON AREA</title>
		<content>  The land in this block has two ridges
 running from east to west.The rock    
 under the surface of both ridges is   
 old red sandstone .The southern ridge 
 reaches a height of 70 metres at      
 Mutton Hill and runs through the north
 of Pembroke.The more northerly ridge  
 runs through Cosheston village and    
 reaches a height of 59 metres.An inlet
 from the Cleddau River (Cosheston     
 Pill) separates the ridges and the    
 underlying rock between the ridges is 
 carboniferous limestone. There are    
 some old lime quarries near Lower     
 Nash.                                 
   The area is very pretty, mostly     
 covered by rolling farmland, with some
 areas of woodland and many trees in   
 the high hedgerows which border most  
 of the lanes. Apart from farmhouses,  
 the only houses in the area are in    
 Cosheston and north Pembroke.         </content>
