		<content> Most households use electricity for   
 cooking and some for heating. Mains   
 gas is not laid on; a few people use  
 bottled gas. Some have solid-fuel or  
 oil Agas or Rayburns. 50 to 75 per    
 cent have central heating. Coal or    
 anthracite is burned. The villages    
 have mains water and drainage but some
 outlying farms and houses do not.     
 Almost everyone has a washing-machine 
 and refrigerator and about 50 per cent
 have deep-freezes for preserving      
 home-grown and bulk-bought supplies.  
 Carmarthen is the main shopping centre
 for many people who visit it about    
 once weekly to stock up. Some old     
 fashioned customs persist: many       
 housewives make bread, preserve       
 vegetables and fruit for the winter by
 freezing or bottling and make wine or 
 cordials, often from wild fruits and  
 flowers, and make jams.               </content>
