		<title>09A Day In Haverfordwest</title>
		<content>   It's an ordinary Saturday, and there
 is no school. I Wake up, eat my       
 breakfast and watch some T.V. and then
 go out to play with my friends. We    
 play races on our bikes.              
   We also play "mob", a simple game   
 where we pick someone to be "it" and  
 they have to count to a certain number
 while the others go to hide. The      
 person who is "it" shouts "Mob So &amp;   
 So 1 2 3". Later we play "Tig" which  
 is a game with a lot of running and   
 chasing sometimes called "Tag".       
   After playing I have my dinner,     
 bacon and chips, my Mum's chips are   
 like long fingers. After playing again
 I go indoors for my tea when I have   
 biscuits and cake and then I go out   
 for a short play on my bike and then I
 come in for supper which is meat,     
 potatoes, carrots and gravy. I then   
 watch a film on video and go to bed.  </content>
