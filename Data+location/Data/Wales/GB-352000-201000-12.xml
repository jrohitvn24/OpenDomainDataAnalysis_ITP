		<title>12BROCKWEIR BRIDGE</title>
		<content>    Brockweir bridge which is affecti- 
 onately known as the 'Gateway to the  
 Wye Valley'is to undergo major repairs
 in the Spring of 1986.The County      
 Surveyor had planned to close the     
 bridge during this Summer but fifty   
 villagers and local hoteliers protest-
 ed,as the village depends on tourism  
 in the Summer.Thework has been postpo-
 ned until next Spring.                
    The bridge which was built in 1906 
 is an iron structure.The cost of the  
 repairs is Â£180,000 and will be met by
 Gloucestershire and Gwent County Coun-
 cils.The carriageway will be reduced  
 to a single lane for six months then  
 completely closed for six months.A new
 waterproof membrane will be placed    
 under the road surface during fair    
 weather.The surveyors hope to keep    
 inconvenience down to a minimum as do 
 the villagers.                        </content>
