		<title>12HOUSING : SWANSEA WEST</title>
		<content> 1) Inter-war private housing is mainly
 found in the centre of our area, with 
 a mixture of semi- &amp; detached houses. 
                                       
 2) Post-war council housing is        
 concentrated at Sketty Park.This      
 estate has expanded rapidly since the 
 mid-sixties and is considered more    
 desirable than the 1930s council      
 estate at Townhill,particularly       
 because of the improved facilities in 
 the houses. Many council tenants have 
 purchased their houses.               
                                       
 3) Post-war private housing is centred
 to the West and North of the area. The
 typical house is semi-detached and has
 3 or 4 bedrooms. Since the 1960s,     
 garage/parking areas have become more 
 important as more people have been    
 able to afford their own cars and     
 public transport has declined.        </content>
