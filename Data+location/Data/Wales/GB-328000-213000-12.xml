		<title>12Farming in Abergavenny</title>
		<content>Abergavenny is a mixed farming area    
with arable,dairy and sheep-rearing.   
The most important was dairy but this  
has gone downhill since the Government 
changed its mind about paying farmers  
to produce moremilk and now pay them to
give up being dairy farmers.Instead    
many dairy farmers turned to beef      
production for prices were 10 pounds   
per calf in 1971 but now are 150 pounds
There are now more arable farms around 
Abergavenny than dairy farms.Market    
gardening has also become important in 
the area with Wernddu and Tredillion   
being the most important growers.The   
main crops are strawberries,raspberries
and gooseberries but apples and plums  
are also grown.Sheep-rearing also is   
important in the life of many farms    
around Abergavenny.
