		<content> The area to the south of the River Usk
 is sub-divided again by a ridge, at   
 the top of which is the village of    
 Christchurch. Prominent in the village
 is Holy Trinity Church, parts of which
 date from the 12th century.           
 Between the ridge and the River Usk   
 the land is used mainly for farming   
 whereas the majority of the land to   
 the south of the ridge is residential 
 with two large council built estates  
 at St.Julians and Ringland.           
 Road communications are playing an    
 important part in the development of  
 this part of the area with the M4 and 
 A449 linking us with the Midlands,    
 London and West Wales. Two hotels, The
 Ladbroke Mercury and The Celtic Manor 
 have been developed to cater for      
 conferences and trade shows, taking   
 full advantage of their closeness to  
 these major trunk roads.              </content>
