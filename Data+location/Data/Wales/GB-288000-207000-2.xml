 The village school is named Ysgol     
 Thomas Stephens after a well known    
 poet who lived in the village in the  
 last century.                         
 It is a primary school catering for   
 children between the ages of 4 and    
 11.At present there are 46 children on
 roll in 3 classes.Headteacher is Mr   
 Carmichael who takes Class 3,Mrs      
 Davies takes Class 2 and Mrs Coughlan 
 takes Class 1 with the help of a      
 nursery assistant Mrs Williams.       
 There is a small kitchen which        
 provides lunch for the children.      
 On leaving this school most children  
 go on to Ystradgynlais                
 Comprehensive,though children from the
 Ystradfellte area sometimes transfer  
 to Brecon High.A small number go to   
 Church schools or private schools.
