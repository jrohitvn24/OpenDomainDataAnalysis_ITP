		<content> This area of the infrastructure of the
 area shows signs of decline _empty    
 shops;the most noticeable being the   
 large premises formely housing the    
 Co-op.                                
                                       
 Other needs,such as banking,are       
 catered for by the major banking      
 houses being represented.             
 Public houses and clubs are also well 
 represented in this area.             
                                       
 For major items such as cars,furniture
 and electrical goods people travel to 
 larger centres such as Newport.       
                                       
 Outside the main area of shops there  
 are several small groups of shops _   
 usually associated with a sub         
 post_office or public house. In this  
 respect the population is well served 
 and this indicates former prosperity. </content>
