		<content> This area is dominated by the moorland
 areas known as FFOREST FACH - the     
 Little Forest - which is a triangular 
 upland measuring about 2 km East-West 
 and 3 km North-South.   To the East   
 lies the valley known as CWM TREWEREN.
 This stream flows into the Afon Senni 
 at Defynnog, about 1 km upstream of   
 the Senni with the River Usk at Senny-
 bridge.                               
 To the West of Fforest Fach is the    
 valley known as CWM CRAI, this river  
 flowing into the Usk between Trecastle
  and Sennybridge.                     
 The bare moorland of Fforest Fach     
 rises to a height of 380 metres. Both 
 valleys are between 250 and 200       
 metres.                               
 The area is sparsely populated and the
 settlement everywhere comprises small 
 isolated farms.  The area lies within 
 the BRECON BEACONS NATIONAL PARK.     </content>
