		<content> GREAT EXCITMENT WAS FELT IN THE AREA  
 AT THE TIME OF THE PARLIMENTARY       
 BY-ELECTION TO REPLACE THE            
 CONSERVATIVE TOM HOOSAN. THIS WAS     
 HERALDED BY THE NATIONAL PRESS AS A   
 FORE-TASTE OF THE NEXT GENERAL        
 ELECTION AND THEREFORE OF GREAT       
 INTEREST. NEVER BEFORE HAVE SO FEW    
 PEOPLE BEEN WOOED BY SO MANY PUBLIC   
 FIGURES. THE LABOUR CANDIDATE, DR     
 WHILLEY AND THE ALLIANCE CANDIDATE MR 
 R. LIVESLEY, IN PARTICULAR INUNDATED  
 THE AREA WITH THEIR SUPPORTERS  AND   
 PAMPHLETS IN ORDER TO CANVASS THE     
 VOTERS. SCREAMING LORD SUTCH AND THE  
 PLAID CYMRU CANDIDATE SEEMED TO HAVE  
 MORE INFLUENCE THAN THE CONSERVATIVE  
 CANDIDATE AND SATISFACTION WAS        
 APPARENT WHEN THE ALLIANCE CANDIDATE  
 WON THE SEAT
