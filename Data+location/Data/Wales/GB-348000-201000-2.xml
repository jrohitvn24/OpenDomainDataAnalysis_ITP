		<content> Mixed farming is practised on 3OO     
 acres of land in Trelleck Grange. l7O 
 acres is arable land, which is home to
 ll5 dairy cows and l8 beef cows.      
 Potatoes and oats are grown, as well  
 as Winter wheat and barley.  Everybody
 gets up at 6 o'clock to milk the cows.
 From then onwards, cleaning the       
 milking parlour, feeding and checking 
 the health of all stock takes them    
 through to lunch-time. Occasionally   
 there is a visit from the vet or      
 artificial insemination man.  At      
 certain times of the year the crops   
 are sprayed with fertiliser or        
 insecticide.  Other tasks include     
 repairing fencing, outbuildings and   
 barns.  At 4 o'clock it is time for   
 milking again, until 6 o'clock when   
 they finish their farming.
