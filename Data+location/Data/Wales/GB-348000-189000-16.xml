		<content>  We did a survey in our area on       
 employment.  We discovered that 75% of
 the females were fully employed and   
 100% of the males were fully employed.
 36% of the men worked for a public    
 body as did 50% of the women.  Private
 companies employed 33% of the men and 
 25% of the women.                     
  Just over 53% of the males had jobs  
 which were of a managerial nature, but
 only 16% of the females had any       
 managerial responsibility.            
  The average distance a female        
 travelled to work was 3.5 miles but   
 for men this distance increased to 11 
 miles.                                
  Women spent about 5.7 hours a day at 
 their place of work but men averaged  
 about 9.5 hours at their employment.  
  Most people spent five days a week at
 work, with an average of 32 days      
 holiday per annum.                    </content>
