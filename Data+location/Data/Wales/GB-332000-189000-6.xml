		<content> We have some annual events,such as    
 sports days ,prize giving and a       
 Christmas Nativity Play or Carol      
 Service.The school year begins in     
 September and is divided into three   
 terms,each lasting approximately      
 thirteen weeks.We have two weeks      
 holiday both at Christmas and at      
 Easter;six weeks in the summer and one
 week near the middle of each term.    
 Compared with many junior schools in  
 the area,we are well off for equipment
 and facilities.                       
               We have a large         
 playground and playing field and      
 showers which we use after sporting   
 activities.As well as the classrooms  
 we have separate rooms for music,     
 television and video,maths and science
 and the computer.
