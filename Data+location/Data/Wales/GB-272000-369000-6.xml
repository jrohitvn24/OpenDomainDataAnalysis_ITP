		<title>06Employment in Caerhun Parish</title>
		<content> Employment varies greatly but farming 
 is predominant. It is mostly hill     
 farming but there is some arable      
 farming in low-lying areas. Major     
 employers in the area are Dolgarrog   
 Aluminium Works, the Electricity Board
 and the Welsh Water Authority.        
 Examples of other employment are:     
 gardening and nursery work, carpentry,
 double glazing, heavy goods vehicle   
 driving, school canteen and pupil     
 supervision. A few young people work  
 in the village cafe. Shop assistants, 
 a teacher, a doctor, a builder and a  
 philatelist live in this area.Some    
 people travel as far as Holyhead and  
 Chester to work. Many inhabitants are 
 retired. All agree it is a happy,     
 law-abiding community.
