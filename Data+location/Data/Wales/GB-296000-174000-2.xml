		<title>02Cowbridge Half Marathon</title>
		<content> It was a breezy morning on Sunday 12th
 May, the day of the Cowbridge Fire    
 Station Half Marathon. The runners    
 assembled outside the Cowbridge fire  
 station for the start at 10:00am. The 
 500 runners made quite a spectacle as 
 they moved off towards Eastgate and on
 to the St.Athan Road. As they went on 
 to the St.Athan Road the steepest hill
 on the course loomed up ahead of them.
  Meanwhile the streets of Cowbridge   
 became lined with people eager to     
 welcome the first runner home. An hour
 and ten minutes later their patience  
 was rewarded as Ian Beard of          
 Abertillary crossed the line. The     
 first woman to finish was Veronica    
 Singleton from the Les Croupiers Club 
 in Cardiff, and her time was 1hr      
 27mins. As everyone crossed the line  
 they received a medal and certificate.
