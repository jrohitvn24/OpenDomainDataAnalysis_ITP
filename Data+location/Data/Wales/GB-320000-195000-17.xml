		<content>          NEWBRIDGE IN 1965            
  researched by Sarah Probert          
    Q.What entertainment was there in  
 the Newbridge area?                   
      People either went to the        
 cinema or to a dance.People did not go
 out for a meal as they do now.I always
 went to the Memo, where there were    
 three dances a week, one on Tuesday,  
 one on Thursday and a big one         
 Saturday, you would buy your ticket   
 and it didn't finish till twelve so if
 you lived a long way from there you   
 would buy a bus ticket because they   
 had special buses.                    
                                       
 Q.Were there vandals like today?      
      No not really but there was      
 always a fight between the boys from  
 different villages.They used to wear  
 knuckle dusters and chains and they   
 always fought down the  boys clubs.   </content>
