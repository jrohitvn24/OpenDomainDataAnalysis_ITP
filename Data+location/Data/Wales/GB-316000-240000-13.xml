		<title>13Life by the Wye-by Richard.</title>
		<content>  Life by this river is fairly exciting
 in winter.This year 1985 is the first 
 time I have ever seen the river frozen
 right over from the left side to the  
 right side.In the summer people jump  
 off the bridge into the river.Last    
 year, 1984 a man jumped into the river
 and cracked his head open,broke his   
 arm,leg and wrist.This is a dangerous 
 place for swimming and jumping.Under  
 the bridge there are whirlpools.There 
 is a house near the river which gives 
 canoe lessons and hires them out for  
 use in the summer.Lots of tourists    
 visit the river in summer and I'm     
 afraid they often leave a lot of      
 horrid litter.The ice_cream van does  
 a roaring trade.No motor boats are    
 allowed on the river.It is great fun  
 living near this beautiful river.I    
 think I am a very lucky boy.
