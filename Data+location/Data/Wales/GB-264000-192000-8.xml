 ------Saturday June 1st AM------      
                                       
 My parents' day started at 3.00am.    
 when my sister woke up for a feed.My  
 dad spent 2 more hours trying to put  
 my sister to sleep. At 7.ooam, I woke 
 up. I then read in bed until breakfast
 time.  After having a good read I went
 downstairs and played on my computer. 
 At 9.15 we were all washed and ready  
 for breakfast. After breakfast we all 
 got ready for town.  At midday we went
 to town to get shoes for my brother   
 and myself. It didn't take very long  
 so my mum and I left my dad to pay and
 we went to British Home Stores and    
 then to Marks and Spencers where we   
 bought tennis shorts.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
