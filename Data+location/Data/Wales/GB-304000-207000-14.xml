		<title>14Museum Attendant-Interview.</title>
		<content> When we visited Cyfarthfa Castle      
 Museum we interviewed the attendant   
 Mr.Tudor Morgan.He had been working   
 there for many years.He enjoyed his   
 work particularly when talking to the 
 visitors about Merthyr's past.People  
 sometimes came from as far away as    
 America to try and trace their Welsh  
 ancesters.Mr. Morgan told us how he   
 was fascinated by their life stories. 
 However there were things he did not  
 like about the job:he spent most of   
 the day standing which was very       
 tiring,and it could be a rather lonely
 job.Although he enjoyed the job he was
 looking forward to his retirement when
 he could give more time to his hobbies
 of drawing,dancing and playing the    
 organ.He said he would like to move to
 the south coast and live in a         
 bungalow.
