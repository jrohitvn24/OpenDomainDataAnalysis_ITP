		<title>02MORRIS CASTLE, SWANSEA (1)</title>
		<content>   Morris Castle, or Castle Graig as it
 is also known, is situated on high    
 ground at Trewyddfa and is unusual in 
 that although only just over 210 years
 old, it is listed as an Ancient       
 Monument. Extensive restoration work  
 is scheduled for this year (1985).    
   Castle Graig was built about 1768 by
 John Morris, an industrialist. Housing
 was needed for his work force of coal 
 miners and copper workers, and this   
{'castle',}really a tenement{block,}was
 built, the first of its kind in the   
 world.                                
   The 'castle' was built around a     
 central courtyard with a tower of four
 floors at each corner. The towers were
 linked by three-storey blocks, the top
 block crowned with mock battlements.  
 It is thought that up to 24 families  
 were housed there.                    
   The building is now in disrepair.   </content>
