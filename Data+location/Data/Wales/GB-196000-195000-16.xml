		<title>16Stackpole Court</title>
		<content>   Stackpole was originally a Norman   
 settlement and it was only in the mid 
 nineteen seventies that all feudal    
 ties were broken.It was then that Lord
 Cawdor sold his estate to an insurance
 trust.                                
    In 1961 Lord Cawdor demolished his 
 mansion thus causing an outcry in the 
 locality. All that is now left are the
 stables and outbuildings which have   
 been converted into flats.In the roof 
 of the flats lives a colony of greater
 horseshoe bats which are extremely    
 rare.They are now a protected species 
 but a local man,unaware of their      
 rarity, was intending to gas          
 them.Luckily a bat expert was able to 
 identify the bats, and they were      
 saved.                                
   The stables are also said to be     
 haunted. Many people have seen the    
 ghost of an old lady.                 </content>
