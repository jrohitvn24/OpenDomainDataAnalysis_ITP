		<title>11The Llynfi Valley</title>
		<content>{Caerau}is at the top of the{Llynfi    
{Valley.}It is called the{Llynfi Valley
 because the river{Llynfi}runs through 
 it. The mountain near the river Llynfi
 is called Caerau mountain but         
 on the ordinance survey map it is     
 called{Mynydd y Caerau.}The mountain  
 opposite is called the{Afan mountain. 
 People believed the{Romans}built      
{fortresses on}the mountain that is    
 what gave Caerau its name. The        
 mountain today has been spoiled by    
 people dumping{litter}and other waste 
 materials on it. This rubbish can be  
 harmful to the wild life on the       
 mountain and the sheep which use it   
 for grazing. If you go for a walk     
 on the mountain it is a very pleasant.
 When they are in season it is possible
 to pick blackberries and wimberries   
 there.
