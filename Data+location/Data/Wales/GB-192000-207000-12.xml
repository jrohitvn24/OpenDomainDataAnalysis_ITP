		<content>    Rosemarket has had a Parish Council
 for more than 100 years.Twelve years  
 ago its name was changed to Community 
 Council.There are three types of      
 council in the area _ the Community   
 Council who look after Rosemarket and 
 area;Preseli Council look after       
 Haverfordwest and region; and Dyfed   
 Council looks after the whole of      
 Dyfed.                                
  There are 7 elected members and 1    
 clerk on the Community Council.There  
 are elections every 4 years and       
 members can be re_elected for further 
 terms.Councillors have meetings 11    
 times a year,but if there is anything 
 important to talk about they have an  
 extra_ordinary meeting.The clerk's job
 is to take notes in all the meetings  
 and to pay people to clean the bus    
 shelters.The councillors do not get   
 paid.                                 </content>
