 Our class  have done a project on can 
 recycling. Some of the activites we   
 did were making posters, badges, games
 and models. We even wrote to important
 people like Margaret Thatcher,Leo Abse
 and Prince Charles. We've managed to  
 get a can bank in our school grounds  
 to collect  cans. We have got the     
 whole school to collect cans. We have 
 gone to the infants school, and have  
 done an assembly. We've also shown    
 them the videos of us on television.  
 The reason that we are collecting cans
 is that it helps a charity, it saves  
 energy, stops litter, reduces waste   
 and protects the enviroment. I have   
 made my own save_a_can game called    
 "Canservation." Our class sent it off 
 and a few months later it came back   
 published.                            </content>
