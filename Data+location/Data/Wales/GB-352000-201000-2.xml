		<title>02FORESTRY IN THE WYE VALLEY</title>
		<content>  Most of the woodlands in the lower   
 Wye valley area are owned and managed 
 by the Forestry Commission.The Commis-
 ion are responsible for the harvesting
 and replanting of their plantations.  
   The woodlands in the area are a mix-
 ture of broadleaved and coniferous    
 trees.The Commission sometimes plants 
 them together to add variety and for  
 conservation and timber production.   
 Great care is taken not to alter the  
 character of the woodlands.In the area
 they have provided picnic sites and   
 trails for the many visitors.One      
 picnic site near Cleddon Falls has had
 to be abandoned because of the        
 invasion of giant ants.               
     Whatever time of the year you     
 visit the woodlands the views are     
 dramatic and colourful,autumn is part-
 cularly spectacular because of the    
 contrasting mixture of foliage.       </content>
