 100 years ago for one reason but now  
 perform different job.                
{The Maltings.}was a large factory in  
 1887 used for making malt from barley:
 stopped in the 1970's,the building    
 became empty.Today the original 3     
 huge halls have been converted into   
 small industrial units.               
{Eastmoors Hall.}was designed as a     
 mission hall for the 'Forward         
 Movement'.Between the two world wars  
 it became known for its Magic Lantern 
 shows.Now it houses the Splott Youth  
 Centre.
