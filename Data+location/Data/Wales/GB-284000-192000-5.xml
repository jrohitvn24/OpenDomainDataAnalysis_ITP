		<title>05Shopping Habits</title>
		<content> In{Caerau}there are a few small       
{supermarkets.}There is the Spar,the   
 Coop and a few corner shops. They are 
 quite small. Some people go to        
 Gateway and International in{Maesteg  
 for it is cheaper and there is a wider
 choice of goods, however it is costly 
 to go to Maesteg by bus. My           
 mother usually walks down to Maesteg  
 and walks back but if it is raining   
 she catches the bus.Some people       
 go to Maesteg to buy clothes. One of  
 the clothes shops is called New Look. 
 Most people go shopping on            
 Thursday or Friday because they have  
 their pay then. There is an{open air  
{market}in Maesteg every Friday where a
 wide range of goods is sold and people
 come from miles around.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
