		<title>05BODFARI COMMUNITY COUNCIL</title>
		<content>      In 1985 the community council    
 bought some land that was the site of 
 an old derelict quarry near the old   
 Bodfari School.They hope to develope  
 the area as a playground for the      
 children of the village.              
         At present there is no        
 playground for the children in the    
 parish of Bodfari, though there is one
 in the parish of Aberwheeler on the   
 other side of the busy A541.          
         The council hope to include   
 slides and swings as well as erecting 
 goal posts.It is also hoped to have a 
 bowling green, picnic area and a      
 toilet block.An access road from the  
 A541 will have to be built.It is      
 expected that the project will take   
 about two years to be completed.
