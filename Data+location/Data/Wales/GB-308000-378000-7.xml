		<title>07TRANSPORT IN TRELAWNYD</title>
		<content> The sad decline of public transport is
 sorely felt by many of the elderly    
 residents in the village.  Although   
 most families own a car. it is the    
 older citizens who miss the regular   
 bus service into either Rhyl or       
 Holywell.  There are now only 6 buses 
 from the village a day, all going to  
 Rhyl.  The busis considered important 
 for people requiring transport to     
 visit the Doctor or Hospital, or else 
 to the Supermarket.  The village has  
 now only one shop. and this obviously 
 cannot cover all the requirements of  
 the villagers.                        
 The return fare to Rhyl, 8 miles      
 away, is 91p single for an adult.     
 Only a few of the residents possess   
 and use either a bicycle or a motor   
 cycle. A bus goes to the Point of Ayr 
 Colliery but now carris only a few    
 miners.                               </content>
