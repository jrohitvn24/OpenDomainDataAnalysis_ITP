		<title>01The Village.</title>
		<content> Pontneathvaughan is the anglicized    
 name of the village most commonly used
 and is a corruption of the old Welsh  
 name Pontneddvechan which is          
 still used on maps.It is a small      
 village with only a limited amount of 
 employment and most people have to    
 commute to work.The chief industries  
 are tourism and farming.              
 There are three pubs,two clubs,and a  
 small post office and village store   
 combined.There are two chapels,one    
 church and a village hall which is in 
 the process of construction.The only  
 other public amenity is the primary   
 school which is described in greater  
 detail on page 2.                     
 The nearest town,where most of the    
 villagers do their shopping is        
 Glynneath which is about 2 miles      
 away.The large town of Neath is about 
 8 miles away and Swansea 15 miles.    </content>
