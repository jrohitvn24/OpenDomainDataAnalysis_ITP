		<title>07HISTORY of RHAYADER</title>
		<content> The area has been inhabited since the 
 Neolithic period and has documented   
 history since 12th century,when there 
 was a wooden castle and moat.The      
 Rhayader Jewellery found on Gwastedyn 
 Hill consists of 2nd or 3rd century   
 Roman items in gold and is now kept in
 the British Museum.  Rhayader became a
 Shire town by the Act of Union 1536   
 but lost this after the Judge was     
 murdered in 1540.  Due to its site the
 town became the main stopping point   
 for Drovers driving animals to markets
 in England. This is the reason for the
 large number of inns in the town.     
   The poor state of the Turnpike roads
 caused the Rebecca Riots in 1843 when 
 the Tollgates were attacked.The main  
 language until 18th century was Welsh 
 decreasing steadily as trading with   
 the English increased until present   
 day when English is predominant.      </content>
