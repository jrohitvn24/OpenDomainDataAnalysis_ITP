		<title>11Shearing at Demesne Farm</title>
		<content> In May the sheep are brought from the 
 hill into the pen for shearing. A few 
 sheep are transferred into a smaller  
 pen. Richard opens the gate and Dad   
 and Grandad bring one sheep onto the  
 shearing board. The fleece is shorn   
 off the sheep in such a way that it   
 does not break. The sheep has JS      
 printed on its back in red. I spread  
 the fleece on the floor and pull the  
 two long sides together into the      
 middle. I roll the fleece up from the 
 tail end (if I can tell which end is  
 which), leaving a bit at the neck end.
 I twist this piece, pull it round the 
 roll and tuck it under where it       
 started. Then I put the fleece in the 
 wool bag. Dad pays me 2p for each     
 fleece I wrap. This year I made       
 Â£1.02p.
