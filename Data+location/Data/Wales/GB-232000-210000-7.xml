		<title>07LLANSTEFFAN AREA: FARMING 1.</title>
		<content> All 31 holdings are grassland         
 livestock farms. Dairying, which was  
 the major enterprise, has recently    
 been replaced on some by beef and     
 sheep. About half still have a dairy  
 unit and many, particularly since milk
 quotas came in, have secondary beef   
 and/or sheep. Some augment their      
 income by wintering "tack" sheep from 
 the uplands. Size varies from less    
 than 30 to 240 acres with half being  
 under 60 acres and most of the        
 remainder averaging 190 acres. Some   
 farms have increased considerably from
 their original size by aquiring extra 
 land as farms are split up and sold. 3
 farmers are retired, their land being 
 let to neighbours. Nine of the farms  
 are tenanted, the remainder being     
 family owned and run. Little outside  
 labour is employed except at silage   
 and hay harvest.                      </content>
