		<content> Buses provide the main form of public 
 transport in the area,the biggest     
 operator being {Crosville}a subsidiary
 of the{National Bus Company}.Its green
 painted buses cover all of Anglesey   
 and mainland Gwynedd as well as the   
 North Wales coast and the north west  
 of England.                           
 Several private companies also run    
 local services i.e. to villages within
 a radius of about 15 miles of Bangor. 
 The main services are provided by     
{Deiniolen Motors and Purple Motors.}  
 The latter runs buses to{Bethesda.   }
 Apart from local services buses also  
 run from Bangor to such places as     
 Chester,London,the north of England   
 and South Wales.

 Manchester with a few small units     
 running to Holyhead and Liandudno.    </content>
