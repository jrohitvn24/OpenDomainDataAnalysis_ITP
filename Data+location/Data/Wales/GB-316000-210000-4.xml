 The group consists  of three factories
 in Gwent.The factory we  visited is in
 Ebbw Vale.It provides employment for  
 43 disabled people.This is achieved   
 with the help of grants from the      
 Manpower Services Commission.         
                       Employees are   
 trained by the group with skills      
 compatible to their disability.They   
 manufacture road traffic signs,plastic
 coated sign posts,wire guards and     
 general wire work,plastic engraved    
 nameplates and do sheet metal work.   
                             The       
 manager,Mr. Walton,made it possible   
 for us to visit the factory.It was the
 first time we had been to a factory   
 and we were very impressed by what we 
 saw.The employees were happy in their 
 work and were pleased to see us.
