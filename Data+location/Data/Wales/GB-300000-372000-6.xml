 IN CEFN MEIRIADOG(MARLI),THERE IS A   
 GROUP OF COUNCIL HOUSES CALLED "CAE   
 ONNEN".THEY RECEIVED THEIR NAME       
 BECAUSE THERE WAS A THICKET OF ASH    
 TREES THERE.THE HOUSES ARE ABOUT 45   
 YEARS OLD,AND CONTRAST TO THE NEWER   
 HOUSES ACROSS THE ROAD.IN 1981 MY     
 FATHER COMPLETED THE BUILDING OF MY   
 NEW HOME.AT ONE TIME,THERE WAS AN     
 ITALIAN WHO LIVED NEARBY AND ON OUR   
 LAND KEPT HIS PIGS.EVIDENCE OF THE PIG
 STIES CAN BE SEEN IN THE PILES OF     
 CONCRETE RUBBLE REMAINING IN ONE      
 CORNER OF THE FIELD.IN 1870 THE       
 GLASCOED WATERWORKS RESERVOIR WAS     
 BUILT BUT THE FIRST FILTER STATION WAS
 BUILT IN 1929 AND THE EXTENDED        
 BUILDING IN 1939.
