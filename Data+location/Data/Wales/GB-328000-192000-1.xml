		<title>01  Description of Cwmbran</title>
		<content>   Our square is the South Eastern     
 section of Cwmbran, the first new town
 in Wales, which has grown steadily    
 since 1947. In large housing estates  
 to the North of our square are robust 
 communities living in a wide range of 
 houses set amid large green play      
 areas. New houses are being built to  
 accomodate the increasing population  
 in the West, on the Hollybush Estate. 
   The Ty-Coch Estate and the new      
 Llantarnam Industrial Park offer a    
 wide range of facilities, from the    
 neighbourhood style units for the     
 smaller businesses, to a hi-tech show 
 factory.                              
   The South and West are still mainly 
 rural, parklands to the West and farms
 to the South. Industry and housing are
 however continually diminishing this.
