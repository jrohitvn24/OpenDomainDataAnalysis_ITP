		<title>17Penygawsi Estate Survey 2</title>
		<content>      The school survey of the estate  
 found out the following facts:-       
                                       
{    90%} travel to work by car        
{     1%}   "     "   "   " bus        
{    19%} of women walk to work        
{     2%} of  men   "    "  "          
                                       
 This estate is{heavily}dependent on   
 cars and is well connected to major   
 roads and the M4. Does it show us that
 people are "well off" because they can
 afford to run a car. There is only one
 main road out of the estate and in the
 winter it sometimes becomes "snow     
 blocked." Is bus transport unpopular  
 because of its expense? (a typical    
 journey of 8 miles costs Â£1.00) More  
 women work locally (64% work 1-6 miles
 away) and more can therefore walk to  
 work whereas most men (38% work 10-12 
 miles away in the Cardiff area.)      </content>
