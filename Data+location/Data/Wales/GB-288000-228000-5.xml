 The physical make up of Trecastle had 
 altered little since the nineteenth   
 century until the development of new  
 estates after the Second World War.   
 In the late 1940's came new Council   
 houses at Brynawelon just south of    
 Chapel Street when at the same time   
 houses were given an independent      
 supply of water and electricity became
 available.  The in the late 1950's and
 early 1960's a new council estate was 
 built at Bishopstown known as Maes y  
 Berllan.
