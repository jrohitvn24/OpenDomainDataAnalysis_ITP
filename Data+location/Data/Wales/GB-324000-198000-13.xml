		<title>13CHAPEL EVERY SUNDAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 I go to this chapel every Sunday at   
 2.30pm,for Sunday School.Mr Gard is   
 our minister.About 25 children attend 
 the chapel and there are 21 adults on 
 the membership.                       
      This is a community Chapel.All   
 the Christenings and Funeral services 
 for Blaendare are done here.It is a   
 wood and zinc building about 50years  
 old.                                  
    All the heaters were stolen from   
 the chapel but in two weeks,enough    
 money had been collected to buy more  
 and enough left over for moving the   
 entrance door from the road and       
 putting it on the side for safety.
