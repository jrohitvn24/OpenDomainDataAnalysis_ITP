		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NATALIE</title>
		<content> My alarm clock wakes me at 8          
 o'clock,but I don't always get up     
 staight away.My breakfast is usually  
 toast and tea,and after I help my     
 mother to get my little brother ready 
 for school,as she has to leave for    
 work.                                 
 At about 8.40 I walk down and meet my 
 friends and we have a gossip in the   
 yard before school starts.I quite like
 school work especially English.At     
 break times we either play games like 
 hopscotch or chasing or just sit and  
 talk.                                 
 After school I go staight home,have my
 tea and then go out to play.If it's   
 fine I'll play on my bike,but if it's 
 raining I may go the video shop with  
 my friend and watch a film in her     
 house.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
