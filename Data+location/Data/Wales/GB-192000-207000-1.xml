		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF BLOCK</title>
		<content>   Our block is a rural area covering  
 most of the triangle between Milford  
 Haven, Neyland and Johnston. The      
 countryside is undulating. It is      
 mainly managed grass_land, separated  
 by the narrow wooded valleys of small 
 streams. Settlement over most of the  
 block consists of scattered farms and 
 houses except for the village of Rose_
 market.                               
  Rosemarket was established in the    
 early 12th. Century as a borough and  
 was the market town for the Cantref   
 (hundred) of Rhos. It was built on the
 site of a much earlier Welsh          
 settlement.Its importance faded and   
 it has been an 'out of the way'       
 village for many centuries. Rosemarket
 is set on a hill. Each of the six     
 roads leading to the village takes you
 down a hill, across water then up     
 again.                                </content>
