		<title>11HOME LIFE IN LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> When husband is at work, older        
 children at school, mother at home    
 washes, usually by machine, irons,    
 cooks by solid fuel, electricity or   
 bottled gas, and does the other       
 housework. She can visit the Health   
 Clinic, Mother &amp; Toddler Group, Pre-  
 school Playgroup or the Children's    
 Playing Field.  All her provisions are
 available in Laugharne but shops      
 further afield for clothing, footwear,
 furnishing and hardware.  At night    
 people relax in front of TV, do their 
 own DIY decorating, visit local pubs, 
 walk or garden.  People still feel    
 safe in Laugharne.  Many people have  
 dogs or cats or a caged bird. Visiting
 relatives/friends locally or in       
 hospital etc. is a popular pastime.   
 Divorce rates seem lower than the     
 national average.
