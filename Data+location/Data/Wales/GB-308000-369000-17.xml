		<title>17BODFARI CONCRETE COMPANY</title>
		<content> One of the few industries in the      
 village of Bodfari is the concrete    
 works situated near the busy A541 on  
 the Tremeichion turn off.The raw      
 materials of cement,sand and stone are
 brought in and these are mixed in a   
 large electric mixer to make concrete.
            Many different concrete    
 products are made depending on demand_
 paving slabs,posts,balastrades        
 ornamental garden pots etc.All the    
 products are made in a metal mould    
 with plastic spacers holding steel    
 bars to strengthen the finished       
 article.The mould is placed on a      
 vibrating machine to compact the      
 cement and to allow air bubbles  to   
 escape.The concrete is then left to   
 harden in the mould.Sometimes a dye   
 is added to the raw material to colour
 the finished article.
