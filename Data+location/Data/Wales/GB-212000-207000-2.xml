		<title>02Pembrokeshire Houses.</title>
		<content> On the 23rd May, Helen, Annie and I,  
 Anne Thomas went towards Templeton    
 past Stoney Park and Tregellet where  
 we saw two small bridges. There we met
 Mr. Noon.  He said he really came from
 Hill Town near Derby.  He worked in a 
 factory making parachutes from        
 cellulose.  He said that if the       
 parachute did not open they called it 
 candling.  Mr. Noon has lived in Wales
 for sixteen years.  He lives in an old
 fashioned Pembrokeshire house.  It has
 two rooms and a shed built on.  There 
 is a big chimney in which people can  
 sit by the open fire.  There is an    
 upstairs to one end of the house.     
 There are lots of coniferous trees in 
 this area.  We saw the two bridges.   
 One is a "listed" pack horse bridge.  
 It is three feet wide.  The modern    
 bridge can hold a sixteen ton milk    
 lorry because we saw one on it.       </content>
