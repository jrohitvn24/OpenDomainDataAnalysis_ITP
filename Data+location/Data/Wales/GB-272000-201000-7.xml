		<title>07Leisure Centre Pontardawe</title>
		<content> This centre was recently opened on an 
 old steelworks site known as Parc     
 Ynisderw.  It is the first of its kind
 in Wales, being built to a standard   
 design devised and approved by the    
 Sports Council.  It is open to the    
 public for sporting and leisure       
 activities from 10.00 to 22.00 every  
 day.                                  
       Dominating the centre is an air 
 conditioned main hall, which houses   
 badminton courts and is also marked   
 out for basketball, netball, hockey   
 and volleyball.  Other sports catered 
 for will be cricket, roller-skating,  
 table tennis, martial arts, gymnastics
 and trampolining.  The hall will also 
 be used for social and other events.  
       Outdoor facilities consist of a 
 changing room complex, rugby &amp; soccer 
 pitches, artificial cricket wickets,  
 picnic area, play park and trim trail.</content>
