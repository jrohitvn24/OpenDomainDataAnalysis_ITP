		<content> My school has about thirty computers, 
 they are mainly BBC Computers. We do  
 not use these much, but, in the upper 
 school we will have computer lessons  
 each week.                            
                                       
 My computer at home is a Sinclair ZX  
 Spectrum, which has 48K of memory. It 
 is made by a British company, but most
 computers are made in America or      
 Japan. My friends have Sinclair or    
 Commodore Computers, the Commodore has
 64K of memory and is American. These  
 computers are quite cheap and there   
 are many games which you can play on  
 these computers, my favourite is      
 "Football Manager", where you are in  
 charge of a league soccer team. My    
 friends and I spend a lot of time     
 playing computer games.
