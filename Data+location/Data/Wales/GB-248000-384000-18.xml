		<content>{>Interview with the Lifeboat Coxswain 
 The Coxswain was appointed in October 
 1972, he would like a Tyne class boat 
 to the Rother class boat he has at    
 present, as it would be bigger and    
 faster.                               
 The Lifeboat went out last on June    
 22nd to search for two young canoeists
 lost off Cemaes Bay.                  
 The inshore boat carries out a lot of 
 important rescue work in this area    
 during the tourist season.The R.A.F.  
 RESCUE HELICOPTER from Valley also    
 works closely with the local Rescue   
 Services.                             
 The grandson of the Emperor of Japan  
 will be visiting the Lifeboat Station 
 in July.                              
         Owen Roberts.
