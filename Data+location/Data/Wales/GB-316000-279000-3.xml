		<content>   The present school was built in 1955
 with three classrooms, a hall and a   
 kitchen where the school meals are    
 cooked. In 1977 a purpose-built       
 nursery unit was added to the         
 building. The children start school   
 when they are four years old. When    
 they are eleven years old they        
 transfer to the John Beddoes          
 Comprehensive School at Presteigne.   
   Most of the children live outside   
 the village so they have to travel to 
 school by bus. Some of them live as   
 much as ten miles from the school.    
   All along the perimeter fence of the
 school are Japanese larch trees       
 planted by pupils in 1958 to celebrate
 the Festival of Wales. Also in the    
 school grounds are a swimming pool for
 learners and a wooden fort, built from
 logs for the children to play in.These
