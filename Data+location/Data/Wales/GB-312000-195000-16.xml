		<content> The Junior Savers scheme,was intended 
 to attract the customers of the future
            Mr.Jenkins felt that the   
 role of the Halifax Building Society  
 in Fleur-de-lys,was to provide        
 services for the local people to save 
 and to receive interest on their money
 and to lend money to enable them to   
 buy their own homes,and repay the     
 money over a long period.He told us   
 that the building society was a       
 uniquely British organisation,and was 
 by law a non-profit making instition. 
 Mr. Jenkins told us that his 5 staff  
 dealt with 60 people daily plus a lot 
 of others by telephone or by post.His 
 insurance services covered buildings, 
 contents,motor cars and peoples lives.
 The building society was also         
 computerized.
