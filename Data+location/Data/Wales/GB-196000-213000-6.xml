		<content> Hanton, Deeplake, Cook's, Black Backs,
 Have-a-Care and Millin BRIDGES are on 
 Community Boundaries. All are over    
 Millin Brook or its tributaries except
 Hanton which is across a stream from a
 spring on Old Oven Farm, known locally
 as Green Lake. Have-a-Care may be so  
 named because Baron de Rutzen, a local
 landowner, shouted this to a workman  
 during construction. Black Backs is in
 Black Backs Wood and a small area     
 between this Bridge and Have-a-Care is
 known as Boulston Parlour. A field    
 near the river is called Sheep Dock,  
 perhaps a corruption of Shipping Dock 
 where lime was unloaded from boats.   
 The owners of Hanton Farm (2 Tumuli), 
 Cedar House (Tumulus) and Norchard    
 (Earthwork) are paid Â£50 annually to  
 preserve Ancient Monuments on their   
 land, unploughed.
