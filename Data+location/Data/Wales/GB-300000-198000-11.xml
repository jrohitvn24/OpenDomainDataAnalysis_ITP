		<content> Although South Wales is renowned for  
 the almost religious playing of Rugby 
 Union the allocated area does not have
 any Rugby teams or pitches.  In fact, 
 most surprisingly the main sport is   
 golf.  The Mountain Ash Golf Club at  
 Cefnpennar (Ref. 037.004) was opened  
 in 1908 and recently celebrated it's  
 seventy-fifth year.                   
 At the present it has five hundred    
 members and the present club champions
 are Mr. Steven Lewis (Silver Division 
 of Men's Championship) and Mrs. Eileen
 Lewis (Ladies Championship).          
      Abercwmboi has its own Football  
 team and they recently gained         
 promotion into the first division of  
 the Welsh Amateur League.             
     Due to land reclamation a great   
 deal of playing-field space has been  
 gained in Cwmaman.
