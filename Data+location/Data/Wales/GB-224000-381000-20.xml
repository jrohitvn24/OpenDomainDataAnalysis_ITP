 The area has a number of churches and 
 chapels.The christian faith is        
 followed in the                       
 Calvinistic,Presbyterian chapels,or in
 the Churches.There are also Catholic  
 churches as well as the Church of     
 England meeting houses.               
 Recently other forms of worship have  
 made their niche in the local         
 commmunity,mainly the Jehovah         
 witnesses and the Seventh day         
 adventists.These new worshippers have 
 their own meeting places,such as old  
 church houses or community centres.   
 We however found that only a very low 
 % of the young went to chapel or      
 church regularly.
