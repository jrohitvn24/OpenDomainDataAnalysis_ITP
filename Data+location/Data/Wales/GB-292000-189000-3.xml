		<title>03A Kitchen In Ogmore Vale.</title>
		<content>  My kitchen is quite big. We have an  
 automatic washing machine which fits  
 under the units. The fridge is next to
 the sink with the deep fat fryer on   
 top of it. We have a  Rayburn Fire    
 which my mother cooks on and it       
 also heats the radiators. We have an  
 electric toaster and an electric      
 toaster and an electric kettle. We    
 keep bread in a bread bin and put     
 things like tins of food in the wall  
 units. We have a microwave which we   
 use quite a lot. We also have a       
 toasted sandwich maker. We have a     
 breakfast bar and eat our meals in the
 kitchen. Next to the microwave is the 
 coloured television which has remote  
 control.
