		<title>16An Arboreal Study (cont.)</title>
		<content> As we walked along we used a key to   
 increase accuracy and speed e.g.O=Oak 
 Bi=Birch and so on.We were not        
 surprised to find that the three most 
 common species were Oak,Ash and       
 Sycamore.Also,we were not surprised to
 find that the number of Elm trees had 
 been decimated by Dutch Elm Disease.  
 In fact we did not discover one Elm   
 within the boundary of our block.After
 a thorough examination of the woods we
 collated our results and produced the 
 following statistical analysis as a   
 percantile:Oak-26%,Ash-25%,           
 Sycamore-20%,Birch-5%,                
 Sweet Chestnut-5%,Rowan-4%,Hawthorn-3%
 Alder-3%,Aspen-3%,Hazel-2%,Sallow-2%, 
 Holly-1%,Cherry-1%,Yew-1%.            
{                       }There were    
 various other types which amounted to 
 less than 1%.These included-Wych      
 Elm,Field Maple,Spindle etc.          </content>
