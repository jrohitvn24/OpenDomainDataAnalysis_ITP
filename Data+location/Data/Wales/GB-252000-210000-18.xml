		<content> The two nonconformist chapels with the
 largest membership are Bethania and   
 Bethesda, both are Welsh              
 Congregationalist (Annibynwyr in      
 Welsh). Bethania is in Upper Tumble   
 and is the Mother Chapel of Bethesda  
 which is in Lower Tumble. The first   
 communion was held in Bethania on     
 7.9.1800. With so many of the         
 membership coming from the lower part 
 of Tumble it was decided to erect a   
 building for them in 1888. This       
 building is now the Vestry of Bethesda
 Chapel which was opened in 1905. Since
 that date Bethesda (406) has nearly   
 twice the membership of Bethania      
 (278). The joint membership of both   
 chapels far outweigh the memberships  
 of all the other nonconformist chapels
 and St. David's Church. All the       
 services and Sunday School in both    
 chapels are conducted in Welsh.       </content>
