		<content> These are our most popular recreation 
 games:  Lions:A game for as many      
 children as you like.The person who's 
 on it has to try and touch the other  
 children.As he touches them they join 
 the chain.When everyone has joined the
 chain it is the end of the game.      
 Hopscotch: A game for two or more     
 players. Each player has a stone,which
 they throw onto square one.Then they  
 hop up the court touching each square 
 with a foot as they go.Then they pick 
 up their stone and next turn start on 
 the next number in sequence: one,two, 
 three etc. If you miss your number    
 then you miss that go.
