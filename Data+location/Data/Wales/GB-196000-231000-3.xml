 The school is the focal point of the  
 village. It is the only non-licensed  
 building suitable for general use.    
 It is used as a Sunday School, as well
 as for informal meetings and concerts.
 Whislt the children are generally     
 taught through the English language,  
 the children who have Welsh as a first
 language are taught through that      
 language on an individual basis.      
 all of the children are taught welsh, 
 be it to varying degrees of           
 attainment.                           
 the basic education is formal to      
 ensure a grasp of the fundamentals.   
 But, a wide scope is provided.        
 Due to its small size, its future is  
 now under debate, and will probably   
 close in 2 to 3 years
