		<content> Our area of Llanelli is very low with 
 many areas actually lying below sea   
 level.This has resulted in areas of   
 marshland and large areas of          
 uncultivated non-woodland vegetation. 
 In some cases the land has been       
 developed to accomodate large         
 industrial complexes such as Trostre  
 Tinplate Works and the Texaco Chemical
 Works,in other cases roads and        
 railways have been driven through the 
 grassland but most of it has been left
 untouched.                            
 The residential areas have been built 
 on the slightly higher ground-between 
 30m and 46m above sea level.
