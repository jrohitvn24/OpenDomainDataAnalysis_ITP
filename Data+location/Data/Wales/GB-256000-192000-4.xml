		<content> The older houses are easily identified
 being built of locally quarried stone,
 Pennant Sandstone,and having slate    
 roofs.Large gardens are a feature of  
 many of them,enabling the residents to
 be self-sufficient in vegetables and  
 fruit and creating an interest which  
 has resulted in a very large and      
 active gardening society.             
 Newer houses are of brick construction
 with cement tiled roofs.The smaller   
 sites on which they are built are     
 indicative of modern suburban develop-
 ment and rising land costs.Over 90 per
 cent of houses in the area are        
 privately owned with a small Council- 
 owned development in this village and 
 also in Three Crosses and Upper Killay
 villages nearby.
