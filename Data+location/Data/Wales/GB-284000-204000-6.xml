 THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF UNEMPLOYMENT  
 IN THE VILLAGE BECAUSE THE LOCAL      
 COLLIERY CLOSED IN 1984. A FEW YEARS  
 AGO THE ALUMINIUM FACTORY AT RESOLVEN 
 CLOSED AND MANY OF OUR FATHERS BECAME 
 UNEMPLOYED.                           
{IT HAS AFFECTED THE SHOPS AND PUBS AS 
{PEOPLE HAVEN'T A LOT OF MONEY TO SPEND
{IT HAS ALSO MADE PEOPLE'S HOMES VERY  
{UNHAPPY. SOME PEOPLE HAVE MOVED TO    
{DIFFERENT AREAS AND SOME HAVE EVEN    
{GONE TO SOUTH AFRICA.                 
 PEOPLE THAT ARE UNEMPLOYED HAVE TO GO 
 WITHOUT LOTS OF THINGS SUCH AS        
 HOLIDAYS AND LESS PRESENTS AT         
 CHRISTMAS,EASTER AND AT BIRTHDAYS.    
        IT HAS AFFECTED LOTS OF        
 PEOPLE IN CWMGWRACH.
