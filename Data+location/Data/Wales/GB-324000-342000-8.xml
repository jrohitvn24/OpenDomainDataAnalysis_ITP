		<title>08THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school looks like a church and the
 front looks like a greenhouse.The     
 staffroom looks quite modern on the   
 inside but on the outside it looks    
 old.There are 75 full time children   
 and 10 part time nursery.Ther are four
 teachers 3 full time and 1 part       
 time.On our Eisteddfod day at school  
 Mr.Elfed Morris came to present the   
 Gwernydd shield.That is Garth School  
 now,but what about it's history.At one
 time Garth School boys &amp; girls were   
 not allowed to play on the same       
 yard,and they had to line up          
 seperately to march into the          
 classroom.Written in a log book was   
 that it had been established in       
 January 1873 which was 112 years      
 ago.In a nearby schools log book it   
 said that a new school was opened in  
 Garth on the 15th of March 1872 which 
 was 113 years ago.                    </content>
