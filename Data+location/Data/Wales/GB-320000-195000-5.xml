  researched by Liane Davies           
                                       
      The boys could attend boys clubs 
 and snooker,billiard halls.It was     
 common to see children playing in the 
 streets because there were no playing 
 areas,and there was very little       
 traffic in the streets.               
                                       
 Q.What was the standard of medical    
 care like?                            
                                       
    Medical care was very poor,because 
 all types of treatment had to be paid 
 for unless you were too poor,then you 
 received treatment under the Means    
 Test which meant people came to visit 
 your home to find out your financial  
 state and if it was below poverty     
 standard you would be granted free    
 treatment.                            </content>
