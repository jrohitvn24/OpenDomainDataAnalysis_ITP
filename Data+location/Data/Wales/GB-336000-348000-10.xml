		<content> There is one primary (infants and     
 juniors) school called Isycoed to the 
 east of the area.It is an old building
 but has an additional "mobile"        
 classroom in the playground.There are 
 children attending.                   
 There is an Adult Training Centre in  
 the middle of the estate where older  
 youths who are slow to acquire        
 academic skills do extra              
 learning.Those children in the other  
 parts of the area attend St.Deiniol's 
 Primary School (Marchwiel),Gwenfro    
 Primary (Wrexham).Younger ones attend 
 Caia Park Nursery school in           
 Wrexham, and those over eleven years  
 of age attend St.David's School, or   
 one of the other Schools outside our  
 designated block.
