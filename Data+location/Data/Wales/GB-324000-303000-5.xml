		<content>     John Naylor, owner of Leighton    
 Hall, planted the woodlands and       
 landscaped the estate in the 1850"s.  
 Some exotic trees were planted in     
 small groups in the forests. Today 80%
 of the trees are coniferous, mainly   
 Douglas fir and larch. One of the     
 Grand Fir Trees is the largest in     
 Great Britain, 170ft. high.           
{The Redwood Grove}                    
   The "Charles Ackers" Redwood Grove  
 is now the property of the Royal      
 Forestry Society. The 33 trees were   
 brought over from California as       
 seedlings in pots in 1858. The name   
 Sequoia sempervirens honours a famous 
 Cherokee Chief, and sempervirens means
 "always living". It is difficult to   
 kill off the Redwoods. The bark will  
 not burn easily - it is soft, spongy  
 and thick.Fallen trees throw vertical 
 shoots from the trunk.                </content>
