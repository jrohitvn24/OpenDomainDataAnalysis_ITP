		<title>19LAUGHARNE'S SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> Laugharne has a noticeably lower rate 
 of referrals to Carmarthen's geriatric
 specialist, and there are very few    
 residents in local Old Peoples' Homes.
 No children have been taken into care 
 although one or two cases may involve 
 Social Workers.  People are, today,   
 relatively affluent and well-housed,  
 although about 20 children receive    
 free dinners in the Primary school and
 in the District 60% of Council tenants
 get Rent Rebates.  There have been    
 only 2 suicides in the past few years.
 Laugharne Civic Trust Society (member-
 ship 180) tries to conserve the peace 
 and beauty of Laugharne by objecting  
 to extensions of caravan-sites, amuse-
 ment arcades and such like develop-   
 ments, also to filling in of the creek
 on the salt-marsh which is changing   
 the maritime character of the estuary.
 The Society has surveyed 22 footpaths.</content>
