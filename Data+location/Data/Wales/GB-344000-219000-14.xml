		<content>  This is an area of natural beauty and
 because of this there has been very   
 little change or building over the    
 last thirty years.                    
  The woodland is both coniferous and  
 deciduous and there are tracts of     
 bracken where small sections of trees 
 have been cleared.                    
  The River Monnow flows gently between
 rolling hills and farmlands.          
  The whole area appears slow-moving   
 and peaceful.                         
  The Community Council intends taking 
 part in a survey of the local flora   
 and fauna.The farmers have been under 
 some criticism for heavy spraying in  
 the past,though this has now been     
 reduced.The survey will detail any    
 effects of the spraying.
