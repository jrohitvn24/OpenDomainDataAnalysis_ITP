		<content>{ The area is served by a County       
{Primary Infant and Junior School.}It  
 was built in 1953 to serve a wide     
 catchment area.Pupils are transported 
 from E.Williamston,Broadmoor and      
 Redberth in the east;and Milton and   
 W.Williamston in the West.It is a     
 feeder school to Greenhill Comprehen_ 
 sive,Tenby.A new influx into the area 
 helped numbers increase to 126.The    
 staff include{Headteacher Mr.E.K.Owen 
{D.Head Mrs.J.Morris,Mrs.P.Stubbs,Miss 
{B.Wilkins and Mr.J.McInally.}2 mobile 
 classrooms have been added recently.  
  Making ends meet in Education in 1985
 is difficult.Savage cuts in capitation
 allowances have been offset by        
 tremendous financial support by       
 parents and friends,and has allowed   
 the Headmaster to spend more on the   
 school in the past 3 years than the   
 Authority has allocated to the school.</content>
