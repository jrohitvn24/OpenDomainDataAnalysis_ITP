		<content> One topic which often causes problems 
 in the area is language.Both Welsh and
 English are used in everyday life by  
 many people although English is the   
 main language in Bangor.In Gwynedd as 
 a whole,however,63% of the population 
 can speak Welsh.                      
 The County Council has adopted a      
 bilingual policy which extends most   
 extensively into its schools.Of the 7 
 primary schools in the city 5 are     
 bilingual,1 is a Welsh medium school  
 and 1(the Catholic school) has very   
 little Welsh taught there.Of the 2    
 secondary schools one is a Welsh      
 medium school,Ysgol Tryfan,whilst the 
 other,Friars School,is bilingual but  
 with the emphasis on English medium   
 teaching.                             
 Most of the commercial life of the    
 area is conducted in English.
