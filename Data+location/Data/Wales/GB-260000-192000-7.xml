		<content> Whenever the fair is on the Recreation
 Ground, I go! I love the colour and   
 noise,the helter skelter and dodgems, 
 and the hot dogs and candyfloss. The  
 Sugar Loop rocks gently at first, then
 swoops into the sky until you are     
 dizzy.                                
 The circus comes once a year with     
 beautiful horses and jolly clowns. We 
 entertain our parents with plays at   
 school. My favourite was the "Bumbles 
 of Mumbles". My sister was in the     
 Guides' pantomime and my brother was  
 in the Gang Show. We go to plays in   
 the Taliesin Theatre at the           
 University. I saw an exciting         
 production of "Peter Pan" by the West 
 Glamorgan Youth Company. We used to go
 to the cinema, but now it is a Bingo  
 Hall. My sister went to a Pop Concert 
 and stayed out all night.
