		<content> A Cwmbran Pensioner complains that    
 Court Farm's Roads look as though they
 have been fired at by 25 lbs.shells   
 and Oak Street is like a German Mine- 
 field.He says that the Highway's      
 Inspector must fly in a helicopter    
 above the clouds.Because they claim   
 such high expenses councillors should 
 take off their jackets and mend the   
 roads.                                
{WHEELIES-EXPERIMENT.}Cwmbran wishes to
 do away with plastic refuse bags which
 animals rip open,scattering rubbish.  
 Instead,plastic bins on wheels are    
 being tried.Residents are delighted as
 neighbourhoods are much cleaner.
