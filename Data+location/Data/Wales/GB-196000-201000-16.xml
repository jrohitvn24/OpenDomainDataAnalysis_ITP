		<title>16A COSHESTON WIFE'S DAY</title>
		<content>    I usually get up at 7.30,make the  
 breakfast and take my children to     
 school, one to the comprehensive      
 school in Pembroke,the other to the   
 village school.Then I start cleaning  
 the house.Most Cosheston wives have   
 washing machines,tumble driers and    
 vacuum cleaners to help them.Nearly   
 everyone in the village has a         
 car,because without one,life would be 
 difficult for shopping.The only bus   
 service is the school bus.            
    I have a break at lunchtime after  
 which I drive to Pembroke Dock for my 
 shopping.Then I pick the children up  
 from school and cook the evening      
 meal.There is not much to do in the   
 village but in the evenings we either 
 watch T.V. or go to the pub for a     
 quiet drink.I usually go to bed at    
 about 10.30pm.                        
                                       </content>
