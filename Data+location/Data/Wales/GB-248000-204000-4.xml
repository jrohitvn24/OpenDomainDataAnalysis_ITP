		<content> Mr.Daniels is 77 years old and has tea
 in bed at 5:45am and is up by 6.Before
 breakfast he likes two open coal fires
 and says that he would never have     
 central heating.For breakfast he      
 usually eats cornflakes but sometimes 
 has bacon.Later he walks to the local 
 store/Post office for his newspapers. 
 He always takes the Western Mail.He   
 enjoys breakfast TV and               
 crosswords.Dinner is at 11:30 after   
 which he sometimes goes to town with  
 his wife.Unlike many other older      
 residents he owns a car.This is an    
 advantage as bus services have been   
 decreased.Evenings are spent watching 
 TV or listening to classical music. He
 watches S4C but dislikes programmes   
 from North Wales,as regional dialects 
 differ.He enjoys comedy and most      
 sports.After a 'cup of cocoa' he goes 
 to bed about 10pm.                    </content>
