		<title>12 POEM : WHO REALLY CARES?</title>
		<content>{When he was young}he had plenty to    
         look forward to,              
 A lot of active things to do,         
 Working alongside his fellow miners,  
{Sharing their hardships and sorrows.  
 He visited friends and relatives to   
     say hello and have a laugh or two.
 Then, in the summer, he'd go on       
     holiday with his wife and children
{The highlight of his working year.    
 While doing all these things he kept  
         in good health.               
{He became older,}as his youth passed  
         away                          
 His face wrinkled as he gained        
        {experience of life            
{He became ill;}unable to go out-      
        {isolated                      
 There is no future ahead of him now.  
 With friends and relatives gone,      
 He has to rely on others              
{But who is there; Who really cares?   </content>
