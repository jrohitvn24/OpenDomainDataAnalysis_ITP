		<content>Relics of the past still exist in the  
town.  Some can't be taken away and    
remain as a reminder of the times.     
1. Ice House Bedwellty House.          
   This was discovered by a team of    
boys working for Community Industry in 
Bedwellty Park.  They were using the   
Bell House as a cabin and discovered   
the Ice House immediately beneath it in
excellent condition.  It emphasised the
fact that at one time Bedwellty House  
lived and entertained well.            
2. Dukes Table.                        
   To be found to the north of Trefil. 
It is a man made mound surrouded by a  
bench seat at the side of a spring used
by the Duke of Beaufort and partly to  
eat lunch when they were hunting the   
moors.
