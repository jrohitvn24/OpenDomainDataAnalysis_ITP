		<title>14SUNDAY SCHOOL SURVEY</title>
		<content>   We carried out a school survey to   
 find out children's attitudes towards 
 Church and Sunday School.  We         
 discovered that only 22% of the       
 children attend Sunday School, whilst 
 41% have never been and 37% used to go
 but have given up.  Nineteen per cent 
 of parents attend Church (see graph   
 page 15); 78% of parents and 91% of   
 grandparents used to attend when they 
 were children.                        
   We asked the Vicar of Holy Trinity  
 Church if he knew why less people     
 attended Church these days.  He said  
 that according to Parish records, the 
 number of people attending regularly  
 hasn't changed much over the last 50  
 years.  He thinks that, as people get 
 older, they only remember the big     
 occasions and, in fact, most people   
 who say they went, only went once or  
 twice a year.                         </content>
