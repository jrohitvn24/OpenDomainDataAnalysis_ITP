		<content> 1.{PIGEON KEEPING:}there are many     
 pigeon fanciers in the village, with  
 extensive lofts in the gardens        
 2.{CHOIRS:}choral singing is very     
 popular. There are two choirs, for men
 and women respectively, but it is the 
 male voice choir that has the highest 
 status. Weekly choir practices are    
 well attended.                        
 3.{SCRAMBLING}The open pasture land,  
 the grassed over coal tips, and the   
 railway embankments provide motor     
 cyclists with much opportunity to     
 practice rough riding. Tracks scarred 
 across the hills by these riders are  
 evident. The practitioners range from 
 young boys of 8 to a grandfather.     
 4.{BINGO}bingo sessions are held in   
 the community centre which is in      
 Danycoed and outside the block, but   
 they are popular with Tonmawr people.
