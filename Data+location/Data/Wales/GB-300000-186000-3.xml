		<title>03TONYREFAIL'S BY-PASS</title>
		<content> An engineer and surveyor who works on 
 the new road came to the school to    
 tell us some thing about the new road.
 In the winter,he explained,there are  
 about 100 men working on the new      
 By-pass and in the summer there are   
 about 300 men.He said the men work as 
 quietly as possible and try not to    
 make too much mess. If the earth is   
 dry they must spray water on it to    
 stop the dust rising.                 
   He also told us he is hoping some   
 cars  will be using the new road      
 underneath the new Francis Street     
 bridge by July 1985.About christmas   
 time he is hoping to finish the new   
 road so it will be in full use in     
 January 1986.                         
   This road is the most importent     
 thing happening in and around         
 Tonyrefail today.
