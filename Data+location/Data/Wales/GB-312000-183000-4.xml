		<title>04View from Twyn Garwa Rise.</title>
		<content> From the top of Twyn Garwa rise a     
 splendid view of the Caerphilly area  
 can be observed.   The built up and   
 agricultural areas stretch out        
 unobstructed for miles.   The farms   
 which can be viewed are modern in both
 structure and design which is         
 interesting to note.   One of the     
 farms, Cwm, was once a school but when
 the school closed the building was    
 renovated and turned into a farm which
 is still worked today.   There are    
 also mines in the area.   These are   
 not shaft mines but drift mines, and  
 one of the old disused drifts goes    
 under the main road.   The stone which
 covers the entrance is visible in     
 drought conditions.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
