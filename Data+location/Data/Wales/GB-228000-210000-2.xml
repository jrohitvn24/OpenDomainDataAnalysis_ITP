		<content> Laugharne developed from a Celtic     
 hillfort "Abercorran".  In Llandawke  
 Church is a gravestone with mixed     
 Ogham/Roman inscription. In the Church
 of St Martin are bones of the Beaker  
 people found locally, a 10th Century  
 Celtic cross and an oriel window with 
 the head of Edward III, about 1350, in
 the nave. Laugharne Castle has early  
 13th Century towers and Tudor         
 additions. In about 1307 Charter given
 by Sir Gwydo de Brione to Laugharne   
 Corporation, document extant.  Also 2 
 original documents detailing the 1568 
 Hundred Court Meeting in "le guilde   
 hall" and the "Book of Survey 1592 of 
 the Castle Lordship and Manor of      
 Tallaugharn". The Custom Officers Book
 of 1817 lists cargoes to Ireland from 
 Laugharne as bark, grain, butter and  
 cheese.  Stone was taken out and coal 
 brought in before lorries were used.  </content>
