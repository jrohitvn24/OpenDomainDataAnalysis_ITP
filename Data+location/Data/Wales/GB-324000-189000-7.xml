		<content> Jobs around Risca are very scares.    
 Most people find it very hard to find 
 a job, but people who don't find a job
 go on the dole (the dole is where     
 people collect money of the social    
 security)                             
  However,there are large firms not to 
 far away. Thats why most people,have  
 to travel to and from work. After the 
 age of 60 (women) and 65 (men) you can
 retire from your work.Then you recieve
 and old age pension.                  
  Some women don't mind not having a   
 job because they  have young children 
 to look after. The people which have  
 children over five is able to go to   
 work because their children go to     
 school.                               
 Firms sell the products to  different 
 places like shops, chemists, garages, 
 they then sell it to their customers  
 and make a profit.                    </content>
