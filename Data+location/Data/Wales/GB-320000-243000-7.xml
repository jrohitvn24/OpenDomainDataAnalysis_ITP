		<title>07FARMING AROUND CLYRO.</title>
		<content>     The farms around Clyro are of two 
 distinct types. The hill farms        
 bordering the Wye Valley are small    
 family run farms depending mainly on  
 sheep. The farms of the broad valley  
 floor are larger farm estates with a  
 mixture of arable and livestock.      
     Typical of the small family farms 
 is the farm at {Tirmynach.}The farm is
 worked by a single family. Mr. Awford 
 farms the land with the help of his   
 wife and his sons, who are still of   
 school age.                           
      {Tirmynach,}is 97 acres in total.
 Thirteen acre are generally used for  
 the growing of corn, mainly barley.   
 The rest of the land is used for      
{grazing, silage or hay.}The land is   
 grazed by{200 ewes and their lambs,   
{nine rams, a horse and 32 young       
{cattle.}One sheep dog helps with the  
 rounding up of the sheep.             </content>
