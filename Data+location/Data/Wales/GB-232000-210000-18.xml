		<title>18LLANSTEFFAN AREA: SPORT</title>
		<content> We make our own enjoyment. We have two
 soccer clubs, one in each village, and
 Llansteffan has cricket and tennis    
 clubs. Badminton is played in the     
 Memorial Hall. A few people have      
 boats. Angling is probably the most   
 popular sport among men and boys,     
 mostly on the rivers for trout, sewin,
 and salmon. Llanybri Wildfowlers and  
 Conservation Club exists chiefly to   
 regulate shooting on the Taf estuary. 
 Swimming at Llansteffan is only safe  
 around high tide because of the       
 treacherous current so some people go 
 to Carmarthen Leisure Centre pool. A  
 handful of people go horse riding.    
 Snooker is played in the Ben Harries  
 Institute, and darts and pool in the  
 pubs. Holiday activities include a    
 mini-marathon, terrier-racing on the  
 Morfa, folk dancing and a car treasure
 hunt.                                 </content>
