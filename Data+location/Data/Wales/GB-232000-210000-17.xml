		<content> Watching television and listening to  
 radio are the commonest leisuretime   
 entertainment. Many people have record
 players too and some have videos. The 
 nearest cinema is 25 miles away at    
 Llanelli. At Christmas Llansteffan WI 
 put on a pantomime, and each village  
 has a Christmas tree and carolsinging.
 In summer each village has a carnival 
 with fancy dress competitions and     
 chidren's sports. Llansteffan keeps up
 its old custom of electing a          
 mock-mayor. Occasionally we book a    
 small touring theatre to perform in   
 the Castle, and sometimes we have a   
 concert by a Welsh male-voice choir in
 aid of charity. The occasional disco  
 and barbecue are held on The Green or 
 the beach. Each chapel has an annual  
 Cwrdd Mawr (Big Meeting) and on Good  
 Friday all the chapels combine in a   
 Gymanfa Ganu (singing festival).      </content>
