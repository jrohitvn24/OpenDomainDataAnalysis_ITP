		<content>    It was discovered that most of the 
 people interviewed believed in God,and
 only a small percentage did not not   
 believe in God.We found out that most 
 of the people were Methodists. 50%    
 prayed at home, 30% prayed in chapel  
 or in church,the rest did not pray at 
 all.The residents did not travel far  
 to worship.                           
    The people of the area enjoyed     
 ceremonies performed by the children  
 during Christmas and Thanksgiving.    
    By studying the answers given we   
 believe that the number of worshipers 
 has declined in the area over the     
 years.
