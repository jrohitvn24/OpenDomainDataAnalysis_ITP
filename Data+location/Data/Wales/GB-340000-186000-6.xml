  He has renovated old cars for the    
 famous,like Sir Richard Llewellyn and 
 Lord Raglan.He said the most difficult
 part when renovating is the dry       
 stage,this means stripping the car of 
 paint,spraying and bolting it back    
 together,bit by bit.He often has to   
 send abroad for parts which are hard  
 to come by in this country.           </content>
