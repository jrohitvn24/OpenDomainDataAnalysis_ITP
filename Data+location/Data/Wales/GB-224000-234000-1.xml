		<title>01The Bwlch-y-groes area.</title>
		<content>  We live in a rural area in North     
 Pembrokeshire.It is a hilly region    
 and there are coniferous and decidious
 trees on the slopes of the river      
 valleys.Most of the people are        
 concerned with agriculture and most of
 the farms are dairy farms.They sell   
 milk,raise calves,grow barley and make
 silage.Most of the farms are          
 small,usually under 100 acres.Most of 
 the people speak Welsh but newcomers  
 speak English.There are two public    
 houses,the Fox and Hounds and the     
 Falls Inn which also has rooms for    
 guests.There are two Anglican churches
 and two Welsh chapels.In their spare  
 time people attend the Women's        
 Institute,Merched y Wawr and the local
 choir.There are two hamlets-Star and  
 Llwyndrain.Some people travel out of  
 the area to work.{
