		<content>    Most of the land lies between 150  
 metres and is disected by steeply     
 sloping river valleys which are mostly
 wooded. The overall impression of the 
 area is the predominance of grass.    
 Because of the shorter growing season 
 the farmers in this area do not       
 attempt to grow cereal crops. Instead 
 the grassland is improved where       
 possible by liming the acid soil,     
 spreading fertiliser and re-seeding.  
 The grass is used to graze sheep and  
 cattle. The highest areas on the      
 slopes of Moelfre Isaf are left unsown
 but are enclosed with fences in order 
 to graze livestock. Farmers in the    
 area are beginning to take advantage  
 of grants from the{E.E.C.}to begin    
 improving this upland pasture. Farms  
 in the area depend entirely on the    
 raising of livestock - sheep and      
 cattle - for wool and meat.           </content>
