 tourists, particulaly in the summer   
 months. Most visitors come because of 
 the excellent watersports facilities  
 (easy launching and unloading of boats

 moorings, chandlery and repair shop,  
 sheltered water, regattas and races,  
 picturesque places to visit by water).
 Others come for the quiet beauty of   
 the landscape or to study the birds,  
 flowers etc. Families with children   
 appreciate the fact that there is safe
 bathing and plenty of sand, rock pools
 and space. There are 3 hotel/guest

 with 230 more beds in self-catering   
 accomodation. The holiday houses and  
 flats are sited in among the          
 residential housing. There are no camp
