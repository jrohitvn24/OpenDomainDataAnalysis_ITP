		<content>   The 2 most important roads in the   
 block are the{A48,}which now by-passes
 Cowbridge and the {B4270 }linking     
 Cowbridge with Pontyclun. This road is
 especially busy on Tuesdays, market   
 day in Cowbridge.                     
   There is little public transport,   
 possibaly because the Vale is a       
 relatively prosperous area and most   
 families have at least one car.There  
 are a few village bus routes but most 
 buses run West-East along the{A48.    
   The local railway was opened in 1865
 and closed in 1951. The nearest B.R   
 station is  Bridgend. There is an     
 international airport at Rhoose.      
   The third year pupils at Cowbridge  
 School who compiled this survey live  
 in Cowbridge and the Vale. Most come  
 to School by bus from outlying        
 villages.{Thanks to  C. Flower and
