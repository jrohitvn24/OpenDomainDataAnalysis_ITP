		<content>  The predominant language of the area 
 is Welsh, though in recent years more 
 English speaking people have moved to 
 the area. All children of primary     
 school age are taught Welsh and the   
 subject,like maths and English,is     
 compulsary in the first 5 years of    
 secondary school.In a survey in May   
 1985 6.3% of the pupils in the first  
 few years at secondary school         
 considered themselves learners of     
 Welsh,the remainder spoke Welsh as a  
 first language or were fluent in it as
 a second language. All children have  
 the choice of doing their school work 
 in either English or Welsh.Of the 92  
 children in the 1st form at Ysgol     
 Botwnnog 11 chose to do their written 
 work in English.                      
  Welsh is used not only in the school 
 but in everyday life,chapel,church,wo-
 rk,commerce and in daily conversation.</content>
