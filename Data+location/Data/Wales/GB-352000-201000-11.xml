		<title>11BROCKWEIR VILLAGE TODAY</title>
		<content>   Brockweir village is inhabited main-
 ly by immigrants,there are very few   
 locally born residents.There is no    
 local industry apart from a family run
 riding school and a small Oil distrib-
 ution business.The village is a       
 'dormitory'as most residents travel   
 out to work in Chepstow,Newport,Bris- 
 tol and Monmouth.                     
     Village life is centred on the    
 Mackenzie hall where the playgroup is 
 held twice a week.There is a weekly   
 Keep fit class,monthly whist drives,  
 monthly  Parish council meetings and  
 Womens Institute.Various fund raising 
 events such as jumble sales,Flea Mark-
 ets,dances and discos are also held in
 the hall.The Moravian church near the 
 river was founded in 1831 and services
 are held on Sunday evenings and Sunday
 school in the morning is attended by  
 about 20-30 children.                 </content>
