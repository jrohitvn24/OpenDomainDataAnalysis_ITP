		<title>02AFON BRADLEY FARM</title>
		<content> THERE ARE 8 FARMS IN OUR AREA. WE     
 CHOSE AFON BRADLEY FARM BECAUSE IT WAS
 ONE OF THE NEAREST TO GET TO.IT IS    
 MANAGED BY A MOTHER AND HER SON. THEY 
 WORK HARD. THEY KEEP 350 SHEEP AND    
 HAVE ALSO JUST HAD 500 LAMBS.THEY DONT
 GROW ANY CROPS, ALL THE FARM IS       
 GRASSLAND.THEY ALSO HAVE 7 COWS AND   
 ONE BULL.THE FARM BELONGS TO THE      
 FAMILY NOW, BUT LIKE A LOT OF THE LAND
 AROUND HERE, IT USED TO BELONG TO THE 
 CHIRK CASTLE ESTATE.THERE ARE 7 FIELDS
 AND ALTOGETHER ABOUT 120 ACRES.ALL THE
 BUILDINGS ARE IN GOOD CONDITION.THE   
 FARM IS LOOKED AFTER VERY WELL.THE    
 FARMHOUSE ITSELF IS ABOUT 200 YEARS   
 OLD.WHEN THE LAMBS ARE BIG ENOUGH,THEY
 WILL BE TAKEN TO BE SOLD AT EITHER    
 RUTHIN MARKET OR OSWESTRY MARKET.
