		<title>04Housing in Dale</title>
		<content> The main streets of Dale village form 
 a rectangle.Most of the houses are    
 situated on the North and South sides 
 of this.The sea is close to the       
 Eastern side and the houses in this   
 part of the village are at least 100  
 years old,built with thick stone walls
 and small windows.Most are cement     
 rendered and colour washed.They were  
 originally owned by the Dale Castle   
 Estate,but some have been sold.Further
 away from the sea,the roads are lined 
 with newer houses:council bungalows   
 and houses;terraced and semi-detached 
 houses built about 1956 as married    
 quarters for the R.N.Air Station at   
 Kete.Of the 115 houses in Dale,36 are 
 holiday homes.Outside the village,most
 houses are traditional farm-houses.   
{Dale Castle},the largest house,is     
 privately occupied.
