 Hengoed Fawr is similar t0 all the    
 other farms in our block .Being near a
 town it grows some vegetables for the 
 local market, but concentrates mostly 
 on dairy cattle. On the farm we find  
 25 acres of barley, 12 acres of maize 
 (winter animal feed), 2 acres of      
 potatoes, 2 acres of swedes and 163   
 acres of grass. There is a herd of 90 
 dairy cattle, which is milked twice   
 daily. There are also 90 calves on the
 farm, which are kept until they become
 milking cattle. The older dairy cattle
 are then sold, to be replaced by      
 younger ones which have been bred on  
 the farm. During the winter 200 sheep 
 are kept. These are sold  in the      
 spring.
