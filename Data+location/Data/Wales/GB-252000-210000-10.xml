		<content> With the increase in population after 
 the opening of the Coal Mine and with 
 only one village pub an imposing      
 Workingmen's Club called the "Great   
 Mountain" was built and opened in     
 1893. The Club is now one of three in 
 the block. It has a large membership  
 where people can enjoy an evening out 
 either playing a game of bingo, cards,
 snooker, pool, darts or dancing to    
 disco music. The Club is also the     
 headquarters of the Tumble Rugby      
 Football Club.                        
   The other two clubs in the block are
 the Cwmmawr Workingmen's Club and the 
 Upper Tumble Social Club. Both these  
 clubs provide the same amenities as   
 the Great Mountain Club, and they also
 are well attended. The Great Mountain 
 Club is also the meeting place of the 
 Evergreen Club, a club for Old Age    
 Pensioners.                           </content>
