		<title>10SUNDAY IN COEDPOETH</title>
		<content>      The area around{Coedpoeth}could  
 at one time boast a strong religious  
 following as the number of places of  
 worship in the area would suggest.    
 However, by today the places of       
 worship are very poorly attended      
 having only somwhere in the region of 
 15 to 30 worshippers each per service.
                                       
      The public houses on the other   
 hand,slightly outnumbered by the      
 chapels compensate by being able to   
 boast a larger and more dedicated     
 following.They open in the afternoon  
 from 12 noon until 3 p.m. and again   
 from 6 p.m. till 11 p.m.in the        
 evening.The majority of the male      
 clientele preferring the locally      
 brewed{Wrexham Lager}at approximately 
 70p a pint.
