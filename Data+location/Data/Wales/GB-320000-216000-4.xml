		<title>04THE CHURCH</title>
		<content>{St. Edmunds}is the name of the        
 Church in Crickhowell. It was first   
 built in{1303}and it is the oldest    
 used building in the area. On a Sunday
 18 people pray at 8.30 a.m. and 45    
 people at 10.00 a.m. About 12 people  
 pray at 6 p.m. Altogether in          
 Crickhowell about 100 people out of   
 1600 people ,about 6 per cent, attend 
 one or other of the various churches. 
 A hundred years ago the churches would
 have been full.                       
 Most of the alterations were made     
 under the Victorians.                 
 The church has a{clock}in the tower   
 which has two faces and not four. This
 is because the man who paid for it had
 a{quarrel}with the townspeople and    
 would not allow a face of the clock to
 be put so that it could be seen from  
 the town.                             
                                       </content>
