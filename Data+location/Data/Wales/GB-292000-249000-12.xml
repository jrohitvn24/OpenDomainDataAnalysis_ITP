		<title>12LANDSCAPE   BEULAH - GARTH</title>
		<content> Undulating, mostly grassland, very    
 little arable. Small fields divided   
 mainly by hedges. Some roadside hedges
 being lost due to road widening,mostly
 on A483. Good tree cover, mostly small
 areas of decidous woods,one Forestry  
 Commission conifer plantation near    
 Garth. Some higher land still covered 
 by bracken,though modern cultivation  
 has reduced this.                     
 Old farm houses and buildings blend   
 inconspicuously into landscape, but   
 new,large, farm sheds,recently built  
 for housing animals on some farms tend
 to be eyesores at present. Possibly,  
 time and the growth of trees around   
 them will improve their appearance.   
 Powys County Council Highways also    
 tend to make an eyesore out of a large
 lay-by on A483, which they use as a   
 dump for all manner of road building  
 materials.                            </content>
