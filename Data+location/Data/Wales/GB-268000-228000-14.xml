		<title>14FARMING_SILAGE MAKING</title>
		<content> In the Llangadog area farmers make    
 silage for winter feeding for their   
 dairy herds. Silage is made this way. 
 In June the grass is cut.It is left   
 on the ground for a short while to    
 wilt and then the forage harvester    
 comes along, picks up the grass with  
 its spikes,cuts it into little shreds 
 and then blows it into a big trailer  
 that is pulled behind it.The full     
 trailer load is then unloaded at the  
 silo pit back at the farm where a     
 tractor with a buckrake pushes the    
 grass into the pit.The tractor then   
 drives over it to roll it tight so    
 that the juice runs out.More and more 
 grass is piled on top. When the pit is
 full it is covered with a plastic     
 sheet to keep the air out.Heavy       
 weights are put on top and it is left 
 for a few months until needed for     
 winter feeding for the cattle.        </content>
