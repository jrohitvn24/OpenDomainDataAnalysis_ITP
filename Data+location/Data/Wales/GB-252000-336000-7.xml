		<title>07HOME LIFE IN MORFA BYCHAN</title>
		<content> We are fortunate in Morfa Bychan to   
 have regular deliveries of fresh foods
 from local producers.The meat,fish    
 bread and vegetables are all of very  
 good quality.                         
 This village has a high percentage of 
 elderly people,many of whom rely on   
 frozen and tinned food.The busy mother
 also makes use of her deep-freezer and
 micro-wave oven to prepare family     
 meals quickly.                        
 School children have their lunch at   
 school or they buy chips and snack    
 food in Porthmadog.All the children   
 enjoy chips and cola type drinks.     
 Formal meals are unusual in the busy  
 homes.Family life is often hectic.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
