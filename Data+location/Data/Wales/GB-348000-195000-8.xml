		<title>08OTTER HOLE CAVES,THE SYSTEM</title>
		<content> Otter hole is the biggest cave under  
 St. Arvans and part of Chepstow.3200m 
 has been discovered.The thing that    
 makes Otter Hole distinctive from any 
 other caving system in the world is   
 the tidal mud washed in at high tide  
 by the River Wye, and spread through  
 out the entrance to the cave          
 system.Also some amazing formations   
 of stalagtites and stalagmites have   
 been found in the caves such as in the
 "Hall of 30" and the"Straw chamber".  
 The Straw Chamber got its name        
 from the many stalagtites in the      
 chamber each one hollow like a straw. 
 Otter Hole got its name from an old   
 otter breeding place that was in the  
 original entrance.
