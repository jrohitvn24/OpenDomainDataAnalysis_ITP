		<title>03Gelli Werdd Park, Glanaman.</title>
		<content>     Gelli Werdd Park opened in 1969 on
 the site of the old Gelli Ceidrim     
 Colliery.                             
     Covering approximately twenty     
 acres between the villages of Glanaman
 and Garnant, it is a major feature of 
 the local landscape. Its steep        
 hillside aspect is traversed by a     
 number of gently sloping footpaths,   
 allowing observers fine views of the  
 village and surrounding area.         
     The park includes a children's    
 playground, as well as areas of       
 coniferous and deciduous woodland. Its
 natural character allows trees and    
 wild plants to grow largely           
 undisturbed, providing an important   
 habitat for many species of butterfly.
     The park offers a safe area for   
 studies by the school,and provides the
 local people with an unspoiled        
 environment for their leisure hours.  </content>
