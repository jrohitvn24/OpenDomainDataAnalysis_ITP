		<title>10HOUSING IN HENLLAN</title>
		<content> The spatial growth of Henllan has been
 markedly uneven. The oldest part is on
 the western edge of the village       
 between the church and around the     
 focus of the roads.Here the houses are
 mainly late C19 and consist of small  
 terraces built of local limestone.The 
 steep sided valley to the west stopped
 further expansion in that direction.An
 estate of approx.50 council houses was
 built on the eastern side in the mid  
 C20 but it is since 1970 that there   
 has been a considerable expansion of  
 housing on the eastern side of the    
 village in the form of several private
 housing estates with a mixture of     
 houses and bungalows.The most recent  
 development has been the infilling of 
 smaller plots.
