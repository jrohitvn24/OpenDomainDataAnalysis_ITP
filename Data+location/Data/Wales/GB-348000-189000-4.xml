		<title>04A SCHOOL DAY IN MATHERN.</title>
		<content>    We start school at 9.15 a.m. and   
 finish at 3.30 p.m. for five days     
 every week.                           
    Every morning we have a religious  
 assembly for about half an hour when  
 we sing hymns, say prayers and hear a 
 story told by our headmaster.         
                                       
    At lunch time we can have school   
 dinners or bring a packed lunch to    
 eat.  We have a play-time in the      
 morning and afternoon for about twenty
 minutes.                              
                                       
    When we do our work we sit at      
 tables with about six other children; 
 sometimes we are quiet when we work   
 but usually we are allowed to have a  
 chat with our friends.                
                                       
    Altogether our school is the best  
 school you could wish for.            </content>
