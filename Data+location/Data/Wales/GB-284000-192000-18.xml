		<title>18Mining in Caerau</title>
		<content> Many families are now experiecing     
 difficulties due to the closiure of   
{collieries}in the immediate area.     
{Caerau Colliery}was closed in 1977 and
 many of the miners who worked in that 
 colliery were transferred to{Coegnant 
{colliery}which is lower down the      
 valley. Then recently Coegnant        
 Colliery was closed after a long      
 struggle between the{Union}and the    
{N.C.B. to}keep it open. As a result   
 many of the miners were made redundant
 though some were fortunate enough to  
 find work in factories in Bridgend.   
 Others were transferred to{Saint Johns
{Colliery}in{Maesteg.}However that     
 colliery which is the last in the     
 Llynfi valley is under threat of      
 closure. I this happens{unemployment  
 will be increased and cause even      
 greater problems in the valley.
