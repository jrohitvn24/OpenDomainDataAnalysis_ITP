		<title>04The population of Pontycymer</title>
		<content>  Before the industrial development of 
 the Valley, the population was sparse.
 In 1801 the population numbered only  
 200, scattered about some 25 farms. By
 1861 the population had reached 600,  
 and then came the industrial boom. The
 opening of the mines with increased   
 employment, resulted in a movement of 
 population into the valley and by 1891
 it had reached 7000, rising to a peak 
 of 16000 in 1925. This population     
 increase was obviously the result of a
 great initial influx of immigrant     
 workers and their families chiefly    
 from England and the west country(30%)
 and from other Welsh counties(56%).   
  Although English is the predominant  
 language, many of the older residents 
 speak Welsh and Welsh chapels stil    
 remain. Welsh is taught at the local  
 comprehensive school and welsh junior 
 school in Bridgend and other places.  </content>
