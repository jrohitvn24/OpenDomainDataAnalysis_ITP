		<content> Mrs. Lewis is the post mistress at    
 Stepaside Post Office.  She has a very
 busy week with about 150 people       
 calling to collect pensions and       
 different kinds of insurances.  The   
 people come from Kilgetty to Amroth to
 Wiseman's Bridge.  She told me, Daniel
 Wilde, when my friends and I visited  
 her last week that she has no         
 competition from the Post Office in   
 Kilgetty.  Mrs. Lewis has been working
 in the Office for 33 years and is     
 undecided whether to stay on or not.  
 A young person wearing a mask entered 
 her shop about 4 weeks ago pointed a  
 gun at her and tied her up at the     
 kitchen stove.  The police closed all 
 roads to Pembrokeshire on that day but
 the robber got away.  She gets her    
 sweets and stickers from a wholesaler 
 in Llanelli.  The Post Office used to 
 be a blacksmith's shop.               </content>
