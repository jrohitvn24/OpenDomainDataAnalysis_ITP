		<content>   Although most of the settlement in  
 this area is comprised of individual  
 farms and smallholdings, there has    
 been considerable building in this    
 area in recent years. These new       
 dwellings, conversions and renovations
 house families who choose to live in a
 rural area but work in the towns on   
 the coast. Some of the new buildings  
 are used for holidays and weekend     
 breaks, and are owned by people from  
 Merseyside and Manchester. There are  
 also two static caravan sites and a   
 group of holiday cottages for rent    
 which provide accomodation for        
 holiday-makers in the summer.
