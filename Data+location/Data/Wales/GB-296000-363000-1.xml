		<title>01THE HILLS WEST OF DENBIGH</title>
		<content> The area is composed of rolling hills 
 and valleys, the result of glacial    
 action ranging in height up to approx 
 400m. Farms and cottages are scattered
 throughout the block and agriculture  
 is very important, particularly sheep 
 farming. Farms range in size from 20  
 acres upwards. Many people who live in
 this countryside commute to nearby    
 towns to work, particularly           
 professional people. There are a      
 couple of small villages with general 
 stores. Most inhabitants are Welsh    
 speaking as their first language and  
 proud of their identity. Incomers from
 England are treated in a friendly way.
 Climate is often damp with cold       
 winters but the area is very          
 beautiful, dear and alive.
