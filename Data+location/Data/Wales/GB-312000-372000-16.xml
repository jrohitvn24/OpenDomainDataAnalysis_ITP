		<title>16INTERVIEW OF CAERWYS MAYOR 2</title>
		<content>                                       
 Far less Welsh is spoken now,he could 
 not speak English when he started     
 School and only Welsh was spoken in   
 most homes.                           
   His first memories of Caerwys are of
 the old fairs held in the street where
 sheep,cattle and pigs were penned.    
 Horses were trotted up and down the   
 street whilst inspected for any signs 
 of lameness. This came to an end about
 1920.                                 
   He loved bathing in the pool below  
 what is now the fisheries .He         
 looked forward to his 12th birthday   
 when he could join the institute to   
 play tennis.He cannot understand why  
 the youth of today do not make more   
 use of the tennis courts which are    
 freely available.
