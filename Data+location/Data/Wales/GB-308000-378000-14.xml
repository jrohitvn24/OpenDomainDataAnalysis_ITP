		<title>14EDUCATION IN TRELAWNYD</title>
		<content> The Village School is a Church Aided  
 School, and it is l25 years old.  The 
 building had slowly been deteriorating
 , and in l984 was under threat of     
 closure.  After public meetings and   
 pressure being put upon the           
 Authorities, it was resolved that the 
 school roof would be replaced, and    
 repairs would be made to the          
 Classrooms if the parents would       
 undertake to raise Â£1,000.  This they 
 managed in a matter of months through 
 a variety of fund raising events and  
 donations.  The most lucrative        
 fund-raiser was a Calendar of         
 Trelawnyd Past and Present, and a book
 on Trelawnyd which was arranged by a  
 former pupil of the school. The school
 has 2.5 teachers and 53 pupils from   
 Llanasa, Axton and Trelawnyd.The      
 children receive regular visits from  
 the clergy,and support the Church.    </content>
