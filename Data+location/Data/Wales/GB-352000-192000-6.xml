		<content> The distict council plan to allow     
 property developers to build shops    
 etc. in a part of the town which will 
 close off one of the two entrances to 
 the main car park.The inhabitants of  
 the town are againts this as shown by 
 a petition organised by the Chamber of
 Trade.In an interview with the        
 chairman of the Chamber of Trade,he   
 explained that they{do not object}to  
 the shops being built as long as the  
 traffic flowed smoothly,otherwise     
 people might be discouraged from      
 bringing cars into the town and so    
 trade in the existing shops would     
 suffer,he felt that the Chamber could 
 influence decisions through discussion
 and would do all in their power to    
 retain the characters of Chepstow.
