		<title>04TONMAWR - 1981 CENSUS</title>
		<content> An inspection of the results of the   
{1981 National Census}as applied to the
 Tonmawr area was made with special    
 regard to the kinds and degrees of    
 deprivation experienced by people     
 living in its communities. Generally  
 Tonmawr people were found to have     
 housing of average standard - little  
 overcrowding or missing 'standard'    
 amenities. (e.g. bathrooms, inside    
 toilets.) but they suffered from      
 unemployment to a greater extent than 
 the average for the County, especially
 younger age groups. The community had 
 fewer cars than average, despite being
 relatively isolated.(5 miles from     
 Neath).Yet there are few amenities in 
 the valley. There was a marked lack of
 people in managerial / supervisory    
 roles compared with County average. An
 above average number of families had 3
 generations in the same household.    </content>
