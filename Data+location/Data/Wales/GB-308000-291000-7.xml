		<content> Del Renfrew packaging occupies a      
 modern factory built by the           
 Development Board on the Dyffryn      
 Industrial estate.It manufactures     
 plastic bottles for holding bubble    
 bath etc.The factory employs 65 people
 and manufactures 2,0000 bottles every 
 month.The raw materials are mixed at  
 the factory and then passed through an
 injection mould,where the bottle is   
 formed.The bottles are then printed at
 the factory using a screen-printing   
 technique.After printing the bottles  
 are passed through a hot air tunnel to
 dry.They are then packed in boxes     
 placed on a pallet and shrink wrapped 
 with a sheet of plastic.They are      
 removed from the factory by an        
 arcticulated lorry.At the factory     
 there are offices,rest rooms and      
 canteen facilities which are used by  
 the workforce.                        </content>
