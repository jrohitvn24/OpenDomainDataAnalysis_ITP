		<content> IN Malpas there is one police station 
 At the police station there is one    
 police sergeant and four constables.  
 Our community police constable is call
 ed David Evans. Each policeman works  
 eight hours each day, but they are on 
 call 24 hours every day if they are   
 needed. The head quarters for the     
 police is at CHESTER where they have  
 to report to each day.                
 The sort of work that the police are  
 involved in is: seeing to accidents,  
 investigating any crimes that are     
 committed. If they need extra help    
 they can radio for assistance and     
 extra police constables will arrive   
 from Farndon, Tattenhall or Chester.
