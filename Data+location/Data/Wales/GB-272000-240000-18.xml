		<content> Cil-y-cwm was until recently one of   
 the strongholds of welsh language.    
 During last 10 years however, there   
 has been a rapid decline in number of 
 Welsh speaking inhabitants as large   
 numbers of non welsh speaking people  
 have moved into the area. most are    
 from England, but other nationalities,
 including Dutch,German, and Swedish.  
 In past young people tended to marry  
 Welsh speakers from within area but   
 this is no longer the case. Although  
 there are no monoglot Welsh (i.e.     
 people who speak only Welsh)some of   
 the older people find it easier to    
 converse in Welsh than in English.    
 There is no local dialect. One        
 encouraging factor is that at least 9 
 newcomers are making an attempt to    
 learn the Welsh language.
