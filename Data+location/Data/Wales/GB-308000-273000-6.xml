		<title>06ATTITUDES IN LLANBISTER</title>
		<content>    Attitudes among the residents of   
 LLanbister are as many and varied as  
 the people themselves. Broadly        
 speaking agriculture and education are
 the two local issues most often       
 discussed. Because of concern over    
 education cuts the positive attitude  
 towards the local shool was obvious.  
 Agriculture, from E.E.C. and          
 government policy through to local    
 farming practices, brings comments    
 about the lack of understanding of    
 those not involved together with a    
 resigned acceptance of the "farmers   
 lot".                                 
    Issues of an international or      
 national bias seem to be of less      
 interest.                             
    Traditional and  tolerant would    
 best sum up the general attitudes. One
 topic which tops all others in        
 conversation is the weather.          </content>
