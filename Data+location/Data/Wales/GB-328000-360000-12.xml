		<content> Meadowlea hospital is an old tudor    
 style house set on a hill which caters
 for old age pensioneres in the        
 Penyffordd area.The building itself   
 was originally a private residence    
 but was converted into a T.B.         
 isolation hosptal in about 1950.The   
 hospital is now a geriatrics home     
 whose general aim is to make O.A.P's  
 last years as comfortable as possible.
 Meadowleas has not got the facilies to
 cope with emergencies and the         
 operating theatre and x-ray wards have
 since been shut and turned into other 
 ammenities.The hospital caters for    
 approximately 70 patients of which the
 majority are women.The hospital does  
 not provide a service for local people
 so a surgery is held in an old        
 converted house in the town centre.The
 surgery is held 3 times weekly by     
 doctors from outside the area.1       </content>
