		<title>11Local history. Leighton Hall</title>
		<content>{An interesting visitor.}              
 Today we interviewed Miss Puleston    
 Jones. She taught at our school over  
 50 years ago, and although she went   
 away for a long time, she still       
 remembers a lot about Leighton village
 in those days. She told us that       
 members of the Naylor family of       
 Leighton Hall would come and visit the
 school and inspect the work. Often,   
 pupils were invited to the Hall on    
 special occasions. At Christmas       
 everyone sang carols, and then        
 were given an orange each and a       
 mince-pie as big as a saucer to take  
 home. Miss Puleston Jones said that   
 the Naylor family had many people from
 the village working for them as maids,
 butlers, gardeners, foresters,        
 farmers, chauffeurs, cooks,           
 stonemasons and other occupations.
