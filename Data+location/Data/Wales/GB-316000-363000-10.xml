		<content> The present building dates from the   
 14th century but a carved stone basin 
 found on the site, thought to be the  
 remains of a Norman font, suggests the
 existence of an earlier structure. The
 church is interesting in that it has  
 two naves, only one now being used for
 services. The most impressive feature 
 of the church is the 15th century     
 hammer-beam roof, which has the large 
 carved wooden figure of an angel at   
 either end of the four main beams. The
 roof, regarded as one of the finest of
 its type in the country, was not made 
 originally for this building but is   
 reputed to have been brought here from
 Basingwerk Abbey, near Holywell, after
 the dissolution of the monastery.     
 The church is still in regular use,but
 now the local vicar is responsible for
 a number of parishes and no longer    
 lives in the village.                 </content>
