		<content> There are two means of public         
 transport in our D block.A bus company
 by the name of Thomas Brothers have   
 their main depot in Llangadog and     
 operate a public bus service in the   
 area with a bus travelling through the
 same route about ten times a day.This 
 company also hires coaches for tour   
 throughout the country and even       
 abroad.Their coaches are painted in   
 green and cream colours.There are two 
 request stop railway stations in our D
 block being the ones at Llangadog and 
 Llanwrda.The railway runs from        
 Llanelli to Shrewsbury and is called  
 the central Wales line and is in      
 danger of closure.Trains run in both  
 directions four times during the day.
