		<title>15The Old Railway-27 Years On</title>
		<content>The Old L.N.W.R. line in Abergavenny   
closed in 1958.The route crossed the   
Brecon Rd.on a two arched bridge near  
the Station Hotel.It then crossed the  
River Usk by a 7 span iron bridge.The  
foundations can still be seen.Much of  
the route can still be traced.The      
embankment on either side of the Brecon
Rd. can be seen very overgrown.A new   
road is being built on the route.The   
land was cleared and filled with stones
and soil.New factories will be built   
beside the road.The station site is now
used by the Electricity Board.Part of  
the railway lodging house is now a     
social club and the rest is the house  
of Lucy Tatum who attends Harold Rd.   
School.The goods shed is now a D.I.Y.  
warehouse and the engine shed is a     
council depot.
