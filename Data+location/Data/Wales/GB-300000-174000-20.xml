		<content>   The Great house in Aberthin was     
 built by William Thomas. Most of the  
 house dates from early 17th.century.  
 Since then,very little of this        
 beautiful house has been altered.     
 There is a large garden and a         
 gatehouse which is approached by a    
 bridge over a small stream in         
 Aberthin.The main characteristic is   
 the symmetrical front elevation of the
 house.                                
   During the early 14th.century a     
 battle is said to have taken place    
 on Stalling Down. Owain Glyndwr       
 claimed to be descended from the      
 rulers of Powys. He gathered Welsh    
 forces and carried out a guerilla type
 war against the authority of King     
 Henry IV. The Battle of Llanquian     
 took place on Stalling Down.          
 Unfortunately no evidence of this     
 battle exists.                        </content>
