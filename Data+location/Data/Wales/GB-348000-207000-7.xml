		<title>07TRELLECH QUARRY,LYDART</title>
		<content> This small quarry,on the northern     
 side of Trellech Hill,has been        
 operated by a succession of licensees,
 but their profitability has been      
 subject to the vagaries of the local  
 economic climate.                     
 This site is noteworthy for the       
 acid quartzite aggregate that is the  
 product of eroded puddingstone or     
 quartz conglomerate. The loose rock is
 extracted,washed and graded as sand,  
 pea gravel and gravel.                
 The lack of alkaline chemicals means  
 that the aggregate can be used as a   
 bedding for underground pipes or for  
 construction,where alkaline corrosion 
 would be unacceptable.                
 The pea gravel is used in large       
 quantities by nurseries to make up an 
 acidic potting compost for those plant
 groups such as rhododendrons and      
 heathers which demand lime free soils.</content>
