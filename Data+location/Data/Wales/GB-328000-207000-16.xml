		<content> This school was erected by the late   
 Lord Treowen as a memorial to his son 
 and heir Captain Elidyr Herbert killed
 on active service in Palastine in Nov 
 1917.The school forms part of the     
 model village of Tre Elidyr Llanover  
 the whole of which is a memorial to   
 the solders of world war1.There are18 
 houses built from local stone and     
 timber .20 were planned but 2 were    
 unfinished when Lord Treowen died. The
 houses surround a village green which 
 are now the playing fields.The war    
 memorial is of undressed stones from  
 the local quarry.On top of the stones 
 is a gilded cross.Behind the cross is 
 a recess in which are 3 brass plaques 
 bearing   an inscription and the names
 of the fallen. An arc of lime trees   
 was planted one for each of the fallen
 an avenue of lime trees leads through 
 the green to the memorial.            </content>
