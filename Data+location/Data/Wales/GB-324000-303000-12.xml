		<content>   This week we celebrated the 500th   
 anniversary of Henry Tudor's march to 
 Bosworth. We all dressed up in Middle 
 Ages costumes, as knights and archers,
 lords or peasants. We joined other    
 schools, and walked around the Celtic 
 Fort of Beacon Ring on Long Mountain  
 where Henry camped with his followers.
    We went on to another school where 
 we had a typical picnic lunch of those
 days. It was great fun. Then we put on
 entertainment for each other. Our     
 school performed a Miracle Play.      
 Others did jousting, dancing and so   
 on. Then we finished this exciting day
 by going round the stalls of a Middle 
 Age Fair. There were stocks too. We   
 had free sweets at a comfit stall, and
 there were free pony rides. We wish   
 all history lessons were as exciting!
