		<content> The grid contains a village Primary   
 School at Rhewl.This was established  
 in 1918 under Denbighshire C.C.       
 On roll upon opening were 19 pupils.  
 Upon the building of the Council      
 Estates at Rhewl &amp; Llanynys in the    
 1950's the school population grew to  
 an all-time high of 93 in 1973 but has
 steadily shrunk tothe 43 of today.    
 Following the 1870 Education Act the  
 Church originally provided elementary 
 education in a building adjacent to   
 the present school,now a private      
 house. The school is essentially      
 bilingual with a teaching staff of    
 2,one being the Head.                 
 A Residential School for problematical
 children from Merseyside also lies    
 within the grid.Sunday School, once   
 flourishing, is weakly attended today.
