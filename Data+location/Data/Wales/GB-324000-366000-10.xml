		<title>10LIFE-STYLES LOCAL PUB</title>
		<content> Mr Coppack,the manager,stocks up once 
 a week and takes over Â£200 each       
 day.His local bitter is brewed in     
 Warrington and is the most popular    
 drink sold in the pub.Nine different  
 types of Whisky are sold, the most    
 popular of which is Bell's.Nine       
 different types of bottled beer are   
 available and also a very strong cider
 called "Scrumpy Jack".                
 The opening hours each day are from 11
 a.m. to 3 p.m. and again from         
 5.30.p.m. to 10.30 p.m. - with an     
 extra half hour on Fridays.Meals are  
 available to customers for consumption
 with their drinks.This is a very      
 popular public house, especially in   
 the summer, when tourists necessitate 
 an increase in the number of part time
 staff to six.At the present time it is
 a thriving  concern according to the  
 manager.                              </content>
