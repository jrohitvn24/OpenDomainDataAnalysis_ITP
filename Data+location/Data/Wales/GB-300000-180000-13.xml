 Originally the economy of the village 
 was divided between agriculture and   
 mining (iron ore and coal).Now there  
 is no mining and much of the farmland 
 has been taken over for building and  
 by the M4 moterway.There are no       
 factories and very little employment  
 except for services.Most of the people
 now commute to the industrial estates 
 at Bridgend,Treforest and Talbot Green
 or even as far afield as Cardiff.Some 
 men are still miners but the number   
 has dwindled to a very small number.  
 Two big local employers are the Open  
 Cast Coal Site at Llanharan and the   
 Brewery at Pontyclun.Both Ysgol Gyfun 
 Llanhari and Llanhari Primary School  
 offer part time employment for women  
 kitchen staff and cleaners.
