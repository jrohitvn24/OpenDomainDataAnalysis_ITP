		<content> Principal features.Risca is situated  
 on the southern edge of the south     
 wales coalfield where the ebbw valley 
 opens out onto the coastal plain.This 
 valley is known as the"Western valley"
 because it is the most westerly valley
 in Gwent.Overlooking the town on      
 either side are two large hills called
 Mynydd Machen and Mynydd Henllys.On   
 top of Mynydd Henllys at 419m is an   
 ancient fortress called the"Tump".The 
 town takes up the valley floor but as 
 you move up the hillsides the houses  
 give way to hill farms and            
 forests.Risca has a small reservoir   
 called pant-yr-eos which means hollow 
 of the nigntingale.An old disused     
 canal called the Monmouthshire and    
 Brecon canal runs through the town.It 
 also has a goods railway and a new    
 road to by-pass the town is under     
 construction.                         </content>
