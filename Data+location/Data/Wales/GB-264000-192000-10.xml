 The most important feature of our     
 study block is{the renewal of Swansea 
{City centre and foreshore. Two        
 important happenings created the      
 situation where a lot of new buildings
 were needed. These events were the    
{decline of the old industries}and the 
 damage done by{the blitz in 1941      
 during the war. Although these events 
 happened a long time ago, it is only  
 now that we can see the results of    
 urban renewal. Some of the            
 developments include the Quadrant     
 centre, St. Davids centre, the leisure
 centre and the Marina.                
 These modern buildings help to give   
 this area of Swansea a cleaner and    
 more spacious appearance although{many
{older people think that Swansea has   
{lost its character.                   </content>
