		<title>06     Clubs in Buckley</title>
		<content> Buckley has a wide range of things for
 people to do.there is a sports centre 
 which offers all kinds of sport. I go 
 to Buckley Gym Club in the large      
 gymnasium on Tuesdays and Fridays. In 
 Buckley alone there are 3 cub-scouts  
 packs and brownies. We have two mens  
 football teams,Buckley Wanderers and  
 Hawksbury Villa. I used to watch      
 Hawkesbury Villa play. In Buckley     
 about 10 years ago there were 3 teams.
 The third was Buckley Rovers.         
  For teenagers n Buckley there is the 
 Under 18 Pool Club. Lots of men in    
 Buckley go fishing in the Trap. They  
 often have matches. There is a dancing
 class for girls at the Tabernacle     
 Sunday school.                        
  The cricket club at Lane End plays   
 every week. Every summer is a         
 playscheme involving games and visits 
 to pools and icerinks regulary.       </content>
