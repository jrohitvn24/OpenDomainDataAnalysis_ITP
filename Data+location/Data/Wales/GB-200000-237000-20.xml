		<content> The information - both written        
 contributions and photographs -about  
 Dinas village and its immediate area  
 was collated and recorded by pupils   
 and teachers of Ysgol Dinas (Dinas    
 C.P.School).                          
 The headmaster, who was in charge of  
 the whole project in the school, was  
 Terwyn Tomos.He was supported by      
 Mrs.Clare Thomas, whose class         
 conducted several surveys and wrote a 
 number of the pages recorded here.    
   The whole Domesday Project at Dinas 
 School was part of a larger theme of  
 environmental studies and studying the
 community. Most of the 51 children at 
 the school could not contribute       
 directly to the recorded work, but    
 each and every pupil was involved in  
 the preparatory work.
