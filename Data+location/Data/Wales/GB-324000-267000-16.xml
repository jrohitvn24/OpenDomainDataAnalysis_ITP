		<content> It is vital for everyone in this area 
 to have their own motor transport -   
 many people live in isolated valleys  
 which have never had public transport 
 apart from school buses. Public bus   
 services have almost ceased - one     
 regular bus runs through Whitton on   
 one day per week only and this runs   
 only to Knighton (4miles). Visits to  
 towns further afield are by specially 
 arranged hire coaches only or cars    
 have to be used to gain access to     
 route terminals in towns. The Central 
 Wales Railway line runs through       
 Knighton (Swansea to Shrewsbury) with 
 conncections to all major towns which 
 is very good in this day and age but, 
 again, the problem is getting to the  
 station without your own transport,   
 and the fact that trains are          
 relatively few. An active supporters  
 club seeks to keep the railway open.  </content>
