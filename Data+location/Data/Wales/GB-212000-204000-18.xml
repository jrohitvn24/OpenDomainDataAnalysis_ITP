		<content> At 10.30am we went swimming.The other 
 classes had play.I didn't speak all   
 the way there on the bus.We all swam  
 as many widths as we could in 15      
 minutes and then we did some lengths. 
 Back to school then I walked back home
 for lunch.I had lunch and carried my  
 baritone horn back in the afternoon. I
 had my lesson and played soft ball and
 then I went to work doing Maths,      
 English + French.After school I found 
 more presents to open at home,watched 
 Gentle Ben on TV.Then went to get     
 ready to go to Brass Band practace-I  
 realised I'd left my instrument in    
 school so my mother sent me to bed.
