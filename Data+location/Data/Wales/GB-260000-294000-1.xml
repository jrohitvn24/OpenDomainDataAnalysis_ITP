		<title>01ABERDYFI AND DYFI ESTUARY</title>
		<content>     Located at the southern edge of   
 the Snowdonia National Park the Dyfi  
 Estuary is the historical meeting     
 place of North and South Wales.       
    The northern shore rises steeply   
 from the estuary waters into a        
 succession of hills culminating at the
 summit of Cader Idris.A network of    
 mountain tracks and paths make the    
 area particularly rewarding for the   
 energetic walker.                     
    The whole estuary up to the high   
 water mark forms part of the Dyfi     
 National Nature Reserve.An information
 centre at Ynylas is situated at the   
 mouth of the estuary on the southern  
 shore.                                
    The attractive holiday resort of   
 Aberdyfi is located where the rocky   
 northern side of the estuary gives way
 to a sandy beach backed by dunes which
 stretch almost four miles to Tywyn.   </content>
