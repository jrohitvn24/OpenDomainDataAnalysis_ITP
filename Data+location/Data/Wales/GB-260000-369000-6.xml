		<title>06Tairmeibion Farm</title>
		<content>     Tairmeibion Farm is a modern and  
 efficient farm business.Expansion is  
 often necessary and this can be seen  
 at Tairmeibion in the building of a   
 new cattle parlour.However,in recent  
 years conservation and the aesthetic  
 (scenic) quality of the land has      
 become of greater importance to       
 people,thus greater emphasis has been 
 put on the landscaping of farms to    
 improve their scenic quality.         
              Tairmeibion with its     
 two large silos and its slurry tank   
 lies in a very flat area,whereby,such 
 structures stand out against the      
 skyline.The owner of the Cochwillan   
 Estate intends to plant a shelter belt
 of trees around the slurry tank and   
 new cattle parlour in the near        
 future.Thus in years to come it will  
 improve the visual character of the   
 farm.                                 </content>
