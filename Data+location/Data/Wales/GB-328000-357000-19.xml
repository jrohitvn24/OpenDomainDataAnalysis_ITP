		<title>19A TYPICAL DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> At 7.30 I get up and have a wash using
 freezing cold water (to wake me up).  
 I read the paper until 7.50 then I    
 shout my brothers.  I have Cornflakes 
 and tea for breakfast.  At 8.30 I walk
 slowly to school.  At 8.50 we go into 
 tutor group with our form tutor.  Our 
 first lessons are usually French or   
 Welsh then we have a break before     
 going into science.  We have a 50     
 minute lunch break before music and   
 R.E., then we have history.  After    
 tea a lot of children go to the       
 playing fields to play rounders.      
 Rounders is a game where there are    
 four posts in a square and a person   
 throws the ball at you and you try to 
 hit it.  Everytime you get round all  
 the posts before the ball is back with
 the bowler you score a rounder.
