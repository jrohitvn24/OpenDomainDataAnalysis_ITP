		<content> The 4 x 3 Km block is situated on an  
 upland plateau approximately 600 feet 
 above sea level. It lies to the East  
 of the Clwydian Hills which have      
 recently been designated an area of   
 outstanding natural beauty. The       
 district is completely unspoilt and   
 there has been very little change or  
 development in the area for the past  
 century or more. It consists mainly of
 scattered farms and houses and some   
 small blocks of woodland. The farms   
 are served by a network of minor roads
 and the busy A55 trunk road runs East 
 West along the Southern quarter of the
 block There is a splendid variety of  
 flora and fauna along the lane verges,
 some of which are extinct in other    
 parts of Great Britain. Hawks, Owls   
 and Kestrels are present along with a 
 wide range of other birds.
