		<content> Work on improving the A55 continues.In
 June 1985 a dual carriageway          
 bi-passing Colwyn Bay was opened as   
 far as Glan Conwy corner.At the moment
 a new link road is being constructed  
 from the latter to Llandudno via      
 Bodysgallen and Llanrhos.The next     
 stage of the scheme is scheduled to   
 start soon from Conwy Morfa towards   
 Llanfairfechan.The final stage is     
 crossing the River Conwy.The present  
 plan is to sink a "tunnel tube" in the
 bed of the river.We have witnessed    
 drilling rigs  on the river during the
 year.Traffic queues at Conwy frustrate
 the locals and tourists in summer,yet 
 incomprehensibly bi-passing the town  
 is the last stage.Until the tunnel is 
 completed the queues will remain and  
 lengthen as the improved roads on     
 either side of the bottleneck add to  
 the traffic load.                     </content>
