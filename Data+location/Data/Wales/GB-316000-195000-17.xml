		<title>17Local employment.</title>
		<content>      The local employment has dropped 
 in our area because coal mines have   
 closed down. The people who moved here
 to work in the coal mines had to look 
 for other jobs when the coal mines    
 shut down. Alot of people now have    
 jobs outside our area but they still  
 live locally. many children in our    
 class have mothers and fathers who    
 work outside our area like Newport,   
 Cardiff, Tredegar, Trelewis etc. Our  
 biggest factories are Penny and Giles,
 Henlly Forklift and Switchgear only   
 employ some local people. We have some
 small industrial estates with small   
 factories.
