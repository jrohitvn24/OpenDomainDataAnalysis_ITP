		<title>08The Sinclair C5 electric car</title>
		<content> It was driven by a battery and could  
 go 20 miles before the battery needed 
 charging.It had a  coloured dial which
 showed you how much electricity was   
 left in the battery.It also had pedals
 so you could still move if the battery
 was flat.                             
 I had my photograph taken sitting in  
 the car.Then it was my turn to drive  
 it.I was really excited and a little  
 nervous.I was told how to start and   
 stop it.Then off I went ,it felt a bit
 strange the first time around the hall
 and I went slowly.But the second and  
 third time was great.                 
 My father was disappointed with it and
 thought it would never sell.He said it
 was not safe for the roads.           
 But I thought it was great and asked  
 my dad could I have one for my        
 birthday.He said no fear! not at Â£399.
 I think I'll ask my mother.           </content>
