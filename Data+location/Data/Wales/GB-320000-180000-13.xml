		<title>13PLACE NAMES</title>
		<content> Usually the place names of an area are
 decided by the City Council,following 
 a theme.                              
{ Llanrumney}for example has one area  
 named after writers,eg: Shaw Close,   
 Hazlitt Place.Another area is named   
 after West Country towns,eg:Burnham   
 Avenue,Lynmouth Crescent.             
{ TROWBRIDGE}has many roads named after
 Welsh towns,eg:Aberdaron Rd.          
   The areas of{LLANEDEYRN }and{PENTWYN
  were designated in consultation with 
 the developers.They were in the main  
 named after some local feature before 
 development began,hence the names     
 related to woods,plant or land form.  
  Some were named plainly in English,{ 
{(Roundwood, Chapelwood}). Others were 
 given a Welsh translation,({WAUN FACH-
  little meadow,{BRYN Y NANT}hill on   
 the stream).There are a few that have 
 no translation,eg:{COED Y GORES}      </content>
