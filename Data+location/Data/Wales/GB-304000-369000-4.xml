		<content> Interview with Mr.George Williams.    
 He has lived in Trefnant all his life,
 when he was a boy, there used to be   
 one big food shop, a grocer shop, a   
 paper shop, a post office, a public   
 house, a shoe shop and a butchers     
 shop. He says the village has trebled 
 in size from when he was small. He is 
 a farmer and deals in livestock, sheep
 ,pigs and cows. He is an agent for    
 butchers all over the country,        
 Manchester, Wolverhampton and Glasgow.
 He used to run a butchers shop his    
 father had left him but he gave that  
 up to do farming. The butchers had    
 been in the family since 1900.        
 The village is happy and very         
 close-nit, there are a lot of old     
 English people who have come to retire
 in the area and the villages have no  
 objections. Trefnant has won the      
 competition for the best kept village </content>
