   Cardiff was  used for bigger items  
 because it offers a wider selection of
 goods at cheaper prices.Cardiff was   
 also the centre for cinemas and       
 nightclubs but all the vale pubs were 
 well attended.                        
   Most houses had children , the      
 average being 2. Like the adults they 
 liked the area but complained that    
 they had to travel too far for        
 entertainment and wished there were   
 more local amenities.There is a bus   
 into Cowbridge 3 times a week. Adults 
 would like the village to have        
 gas,mains drainage,a village hall, a  
 shop and a pub.                       
   Everyone wished sports facilities   
 were better.There are several         
 important community organisations,a   
 Residents Association, Parish Council 
 and a village Social Committee.       </content>
