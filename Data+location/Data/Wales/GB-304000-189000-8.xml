		<content> A group of children went to Dewi Sant 
 hospital. There has been a hospital   
 there since 1865.At first it was known
 as the Union Workhouse where poor     
 people could go to work and get food. 
 It was hard and unpleasant in the     
 workhouse and not many people went    
 there.In 1967 a hospital was built and
 opened in 1968 so that they could     
 install the equipment.This is a       
 geriatric hospital and it looks after 
 people over 70. In the new hospital   
 there are 128 beds,4 wards and 300    
 staff who do different jobs including 
 physiotherapists, occupational        
 therapists,radiographers,E.C.G.       
 technicians,engineers,plumbers,cooks, 
 doctors,nurses,gardeners and telephone
 operators.
