		<title>03DULAIS VALLEY</title>
		<content> The Dulais valley is situated at the  
 southern edge of the Brecon Beacons   
 National park.Some 6miles away at     
 Blaen-nant colliery is the Cefn-coed  
 coal and steam museum which is open to
 the public all the year round.About 9 
 miles away the Aberdulais Falls and   
 canal complex and the Penscynor wild  
 life park are also to be found.Along  
 the summit of Hirfynydd runs the      
 remains of the roman road from Neath  
 to Brecon called Sarn Helen.Industrial
 remains and coal refuse tips used to  
 be very much in evidence but land     
 reclamation and landscaping have got  
 rid of many of these former eyesores. 
 The Forestry Commission have also     
 established picnic and viewing        
 areas and walks for people to be able 
 to explore and enjoy the area natural 
 beauty.This may prove to be a great   
 help to the area in the future.       </content>
