		<content> Our area of Llanelli developed around 
 the steel and tinplate industries but 
 due to the recession,employment trends
 have changed, with unemployment       
 becoming an increasingly significant  
 factor.Many industries have closed    
 down completely-including the Duport  
 steelworks.1985 has also seen the     
 demise of the Machynys Works and the  
 Llanelli Skill Centre.                
   However, a survey of class J4 in    
 Halway School revealed that 100% of   
 our fathers have full time work.In an 
 area where there is 18% unemployment  
 we consider ourselves fortunate       
{INDUSTRY(Steelworks and mining)...28% 
{SERVICES..........................50% 
{OFFICES...........................22% 
   88% of our mothers have jobs but    
 half of them only work part-time.Most 
 of them work in the service sector as 
 shop assistants, cleaners etc.        </content>
