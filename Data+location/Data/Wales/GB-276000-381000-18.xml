		<title>18Llandudno Lifeboat (contd)</title>
		<content>  It is 11.28m long, 3.51m wide and    
 weighs 10.668 tonnes. Maximum speed   
 8.5 knots (11 mph). If it overturns, a
 powerful pump rights the boat in 6    
 secs.  A large, powerful, caterpillar 
 tractor, fitted with hardwood blocks  
 to prevent damage to road surfaces,   
 pulls the boat to the launching site -
 we can feel the vibration when it goes
 past. The crew of 7 are called to the 
 station by flare (day) and by phone or
 bleepers (night). All are volunteers  
 and 5 live in town.  There were 32    
 rescues in the year 1984-5, 10 by the 
 Lilly Wainwright(which can carry 65   
 persons) and 22 by the inshore craft. 
 Quickest time from station to launch -
 8 mins (high tide),16 mins (low tide).
 The lifeboat is so important to Llan- 
 dudno because some of the large number
 of tourists do no heed warning signs  
 and good advice when in the water.    </content>
