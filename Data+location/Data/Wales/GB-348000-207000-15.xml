		<title>15PENALLT W. I. (nr. LYDART)</title>
		<content> The Penallt branch of the Womens      
 Institute was formed in 1963,and at   
 present has 39 members,ranging in age 
 from 20 to over 80.                   
 We have as wide a range of interests  
 as we have members; we arrange theatre
 visits,trips to stately homes,cookery 
 demonstrations,and concern ourselves  
 particularly with Third World affairs.
 This year,1985,we have raised nearly  
 Â£200 for the African famine appeal,   
 and have helped to provide water      
 supplies for women in the Maldives.   
 We meet once a month in Pelham Hall,  
 and attract members from Penallt,     
 Lydart and Trellech. Our meetings     
 start with a short business session   
 followed by an outside speaker and end
 with tea and gossip!                  
 We send a representative to as many   
 outside W.I. functions as possible,and
 also to the W.I.'s Denman College.    </content>
