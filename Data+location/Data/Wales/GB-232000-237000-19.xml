		<title>19BARGOD RANGERS FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> The Bargod Rangers Football club was  
 formed in 1897, and when the Cardigan-
 shire Football League was formed in   
 1921, the club was one of the initial 
 members. Although the club has        
 achieved a number of successes, none  
 can be as notable as the Triple Trophy
 victories in 1957/58. The task of     
 winning the League Championship,the   
 Cardigan Bay Cup, the Cardiganshire   
 League Cup was accomplished for the   
 first time by a Club since the        
 League's inauguration.The same feat   
 was repeated in 1962/63.In 1975 we saw
 the Official Opening of the new       
 Changing Rooms at Parc Puw, Drefach.  
 Then in 1978, we saw the official     
 opening of the new ground surface/    
 drainage scheme which was installed at
 a cost of Â£20,000.In 1937/38 an ex    
 club member, Oswald Davies gained a   
 Welsh Amateur Cap.  {MR.MICHAEL DAVIES</content>
