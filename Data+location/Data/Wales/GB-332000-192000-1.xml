		<title>01Llanfrechfa and Ponthir</title>
		<content>   The meaning of Llanfrechfa is       
 uncertain. Llan means an enclosure    
 usually reserved for the purposes of  
 religion. The village of Ponthir lies 
 between Cwmbran and Newport, and in   
 1677 was in the boundary of Usk. The  
 language was Welsh, but today very few
 people speak welsh in our village. In 
 1605 the name of our village was      
 Pontheere, at a leter peiod the final 
 'e' was taken off. Sometime later it  
 was called Ponthir. When the raileay  
 station was built in 1978 it gave its 
 proper spelling of Ponthir, Ponthir   
 meaning low bridge. It eventually took
 its name from the bridge over the     
 river, the other name that its known  
 as is Lower Llanfrechfa. The first    
 bridge built over the Avon was made of
 wood and was frequently damaged by    
 floods. The present bridge was made of
 stone and was built in 1800.          </content>
