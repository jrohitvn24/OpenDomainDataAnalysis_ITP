		<content> The world famous Kerry Sheep are still
 verymuch in evidence and provide the  
 main income, with cattle for the local
 farmers. The forestry plantations have
 been allowed to run down with         
 subsequent loss of livelihood for     
 local people. The nearby Anchor Inn   
 provides a cente for local people to  
 meet and also attracts clientele      
 from Newtown (8ms to n/w) as well as  
 passing tourists.  Topography ranges  
 in height from approx 820 to 1500 with
 rainfall of about 55 inches a year.   
 Public transport amounts to one coach 
 a week, on a tuesday, to Newtown for  
 market day.  About 25% of the fields  
 have been drained and reseeded thanks 
 to govenrment grants which have also  
 helped with fencing,forests type farm 
 roads and of course the subsidies for 
 cattle and sheep has made the land a  
 viable proposition to earn a living.  </content>
