 LOWEST LAND 80 METRES ABOVE SEA LEVEL.
 THE VIEW IS RESTRICTED BY GENTLE HILLS
 BUT SKIRRID FAWR CAN BE SEEN TO THE   
 NORTH, SKIRRID FACH TO THE WEST. THE  
 AREA IS MAINLY AGRICULTURAL, TWO WOODS

 (MIXED) ARE IN THE AREA. THE FIELDS   
 ARE SMALL BOUNDED BY MIXED HEDGEROWS  
 (HAWTHORNE, BRAMBLES, HAZEL, HOLLY).  
 THREE BROOKS FLOW THROUGH THE AREA    
 SUPPLIED BY NUMEROUS SPRINGS. WINDING 
 CART TRACKS WORN BY WEATHERING ARE NOW
 METALLED AND FORM SINGLE TRACK LANES  
 BOUNDED BY HIGH HEDGES. TWO ELECTRIC  
 PYLON SYSTEMS ZIGZAG ROUND THE HILLS. 
 THERE ARE FARM HOUSES WITH BARNS AND  
 OUTBUILDINGS. THERE ARE SCATTERED     
 COTTAGES CLOSE TO THE LANES.
