    The original Rhiwbebyll Isaf farm  
 dates back, circa 1450, and Lodge farm
 near Fford Las dates back to Tudor    
 times.                                
   PUBS.                               
    The White horse inn at Hendrerwydd 
 is over 400 years old, is very quaint 
 and well preserved, and was originally
 both pub and village store combined.  
   CHURCH.                             
    St. Cynhafal's church is a very old
 building, going back to the 15th      
 century and until 1834 music for the  
 services was supplied by a bass, viola
 and two clarinettes. At the side of   
 the church is a very beautiful half   
 timbered house built in the 17th      
 century by the Jones family.
