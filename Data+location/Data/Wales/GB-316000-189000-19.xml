		<content>      In the 1870's Cwmfelinfach was   
 still just a few farmhouses,sheep     
 farms and workers' cottages.There was 
 also a mill-Cwmfelinfach means "valley
 of the little mill." The main         
 routeways followed the mountain       
 summits.A tram road from Tredegar ran 
 through the area built by the Sirhowy 
 Co. On 26th.Dec.1829 the first steam  
 train passed through the village.In   
 1850 the tramroad was converted to a  
 railway by the Monmouthshire and      
 Brecon Rail Co.From 1904-5 the        
 colliery shaft was sunk and the       
 village gradually grew as we know it. 
 By 1921 all the streets we know now   
 were built.The Pioneer Hotel,a local  
 meeting place,was built in 1907,the   
 school 1909,the Institute 1913.The    
 oldest residence is the White House   
 recently restored and on the Blackwood
 Chartists route to Newport.           </content>
