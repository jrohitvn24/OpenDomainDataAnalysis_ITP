		<title>03Day Centre</title>
		<content> The Day Centre was purposely built for
 the care of elderly and handicapped   
 people.It serves a very wide area.A   
 special bus is used to convey them to 
 and from the centre.The centre is open
 five days a week from 8:00am. until   
 5:00pm.The patients arrive at 9:00am. 
 and depart at 3:30pm. Most of the     
 people that use the centre live alone 
 and they enjoy coming  there for      
 company.Trained staff are employed at 
 the centre to look after the patients.
 Meals are cooked in modern kitchens at
 the centre and the menu is varied.A   
 hair dresser is in attendance daily   
 and the elderly are able to have their
 hair washed and set. The  majority of 
 the patients undertake some therapy   
 either painting, woodwork or basket   
 work. There is also a library in the  
 building,but a large number of the    
 patients use this room to rest.       </content>
