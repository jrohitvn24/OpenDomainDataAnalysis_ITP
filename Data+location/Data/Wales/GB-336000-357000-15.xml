		<content> Darland School, Rossett, is fully     
 involved in local charity work.  Since
 opening in 1958, the school has       
 supported the Leprosy Mission.  The   
 school and community support the      
 Gladys Aylward Childrens' Trust and   
 Christian Aid.  Year long appeals have
 been run for the Tear Fund, Oxfam for 
 Ethiopia, R.N.I.B., Cystic Fibrosis   
 charity and Save the Children.        
                                       
 At Harvest Festival time first and    
 second year pupils bring produce which
 is distributed to the senior citizens 
 of the area.  Senior pupils bring     
 donations for charity.                
                                       
 At Christmas time a concert and tea   
 are given for the residents of        
 Trevalyn Hospital. A Carol Service is
