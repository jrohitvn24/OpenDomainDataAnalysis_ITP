		<title>10James' Sunday at home</title>
		<content>  {Sunday}for us is usually a quiet    
 family day. My sister and I get up at 
{9:30am}and after a small breakfast of 
{tea and toast}we play in one of the   
 bedrooms for a while before getting   
 changed. I read for a while or chat to
 Mum or Dad whilst Rachel writes or    
 draws. After a light lunch of{soup,   
{sandwiches and fruit}I hurry down to  
 my friend Peter's house where we play 
 tennis in the back garden. At{5:30pm}I
 go home for my main meal which usually
 consists of{meat, potatoes,vegetables 
{and gravy.}We then set off for the    
 Catholic Church - a modern building   
 near Bryn Stanley. After arriving home
 from Church I get my things ready for 
 school, check any homework is done    
 then prepare for bed where I          
 invariably read until I fall asleep.  
 Sunday is a happy family day for us as
 we have time to do things together.   </content>
