		<content> Our school survey of 256 pupils' homes
 showed that 45 families lived in      
 detatched houses, 127 in semidetatched
 76 in terraced and 8 in bungalows. Of 
 these 167 were privately owned and 89 
 council owned. We discovered that 60  
 mothers work fulltime, 95 part-time   
 and 101 do not work outside the home. 
 197 fathers work fulltime, 13         
 part-time and 45 are unemployed.      
 58 families go to a place of worship  
 regularly, 54 occasionally and 144    
 never.                                
 107 children own a computer and 52    
 parents use a computer in their work.
