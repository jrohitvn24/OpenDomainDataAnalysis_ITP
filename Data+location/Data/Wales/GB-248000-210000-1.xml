		<title>01The Area_Its Location</title>
		<content>  The area which includes the villages 
 of Pontyberem and Bancffosfelen, is   
 situated in the valley of the River   
 Gwendraeth Fawr.                      
  It lies within the parish of         
 Pontyberem, which was created in 1919.
 Previous to this, the area was        
 included, on the southern side of the 
 river,in the parish of Llannon and on 
 the northern side,in the parish of    
 Llangyndeyrn.                         
  Prior to the industrialisation of the
 valley in the mid_nineteenth          
 century,both villages were            
 agricultural in character with many   
 scattered homesteads.The area quickly 
 developed as its anthracite coal      
 measures were exploited.Owing to its  
 position on the ridge of the valley   
 slope,Bancffosfelen has kept much of  
 its rural character.The area is       
 between Llanelli and Carmarthen.B4306.</content>
