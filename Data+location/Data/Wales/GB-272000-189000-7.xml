		<content>   Port Talbot has 10 hotels two of    
 which are on the sea front. Near them 
 is the Afan Lido. It has an           
 Olympic-size swimming pool and a      
 sports centre with many activities.   
   We have 5 football pitches, 5       
 cricket pitches, 10 bowling greens, 30
 tennis courts, 2 putting greens and 38
 playgrounds.                          
   There is a three-mile stretch of    
 sand, but there is oil on parts of the
 beach and the sea is sometimes        
 polluted.                             
   There is a town centre in Station   
 Rd. It has many shops. To the west is 
 a railway station on the main London  
 line. There is a bus station to the   
 north-west.                           
   On the sea front there is a car park
 and a travelling fair visits us twice 
 during the year. We also have two     
 amusement arcades.                    </content>
