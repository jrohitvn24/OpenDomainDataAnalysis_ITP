		<content>      This is a Welsh Independent      
 Chapel which was established in 1754  
 within the grounds of the             
 Gellidochliethe Estate. The land was  
 leased to the chapel for 1,000 years  
 at a cost of 6d. per year.            
      Godre'rhos was visited on a      
 number of occasions by{Hywel Harris}  
 (1714-1773), a powerful preacher and  
 organiser of the Methodist Revival who
 travelled extensively on preaching    
 tours throughout Wales.               
      The Godre'rhos Sunday School was 
 reported in the 'notorious' 1847      
 'Inquiry on the State of Education in 
 Wales' as having been established in  
 1812. The report stated that there    
 were 9 male and 3 female teachers with
 a total of 87 scholars "on Books", out
 of which 74 " usually attend".
