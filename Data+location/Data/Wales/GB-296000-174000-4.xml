		<content> A day of Roman style fun took over    
 much of the Vale of Glamorgan. The    
 march was in aid of two worthy causes:
 caring for the needy children of      
 Barnardos and helping the Heritage    
 Coast Project to provide 'talking     
 posts' in Dunraven Garden for the     
 blind to enjoy. The Legionaries formed
 up on the old Roman Road in Cowbridge 
 to re-enact the style of the invaders 
 from nearly 2,000 years ago.          
  Led by the cavalry, the legion halted
 outside Cowbridge Town Hall - also on 
 a Roman Road - where they were met by 
 the senators. Tribune Gareth Williams,
 former Welsh Rugby International,     
 sought permission from Senator Alan   
 Rees, Mayor of Cowbridge, to form a   
 legion. The rostrum party were as well
 turned out in costume as the horses,  
 chariots, legionaries and slaves. The 
 march was over a 7 mile course.       </content>
