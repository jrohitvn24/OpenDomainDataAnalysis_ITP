		<content> Bwlch-y-groes school is half a mile   
 from the village of Bwlch-y-groes.The 
 school was built in 1876.There are 29 
 pupils in the school and two          
 teachers.The teachers are Mrs Bowen   
 and the Headteacher is Mr Phillips.Mrs
 Wise is the Caretaker and Mrs Salmon  
 is the school Cook.Mrs Stephens looks 
 after us at lunchtimes.Most of the    
 children speak Welsh.Only one child in
 our class can't speak Welsh,but two   
 others can understand it and speak a  
 little.Children start school when they
 are four years old and they leave at  
 eleven years old  to go to Preseli    
 Secondary school.Children stay in the 
 Infants class until they are seven and
 then they come to the Headteacher's   
 class.The school is like a big        
 family.I like coming to school very   
 much.
