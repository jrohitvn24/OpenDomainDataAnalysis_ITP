{_ Block 0324201}represents a coming   
 together of the{rural landscape and   
{the industrial urbanisation of  a     
{typical South Wales river valley.     
   The urbanisation has grown along    
 the river{Afon Lwyd,}mainly along the 
 West side, which represents the       
 extreme limits of the{South Wales     
{coalfield.                            
   It was an area of early idustrial-  
 isation which is now in decline:{land 
{usage is reverting back to its natural
{state.}As a result,traditional indust-
 ries have disappeared leaving behind  
 the results of a{TOO RAPID GROWTH     
 which have manifested themselves in   
{social and industrial depravation.    
   Industry has left its mark on the   
 area visably and socially in the form 
 of poor housing, limited facilities in
 schools and poor job prospects.       </content>
