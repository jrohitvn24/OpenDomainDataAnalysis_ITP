 much this year because my uncle Max   
 stuck his foot in the side of it and  
 broke it,so we bought another one.    
   Another sport of ours is{fishing}but
 I'm not too fussed on it.One day my   
 mother caught a dog fish,but was so   
 frightened of it my father had to put 
 it in to the sea.Another fish that was
 caught was a conga-eel,but as it was  
 trying to bite the dinghy my father   
 had to cut the line.                  
    A successful catch was caught by my
 sister.The fish that was caught was a 
 sea-trout which I called Henry. Henry 
 was eaten for tea.
