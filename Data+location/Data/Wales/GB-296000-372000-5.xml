 Clwyd County Council have given       
 Bodelwyddan Castle's Great Hall a     
 major face-lift in a bid to make it   
 the area's best cultural centre.  It  
 is hoped that the Great Hall will     
 provide a venue for all sorts of      
 groups to meet and to perform.  The   
 Great Hall has kept much of its old   
 school look because of its high       
 ceiling.  The accoustics there are    
 very good because of the height.      
 Adjoining the Hall, the old domestic  
 science block has been converted into 
 a coffee lounge and bar.              
 Another feature which it is hoped will
 attract music lovers is the 75 year   
 old concert piano which the council   
 acquired with the contents of the     
 college.  It is a Steinway piano      
 valued at more than Â£250,000 which has
 also been renovated.                  </content>
