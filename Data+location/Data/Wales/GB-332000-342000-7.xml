 Most people did their own baking of   
 bread until freezers came in about 12 
 years ago.Farmers had their own       
 animals killed for the freezer.Up to  
 about 5 years ago the farmers' wives  
 made food for all the farm workers.   
 At Christmas,years ago,most families  
 would invite all the local families to
 parties.                              
  Silent films were shown in Overton   
 Hall 50 years ago,with someone playing
 the piano.A visit to the theatre in   
 Chester was a great treat.Not many    
 people had a holiday then but there   
 were bus trips and an annual trip to  
 Rhyl.There used to be a dance in      
 Overton four times a year costing half
 a crown.There was also the Wrexham and
 Ellesmere Farmers Ball.Money raised   
 would go to the church or school      
 funds.                                </content>
