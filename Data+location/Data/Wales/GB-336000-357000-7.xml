		<content> Rossett has grown considerably in the 
 last 50 years.  There are many        
 different types of houses in the      
 village.                              
                                       
 Trevalyn Hall is the one large mansion
 in the area.  It was once owned by the
 Trevor family but is now split into 3 
 houses.                               
                                       
 In Station Road there are senior      
 citizens' bungalows and a row of      
 terraced Edwardian houses.  An estate 
 of council houses was built before the
 Second World War.                     
                                       
 In 1974 a new housing estate was      
 developed on what used to be common   
 land.  This estate has continued to   
 expand and now there are many detached
 and semi-detached houses as well as   
 bungalows.                            </content>
