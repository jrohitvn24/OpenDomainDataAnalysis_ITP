		<title>12MEDIA- THE PENCOED DIARY</title>
		<content>      The Diary is a small, local      
 newspaper containing news and         
 advertisements. Someway or another he 
 has to get information. He does this  
 by attending council meetings or by   
 people telephoning or writing letters 
 to him.                               
      The editor said that 6,000 copies
 a month are produced and that it takes
 between 2 and 5 days to publish the   
 Diary. The Diary has been in          
 circulation for 2 years and is        
 delivered free to each house. The     
 paper is free because they receive    
 about Â£500 from advertising.          
      The editor said it was important 
 that local events were included in the
 newspaper and he tried his best to see
 that his readers were kept well       
 informed.                             
      A school survey showed that      
 people enjoyed reading The Diary.     </content>
