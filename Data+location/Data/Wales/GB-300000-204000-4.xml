		<title>04Recreation in Heolgerrig.</title>
		<content>   Heolgerrig is a small village which 
 has very few leisure facilities.At the
 top of the village is a small peice of
 land where a climbing frame, two      
 swings and a bench are placed,but it  
 is only suitable for the younger      
 children.There are also two pubs and a
 Socail Club where adults go to drink, 
 play snooker,pool or darts.A weight   
 watchers club is held in Shirley      
 Gardens weekly.                       
   Every child who wants to go swimming
 ,play sport or dance etc has to travel
 from Heolgerrig to where the activity 
 is held.Rhydycar Leisure Centre is the
 main attraction.You can play virtually
 any indoor sport there.               
   Heolgerrig school is used for       
 activities also.There is a needle work
 class,various committee meetings,and  
 sometimes summer fetes are held in the
 school yard.                          </content>
