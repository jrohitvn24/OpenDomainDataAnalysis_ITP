 With the exception of the{BATTLE OF   
{MORFA RHUDDLAN}in 795 AD (which itself
 is not totally accepted as an         
 historical certainty) the area does   
 not have as rich a history as compared
 with its immediate surroundings.The   
 presence of an exapnse of marshland   
 the size of Morfa Rhuddlan detered the
{ROMANS}from building a road .The{     
{NORMANS,}who considered that Wales    
 began at the River Conwy and regarded 
 the remainder of North East wales to  
 be part of England,did not survey the 
 area in the original Domesday Book.The
 early {WELSH PRINCES}paid little heed 
 either to the area,which they called{ 
{RHUFONIOG.}RHUDDLAN CASTLE,built by   
 Edward 1 was not linked to the area   
 either by any major road.
