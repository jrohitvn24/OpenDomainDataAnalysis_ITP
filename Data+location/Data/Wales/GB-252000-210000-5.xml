		<content> From 8 a.m. my work is to maintain    
 Hydraulic Power Supports, there are   
 120 on the coal face where I work.    
 Each power support has six            
 hydraulically powered legs, each leg  
 supporting a maximum of 40 tonnes per 
 power support. These supports are used
 in all the coal faces in the Colliery.
 I have to ensure that the power pump  
 and hydraulic are working at maximum  
 pressure of 2500 p.s.i. at all times  
 so that the men working on the coal   
 face can produce coal in safety.      
                                       
 At 1.15 p.m. I ride the conveyor belt 
 back to the place for boarding        
 man-riding train which takes me back  
 to the bottom of the shaft. I ascend  
 to the top of the shaft, it is now    
 2.15 p.m. and I see blue sky once     
 more.                                 
                                       </content>
