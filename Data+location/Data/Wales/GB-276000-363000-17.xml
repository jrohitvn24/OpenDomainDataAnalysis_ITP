		<title>17Farming,Trefriw and Maenan.</title>
		<content> Farming in this area shows            
 considerable diversity as a result of 
 variations of soil and altitude.      
 The uplands above Trefriw provide     
 random summer grazing for sheep which 
 are brought down to lower levels for  
 the winter season, following ancient  
 practice. The valley fields are also  
 used for beef cattle and silage,      
 though some fields are  prone to      
 flooding, especially when heavy rain  
 fall over 24 hrs coincides with high  
 spring tides.An embankment has been   
 constructed in an attempt to control  
 flooding.                             
 The more fertile Maenan area has mixed
 farming, of sheep and cattle,together 
 with some potato and vegetable crops. 
 Some farmers augment their income     
 providing a service for caravanners.
