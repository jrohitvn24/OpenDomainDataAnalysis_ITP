		<title>03   ABERDULAIS WATERFALL.</title>
		<content>    In our area we have the{Aberdulais 
{Waterfall.}People long,long ago used  
 the water to turn a waterwheel to get 
 power to smelt Copper and Iron.       
  It was smelted in a building near the
 waterfall.You can see the ruins today,
 and{The National Trust}are trying to  
 restore things.They came in{1981}     
 and have about 5 people working there 
 at the moment.                        
               The falls have been used
 for Copper smelting,Corn-milling,Tin- 
 plate manufacture and also as a Iron  
 forge.They were first used in{1584}   
 when they used Charcoal and Coal from 
 the mountain.                         
             The falls were formed by a
 glacier cutting the ground away,which 
 made a valley so that the{River Dulais
 fell into the Neath valley.The falls  
 are ten and a half metres tall.
