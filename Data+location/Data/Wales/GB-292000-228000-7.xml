		<content> An important feature of Sennybridge   
 is the Army camp which provides       
 accommodation for troops which is     
 within easy reach of the training     
 area located on Mynydd Eppynt, the    
 extensive upland area to the north.   
 This is all kown as the SENNYBRIDGE   
 TRAINING AREA. It was created in the  
 early years of World War II and has   
 been in continuous use since that     
 time.  Since troops only come here for
 training and exercises, there is only 
 a small resident military staff at The
 Camp (as it is always known locally). 
 The majority of those working there   
 and maintaining services on the ranges
 are civilians.  Consequently this work
 is an important source of permanent   
 and temporary employment for the resid
 -ents of Sennybridge and Defynnog.
