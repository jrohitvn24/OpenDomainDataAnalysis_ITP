 The other nine houses were built in   
 the nineteenth century.All have been  
 kept in a good state of repair and all
 except three are now privately        
 owned.Two are used as summer          
 cottages.One house,which enjoys a     
 commanding position in the village,was
 built in the early nineteen eighties  
 on the site of an older property.     
   In the area there are nine large    
 farmhouses of indeterminate           
 age;although all are at least 150     
 years old.Seven are still occupied by 
 farmers but one is lived in by the    
 National Trust Warden and another is  
 now a private house.Some have cottages
 attached which were previously lived  
 in by farm workers.Nine of these      
 cottages were built in the last       
 century and two fairly recently.
