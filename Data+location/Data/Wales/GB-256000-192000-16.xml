		<title>16MR.B.PARKYN,THREE CROSSES</title>
		<content> Born in 1915 in a cottage overlooking 
 the village green at Three Crosses,   
 Brynwell Parkyn had ambitions to      
 become a journalist and before the    
 outbreak of war in 1939 worked for the
 South Wales Evening Post.War service  
 brought this to an end and he served  
 with the R.A.F. in the Far East.      
 Captured by the Japanese,he managed to
 escape and spent many months in the   
 jungle with guerilla groups.Returning 
 after the war in a state of poor      
 health,he eventually trained as a     
 hairdresser.Since the age of 5 he had 
 a keen interest in painting.Self      
 taught,painting in oils and water     
 colours,he specialises in views of    
 Gower.Whilst serving in Ceylon his    
 work came to the attention of Lord    
 Mountbatten who acquired four of his  
 water colours.In retirement he enjoys 
 walking and,of course, painting.      </content>
