		<content> WHEN I COME FROM SCHOOL I  MIGHT PLAY 
 A GAME OF MARBLES. WHAT YOU HAVE TO   
 DO IS ONE PERSON THROWS HIS MARBLE    
 AGAINST THE WALL,THEY ALL DO THE SAME 
 THEN WHEN YOU DO THAT THE FIRST PERSON
 TRIES TO HIT THE MARBLE,IF HE DOES ITS
 HIS. KEVIN AND I MIGHT PLAY A GAME OF 
 UP THE  LADDER, YOU HAVE  SIX  RED AND
 BLUE MEN EACH AND YOU THROW THE DICE  
 TILL YOU GET SIX AND WHO EVER GETS IT 
 STARTS AND IF THE PERSON GETS HALFWAY 
 UP THE LADDER HE WILL TIP OFF BACK_   
 WARDS THEN YOU HAVE TO START AGAIN.   
 MOST CHILDREN PLAY UP THE FORESTRY,   
 SUCH GAMES AS ARMY, HIDE AND SEEK OR  
 TAG FOOTBALL IS FAVOURITE ALSO,WITH   
 ALL THE YOUTH OF THE VILLAGE INVOLVED.
 SCHOOL PLAYTIMES USUALLY INVOLVE A    
 GAME OF BULLDOGS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A  
 RACE AND THE LAST ONE IS ON IT THEN   
 THE PERSON WHO IS ON IT SAYS BULLDOGS 
 AND WE RUN PAST THE CATCHERS.         </content>
