		<content> On Saturdays and Sundays I have an    
 extra half hour in bed. When I get    
 up on Saturday, I often walk down     
 the High Street to get some shopping  
 for my mum.At this time of the year,  
 we are beginning to think about       
 Christmas shopping.                   
 On Saturday afternoons, I sometimes go
 to watch Builth playing football with 
 my dad and in the evening, I go to a  
 Wyeside dico if there is one.On Sunday
 mornings I go to church and afterwards
 visit my nan, sometimes staying for   
 dinner. After dinner,I go home and    
 then call for friends. If it is a     
 pleasant day,we go down to the Groe on
 our bikes and play on the slide and   
 swings. If the weather should be bad, 
 I mostly stay in and play with my     
 brother or do some knitting and       
 sewing.On a very fine day, we might   
 all go for a ride in the car.         </content>
