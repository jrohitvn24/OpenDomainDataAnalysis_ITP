		<content> My name is Cerys, I go to Primary     
 School. On a school day, I dress in my
 uniform. Daddy drives me to school and
 I give in my homework and chat with my
 friends until the bell goes for       
 assembly. Then we have Maths until    
 break, followed by English, topic     
 work,Music, Drama,Art,Crafts and then 
 Games in Cwmdonkin Park. Ours is an   
 Independent School but most of my     
 friends go to State Schools. When I am
 11, I might go to a Comprehensive     
 School where there could be nearly    
 2000 children instead of 200. One     
 Comprehensive was the first Community 
 School in West Glamorgan, which is    
 open for various activities out of    
 school hours. When I am 18, I hope to 
 go to Swansea University to study     
 Oceanography.
