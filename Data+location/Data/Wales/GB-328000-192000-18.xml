		<title>18  Gymnastics in Cwmbran</title>
		<content>  Cwnbran has a very enthusiastic      
 gymnastics following. There are three 
 main gym clubs, South Gwent, Cwmbran  
 and Llantarnam, all of which have a   
 large number of children as members.  
 Each of the clubs are fortunate to    
 have excellent facilities and many of 
 the children are entered for various  
 competitions,as individuals and as    
 team members.

  On a Monday at 6.00pm I go to the    
 Stadium to train for gymnastics. We   
 warm up for half an hour then we move 
 onto the apparatus. We go on the floor
 first then we move on to the bars etc.
 At 8.00pm we pack up, some of us go   
 into the cafeteria for a drink or for 
 something to eat. When it is time to  
 go home we think"That was two hours   
 well spent".                          </content>
