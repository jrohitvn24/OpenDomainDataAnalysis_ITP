		<content>     {Transport}in our area            
  We live the{motorway}which was built 
 to take traffic away from busy        
{Morriston Cross}and to help Wales     
 develop her Industries.               
  In 1985 we have many means of        
 transport.We have                     
 cars,motorbikes,lorries,aeroplanes,shi
 ps and many other things.             
  I have only been in a bus,train,     
 car,aeroplane,ship and on a fast      
 motorbike.I used to hate{motorbikes   
 but now I love them.My dad doesn't    
 have one but my next door neighbour   
 does.I've been on it quite a few      
 times.It roars like a dragon and the  
 wind blows your hair out like a flag. 
      Lots of people don't have their  
 own transport and use buses.Buses may 
 change in the future and there may be 
 new kinds of transport invented.
