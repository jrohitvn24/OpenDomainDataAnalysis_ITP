 of goods including cotton,needles,toys
 food,fresh bread and milk.Bread costs 
 50p for a large loaf. They sell a     
 crate of milk(20 pints) per day at 23p
 per pint.Longlife milk is 27p a pint. 
  Butter varies from 52p per \ pound to
 62p. As the government subsidy has now
 stopped the prices will be increasing.
  Old potatoes cost 7_8p per pound. New
 potatoes range from 20p (Spanish) to  
 40p per pound (local). The local      
 potatoes are so dear as they tend to  
 be sold to the cities which pay higher
 prices, being the first new potatoes  
 in Britain.                           
  Shop hours are 9_1,&amp; 2.30_5.30, Mon
