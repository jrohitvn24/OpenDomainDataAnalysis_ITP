		<content>  Advertisements are usually about     
 people wanting to sell furniture,     
 houses and cars. Sometimes the sellers
 get alot of response, while others,   
 none at all.                          
  The languages in school are French   
 and German. All forms 1,2 and 3 take  
 French, while German is optional in   
 the  2 year.                          
  Schools are at Ty-Isaf(nursery and   
 infants). Junior with infants attached
 are at Danygraig, Ty-Sign and Risca   
 Town. There is  a comprehensive at    
 Ty-Sign/Rogerstone.                   
  Each school in the area give their   
 children different subjects, but they 
 should cover the important work_      
 Maths. and English. Risca
