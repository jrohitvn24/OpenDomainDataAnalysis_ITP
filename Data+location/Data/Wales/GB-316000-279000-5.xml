		<title>05    THE VILLAGE SHOPS</title>
		<content>  Both the villages in the survey area 
 have a village shop and post office.  
 They supply a wide variety of items   
 ranging from groceries to articles of 
 clothing, home-produced honey locally 
 made pottery and cylinders of gas. The
 village shops find it very difficult  
 to compete with prices in the chain   
 stores and supermarkets at nearby     
 Knighton and Newtown. Many people     
 travel to these towns for their weekly
 shopping although some realize the    
 importance of supporting the village  
 stores in order to retain them. At    
 these village post offices it is      
 possible to renew dog and television  
 licences, and to pay telephone bills  
 and water rates. Villagers are also   
 able to collect their pensions, child 
 benefit allowance, sickness benefit   
 and DHSS payment. Also on sale are    
 premium bonds and savings schemes.    </content>
