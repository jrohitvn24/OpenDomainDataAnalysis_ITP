		<title>10Margam Park.  The Orangery</title>
		<content> Arguably the finest example of late   
 18th century architecture in South    
 Wales, it was built for T.M.Talbot to 
 house a collection of trees acquired  
 in the previous century.  Designed    
 also as a gallery for statuary        
 collected on the 'Grand Tour', only   
 that of LUCIUS VERUS an obscure Roman 
 Emperor remains.  Prior to purchase by
 West Glamorgan County Council in 1973 
 the building was in a poor state of   
 repair and was subject to two years   
 restoration.                          
 The Georgian hypocaust was abandoned  
 with the result that orange trees     
 recently imported from Florida no     
 longer flourish but are grown in the  
 Citrus House.   Restored as part      
 function room, part Orangery it       
 provides a venue for the Margam Music 
 Festival, exhibitions and social      
 functions.                            </content>
