		<content>  The administration of the church     
reflects the history of the area.      
  Dixton Church dates from Celtic times
and was dedicated to St.Peter in Norman
times.Situated on the banks of the     
river Wye,the church was subjected to  
flooding in 1929,1947 and 1960.The     
living is held by Rev.B.Phillips who   
also is responsible for the nearby     
parish of Wyesham.Services are at 8.00 
a.m.(Holy Communion) and 11.00a.m.     
(Matins).                              
  In 1902 Dixton was allowed to vote to
return to the Diocese of Hereford.Saint
Cenedlan Church,Rockfield is also in   
the Diocese of Hereford although both  
are in the Welsh County of Gwent.      
  However,St. John's Church in the     
Buckholt is within the Diocese of      
Llandaf.Whether Church of England or   
Church of Wales,all services are held  
in English.                            </content>
