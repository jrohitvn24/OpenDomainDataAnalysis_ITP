		<title>06The Gt.Orme- Heathland</title>
		<content> Dominant on the Great Orme heathland  
 are the yellow{Common Gorse,}the      
 golden yellow{Western Gorse, Ling}and 
{Bell Heather.}These plants give       
 nesting cover for the{Stonechat}and   
 the{Goldcrest.                        
 There are 55{Feral Goats}on the Great 
 Orme.  These feed on the heathland    
 plants. They are descended from a pair
 of goats from the{Windsor Royal Herd  
 which were given to{Sir Savage Mostyn 
 around 1880. They roam around the Orme
 and frequently cross Marine Drive in  
 search of fresh pasture.  So elusive  
 are these goats that there are many   
 residents of Llandudno who have lived 
 in the town all their lives without   
 ever having seen them.
