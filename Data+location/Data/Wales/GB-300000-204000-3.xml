		<content>   My name is Priya Kumar,I am a Hindu,
 and I live in Castle Park, Merthyr    
 Tydfil.                               
   I was born in Oxford in Banbury     
 Cross.   My father is a doctor who    
 came to Britain in 1968, he works in  
 the Hollies Health Centre.   His name 
 is Dr. Aroon Kumar.   My mother's name
 is Parool and she doesn't work.       
   I am the second of three children.  
 The other two are boys aged 12 and 3. 
 My elder brother is attending a       
 boarding school in India, but now he  
 is on vacation.   The other brother   
 goes to the school nursery.           
   As Hindus, we have more religious   
 festivals than Christians, as we      
 worship one god who has lots of names.
 We eat English and Indian foods at    
 home, a typical Indian meal we have is
 rice, two or three vegetables and a   
 special dish of meat.                 </content>
