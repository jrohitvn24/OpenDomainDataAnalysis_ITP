		<title>17Leigh's Day at School</title>
		<content> School starts at 9.00 when I go down  
 to the hall for assembly. This        
 finishes at 9.30 and I do my maths    
 until 10.35. I then go out to play    
 football if the grass is not wet, but 
 if it is my friends and I just run    
 about.                                
 My favourite subjects are creative    
 writing, language and maths.          
 After playtime we do Welsh with a     
 visiting teacher. At lunch time I have
 my sandwiches and the lunch break ends
 at 1.30. Then we might have gym and   
 play rounders. Some other time it     
 could be Geography, History or        
 Science. I also like to use the       
 computer when it's in our class.      
 Afternoon break is at 2.35 and after  
 break we have music and then leave    
 school at 3.30 to go home again.
