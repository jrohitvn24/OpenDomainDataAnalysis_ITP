		<title>06CATTLE FARMING</title>
		<content>   Cattle are kept on the farms for    
 about 18 months and are then sold at  
 the livestock market in Abergele to   
 lowland farmers who can fatten them   
 for sale to the butcher more cheaply  
 on their better land with a milder    
 climate.                              
   The cattle, needing more and better 
 food than the sheep, are kept on the  
 lower fields which are more sheltered 
 and have deeper soils.                
   The area contains 45 working farms  
 and a number of smallholdings. One of 
 the farms in the area is 113 hectares:
 97 hectares are improved grass; 8     
 hectares are used for fodder crops; 8 
 are rough grazing on the highest land.
 During May the farm had 325 ewes, 338 
 lambs and 93 cattle.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
