		<content> The area consists mainly of           
 carboniferous limestone with a little 
 Silvnan shale on the Western edge of  
 the block.  Due to the porous nature  
 of limestone, rainfall readily drains 
 away. There are a few small streams   
 and in some places these disappear    
 underground through "Swallowholes"    
 e.g. at Hendre Fawr farm (Reference   
 772098). This underground water system
 is the source of a powerful spring    
 which emerges at a lower level at     
 "Marian Mills" (Grid Reference 075789)
 in the adjoining block. This spring   
 provides drinking water for the town  
 of Prestatyn four miles away. There is
 one lake in the block called "Llyn    
 Helyg", but this was artificially     
 constructed in the 17th Century       
 approximately for sport and           
 recreation.
