		<title>04Everyday Life in Salem</title>
		<content>  Until the spate of new housing in the
 village(Golwg y Gar, and main street),
 Salem was  traditionally  Welsh,   and
 thus followed a tradional way of life,
 the children speaking little but Welsh
 until starting school.    The original
 families still keep to the  Welsh way,
 their main meal being dinner at midday
 with tea at four (Welsh cakes and bara
 brith) and supper in the evening.  The
 incoming families,   because  the  man
 works away  from  home,  eat dinner in
 the evenings,   and rarely take tea or
 supper.   These families do not attend
 the chapel,   but usually churches out
 of the district,  and so the chapel is
 in decline. Salem chapel is Welsh non-
 conformist (Annibynwyr). It now has 32
 members, average attendance 20, and is
 used  only  twice monthly.   All other
 chapels in the area are now closed.
