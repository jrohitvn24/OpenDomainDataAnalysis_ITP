		<title>09SARAH MELLORS OF DEFYNNOG</title>
		<content>   I got up at 7.30, dressed, cleaned  
 my teeth and washed my face, then I   
 went down stairs and my dad made me a 
 cup of tea. When my mum came down she 
 brushed my hair then I got my bag and 
 went to school. After assembly I went 
 into class and did maths and library, 
 then the bell went and I went outside.
 I played hopscotch then 'it' (touch). 
 The whistle went so back in for more  
 lessons before dinner. After dinner of
 meat pie, peas and potatoes with      
 yogurt for sweet I played for a while 
 before more lessons and swimming.     
  After swimming I went to gran's and  
 we had dinner then she gave me a      
 packet of rolo and a drink of squash. 
   In the evening I read the BFG and   
 did a jigsaw. Then it was time to go  
 home have a wash and read a bit more  
 before going to bed.(27/6/85)
