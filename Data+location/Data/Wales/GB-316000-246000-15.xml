		<title>15THE NICHOLLS</title>
		<content>  Hayley Nicholls wrote of the life of 
 her mum on a quiet hill farm. She does
 not drive a car so the amount she gets
 out is limited. She has a grown up    
 family of three boys and one girl     
 living at home, this takes up much of 
 her time. She works an 18 hour day,   
 beginning at 6 AM. She likes to sew in
 her spare time. Most of her time      
 is spent at home on the 200 acre farm 
 which has at least 700 sheep and 65   
 cows. Some of her day is spent outside
 helping with sheep and chickens.      
  Mr Nicholls not only farms but enjoys
 fishing and motorbike scrambling with 
 his sons.                             
  It is difficult for the whole family 
 to go on holiday together because     
 someone has to stay behind to look    
 after the farm and the animals.
