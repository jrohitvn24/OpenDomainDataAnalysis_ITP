		<title>17SUNDAY SCHOOL - ATTITUDES</title>
		<content>   I go to Sunday School because I like
 hearing stories about God and every   
 year we go on trips.  Every Easter, we
 go to another Church for a special    
 service.  We have an Anniversary at   
 Harvest time and at Christmas we have 
 a play.                 (Ceri Morgan) 
                                       
   I have never been to Sunday School  
 before.  I don't want to go because   
 none of my friends go and I have      
 no-one to walk up with.  My Mam has   
 tried to talk me into going but I     
 decided not to. I prefer to go to the 
 park with my friends on Sunday.       
                        (Nicola Horton)
  I used to go to Sunday School, but   
 my Mam will not let me go any more    
 because I used to come home late. I   
 used to mess about on the way home. I 
 don't mind because it wasn't really my
 kind of school anyway.  (Alan Pearce) </content>
