		<title>08GULF REFINERY AND THE HAVEN</title>
		<content>    There is{1 pipeline}which runs     
 under the Haven from{Gulf to Texaco   
 which contains crude oil which is then
 put into the{Catalytic Cracking unit  
 and comes out as four different things
{1.}Light catalytic cracked naptha     
 known as L.C.C.N.{2.}Heavy catalytic  
 cracked naptha known as H.C.C.N.      
{3.}Alkylate.{4.}Cycle oils. These are 
{returned}in separate{pipelines to Gulf
 There is also{1 pipeline to Pembroke  
{Power Station}taking heavy fuel oil.  
    All the{water}used in the refinery 
 cannot just be dumped in the Haven    
 because it might contain oil.So first 
 it goes through 2 A.P.I.separators    
 which take out oil and solid. Then to 
 the final catch basin where it is     
 oxygenated before being returned to   
 the harbour.
