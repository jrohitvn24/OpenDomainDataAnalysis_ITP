		<title>14St.Davids Fire Station</title>
		<content> There are 11 part_time workers in the 
 fire station and 2 full time workers. 
 They are Jimmy Jones,and Barry Owen.  
 There are two kinds of false alarms in
 a fire station _ malicious and good   
 intent.Over the last ten years they   
 have recieved 78 good intent alarms   
 and 23 malicious alarms.The fire      
 engine is capable of going at 70mph.  
 Going to a fire the speed depends on  
 what the limits  are and how busy the 
 traffic is.The fire engine has never  
 broken down going to a fire.They have 
 only used breathing apparatus once,in 
 the Amoco disaster back in November   
 1983.In 1984 they had 104 calls and so
 far this year they've had 38 calls.The
 fire engine cost Â£33,000 and over     
 another Â£2,500 for breathing          
 apparatus,ladders..etc.The fire engine
 has 15 years in the force then it is  
 sold off.                             </content>
