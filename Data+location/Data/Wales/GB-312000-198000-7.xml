		<title>07SHOPPING - BARGOED AREA</title>
		<content>  Bargoed functions as a local district
 shopping centre with a catchment area 
 of smaller surrounding communities. It
 is an important centre for convenience
 shopping, with a decline over the last
 10 to 20 years in the sale of durable 
 goods. There have been few physical   
 changes in Bargoed's main shopping    
 streets since their growth at the turn
 of the century. With few exceptions   
 the units are small. There are 150    
 units. Only 11% are run by national   
 multiple companies e.g. Woolworths, a 
 further 11% are regional multiples,   
 leaving the vast majority as small    
 family businesses. This is probably   
 due to the inadequate size of         
 available premises and the physical   
 constraint of the town centre. Service
 outlets e.g. building societies have, 
 to a fairly large extent, replaced    
 rather than added to existing units.  </content>
