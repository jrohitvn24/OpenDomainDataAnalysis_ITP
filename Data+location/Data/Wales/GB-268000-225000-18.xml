		<content> Most of the land in our area is       
 farming land.In the Towy valley there 
 aren't many trees,but the land is     
 quite flat and is good for farming.The
 farmers mostly use the land for       
 growing grasses for the cows to graze 
 on.Up here near the school there are  
 more trees and the fields are steeper.
 Most of the trees are decidious oak   
 trees,there are a few sycamore,beech, 
 ash and firn trees about,but not many.
 Round the Towy valley and here the    
 cows are used for milking.Up on the   
 Garn most of the cows are used for    
 beef.The soil up on the Garn is poor, 
 and there is not much grass.Up there  
 mostly there is bracken and other     
 types of ferns and low grasses.There  
 are hardly any trees on the Garn      
 because the soil is so poor and       
 windswept.Sheep are bred on mostly    
 mountain slopes.                      </content>
