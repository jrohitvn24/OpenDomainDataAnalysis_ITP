		<content> At the Northern edge of our block is  
 the Asda superstore.It lies about 2   
 miles outside Merthyr town centre near
 the head of the valleys road.As out of
 town shopping is new to the area we   
 decided to carry out a survey to try  
 and answer 3 questions.               
 Q1.How far people travelled to the    
 store?                                
 Q2.How often did they shop there?     
 Q3.Which of these reasons tells why   
 they use the store?                   
 a)Better quality food.                
 b)Cheaper prices.                     
 c)Free bus service.                   
 d)Cheap petrol.                       
 e)Late opening (open until 8pm.).     
 f)All round shopping in one store.    
 We made a questionnaire and asked a   
 100 shoppers to fill it in.           
 The result to Q1. was that 58% of     
 shoppers lived 3 to 5 miles away.     </content>
