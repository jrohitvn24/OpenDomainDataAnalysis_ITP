		<title>14BODFARI FARM_ MAKING SILAGE</title>
		<content> On any farm the feeding of the animals
 is very important.On a dairy farm the 
 quality of the milk is dependant on   
 the health of the cattle.During the   
 warmer months the cattle graze in the 
 fields,supplemented by 'cake'         
 containing 16% protein .During the    
 winter months the herd is kept indoors
 and fed on silage.                    
         Silage is made in summer when 
 the grass is cut.It is usually cut in 
 the afternoon when the sugar is at    
 its highest.It is left for twenty four
 hours before being collected into big 
 bales which weigh about half a ton.   
 These are then stored in large plastic
 bags and will be used as winter feed.
