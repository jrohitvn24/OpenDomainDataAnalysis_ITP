		<title>10Bilingual Education.</title>
		<content> This area shows the dramatic growth of
 bilingual education. The Welsh nursey 
 school Ystum Taf, one of 30 in        
 Cardiff, has 29 pupils compared with 8
 when opened in 1972. This school      
 feeds Melin Gruffydd school, one of 4 
 Welsh primary schools which is now 6  
 yrs old. They have grown from 60 to   
 220 pupils during this period. In     
 both schools only approximately 30% of
 the pupils come from Welsh speaking   
 homes.                                
 All pupils go to Glantaf              
 comprehensive. This, the only Welsh   
 secondary school in S. Glamorgan,     
 shows a growth from 99 to 920 pupils  
 in 8 yrs. This year A-level exams are 
 being taken for the first time. Pupils
 come from all over S. Glam. All       
 subjects are taught through the medium
 of both Welsh and English.
