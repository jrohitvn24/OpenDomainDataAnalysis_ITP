		<title>15 THE RIVER DEE.</title>
		<content> FLOWING THROUGH OUR VILLAGE IS THE    
{RIVER DEE.}IT IS THE THIRD LONGEST    
 RIVER IN WALES.THE FIRST AND SECOND   
 BEING{THE SEVERN}AND{THE WYE}.THE DEE 
 STARTS AT BALD LAKE AND FLOWS         
 EASTWARDS THROUGH LLANGOLLEN,INTO     
 CHESHIRE AND ON THROUGH CHESTER.ONCE  
 IN CHESTER IT TURNS ABRUPTLY NORTH AND
 FLOWS IN THE DIRECTION OF LIVERPOOL   
 WHERE IT BECOMES AN ESTUARY AND FLOWS 
 PAST THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF{THE WIRRAL 
 AND IT THEN FLOWS TO{THE IRISH SEA}.  
 ONE OF THE MANY VILLAGES IT PASSES    
 THROUGH IS{HOLT}.THE RIVER DEE HAS    
 BECOME VERY INDUSTRIALISED.THIS IS    
 BECAUSE OF THE POINT OF AYR COLLIERY  
 AND THE COAL HAVING TO BE TRANSPORTED.
 BECAUSE THERE WERE NOT THE HEAVY GOODS
 LORRIES THAT THERE ARE NOW,BARGES HAD 
 TO BE USED.THESE ARE STILL USED TODAY 
 IN SOME PLACES BUT THEY HAVE BEEN     
 SLOWLY PHASED OUT AS THE LORRIES      </content>
