		<title>07FARMING, LAND TENURE</title>
		<content> The great majority of farms are       
 occupied by their owners and, indeed, 
 a few of them have remained in the    
 same family since the mid-nineteenth  
 century or even earlier.              
 A particular feature of this area is  
 the extensive tract of land which was 
 formerly part of FFOREST FAWR - the   
 Great Forest of Brecknock - which had 
 been a Crown Estate until the early   
 nineteenth century.  Through long     
 usage, those farming adjacent enclosed
 land has acquired grazing rights on   
 the Great Forest,together with certain
 other rights, notably that to work    
 limestone on the outcrops of Carbon-  
 iferous Limestone in the upper Tawe   
 valley.In 1819 an Enclosure Act alloc 
 -ated a large part of the land to the 
 Crown, this depriving other farms in  
 the area of their grazing rights. The 
 land was known as the CROWN ALLOTMENT.</content>
