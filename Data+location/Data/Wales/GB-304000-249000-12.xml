		<title>12LLANELWEDD VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Llanelwedd is a small village one     
 mile outside Builth Wells. There is   
 quite a large church and a Primary    
 School with about 60 pupils.In the    
 school grounds,there is a large new   
 Community Hall called Jubilee Hall    
 where many dances are held and clubs  
 and societies meet regularly.Nearby   
 is a very large quarry which can be   
 seen for miles.  Llanelwedd is famous 
 for being the home of the Royal Welsh 
 Show for four days every year.The     
 showground employs quite a large      
 number of people and is used for a    
 number of other events during the year
 such as dog shows and sheep sales.    
 There is a small council estate near  
 the school as well as a few older     
 houses. Just in front of the council  
 houses is a small field where swings  
 and a few other play-things for       
 children have been erected.           </content>
