		<content> The Gower coast is an area of great   
 natural beauty,people flock to the    
 beaches every summer.Most of them stay
 in caravans,chalets,hotels or a just  
 day trippers.                         
    There are lots of interesting      
 things to do such as climbing,walking,
 swimming,caving,water-skiing,surfing  
 and hang-gliding.These are some of the
 many outdoor sports activities that   
 you can join in,there are also many   
 gentler pursuits.You can visit one of 
 the many castles and churches that are
 in the area.Some fine examples of     
 these are found at Oystermouth,Penrice
 and Pennard.                          
    At Cefn Bryn you can take a walk   
 and see King Arthurs'Stone,another    
 relic to strengthen the claim of Wales
 to the ancient legend.                
    We are very lucky to live so near  
 to this area of natural leisure.      </content>
