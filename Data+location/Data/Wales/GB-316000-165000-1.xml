		<content> The area we surveyed is 84% sea.The   
 sea is polluted and there are         
 dangerous currents.To the east of the 
 area there are cliffs.The beach is    
 mostly bedrock but there are patches  
 of pebbles and sand particularly in St
 Mary's Well Bay which is a tourist    
 attraction.On Sully Island there are  
 traces of an iron age fort.There are  
 fast running tides especially over the
 causeway.                             
    Facing the Island is the Captain's 
 Wife pub which is popular for young   
 and old.Nearby is one of Wales' fine  
 restaurants and Hotel,The Sully House,
 set in a secluded coastal position.   
 To the east is the Glamorgan Nature   
 Reserve which, due to the large       
 variety of plants growing there is    
 deesignated a Site of Special         
 Scientific Interest.
