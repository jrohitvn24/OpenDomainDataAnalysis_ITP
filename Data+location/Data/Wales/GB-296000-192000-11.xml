		<title>11BRONLLWYN HOME FOR THE AGED</title>
		<content> "Bronllwyn," the twenty fifth purpose 
 built Home was constructed at a       
 contract cost of Â£95,260.             
 The building accommodates 36 residents
 in 24 single and 6 double bedrooms.   
 Although the ground floor units are at
 different levels, the corridor areas  
 have been gently ramped to avoid the  
 necessity for any steps within the    
 home.                                 
 A communal dining room, spacious,     
 light and conveniently located can be 
 extended to form a large hall suit-   
 able for the many concert parties, who
 regularly volunteer to entertain the  
 residents.  The dining room is served 
 by a modern kitchen equipped with the 
 latest labour saving devices and      
 appropriate cooking equipment,        
 including a ten gollon bulk water     
 boiler with a direct water connection.
