		<content>     {Brymbo Steelworks}is situated    
 about two miles west of Wrexham.      
      The factory produces high quality
 low alloy and special carbon          
 steel.Much of the steel is exported.  
 The steel is used by vehicle          
 manufacturers.The factory also        
 produces steel for drills and bits for
 oil rigs;and heavy chains for the     
 mining industry.                      
      In 1787 John Wilkinson came to   
 Brymbo to make iron.He chose Brymbo   
 because here there was iron ore in the
 ground,limestone and coal.He found,too
 that the people of Brymbo were hard   
 workers.                              
      Iron has now changed to          
 steelmaking.                          
      The Steelworks is owned by       
 Guest,Keen and Nettlefolds.           
      Many parents work at Brymbo      
 Steelworks.                           </content>
