		<content>            My Sunday                  
On Sunday morning I get up early and   
play with my brother until Mummy and   
Daddy get up.Then we have some         
breakfast together and Daddy takes us  
swimming.Mummy stays at home and cooks.
We meet our friends in the pool and    
play together.After we come home from  
swimming we have dinner.My favourite   
Sunday dinner is Yorkshire pudding with
Roast Beef.In the afternoon if it is   
raining we play games like snooker,    
board games or computer games in the   
house.If it is nice weather we go out  
somewhere,to the river or the park or  
somewhere interesting.Sometimes we take
a picnic with us.After tea we see if   
there are any children's programmes we 
like on television.Then my brother and 
I have a bath and get ready for bed.
