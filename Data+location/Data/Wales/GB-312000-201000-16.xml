 around Â£400 _ Â£450.                   
  They have a variety of machinery,    
 Tractor, Bailer, Mower, Hay Bob and a

 buildings, including 1 barn, 2 cow    
 sheds, 2 loose boxes, 1 stable, a     
 chicken cot, a tool shed, an implement
 shed and a sheep dip which is used in 
 July to kill ticks. All farms have

 exception with mice, foxes, stoats,   
 weasels, rabbits and the occasional   
 mole.                                 
  Other animals are chickens and geese.
