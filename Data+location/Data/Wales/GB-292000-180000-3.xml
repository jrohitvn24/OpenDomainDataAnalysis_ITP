		<title>03HOME LIFE OF SIMON WILLIAMS</title>
		<content>   I wake up at 7.45a.m. I have        
 breakfast at 8.00a.m. I have corn-    
 flakes everyday. I dress about ten    
 past eight for school. I put my home- 
 work in my bag. I leave the house at  
 8.30 and arrive at school at 8.34. I  
 have a lift to school by car. We go up
 to prayers at 9.00a.m. We sing songs  
 and  are told many bible stories by   
 our Headmaster Mr. Stone.  We then    
 have Mental Arithmatic and we do Alpha
 and Beta Mathematics. At half past ten
 we go out to play. At l0.45 we go back
 in doors to do English. We then have  
 dinner at l2 o'clock and play in the  
 yard. Later on we have environmental  
 studies, craft or science. We then    
 have play. We watch television, read  
 or listen to poetry for the last half 
 hour. We then go home.
