		<title>15The new Marina in Swansea</title>

{The decline of the docks created a lot
{of empty waste space.} When the       
 foreshore development plan was started
 one of the ideas was to create a{yacht
{marina}in the old South Dock basin.   
 A lot of new building has taken place 
 giving a very attractive area with the
 marina itself, new flats and most     
 recently some new shops.              
 The new flats are very popular and    
 although expensive sold very quickly. 
{The council is encouraging people to  
{visit and use the marina by providing 
{the shops, amusements and restaurants.
 They also hope that yacht owners will 
 use the marina.  Last year the Welsh  
 Boat Show was held in Swansea Marina  
 for the first time.
