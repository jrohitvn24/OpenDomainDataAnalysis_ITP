		<title>09FARMING : SWANSEA WEST</title>
		<content> Farming in our area is mainly         
 concentrated along Cockett valley. The
 valley runs approx. East to West and  
 so only the Northern farms have a     
 favourable aspect. Cefn Coed-bach Farm
 is of 8 Ha with 4 Ha being improved   
 grassland. This is a dairy farm with a
 small herd of 15 milking cows,a       
 mixture of Freisians and Jerseys,     
 using a milking machine and           
 refridgerated storage. As a result of 
 milk quotas, production has been      
 reduced and now there is some cattle  
 fattening instead.Elsewhere,poultry,  
 sheep and horses are kept and some    
 fields with a sunnier aspect are sown,
 often with oil-seed rape. Soils are   
 generally loamy,drained by virtue of  
 the slope. The farms are a mixture of 
 tenanted and owner-occupied.
