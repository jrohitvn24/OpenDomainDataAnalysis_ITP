		<title>20Gelliwion Forestry</title>
		<content> The first tree was planted in         
 Gelliwion forestry in 1955.The conifer
 trees growing are the Douglas Fir and 
 the Western Fir,which grow in bracken 
 soil,and the Scots Pine and the Norway
 Spruce,which grow in mineral soil(the 
 mineral here being the coal in the old
 coal tip).Around the edge,the Larch   
 grows in the stony soil and this tree 
 turns brown in Winter.The birds found 
 in the forestry include the Crows and 
 Magpies at the foot of the forest,the 
 woodpeckers among the larches,the wood
 pidgeon and the owl,and at the top of 
 the forest the Gold Crest.The animals 
 include field mice,grey squirrels,    
 foxes,stoats and badgers.The first    
 pair of badgers were brought from West
 Wales.Adders are also found.The forest
 workers made a paved walk-Martins Walk
 -which leads to a pond and picnic     
 area.(Angela Jones-Hafod school)      </content>
