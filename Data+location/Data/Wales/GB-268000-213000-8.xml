		<content> The area in general is very poorly    
 served by the health authority.       
 Within the 12 square kilometers of the
 block there is{only one doctor's      
{surgery. }This surgery is in Lower    
 Brynamman.  It is served by one doctor
 only.  The only addition to this      
 service is a{rota system}which        
 operates at{weekends and evenings     
 aided by doctors from neighbouring    
 areas.                                
 There is no dentist or optician       
 practising within the block though    
 there are surgeries in the            
 neighbouring towns.                   
 The villages within the block are     
 served by a{district nurse and        
{midwife.
