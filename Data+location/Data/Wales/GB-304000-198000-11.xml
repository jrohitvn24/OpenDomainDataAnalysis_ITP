		<title>11THE WORKING DAY OF A MINER</title>
		<content> My father works at Penrhiwceiber      
 colliery.He works on three different  
 shifts,mornings afternoons and nights.
 When he is mornings,he gets up about  
 4.45 and has a cooked breakfast.He    
 then goes down the road to catch the  
 works bus or sometimes he has a lift  
 with his mate.                        
 He 'clocks in' and gets his equipment 
 and goes down in the cage to the coal 
 face.My father works on the coal      
 cutting machine and it is very hot,   
 noisy,dirty work.                     
 At the end of the shift he returns to 
 the surface and goes to the shower    
 room to wash all the dirt and dust    
 off.He then changes into his day      
 clothes and catches the bus back home,
 and spends the afternoon having a nap 
 or takes the dog for a walk.
