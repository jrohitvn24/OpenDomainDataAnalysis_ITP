 THERE ARE TWO PLACES OF WORSHIP.      
 ONE IS A WELSH PREBYTERIAN CHAPEL     
 CALLED MAMRE. THIS CAUSE WAS BEGUN IN 
 1843. THE MEMBERSHIP IS NOW DOWN TO A 
 DOZEN. THE CHAPEL ITSELF   ABUTS AN   
 EMPTY CHAPEL HOUSE, BUT IS A ROBUST   
 BUILDING. IT EVEN HAS A SMALL         
 GALLERY.THERE IS NOT A MINISTER AT    
 PRESENT.                              
 THE CHURCH IN WALES OR ANGLICAN       
 ESTABLISHMENT IS EQUALLY WEAK, WITH   
 SPARSE CONGREGATIONS. THERE IS NO     
 VICAR AT PRESENT. SUPPORT FOR THE     
 CHURCH IS ALMOST WHOLLY ENGLISH AND   
 INCOMING OR FOREIGN.                  
 THE SUNDAY SCHOOL IS HELD IN THE      
 SCHOOL AND HAS A MARKED EVANGELICAL   
 TENDENCY.. SUPPORT IS SMALL AND       
 LESSENING.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
