		<content> The wetland area near the estuary is  
 washed clear of mud by water escaping 
 through sluice gates from a pond      
 called Condi's pond.The pond fills at 
 high tide when the sluice gates are   
 open.Local people go fishing at       
 Condi's pond.Fishing is a popular     
 hobby and occupation for some of the  
 local people.Their rowing boats are   
 moored on the estuary.Many children go
 riding their bicycles near the        
 wetlands.We call the waste ground the 
 "cob"We go scrambling on our bicycles.
 When the tide is out,it is possible to
 cross the estuary from the Welsh side 
 to the English side(Wirral) by        
 walking.Great care is needed when     
 walking across the sand.Fog can come  
 down quickly.People have lost their   
 way without a compass.The distance is 
 approximately 5 mls.The estuary has   
 been crossed in 20 minutes.           </content>
