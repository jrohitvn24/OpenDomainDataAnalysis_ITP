		<title>09BUILTH (W) : HOUSING</title>
		<content>  Builth (W) is the newer part of the  
 town of Builth Wells.                 
  The older houses date from about     
 1900.They are often stone built,and   
 with slate roofs.Several of them are  
 three storeys high and follow a       
 pattern of ribbon development.        
  Council estates were built at Western
 Grove,and at Pendre,soon after the    
 Second World War.There ,houses are    
 generally semi-detached.              
  The 1970's and early 80's saw the    
 town undergoing rapid peripheral      
 expansion.High cost housing,especially
 bungalows,is typical.This latent      
 expansion reflects retirement into the
 area,also movement of buisness people 
 out from above shop flats,and the     
 expansion of local government in      
 nearby Llandrindod Wells.
