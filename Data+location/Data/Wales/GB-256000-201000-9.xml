		<content>{Pontarddulais}is a small community    
 with a very strong musical tradition. 
 Today in 1985 it can boast five       
 choirs; one male voice choir with 120 
 members, one mixed choir, two female  
 choirs and a youth choir.             
 The male voice choir is well known    
 throughout Great Britain and has      
 travelled extensively overseas and is 
 always in great demand. It has on many
 occasions won at the National         
 Eisteddfod of Wales, as has one of the
 ladies choirs, Cor Duffryn Dulais.    
 They specialise in Welsh traditional  
 songs and cerdd dant, a vocal form    
 peculiar to Wales. The Aelwyd youth   
 choir also has gained a number of     
 successes in competitions.            
 There is also a{Pontarddulais}brass   
 band who currently compete in Section 
 B of the National Brass Band          
 Competition.                          </content>
