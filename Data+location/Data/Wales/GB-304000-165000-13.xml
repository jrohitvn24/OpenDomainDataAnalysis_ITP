		<content> During the period after the First     
 World War the only industry was the   
 Cement works.                         
 A lot of the housing was built by the 
 Cement Works for their employees.     
 The bulk of the accomodation in the   
 village during this period was made up
 of council housing and the property   
 built for the Cement Works. Private   
 housing extended along the length of  
 the main road running East to West    
 through the village known as {        
{Fontygary Road.}                      
 The outlying areas of the village was 
 agricultural land.                    
 For a full account of what the area   
 was like before industrial development
 we suggest you consult a book called..
