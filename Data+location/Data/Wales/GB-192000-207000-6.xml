 Tabernacle Chapel Rosemarket was built
 in 1831.It serves members of the      
 United Reform Church.Early in the     
 century over a hundred people attended
 services.Now there are only six       
 members. A service is held every      
 Sunday afternoon. The chapel has no   
 minister but Rev.D. Morgan of         
 Tabernacle, Milford Haven preaches    
 once a month.The organist has been a  
 regular member for over seventy years.
 No young people go to chapel and the  
 members believe it may not be very    
 long before Rosemarket Chapel closes  
 altogether.They feel very sad about   
 this but they are probably right.
