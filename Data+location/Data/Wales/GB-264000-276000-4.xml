		<content> The farms are small varying from      
 25-100 acres &amp; have been in the family
 for many years. Small farmers rent    
 land to increase their acreage while  
 others keep their small &amp; and also    
 have other jobs. Some farmhouses are  
 lived in by people other than farmers 
 who could live up to 40 miles away.   
 Very often the occupiers act as       
 caretakers. Farms are mainly sheep and
 store cattle and milking herds,       
 depending on their on their positions.
 There is a minority interest in       
 horses. Hay, silage, barley &amp; Swedes  
 are grown for animal  fodders. Nearly 
 every farmer turns part of a field    
 over to potatoes &amp; vegetables &amp; hens  
 for family use. Help is always        
 available from neighbours (farmers &amp;  
 others) when hay making &amp; sheep       
 shearing &amp; dipping are to be done.
