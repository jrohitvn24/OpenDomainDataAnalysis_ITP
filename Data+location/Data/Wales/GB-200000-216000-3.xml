		<title>03THE WISTON BASILISK BY C.T.</title>
		<content>  Long ago there were many people who  
 said that the Wiston Estate belonged  
 to them.SO,someone came up with the   
 idea that there should be a           
 competition.                          
    Not very far away was a hole in the
 bank where the Basilisk lived.        
  The Basilisk was black and           
 yellow,between 1 and 2 feet long and  
 it had eyes in the back of its head as
 well as the front. People would die if
 the Basilisk saw them and it would die
 if you saw him first.But that never   
 happened.  On with the                
 competition,anyone who managed to kill
 the Basilisk they would inherit the   
 castle. Many people tried and were    
 killed.ONE man came up  with the idea 
 of going downhill in a barrel and look
 at the Basilisk before he was         
 spotted.He succeeded and killed him   
 and inherited all of WISTON ESTATE.   </content>
