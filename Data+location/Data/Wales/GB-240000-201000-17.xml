   Clyndu Farm (34acres) has been      
 farmed for a hundred years, but today 
 it is a Riding School.It was opened in
 March 1978.There are twenty horses and
 ponies. The horses include thorough-  
 breds, Shetlands, Welsh-Mountain      
 ponies, Hunters and Welsh cobs.       
    Children, adults, organizations    
 including the Pony Club, Local Schools
 and Break Thro use the riding school. 
    Mrs Vaughan Jones, the owner,      
 dresses as Father Christmas every year
 and rides down to Pembrey School. All 
 the children 'look out' for Father    
 Christmas and there's great excitement
 when he comes into view. Ben,the horse
 is an important guest at the party and
 is fed many tasty tit bits.           
    Christmas wouldn't the same in     
 Pembrey without Father Christmas and  
 Ben.                                  </content>
