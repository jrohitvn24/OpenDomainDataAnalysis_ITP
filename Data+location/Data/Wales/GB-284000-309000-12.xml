		<content> Farmers undecided about advantage of  
 EEC consider it to involve excessive  
 paper work. High price of land means  
 static family farms only. Speed &amp;     
 volume of traffic on new main road    
 causes problems when driving animals. 
 Longing for older simpler days of     
 farming. Villagers dislike low flying 
 military aircraft &amp; presence of       
 nuclear bunker at Blaenplwyf Uchaf.   
 Religious hold on older villagers is  
 strong. No wish to cater for English  
 speaking Christians who must go else- 
 where. Since closure of slate mines &amp; 
 school village life less lively.      
 Sometimes lack of communication       
 about village events. No pub wanted.  
 Little organised for young people or  
 children.Excessive street lighting in 
 village. Car rallies are of little    
 interest to villagers, leave rubbish, 
 are noisy &amp; dangerous through village.</content>
