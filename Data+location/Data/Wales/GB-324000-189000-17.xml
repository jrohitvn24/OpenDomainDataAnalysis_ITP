		<title>17TY SIGN JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is for 7 to 11 year olds.  
 It has 11 classes having from 20 to 35
 pupils in each. It is quite modern,   
 having been open since 1968, and has  
 14 classrooms altogether. There are   
 about 330 pupils in the school.       
 It has quite a lot of equipment such  
 as computers, TV's etc.               
 There are two wings to the school,    
 each with two stories and in between  
 there is a hall and a kitchen. The    
 hall is big, with a brown tiled floor.
 There are two main doors and two not  
 so important ones.                    
 Every classroom has lots of windows   
 and at least two blackboards.         
 The children in the school live in    
 council houses and private ones. When 
 we leave this school we go up to Risca
 Comprehensive which is about a mile   
 away. I like our school.
