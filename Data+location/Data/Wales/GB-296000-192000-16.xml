		<title>16PREHISTORIC SITE</title>
		<content>   High up on a mountain called "Mynydd
 Y Gelli," overlooking the old Gelli   
 Colliery Site is Hen Dre'r Gelli (a   
 prehistoric town). There are the      
 remains of an Iron Age Hut settlement,
 Bronze Age Stone Circle and a burial  
 cist. It was excavated by the Rhondda 
 Naturalist Society between 1902 and   
 1905. Many things were found there    
 including fragments of pottery, Bronze
 Age axes and flint arrowheads.        
   The inhabitants were called "Beaker 
 People."  They buried their dead      
 singly in a crouched position in Round
 Barrows, placing a beaker or drinking 
 vessel alongside the dead chieftain.  
 The exact position of the Site can be 
 found on Ordinance Survey Map grid ref
 erence 977 940 (sheet 170) or by      
 taking the Glyncornel Centre Walk     
 Trail (number 7) on the Scenic Walks  
 Fact Sheet (Number 3).                </content>
