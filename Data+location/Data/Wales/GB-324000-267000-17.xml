		<content> There are two Church in Wales churches
 within the block - one at Whitton and 
 one at Pilleth. Not many people go to 
 church and there are not usually more 
 than ten at Whitton. Pilleth church is
 open only in the summer because it is 
 high on a hill and can be cold and    
 draughty in the winter - it has no    
 electricity. The churches are full at 
 special times like Harvest or Easter  
 or Christmas. The Rector at Whitton   
 has to look after several different   
 parishes. There is a Baptist chapel   
 two miles away and people go there    
 from this area. It is a struggle for  
 the churches to keep going although   
 they get a lot of tourists going in to
 have a look round with many coming    
 from abroad.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
