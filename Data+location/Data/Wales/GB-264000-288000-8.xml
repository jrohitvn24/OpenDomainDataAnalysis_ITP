		<content> FARMING IN TALYBONT AREA CONTINUED    
 The cows are out in the Summer and    
 over the Winter they are in the sheds 
 I have to scrape cow muck out of      
 the sheds every morning in the Winter 
 and give them hay and cow nuts.       
 There is a very active Young Farmers  
 Club at Talybont with a membership of 
 about eighty members who attend the   
 club every week. The highlight of the 
 year is taking part for the club in   
 the annual Rally.                     
 The rally was held this year at       
 Penparc which is in the South of      
 Ceredigion.Talybont were fortunate to 
 be the outright winners from the 30 or
 so clubs taking part. The Ceredigion  
 Rally next year will be held at       
 Talybont and that will involve a lot  
 of work for us young farmers of       
 Talybont.
