		<title>06TOURISM The Marble Church</title>
		<content> One of the best known attractions on  
 the North Wales coast is the Marble   
 Church at Bodelwyddan.It is known as  
 the "Marble Church" because of the    
 varieties of marble used in its       
 interior construction .               
 Built of local limestone,the church   
 has a spire which rises to a height of
 202feet and this can be seen  many    
 miles away down the vale.             
 Tourists who visit the church are     
 struck by its outstanding beauty .The 
 exquisitly carved lectern in the      
 form of an eagle perched on a rock    
 with both wings outspread, and the    
 Pulpit which is a fine example of     
 English wood carving of the Nineteenth
 Century both fascinate visitors to the
 church.                               
 Throughout the year the church is open
 to visitors and many thousands enter  
 through its doors annually .          </content>
