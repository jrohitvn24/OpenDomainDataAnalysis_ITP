		<title>08CLUB CARNIVAL TONYREFAIL</title>
		<content> Every summer the four clubs in        
 Tonyrefail save up money and organise 
 a carnival.It is held in the meadow   
 park. There are always many rides such
 as the Octopus, Roundabouts and the   
 Umbrella ride. There is also a huge   
 bouncy castle for small children to   
 jump upon.                            
   They sell lots of food and drink.You
 can buy hot dogs, ice cream and       
 candyfloss.They also hold a fancy     
 dress competition for anyone to join  
 in. The winner has a prize of Â£3.00   
 This year there were three winners    
 in the competition.                   
    They also have sports.They have    
 lots of different races such as Throw 
 The Welly,Sack Race,Sprint,Three      
 Legged Race and a BMX competition.    
 The winners receive a cup or a medal. 
 I think the carnival is great and I   
 look forward to it every year.        </content>
