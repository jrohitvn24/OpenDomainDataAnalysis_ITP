		<content> On the 15th July 1959, the mayor of   
 Newport,Councillor Edwin Aston laid   
 the Foundation Stone of our           
 school,which was named Milton Junior  
 school.It is a state school,run by the
 Government and the local authority.   
 Most of our teachers are in the       
 National Union of Teachers(N.U.T.).One
 is in the National Association of     
 School Masters and Union of Women     
 Teachers(N.A.S./U.W.T.) and one isn't 
 in any union.                         
             The class teacher who has 
 been here the least length of time has
 been here for seven years and the     
 longest for over 20 years.Our school  
 which has children from 7 years to 11 
 years of age has been divided into  7 
 classes since a teacher retired last  
 month after twenty-one years at this  
 school.                               
                                       </content>
