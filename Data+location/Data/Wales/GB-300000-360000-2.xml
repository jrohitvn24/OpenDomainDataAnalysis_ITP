		<title>02LIFESTYLE IN NANTGLYN.</title>
		<content>    The villagers were happy with life 
 in Nantglyn, except that they wanted a
 village shop and a better bus service.
 The only village facility is the sub  
 post office.Most of the older         
 residents spoke Welsh as their first  
 language and a popular pastime was    
 watching Aled Jones the soprano on S4C
    The oldest man in the village(71)  
 was born in Nantglyn. At that time the
 roads had no hard surfaces,but the    
 village was much busier with the forge
 open and a thriving store. The house  
 he now occupied had been an inn but it
 was bought and closed by the chapel in
 the 1920s.He had run the Post Office  
 and agricultural stores. It took two  
 people all morning to deliver the     
 mail.The village is much quieter today
 but he prefers it that way.
