		<title>12Tal_y_Bont Village</title>
		<content>       Tal_y_Bont is two miles south   
 east of Bangor; it is a fairly small  
 village &amp; there is a nice friendly    
 community atmosphere amongst the      
 people. Most of the people live in the
 new housing estate that was built in  
 1973. People shop for ordinary things 
 e.g.bread,milk,eggs, in the local     
 post office which recently moved three
 houses further down the road. Most    
 people have a car &amp; go to Bangor or   
 Llandudno to shop.                    
       Around the post office the      
 houses are mainly built from local    
 stone &amp; slate but a few yards up the  
 road there is the housing estate where
 the houses are built from cement      
 bricks &amp; blocks with slate roofs.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
