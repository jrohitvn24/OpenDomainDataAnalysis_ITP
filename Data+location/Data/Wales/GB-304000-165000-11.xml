		<content> The area to the western boundary of   
 the survey has the larger of two      
 caravan parks in an area known as     
{Fontygary.}There is a swimming        
 pool, as well as tennis courts, a shop
 and a club-house to be used by guests.
 This also is served by a flat,sandy   
 beach. The{tides}which are prevalent  
 in the Bristol Channel however make   
 unsupervised swimming a dangerous     
 occupation. There is therefore a well 
 established{Surf-Lifesaving Club}which
 meets once a week in the winter and   
 every day in the summer. They         
 specialise in two rescue techniques.  
 Firstly, they use surf canoes and     
 secondly the more obvious beach rescue
 techniques a la BONDI Beach!          
 The club sends competitors each year  
 to the World Surf Lifesaving          
 Championships and has built up a very 
 good reputation.                      </content>
