		<title>13Visitors to the Eryrys area.</title>
		<content>  This is a pleasant rural area of     
 outstanding natural beauty, inviting  
 to people wanting to get out into the 
 country. The whole area is crossed by 
 lanes, tracks and footpaths. There    
 are several tracks through the woods  
 on Nercwys Mountain.                  
  There are a few holiday cottages and 
 also two small caravan sites for      
 visitors. Off the Pant-du road near to
 Tir-y-coed woods is a hut used as     
 accomodation by ramblers groups,      
 particularly from the Merseyside area.
 Just to the north west of the block is
 Maeshafn Youth Hostel providing       
 accomodation for 2000 visitors each   
 year, some from abroad, some from     
 Merseyside clubs, many visiting the   
 block to walk and cycle and by car.   
  Local people visit the area by car   
 and to walk. The tracks are used by   
 horse riders.                         </content>
