		<title>13St.Davids Lifeboat</title>
		<content> The lifeboat station for St Davids is 
  in St Justinian.The lifeboat is      
 called the 'Joseph Soar' but they may 
 be getting a new and better lifeboat. 
 The coxwain is Freddy John who takes  
 trips round Ramsey Island.Ramsey Sound
 is one of the most dangerous places   
 on the coast and this is where most   
 accidents happen.The St Davids area   
 where the lifeboat covers is from     
 Fishguard to Angle.A few weeks ago a  
 tanker ran aground and the oil which  
 spilled out killed many Puffins and   
 Giuillemonts.The lifeboat(which went  
 out)was covered in oil.It was washed  
 with special chemicals.Water came from
 R.A.F.Brawdy in a fire engine.After   
 every call out the lifeboat must be   
 washed down,ready for the next time it
 is needed.Some of the crew are Rex    
 Lewis,Norman Rowley,Keith Jones,Ken   
 Braders and my dad Malcom Gray.       </content>
