		<content> In his younger days community life    
 centred around the chapel,with        
 people congregating there on most     
 evenings for various activities.The   
 other meeting place was the           
 blacksmith's forge situated on the    
 site of the present days "Bridge End  
 Inn."Today's meeting place are the    
 same but fewer people attend the      
 chapel and the Inn has replaced the   
 forge.                                
 During the last two decades,motor     
 transport has made the area less      
 isolated and the inhabitants make     
 daily journeys to the local town of   
 Fishguard for work,school and         
 shopping.There aren't any shops in    
 Llanychaer.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
