		<title>14Traffic Congestion Llanrwst</title>
		<content> This is a constant problem in         
 Llanrwst, lying as it does on the road
 from the new coastal expressway to the
 A5 through Betws y Coed. At present   
 all traffic must pass through the town
 which has a narrow main street further
 hampered by a dog-leg bend. Large     
 lorries constantly use this road and  
 those with wide and very long loads   
 need an escort of motor police. Plans 
 have been put forward to bypass the   
 town, the more likely of which will   
 have serious impact on the cattle     
 market and the local senior school.   
 The Bont Fawr (Big Bridge), built in  
 the 17th century was designed for a   
 horse and carriage. It is a hump      
 -backed bridge, and on-coming cars    
 cannot be seen from either direction. 
 A traffic control system operated     
 until recently but failed to provide a
 suitable answer.                      </content>
