		<title>17FARMING</title>
		<content> The main industry around Usk is       
 farming of{crops, cattle and sheep.}  
 The area is  a good livestock area.   
 It grows fine crops of grass, this is 
 because the soil is of old red        
 sandstone with a reasonable rainfall. 
 There are also some cereal and potato 
 crops grown in the valley.These       
 are somewhat restricted though by     
 flooding of fields near the river.    
 This happens on average about 3 times 
 a year.The livestock are kept for milk
 and meat production. Several herds of 
 friesian cows produce milk.Some of    
 these cows are crossed with beef      
 breeds e.g.{Hereford}and{Charolais,}to
 produce calves which are reared and   
 fattened for{beef.}There are large    
 numbers of sheep on the slopes above  
 the valley. These are mainly hill type
 breeds of animal e.g.{Welsh Mountain} 
 and{Radnor Hill.                      </content>
