		<content>      In our area there are two primary
 schools one secondary school and one  
 tertiary college.Secondary education  
 is based on the comprehensive system  
 and the one school has approximately  
 1200 children ( this is our school ). 
 The primary schools form just part    
 of the feeder schools to our large    
 comprehensive, the other three are    
 outside the area and many of the      
 children have to be bused to school.  
      The tertiary college is to open  
 in 1986 and will be housed in what is 
 now the technical college. It is      
 intended to cater for as wide a       
 spectrum of needs as is possible for  
 all its 16+ pupils, whether they be   
 in the technical or tertiary sections.
      Besides these educational        
 facilities there are also two play    
 school goups.
