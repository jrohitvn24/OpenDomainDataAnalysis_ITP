		<title>09The Mumbles Train</title>
		<content> The Mumbles biggest claim to fame is  
 that the first passenger carrying     
 railway in the world (1807-1960) ran  
 from Swansea to Mumbles.Initially laid
 for the movement of limestone,iron ore
 and coal from local quarries etc. to  
 industrial Swansea. It will be best   
 remembered for the side to side       
 rocking motion of the cars as they ran
 the five mile journey along the most  
 beautifully curved bay in the         
 country,beginning with horse-drawn    
 tram-cars,the railway tried           
 sail,accumulator,petrol,diesel and    
 finally electric cars capable of      
 carrying 107 seated passengers.The    
 memory of the line is kept alive with 
 a working model in OO guage made and  
 exhibited by the Oystermouth Model    
 Railway Club,and by the Mumbles       
 Railway Society who are striving to   
 have the line reinstated.             </content>
