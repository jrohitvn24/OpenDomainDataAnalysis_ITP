 In the Summer I will go swimming in   
 the sea, it is as warm sometimes as in
 the swimming pool. I go fishing in the
 harbour for bass and pol1ock and I'll 
 fish the River Aeron for salmon and   
 sewen. I might get a summer job for a 
 week or two then I will spend all the 
 money in the shops. I will have to do 
 some gardening as well, and get       
 firewood.

 The only activity I will be doing in  
 the Summer is swimming and playing    
 tennis.I might go down to see one of  
 my friends who lives by the River     
 Aeron. I will go down to see the tug  
 of war across the Harbour. One of my  
 cousins was in it one year but he did 
 not fall in (worse luck!). In the     
 summer there will be no room to park  
 the car for miles and it will be noisy</content>
