		<content> Outside at the back of the house there
 would be a semi-permanent construction
 or "outhouse" in which mother would   
 store various items. The toilet would 
 be a free standing structure near the 
 house. These terraced houses          
 originally belonged to the employer of
 the people living in them. Today      
 however most are privately owned and  
 have been modernised in the form of   
 extensions to the original structure  
 enabaling bathrooms and toilet        
 facilities to be brought indoors.     
 The second type, the council house    
 built post-war to replace the more    
 delapidated housing pre-war. These    
 council owned properties were built as
 estates varing in size from small i.e.
 twenty houses to vary large i.e.one   
 thousand plus. These had larger rooms 
 advanced plumbing and toilets, gardens
 and outhouses.                        </content>
