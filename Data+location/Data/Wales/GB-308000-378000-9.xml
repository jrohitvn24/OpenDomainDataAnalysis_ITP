		<title>09RELIGION IN TRELAWNYD</title>
		<content> Trelawnyd has two active chapels and  
 one church.  As elsewhere, there is a 
 decline in the number of regular      
 churchgoers.  The largest regular     
 congregation is at the St.Michaels and
 all Angels Church which was built in  
 the l3th century, and numbers about   
 25.  This Church shares its incumbent 
 with the adjoining parishes of Cwm and
 Dyserth.                              
 The Vicar resides in Dyserth , and the
 Vicarage has been privately sold.  The
 Church was re-roofed in l983 at a cost
 of Â£l3,000.  This repayment of a loan 
 for this work and a heavy quota of    
 Â£1,500 places a large financial burden
 on the members.  The chapels are      
 suffering from a decline in the number
 of welsh speakers and their           
 congregations are slowly diminishing. 
 In l984 thE Wesleyan Chapel was       
 closed.                               </content>
