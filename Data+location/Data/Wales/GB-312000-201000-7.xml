		<title>07The history of New Tredegar.</title>
		<content> Until a few years ago New Tredegar and
 the Deri Valleys were mining          
 communities.There used to be 5        
 collieries in the area Elliot's East, 
 Elliot's West,White Rose coal level,  
 Groes Faen and Oglivy.The last of     
 these Elliots West closed in 1967.    
  Upon Brithdir mountain there was a   
 church called The Capel which was     
 burnt down a few years ago.There is a 
 cross to mark the place where it once 
 stood.There is also a Roman road      
 across the top of this mountain from  
 Tirphil to Fochriw.There are 8 chapels
 and 1 church now in use.              
  At Sunnybank Road Dr. McMillan had a 
 doctor's surgery.When Dr. McMillan    
 died a monument (A clock) was erected 
 to his memory. The clock stands in    
 Elliot Square Elliot Town.Lord Elliot 
 owned most of the property in the     
 district hence the name Elliot Town.  </content>
