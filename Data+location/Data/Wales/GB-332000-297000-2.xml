		<title>02Childrens feelings of Centre</title>
		<content> I have been to the Centre twice. I    
 think it's great. We have salad and   
 spagetti bolognese. It's good because 
 we go to Nipstone Rock and Rock       
 Cottage.                              
 All the time you are in Sirs command  
 and that is fun for all. I think the  
 Centre is great and the best part is  
 when we get wet and tell jokes in our 
 chalets. Peter got wet the most       
 because he was nearest the flaps for  
 the door used to open when the wind   
 blew. I used to laugh at him and he   
 used to cry. It's brilliant when it   
 rains. I like sleeping it is ace.
