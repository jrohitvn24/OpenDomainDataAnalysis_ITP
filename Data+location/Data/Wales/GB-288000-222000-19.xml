		<title>19INDUSTRY,CRAY RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> Cray Reservoir dates from the first   
 decade of the twentieth century, when 
 the upper part of Cwm Crai was dammed 
 to form a reservoir to provide water  
 for the Swansea Water Company.        
 The dam is a steep masonry dam with   
 a row of holes through which excess   
 water escapes when the reservoir is   
 full.  Although this supply may have  
 been sufficient for the needs of      
 Swansea in 1907, the size of the urban
 area has increased immensely as also  
 the demand for water.  Consequently   
 Cray Reservoir hasd become too small  
 by the nineteen forties so that after 
 the war, Usk Reservoir was also built.
 By the late sixties this, too, was in-
 adequate so that the Llyn Brianne     
 scheme was also developed.            
 Nevertheless Cray Reservoir is still  
 part of the overall water supply for  
 the Swansea connurbation.             </content>
