		<title>02    Changes in Cwmbran</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Lewis, who has lived here for  
 30 years, came to tell us about the   
 changes in Cwmbran. Once there was    
 only a lot of farms and the old       
 village, but then houses, shops and   
 factories were built and slowly lots  
 of the farms disappeared. That made   
 Mrs. Lewis very sad because the       
 country walks went too.               
   Improvements were made by taking    
 away clay holes and putting in flower 
 gardens; filling in a pond and making 
 a boating lake.                       
   I think Mrs. Lewis preferred the old
 village, where she knew everyone, but 
 she thinks we are lucky to have sports
 grounds and leisure centres. She also 
 thought the health facilities were    
 much better now, because 30 years ago 
 there was only one doctor and the     
 dentist came once a week.
