		<content>  {Mr Sinnet Jones}lives at{Brynglas,  
{Llangeitho. He does not}farm the      
 land now.A few years ago he had cancer
 and had a major operation. He decided 
 after recovering that he would like to
 sail. He built himself a boat.He kept 
 it in the harbour at{Aberaeron.       
   He then amazed everyone by sailing  
 to{South Africa}and back.He thought   
 that he might not sail so far again   
 but then decided that he would build  
 a new ship and sail round the world.  
   So he and a friend started to build 
 two boats at Brynglas.They worked for 
 over two years and then the boats were
 ready to be taken down to the sea.    
   Mr Sinnet Jones has visited the     
 Llangeitho School to talk to them     
 about his voyage.
