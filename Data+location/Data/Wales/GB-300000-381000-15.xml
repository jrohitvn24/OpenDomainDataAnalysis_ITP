		<title>15EISTEDDFOD PROCLAMATION RHYL</title>
		<content>  During August 1985 the home of our   
 National Eisteddfod will be Rhyl and  
 District. The Eisteddfod will be held 
 on the outskirts of Rhuddlan, 3 miles 
 from Rhyl. This site was the only one 
 acceptable to the organisers and the  
 police who will have the difficult    
 task of controlling all traffic.      
  The 1985 National Eisteddfod was     
 proclaimed 12 months ago by the       
 Gorsedd of Bards. The proclamation    
 took place within the Gorsedd Circle  
 on the promenade. This circle consists
 of 12 stone pillars. A large flat     
 topped stone, known as the "Maen Llog"
 lies at the centre of the circle and  
 provides a platform from which the    
 Archdruid conducted the ceremony.     
 Facing it is the stone of the Covenant
 at which the Herald Bard stood. Behind
 this are the Portal stones which were 
 guarded by Eisteddfod officials.      </content>
