		<title>12The village of Trehafod</title>
		<content> Trehafod is a village between Porth   
 and Pontypridd.The two River Rhonddas,
 joined at Porth,flow through the      
 middle.Many of the houses are built in
 the valley between the two mountains, 
 while the rest are built on the       
 mountainside.Many of its buildings are
 between 80 and 100 years old.People   
 have been modernising their homes     
 which are strong stone buildings.     
 However,many of the shops and all of  
 the chapels-except St Barnabas Church-
 have closed.It was a busy mining      
 village but now the last colliery,the 
 Lewis Merthyr,has closed.People have  
 to travel to other places to work. It 
 is also a much quieter place because a
 by-pass has been built alongside the  
 railway.Through traffic to the Rhondda
 now uses the by-pass instead of the   
 village.
