 It is interesting to compare the      
 settlement pattern  in the area with  
 that shown on the original drawings   
 (made at a scale of two inches to one 
 mile) by the Ordnance Survey in 1814. 
 This was the source from which the    
 first edition of the One Inch to One  
 Mile map was prepared and published in
 1831.  Another important source map is
 the Tithe Survey map of the parish    
 which dates from 1840.Copies of all   
 these maps are held in the National   
 Library of Wales in Aberystwyth.      
 Of the 33 places depicted on the maps 
 of this area, 25 still exist and have 
 the same or a similar name;and only 8 
 have disappeared.  In more than a     
 century only two new farms have been  
 built and we know that this followed  
 enclosure of the Great Forest of      
 Brecknock after the Napoleonic Wars.  </content>
