		<title>07House Types.</title>
		<content> Yesterday afternoon all our class drew
 the types of houses that you would    
 find in our area.The types were as    
 follows:Bungalows-Detached-Semi       
 Detached-Flats-Terraced-Cottage.      
 We then conducted a survey of the     
 house types that the children lived in
 from our class.The result was as      
 follows:Bungalow        1 child.      
         Detached        3 children.   
         Semi Detached   13  children. 
         Flats           1 child       
         Terraced        10 children.  
         Cottages        0 children.   
 This seems to give a fairly accurate  
 view of the house types to be found in
 our block.There are mostly            
 semi-detached houses and terraced     
 houses.The terraced houses are the    
 oldest types next to the cottages.They
 are built out of Pennant Sandstone    
 which was quarried locally.           </content>
