		<content>  Lots of games are played by 5 to 7   
 year olds. Their favourite is{TAG}.   
  This is how you play{IT.}            
  Someone is on{IT}they face a wall and
 count to ten. They turn around,if they
 see anyone with their feet on the     
 ground they run to tag them. If they  
 don't tag them they then try to find  
 someone standing on a step.The person 
 on the step has to run. If they stay  
 where they are, they are now on{IT}.  
{THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TAGS:        
{Chain Tag},where those caught join    
 hands;{Witches Glue Pot},when those   
 caught are sent to "prison",and{Stuck 
{in the Mud},when those tagged can be  
 released from the tag by someone still
 free crawling through their legs.
