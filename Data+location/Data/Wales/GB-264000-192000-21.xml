<title>21LC Swansea</title>
<content>

Swansea Leisure Centre closed in 2003 which resulted in the loss of a major wet weather visitor attraction and a major facility in which families and people of all ages could enjoy a range of recreational activities. Following a review of the options, the Council decided that the refurbishment of the Leisure Centre was the most effective option and works soon progressed in developing the former site into a 21st Century leisure complex.&lt;br />&lt;br />Rebranded and revitalised LC opened its doors in March 2008. Paying tribute to the old centre HRH The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh came to Swansea once more to open the facility. There is plenty to do for everyone with the slides and wave machine in the waterpark, an aquatic themed play are and a state of the art gym. There is still a large sports hall at the LC which is currently being used as a Paralympic training ground ready for London 2012.   &lt;br />
