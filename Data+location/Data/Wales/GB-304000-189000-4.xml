		<title>04Shopping at Pontypridd</title>
		<content> Pontypridd is the main shopping centre
 of the Taff-Ely borough.Taff St,the   
 main shopping street,has a one-way    
 traffic system.There are a few small  
 family-owned businesses and many      
 famous name stores such as Woolworths,
 Boots,Marks and Spencers.Recently, the
 main hotel(New Inn)was demolished to  
 make way for additional stores-Chelsea
 Girl,Dolcis,WHSmith and others.       
 Wednesday and Saturday are Market days
 at Pontypridd with open air stalls    
 lining the streets-stalls selling     
 sewing materials,jewelry,clothes,     
 bed-linen,crockery,leather goods. The 
 market attracts crowds from           
 considerable distances.There are plans
 being considered for a new-look town  
 centre which will enable pedestrians  
 to walk freely and so avoid some of   
 the traffic problems which now exist.
