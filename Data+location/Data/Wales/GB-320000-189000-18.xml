		<content> The area offers a mixture of industry 
 and beauty spots,one of which is the  
 Scenic Drive whose seven mile length  
 winds its way through forested slopes 
 to give views of the Severn estuary.  
 There are children's play area,picnic 
 sites,barbeque areas and forest walks.
 The mountains around Crosskeys not    
 only enclose the traditional spirit of
 the valleys - the terraced houses,the 
 pits and the dialect _ but also give  
 scope for hill walking,easy or fairly 
 strenuous.A relatively new attraction 
 in the area is the 13 mile trek over  
 the Islwyn mountains.                 
 Although there are villages,the area  
 is predominantly rural.Bus services   
 are frequent and convenient but for   
 the tourist who is interested more in 
 the landscape,a car is advisable.Even 
 then one must be prepared to walk -   
 usuallly uphill-to see the best sights</content>
