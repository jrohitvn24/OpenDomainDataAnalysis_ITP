		<title>19NEWLAND WITH REDBROOK</title>
		<content> The church has played an important    
 part in the life of our villages for  
 many hundreds of years.Until about a  
 hundred years ago this parish included
 not only{Redbrook}but places such as  
{Clearwell, Bream, Coleford}and{Christ-
{church.}Before other churches were    
 built people from a large part of the 
{Forest of Dean}and{Wye Valley}went to 
 the{Church of All Saints,}at{Newland, 
 for church services and special       
 occasions like weddings and funerals. 
 This church was begun in about 1200.  
 Later additions were made including a 
{Clearwell Chapel,}a chapel (now the   
{Lady Chapel)}from which priests went  
 to miners in the Forest, and the      
 church porch with a room above which  
 was used as a school.                 
 Recently restored, this church is open
 for prayer, meetings, thanksgiving,   
 concerts and exhibitions.             </content>
