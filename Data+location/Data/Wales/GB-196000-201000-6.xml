		<title>06COSHESTON AREA - HOUSING</title>
		<content>    Cosheston is an old village which  
 still has some old cottages. There is 
 also a small council estate.          
   Until a few years ago, most         
 Cosheston people lived in these two   
 types of house. Then Cosheston grew   
 popular as a place to live for people 
 who worked outside the village and    
 many modern private houses were built.
 Most of these houses are much more    
 expensive than houses in nearby       
 Pembroke Dock.                        
   Most people, however, live in quite 
 new houses, either on a private       
 housing estate or in private houses   
 and bungalows.                        
   Of the 17 children we interviewed in
 Cosheston village school, 8 lived in  
 detached houses, 5 lived in bungalows,
 2 in semi_detached, 1 in a cottage and
 1 in a terraced house. The Cosheston  
 population in the 1981 Cenus was 582. </content>
