		<content>      Only three telephone boxes were  
 found in this area, one in the        
 village of Pontantwn, one in the      
 village of Meinciau, the other was    
 situated on a minor road between B4309
 and B4306.  Population here is sparse.
 The telephones found at Pontantwn and 
 Meinciau are situated on the B4309    
 Pontyates to Carmarthen road.  Most   
 farms have their own telephones.      
      There is no Post Office in this  
 area.  Post boxes were found at       
 Pontantwn and Meinciau.  This area is 
 made up mainly of farms, therefore,   
 the population has to commute to the  
 nearest village with a Post Office to 
 buy stamps, post letters etc..        
      It is only in the last few years 
 that the Meinciau and Pontantwn Post  
 Offices closed.
