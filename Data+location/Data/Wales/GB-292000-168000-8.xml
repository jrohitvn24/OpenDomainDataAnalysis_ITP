		<content>  The area that we looked at was almost
 all fields.It is said to be one of the
 best agricultural areas around. The   
 fields in our block usually were      
 growing grass or cereal crops.The     
 grass was either for grazing cattle or
 for turning into hay and sileage.The  
 cereals were mainly barley and        
 wheat,though there were potatoes,peas,
 and rape seed oil crops.              
  There were 20 farms and most of them 
 farmed in similar ways i.e.cereals and
 beef but 5 had dairy herds and some   
 had sheep.Summer is the busiest time  
 for the farmers,with hay,sileage and  
 harvesting crops to be done.Most of   
 the farmers buy their calves at       
 markets,rear them and fatten them,and 
 then sell them again at market.The    
 local market for livestock is         
 Cowbridge.Barley is sold to other     
 farmers and wheat sent to the mills.  </content>
