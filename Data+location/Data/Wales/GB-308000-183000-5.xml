		<content> When living in a town, the tranquility
 of village life can see attractive.   
 People are friendlier. There is a     
 "community spirit". There are numerous
 activities based on the centre of the 
 village, the village hall. They do not
 have to content with the polution,    
 the hustle and bustle, and the        
 violence of the town.                 
 Of course, it has its drawbacks. There
 is very little local employment and   
 there are few shops making personal   
 transport essential. A newcomer       
 without a car and being used to       
 ammenities on the doorstep can feel   
 very isolated in rural areas.         
 Youngsters can feel very out of place 
 when they are suddenly faced with     
 making their own entertainment. On the
 whole however, people adjust and in   
 most cases moves from town to village 
 work out and become permanent.        </content>
