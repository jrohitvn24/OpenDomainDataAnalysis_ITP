		<title>03Transport Network Nantgarw</title>
		<content> Nantgarw is surrounded by a transport 
 network system which provides evidence
 of an important industrial area.      
 The two dismantled railway lines that 
 run to the north and south of the     
 residential area of Nantgarw may be   
 due to the decline in the mining      
 industry.   There is still, however, a
 mineral railway line running through  
 the area.   A comparatively small     
 residential area, consisting of mainly
 council houses, is situated to the    
 north of the mineral line.   It       
 appears to be purpose-built for       
 employees of the nearby industrial    
 estate.   The main form of transport  
 is now provided by the roads A4054;   
 A468; and the A470(T) forming a link  
 to the Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil,       
 Pontypridd, Newport and other valley  
 areas.
