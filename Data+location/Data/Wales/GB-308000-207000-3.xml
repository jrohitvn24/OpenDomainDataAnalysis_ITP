		<content> Open cast mining is taking place to   
 the North of Dowlais Top where the    
 Coal Measures surface.The continual   
 pounding of the Earth's surface has   
 produced an almost{lunarlike landscape
 A colossal{bite}has been taken out of 
 the mountainside where the machines   
 have been following the coal seams    
 down from the surface.However,the land
 that is now being mined consisted of  
 the slag heaps and spoil tips,remnants
 of a once thriving iron industry.After
 the coal has been extracted the land  
 is then landscaped and seeded and it  
 is hoped that eventually the scarred  
 landscape will return to its          
 pre-industrial shape which was mainly 
 deeply wooded valleys and unspoilt    
 moorland.Opencast mining appears to be
 rather a{messy}style of extraction    
 There is constant activity often day  
 and night,by huge lumbering machines  </content>
