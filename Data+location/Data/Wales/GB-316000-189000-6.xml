		<title>06Typical Valley Industry</title>
		<content> MidGlam Packing Supplies is typical of
 small industries that we interviewed  
 at the Nine Mile Point Industrial     
 Estate.The manager informed us that   
 his firm occupied Unit 30 in 1982 when
 regional grants were available,and    
 because workers didn't need any       
 special skills,there being only six   
 people in the factory 2 of which were 
 local.His industry was oil based,as   
 polythene was extruded into whatever  
 shape was required.He said that       
 selling depended on finding people to 
 buy his products in the larger towns  
 and cities after much effort.The site 
 was easily accessible,his only problem
 was cashflow as the industry cannot be
 helped anymore locally.We asked what  
 he enjoyed about his job.He answered, 
 "Being boss-but seriosly the          
 satisfaction of selling my products." 
 The least enjoyable,"Not selling!"    </content>
