 ------Saturday June 1st PM------      
 At 1.00pm we went home and my mother  
 fed Elizabeth and my dad went to play 
 cricket in Neath. After Elizabeth had 
 been fed and changed, we went to a    
 fete with my Auntie at Killay         
 Childrens home. At the fete I won a   
 money box and a belt, then I had a    
 hotdog. At 4.30pm the fete ended. When
 we arrived home my mother fed         
 Elizabeth and then she went to sleep. 
 At 5.30pm my aunt and uncle called    
 around with my two younger cousin     
 Cathy and Gareth. My dad came home    
 from cricket at 7.30pm. We set the    
 table for tea and then at 8.30pm we   
 had tea. After tea my brother and I   
 went upstairs to play. At 9.30pm I    
 started to do my homework. After doing
 my homework I went to bed at 10.30pm. </content>
