		<title>04PORTHMADOG LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>  The landscape of this area is varied.
 There is the urban area of{Porthmadog}
 -the focal point of the region -with  
 its single long shopping street and   
 rows of terraced houses branching off 
 it.Along the coast of the estuaries   
 can be found sandy beaches and coastal
 dunes which shift and change with the 
 winter storms.Behind these on the SW  
 are the deciduous oak woods of        
{Borth-y-Gest.}The{Porthmeirion        
 peninsula to the east consists mainly 
 of moorland with some rough           
 pasture.Finally,behind the retaining  
 wall of the{Cob}(the embankment across
 the Glaslyn estuary) is land reclaimed
 from the sea in the early 19th        
 century. This still floods easily and 
 is basically marshland. We are        
 surrounded by Earth's beauty:moorland,
 woods,rocks,rivers,the estuaries and  
 the sea.                              </content>
