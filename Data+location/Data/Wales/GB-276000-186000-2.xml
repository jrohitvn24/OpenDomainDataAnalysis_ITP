		<content>      Within our area there are        
 several recreational and leisure      
 activity centres.We have two main     
 youth clubs and six public houses /   
 social clubs for the older generation.
      Just outside the area we have a  
 sports centre which is situated by the
 beach and caters for our sporting     
 needs.One of the things we don't have 
 is a cinema. There were several in the
 area but they have all been closed    
 over the past few years. There is one 
 small public park where one can walk  
 or play pitch and put.Besides this we 
 have 3 sports fields where one can    
 play rugby, cricket or soccer.        
      The situation could be improved  
 with the inroduction of a wider       
 variety of activities.
