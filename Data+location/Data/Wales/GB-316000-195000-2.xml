		<content>       I live with my mother and father
 and I have three pets, two cats and a 
 rabbit.                               
       My mother does the washing in   
 the automatic washing machine, and    
 the ironing which she hates although  
 she has a steam iron. Dad and I dig   
 and put plants in the garden while    
 mother cleans the car.                
       We buy our food from the        
 Supermarket monthly and keep it in a  
 fridge-freezer. Every Sunday we have  
 cooked dinner,in the week we have fast
 foods cooked in the microwave oven.   
 Occasionally we go to a take-away     
 shop for fish and chips.              
       In the evening my father and I  
 read. I use my computer, and my mother
 watches television. Every Thursday I  
 go to a young fellowship club where   
 girls play rounders and boys play     
 football.                             </content>
