		<title>09My Summer Holidays</title>
		<content> I'm not sure why I looked forward to  
 these holidays so much.After all,now I
 don't see so much of my friends and   
 Newport is terribly over-crowded it is
 almost impossible to go shopping.     
 Last year was such fine weather we    
 were on the beach nearly every day    
 swimming,diving at Cwm,on the Club    
 canoes,windsurfing,then crab-fishing  
 at Parrog to finish the day.I'm glad I
 play golf now because this summer is  
 terrible.                             
 We had a band playing in the Carnival 
 this year.I've seen some exciting boat
 races,the Bay race,the River race and 
 the Long Boat races - Newport has the 
 best crews in Wales!                  
 We had a fantastic Firework display   
 last night organised by the Regetta   
 people.Now the visitors are going     
 back,and I'm going back to school     
 Tuesday.                              </content>
