		<title>08Way of life in Bwlchysarnau</title>
		<content> This is a very close-knit community   
 with only 6 families having moved into
 the area since the 1970's(all English)
 Most of the families in this area are 
 related to each other, sometimes      
 several times over. Relations are very
 important to people and they are      
 identified firstly by where they live 
 and, secondly, by whom they married or
 whose cousin they are. Everyone knows 
 all their obscure relatives, even as  
 far removed as possible.              
    Many marriages have taken place    
 between the offspring of neighbouring 
 farmers, even recently, although the  
 search for education and employment is
 broadening peoples' horizons, along   
 with the motor car. But even now most 
 of the children tend to stay in the   
 area as they grow up and settle down, 
 although some have gone to university 
 and then they tend to move away.      </content>
