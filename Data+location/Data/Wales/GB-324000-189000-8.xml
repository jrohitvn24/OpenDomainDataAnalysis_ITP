		<content> To explain our leisure time we would  
 really have to start where we relax _ 
 our entertainment. That means tele-   
 vision, radio, vidios, newspapers and 
 other reading materials, if we really 
 want to be quiet there's the local    
 library. From information received    
 from the above media, we have realized
 that for all of us to lead a full     
 healthy life, we have to have an      
 active pass time.This varies on your  
 age, at our school it means all sport 
 activities, swimming, rugby, soccer,  
 running, netball, hockey etc. You need
 equipment for some games like a ball. 
 different sizes of balls are used. A  
 big ball for netball and football and 
 a smaller ball for tennis. Cricket is 
 played with a wooden bat and a hard   
 ball called a corgi.While adults seem 
 to have taken up jogging with aerobics
 for women and some men enjoy rugby.   </content>
