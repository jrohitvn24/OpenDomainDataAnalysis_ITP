      The building was originally a    
 chapel,built by the Calvinistic       
 Methodist Church in 1791. It has also 
 been used as a market and a school    
 room.                                 
              Since 1974 it has been   
 renovated, being maintained by the    
 Rhymney Valley District Council. It is
 now used as a{community centre}and run
 by a voluntary management committee.  
              Occasional religious     
 meetings and concerts are held and    
 there are between four and six        
 exhibitions staged there each year.   
             A nursery for pre-school  
 children is held from Monday to Friday
 during the school terms.              
             The centre is also used   
 for union meetings, craft fairs and   
 public meetings.                      </content>
