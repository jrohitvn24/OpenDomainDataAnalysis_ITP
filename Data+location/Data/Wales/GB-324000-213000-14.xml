		<title>14FARMING A DAIRY FARMERS LIFE</title>
		<content> I get up at 6.30 a.m. and milk my herd
 of friesian cows.After milking I turn 
 them out to pasture and then wash and 
 clean the parlour.At 8.30 a.m. I have 
 breakfast prepared by my wife who will
 by now have fed the young calves and  
 collected fresh eggs.The routine of   
 the rest of my day depends on the     
 weather and season.In June I am       
 concerned with fattening lambs for    
 sale at Abergavenny Market.I also     
 shear the sheep and send the fleeces  
 to Brecon.After shearing,the sheep    
 have to be dipped to kill off maggot  
 eggs.Dipping is hard work.I may spend 
 the rest of the day spraying weeds and
 fertilizing the fields for a hay crop.
 I have already planted potatoes and   
 swedes.I milk the cows again at 4.30  
 p.m. I arrive home at 6.00 p.m. and   
 retire to bed at 10.00 p.m.
