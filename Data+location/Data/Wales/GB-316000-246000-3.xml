		<title>03INFANT CARE</title>
		<content>  Expectant mothers are cared for by   
 the GP in Hay, Builth or Knighton.    
 Families tend to use the GP base of   
 past generations but newcomers go to  
 Hay. Clinics are now available for    
 weekly help. There are maternity wards
 at Hereford, Brecon and Builth        
 hospitals. A health visitor visits    
 within 48 hours of the mother         
 returning home. Few babies suffer real
 illness and in the past 10 years none 
 have died. There is no official       
 midwife in the area. Parents look     
 after the little ones but it is the   
 mothers responsibility for the hour to
 hour care. Dad often cares for        
 children in the evening so allowing   
 young mothers to join clubs and       
 classes. Grandparents often live      
 nearby and play an active part in many
 childrens lives. They support them    
 well during their primary school life.</content>
