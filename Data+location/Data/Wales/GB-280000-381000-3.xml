		<content>{Pennrhyn Bay} lies at the foot of the 
{Little Orme} about a mile from the    
 sea. A survey of the{residents}showed 
 that most found it peaceful, safe,    
 fairly clean and they liked living    
 there. Fred has lived there for a long
 time and seen many changes.  "Before  
 the new houses were built it used to  
 be a {farm.}I preferred the farm. I   
 like seeing animals about rather than 
 people.                               
{Trams} used to run over the hill from 
 Colwyn Bay to Llandudno West Shore.   
 Some had no roof, called the {        
{Toastracks}- alright in nice weather  
 but of course when it rained everybody
 got wet through. They stopped them    
 after the war. They didn't pay."
