 We split into five groups,four of the 
 groups went with Mr Rees and our group
 went with Miss Clift.                 
 We started off by going down a lane.  
 We stopped at the end of our grid     
 along side a sign which said{Bentlass.
 Our group looked mostly at farming    
 land.Rough grazing was the most common
 farmland.                             
 We started back up the lane and met   
 Mr Rees.Mr Rees and Miss Clift talked 
 for a couple of minutes,then our group
 started going the way that Mr Rees had
 gone.                                 
 We walked on and then turned into a   
 lay-by and looked up a lane,then we   
 crossed the road and saw a football   
 and cricket pitch.
