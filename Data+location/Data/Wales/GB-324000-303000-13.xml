		<content> Our area is very hilly, and this makes
 travelling difficult, especially in   
 winter. The school bus fails to       
 collect pupils off the top of Long    
 Mountain during bad weather because of
 the very steep bank. Years ago        
 children walked miles to and from     
 school. Our parents remind us of that 
 awful day when the school bus crashed 
 into the orchard near the Post Office 
 as it careered down the bank out of   
 control. It was a miracle no-one was  
 killed. That was in 1952.             
      Along the very top of Long       
 Mountain there is a Roman road. The   
 drovers used this route regularly to  
 get their cattle to the big markets in
 England. They often used mountain     
 routes to avoid paying tolls at the   
 toll-gates on main roads. The old inn,
 the Welsh Harp, where the drovers     
 rested overnight can still be seen.   </content>
