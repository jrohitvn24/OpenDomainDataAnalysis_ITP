		<title>05Houses in Heol-y-Cyw.</title>
		<content>  The houses in our village are mainly{
{semi-detached or terraced.}Around the 
 village the houses are old,{detached }
 farmhouses and cottages. These mainly 
 date back to the rural community of   
 the last century and before.          
  The{terraced}houses were built at the
 beginning of the century to house the 
 growing number of miners and their    
 families.                             
  The{semi-detached }houses were mainly
 built by the local council before and 
 since World War 2. A limited amount of
 private building has also taken place 
 during the last 10 years.             
  Many houses are now owner-occupied   
 and the terraced houses have been     
 extensively renovated. Many have      
 central heating and almost all have   
 bathrooms and indoor toilets.
