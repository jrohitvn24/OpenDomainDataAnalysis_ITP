		<content> South of Heol Senni the steep western 
 side of the valley is covered with    
 patches of deciduous scrub            
 interspersed with areas of bracken.   
 Gazing by sheep prevents any regenerat
 -ion of trees.                        
 Maps dating from the late nineteenth  
 century show that the whole of the    
 steep face of Fan Frynych was  wooded 
 at that time.  This was felled during 
 World War I.  A few residual clumps of
 European Larch and other conifers     
 indicate that these can flourish as   
 high as 550 metres despite exposure to
 the prevailing winds.                 
 Below this slope there is a small     
 Forestry Commission plantation of     
 conifers which dates from the nineteen
 fifties.
