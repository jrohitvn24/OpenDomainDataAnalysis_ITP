 Carved slates are something that are  
 unique to our area because of the     
 slate quarries.In the old days when   
 the quarrymen were building their tiny
 cottages they could not afford tiled  
 fireplaces so they took some slate    
 slabs and carved various patterns on  
 them.They designed and even made their
 own tools.A lot of the designs are    
 geometrical shapes drawn in a         
 pattern,but some are very crude       
 drawings of local scenes.We had an    
 exhibition of these slates in school  
 and the local archeological society   
 have made a catalogue of them.Some    
 houses have the original slate        
 fireplaces still in them.
