		<title>16THE COMMUNITY COUNCIL</title>
		<content> Before 1894 local authority rested    
 mainly with the Church and Vestry,    
 together with bodies such as the      
 Sanitary Board. The Government Act of 
 that year instituted "Parish Councils"
 to take charge of local affairs - but 
 with very little finance. Then the    
 Local Government Act of 1972 changed  
 the situation so that from 1 April    
 1974 there came into being the        
 "Community Council" with many new     
 powers and rights, including the      
 vetting of planning applications. The 
 limitations on spending were also     
 greatly eased.                        
 Hundleton Community Council has nine  
 members including the Chairman - at   
 present Mr Graham Rowlands. It aims to
 enable the views of ordinary people to
 influence administration, - to "oil   
 the environment's wheels, making a    
 smooth and enjoyable community."      </content>
