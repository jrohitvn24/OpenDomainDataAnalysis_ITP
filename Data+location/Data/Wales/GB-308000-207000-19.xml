		<content>  Rhymney is a good example of a Welsh 
 valley community founded upon by-gone 
 industries of iron,coal and brewing.T-
 races remain in small mines,a Welsh   
 Parish Church built by a brewer, a    
 dozen public houses and clubs and a   
 new  History Museum.A small attractive
 park provides rugby,cricket,soccer,   
 bowls and tennis.A golf club and      
 lofts for racing pigeons also offer   
 outdoors activities.A comprehensive   
 school gives education up to A level  
 and in the winter has a wide range of 
 evening classes.Centres are in        
 constant use for social concerts,guild
 meetings,scouting and guiding.Culture 
 is encouraged by the Silurian Male    
 Choir,an Art Society,a Youth Band,a   
 library and many bi-lingual churches  
 and chapels.Rhymney is well served by 
 frequent trains from Cardiff and also 
 local buses.                          </content>
