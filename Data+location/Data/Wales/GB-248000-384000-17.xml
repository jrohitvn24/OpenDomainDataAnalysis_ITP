		<title>17MOVING OUT OF MOELFRE</title>
		<content> We moved to Moelfre from Bristol when 
 I was two because my father found a   
 job here as a clerk. I have been      
 living here for eight years and I have
 made a lot of friends. My brother was 
 born here. We both speak Welsh, but   
 our parents do not.                   
          We are moving from Moelfre   
 because my dad is getting a better job
 with his insurance company. I was     
 going to go to Amlwch Comprehensive   
 school, but now I have to go to       
 another school in Wrexham. I am       
 looking forward to going although I   
 shall miss my friends.
