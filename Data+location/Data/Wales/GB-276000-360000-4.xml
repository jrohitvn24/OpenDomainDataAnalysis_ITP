 woodpecker, tree-creeper, jay, magpie,
 pigeon, goldcrest, spotted flycatcher,
 collared dove, a variety of tits and  
 finches live here. Most common        
 songbirds and jackdaws are found near

  {Reclamation}                        
  There are many disused lead mines in 
 the area. The spoil tips from one of  
 these near Lake Geirionydd has caused 
 seepage into the lake which is now    
 "dead". Under E.E.C. auspices         
 these tips are being reclaimed by the 
 use of special grass seed from Canada.
