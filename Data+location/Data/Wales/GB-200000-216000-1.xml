		<title>01PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF WISTON</title>
		<content>  The village of Wiston lies close to  
 the centre of the old Pembrokeshire,  
 approx.2 miles north of the A.40 and  
 approx. 5 miles N.E of Haverfordwest. 
  It is a very small village centered  
 around a Norman Castle and Church.    
 The area is given over almost entirely
 to beef and dairy farming.The land is 
 high in relation to the surronding    
 countryside and there are magnificant 
 views to the North and South.         
   The primary school,St.Aidans V.A.is 
 a new neighbourhood school and has    
 children from Maenclochog in the North
 to Robesten Wathen in the East.       
    The village being small in         
 population and some distance from the 
 main road,has no public transport     
 services.Although this village is a   
 pretty one and an attraction it has   
 very poor amenities and does not have 
 much trade except from the villagers. </content>
