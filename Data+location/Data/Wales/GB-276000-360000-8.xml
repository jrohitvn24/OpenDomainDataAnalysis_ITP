		<content> Cattle Market:                        
 Llanrwst has a well known cattle      
 market with frequent sales. There is  
 always a market on the Wednesday which
 succeeds the first Tuesday in the     
 month and this is known as Fair       
 Day.The markets are well attended by  
 farmers from both within the immediate
 area and others from further afield.On
 the Fair Day, or otherwise on Tuesdays
 weekly,a market is held in Ancaster   
 Square,consisting of about 12         
 stalls,sometimes more in the summer or
 before Christmas. These offer carpets,
 household linen, china, clothing,     
 leather goods, plants and garden      
 produce, soft furnishing,             
 haberdashery, fruit and vegetables,   
 and seasonal items. The market is well
 attended and buses bring in customers 
 from outlying areas.
