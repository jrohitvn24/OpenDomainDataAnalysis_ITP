		<title>07Maes-y-groes Farm,Cilcain(1)</title>
		<content> Agriculture in this area is generally 
 based on beef/dairy cattle and sheep. 
 Maes-y-groes Farm (G.R.185648) totals 
 80ha: 48ha at the farm and a separated
 block of 32ha of poorer grazing at Cwm
 Llydan,to the southwest, on the lower 
 slopes of the Clwydian Hills. Most of 
 the land is pasture, grazed by beef-  
 cattle and sheep, but 16ha is used to 
 produce hay or silage and 12ha to grow
 barley, all used as winter livestock  
 fodder.Both artificial fertilizers and
 farmyard manure are used to keep the  
 soil in good condition.The usual range
 of farm machinery includes a combine- 
 harvester for cutting the barley.     
 Specialization in just two enterprises
 (beef and sheep) means that normally  
 the farm is run by only one man:casual
 labour is employed when necessary, and
 silage production is carried out by   
 contract.                             </content>
