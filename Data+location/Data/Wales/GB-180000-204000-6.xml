		<content> Our area includes part of the entrance
 to the busy oil-port of Milford Haven.
 Last year over 3000 dockings were made
 at the port.These ships all pass      
 through our area,using the North or   
 South Channel approaches.There are    
 important buoys along their route,    
 marking the channel and a submerged   
 wreck.There is also a 200' high light 
 tower which acts as a transit mark for
 the channel.Ships also use the        
 services of tugs and/or a pilot.All   
 sorts of ships and boats pass through 
 our area including large tankers      
 carrying crude oil from the Middle    
 East and Africa,smaller tankers       
 carrying other refinery products on   
 local voyages,cargo boats carrying    
 timber and scrap iron,fishing         
 boats,and the Irish ferry.Some of thee
 anchor in Dale Roads or Dale Bay while
 waiting for instructions or the tide. </content>
