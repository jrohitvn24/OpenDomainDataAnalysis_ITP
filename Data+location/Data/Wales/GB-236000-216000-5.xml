		<content> One of the leveliest views is over the
 wall near Green Castle.  You look up  
 the River Towy and see the twists and 
 curves up to Carmarthen Town. You see 
 the newer area of development on the  
 hills which act as a backdrop to the  
 town.  The higher land in the         
 foreground is crowned by a large farm,
 with its out-houses white-washed and  
 looking clean.  Across the river we   
 can see the main London to Fishguard  
 railway line.  Another point of       
 vantage is the top of Alltyenap Hill  
 Here if you look to the west you can  
 see the village of Llanllwch with its 
 church immediately below you and the  
 land stretching out in front like a   
 map with the new extension of M4 going
 off in the distance.  If you look     
 north you again get a view of         
 Carmarthen with its hills behind it.
