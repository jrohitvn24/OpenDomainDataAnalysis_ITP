		<title>02The New Estate,Llanddulas</title>
		<content> The new estate was started            
 about fifteen years ago,and isn't     
 completed yet.The last house built on 
 the estate was on Craig-y-Don,and the 
 first road to be built was Bron       
 Wern.Our house is at the end of Lon   
 Pendyffryn.There's some waste land    
 nearby on which I play.There are some 
 dormer bungalows on the new estate    
 too.                                  
     Llanddulas Village Estate lies    
 between the cliff-top chalets and the 
 old village.The streets are steep,as  
 their Welsh names show,e.g.Tan-y-Graig
 meaning "under the rock",and Pen      
 dyffryn,which is "valley top".However 
 there is a lovely view over the sea   
 towards Colwyn Bay,and Rhyl.          
   The estate was built so that people 
 from Liverpool and Manchester etc.    
 could come and live in Llanddulas,and 
 get jobs in this area.                </content>
