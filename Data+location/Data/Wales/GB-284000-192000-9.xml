		<content> There are six{places of worship}in    
{Nantyffyllon.}One{church,}four{chapels
 and one{Kingdom hall.}Of the four     
 chapels, Salem is{Welsh Baptist,      
 Siloh and Saron are Welsh             
{congregragational}and Trinty is       
{presbyterian.}St. Peters church shares
 a vicar with the church at Caerau     
 Siloh shares a minister with a chapel 
 in Caerau while the other chapels rely
 on visiting ministers. Services       
 average two each Sunday with          
 St.Peters, Salem and Trinty also      
 having Sunday schools. The chapels are
 all very large buildings which were   
 constructed during the later part of  
 the 19th century. All are in a good   
 state of repair but are very expensive
 to maintain. A 98 year old tenor bell 
 summons parishioners to services at   
 St.Peters. St.Peters also has some    
 beautiful stained glass windows.      </content>
