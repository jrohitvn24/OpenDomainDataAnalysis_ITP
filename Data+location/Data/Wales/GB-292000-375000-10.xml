		<title>10THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER</title>
		<content> The weekly "Abergele Visitor" is one  
 of 9 newspapers published on the coast
 by the N.Wales Weekly News newspaper  
 group on its computerised             
 photo-setting machines at Llandudno   
 Junction.  It was established         
 independently in the early 1860's and 
 is so named because originally its    
 principle news comprised lists of     
 holidaymakers staying in Abergele and 
 Pensarn.  It retails at 12p and has a 
 weekly circulation of 6,500 copies    
 covering Rhyl to Llanddulas.  It is   
 staffed by an editor (Tony Moores) an 
 assistant editor, 2 reporters and a   
 free-lance photographer.  Production  
 day is Thursday, for sale on Friday.  
 Stories this week concern disquiet    
 over aspects of the building          
 developments up Llanfair Road; the    
 raising of Â£1/4 million for the local 
 general hospital's body-scanner fund. </content>
