		<content> Ogmore Vale and Wyndham are           
 communities which grew up around the  
 coal industry. The last working       
 colliery in the valley, the Wyndham   
 Western, closed a couple of years ago.
 The last link with coal mining is the 
 washeries in Ogmore Vale which employs
 about 140 men and to which coal is    
 brought from the Garw Valley. Its     
 future is not garenteed.              
 The Penllwyngwent Industrial Estate is
 an attempt at attracting much needed  
 light industry in the area and at     
 present afford employment.            
 In a class of 30 Pupils, 8 said that  
 their fathers worked in a coal mine or
 washery, 15 said that their mothers   
 worked. When asked what would the     
 pupils like to do when they left      
 school none mentioned working in the  
 coal industry.
