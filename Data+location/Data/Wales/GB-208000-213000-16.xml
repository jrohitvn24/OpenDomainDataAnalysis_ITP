 NARBERTH BUT, YOU NEED A HOUSE TO     
 LIVE IN- HOUSES COME IN MANY SHAPES   
 AND SIZES.BUNGLOW, DETACHED, COUNCIL  
 HOUSE, SEMI DETACHED OR COTTAGE AND IF
 PEOPLE ARE ON HOLIDAY THEY CAN STAY IN
 A CARAVAN.MOST OF THE FLATS IN        
 NARBERTH ARE ABOVE THE SHOPS IN HIGH  
 STREET.NARBERTH CASTLE HAS BEEN LIVED 
 IN LIKE A HOUSE, NOW THERE ARE ONLY   
 REWINS. BLACK ALDERN IS A BEAUTIFUL   
 OLD HOUSE. BLOOMFIELD IS A COMMUNITY  
 CENTRE THAT ALSO USED TO BE A MANSION.
 ALONG TIME AGO THEY USED MORTAR TO    
 BUILD THINGS LIKE CASTLES. NOW WE HAVE
 LOVELY MODERN HOUSES WITH CHIPPINGS,  
 OR SOME PAINTED ON THE OUTSIDE SOME   
 PEOPLE HAVE GARAGES ATTACHED TO THEIR 
 HOMES MOST HOUSES ARE IN STREETS IN   
 THE TOWNS AND HAVE GOT A NUMBER OR A  
 NAME ON THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.
