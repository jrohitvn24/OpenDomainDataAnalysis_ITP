		<title>18Language spoken in Glanaman.</title>
		<content>    Glanaman is a traditionally Welsh  
 area; Welsh has been the language     
 spoken on the streets and in the homes
 for many generations.                 
    However, increasingly, the younger 
 people are tending to make English the
 medium for their everyday             
 conversations. There has been an      
 influx of English speaking families   
 into the area and despite the school's
 bilingual approach to education,      
 children tend to speak English when   
 one of their number is unable to speak
 Welsh.                                
    In addition, the television set is 
 a very powerful linguistic force in   
 modern life and although there are    
 Welsh programmes available, the vast  
 majority of programmes watched by the 
 local community are in English.
