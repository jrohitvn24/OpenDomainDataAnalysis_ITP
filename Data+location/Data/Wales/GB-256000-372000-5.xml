		<title>05The Arts in Bangor</title>
		<content>    Bangor is not a great centre for   
 the Arts but it has some activities.  
 The focal point of these activities is
{Theatre Gwynedd}which seats 300 and is
 owned by the{University}but used by   
 many outside bodies such as{Cwymni    
{Theatr Cymru}and the{Bangor Festival  
{Players}.The theatre was built in the 
 early 1970's.Welsh as well as English 
 plays are performed there and this    
 summer the{Bangor Festival Players}are
 putting on 'Godspell'.                
    There is a small art gallery and   
 museum in Bangor.At present an        
 exhibition of North Wales Landscapes  
 by F.W.Heyes is being shown there     
 while a week or two ago pictures by   
 children of local schools were on show
    The{Plaza cinema}is the only one in
 Bangor.It has recently been remodelled
 to include two cinemas and one bingo  
 hall.                                 </content>
