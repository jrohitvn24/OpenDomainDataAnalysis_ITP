		<title>05LIFE in RHAYADER</title>
		<content> Rhayader is a small market town with  
 better than usual facilities for      
 outdoor activities e.g.angling,rugby, 
 football,bowling,cricket,tennis,pony  
 trekking and walking.Facilities for   
 indoor pursuits are limited.          
  The retired members of the area enjoy
 a friendly atmosphere with good social
 and medical services.They also have   
 several organisations to join.        
  There are few job opportunities and  
 young people usually need to travel   
 for work.Facilities are limited and   
 wages generally low.The percentage of 
 married women in full time employment 
 is low compared with more urban areas.
  Young people belonging to the farming
 fraternity tend to be quite happy but 
 others would like more amenities.     
  Food prices are usually 10-15% above 
 urban prices,due to high transport    
 costs and the low density population. </content>
