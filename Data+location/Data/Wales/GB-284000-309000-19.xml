		<content> No local doctor. Surgury is held in   
 Village Hall every Monday 3pm served  
 by 2 doctors from Glantwymyn clinic 4\
 miles distant. About 3 patients attend
 each week &amp; prescriptions are deliverd
 to the shop the following day. There  
 are 2 district nurses &amp; 1 home help   
 servicing this area. A domiciliary    
 chiropodist is available on request.  
 Several villagers incapacitated &amp;     
 housebound. Some have retired here due
 to ill health. The main illness is    
 Farmer's lung. Main cause of death is 
 heart disease followed by cancer. Farm
 accidents are treated at Aberystwyth. 
 Local spring water is often used for  
 drinking in preference to chlorinated 
 mains water. Some older Welsh         
 villagers consider the villagers use  
 too much water for washing. Some farms
 have their own water supply which can 
 run dry in dry weather.               </content>
