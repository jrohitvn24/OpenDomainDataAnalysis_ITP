		<content>  The inhabitants of our village object
 to the English translation of Heol-y- 
 Cyw so efforts are being made to trace
 the origin of the name.               
  The village developed due to coal    
 mining during the last 90 years. Early
 19th. century Ordinance survey records
 do not mention the village.           
  Some authorities suggest that{Cyw}is 
 a corruption of either{Ciwc or Cue}   
 though there is no written evidence to
 support this.                         
  However, records of the early 17th.  
 century refer to land south of the    
 present village,as{Gwaun-y-Kiw - the  
{Meadow of the Kiw.}It seems likely    
 that this land was a grazing area for 
 young horses rather than young        
 chickens. (See glossary.)             
  One day, maybe, our village will be  
 known as{Heol-y-Cyw (Colt's Way.)     
 (Group A.) L.A.                       </content>
