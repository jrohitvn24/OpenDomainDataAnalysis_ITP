		<content> As our block is in a very rural area  
 there is an abundance of wildlife.From
 our classroom we see rabbits playing  
 and grey squirrels in the trees which 
 form our boundary.There are many foxes
 and we have seen large badger setts in
 a wood near school.While on a walk in 
 a disused quarry we saw a very large  
 hare.Stouts and weasels are frquently 
 seen.Unfortunatly even in our quiet   
 area hedgehogs are frequently killed  
 by vehicles.Molehills can be seen in  
 the fields and gardens of the area.   
 During the summer months lizards,     
 grass snakes and slow worms can be    
 seen.20 years ago an adder made its   
 way into our school.Frog spawn and    
 toad spawn is to be found in our      
 numerous small ponds and ditches.     
 Our area is home to a great number of 
 field mice rats and voles the school  
 cat once brought home a wild mink.    </content>
