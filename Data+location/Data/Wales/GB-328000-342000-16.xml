		<content> Different but not better is the       
 opinion of people who have spent most 
 of their lives in the area. Gone are  
 all but one of the eight brickworks   
 which now makes tiles.The station     
 which employed over 80 people is an   
 unmanned open station.Shops are more  
 numerous but shops eg. WH Smith are   
 gone.People are less friendly and have
 less to do with each other.The        
 maternity hospital has closed as has  
 the Ruabon Parish Hall,once a thriving
 cinema and theatre.The dual           
 carriageway in the middle of Ruabon   
 was built in the 1930's.The church    
 corner was improved in the 1960's and 
 a garden of rest made for the graves. 
 A few of the chapels have closed.Small
 industrial estates have been built,   
 new houses at Vicarage Fields after   
 1946 and Pont Adam after 1966.The     
 medical centre dates from 1984.       </content>
