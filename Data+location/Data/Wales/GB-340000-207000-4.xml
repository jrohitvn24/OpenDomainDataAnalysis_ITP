 is an historically listed building and

 church are the remains of the effigies
 of the Earls of Worcester broken in   
 Cromwells time.There is a stained     
 glass window in memory of the 1st Lord
 Raglan of the Crimea.The Union Jack is
 flown on Commonwealth Days and the    
 Queens birthday.The Church of Wales   
 flag is flown on main festival days   
 and Saints Days. The church bell is   
 rung by the verger. There is also a   
 set of electronic bells used for      
 weddings.On three sides of the tower  
 there is a clock face given by Mrs.   
 Bosanquet.She had quarrelled with the 
 Station master so the side facing the 
 station road has no clock face.       </content>
