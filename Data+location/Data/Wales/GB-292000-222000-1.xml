 The river known as the Afon Senni     
 flows northwards across the western   
 part of the block,to flow eventually  
 into the R.Usk at Sennybridge,4 km    
 to the north west.                    
 This part of the Senni valley lies at 
 a height of 240-280 metres above sea  
 level.  The valley is steep-sided to  
 the west but the northern and central 
 parts of the block is undulating land 
 rising to about 330 metres.           
 The highest land is in the south east 
 where the peak of FAN FRYNYCH rises to
 629 metres. The steep north west face 
 of this hill,which is one of the      
 lesser summits of the Brecon Beacons, 
 dominates the landscape.              
 The area is sparsely populated and    
 the settlement everywhere comprises   
 small isolated farms.                 </content>
