		<title>13TRANSPORT IN COSHESTON AREA</title>
		<content> Public transport in the country area  
 round Pembroke is not very frequent.  
 Only one bus a day, the school bus    
 taking children to and from school,   
 visits Cosheston. Nearly everyone in  
 the area has a car, without one shop_ 
 ping etc would be very difficult. Of  
 the 17 children we interviewed at     
 Cosheston school, all their parents   
 had cars and 6 of them had 2 cars.    
   There are regular bus services in   
 Pembroke Dock, most routes having an  
 hourly service. Fewer people in the   
 town have cars.                       
   There is a lot of small boat sailing
 on the River Cleddau but no commercial
 river transport in our area apart from
 a pleasure boat which takes trips up  
 the river from Pembroke Dock.         
   There are no railway stations in our
 area, though the line passes through a
 tunnel in one corner of the block.    </content>
