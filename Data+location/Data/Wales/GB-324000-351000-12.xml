		<content>   The area surrounding Bwlchgwyn is at
 an altitude of between 1150 and 1200ft
 This then determine the type of       
 agriculture carried out in the        
 locality.                             
   Most farms are smallholdings and are
 not generally large enough to provide 
 families with their main source of    
 income. Many are now owned by people  
 who farm for fun.                     
   No crops are grown (except for trees
 by the Forestry Commision). Animals   
 are kept. Cows provide butter and milk
 Welsh mountain sheep are mainly bred  
 to be sold as lambs, and chicken and  
 hens are bred for eggs or for sale.   
 Some more unuaual breeds of animal are
 seen in the area. These include Jacob 
 Sheep and Anglo-Nubian goats. The land
 is generally fenced rough grazing,    
 with the moorland of the Llandegla    
 Moors nearby.                         </content>
