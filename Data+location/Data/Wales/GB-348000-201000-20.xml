		<title>20Changes in Catbrook</title>
		<content> There have been a number of changes in
 lifestyles in recent years.  There is 
 only one shop in the village now,     
 whereas there used to be 3 shops - l  
 butcher,l grocer and l sweets and Post
 Office.  The shop in Whhitelye is no  
 longer there.  Housing has changed too
 - the Chapel House in Catbrook and the
 Chapel at Parkhouse used to be        
 chapels, but have been converted into 
 private homes.  "Bovis Homes" have    
 built on what was farming land.       
 People need private transport as there
 are no longer 3 buses, but only one   
 market bus on a Friday to Monmouth.   
 The Youth Club has closed and the     
 churches and chapels which used to    
 have a full congregation are now      
 usually attended by only a few        
 people.The school is smaller now and  
 will close in l987 when children will 
 attend the new school in Trellech.    </content>
