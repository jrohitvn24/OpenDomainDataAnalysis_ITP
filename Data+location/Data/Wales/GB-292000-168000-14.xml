		<title>14St.Donats Castle</title>
		<content>  In 1925 the castle and grounds were  
 bought by Mr.Randolph Hearst,the      
 American millionaire newspaper owner. 
 Mr.Hearst entertained many of his film
 star friends at the castle,and many   
 local people can still remember the   
 huge limousines and the famous faces  
 seen in Llantwit Major during this    
 time.                                 
 In 1960 the castle and grounds were   
 bought to house a school,and in 1962  
 the school was opened.That school was 
 Atlantic College and it is still the  
 function of the castle today.
