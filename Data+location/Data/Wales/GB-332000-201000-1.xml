		<title>01LITTLE MILL DISTRICT</title>
		<content> Little Mill and the surrounding area  
 is mainly rural with mixed farming    
 concerns_from dairy to crops.Deciduous
 trees and coniferous woods cover the  
 hillsides.                            
 Three villages,Little Mill,Glascoed   
 and Monkswood are the main residential
 areas,all with thriving communities.  
 Houses and farms are scattered between
 these villages.                       
 Some farmland is owned by the Ministry
 of Defence as there is a defence      
 establishment which provides much     
 needed employment other than farming. 
 The valley, running west to east      
 conducts the main road to Usk town and
 this joins the valley through which   
 the famous salmon fishing River Usk   
 flows southwards.                     
 Various members of the local Womens   
 Institute have given information about
 the area.                             </content>
