		<title>11CANOEING AT PONTSTICILL</title>
		<content>  Dolygaer Outdoor Pursuits Centre also
 offers the sport of canoeing on       
 Ponsticill Reservoir.While I was in   
 Dolygaer I had the chance to go       
 canoeing on the reservoir.I was glad  
 that I went canoeing on the reservoir 
 because some of my friends went       
 canoeing on the canal and they said   
 that it was very muddy.When we got    
 down to the equipment store we were   
 given life jackets,we were then given 
 a canoe each.Then our instructor      
 showed us how to use the paddle corr_ 
 ectly.Once we could all paddle he     
 showed us how to make a raft.Once we  
 had done that we had to go on the back
 of somebody elses canoe.I was         
 wondering how it would come in useful 
 when you are canoeing,and he said that
 if you capsize out at sea and your    
 boat is full of water then you will   
 not have to wait to be rescued.       </content>
