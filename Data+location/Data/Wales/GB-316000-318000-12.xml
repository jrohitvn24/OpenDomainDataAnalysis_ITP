		<title>12ECOLOGY-BRYNGWYN POOL</title>
		<content> Bryngwyn pool is in C2 kilometre      
 square.It is the biggest pool in the  
 grid.It measures 350 metres long and  
 70 metres wide approximately.The pool 
 is in the grounds of Bryngwyn Hall    
 which has been empty since the Second 
 World War.In it's lonely setting a    
 heronry has been established there for
 many years.The herons use the pool for
 nesting and roosting.The herons go    
 fishing in the Rivers Cain,Vyrnwy and 
 Banwy. They have five blue eggs which 
 hatch in about three and a half       
 weeks.They use the same nest nearly   
 every time.Some of the trees          
 surrounding the pool are dying        
 possibly due to the build up of       
 droppings.
