		<content> Every Sunday was a special day - no   
 work - the chapels were full.         
 Monday was always washing day....home

 Sunday's boots till next week!        
 Everyone gathered together to do the  
 hay-making,sheep                      
 dipping,threshing.Everyone went to    
 Pwnc and we had to know our Bible to  
 answer.The Singing Festival was held  
 in different places each year and we  
 would miss school for that.           
 There was a Squire's tea-party and    
 sports at Llwyngwair Manor,we also had
 one such party in the sand-dunes at   
 Traeth Mawr.
