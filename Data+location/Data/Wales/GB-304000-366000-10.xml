 two seperate sites{3/4ml.}apart.During
 the winter the children were at the{  
{mercy }of the{weather}and the{traffic 
 was also a{danger.}There have been    
 many problems during the building     
 programme.{Broken electricity mains   
{which cause faulty heating and closure
{of the school for two days.}There were
 also problems of{noise,mud,dust and   
{restrictions of movement.}Access to   
 parking space will not change because 
 staff use space next to the gym and   
 swimming pool which is hardly used    
 during the day.The old grammer school 
 which used to be part of the split    
 site is now a{centre for the          
{Y.T.S.,a dancing school and day       
{classes for adults.}
