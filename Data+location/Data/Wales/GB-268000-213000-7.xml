		<content> In our area there is mostly sheep     
 farming.  This is because the {main   
{land cover is grassland.} The farms   
 are not very large mainly             
 smallholdings and they all farm sheep 
 and cattle.  We have four livestock   
 farms in our area.  One of the largest
 is{Pantyffynon Farm}and they have 31  
 cows and 545 sheep.  Pantyffynon farm 
 covers 61 hectares.                   
 We found that most farmers had lived  
 on the local farms for most of their  
 lives.  The majority of local farmers 
 make use of the rough grazing on the {
{Black Mountain}which covers a large   
 area of our block.                    
 One disadvantage of farming livestock 
 in our block is the distance livestock
 has to be transported to market-the   
 nearest livestock market being some 20
 miles outside the block.
