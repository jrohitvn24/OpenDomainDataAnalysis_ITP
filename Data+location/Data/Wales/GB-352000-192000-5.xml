		<title>05Transport. Town Arch Closure</title>
		<content> The town arch was built in the 1200's.
 In 1985 a crack in the pedestrian arch
 in the springing stone was spotted by 
 a member of Monmouth district council.
 This crack was probably caused by     
 large vehicles colliding with the arch
 but it can be repaired.To make it safe
 again{it will cost about Â£80,000}to   
 repair the lower part, and{for the top
{about Â£18,000.}The money to pay for   
 this will come from two nurses.At     
 least half will come from government  
 grants.The rest,hopefully,will come   
 from chepstow rate payers and from    
 appeals.The lower part will be        
 finished in about 3\ months time.     
 The whole thing should be finished    
 in about 5-6 months.The idea is to    
 pump glue into the wall which will    
 hold together,because the inside is   
 damaged,the outside stone may crack   
 and fall,and the arch disintergrate.  </content>
