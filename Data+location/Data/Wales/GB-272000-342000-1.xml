		<title>01The Hills East of Ffestiniog</title>
		<content> This is an area of low hills and      
 mountains.  Manod Mawr is the highest 
 at 216 feet (661 metres) a region of  
 bare rock and steep slopes.  Three SE 
 flowing streams, connected to a lake  
 and reservoir, drain the area.        
                                       
 This is a landscape of rough          
 grassland, heather and bare rock      
 interspersed with areas of poorly     
 drained land.  Old mine workings and  
 quarries abound though today there is 
 only one active roadstone quarry.     
                                       
 Few people live and work here.  One   
 farm, a former farmhouse, used as a   
 holiday home and water treatment      
 plant are the only buildings of any   
 size.  Sheep are the dominant         
 livestock.
