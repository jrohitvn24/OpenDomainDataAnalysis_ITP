		<content> This is an area well known for its    
{agriculture.}It should come as no     
 suprise to learn that the majority of 
 houses in the area are{farm houses.   
     The two villages of Rhyd Y Meudwy 
 and Pentrecelyn are small hamlets     
 which follow the roads running through
 them.There are{no council houses}at   
 Pentrecelyn and only four at Rhyd Y   
 Meudwy.                               
     The majority of houses at         
 Pentrecelyn are{not very old.}In      
 fact, most were built this century.   
     The farm houses, on the other     
 hand,are far older.  The majority     
{having thick stone walls.}The         
 traditional families of the district  
 still live on the farms.              
     A number of the farm houses are   
 being{modernised}at present.
