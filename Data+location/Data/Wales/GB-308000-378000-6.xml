		<content> Pant Glas Farm in Axton has recently  
 changed hands, and is now a Riding    
 School.                               
 The new owners have built well        
 ventilated stables for ten horses and 
 ponies A barn has been converted into 
 a self contained flat, and people are 
 now able to book for a weeks riding   
 instruction.  Emphasis is placed upon 
 the correct schooling of the horses.  
 A large are has been levelled off for 
 Dressage use.  The surface has        
 been covered with stone chippings,    
 plastic sheeting, and finally wood    
 chipping to make an ideal space for   
 disciplining both horse and the rider.
  Provision is also made for the horses
 to roam freely in the fields disturbed
 only by a large nest of rabbits.  All 
 the insruction is given under the     
 guidance of experienced Riding School 
 Instructors.                          </content>
