		<title>08HOW I USE THE AREA</title>
		<content> NICOLA LESLEY EVANS aged 11           
 I get up at about 7.30 a.m. mosdt     
 mornings. I have one brother, Carl. I 
 also have six dogs. I often go to the 
 Crymlyn Bog and the area around the   
 old Tir John power station to play or 
 exercise the dogs. Thirty years ago,  
 when my mother was just a baby, my    
 gran and most of the people of Port   
 Tennant complained to the Council     
 about the unhealthy atmosphere they   
 were living in. They could not put    
 their washing on the line when there  
 wasn't an easterly wind blowing _ they
 would look as if they had been        
 sprinkled with soot. Today the Carbon 
 Black Co. and the power station have  
 both gone, but there is still a bit of
 pollution where they used to be.      
 People still tip their rubbish here.  
 Children and animals could cut        
 themselves and rats are found.        </content>
