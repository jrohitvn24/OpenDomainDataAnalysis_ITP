		<title>04      FREEHOLDLAND</title>
		<content>   Around our school and covering rough
 -ly half a square mile is the land    
 called{Freeholdland.}The land is main-
 ly grass but it is covered with many  
 types of wildlife.{Trees}include{Oak, 
{Ash, Maple, Beech and Horse-Chestnut  
 while the many types of{wild flowers  
 include{speedwell}and{orchids.}Here   
 are also lots of{insects;}the most    
 common we found were{froghoppers}and  
{ladybirds.}At the nothern end of Free-
 holdland is a wood called{Snatchwood. 
   Also contained in the area are{two  
{quarries; the smaller one contains our
{school (Pontnewynydd).}The larger one 
 is just above it and is 4 or 5 times  
 larger. Here{limestone}was quarried   
 but this stopped in the 1960's.       
   Much of the original land has had a 
 housing estate caled{Trevethin}built  
 on it. There are also{6 detatched     
{houses}and a{small farm.              </content>
