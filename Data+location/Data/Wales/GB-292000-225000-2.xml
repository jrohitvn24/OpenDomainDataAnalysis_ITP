		<content> CARNIVAL DAYS                         
  Carnival days are happy,             
  Carnival days maybe sad,             
  Carnival days are funny              
  And they make me feel glad.          
                                       
  On carnival days you have fun in the 
 sun,                                  
  And sweets as well as treats.        
  And buy things that are fit for      
 kings,                                
  Like false diamond rings and things. 
                                       
  We all go in the races,              
  And the winners have smiles on their 
 faces.                                
  You can buy cuddly dogs,             
  And small paper frogs.               
  And in the sun you can play.         
 So it really is a nice day.
