		<title>08Clothes we wear.</title>
		<content>  There is no particular style in      
 fashion today. Anything goes. Girls   
 have many pretty things to choose     
 from.                                 
  Most girls like skirts and blouses.  
 The skirt is usually about knee length
 and can be flared or straight. Blue is
 a very popular colour at the moment.  
 Some girls like to wear trousers which
 can be skin-tight or baggy. Baggy     
 trousers are considered most          
 fashionable. When visiting discos     
 girls wear brightly coloured clothes  
 and garish make-up.                   
  Boys,too, are very fashion concious  
 and like to wear blue jeans and       
 T-shirts, the jeans being as tight as 
 possible. Some,however, are beginning 
 to wear baggy trousers.               
  Clothes are plentiful,but are rather 
 expensive. (Group A.)S.J.
