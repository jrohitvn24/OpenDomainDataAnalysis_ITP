 Method of treatment.  -  The water    
 before treatment is referred to as    
 "raw water" and 14 to 28 parts per    
 million of aluminium sulphate are     
 added to this raw water.  This forms a
 "floc" of aluminium hydroxide which   
 collects the colouring matter in the  
 water and allows it to be removed by  
 the filtyers.  After filtration sodium
 carbonate is added at a dosage of     
 about 14-28 parts per million to      
 increase the pH value of the water    
 i.e. to make it more alkaline and     
 prevent it dissolving lead.  A        
 chlorinator using chlorine gas gives a
 dose of approx. 0.5 parts per million 
 to kill those bacteria not removed by 
 filtration.  A new chlorinator with an
 automatic residual controller is now  
 being installed.
