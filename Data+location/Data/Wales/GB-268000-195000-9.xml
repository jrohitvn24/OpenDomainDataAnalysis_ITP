		<title>09THE B.P. OIL REFINERY</title>
		<content> B.P. Llandarcy was established as     
 Britain's first oil refinery in 1921. 
 It was expanded in 1960 and had a     
 maximum crude oil throughput of 8     
 million tonnes per year.Up to 3500    
 have been employed,falling to 1500 in 
 1980.Products include Kerosene,petrol,
 waxes,gases and numerous oils.The     
 crude is imported at Angle Bay,and    
 pumped 62 miles by pipeline to        
 Llandarcy.Most crude comes from the   
 middle east.My father is controller of
 blending and supplying of all export  
 oils.He calculates blends for quality 
 control.In 1985, competition from     
 other more modern refineries has      
 forced B.P. to reduce capacity.Crude  
 refining will stop,with specialization
 in other products e.g. kerosene.      
 Unfortunately numbers employed will   
 fall to 350.A sad decline for our     
 first refinery.      {Robert Seacombe}</content>
