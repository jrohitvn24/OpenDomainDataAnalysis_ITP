		<content> The supply of Natural Gas for the     
 whole of North Wales travels through  
 an underground pressure reducing      
 system on the site. It arrives from   
 the North Sea fields through a high   
 pressure pipeline.  It is distributed 
 through the gas pipe system built when
 town gas was produced here.  It is a  
 base for servicing and repairs to the 
 pipeline system and an office to deal 
 with customer queries. Accounts are   
 computerised, the mainframe being at  
 Cardiff with keyboards and monitors at
 Wrexham. Service and repairs are      
 speedily dealt with as the vans are in
 radio contact with this office.       
   A growing service is the sale of    
 Petroleum Liquified Gas (P.L.G.) which
 is stored there. The engineers have   
 their own helicopter, based locally,  
 for surveying the pipeline routes.
