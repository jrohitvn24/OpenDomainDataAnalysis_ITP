		<title>18Margam Park The Fallow Deer</title>
		<content> Margam Park has a fine herd of approx-
 imately 400 Fallow deer that are prob-
 ably descendants of a small herd      
 introduced in the C16th.  Present are 
 common and black Fallow and a small   
 number of white deer.  Each winter    
 about one hundred are culled to main- 
 tain the herd at the present figure   
 and avoid overgrazing.  Recently red  
 deer have been reintroduced after a   
 century's absence.  Deer from the     
 estate have escaped into Margam Forest
 where they are widely distributed.    
 Poaching is an habitual problem.      
 In October 1985, a red deer stag      
 supposed to have escaped from Margam  
 Park caused a pile up on the M4 motor-
 way.  The stag was in collision with a
 Ford Escort car, a bus and Rolls Royce
 before it was killed.  All three      
 vehicles were damaged in the crash.
