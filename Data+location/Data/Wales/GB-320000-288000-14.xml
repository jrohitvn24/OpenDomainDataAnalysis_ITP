		<title>14Sarn Motorsports Club</title>
		<content> In 1968 a few lads got together with  
 the idea of forming a Motorsports     
 club.They started raising money by    
 having dances and when they had enough
 money to find the prize money, a      
 meeting was called, and soon Sarn     
 Motorsports Club was born.This was in 
 1969.By now they had Â£150 in the bank 
 before they ran their first event,a   
{grass-track.}The meeting was held at{ 
{Mellington Hall}on ground owned by Mr 
 Jack Evans.It was run on a Saturday   
 afternoon.This was a big success.After
 that,they ran one more in May and one 
 in September.After a few years they   
 soon added a{scramble}to their list of
 events held at{Pant Farm,}Sarn.Then on
 to trails after that ,both with great 
 success.This went on for many years,  
 until one Sunday an accident between  
 two sidecars caused the death of one  
 member of Sarn Motorsports Club.      </content>
