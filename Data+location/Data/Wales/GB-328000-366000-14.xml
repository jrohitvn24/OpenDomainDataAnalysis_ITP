		<content> There is a range of housing- from 19th
 Century properties to modern homes,   
 but most houses are under 30 years    
 old.Families like their homes and are 
 mostly satisfied with them. From an   
 older house-"We are next to a railway 
 line and as trains pass they make the 
 house quiver." "Near us is a Youth    
 training workshop where they work with
 metal." From a modern house-"7 people 
 live in my house.It has 4 bedrooms 2  
 lounges a playroom 2 bathrooms 3      
 telephones &amp; a large garden.There is  
 an ornamental pool in the garden.
