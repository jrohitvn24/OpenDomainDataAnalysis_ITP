		<content>    Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari is a bilingual
 comprehensive school, one of three    
 situated in the county of Mid         
 Glamorgan. In our school subjects are 
 taught and examinations are written   
 through the medium of Welsh with the  
 exception of some science subjects.   
 All of the school's day to day        
 activities are run through the medium 
 of Welsh e.g physical education and   
 clubs held at dinner times.Pupils must
 be fluent in Welsh if they wish to    
 attend this school,the same applies   
 for the members of staff.             
    Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari was opened in 
 September 1974,and the catchment area 
 has changed twice since.The present   
 catchment area extends well beyond the
 area surveyed,including centres such  
 as Bridgend,Maesteg,Tonyrefail,       
 Llantrisant, Church Village,Tonteg,   
 Creigiau and Pentyrch.                </content>
