		<title>04SHOPPING IN RHYL PRECINCT</title>
		<content>  The majority of shoppers interviewed 
 were pleased with the precinct and    
 only 8% disliked it. Most liked the   
 convenience of shopping under one roof
 and praised the warmth, cleanliness   
 and easy parking.                     
  50% shopped more in Rhyl since it had
 opened. 26% who used to shop in       
 Chester and Prestatyn now shopped more
 regularly in Rhyl. 70% thought it was 
 too small and many felt it needed a   
 cafe, toilets, supermarket or large   
 store. Others wanted more plants,     
 music, more floors and one person even
 wanted a baby-minding service. Most   
 people thought car parking charges    
 were very reasonable but one person   
 said they should be free.             
  Most were local people who welcomed  
 the precinct but worried about the    
 large number of vacant shops in nearby
 streets as traders moved into it.     </content>
