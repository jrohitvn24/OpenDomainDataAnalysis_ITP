		<content> This is a rural area containing one   
 inn (much modernised with frequent    
 discos and catering for caravan and   
 pony trekking holidaymakers. The      
 churches and chapels are not as well  
 attended. The principal almost the    
 sole industry is sheep farming. Since 
 the introduction of EEC grants the    
 land has become over exploited with a 
 subsequent increase in meat           
 overproduction and an corresponding   
 decrease in moorland wildlife habitat 
 (corlews are becomng more rare) as a  
 result of intensive farming sheep and 
 cattle disease seems to be increasing 
 while the time the farmer has to walk 
 around his land  becomes less. Also   
 local authorities seem less able to   
 help aspiring young farmers to gain a 
 foothold. Something is desperately    
 wrong!
