		<content> The busy times of the year are:       
     1){Lambing}_ This starts around   
{Christmas}and finishes in{March.}The  
 lambs are sold in May_July. Dipping is
 done by the farmer but shearing is    
 done by contractors who can shear 280 
 sheep a day.The wool is sold in{      
{Abergavenny. }                        
     2){Grain Harvesting}_ This occurs 
 in{August_september}and is highly     
 mechanised. The combines run from     
 09.30 to 20.30. The 200 acres yield   
 400 tons of grain. The straw is sold  
 locally by auction.                   
     3){Haymaking}_ This occurs in {   
{June}and 5,000 bales are made from 50 
 acres. Although machines can cut,     
 turn, bale and pick up, the hay still 
 has to be moved and stacked properly  
 by hand. There is a danger of         
 fire,collapse and rot.{Silage}is not  
 made because it could cause pollution.</content>
