 have a doctor's surgery,dentist and a 
 chemist.Magor Surgery is on           
 Brassknocker street just off the main 
 square,one of the doctors in the      
 surgery is called Mr Louis.           
  The surgery in Magor has toys for the
 little children to play with,and books
 for the mothers to read.Magor surgery 
 is quite small and sometimes crowded  
 with people from all around Magor.    
  If the doctor has given you a        
 prescription,there's Chemist where you
 collect your medicine or tablets is in
 the square.If your teeth need to be   
 checked,above the chemist there's     
 a dentist.The dentist has a big chair 
 and a spot light to see into your     
 mouth,he has an assistant who gets his
 tools ready for him.All in all the    
 people in Magor are very healthy.
