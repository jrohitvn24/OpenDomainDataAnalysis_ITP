		<content> Minera is heavily dependant on its    
  proximity to Wrexham (about 4 miles) 
 to supplement its own services.When   
 interviewed, a common view was that   
 other than basic groceries it was     
 necessary  to travel into Wrexham,on  
 average two or three times a          
 week.Since the railway was finally    
 closed in the mid 1970's the only     
 transport has been the buses of both  
 Crosville and a local firm George     
 Edwards.The railway was closed to     
 passengers in 1935.This means that    
 Minera is served by an average of two 
 buses into Wrexham per hour and there 
 two bus stops in the village.The main 
 village store is at the Post          
 office.Recently a number of community 
 social groups have been set up such as
  popmobility but it was evident that  
 the church was still quite a strong   
 focal point for the community,        </content>
