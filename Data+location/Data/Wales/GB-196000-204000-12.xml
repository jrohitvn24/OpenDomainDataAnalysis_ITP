   At the Burton County Council meeting
 they discussed how to improve the     
 village. It was reported that this    
 year there would not be enough money  
 to improve the safety of the road at  
 Bowlings Corner.                      
   There was a discussion about public 
 footpaths because there was an        
 obstruction from Ashdale to Dumple    
 Dale and it has been agreed that the  
 County Council be asked to remove it.
