		<title>09ELVERING ON THE RIVER WYE.</title>
		<content>   We went elvering from Bigsweir to   
 Brockweir.My dad uses very fine       
 netting in his elver net.My dad went  
 about seven times running this year.  
 He goes every year some times I go    
 too. The numbers of the elvers have   
 dropped this year.My dad caught twenty
 Kg in weight.My dad got eight pounds  
 for his catch.                        
     I took my fishing net along as    
 well and we caught a flat fish. We    
 stuck a stick in the ground and the   
 tide came higher than the stick. There
 were plenty of little water vole      
 holes. I saw a rabbit hole.When its   
 night time we take a torch. There were
 lots of other people there but I was  
 the only child there. The river Wye is
 very deep so I had to take great care.
    The elvers are just like tiny worms
 we like to fry ours with bacon when we
 get home. James Morrison.             </content>
