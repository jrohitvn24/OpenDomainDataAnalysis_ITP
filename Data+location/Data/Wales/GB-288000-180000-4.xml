		<title>04NOTABLE EVENTS IN BRIDGEND</title>
		<content>  A recent event in Bridgend is the    
 opening of the new{Tesco Superstore}on
 the site of the last cattle market.Its
 easy parking facilities attract more  
 shoppers from surrounding areas and   
 this has also improved the trade of   
 other non-food shops in the town.     
  A{new general hospital,}the Princess 
 of Wales,is to open shortly.It is     
 reported to have the most modern      
 facilities in Europe and is carpeted  
 throughout.It will provide many jobs  
 in the area.                          
  The{Flood Prevention Scheme}on the   
 River has been completed.Many people  
 are pleased that it has been built,   
 although many believe that it spoils  
 the character of the Town.            
  New multi-storey{Ogwr Borough Council
{Offices}are being built at Angel      
 Street, resulting in the removal of   
 the Evergreen Hall.                   </content>
