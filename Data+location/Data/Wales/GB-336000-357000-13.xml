		<title>13Community Involvement</title>
		<content> During the 1970's certain schools in  
 Clwyd were designated as community    
 schools.  Although Darland School was 
 not one of these links were developed 
 with the community which have proved  
 very valuable.                        
                                       
 Activities include charity work,      
 assistance with playgroups, daytime   
 and evening voluntary groups, and     
 evening adult classes.  The annual Fun
 Run is an important part of the       
 school's charity work.  Pupils        
 following Child Care courses are      
 encouraged to help local playgroups.  
                                       
 Voluntary groups use school facilities
 but there is no paid tutor.  The      
 groups are managed according to the   
 wishes of the members.
