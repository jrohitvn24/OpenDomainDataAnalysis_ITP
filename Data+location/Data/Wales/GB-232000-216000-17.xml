		<content> As our block is in the countryside    
 there are very many wild birds.       
 Most people have large kitchen gardens
 and lawns and these attract birds the 
 most common being sparrows, tits,     
 robins and wrens.                     
 Also some larger birds such as the    
 magpie,jackdaws and crows come to our 
 gardens.                              
 Two of our most common and poupular   
 song birds are the blackbird and the  
 thrush which are often seen feeding on
 slugs worms and snails.               
 We have many summer visitors such as  
 the house martain, swifts and swallow.
 The cuckoos also visits,however there 
 seemed to be fewer this year and they 
 were later than usual.                
 The most common birds of prey seen on 
 high ground in the area are buzzards  
 tawny and barn owls and a few eagles  
 in our block.                         </content>
