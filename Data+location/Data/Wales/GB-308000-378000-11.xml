		<title>11SOCIAL CONCERNS IN TRELAWNYD</title>
		<content> The Royal Society for Mentally        
 Handicapped and Adults (MENCAP) has a 
 small home for 8 trainees in          
 Trelawnyd.  The main home at Rhuddlan 
 arranges all the administrative work, 
 and the Senior Houseparents has       
 responsibility for the trainees who   
 are betweem l6 and 22 years of age.   
 he trainees are sent from all over    
 Britain and are paid for by the Local 
 Authorities until they are l8 years.  
 They then require sponsorship or      
 financing by their Social Services.   
 There is no set scheme of work but the
 aim is to offer work experience for   
 living.  They receive Â£7.15 per week  
 pocket money, and they have to learn  
 to take responsibility for purchasing 
 small everyday items for themselves.  
 The trainees have work experience in  
 running a small shop, assisting with  
 maintenance and local renovation work.</content>
