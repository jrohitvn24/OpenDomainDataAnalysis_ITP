		<content> The early prosperity of Trefriw       
 resulted from its popularity as a     
 hydropathic centre, until the second  
 world war,when the Conwy silted up,so 
 that the river steamers were no longer
 able to disembark passengers here.The 
 wells had been known since Roman times
 when the "caves" may have been        
 excavated in their searches for       
 lead.There are two springs, one very  
 rich in iron, the other in            
 sulphur.The waters have never been    
 known to fail even in severe drought- 
 a rare occurrence in this region of   
 heavy rainfall! After falling into    
 disuse the Pump house became derelict,
 but was restored some years ago, and  
 is now a private dwelling.            
 Steps near this building are carved   
 with symbols believed to be Early     
 Christian in origin.
