		<title>16Fishing in Dale</title>
		<content> Fishing is done mainly by amateurs,   
 some of whom are great experts, using 
 several different methods. There are  
 two large boats, registered form      
 Milford Haven, the Castle Bay of Dale 
 and the Garlandstone, which are used  
 for commercial fishing. Six smaller   
 ones are used mainly as fishing boats 
 with others used for occaional        
 fishing. The large boats fish for     
 lobsters and crabs by putting down    
 pots chiefly round the offshore       
 islands. Other pot are put down arount
 the coast in our area, by amateurs.   
 Nets are also put out in the sheltered
 bay of Dale, mainly for catching      
 herring and mullet. A popular method  
 of fishing is by rod and line from an 
 anchored boat. In the area dogfish,   
 pollack and mackrell can be caught in 
 this way; and from further afield,    
 skate, ray, turbot and tope are landed</content>
