 near the church.The car park in front 
 of the church was the playground.There
 was one big roomwith desks arranged in
 tiers.In 1910 a new council school was
 built with three rooms.Children       
 started school when they were five and
 stayed until they were fourteen.Bright
 children who passed the scholarship   
 exam went to the grammar school in    
 Pembroke Dock.Some children had to    
 walk 2 miles to school from Freshwater
 East,Trewent and Manorbier Newton.    
 There were no school meals before     
 1940.The children brought jam or bacon
 sandwiches and billy cans of cold tea 
 which were heated in front of the fire
 in time for luinch at twelve o'clock. 
 There were no indoor toilets and the  
 children had to walk 75 yards across  
 the playground if they needed to go to
 the toilet.                           </content>
