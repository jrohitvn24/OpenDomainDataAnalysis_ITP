		<title>05Working at Denbigh Hospital</title>
		<content>   We cannot over emphasise the import-
 -ance of the{North Wales hospital}to  
{Denbigh}as it is the{major source of  
{employment}for the area. The total    
 staff is{950}of which{600}are{nursing 
{staff-}these are not full time equiva-
 -lents.The questionaire returns showed
 the many different occupations in the 
 hospital_{Psychiatrists, Social       
{Workers,Caterers,Domestics,Gardeners, 
{Chauffers,Builders,Painters, etc etc. 
   The returns revealed a family tradi-
 -tion of working at the Hospital with 
 children following parents and grandp-
 -arents and often that{2 per household
 worked there. Some feared a further   
 decline in patient population would   
 mean fewer jobs but the survey showed 
 that a more important issue was{priva-
{-tisation}eg. of catering or cleaning.
{Any attempts in this direction would  
{be extremely unwelcome.               </content>
