 Q.What meat did they eat?             
       We ate a lot of tinned meat     
 Corned Beef was very popular and then 
 they brought out spatan which was a   
 sort of Luncheon meat which was very  
 nice.They also brought out a fish     
 called Snoek and I can remember for   
 breakfast on Sunday we always had     
 Saltfish which was salted cod soaked  
 in water overnight.I can also remember
 having Pineapple chunks and when you  
 had finished with the tin you would   
 put it on top of the ash bin so the   
 neighbours thought you were           
 posh.Sweet rationing was a D 2ozs or  
 an E quarter of a pound.A large loaf  
 was 2 new pence in 1945
