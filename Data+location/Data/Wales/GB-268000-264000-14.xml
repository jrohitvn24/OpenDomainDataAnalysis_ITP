		<content> On New Year's Day the children go     
 singing from door to door for         
 "CALENNIG".They wish the local people 
 a happy new year,and in return they   
 are given money.This is meant to bring
 luck.The local EISTEDDFOD held on the 
 Friday nearest to St. David's Day at  
 the Methodist chapel every year is a  
 110 years old.All the school children 
 take part in the afternoon,and the    
 adults in the evening.Sometimes it    
 continues into the early hours of the 
 morning.On St. David's Day all the    
 elderly and other locals have "CAWL"  
 at the school.A special service to    
 commemorate those who lost their lives
 during the war is taken by the school 
 on Armistice day,November 11th.by the 
 war memorial.Carol singers can be     
 heard one evening before Christmas    
 every year.Â£70 was collected for      
 heart research this year.             </content>
