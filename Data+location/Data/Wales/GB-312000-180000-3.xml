		<content> There is a marked contrast in house   
 types found within the area.The newer 
 areas have detached and semi-detached 
 houses in comparison tothe traditional
 areas which tend to be terraced.This  
 was usually governed by historical    
 features such as coal mining and the  
 provision of cheap houses for worker  
 accomodation.In comparison to the more
 recent houses built some of the       
 traditional houses have only recently 
 acquired bathrooms and indoor toilets.
 The modern houses have smaller rooms  
 and smaller gardens in comparison with
 the old traditional houses.It would   
 appear that with high land prices,    
 house developers are cramming new     
 housing into very small areas with    
 both 1 and 2 bedroomed houses being   
 prevalent.Considerable emphasis is    
 given to landscaping and integration  
 with existing housing.                </content>
