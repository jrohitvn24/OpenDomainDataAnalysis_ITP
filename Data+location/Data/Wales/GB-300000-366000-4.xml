 The limestone area in the east &amp; north
 east is characterised by a lack of    
 surface drainage.There is however     
 evidence of a considerable underground
 cave drainage system                  
 The main sink for the system is in the
 south of the block at 039669 whilst   
 the resurgence is 3.5 Km to the north,
 outside the block.                    
                                       
 The consequence of this underground   
 system was recently in evidence in    
 Henllan. In 1983 a bungalow on the    
 Glasfryn estate, which had been built 
 in 1977 had suffered serious cracks in
 its walls and collapse of ceilings    
 probably as a result of the collapse  
 of part of the underground cavern.
