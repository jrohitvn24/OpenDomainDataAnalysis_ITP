		<content>{Open-cast Mining:}In the late 1950's  
 came the first proposals to mine on   
 land off Plas Maen Drive, Cefnybedd.  
 Had this proceeded it would have used 
 the land on which the private housing 
 estate opposite Abermorddu Primary    
 School now stands and would have      
 extended to the boundaries of the     
 present school.                       
 In the early 1980's a modified        
 application was submitted and this has
 been strongly opposed by local        
 residents. Their spokeman, Mr.Michael 
 Barber is optimistic that the proposed
 development will not take place.      
{Village By-pass:}Abermorddu would lose
 the heavy volume of traffic it now    
 bears should the Caergwrle by-pass be 
 built.  However, opinion is divided   
 over the route the by-pass should     
 follow and until this is settled      
 villagers will have to wait.          </content>
