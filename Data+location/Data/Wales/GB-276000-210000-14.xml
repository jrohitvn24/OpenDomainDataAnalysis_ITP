           There are many different    
 types of animals in our area.Here we  
 are very lucky,as we have many        
 unspoiled woodlands therefore         
 animals such as squirrels,mice,foxes, 
 rabbits,badgers and hedgehogs are     
 thriving in our midst.                
           Down by the river-side there
 are water voles and water rats.By the 
 ponds there are frogs and toads.      
           Many people in our area love
 to hunt animals such as foxes and     
 rabbits.They do this not for food nor 
 furs but for pleasure.In spite of this
 I firmly believe that our wildlife    
 will not disappear as we have such an 
 abundunce of animals.
