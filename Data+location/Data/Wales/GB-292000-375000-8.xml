		<title>08ABERGELE FIRE SERVICE</title>
		<content> There has been a fire service in      
 Abergele since the 19th Century.  The 
 Station in Groes Lwyd opened in 1971. 
 The 12 part-time firemen all have full
 time jobs and are called by "bleeper",
 by Central Control at Rhyl.           
                                       
 There are two large appliances.  These
 carry six firemen and twenty hoses of 
 various kinds plus a wide range of    
 special equipment.  The smaller       
 landrover vehicle carries two or three
 firemen.  The men are given 4 minutes 
 to reach the station and 4 minutes to 
 reach an emergency in the area of the 
 town.  For country emergencies they   
 are allowed 20 minutes and can summon 
 additional help from Rhyl or Colwyn   
 Bay.  On average they are called out  
 200 times a year.  A fireman must be  
 at least 5'6" tall and able to carry a
 12 stone man 100 yds in 1 minute.     </content>
