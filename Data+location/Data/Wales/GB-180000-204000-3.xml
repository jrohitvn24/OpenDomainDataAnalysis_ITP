		<title>03Farming in the Dale area</title>
		<content> There are 4 large(200 acres +) and 4  
 smaller farms in the area.All the     
 large farms are engaged in mixed      
 agriculture. About half their land is 
 under crops,chiefly early potatoes and
 barley.Early potatoes are planted by  
 machine in Feb./March.They are        
 irrigated if necessary and are ready  
 for picking(by hand,owing to the      
 sloping ground)in June.Grass is then  
 sown.Barley is usually sown in Spring 
 and harvested by combine in August.The
 rest of the land is under grass;used  
 for hay,silage,grazing for beef cattle
 and wintering sheep.Ploughing is      
 usually done with a 5-blade plough.   
 Grass is cut and harvested by machine 
 and other cultivating operations are  
 done by up-to-date machinery.The      
 smaller farms use their land in a     
 specialised way,usually calf-rearing. 
 One farm is a dairy farm with 120 cows</content>
