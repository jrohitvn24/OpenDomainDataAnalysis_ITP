		<title>06The History of Newport Docks</title>
		<content>  Today we had a lecture.  I found it  
 quite interesting.  The most          
 interesting part was how the docks    
 were made bigger four times and how   
 at one time, the{South Dock}was the  }
 biggest dock in the world.  Today it  
 is only the third biggest.  Another   
 thing that was interesting was how the
 docks were used in the{Second World   
{War:}the docks were used to transport 
 bombs, tanks, aeroplanes, guns and    
 uniforms.
