		<title>15CLUBS IN TRELAWNYD</title>
		<content> The Trelawnyd Brownies were formed in 
 l97l and meet weekly at the school.   
 The pack is one of eight in the       
 Prestatyn district which is part of   
 the Rhuddlan Division of Clwyd Girl   
 Guides.                               
 The Brownies all live in the villages 
 of Trelawnyd and Trelogan.  The small 
 rural pack place the emphasis on      
 activities out in the countryside.    
 They go for nature walks and picnics. 
 They also have a small garden in the  
 school grounds which they cultivate   
 and grow plants and flowers from seed.
 Cooking and Handicraft plays a large  
 part in their Winter programme.       
 Occasionally they travel to prestatyn 
 where they join in activities with    
 other Brownies and Guides of the      
 district.
