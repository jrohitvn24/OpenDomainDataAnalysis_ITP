		<content> Housing in Chepstow has increased     
 considerably in the last few years.   
 Recently a new housing development    
 has been built in Chepstow down by the
 River Wye,thus encouraging the        
 re-development of an old part of the  
 town.The District Council had the     
 flats built so that single people     
 could rent the flats at a reasonable  
 price.The site is set out in small    
 very pleasant courts.The whole effect 
 is very attractive.The flats have a   
 fitted kitchen and a breakfast bar.   
 The bedroom is small but quite        
 adequate.The bathroom has,toilet,bath,
 sink.It also has a livingroom,little  
 gardens and parking spaces.They are   
 within easy reach of the town and     
 other local facilities.
