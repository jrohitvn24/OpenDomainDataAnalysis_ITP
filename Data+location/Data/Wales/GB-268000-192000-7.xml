 widened and small green areas or      
 playgrounds have been dotted here and 
 there. The streets are lighter and    
 airier, but the friendly, community   
 spirit still remains, thank goodness. 
 The Crymlyn area nearest to Danygraig 
 used to be littered with derelict     
 factories, but further to the east,   
 along the canal were lovely walks. I  
 remember the wild yellow irises and   
 other wild flowers which I can't put a
 name to. There were animals and birds 
 too - especially swans which lived    
 along the canal bank. The plans for   
 the whole Crymlyn area will make sure 
 that the Bog wi ll be like that again.
 There will be open spaces for birds   
 and animals but particularly for      
 people who can go and enjoy it _      
 that's what the Crymlyn Bog is all    
 about.                                </content>
