		<content>    In the Bont Newydd area there are  
 very few amenities to speak of, as    
 most of the ground cover is           
 farmland.  Of those that are there,   
 the there, the only amenities of any  
 significance are the few houses and   
 the church at Cefn.                   
    In the actual villiage of          
 Bont-Newydd there is a public house   
 which appears to survive on the money 
 it takes from the small number of     
 customers in the area.                
    The area in question is clearly    
 better suited to a ground cover survey
 rather than an amenities survey, as   
 the farms by far out number the       
 aminities.
