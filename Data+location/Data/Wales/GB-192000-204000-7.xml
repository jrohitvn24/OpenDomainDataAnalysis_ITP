		<title>07GULF OIL REFINERY</title>
		<content>    In the 1950's the population of    
 Milford Haven was declining, but in   
 the 1960's the oil companies arrived  
 taking full advantage of the deep     
 water channel to enable crude oil     
 carriers of around 250,000dwt to enter
   {Gulf Refinery,}opened in{1968}by   
 the Queen, now covers about 460 acres;
 the{processing plant}is a small area, 
 most of the site is taken up by 80    
{storage tanks.}Some of this tankage   
 holds crude oil, some, products being 
 refined and others, finished products 
 ready for transporting. Most of the   
 products leave by{sea,}but some are   
 moved by{pipeline}or{rail.}           
    The refinery produces many products
 including petrol for cars, diesel oil 
 and heating oils.
