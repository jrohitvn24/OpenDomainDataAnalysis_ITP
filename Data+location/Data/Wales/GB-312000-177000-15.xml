		<title>15Inside the Museum building.</title>
		<content> On the left there was a Yew hedge and 
 on the right there were Poplar trees. 
 Inside the castle they saw a coat of  
 arms. They also saw different chambres
 of tapestries. Then they went into the
 garden and saw a river and ducks such 
 as Moorhens, Coots, Tufted ducks and  
 Drakes. They went all over the place  
 until 2:45 p.m. The part which        
 interested me most was when they went 
 into the place which had a lot of     
 things about boats and fishing. They  
 saw a map of Wales that showed all the
 Welsh rivers; Usk, Taff, Ely, etc.    
 They saw model boats which were used  
 in olden days. They saw pictures of   
 men in boats, and one man was carrying
 a boat on his back along the shore.   
 Another thing that interested me was  
 when they went into the school. A man 
 was ringing a bell which was very much
 like a Church bell, but was smaller.  </content>
