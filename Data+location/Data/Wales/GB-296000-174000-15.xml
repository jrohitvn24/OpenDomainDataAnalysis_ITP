		<title>15Cowbridge Cattle Market</title>
		<content> John Morgan only auctioneers in       
 Cowbridge. The first farmer we        
 interviewed was Mr. Evans and he was  
 going to buy calves.He comes          
 weekly.When he buys calves, he looks  
 for the general appearance. He rears  
 cows for beef. Mr. Green rears calves.
 He likes to buy Hereford Blacks.He too
 comes every week.When he buys animals 
 he is concerned with the price. Mr.   
 Brown comes weekly to sell sheep. His 
 motto is "The price is in the pocket, 
 the judge is in the eye!".            
  All of the farmers came from the Vale
 of Glamorgan and the majority of them 
 thought that Cowbridge was a good     
 market.
