		<content> Many people have moved into the area  
 during this century especially during 
 th last 25 years.  Many of the farms  
 ar family farms which were bought by  
 the tenants of the mansions.  Several 
 of the original mansions.  Several of 
 the original mansion owners were not  
 nativesof the area but they were the  
 means of livelihood for many families 
 by employing servants, maids,         
 gardeners etc.  Nowadays there is an  
 influx of another kind, people looking
 for a quiet place to retire or trying 
 to live a self-sufficient life; others
 settling, bringing up children,       
 learning the Welsh language and       
 ecoming part of the rural community.  
 There has been a reduction in the     
 population, where there used to be 10 
 or more children in a family there are
 now 2 or 3.  The number of Welsh      
 speakers has declined.                </content>
