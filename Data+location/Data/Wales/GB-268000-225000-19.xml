		<content> There are a few badgers near the      
 school and in the valley although most
 of them life on the hillside.Often    
 there are foxes which raid the bins   
 and farms hoping to catch something to
 eat.In the spring the first flower of 
 the year is the snowdrop, later comes 
 the daffodils then the blue bells,    
 primroses and cow parsley comes       
 later.The fox gloves come later.During
 the last winter,the Red Kite,a rare   
 bird of prey was seen daily in our    
 area looking for food.The most comman 
 bird of prey is the Buzzard and these 
 nest freely in the oak wood and some  
 of the higher fir trees near the      
 school.The natural wildlife of our    
 area is very much unditurbed,the only 
 disturbance is the occasional tractor 
 or aeroplane.
