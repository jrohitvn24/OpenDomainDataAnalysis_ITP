		<content>  Mum shouts up the stairs at 7:35 but 
 I take no notice, so by the time my   
 mum gets me up it's 7:50. I go down   
 the stairs, into the bathroom and have
 a brisk wash, I then dress into my    
 school clothes and have a breakfast of
 Weetabix and oats. By the time I have 
 eaten my breakfast it is 8:00. I then 
 sit down and read a book. At 8:25 I   
 brush my hair and teeth and I put my  
 hand cream on because I suffer from   
 eczema. At 8:35 I walk to school with 
 my mum. It is 8:50 when I get to      
 school so I play football in the      
 school yard. We line up at 8:55 and   
 start lessons at 9:00, there is a     
 break at 10:30 which lasts 15 mins. I 
 eat my lunch at 12:05 and I play on   
 the yard until 1:10. School ends at   
 3:30 and I walk home. After I have my 
 tea and I have had a bath I brush my  
 teeth and go to bed.{Geraint J. Weber </content>
