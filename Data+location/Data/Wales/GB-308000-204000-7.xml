 I am Terri Ann Lancaster.I live at 121
 Glan y Nant Fochriw,with my mother,   
 father and brother Wayne.We all went  
 to Barry Island by train.The first    
 thing we did was to go to the beach   
 and I put my bathers on.I had a       
 sandwich and crisps.My cousin blind-  
 folded me and threw me into the sea.At
 mid day we had dinner.My brother and I
 rode on the donkeys.Later we walked to
 the inflatable castle.In the shows my 
 mother and I played darts.I won a     
 Minnie Mouse Poster and she won a     
 Teddy Bear.All the family went on the 
 Ghost Train and The Umbrellas.We went 
 back to see if the castle was open.It 
 was closed so we went back to the     
 station and got on the train home.We  
 got home at 9.45 p.m.
