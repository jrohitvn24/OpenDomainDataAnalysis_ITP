 Great Britain.She used to play in the 
 position of sweeper and helped to     
 defend the goal.She has represented   
 Wales 136 times in the years between  
 1963-1980.                            
     Five years ago she retired from   
 international hockey and took up the  
 post of Welsh Team Coach.Miss Ellis   
 has travelled all over the world      
 playing hockey, she collects a silver 
 spoon as a momento from each place she
 visits.                               
     In 1985 it was Ann Ellis who was  
 in charge of the Welsh Ladies hockey  
 team that played in a tournament in   
 Argentina.This was a very special trip
 because it was the first time a       
 British team had played in Argentina  
 since the Falklands War between the   
 two countries in 1982.                </content>
