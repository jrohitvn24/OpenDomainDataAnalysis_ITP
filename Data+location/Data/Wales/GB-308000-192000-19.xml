		<title>19Our Village</title>
		<content> Our homes are situated in             
 cilfynydd,which is an old mining      
 village.It is a small,qiet village    
 with only a few shops which are all in
 one street.                           
          Our homes are terraced houses
 ,as are most in our village,with dark 
 stones and grey,slate roofs.They are  
 quite big with three bedrooms,a       
 bathroom,livingroom and kitchen.my    
 grandmother and grandfather used to   
 live in my house.                     
          After school at 4:30 PM we   
 play in the streets on our roller     
 skates or bicycles or walk on the     
 surrounding mountains or the park near
 the new comprehensive school.         
          Most of the old people in    
 this village remember the coalmine    
 which was once in our village.
