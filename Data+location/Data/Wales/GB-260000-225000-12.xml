		<content>{HOUSING}-Currently planning permission
 is  only granted  for bungalows within
 the immediate confines of the village.
 95% of homes are owner - occupied,  5%
 rented by private individuals.   There
 are no council houses. 1 prefabricated
 home in the village (26/62),  1 mobile
 home (26/61) .  The village centre has
 doubled its size in 5 yrs. In the out-
 lying areas,  90%  of  the  farmhouses
 have  been  renovated  to  include  an
 inside toilet and bathroom.   Some 20%
 of the farms have lost their  original
 character due to  the influx of non  -
 farming population who demand all  the
 modern conveniences. A sizeable number
 of the houses in the  district  are at
 least a hundred years old.
