		<title>12Morlais Castle.</title>
		<content> Within the block to the north of      
 Merthyr Tydfil rises a hill which     
 dominates views to the south,west,    
 east and north.This was the best site 
 for a castle for miles around.We can  
 only look over the ruins of the castle
 today.Traces of a dry moat running    
 from the west around to the east are  
 still evident and so is the beautiful 
 arched architecture of the crypt.It is
 quite a handsome room whose stone     
 ceiling is supported by twelve elegant
 pointed arches resting on a twelve    
 sided central pillar.                 
    Some people say that the castle was
 never completed but some say there has
 been a castle on this site long before
 1265 when Gilbert De Clare erected a  
 strong outpost castle on Morlais Hill.
 We can still find the shaped coping   
 stones and corbels of towers and      
 walls.                                </content>
