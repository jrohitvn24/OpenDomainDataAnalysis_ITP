		<title>02LLANSTEFFAN VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village is a designated           
 Conservation Area. Dominated by the   
 Norman castle on its headland above   
 the Tywi estuary, the village is      
 clustered round the ancient church    
 with its 13th Century tower. Most of  
 the 230 dwellings are 19th Century or 
 earlier, stonebuilt and rendered with 
 slate roofs, and wellpreserved. Beside
 the shore is The Green, a row of      
 houses facing across the estuary. Some
 of the 20 Council houses have recently
 been bought by their tenants. There   
 are 15 Council bungalows for old      
 people, with a visiting warden. The   
 Plas is a Georgian manor house built  
 on a mediaeval site.                  
 Because many of its inhabitants work  
 in Carmarthen, Llansteffan has a      
 slight air of a commuter village, but 
 this is offset by its strongly rural  
 origins.                              </content>
