		<title>09The Glamorgan Canal</title>
		<content> The canal helped Pontypridd to become 
 a town.The canal barges were used to  
 transport coal and people.A small part
 of the canal still exists and is      
 partly filled with water. This section
 known locally as Nightingale's Bush,  
 is located just behind the Brown Lenox
 chain works.A lock still exists in the
 works' grounds and can be seen from   
 the old tow-path.There is evidence    
 of industrial waste in parts of       
 the old canal.The Glamorgan Nature    
 Trust has set up a nature reserve at  
 this spot where volunteers and        
 enthusiasts have worked hard to keep a
 supply of water there in which        
 freshwater plants and animals may     
 survive. It is interesting that so    
 much valuable work is still taking    
 place after the closure of the canal  
 as a working waterway.
