		<title>08ROYAL CHARTER MOELFRE 1</title>
		<content> On July 9th,1985 Moelfre made         
 headlines in both national and local  
 newspapers and on television. Twelve  
 professional divers have been         
 salvaging the wreck of The Royal      
 Charter for nine weeks and have made  
 spectacular discoveries.              
    The Royal Charter was a steam      
 clipper with over 450 passengers on   
 board with a cargo of gold on her way 
 from  Australia to Liverpool. On Oct. 
 26th,1859 in a freak hurricane The    
 Royal Charter was wrecked on the rocks
 at Porth Helaeth. Only 40 people      
 survived.                             
    The R.Ch's treasures are being     
 brought up daily. The divers may stay 
 here for about a year. A documentary  
 may be made and a book written about  
 this new discovery.
