		<content> Llanelli has one General Hospital.A   
 new Hospital is due to be built to    
 replace it in 1986.The site has       
 already been prepared.The Hospital has
 all the facilities for general patient
 care except Maternity Care.All        
 mothers-to-be have to travel to       
 Morriston or Carmarthen for the birth 
 of their babies.There are three homes 
 for the aged in our block together    
 with a Geriatric Hospital.Most        
 Doctor's Surgeries are new,having been
 built in the last few years to        
 accomodate larger Group               
 Practices.There are adequate Dental   
 Surgeries in Llanelli,all of which are
 in this block.There are also two      
 Clinics in the block,one of which is  
 for Schools.There are five            
 Opticians,three Chiropodists, an      
 Osteopath and two Physiotherapists in 
 the area.                             </content>
