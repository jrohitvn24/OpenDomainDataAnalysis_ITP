		<title>12LLANSTEFFAN AREA: EDUCATION</title>
		<content> A Welsh-language playgroup for        
 pre-school children, run by mothers,  
 opens on 3 mornings a week, in        
 Llansteffan hall. Llansteffan county  
 primary school serves both villages   
 since Llanybri school closed. Some    
 Llanybri children go to Llangynog.    
 Llansteffan is a pleasant modern      
 building, with 3 teachers including   
 the head, and 60 to 70 pupils. The    
 infants are divided into 2 groups,    
 Welsh and English-speaking. In the    
 other classes they are integrated and 
 taught mostly in English. Welsh is    
 taught throughout the school. The     
 children go on to one of the three    
 secondary schools in Carmarthen -     
 Queen Elizabeth Maridunum, Queen      
 Elizabeth Cambria, or Bro Myrddin     
 which is the Welsh-language one. A few
 adult evening classes are held in     
 Carmarthen.                           </content>
