		<title>12BETTWS EVAN, DYFED</title>
		<content> This name applies to an area including
 many farms and several small hamlets, 
 as well as to the small village of    
{Bettws Evan}itself. This has only a   
 telephone kiosk and church to show its
 centre. The Post Office was closed    
 some time ago, and people now have to 
 travel to{Beulah}for their nearest    
 shopping.  However there are some     
 travelling shops, fish &amp; chip van and 
 the like. Children travel on hired    
 buses to{school at Beulah or          
{Glynarthen}or are taken by parents.   
{Welsh}is still the main language,     
 although this is changing due to      
 increased number of English settling  
 in the area. The area is called Bettws
 Ifan in Welsh.
