		<content> There is little organised             
 entertainment in the area apart from  
 the occasional barn dance and         
 barbecue. A youth club for the younger
 children, organised by St Michael's   
 Church, is held each week in the      
 Ysgoldy Fach (the old school). The    
 local YFC organises a few whilst      
 drives and stages a concert but this  
 is held in Llandovery. Certain        
 functions are also organised by the   
 local W.I. At christmas, there are    
 numberous parties and fancy dress     
 party held on New Years Eve. Most     
 entertainemnt is sought outside       
 Cil-y-Cwm e.g. theatre in Llandovery  
 and cinema in Brecon and Swansea.     
 Radio and T.V. are major source of    
 entertainment in the home.Gone are    
 days of large families when           
 entertainment was provided by singing 
 and exchanging tales                  </content>
