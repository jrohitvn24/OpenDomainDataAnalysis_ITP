		<content> Of the{six schools}in Flint, we have a
{Welsh medium}Primary school, a        
{Catholic}Primary and Secondary school,
 and an{English medium}Primary and High
 school. As well as our ordinary school
 subjects, which now include computer  
 lessons, we have a wide variety of    
{extra-curricular activities.}At the   
 Gwynedd Junior school, we produce an  
 annual{school magazine.}Here is a poem
 from this year's magazine:-           
     Children play hopscotch           
     They run, jump and jog            
     They tease each other             
     Boys fight and kick and quarrel   
     Girls scream, giggle and chatter  
     Children play "tip" or "help" or  
        touch the yellow lines         
     We play hide and seek             
     And "Death Square"                
     In the playground                 
     It's noisy and busy and exciting  </content>
