		<title>13Heolgerrig Primary School.</title>
		<content> Heolgerrig Primary Schol has got eight
 classes.We have 1 nursery 3 infants   
 and 4 juniors.We have a field.It is   
 quite big.Thereare gates leading into 
 the field.We have it cut every year   
 and we have lines painted for the     
 tracks when we have our sports.       
   There are about 240 children in our 
 school.                               
   Our canteen has what we call the    
 tray system.We line up outside and    
 when we go in we help ourselves to a  
 tray and a knife and fork.When we get 
 to the dinner counter we tell the     
 ladies what we want and they will give
 it to us .They will also give us our  
 spoon with our desert.Our head        
 teachers name is Mrs.Phillips and our 
 deputy heads name is Mr.Jones.        
   I think that Mrs.Phillips runs the  
 school nicely,and when she is away she
 can rely on Mr.Jones.                 </content>
