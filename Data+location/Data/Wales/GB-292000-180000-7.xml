		<title>07LANDSCAPE - COITY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   The village of Coity has changed a  
 great deal in the last l00 years.     
   At one time it consisted of a       
 castle, a church and a few thatched   
 cottages. In these cottages lived the 
 blacksmith, the tanner and there was a
 baker. There are no thatched cottages 
 in the village now and most of the    
 original houses have been taken down. 
 There are still some old cottages like
 Orchard House which they say is over  
 200 years old. There are quite a few  
 old farm houses. There is a good      
 example of an old Welsh long house    
 near the school, it is called, TY     
 Gwyn. The walls are stone and are     
 three foot thick in places. Near our  
 school is the old well where the      
 people went for their water. It is now
 overgrown and the steps down to it    
 have disappeared.
