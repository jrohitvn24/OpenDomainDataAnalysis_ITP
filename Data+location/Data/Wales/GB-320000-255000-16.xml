		<title>16GLADESTRY CHURCH</title>
		<content> Our church belongs to the Church in   
 Wales. It was founded by King Harold  
 who was killed at the Battle of       
 Hastings in 1066. It is dedicated to  
 St Mary. Some of the walls may date   
 back to the eleventh century, but most
 of it is thirteenth century. The roof 
 is very old. It has stone tiles. The  
 tower has a pyramid spire. There are  
 five bells, but they can't be rung.   
 The Rector is Steven Prior. He is an  
 American. He doesn't live in Gladestry
 but in New Radnor. There are services 
 nearly every Sunday. Not many people  
 go, only about 10 or 20, and hardly   
 any young people go. A lot more people
 go at Christmas and at Easter, and for
 weddings, baptisms, and funerals.     
 There are always a lot of people at   
 Harvest Festivals. The Rector comes to
 our school because it is a Church in  
 Wales school.                         </content>
