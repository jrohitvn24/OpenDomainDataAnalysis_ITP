		<content>{Summary of the Grange/Butetown area.  
                                       
 The area is an inner city suburb of   
 Cardiff. It is one of the older       
 suburbs which has undergone some      
 redevelopment, both in the            
 residential and commercial areas.     
 There is a mixture of ethnic groups in
 the area.                             
                                       
 It is said that the close-knit nature 
 of the community is due to the fact   
 that one has to cross a bridge or     
 railway track to enter or leave the   
 area.                                 
                                       
 The game of Baseball is played only in
 Cardiff, Newport and Liverpool; and   
 Grangetown is said to be its home.
