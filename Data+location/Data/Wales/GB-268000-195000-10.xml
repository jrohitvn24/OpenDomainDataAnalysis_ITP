		<title>10CRYMLIN BOG</title>
		<content> Crymlin bog is a site of special      
 scientific interest.It occupies what  
 was an inlet of the sea.In medieval   
 times storms blocked the inlet and    
 since then marsh plants have covered  
 it giving 5 metres thickness of peat. 
 The whole area is waterlogged giving  
 a large reed swamp.Plants found       
 include bog pimpernel and marsh       
 forget me not.The bog also provides a 
 home for rare birds including Bearded 
 Reedlings,Water Rail &amp; Hen Harriers.  
 It is regarded as one of the most     
 important ornithological sites in     
 South Wales.Many rare insects and     
 other invertebrates are also found    
 including the Emperor Dragon Fly and  
 rare Crane flies.Crymlin bog is even  
 more remarkable for the fact that it  
 is between the M4 and B.P. Llandarcy. 
 B.P. help conserve the bog,but a      
 threat exists from rubbish dumping.   </content>
