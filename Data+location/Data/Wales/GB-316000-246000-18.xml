		<content> The following was written by Zoe      
 Abberly aged 8. She lives on a        
 farm owned by the same family for     
 generations.                          
                                       
{ I live at Llewetrog. It over-looks   
{Llanbuch-Llwyn Lake which is a natural
{lake that feeds Hay on Wye with their 
{water. It is 125 acres. We keep 600   
{sheep and 25 cows. We take our lambs  
{mainly to Builth Wells market and the 
{cattle to Brecon Market. We keep one  
{pony and a few chikens and ducks. My  
{father and Mother look after the      
{animals and we do not employ other    
{people. They have farmed it for the   
{last 13 years. My father buys and     
{sells all the animals. My Daddy and   
{Mummy own the farm. There is one barn,
{a cattle shed, a stable and a granary 
{at Llewetrog. We have 20 fields. We   
{grow 42 acres of hay and silage}(cont)</content>
