		<title>19DYFFRYN RHONDDA</title>
		<content> This is a village that grew up to     
 house workers in the local drift mines
 especially the large mine close to the
 village which produced good quality   
 coal. In order to draw attention to   
 the quality of the coal, the owners   
 christened their village Dyffryn      
 Rhondda, claiming a connection with   
 the coal from the Rhondda Valley which
 was the best around.                  
 The school that serves the village    
 contains about 30 children now, but   
 the building was obviously designed   
 for many more children to work in it, 
 so depopulation has taken place.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
