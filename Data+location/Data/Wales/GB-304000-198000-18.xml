		<title>18FARMING IN THE VALLEYS</title>
		<content> The farming in the area is mixed      
 farming with a bias towards livestock 
 farming. The climate is too wet and   
 cold to produce good arable farming.  
 There is plenty of grazing however for
 livestock.Cattle are grazed on the    
 lower slopes,where the grass is of a  
 better quality. While on the rougher  
 moorland pastures,numerous sheep are  
 to be found.                          
                                       
 These sheep are ronded up in the      
 Autumn and taken to auction or to     
 farms on the lowland for fattening.The
 pasture for the cattle is not good    
 enough for fattening either and these 
 too are sold to lowland farms for this
 purpose.                              
                                       
 The arable crops are limited mainly to
 root crops together with some barley.
