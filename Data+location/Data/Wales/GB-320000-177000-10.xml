		<title>10RUMNEY POTTERY I</title>
		<content> ON FRIDAY MAY 3rd,WE VISITED THE      
 POTTERY ON THE BANKS OF THE RHYMNEY   
 RIVER.MR GILES THE POTTER SHOWED US   
 ROUND.THE BUILDING IS VERY OLD AND HAS
 BEEN A POTTERY FOR 2 OR 3 HUNDRED     
 YEARS.HIS FAMILY HAVE BEEN POTTERS    
 THERE FOR 4 GENERATIONS.              
 NOWADAYS HE WORKS MAINLY WITH MOULDS  
 MAKING COMMEMORATIVE MUGS AND         
 PLATES WITH BRIGHT GLOSSY BLUE,GREEN  
 AND RED BLAZES.HE USED TO USE THE CLAY
 DUG FROM PITS BESIDE THE RIVER BUT    
 GAVE THIS UP IN 1955.THE LOCAL CLAY IS
 A RED BROWN COLOUR BUT IS NOT AS GOOD 
 AS THE GREY CLAY MR GILES GETS NOW    
 WHICH COMES FROM STAFFORDSHIRE WHERE  
 IT IS MIXED FROM CLAYS FROM DEVON AND 
 CORNWALL.INSIDE THE BUILDING WE SAW   
 THE OLD BRICK KILN WHICH WAS PARTLY   
 KNOCKED DOWN DURING THE WAR.THERE WERE
 ALSO REMAINS OF 3 SORTS OF PUG FOR    
 MIXING UP THE CLAY READY FOR WORKING. </content>
