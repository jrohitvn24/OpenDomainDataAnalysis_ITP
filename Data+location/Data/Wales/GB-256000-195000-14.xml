		<title>14Gowerton Cricket Club.</title>
		<content> In 1884 a report in a newspaper of the
 time told the score of a match        
 involving Gower Road C.C.This was the 
 original title of the present day     
 Gowerton C.C.The first report of a    
 match involving the Gowerton club was 
 reported in 1886.The club was founded 
 in 1880 by Major J.Roper Wright,a     
 local businessman of the time.        
       During the 1930's a dangerous   
 new way was discovered of watching the
 matches for nothing,the people would  
 climb onto the railway bridge         
 overlooking the pitch in order to view
 the games for nothing.                
       The decade 1970-1980 was a      
 memorable one for the club.In 1973    
 they reached the final of the Haig    
 Village Knockout Trophy at Lords but  
 narrowly lost.However in 1975 they    
 played Ilseham in the final and won   
 the trophy.814 teams had entered.     </content>
