		<content>    To become a member of the police   
 force you have to train for two years.
 To join the South Wales police force  
 you train for ten weeks at Cwmbran and
 three weeks in Bridgend.At the end of 
 every six months you sit an exam.When 
 qualified you work eight hours every  
 day operating a shift system.In an    
 average size police station there are 
 about one hundred police officers,    
 five of these being policewomen.      
    Some policemen will drive vehicles 
 and some will handle dogs.The most    
 popular breed of dog used is          
 alsatian.These dogs are trained in    
 Bridgend.Most police forces           
 use computers to help them in their   
 fight against crime.Policemen always  
 carry a truncheon, handcuffs, a radio 
 and a breathalyser                    
 kit.
