		<title>16Dowlais Stables.</title>
		<content> The Dowlais Stables were built in     
 1820.It is a large stone building with
 a big arch in the middle and a clock  
 and tower on the top.It was built to  
 house the many horses that worked in  
 the world famous Dowlais Ironworks.   
 There was a cottage inside the stables
 which was once used as a school for   
 the children of the ironworkers.Our   
 teacher told us that many boys of 8 or
 9 would have worked in the stables as 
 stable lads.They would have fed,      
 watered,exercised the horses as well  
 as cleaning the stables.They worked   
 very hard and were paid very poor     
 wages. I think I would have enjoyed   
 feeding and exercising the horses but 
 I'm not sure about cleaning after them
 At the moment the front of the stables
 are being repaired because it is very 
 old and has began to fall down.It will
 look very nice when it is finished.   </content>
