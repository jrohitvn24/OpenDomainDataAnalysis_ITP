		<title>14TRANSPORT IN BRYNNA</title>
		<content>                                       
 There are two main means of transport 
 in Brynna, buses+cars.The bus         
 companys are "National Welsh+Bebb".We 
 found that most people have privately 
 owned cars.Most ofthe roads in Brynna 
 are tarred and are quite clean.Lots of
 children walk to school,and people    
 walk to the shops.Children in         
 Comprehesive have a bus to take       
 them to school in Pencoed about 5     
 miles away.Over the mountain area     
 there are tracks, which have got tar  
 on them,they are quite narrow for     
 cars,but impassible for buses.
