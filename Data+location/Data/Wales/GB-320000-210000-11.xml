		<title>11PEREGRINE FALCONS</title>
		<content> Across the Kiln road we have a pair of
 Peregrine Falcons who have three      
 young.They have been watched 24 hours 
 a day,the birds are due to fly next   
 week,(23rd June-29th June 1985).      
  Over in the Coedcaenewydd farm land  
 there is a pair of buzzards.Last week 
 we were walking there when the buzzard
 flew out  of his nest and suddenly    
 the Peregrine Falcon came from        
 nowhere and attacked the buzzard then 
 the buzzard flew away behind its tree.
  The Peregrine chicks were ringed     
 almost three weeks ago when they were 
 still quite young.The Peregrine Falcon
 is mainly a grey-blue colour with an  
 orangey-yellow throat.Its usual speed 
 is 280km/h on a dive or 200km/h while 
 flying at its usual speed.            
  Usualy the Peregrine Falcons like    
 rocky cliffs by the sea,but ours has  
 chosen an unusual place near the road.</content>
