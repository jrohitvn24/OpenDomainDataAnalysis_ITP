		<content> The vast majority of newcomers seem   
 to retain their inner city            
 mentality and keep themselves very    
 much to themselves. Which is fine     
 whilst                                
 the person concerned is living in the 
 city, but tends to upset the          
 inhabitants of a closely integrated   
 village.                              
 Unless many more of these young people
 start taking an interest in the       
 community life going on around them,  
 instead of just using the vllage as a 
 place to commute to and from work,    
 relationships will not improve to any 
 great extent. The old people of the   
 village miss the ability they used to 
 have of being able to walk into almost
 any house in the village, just for a  
 chat. And that is a great shame.
