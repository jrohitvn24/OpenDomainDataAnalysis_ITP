		<title>11A TYPICAL DAY (CONT)</title>
		<content> After football on Thursdays we have a 
 music lesson,then at three thirty it's
 time to go home.We always sing a      
 prayer at this time of day to thank   
 God for everything.We arrive home at  
 about four,and we have our tea and jam
 sandwiches.Then I play on my motorbike
 ,a yamaha 80 c.c. for an hour.Between 
 five and six I do my homework,and half
 an hour later we sit down for our     
 supper.After supper we watch          
 television until half past eight,then 
 we get ready for bed.I brush my teeth 
 and wash my hands and face,then settle
 down ready for sleep.I'm usually well 
 away by about nine o'clock.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
