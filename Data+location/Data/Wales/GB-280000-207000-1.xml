		<title>01SEVEN SISTERS</title>
		<content>{Seven Sisters}is a village in the     
 Dulais valley.It appeared about 100   
 years ago when the local landowner    
 sank a coal mine.It is bounded by     
 Hirfynydd(south),y Drum(north)and     
 March Hywel(west).The principal       
 industry was coal-mining up until the 
 mine closed in 1963.The village took  
 its name from the pit and was never   
 officially named except by custom and 
 practice.Today most of the work-force 
 have to commute to their places of    
 work.The majority work either at the  
 Rhigos trading estate ,Blaen-nant     
 colliery or Lucas Industries at       
 Ystradgynlais.The Forestry Commission 
 have planted conifer plantations on   
 the hills around the village and the  
 N.C.B.have cleared the colliery site  
 and the old coal refuse tips.Open cast
 and small mines are also found        
 locally.                              </content>
