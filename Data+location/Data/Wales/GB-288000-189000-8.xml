		<title>08Pontycymer's remaining mine</title>
		<content>  The Garw colliery is the only mine   
 still open in Pontycymer, and the     
 largest employer.                     
  Even though the Ffaldau colliery has 
 closed, it is merged with the Garw    
 colliery resulting in more than eleven
 miles of underground roadway . There  
 are just under 4 miles of high-speed  
 conveyer belts which transfer coal to 
 the shafts and the washery.           
  The length of a coal face is about   
 200 metres , each face holding some   
 Â£0.5 million of equiptment.           
  Coal producton averages 240000 tonnes
 per year. The coal is of excellent    
 quality especialy useful as house coal
 while  the steel industry uses the    
 more inferior. Workable coal reserves 
 are estimated at 7.5 million tonnes,  
 as elswhere in South Wales geological 
 problems reduce output per man and    
 increase the production cost.         </content>
