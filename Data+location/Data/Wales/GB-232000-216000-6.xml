		<content> There is no secondary sshool in our   
 block,however there are two small     
 primary schools.One is a Couty Primary
 and the other a Voluntary Controlled. 
 Both are two teacher schools with     
 around 40 pupils each.                
 One kitchen supplies meals to both    
 shools,this employs a cook and a      
 kitchen assistant.Around 80% of the   
 pupils buy school lunches,which cost  
 60p per day.                          
 All children in the county are taught 
 in Welsh and English,and playground   
 games are played in both languages.   
 There are no nursery schools in the   
 block but there is a mother and       
 toddler group.                        
 Secondary children are taken by bus to
 either Carmarthen or St Clears,they   
 have the option of English or Welsh   
 first language education.
