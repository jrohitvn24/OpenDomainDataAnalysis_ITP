		<title>16Shops in Kilgetty.</title>
		<content> Clare, Verity, Michael and Kaye       
 visited shops in Kilgetty.  Streamline
 House has a Mr. John in charge and 8  
 people work there.  It is open from   
 9 a.m. till 6 p.m.  They sell carpets,
 furniture, beds and shoes.  It was    
 opened in March l98l.  They had a     
 Sinclair C5 outside which Tenby Lions 
 Club were offering as a raffle prize. 
 The man in charge of the Newsagents   
 next door did not talk to us very     
 sensibly.  The shop opened in August  
 last year.  6 part time assistants    
 work there.  Customers are local,     
 different from the Streamline shop    
 which has customers from the whole of 
 the County.  The Kilgetty railway halt
 is opposite and the train goes under a
 very low bridge where vehicles had to 
 pass in the centre and which was one  
 of the reason why the new Kilgetty by 
 pass was opened in l984.              </content>
