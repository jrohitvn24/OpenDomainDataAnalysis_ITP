		<content> A very rural area with the small      
 villages of Garth &amp; Beulah as popul-  
 ation centres.Character of villages is
 slowly being lost as young people grav
 -itate to market town of Builth. Homes
 are becoming holiday cottages.New     
 people enter the area from England,   
 many adjust well and join in          
 community life. These changes more    
 apparent in Beulah. Both villages now 
 have pavements and street lighting,   
 because of traffic on A483.Much heavy 
 goods traffic from North England to   
 South Wales,also considerable holiday 
 traffic to South and West Wales,and   
 market and forestry lorries. The farms
 are prosperous, mainly worked by young
 people and the new school at Garth is 
 full to capacity. A law abiding       
 community policed from Builth Wells .
