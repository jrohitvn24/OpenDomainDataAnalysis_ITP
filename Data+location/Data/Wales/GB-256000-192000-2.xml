		<title>02EBENEZER CHAPEL,DUNVANT</title>
		<content> In 1872 a small chapel was erected to 
 serve the village,bilingual services  
 being taken by the minister of Three  
 Crosses Chapel.By 1876 membership had 
 increased and a minister was appointed
 to take sole charge.Growth in local   
 mining brought an increase in popul-  
 ation.The original chapel was enlarged
 by adding a corrugated iron structure 
 but even this later proved inadequate 
 to cater for the increased membership 
 and in 1893 the present chapel was    
 built to accommodate 500 people.The   
 chapel was the cultural and social    
 centre of the village.Closure of local
 industries led to a decline in popul- 
 ation and consequently of the chapel  
 membership but it remains an important
 element of village life.The Vestry is 
 used for meetings of senior citizens,a
 horticultural society and a Welsh-    
 speaking playgroup.                   </content>
