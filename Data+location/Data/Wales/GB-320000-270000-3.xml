		<content> Farming Dominates this area. Over     
 seventy-five percent of the population
 depend upon it for their livelihood.  
 Adverse physical factors, e.g. poor   
 soils, steep slopes, climate, confine 
 agricultural activity in the area to  
 the production of livestock.          
 Small family farms are engaged in the 
 raising of 'stores', both sheep and   
 cattle. Sheep are the most important  
 enterprise. Store lambs are reared for
 subsequent fattening by the lowland   
 farmers. However, in recent years "fat
 lamb production" has increased within 
 the area. Breeding ewes are forwarded 
 in the autumn, although this custom is
 dying out.                            
 Large numbers of store cattle are sold
 in October and November by which means
 the farmers of the area reduce their  
 stock for the winter. Crop cultivation
 mainly grass is for fodder.           </content>
