		<title>01Northern Slope of Snowdon</title>
		<content> This area consists of the land rising 
 from 100 metres above sea level to 500
 metres. The lower area consists of    
 Llyn Peris, a lake which is used in a 
 hydro-electric pump storage scheme by 
 the CEGB; &amp; a very small area of level
 land on which the residential part of 
 Llanberis village lies. The higher    
 land has recently seen changes; large 
 scale fencing to contain sheep, &amp;     
 drainage of peat bogs to improve the  
 pasture has taken place. Remote farm- 
 houses &amp; drystone walls are in dis-   
 repair. Feral goats still roam at will
 in the planted mixed woodland &amp; open  
 mountain slopes. The increased number 
 of mountain walkers has lead to       
 substantial improvements in the       
 footpaths. Over 400,000 walkers go    
 part way up Snowdon annually!
