		<title>15Religion in Gwyddelwern</title>
		<content> There are three places of worship-the 
{Parish Church of St Bueno (Church in  
{Wales), the Methodist Chapel}and the  
{Presbyterian}Chapel. There is one     
 resident minister who lives at the    
 Presbyterian Manse. The villagers are 
 fairly evently divided between these  
 three with a slight bias towards      
 non-conformism. There is no religious 
 bigotry in the village. The{Church in 
{Wales}is served by a Curate in Charge,
 who cares for the surrounding parish  
 under the Rector of Corwen. Services  
 are held every sunday, three times a  
 month in English once in Welsh. The   
 prayer books are printed bilingually  
 on facing pages. The Methodist Chapel 
 is an imposing building on the main   
 road built in 1900. A Welsh service is
 held every week and the congregation  
 is drawn from scattered farms and the 
 village.                              </content>
