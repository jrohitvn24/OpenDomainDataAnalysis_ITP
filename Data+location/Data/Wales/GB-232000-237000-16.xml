		<title>16BETHEL BAPTIST CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The chapel was opened in 1809 and     
 extended in 1840, by building higher  
 walls and placing new pews and a      
 gallery. The present building was     
 opened in 1890. The centenary services
 of the cause were held in September   
 1893 and the vestry was built in 1923 
 on the site of the old chapel. The    
 church cemetery, which was donated by 
 the late John Lewis, Cambrian, was    
 consecrated in 1929. Today the chapel 
 stands prominently in the heart of the
 village of Drefach, with the Reverend 
 John Lewis as minister since 1974. Due
 to the prominence of the woollen      
 industry Bethel has been a very strong
 chapel with membership exceeding 350  
 but with the decline of employment the
 number has fallen to 150.Soon I will  
 be baptised as a full member and proud
 to follow the footsteps of my parents 
 and late grandparents.  {NIA WYN JONES</content>
