		<content> Unlike some rural regions we are not  
 suffering from depopulation but from  
 'deruralisation'. People born in this 
 locality cannot find jobs and have to 
 move to towns; small cottages become  
 empty and are bought by young,well-   
 paid executives who commute to the    
 nearby towns of Bristol,Cardiff and   
 Newport.                              
 The new country dwellers are likely to
 be approaching middle-age with        
 children beyond primary school age,so 
 the village school in Penallt is due  
 to be closed soon.                    
 Many houses are bought by retired city
 people,leaving none cheap enough for  
 first time buyers,thus creating a bias
 towards the elderly or wealthy.       
 Most families have private transport, 
 so bus services may be withdrawn,the  
 village shop has closed,and we are    
 rapidly becoming a commuter community.</content>
