 1945 when the people of Presteigne    
 heard that the{Second World War}was   
 over.They heard the news on the       
{radio.Street parties}were were        
 organised and a{bonfire}was lit that  
 evening on a hill outside the town.The
 town raised money for the soldiers and
 gave them so much each.               
      During the war the church tower  
 was used as a{look out post.}They     
 looked for enemy aeroplanes to find   
 out in which direction they were      
 going.The local die castings factory  
 made{bullets.                         
     To celebrate the{40th anniversary 
{of V.E.Day}a dinner and dance was held
 at the{Memorial Hall,}which was built 
 as the town's memorial to the men from
 this area, who died during the        
 war.                                  </content>
