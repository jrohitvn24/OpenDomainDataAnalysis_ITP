		<title>06THE MINERS' STRIKE 1984-5</title>
		<content>  During the {miner's strike }my family
 lived on Â£18.00 a week.We found it    
 very hard to believe that there would 
 be no more sweets from 5 March 1984   
 until 5 March 1985. We had a parcel   
 delivered every Friday of each week.  
 We had a tin of soup,a tin of carrots 
 and a tin of spaghetti,beans or       
 ravioli. We also had a tin of meat and
 potatoes.                             
    We found that the hardest part of  
 the strike was when christmas came    
 along.My parents explained that I     
 could not have all that I wanted. We  
 also found it hard to pay our bills.  
 When we phoned the place where we paid
 our bills they froze them.So when the 
 end of the strike came,we started     
 paying our bills again.
