  in the one of the front gardens,and  
  a short service was held,Each sunday 
  school had its banner,and all then   
  marched in procession round Newbridge
  singing hymns.After tea sports came  
  with music and dancing and icecream. 
  People used to be baptised in the    
  River Ebbw near school.              
          "MONKEY PARADE"              
  After church all the boys would walk 
  down to Abercarn and the girls would 
  walk down often on the other side of 
  the road.Later boys would ask to walk
  the girls home.The Old Bog (Where the
  comprehensive school's new sports    
  field is) was used by boys for       
  cricket.A stream ran down from the   
  Pant(no housing estate then).Poor,   
  elderly people used to build shacks  
  by the stream.
