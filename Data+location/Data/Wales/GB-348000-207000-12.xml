		<content> My name is Sarah Allpress;I spent my  
 childhood on a farm in Cornwall but   
 went to study fine art in  Bristol    
 for four years and gained a 1st       
 class honours degree in l975. I sell  
 my work through exhibitions such as   
 the Royal Academy summer show,        
 galleries and privately.              
 My paintings are done in oil on canvas
 measuring 5'x 6' which take about two 
 months to complete. I paint from life 
 and from composite drawings in the    
 studio.                               
 My images are trees,grass,ferns,walls,
 pathways - and details of these.      
 Within my landscapes I use figures and
 1985 images - cars,pylons,and road    
 signs. The subject matter is often a  
 small family event in a large land-   
 scape,such as a walk in a park.       
 I am at present learning anatomy for  
 my work is shifting towards figures.  </content>
