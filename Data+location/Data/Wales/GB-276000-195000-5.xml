		<content> For the game {longlamp} you need at   
 least 3 people. One or 2 people can go
 "on it" but one is more likely . We   
 play {longlamp} on the schoolyard.    
 People who are not "on it" stay at one
 end of the yard. The person "on it"   
 chooses someone randomly; this person 
 must dodge past the person "on it" to 
 get to the other end of the yard . If 
 this person is not successful, i.e. is
 caught , he/she is "on it" also , and 
 chooses ,randomly , the next runner . 
 If "stampede" is called all runners   
 attempt to pass . The game is most    
 exciting when played by 2 "gangs" ,   
 one "on it" one not . The last person 
 to be caught restarts the game . I    
 chose to describe this game because it
 is exciting, although rough . A       
 similar game, {bulldog}, differs only 
 in that people caught must be floored.
