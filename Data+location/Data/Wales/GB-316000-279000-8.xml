 to be for individuals rather than     
 teams. There is ample opportunity for 
 fishing. The River Teme provides some 
 of the best trout-fishing in Wales.   
 Horse-riding is quite popular and the 
 Teme Valley Hunt meets in the area    
 numerous times during the hunting     
 season.There is plenty of opportunity 
 for shooting game. Beguildy School    
 Swimming Pool is used a lot in warm   
 weather. Several boys take part in    
 motorcycle scrambling competitions.   
    The only team sport based in the   
 survey area is tug o' war. Felindre   
 Tug o' War team has built an excellent
 record for itself since it was formed 
 in 1970. The team has won the Welsh   
 Tug o' War Championships many times   
 including this year and has           
 represented Wales in the 640 and 560kg
 weight in many parts of the world.    </content>
