		<title>18The New Telephone Exchange</title>
		<content> In June 1985 we visited the telephone 
 exchange on the Graig.First we went to
 the cable chamber but before we went  
 in Mr Coates checked to see if it was 
 safe by using this little box.When we 
 were inside there were thick black    
 cables,with thousands of smaller wires
 inside.Air was in these all the time  
 at a certain pressure,so if there was 
 a hole in the pipe,the air inside     
 would push out and no water would be  
 able to get in and damage the wires.  
 This exchange is more modern than the 
 one in Pontypridd.Built in 1973,the   
 wires were put in in 1975.This is not 
 the most modern exchange.The TXK1     
 Exchange is the most modern.In a week 
 about 2,000,000 calls go through the  
 exchange.Altogether 70 people work    
 there,but only 10 of these maintain   
 the exchange.
