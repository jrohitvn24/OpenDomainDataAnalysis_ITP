		<content> Harold Johns gives employment to about
 seven people and is a dealer in farm  
 machinery.  He repairs tractors and   
 other agricultural implements.  He    
 also sells spare parts such as tractor
 tyres.                                
 Harold Johns buys a lot of the        
 machinery at farm sales in other parts
 of the country, especially            
 Cambridgeshire and the Midlands.      
 Although he sells mainly to local     
 farmers, he has also exported tractors
 to Ireland and Europe.  He owns a     
 small farm opposite the school on     
 which he keeps some cattle.  He also  
 has two duck ponds in which he keeps  
 ducks and trout.  He allows the Curre 
 Hunt to go hunting on his land as     
 there are many foxes that live in the 
 woods nearby.
