		<content>  Magor and Undy are small villages in 
 south_east Gwent,situated             
 between.Caldicot and Newport,about    
 half a mile off the M4 junction.It's  
 close to the cities of Cardiff and    
 Bristol , this goegraphical position  
 makes the village an ideal area for   
 development ,and is one reason for the
 major changes taking place.The        
 development is already well on it's   
 way,with plans to combine the villages
 of Magor and Undy and raise their     
 population from the present 1,500 to a
 population of 5,500 in the late 1980's
  The surrounding area taken up by     
 farming on low lying ground reclaimed 
 from the sea.An area of concern is the
 affect development will have on the   
 Marshland Reserve.It is hoped the     
 closeness of the reserve to the       
 village,with increasing population    
 will not affect the habitat.          </content>
