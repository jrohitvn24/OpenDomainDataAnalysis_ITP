		<title>15The Brecon Mountain Railway.</title>
		<content> Merthyr's newest tourist attraction is
 the Brecon Mountain Railway which     
 starts its journey at Pant railway    
 station and runs into the magnificent 
 Brecon Beacons National Park.Two miles
 of line is now open with a further 8  
 miles to open at a later date.It is a 
 narrow gauge railway with some very   
 attractive engines and passenger      
 coaches.                              
         During last Summer term our   
 class went on the railway as part of  
 our project on transport.It was really
 exciting travelling on a steam train. 
 The driver sounded the hooter as we   
 set off.The view from the train is    
 really beautiful.We saw mountains and 
 reservoirs and wild primroses.When we 
 got off the train we had a picnic and 
 watched the sailing boats on the      
 reservoir.On the way back some of us  
 pretended to be engine drivers.       </content>
