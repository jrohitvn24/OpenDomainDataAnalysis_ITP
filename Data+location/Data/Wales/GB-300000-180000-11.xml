		<title>11Llanilid Opencast Coal Site</title>
		<content> In the area surveyed by our school the
 only remaining primary industry is the
 Llanilid Open Cast Coal Site located  
 between Llanhari and Llanharan. The   
 works was opened in 1970 and          
 is owned and run by Derek Crouch,     
 Contractors on behalf of the Open     
 Cast Executive of the National        
 Coal Board.The site covers an         
 area of approximately 3200 hectares   
 and has a maximum depth of nearly 140 
 metres.The amount of coal produced    
 weekly ranges from 5000 tons to 8000  
 tons.There is a possibility of        
 extending the site in the future to   
 the west of the present workings      
 towards Pencoed. The Open Cast Site is
 an important local employer and       
 provides jobs for 240 people.
