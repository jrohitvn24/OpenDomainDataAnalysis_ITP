		<title>16Llangyfelach Church (Contd.)</title>
		<content> The churchyard is very untidy with    
 weeds arund the grave-stones.         
                                       
 The church is made from three kinds of
 stone. On the roof are greeny slates. 
 The windows are patterned and have    
 small panes of glass. There is a      
 carving of St. David above the porch. 
 He is holding a staff which has been  
 repaired after being broken by        
 vandals.                              
                                       
 Inside the church is a stone cross    
 which is one thousand years old. There
 is a painting by Evan Walters called  
 'Communion In Pentonville Prison'.    
 There is a beautiful wooden screen    
 near the altar.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
