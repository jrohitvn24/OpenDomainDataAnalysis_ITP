		<content>      We have three small shopping     
 areas as well as the easily accessible
 large town centre .In the survey we   
 discovered that older people found    
 these facilities quite adequate,while 
 others had to go further afield for   
 their needs.All these areas have at   
 least one fish and chip shop while    
 only one area has a chemist (it has   
 two). Many people felt that a chemist 
 in the other areas was needed.All     
 areas have food shops and also some   
 form of craft or recreational         
 shop.Most people feel that bigger     
 shops should be brought into the town.
      There are three sub-post         
 offices,a couple of hardware stores   
 and other specialist shops to cater   
 for the varing needs of the community.
