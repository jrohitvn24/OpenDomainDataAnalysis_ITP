		<content>   This small market town of some      
 11000 people, is situated on the banks
 of the Western Cleddau and is roughly 
 in the centre of the old county of    
 Pemrokeshire now part of Dyfed.       
   The town exists mainly to serve as  
 an administrative and commercial      
 centre for the surrounding rural area 
 and has, therefore, many banks,       
 offices, various services H.Q's, with 
 a sprinkling of agricultural merchants
 and engineers. There is also a weekly 
 cattle market which is quite large and
 reflects the largely livestock farming
 of the area. There are also a number  
 of auctioneers offices with a large   
 part of their business from farming.  
    With much recent building for      
 residential use and developments such 
 as the new covered market and         
 pedestrianisation the town is changing
 rapidly.                              </content>
