		<title>03MARFORD MILL</title>
		<content> The name Marford originates way back  
 to the year 500 AD. It was first known
 as {Mereford}; the word{mere}meaning a
 boundary and the word{ford}meaning a  
 crossing of a river_in this case the  
 River Alyn.                           
 The township name of Mereford became  
 shortened to Merford which eventually 
 changed to Marford.                   
 Initially Marford had its own quern_a 
 pestle and mortar type implement.This 
 was housed in a building which is now 
 known as Marford Mill.                
 Each small township had its own water 
 powered mill. For Marford it was      
 Marford Mill. Marford Mill was built  
 between 800 and 900 AD and then it was
 knocked down because the people of    
 Marford wanted their own mill.        
 In 1790 a famous painter named Turner 
 painted a picture of the mill.
