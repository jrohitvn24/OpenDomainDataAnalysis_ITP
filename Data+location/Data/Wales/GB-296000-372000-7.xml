		<content> BODELWYDDAN CASTLE continuedthis      
 report appeared in the Liverpool Daily
 Post on 18th Sept., 1985. "Work has   
 started on what will be the home for  
 the National Portrait Gallery at      
 Bodelwyddan Castle.  The Castle was   
 bought by Clwyd County Council for    
 transformation with a museum, arts,   
 and education complex.  It will become
 the gallery's third out station in the
 region with more than 100 portraits of
 famous Victorian figures.  Council    
 Chairman, Cllr. Edgar Jones, said,    
 "The gallery's decision to locate in  
 Clwyd was a tremendous addition to the
 County's cultural facilities and would
 give an added dimension to the local  
 tourist industry.  It will provide an 
 immensely prestigious core for the    
 cultural centre, being developed at   
 the Castle."
