 farmland for use as sports fields in  
 the mid-sixties.There now exist soccer
 &amp; cricket pitches as well as a play   
 area for children and a modern        
 pavilion which houses the local 9-18  
 Youth-Club.Rhewl F.C. competes in the 
 Summer League since many players play 
 for town clubs in the winter within   
 the N.Wales League.                   
 The school is used for Evening Classes
 and P.T.A.activities e.g.Whist Drives
