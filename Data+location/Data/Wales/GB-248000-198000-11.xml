		<content> The Parish Church.                    
    The present Parish Church is nearly
 100 years old,but its tower dates from
 1200. All services were in Welsh until
 recently when a bilingual Communion   
 Service was introduced so that more   
 parishioners could use the Mother     
 Church                                
  The Roman Catholic Church is expected
 to be demolished this year because    
 of its dangerous condition,and a new  
 one built,if money is available.      
  Both the Church in Wales and the     
 Roman Catholic Church have Voluntary  
 Aided Primary Schools in the block.   
  Attendance at many Welsh Chapels is  
 very low,but Chapels where the        
 services are in English are usually   
 better attended.
