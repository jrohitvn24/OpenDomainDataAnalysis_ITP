		<title>18THE WELSH LANGUAGE</title>
		<content> Most grandparents of children at the  
 school are Welsh speakers, but the    
 parents of the children are not. The  
 language is a popular subject among   
 the children at the school however and
 may revive.                           
 The patterns of Welsh sentence survive
 in the English used by the people in  
 the area especially in the order of   
 the phrases:e.g.                      
{It's only now I've sat down           
{Tell him it's this afternoon I'll come
 Where is it?{By the television it is. 
 Sometimes the words reflect the Welsh 
{She's lost the bus}  (lost = missed)  
{Mae hi wedi colli'r bws (Colli}=lost) 
{Mam =}grandmother (from{Mamgu})       
 Sometimes Welsh words intrude         
 un-noticed in English sentences. e.g. 
 I don't like to{poeni}people.         
{( Poeni}= worry)                      
                                       </content>
