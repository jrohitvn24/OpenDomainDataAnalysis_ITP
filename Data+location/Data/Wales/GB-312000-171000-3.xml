		<content> Michaelston-le-Pit is only four miles 
 from the capital of Wales, but it is a
 village with no through road, no      
 railway and no post office or school. 
  Its only public building, the Church 
 of St Michael and All Angels,is set in
 the hollow which gives the village its
 name, and its secluded position has   
 saved it from depredation and even    
 from too drastic a restoration.       
 It is a Norman foundation, its first  
 known records being dated 12O3.   Its 
 present building is cruciform in shape
 and the roof of the south porch is    
 supported on the original wooden      
 trusses and the mid-fourteenth century
 doorway still bears traces of the     
 original moldings.   The shapes of the
 five windows in the nave illustrate   
 successive stages of development from 
 Early English to Perpendicular.
