		<content> In the winter we don't do much except 
 feed the sheep. April is the time for 
 lambing. I sometimes get up in the    
 night to go and look at the ewes.     
 After lambing we have time to clean   
 out the sheds. In June we have to take
 the wool off the ewes so they won't   
 get hot. After shearing we dip the    
 ewes so they won't get flies, because 
 if they do the flies lay eggs and the 
 sheep get maggots and die. We let them
 go back into a field and in a month's 
 time we dip them again. In late       
 October we put the ram to the ewes. If
 it snows we have to go round in the   
 tractor to look for ewes and dig them 
 out.
