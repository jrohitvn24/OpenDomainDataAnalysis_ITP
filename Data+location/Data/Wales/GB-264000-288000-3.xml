		<content> TALYBONT PRIMARY SCHOOL CONT.         
 The children of Talybont school have a
 choice of two Secondary schools at    
 Aberystwyth either Penweddig School   
 which is a Welsh medium comprehensive 
 school or Penglais School which is an 
 English medium comprehensive          
 school.This year 7 of the children    
 will enter Penweddig while 5 will     
 enter Penglais.                       
 There is an old school at Talybont    
 which opened in 1875 and which has a  
 very interesting history. There were  
 only two classrooms in the school but 
 there was at one time over 200 pupils 
 at the school! We moan now when there 
 are more than 25 children in the class
 because of the lack of space. The old 
 school is now used by a private school
 from the Midlands who use it as a base
 for field courses in the area.
