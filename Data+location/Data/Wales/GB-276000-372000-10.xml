		<content>      Bodnant Gardens, situated above  
 the River Conwyon the east side of the
 valley, enjoy magnificent viewsof     
 Snowdonia. Access is from a minor road
 leading to the village of Eglwysbach  
 off the A470. The gardens are world   
 renowned and cover some 80 acres. they
 were presented to the National Trust  
 by Henry Duncan, second Baron         
 Aberconwy, in 1949. The gardens are   
 supervised for the trust by Lord      
 Aberconwyand the head gardener Mr     
 Martin Puddle. The soil is composed of
 a stiff boulder clay overlying a      
 friable shale bedrock. The mild       
 climate enables a variety of species  
 to grow and the garden is noted for   
 its collection of trees. Opening hours
 are from 10am until 5 pm daily from   
 March to October.
