		<title>11Sailing in Mumbles</title>
		<content>    Mumbles is a sheltered bay with    
 moorings.It does not cost anything to 
 moor your boat in the sea.There are   
 two yacht clubs, Mumbles Yacht Club   
 and the Bristol Channel Yacht Club.   
 The M.Y.C. tends to do the most       
 sailing.It has one thousand and two   
 members exactly. Last year about one  
 hundred and thirty people joined.The  
 classes they race are Lasers,         
 Albacores,G.P.14 and Cruisers. Ospreys
 and Mirrors have become less popular. 
 The building of the Knab Rock         
 Development took from 1983-84 and it  
 enables major sailing championships to
 be held in Mumbles. The Mirror World  
 Championships took place in 1983 and  
 the G.P.14 will take place in 1985.   
 There will be 160-200 boats for the   
 G.P.14 championships. There is a      
 Swansea Bay week which is for         
 cruisers.By Stephen Diehl.            </content>
