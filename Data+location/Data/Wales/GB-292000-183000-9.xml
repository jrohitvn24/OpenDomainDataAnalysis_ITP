		<title>09Carnival and fete.</title>
		<content>  I think that the most enjoyable      
 social event held in the village is   
 the Carnival and Fete. Last Saturday  
 we held the 1985 Carnival. Six weeks  
 ago Sarah James was chosen as the     
 Carnival Queen and I was chosen as one
 of her attendants.                    
  By 1.00.pm. on Saturday the village  
 was alive with excitment. Stalls and  
 booths had been set up on the wide    
 verges along Pant Hirwaun and people  
 were gathering, many dressed to join  
 in the Carnival Parade.               
  At 1.05.pm. Mr. George announced the 
 commencement of the Carnival,The Jazz 
 Band struck up a lively tune and the  
 Parade set off through the village.   
 People cheered as we passed through   
 the streets. We returned to enjoy the 
 judging,sports,games etc. It was a    
 wonderful day and a large sum was     
 collected for charity. (Group D.)J.O. </content>
