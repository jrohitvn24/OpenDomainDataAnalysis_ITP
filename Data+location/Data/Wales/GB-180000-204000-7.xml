		<title>07Religion-Dale + St.Ishmaels</title>
		<content> There are two churches in our area,   
 both belonging to the Anglican        
 denomination.One is St.James' Church, 
 Dale and the other is St.Ishmael's    
 Church which gives its name to the    
 nearby village.St.James' Church is    
 estimated to be about 800 years old   
 though it was renovated early this    
 century.It is a small,simple church   
 with a nave,chancel and tower housing 
 one bell.It is built of stone and     
 rendered with rough-cast cement.It has
 wooden pews to seat about 110.The     
 vicar,Rev.P.Davies, also takes charge 
 of the two neighbouring parishes.St.  
 Ishmael's church was first founded    
 1300 years ago,possibly part of an    
 ancient monastery.It too has been     
 renovated and is built of stone. It   
 has pews to seat about 140 in the nave
 and two transepts.The vicar here is   
 Rev.W.Lewis.                          </content>
