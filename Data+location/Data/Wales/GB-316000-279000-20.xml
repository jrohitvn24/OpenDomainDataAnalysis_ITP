		<title>20   THE DEVIL'S STONE</title>
		<content> In the middle of a field belonging to 
 Pantycaragle, a farm near Beguildy    
 School, is a big stone and a local    
 legend explains how it got there. At  
 Craig Don Wood,between Knucklas and   
 Knighton is a large rock known as The 
 Devil's Chair. One day the Devil was  
 sitting in his chair planning evil    
 deeds. He decided to destroy Beguildy 
 Church. He picked up a large boulder  
 and threw it,shouting "Hey up!" This  
 was for people to get out of the way. 
 Acoording to the legend this is how   
 the village of Heyope got its name.The
 boulder fell short and landed in the  
 field where it lies to this day. The  
 church at Beguildy is dedicated to St.
 Michael who saved it from destruction.
 Every time the land-owner has tried to
 move the stone there has been a great 
 storm. God wants the stone left there 
 as a reminder that Good defeats Evil. </content>
