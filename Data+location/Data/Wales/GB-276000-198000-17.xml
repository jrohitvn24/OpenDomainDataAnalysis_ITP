		<title>17WELSH MOUNTAIN FARMS-NEATH-1</title>
		<content>    My group studied the area between  
 the{A4109}road,the{Dulais Valley}road,
 and the{A465,}the{Vale of Neath}road. 
 There are several large farms on the  
 hillsides and also on the mountain    
 called{Hirfynydd.}                    
    The biggest farm is Lletty-r-afel  
 and consists of{600 acres.}It         
 specialises in the{rearing of sheep   
{and cattle,}but the most interesting  
 feature is the farmhouse itself. It is
 between{200 and 300 years old}and is a
 typical{Welsh mountain farmhouse.}The 
 farmer gets his water from a spring.  
 It is a very quiet place. The farmer  
 owns a mixed herd of cattle - there is
 a Charolais bull as well as Aberdeen  
 Angus cows.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
