		<content> The distribution of buildings is      
 mainly on the lower valley sides above
 the flood-plain of the Cynon, mostly  
 following the natural contour pattern 
 of the landscape or along the major   
 roads in the linear formation.  Most  
 of the buildings are residential,     
 either private or council houses.  On 
 the western side of the valley are    
 typical rows of terraced houses built 
 quickly during the rise of coal       
 mining in South Wales.These houses are
 built mainly from the local Pennant   
 Sandstone rock. New council houses are
 present, but appear to have a wider   
 distribution on the eastern side of   
 the valley. Besides houses flats are  
 common. Private houses and other      
 buildings tend to be located away from
 the Phurnacite, on the sunnier eastern
 side of the valley.
