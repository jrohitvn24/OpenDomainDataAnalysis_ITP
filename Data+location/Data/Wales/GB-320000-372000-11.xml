		<content> I go to Saint Richard Gwyn High School
 in Flint, I am in the first year and  
 study various subjects.               
                                       
 The main lessons are English and Maths
 we have five thirty-five minute       
 periods of each during the week. As my
 school is in North Wales we have Welsh
 lessons each week, we also study      
 French. I find French more enjoyable  
 than Welsh, which is a waste of time. 
 My favourite lesson is science, we do 
 many different things which I find    
 enjoyable like testing soil. We have  
 Combined Studies, Games and Physical  
 Education. In winter we play netball  
 and hockey in summer rounders and     
 athletics. My school is catholic so we
 have assemblies on Monday, Thursday   
 and Friday. We have religious lessons 
 as well. A school day lasts about 6   
 hours and is very tiring.             </content>
