		<title>01Dyfi Valley At Cemmaes Road</title>
		<content> Influenced greatly by the river Dyfi  
 the valley runs roughly east to west. 
 from the floor of the valley the      
 managed grassland rises up to 2000    
 feet.   Scattered round the area are  
 small paintings of trees mostly       
 deciduous.   The village grew up round
 the now closed Railway station &amp; the  
 junction of 2 'A' class roads.   There
 is a very small population served by a
 primary school with a much used       
 community hall, small public house,   
 post office come general store &amp;      
 filling station.   The population is  
 striongly insular &amp; very Welsh        
 although there is a number of retired 
 outsiders in the area.   Employment is
 mostly agriculture with many farms in 
 the district.   The area is famous for
 its Salmon fishing in season but      
 catchs are declining with each year.
