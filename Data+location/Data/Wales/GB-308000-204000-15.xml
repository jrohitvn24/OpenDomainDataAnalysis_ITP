 There were nine streets in 1905.The   
 school was next to the School House.  
 Two classes were held in Noddfa Chapel
 and five in the school.The infants    
 used slates and the older ones had    
 books.In the terraced houses there was
 only cold water and paraffin lamps for
 lighting.Coal fires were used to heat 
 the rooms.The men and boys worked in  
 the pits owned by Guest,Keen and      
 Nettlefold.Women worked on top pit.The
 wages were poor at 30s a week.The pits
 were Fochriw,South Tunnel and Cwm     
 Bargoed.The Newport to Brecon Railway 
 was important because it brought in   
 all supplies.People walked everywhere.
 Dr Davies did his rounds on a horse.  
 People kept pigs and poultry for food.
 Electricity came in 1917.
