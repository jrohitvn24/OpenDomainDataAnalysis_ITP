		<content> Religion and farming go hand-in-hand  
 as the church at  Trellech Grange is  
 situated in a farmyard.  The services 
 are held on the second Sunday of each 
 month at ll o'clock.  The vicar takes 
 the service which lasts an hour.  The 
 congregation sings a hymn, then       
 there's a bible reading and after that
 the people who are confirmed take     
 communion. Next there is another hymn,
 then a reading from the pulpit and    
 prayers.  During the last hymn there  
 is a collection made by the sidesman. 
 In the monks' day Trellech Grange     
 Church was used as a chapel for the   
 Cistercians.  In one year there are   
 roughly l4 services.  About 2O people 
 attend the services on Sunday.
