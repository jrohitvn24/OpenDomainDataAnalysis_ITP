		<content> From{Denbigh}a journey along{Ruthin Rd
 or one of the winding country roads   
 through{Ystrad}and the{Glyn}brings us 
 to where our block ends at the tip of 
{Llanrhaedr village.}A booklet describ-
 -ing a{Nature trail,}which won a prize
 in a County competition was written by
 the Women's Institute.Only part of the
 trail passes through our area but it  
 was well worth investigating.         
  {Llanrhaedr-yng-Ngninmerch}means the 
{holy place by the waterfall in the    
{Hundred of Cynmerch.}The settlement   
 grew up around a{curative well.}The   
 belief in the{healing properties}cont-
 -inued for many centuries during which
{St Dyfnog's well,}a rectangular pool  
 of dressed stone, has been a place of 
{pilgrimage.}Clustering around is all  
 the vegetation which favours damp     
 shaded spots like Dog's mercury,Ivy   
 and Herb Robert.                      </content>
