		<title>14Ships and Jetties.</title>
		<content> There are two limestone quarries in   
 our area,each with its own jetty.     
 Powell Duffryn Quarries have their own
 fleet,called the Gem Line,named after 
 precious stones.Ships come from N.Ire-
 land and the U.K. coast.The company   
 was started by Robertson's of Robert- 
 son's Research.Working on the jetty   
 are loaders and unloaders.These are   
 skilled jobs as they must know the sea
 movements well.Ships need a draught of
 19' to come alongside.                
     A.R.C.Rayne's Quarry has one ship,
 the Sand Skua,which takes all grades  
 of limestone to Germany,Norway,Sweden 
 and N.Europe.This ship makes about 6  
 calls a week,with foreign ships call- 
 ing about twice a week.Three loaders  
 work this jetty,which has been open   
 18 months,and replaced the previous   
 jetty,which was 84 years old.
