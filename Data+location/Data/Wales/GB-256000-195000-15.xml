		<title>15The annual carnival.</title>
		<content> Loughor carnival started in 1965,it   
 celebrated its'twentieth birthday this
 year.The carnival is organised by the 
 local churches and the proceeds are   
 shared equally between St Pauls,St    
 Davids and St Michaels.It is always   
 held on the first Saturday in June.One
 of the most important jobs is to      
 choose the carnival queens.They do    
 this by holding two dances in the     
 village,the first to choose the Fairy 
 Queen and the second to choose the    
 Rose Queen,they also choose six       
 attendants for each Queen.            
    On the day of the carnival the     
 floats move in a planned route and    
 then return to the grounds were the   
 Queens are crowned.After counting the 
 money an equal amount is shared       
 between the churches that arranged the
 carnival.Carnival day is one of the   
 best days of the year in our area.    </content>
