		<title>10TONMAWR - HOUSING</title>
		<content> Most of the houses are stone built    
 terraced houses, owner-occupied. The  
 houses are addressed by the name of   
 the row they are in: John Terrace,    
 Abergwernffrwd Row, etc .The stone was
 quarried locally. Some of the houses, 
 those built on a steep slope, have    
 three storeys. A lot of householders  
 have hidden the sandstone blocks under
 a layer of pebble-dashed cement. A    
 small number of two storey council    
 maisonettes have been built. A small  
 number of semi-detatched dwellings    
 have been built by their owners within
 the last few years.                   
 All this contrasts with Danycoed,     
 further down the valley, which is     
 entirely a council-housing estate.
