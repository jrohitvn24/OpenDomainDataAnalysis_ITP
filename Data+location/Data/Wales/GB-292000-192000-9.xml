		<title>09A UNEMPLOYED PERSON'S DAY</title>
		<content> I FINISHED SCHOOL THREE YEARS AGO AND 
 HAVE NOT HAD A PROPER JOB SINCE.  AT  
 THE MOMENT I AM ON THE DOLE, WHICH I  
 GET EVERY THURSDAY.  WHEN I LEFT      
 SCHOOL I WENT ON SOME OF THE          
 GOVERNMENT TRAINING SCHEMES, BUT WHEN 
 YOU FINISH THESE THERE ARE NO JOBS TO 
 GO TO.  THERE ARE NO JOBS IN THE AREA,
 ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PIT CLOSED IN    
 1983.  I NORMALLY GET UP LATE, USUALLY
 ABOUT DINNER TIME.  AFTER DINNER I GO 
 DOWN THE CAFE WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS 
 WHO ARE ALSO ON THE DOLE.  IN THE CAFE
 WE TALK AND PLAY ON THE SPACE         
 INVADERS.  THE DAYS ARE BORING REALLY 
 BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING TO DO AND I  
 HAVE LITTLE MONEY TO SPEND.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
