		<content> Mr Phillips is secretary of the       
 Baptist Chapel and knows everyone in  
 the locality.The majority of the      
 houses and farms are scattered except 
 for about ten houses clustered around 
 'The Brigdend Inn' and Post Office and
 a similar number at the Fishguard end 
 of the area.                          
 Mr Pillips was happy that some of the 
 newcomers joined the community in     
 it's language and culture but         
 unfortunately some did not.It saddened
 him that people moving into the area  
 could afford to pay higher prices than
 the local people for farmland and that
 young people had to leave their homes 
 to seek employment elsewhere.
