		<title>02Garway School</title>
		<content> There has been a school in Garway     
 since 1875. The old school building is
 just up the road from the present     
 school, which was built in 1962. The  
 school population has varied from over
 120 to the present 32. At 11, children
 transfer to Kingstone, or sometimes   
 Ross-on-Wye. Very few children live   
 near the school, and currently only   
 one walks to school. The rest come by 
 car or on the school bus. Only 12     
 pupils live within our block. The     
 school has two classrooms, a hall and 
 a resources area (which used to be the
 kitchens - school dinners are now     
 brought by car from St. Weonards). We 
 have a good playing field and a small 
 swimming pool. There are two teachers,
 a part-time secretary, and a cleaner. 
 This survey has been completed by a   
 class of 20 7-11-year-olds, of whom   
 only 6 are upper juniors.             </content>
