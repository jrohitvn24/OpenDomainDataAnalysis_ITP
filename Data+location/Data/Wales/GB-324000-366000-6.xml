		<content> The calves are all kept in different  
 barns around the farm.Some were in    
 groups others were separated.Later on 
 when the calves that are to be kept   
 for milking are a bit older they will 
 have their horns burnt off.This is so 
 that when the cows fight they don't   
 injure each other.The vet is called   
 out to the farm about every two and a 
 half months on average.The last time  
 he was called out was for a calf which
 had broken its legs by jumping through
 a door.There are seven workers on the 
 farm.Their day starts at 6.am and     
 finishes at 5.30.pm. The busiest time 
 on the farm for them  is July because 
 that is the harvesting time for the   
 silage which is used as fodder during 
 the winter months when outdoor grazing
 is not possible.
