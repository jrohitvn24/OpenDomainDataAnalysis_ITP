 village of Llangadog every other      
 Tuesday.The mart is for the sale of   
 sheep and lambs except for the Xmas

 The mart ground is between the Red    
 Lion Hotel and Rhydyfro Council       
 Housing Estate.Repair work is being   
 done at the present time at the mart  
 ground with new gates and fences being
 erected.The number of sheep and lambs 
 at the mart varies from about 700 to  
 1,500.The animals are weighed on      
 arrival and then placed in pens until 
 the auction starts at 11.00 a.m. The  
 auctioneer is from Llandovery,a town 6
 miles from Llangadog.Many farmers in  
 the area bring their animals to the
