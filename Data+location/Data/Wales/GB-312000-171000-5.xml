		<title>05Earthworks At Cwm George</title>
		<content> The history of the earthworks begins  
 in the Iron Age Period, 5000 years    
 ago.   It was lightly fortified and   
 consisted of an enclosure in a bluff, 
 this being situated on a steep hill   
 surrounded by four sets of inner banks
 and two sets of uncompleted outer     
 banks.   In the 1940s Mortimer Wheeler
 spent 4 years digging at the site and 
 found that the main occupation was in 
 the Dark Ages.   Evidence suggests it 
 was lightly defended in this period   
 and the occupants led a cultured life,
 as manifest in their use of wine and  
 olive oil.   In the enclosure remains 
 have been found of two buildings,     
 possibly a great hall and a barn.     
 During the 1100s the site was occupied
 by the Normans and was later occupied 
 in Cromwell's time.   The last owner  
 was Iestyn Ap Gwrgan.
