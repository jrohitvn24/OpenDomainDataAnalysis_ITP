		<content> The area lies within the valley of    
 the R.USK which here is flowing east- 
 wards towards Brecon.The valley floor 
 is quite narrow, seldom exceeding 500 
 metres.  The sides of the valley      
 generally rise gently with no steep   
 slopes excepting along the river banks
 in some places.The floor of the valley
 lies at about 180 metres above sea-   
 level.  North of the river the land   
 rises to about 300 metres. Two import-
 ant tributaries of the R.Usk flow into
 it within this area; the Afon Senni   
 which flows northwards from the higher
 montains of the Brecon Beacons and the
 Afon Cilenni which drains the upland  
 of MYNYDD EPPYNT and flows into the   
 Usk from the north-west.  Part of the 
 area lies within the BRECON BEACONS   
 NATIONAL PARK.The northern boundary of
 the Park follows a minor road north of
 the river.                            </content>
