		<content> The most populated area is situated   
 near the town centre with the villages
 of Greenfield,Brynford,Carmel and Pant
 Asaph surrounding it.Within the area  
 there are{several farms}but these are 
 mainly{family concerns}and apart from 
 a few which have youngsters on job    
 creation,are not sources of employ-   
 ment.The farms are{mainly sheep and   
{stock}with a few dairy farmers who    
 deliver milk daily to homes and a     
{little arable}farming. A few years ago
 Holywell was a thriving market town   
 with many animals wandering around the
 street on Monday market days and farm-
 ing families busily shopping for their
 weekly supplies.This market has now   
 closed and all the pens have vanished.
 There is still an outdoor and indoor  
 market with travelling salesmen set-  
 ting up stalls Thursdays to Saturdays 
 and a WI stall on Fridays.            </content>
