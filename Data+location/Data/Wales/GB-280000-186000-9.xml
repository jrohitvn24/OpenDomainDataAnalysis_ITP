		<content> The church comprises six of the       
 eight bays of the former Cistercian   
 Abbey founded in 1147.  Greatly       
 restored between 1805 - 1809 the      
 interior furnishings are largely the  
 gifts of the Talbot family who are    
 buried here as are their Mansel       
 ancestors.                            
 In the first major restoration of     
 recent years the east end and west    
 front have been made safe, the church 
 re-roofed, the south aisle windows    
 replaced and new oak doors installed  
 in the west front.  Approximately 100 
 parishioners attend the three Sunday  
 services.  Only a few children attend 
 the Sunday school.  A Community       
 service programme provides manual     
 labour to clean up the once overgrown 
 churchyard.  Within Margam Park the   
 Abbey ruins including the unique      
 Chapter house are being restored.     </content>
