		<content>  In this area there are 11 churches &amp; 
 chapels which hold weekly services.   
  Sunday school is held,but not many   
 children and parents attend. Many     
 children do go to church, but the     
 vicar would like more.                
  In 1984 one church dealt with 30     
 deaths,33 baptisms &amp; 16 weddings.The  
 church holds two holy communions a    
 week.They are held on Sunday evenings.
  The churches &amp; chapels have special  
 services like Lent,Easter,Anniversary 
 Gift Day,Christingle,Harvest and Youth
 services.                             
  About 20 people go to choir practice 
 a week.The churches have outings in   
 the summer holidays.                  
  At some chapels they hold Christmas  
 parties and youth clubs.
