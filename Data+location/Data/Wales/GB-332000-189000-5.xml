 school.These include chess,football,  
 netball,cricket,running,athletics,    
 music,and safe cycling.               
                       We have two     
 music teachers who come in for short  
 periods to teach the violin and       
 clarinet to children who are          
 interested.Most chidren stay at school
 during the lunch break.School dinners 
 are 55p each but many children have   
 them free as they come from           
 "low-income" families.
