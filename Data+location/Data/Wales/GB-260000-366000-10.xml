         ______________                
 We play a lot of games in school but  
 the most popular is football.All the  
 boys play football and we have a team 
 that plays in the junior schools      
 league.The girls play Netball and     
 hockey.A new game we play is short    
 tennis which you play with a softball 
 and plastic rackets.                  
                     During the Winter 
 months we play mini-rugby which is    
 another new game for us.Rugby used to 
 be played by clubs in South Wales     
 only,but now we have our own rugby    
 club in Bethesda.Once a year we play  
 "conkers"when we climb chesnut trees  
 to find the best conkers.We also play 
 marbles,but it is a craze thatnever   
 lasts long.The girls play HOPSCOTCH on
 the yard and sing songs when they play
 ball.                                 </content>
