		<content> The high ground in the west of the    
 area, rising to over 500m, forms part 
 of the Clwydian Hills and is underlain
 by slaty-shales of Silurian age.      
 The hillsides are steep but not rocky.
 Much of the higher land is moorland or
 rough-grazing; some land has been used
 for forestry and some reclaimed to    
 provide better sheep-grazing.The east-
 ern part of the area is underlain by  
 Carboniferous Limestone, which forms a
 steep scarp, with rocky outcrops in   
 places, on the east side of the River 
 Alyn. Most steeper slopes are wooded: 
 the flatter land of the valley is     
 mainly hedged fields of grass.        
 The unspoilt nature of the scenic     
 countryside here has recently led the 
 Countryside Commission to designate   
 the whole of the Clwydian Hills       
 (including most this area) as an 'Area
 of Outstanding Natural Beauty'.       </content>
