 Traffic has been growing steadily over
 the years along the North Wales Coast.
 Now a new road has been built which is
 part of the ColCon(Colwyn Bay-Conwy)  
 Project.This means that the mainstream
 traffic no longer has to go through   
 the middle of Colwyn Bay and Mochdre. 
{Attitudes.}                           
 There have been many fears about the  
 new expressway since its early        
 planning days.Some people were against
 it being built at all fearing the     
 adverse effect such a road might have 
 on the shopping centre.However the    
 road was built and the final stretch  
 was opened on Saturday 29th June 1985.
 The people of Mochdre believe it will 
 be a good thing on the whole as it    
 will make the village a quieter and   
 safer place.Village traders do not    
 feel they will loose much trade.      </content>
