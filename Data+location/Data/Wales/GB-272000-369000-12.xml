		<title>12Landscape in Caerhun Parish</title>
		<content> The landscape of this area is centred 
 around the valley of the River Ro. Its
 source is in the west of the area in  
 open hillside. Giant electricity      
 pylons are a striking feature on the  
 higher ground. Whitewashed or grey    
 stone cottages are scattered on the   
 slopes. In the middle part of the     
 valley the river flows through steeply
 wooded banks. On either side there are
 fields used mainly for pasture        
 enclosed by dry-stone walls. Lower    
 down, the valley opens out as it joins
 the wider valley of the River Conwy of
 which the Ro is a tributary. The      
 village of Rowen is built along the   
 west bank of the Ro. The highest point
 is in the south-west of the area, near
 Pen y Castell, at 1950 feet and the   
 lowest point, in the Conwy valley, is 
 250 feet above sea level.
