		<content> I go to the{youth club}and it is very 
 good for all ages.Round about thirty  
 children go and they think it is very 
 good.I enjoy them every time it comes.
 It is always the fourth{Thursday}at   
 the end of the month,half past six to 
 8 o'clock is the time that it starts  
 and finishes.We take{games}and play   
 with them for about an hour.Then the  
 older ones go out and play games like 
 football and cricket on the field,    
 while the younger ones stay in and    
 have a{story}and then draw about it.  
 Different people take us every month. 
 It costs 10p to get in.The Church     
 Choir also practises their hymns for  
 their Family Service in Church.I      
 have not missed a meeting of the Youth
 club.
