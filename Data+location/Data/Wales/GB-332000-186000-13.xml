		<content>     {Newport County Football Club}is  
 currently in the Third Division of the
 Football league.                      
                                       
     {Somerton Park,}the home of the   
 club was once used by a Speedway Team 
 and the track is still running around 
 the perimeter of the ground.          
                                       
      Due to the clubs financial       
 troubles the ground has fallen into   
 decay over the last few seasons, and  
 last year the club was threatened with
 bankruptcy.                           
                                       
      Now however the club's future is 
 more promising and we are hopeful that
 the 1985/86 season will be very       
 successful.
