		<content> area.                                 
     Near Drysgeirch Mill there was a  
 woolen factory.                       
     Gelly-Gatrog Farm is believed to  
 date back to Elizabethan times.       
     The present house of Ffrwd is the 
 third house on this site.  There is a 
 wall still standing of the first house
 where a tudor rose is depicted on the 
 plaster.                              
     Pontantwn at one time was a       
 thriving village with a smithy, post  
 office, taylor's shop, public house,  
 mills etc., but at present it is      
 mainly residential.                   
     A toll gate was burnt in this area
 during the Rebecca riots.  It is      
 believed that one of the leaders lived
 nearby.
