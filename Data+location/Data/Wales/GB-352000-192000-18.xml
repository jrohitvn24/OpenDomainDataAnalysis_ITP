		<title>18Local History. The Castle</title>
		<content> The castle has been run by government 
 departments since 1953,previously     
 privately owned.11 people are         
 employed at the Castle.The head       
 custodian has been working there for 9
 years.It is busy,but enjoyable work   
 and she is proud of her job.It is     
 Britain's first stone built Norman    
 castle,dating back to 1067.Every year 
 approx. 5,000 people visit the castle,
 mostly in the summer months.This      
 summer one of the scenes from Robin of
 Sherwood was filmed at the castle.The 
 custodian said that everything looked 
 spectacular and she enjoyed every     
 minute of it,although she didn't get a
 part.She believes that the castle is  
 Chepstow's history and without it     
 Chepstow would be a dead town with no 
 places of interest.
