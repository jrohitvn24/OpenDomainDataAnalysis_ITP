		<title>05HEALTH-RIDING FOR DISABLED</title>
		<content>   The R.D.A. is an association which  
 helps disabled people to learn how to 
 ride horses. In Coity there is a group
 which is run by Mrs. Ladbrooke at Long
 Acre Farm. The age range from nine up 
 to twenty two. They own 8 ponies and  
 56 acres of land and have 8 unpaid    
 helpers.                              
   56 disabled people come to the      
 riding school a week. Their lessons   
 last an hour. Some people are able to 
 get on the horse by themselves, others
 have to be lifted on. The R.D.A. get  
 money by raffles, or people give them 
 money from jumble sales etc.          
   Rags, the Blue Peter pony is ridden 
 by everyone. The R.D.A. school is open
 all year round. Once a year six young 
 handicapped people have a week's      
 holiday at the riding school.
