		<title>19LORRIES IN AN OLD TOWN</title>
		<content> Lorries pass through the roads of{Usk 
 many times a day.Recently a  campiagn}
 has been set up to stop lorries       
 coming through{Usk.}The main hauliers 
 are{ICI}whose lorries pass through    
 all of the time with big loads. We did
 a survey on shopping in{Usk}and the   
 lorries caused us a lot of trouble as 
 when they passed the noise was        
 deafening so we had to shout to make  
 ourselves heard.                      
  The {town council}have carried out a 
 test to show that it wouldn't cost    
 much to ban large lorries from {Usk.  
{   }They hope that the temporary ban  
 that once existed will soon be        
 reinstated and so improve the{safety  
{of people in Usk.}                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
