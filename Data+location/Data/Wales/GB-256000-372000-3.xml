		<title>03The Pier.</title>
		<content>      The pier, designed by John James 
 Webster and built in 1896 by a        
 Mr.Thorne, both from London, is now in
 the process of reconstruction. The    
 original purpose was as a landing     
 stage for large boats from Liverpool. 
 Passengers could then walk ashore     
 unlike previously when they had to    
 rely on a small boat to carry them    
 across the shallow water. The pier    
 cost nearer{Â£40,000}than the estimated
{Â£17,000}because it was originally     
 designed 200 feet too short to reach  
 deep water. It measures 1,550 feet    
 long and 24 feet wide wideing out to  
 55 feet at the pierhead.              
      The structure was closed in 1971 
 because of metal erosion. Bangor{City 
{Council}bought it from the{County     
{Council}for 1d and with grants,       
 donations and sponsorship are nearing 
 completion of the reconstruction.     </content>
