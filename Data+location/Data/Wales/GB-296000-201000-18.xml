		<title>18St.Johns Church</title>
		<content> St.Johns church was built in 1189.It's
 first record dates back to 1735.When  
 it was first built the roof was made  
 of parchment and the walls were made  
 of rough stone,but now the walls are  
 smooth and the roof is beautiful.     
    The congregation of St.Johns is 100
 people and has not risen since 1980,  
 but it used to seat 176 people.The    
 church was in need of restoration and 
 a vicar raised Â£900 to do so.The      
 church bell that calls the people to  
 church has been there since 1637 and  
 was presented by William Matthew,     
 Squire of Glamorgan,who is now buried 
 with his family in the graveyard.Up to
 1643 people were buried under the     
 church floor.In 1972 when the church  
 was having a new floor the builders   
 found the remains of Mary Rees.
