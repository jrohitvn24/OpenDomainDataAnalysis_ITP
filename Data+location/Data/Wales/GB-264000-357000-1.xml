		<content> This is a classic site for the study  
 of geological, botanical and physical 
 features of a mountain environment.   
 It is the product of glacial activity,
 with cwms, corrie lakes, arretes and  
 moranic deposits.  Heights vary       
 between 1,100 and 2,200 feet, with    
 precipitous slopes.  The landscape    
 also results from the underlying      
 geology, mainly ordouician and        
 silurian volcanics with shales, slates
 and grits.  The main south facing     
 slope is slightly less steep; Fescue  
 Sward dominates.  Elsewhere heather   
 grows on acid soils, and the summits  
 are covered with still developing rock
 detritus.  The area supports hardy    
 sheep and a flock of feral goats;     
 Arctic-Alpine flora survives.         
 Entirely within the Snowdonia National
 Park, approximately two-thirds is a   
 national nature reserve.  As such,    </content>
