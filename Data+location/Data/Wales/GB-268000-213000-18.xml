		<content> There are eight chapels and churches  
 in our block.  The represent most     
 denominations with only two being of  
 the same denomination.                
 The main difference we have found     
 between the one church in the block   
 and the chapels is that the church    
 holds a weekly communion service and  
 chapels hold such a service once a    
 month.  A local{tradition}we have     
 found within the chapels is annual    
 Eisteddfod.  Each chapel competes     
 against the rest in singing, literary 
 and craft competitions.  This plays a 
 major part in the social life of the  
 local chapels.Almost all the religious
 services held within the churches and 
 chapels in the block are held through 
 the medium of{Welsh.}Most religious   
 establishments also hold weekly social
 group meetings e.g. Sisterhood.
