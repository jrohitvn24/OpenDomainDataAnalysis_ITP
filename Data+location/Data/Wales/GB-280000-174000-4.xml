		<content> As with other areas in Great Britain, 
 Porthcawl can boast of excellent      
 educational facilities.They are       
 however all in other corresponding    
 rectangles.                           
 The first state education school in   
 Porthcawl was opened in 1873 at the   
 cost of Â£500.It was housed in Lias    
 Road and was called Porthcawl National
 School.The discipline in the school   
 was very strict,both for staff and    
 pupils.It was originally a church and 
 was therefore built in the shape of a 
 cross.Many people living in Porthcawl 
 remember the imposing building and    
 looking back probably wonder how it   
 turned out such good pupils.          
 The school was eventually closed in   
 1952 and soon after was demolished.It 
 is now the site of a supermarket.
