 THE LOCAL FARMING HAS UNTIL RECENTLY  
 BEEN MIXED WITH A PREDOMINANCE OF     
 DAIRY FARMING. THIS HAS DRASTICALLY   
 CHANGED SINCE THE MILK QUOTA          
 REALLOCATION OF 1984. MORE POTATOES   
 ARE NOW GROWN AS WELL AS MORE BEEF    
 STOCK REARING. GOATS AND SHEEP ARE    
 ALSO MORE NUMEROUS.                   
 MOST OF THE FARMS ARE SMALL, WITH 180 
 ACRES BEING THE LARGEST AS OF NOW.    
 SADLY, ONE FARM IS NOW FOR SALE DUE TO
 LIQUIDATION, WHILST ONE MORE IS       
 PRECARIOUSLY SITUATED. THE WET SUMMER 
 HAS ACCENTUATED THE DIFFICULTIES...   
 HOWEVER, THE LAND IS GOOD AND THE AREA
 SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROSPER ONCE THE   
 PRESENT ECONOMIC PLIGHT  LESSENS.     
 THE AREA WILL CONTINUE TO BE MAINLY   
 AGRICULTURAL.
