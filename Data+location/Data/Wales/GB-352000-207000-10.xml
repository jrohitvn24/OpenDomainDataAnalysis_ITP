		<title>10LOWER REDBROOK: CHANGES</title>
		<content> Today the only public transport is by 
{bus,}a return service from{Monmouth}to
{Chepstow.}On Tuesdays there is a free 
 bus from{Redbrook}to{Carrefour Hyper- 
{market}and back.In 1945 the{Red and   
{White}bus company ran services between
{Monmouth}and{Chepstow,}and the{Bristol
{Omnibus Co.}between{Coleford}and {    
{Monmouth,}via{Redbrook.}Trains ran    
 from{Monmouth}to {Chepstow,}stopping  
 at{Redbrook Railway Station.}The      
 trains carried freight as well as     
 passengers, including coal and iron   
 for the tinplate works.The line is now
 dismantled and the station knocked    
 down. The school caretaker's garden is
 where the station was and you can walk
 where the line was. There were fewer  
 car owners than today and less        
 vehicles on the road. People could    
 cross the river by{ferry-boat}but now 
 the only crossing is by{footbridge.  }</content>
