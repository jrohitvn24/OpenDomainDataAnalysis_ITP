		<title>20BARGOED MARKET</title>
		<content> An open-air market of about 50 stalls 
 has been in operation on the Hanbury  
 Road Car Park since 1977. Market Day  
 is Thursday as this used to be the    
 quietest business day in town. The    
 market has succeeded in attracting    
 many people to the town, thus making  
 Thursday one of the busiest days for  
 traders. The effect of the market has 
 been to attract people from as far as 
 Rhymney in the north and Caerphilly   
 and Llanbradach in the south. Local   
 businesses have benefitted from the   
 establishment of the market, as people
 coming to the market will inevitably  
 visit other shops in town as well.    
 However some people have complained   
 that although the market has been     
 generally beneficial to traders, some 
 have suffered from its presence e.g.  
 the closure of Liptons food-store.
