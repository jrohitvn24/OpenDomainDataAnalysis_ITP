 unusual in our area because there is a
 lot of unemployment.My mother works in
 Prince Charles Hospital,Merthyr Tydfil
 a large modern building where over a  
 1000 people work.It is used by the    
 people of Merthyr and of the nearby   
 Rhymney valley so about 140,000 people
 rely on it.My mother works there full 
 time.She starts at 8.30.a.m.and       
 finishes at 4.30.She deals with       
 applications for nurse training in all
 the hospitals in Mid. Glamorgan.She   
 has worked there for 7 years and likes
 it.My father works in a company that  
 makes axles and gears for the motor   
 industry.He is a machine operator and
