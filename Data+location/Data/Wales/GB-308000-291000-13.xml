		<content> Nicholas's house.                     
 My house is on a hill on the edge of  
 town.It is part of a terrace.There is 
 a good view of the town from the front
 of the house.The house is made of red 
 brick &amp; has a slate roof.In front is  
 a small garden with grass &amp; flowers.It
 is about 80 years old.Inside the front
 door there is a long passage.On one   
 side,to the left,there is a big       
 sitting room.At the end of the passage
 is the living room.Beyond that there  
 is a kitchen,pantry and a small room  
 for the washing machine.Upstairs there
 are four bedrooms.The biggest bedroom 
 is used as a playroom &amp; has a snooker 
 table in it.On this floor is also a   
 bathroom &amp; another little room.In the 
 basement there is a cellar.The house  
 is heated by gas central_heating.
