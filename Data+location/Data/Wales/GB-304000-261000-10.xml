		<content>   Most farmers have sheep and cattle  
 in this area.Sheep lamb in spring.    
   Farmers usually dip twice a year but
 they can dip three times a year.Most  
 farmers buy cattle at a young age and 
 sell at 10 to 12 months old.They are  
 usually all sold at local markets     
 around Powys but they might be sold in
 Hereford.                             
    In the summer farmers let the grass
 grow long and in winter they keep the 
 grass as hay when it is in bales or   
 silage.                               
     There is about 2.5 acres to a     
 hectare.                              
     Some people with farms have horses
 although not many have shire          
 horses around this area.              
      The main two tractors are "David 
 Brown" and "Ferguson".
