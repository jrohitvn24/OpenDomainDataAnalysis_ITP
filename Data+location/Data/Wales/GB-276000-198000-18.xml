		<content>    About a mile away from this farm is
 a smaller farm called Lletty Bella.   
 This farm is about{150 years old}and  
 is also a quiet place,being situated  
 far from the main roads. The farmer   
 says he is{self-sufficient}and he can 
 supply almost anything which he and   
 his family needs - and we believe him!
 The house in the orchard behind this  
 farm has recently been sold to a      
 family from England.                  
    One of the most interesting houses 
 in our area was once an{old Tithe     
{Barn,}which has now been converted    
 into a house. The barn itself was{400 
{years old}and it was rebuilt as a     
 house 20 years ago.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
