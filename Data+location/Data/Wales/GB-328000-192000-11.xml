		<title>11    A Cwmbran Farm</title>
		<content>    Pentre-basket is a small 55 acre   
 grazing farm. When Mr Price came there
 were just a few cotttages beside the  
 canal. Now his farm is surrounded by  
 the developing Hollybush Housing      
 Estate, Ty-Coch Industrial site,a     
 rubbish tip and Cwmbran Drive which is
 to be extended across one of his main 
 hay fields.                           
    Newcomers, unfamiliar with rural   
 ways often trespass causing damage to 
 fences and crops. A once thriving     
 community has declined. Mr Price is   
 one of the few remaining farmers but  
 slowly and surely his farm is being   
 squeezed out by industrial development
