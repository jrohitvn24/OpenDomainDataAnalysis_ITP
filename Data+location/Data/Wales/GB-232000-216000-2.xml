		<content> In our area we have a few historic    
 remains.One is a cromlech and it is   
 about 3,500 years old.Three supporters
 still stand erect but the capstone has
 slipped.it measures 8 by 7 and is     
 2"thick.In the field to the north of  
 the cromlech is a fine flat stone     
 called Bwrdd Arthur.The next historic 
 remain is an iron age hillfort and it 
 is a fairly perfect enclosure with a  
 ditch.To the south west stands what   
 appears to be the remains of an       
 annex.The entrance is also in the     
 south west corner.At Bryn Cywyn is a  
 rectangular enclosure of almost a     
 quarter of an acre with a simple      
 entrance on the eastern               
 bank,surrounded by a continuous ditch 
 of iron age or Roman period.
