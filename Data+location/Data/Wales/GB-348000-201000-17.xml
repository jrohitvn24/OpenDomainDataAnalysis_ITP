		<content> Thirty nine people replied to our     
 questionnaire on employment and       
 lifestyles. 88% had lived in Catbrook 
 less than l5 years and 33% less than  
 five years.  Only l2% had lived here  
 more than l5 years.  A third of those 
 interviewed had moved from the        
 south-east, and a quarter have moved  
 from the local area. The remainder    
 were North East 2% North West 2% Wales
 3% West Country l4% and Midlands 2O%. 
 Four workers are based at home, along 
 with l2 housewives.  The remaining 23 
 travel to work everyday.  Of these ten
 travel over 3O miles each day and five
 over ten miles.  This illustrates the 
 development of this area as a commuter
 belt.  Six individuals work for local 
 authorities, five are self employed,  
 five are managers and others range    
 from a University professor to service
 engineers.                            </content>
