		<title>16DAIRY FARMING,PEMBROKE.</title>
		<content>                                       
 Many farmers to the south of{Pembroke}
 are dairy farmers.                    
  If a farmer keeps a herd of dairy    
 cows to produce milk,the cows get     
 nearly all the food they need during  
 the summer by grazing the grass       
 pastures.                             
  Some of the grass is made into hay or
 silage to provide the cows with food  
 during the winter,when it is too cold 
 for the grass to grow.The cows are    
 then kept indoors in a large yard with
 a covered roof.Straw is used for      
 bedding and the straw and dung are    
 then used to manure the fields that   
 are to grow root crops.The waste      
 products of the farm are used in this 
 way to help the crops to grow.
