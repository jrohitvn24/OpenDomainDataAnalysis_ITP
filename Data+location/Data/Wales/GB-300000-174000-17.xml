		<title>17FARMING _ PROBLEMS</title>
		<content> Potatoes are the main cash crop,      
 although expensive to cultivate as    
 they are labour intensive and the soil
 has to be fertilised. After harvesting
 the potatoes have to be sorted by hand
 before selling. Farmers face problems 
 with potatoes such as drought and     
 blight.                               
   The soil in the Vale consists mainly
 of broken down limestone. This causes 
 it to be a strong alkaline soil and it
 has to be neutralised by the farmer.  
 It is usually done with special       
 machinery that can cope with the "up  
 and down"landscape of the Vale's      
 farmland.The areas of steep land of   
 the Vale have lead to the reclamation 
 of undergrowth and wooded areas. This 
 expensive process is contracted out   
 and the land is sown with Italian     
 rye grass for two years.
