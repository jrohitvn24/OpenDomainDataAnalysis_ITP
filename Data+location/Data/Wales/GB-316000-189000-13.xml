		<title>13Buildings-The 'Stute'</title>
		<content>  Nine Mile Point Miners' Institute,   
 built in 1913,is the largest building 
 in Cwmfelinfach.For many years it was 
 the place where miners and their      
 families went for relaxation,entertain
 -ment,and education.The locally       
 quarried sandstone building is very   
 imposing.I remember playing snooker,  
 pool,watching pantomimes and concerts,
 and playing on 'Space Invaders' there.
 But it became too expensive to run so 
 downstairs its many rooms were rented 
 to Sports Fix for manufacturing and   
 storage.Upstairs is the concert hall, 
 the seats torn and soaking from leaks.
 Above the balcony is a dingy          
 projection room,the equipment is there
 but lies obsolete.In the basement     
 Pinkhouse Electronics occupy the      
 swimming pool-now all cracked and     
 boarded over.With so little in the    
 village the 'Stute' needs restoring.  </content>
