		<content> Work began on extending St. Kingsmark 
 school in 1982.The school will be     
 completed by July 1986.On average     
 there will be 70 teachers and between 
 1,000 and 1,100 children in the school
 on completion.The completed school    
 will be called{Chepstow Comprehensive.
 The uniform will be former Kingsmark  
 uniform but the sixth form will have  
 the old Larkfield uniform.The children
 and the teachers are looking forward  
 to being under one roof and sharing   
 the Community centre.There are enough 
 subjects on the time table at present 
 so no more new subjects can be        
 introduced.
