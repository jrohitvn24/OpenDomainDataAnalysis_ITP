		<title>03HOW DENBIGH HAS CHANGED.</title>
		<content>  We interviewed{Miss Purchase,}who was
 about{95}yrs old.She has lived in     
 Denbigh for about{90}yrs.She said,    
 "There's violence on television which 
 shouldn't be shown to children."She   
 thought Denbigh was no tidier and that
 young people are kinder to their      
 elders.She also said the Swimming Pool
 and the High School were not here when
 she came.She also thought that shops  
 have changed considerably with{Timothy
{Whites,Grocery Shops}and{Fish Shops}  
 gone,but the{bus stops}are much the   
 same.She also said that schools don't 
 go to the seaside for trips           
 anymore.She remarked that schools are 
 much nicer and children are less      
 independent now.She went to school    
 when she was{12},and up to then she   
 only knew{2}other girls.              
                                       
                                       </content>
