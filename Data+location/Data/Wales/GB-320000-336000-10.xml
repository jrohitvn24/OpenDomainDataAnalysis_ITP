		<title>10PONTFADOG C.P. SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Pontfadog C.P. school was opened in   
 1908. It is a brick built building,   
 with a wood and rendering facade      
 similar to Tudor architecture.The main
 building has two classrooms,a foyer,  
 toilets, stockroom and a              
 kitchen.Recently a mobile classroom   
 has been placed on the yard.At present
 there are 58 children in school and   
 three members of staff.Some of the    
 children in the school are Welsh      
 speaking and receive their education  
 through the medium of the Welsh       
 language.As the school is very near   
 the Shropshire border, some children  
 from that county come to the school   
 (which is in the county of Clwyd)for a
 Welsh language education.             
 Because of the rural nature of the    
 area over 40 of the children have to  
 come to school by car, taxi,or        
 mini-bus.                             </content>
