		<title>13BEECHWOOD CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> Beechwood Cricket Club is the village 
 team for Monkswood.We play on a ground
 behind the Beaufort Arms Pub.The      
 ground is rented from the Courage     
 Brewery with money being raised from  
 subscriptions, match levies and social
 functions. The members, approximately 
 40 in number, live within a radius    
 of twenty miles from the ground.      
 Anyone can join, unemployed and junior
 members paying half the subscription  
 fees and half price for teas.         
 The ground is maintained by members   
 working a monthly rota.Completing the 
 rota makes the member eligible to play
 in a match.Two teams are fielded to   
 play a Saturday league,friendly       
 matches and several knockout          
 competitions.During the winter months 
 an indoor league is played at Caldicot
 Leisure Centre.
