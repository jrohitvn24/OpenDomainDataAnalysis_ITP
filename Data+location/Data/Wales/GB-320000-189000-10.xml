		<content>   The major developments of industries
 and settlements occurred between 1850 
 and 1914 - as with many areas of South
 Wales. Large amounts of in-migration  
 occurred, satisfying labour demands in
 the new industries. Since World War 2 
 old industries ( coal mining, stone   
 quarrying, metal making, and metals   
 processing) have declined and even    
 disappeared. There were rapid economic
 and social changes.                   
   Today, various light manufacturing  
 and service industries exist:two steel
 stockholders occupy large sites at    
 Wattsville; Crosskeys has a National  
 Bus depot. A clay brick works is at   
 Danygraig. The old sheds of Risca     
 North pit are now engineering works.  
   The huge Powell Duffryn quarry at   
 Machen, a major employer, sends stone 
 for crushing and tarmac-making to the 
 Adams quarry, Risca.                  </content>
