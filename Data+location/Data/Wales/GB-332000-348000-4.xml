		<content> There were lots of pens for the       
 animals to stay in. The smell wasn't  
 too nice. They have three betting     
 rings which are quite big. There are  
 lots of people who help herd the      
 cows,sheep and pigs into the pens and 
 out into the awaiting lorries. they   
 make sure that all gates are secure   
 before moving the animals. It is very 
 dangerous because big lorries come in 
 and go out quite fast. The sheds and  
 pens where the animals stay are kept  
 very clean. They are also quite big so
 that more than one animal can be kept 
 in them. Farmers from all around come 
 here to try to bid their animals and  
 buy something themselves. Sometimes   
 they sell a cow, sheep or pig and buy 
 a different animal. The whole place is
 very big compared to our normal houses
 and shops.
