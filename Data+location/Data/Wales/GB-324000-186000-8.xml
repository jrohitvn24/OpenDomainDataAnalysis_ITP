		<title>08INDUSTRY IN ROGERSTONE-1</title>
		<content> There has been heavy industry in the  
 area since 1772 when copper rolling   
 mills were built along the River Ebbw 
 at Rogerstone Castle. The site was    
 taken over by a steelworks and since  
 1936 by an aluminium rolling works.   
 This company is the largest employer  
 (1,100 jobs) in the area attracted to 
 the region by Newport Docks, railway  
 access, labour and water supplies.    
 They make household and industrial    
 foil and many components.             
 Rogerstone power station was built in 
 1957, supplied by nearby coalmines +  
 River Ebbw cooling water, but has     
 recently proved inefficient and was   
 closed in 1984.                       
 The region offers 2942 manufacturing  
 jobs and 860 service jobs: the latter 
 include schools, pubs, garages, and   
 shops.                                
                                       </content>
