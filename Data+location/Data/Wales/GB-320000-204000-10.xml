		<content> Besides the Health Centre the area has
 several surgeries and one dentist.    
 For serious accidents people have to  
 be taken to hospital in Abergavenny or
 Newport_both over 12 miles away.      
                                       
 Services connected with the Health    
 Centre also visit schools_ the school 
 nurse,dentist and speech therapist;the
 sheltered housing schemes and some    
 houses with bedridden patients.       
 At present these services are facing  
 cut-backs.The most noticeable to us   
 are the checks carried out at school  
 by the school nurse.                  
                                       
 In general the area is well served by 
 the Health Service but in winter the  
 weather causes some problems with     
 transport to and from hospitals.
