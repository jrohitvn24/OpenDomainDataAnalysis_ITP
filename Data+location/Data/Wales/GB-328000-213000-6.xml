		<title>06Abergavenny's Geography</title>
		<content>The mountains around the town are,Sugar
Loaf(596m),Blorenge(559m),Skirrid Fawr 
(486m),Little Skirrid(270m),Deri(343m).
The Usk flows between  Sugar Loaf and  
Blorenge.The valley was altered by a   
glacier which made it wider and left a 
flat floor.Local rocks are sedimentary 
often sandstone.The summit of Sugar    
Loaf is shaped like a vocanic cone but 
there were never volcanos here.The     
Gavenny is a little stream in a big    
valley which was cut by the River      
Honddu thousands of years ago.The      
Honddu used to flow to the Usk,but     
during glaciation a terminal moraine   
was deposited at Llanfihangel Crucorney
blocking the valley.The Honddu was     
diverted and now the Gavenny flows as a
misfit stream in the valley.Abergavenny
grew up at the confluence of the       
Gavenny and the Usk.
