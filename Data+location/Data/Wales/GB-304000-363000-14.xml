		<title>14Farming in the District</title>
		<content>   The land cover for our block is     
 almost exclusively{intensively managed
{grassland}used for pasture or for     
 cutting as{hay}or{silage;}most of it  
 good{Grade 3}land with areas of{Grade 
{2.}Little wonder then that{Farming is 
{extremely}important in this district. 
   There are nearly{30}farms ranging   
 from 3 tiny{10-12 acre}small holdings 
 to one over{200 acres}the average size
 being between{70-100,}mainly dealing  
 with{dairy/beef cattle, sheep, hay,   
{silage}and a little{cereal crop.}     
 Larger, more economical, holdings have
 replaced many small holdings and some 
 have moved from mixed farming to      
 greater{specialisation in dairy       
 farming. A cause for concern for these
 farmers is the{EEC's Milk Quota System
 implemented in{1984}to cut the milk   
 yield by{9%}as this has put the brakes
 on expansion in this line of work.    </content>
