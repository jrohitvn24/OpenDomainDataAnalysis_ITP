		<content> In Skewen we have 3 churches these are
 St.Mary's, St.John's and All Saint's  
 Church.There are 13 chapels spread    
 around the village.There used to be   
 many more but some have closed due to 
 falling attendances.Some of the       
 chapels conduct their services in the 
 Welsh Language.The Different chapels  
 have different denominations.There are
 Calvinist, Baptist, Independent,      
 Methodist and many more.              
 Also in Skewen we have the Salvation  
 Army which also holds services in     
 their church.                         
 In the area as a whole there are also 
 Catholic Churches.Many of the chapels 
 and churches in the district suffer   
 from the same problems.There seems to 
 be a distinct tendency in most areas  
 to suffer from a lack of attendace    
 which leads to a subsequent lack of   
 funds.                                </content>
