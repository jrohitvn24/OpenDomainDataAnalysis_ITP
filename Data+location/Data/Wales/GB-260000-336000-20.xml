		<title>20CUSTOMS SPRING GALA</title>
		<content> The Spring Gala was held in the       
 playing field in may.  William        
 Tarmey(Jack Duckworth) who acts in    
 Coronation Street, the twice weekly   
 soap on Independent TV came along.    
 There are many interesting things     
 there like Kiddies Castles when small 
 children jump about on an inflated    
 castle. Tombola where people pay 10p  
 for a piece of paper with a no. on    
 with a possibility of winning a prize.
  You could try to win a goldfish, a   
 teddy or a coconut.  There is a disco 
 dancing competition which was won by  
 Karen from our school. She got a      
 record token worth Â£5. There is a     
 lucky dip where you put your hand in a
 box and win a prize.  There is a fun  
 run  for under twelves and over       
 twelves. The under twelves race was   
 won by Dewi Gwynedd from Ysgol Cefn   
 Coch.                                 </content>
