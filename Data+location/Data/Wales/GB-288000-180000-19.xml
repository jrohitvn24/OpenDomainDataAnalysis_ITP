		<content>   Litchard Junior School,Bridgend     
 Railway Station and Newcastle Hill    
 Square have all won Prince of Wales   
 Awards for improving the environment. 
  Litchard Junior School received their
 award in 1980 for the school's Nature 
 Reserve.The project began in 1970 with
 the purchase of a piece of land       
 adjacent to the school playing fields.
 Rubbish was cleared from the area but 
 no clearance of the land took place as
 it was decided to use the natural     
 features present.Deciduous trees and  
 conifers were planted,a pond and ditch
 dug.Careful planning ensured the      
 reserve was aesthetically pleasant as 
 well as a useful outdoor classroom.   
 This reserve also received a Shell    
 Better Britain Award in 1980,coming   
 1st.in Wales and 2nd.in Great Britain.
