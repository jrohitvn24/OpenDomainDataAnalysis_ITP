		<title>12CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS.</title>
		<content>   In our house Christmas is a very    
 lively celebration.  We have a big fir
 tree from the forest and we always    
 decorate it with the same decorations:
 tinsel, baubles, brightly coloured    
 lights which inevitably malfunction,  
 and the fairy on the top.             
   Before we go to bed on Christmas Eve
 we put out a glass of sherry for      
 Father Christmas and a dish of milk   
 for his reindeer. We also hang up a   
 stocking for our presents.            
   We usually have a traditional       
 routine for opening the presents on   
 Christmas morning.  Sometimes they are
 hidden: last year my new bike was in  
 the toilet!                           
   The Christmas dinner is another     
 tradition, with roast turkey, potatoes
 and vegetables, followed by Christmas 
 pudding with lashings of cream.
