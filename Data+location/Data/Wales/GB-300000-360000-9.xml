		<title>09HEDGE SURVEY AT NANTGLYN 1</title>
		<content>    This survey was done by the top    
 class at Nantglyn Junior School.      
    The hedge studied has been part of 
 the landscape for many years.Its 66m. 
 length formed the boundary between a  
 narrow road and the school playing    
 field.                                
    The species of tree observed in the
 hedge were {sycamore(most common)     
{blackthorn  hazel  hawthorn  oak      
{wild rose   elder  ivy. }             
    The age of the hedge was estimated 
 using the formula of Dr.Max Hooper*.  
    Age=(no.of species x 110) + 30years
        (7 x 110)+30 = 800years.       
 This answer of {800years}seems fair   
 since the hedge is the boundary of a  
 road which existed at that time.
