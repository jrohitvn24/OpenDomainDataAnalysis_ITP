		<title>02THE CARNIVAL FLOAT BY K.R.</title>
		<content> Every Whit Monday we have a carnival. 
  It is custom that we all meet the    
 night before and decorate the float.  
 On the way to the meeting the girls   
 pick wild flowers in the castle       
 grounds and the ladies pick           
 branches.Sometimes we have a lorry to 
 dress but usually it is a tractor and 
 trailor.                              
  We put a farm gate on the trailor and
 secured it down.The theme of the float
 this year was "The Whole Damn Family" 
    There was hay strewn all over the  
 trailor and logs to sit on.           
  The morning of the Carnival we meet  
 at Scurtle Farm all dressed in our    
 costumes and then we make our way to  
  Clarbeston Road where the Carnival is
 held.We join up with the other        
 villages and follow the procession    
 which leads to the judging of the     
 floats.Ice-creams all round at the end</content>
