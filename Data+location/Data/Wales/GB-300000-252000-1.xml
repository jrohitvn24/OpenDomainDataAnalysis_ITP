		<title>01CWMBACH AND BUILTH ROAD</title>
		<content> This area is almost totally farmland, 
 grazing for sheep and cattle, The only
 industries are small and based at     
 Builth Road where once there was an   
 important railway junction. The old   
 terraced railway cottages and even the
 station are now attractive modernised 
 dwellings. At Cwmbach Llechrhyd, a    
 mile or two away, is the Victorian    
 Church of St. John's and the Victorian
 Pencerrig Primary School. The River   
 Wye is a dominant feature of this     
 area, flowing through one of the most 
 beautiful, unspoilt valleys in        
 Britain. So tourism and catering for  
 the holiday trade form an important   
 part of the economy of the area. But  
 agriculture is by far the greatest    
 source of employment for men. Local   
 industries are related to the land and
 its management. Many people work in   
 Builth and Llandrindod Wells.         </content>
