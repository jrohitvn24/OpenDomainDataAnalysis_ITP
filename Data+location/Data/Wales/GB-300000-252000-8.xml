		<content> Since 1920 Cwmbach Women's Institute  
 have been meeting in the Iron Room,   
 Cwmbach. We are affiliated to the     
 National Federation with their        
 headquarters in London and locally to 
 the Powys-Radnor Federation. We hold  
 our meetings once a month. Our 17     
 members come from the local community 
 and paid a fee of Â£4 for their        
 membership this year. We have a       
 committee of 8 members but all        
 business decisions are made           
 democratically. This year we have had 
 speakers on a wide range of subjects  
 from Pharmaceutical Antiques to soft- 
 toy making and vetinary work. We enter
 as many federation competitions as we 
 can and did very well with our craft, 
 cookery and floral exhibits at Open   
 Day in Llandrindod this year. We are  
 often surprised that even in a small  
 group we discover so much talent.     </content>
