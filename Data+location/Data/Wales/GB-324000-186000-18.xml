		<title>18FAMILY LIFE IN ROGERSTONE</title>
		<content>The day starts with breakfast which    
consists of a cup of tea,cereal,toast  
and jam.Then I go upstairs and dress. I
leave for school at 8.20AM.            
      After school I go home,change and
often go out to play Subbuteo.This is a
football board game for two players.   
There are eleven men on each side,nets,
a referee,two linesmen and,of course,a 
ball.                                  
    Andrea,my sister,is a tennis       
fanatic.My Mum and Dad are also quite  
sporty.Dad runs and plays squash and   
Mum plays badminton some evenings.     
    My Dad is a headmaster and my Mum  
is a teacher.At 8.05AM they set out and
do not return until 4.30PM.At 4.29PM I 
put the kettle on knowing they'll be   
home soon!
