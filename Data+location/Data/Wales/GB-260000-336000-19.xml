		<content> LOCAL FESTIVAL PENLLANW PORTHMEIRION  
 On May 4 1985 a special festival      
 called Penllanw (Sea &amp; Fun or High    
 Tide) organised by the Urdd was held  
 in Portmeirion. The Urdd is the       
 biggest youth movement in Wales with  
 members from 7 to 30 yrs of age. There
 are competitions and a mini marathon  
 in the Penllanw.  This year was       
 special because it was the tenth      
 anniversary.  There were many fund    
 raising stalls. The money is used to  
 help the Urdd finance two youth camps,
 one on the coast at Llangrannog and   
 the other at Galn llyn on the shores  
 of Bala Lake. at one stall you could  
 get your hair dyed red, white, &amp;      
 green, the Urdd colours. Red          
 represents fellow man, white - Christ,
 and green - Wales.  Folk and pop      
 groups and a choir come to entertain  
 people as they walk about the village.</content>
