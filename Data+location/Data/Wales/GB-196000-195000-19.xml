		<title>19Tourism in Stackpole</title>
		<content>                                       
   For such a scenic area,Stackpole is 
 remarkably untouched by tourism.The   
 local beach,Barafundle,has become     
 noticeably busier during the last ten 
 years and there have been three small 
 developments.                         
 1.The National Trust has renovated    
 some old outbuildings at Stackpole    
 Quay and converted them into holiday  
 cottages.                             
 2.The National Trust has renovated    
 some outbuildings at the Home Farm and
 opened an outward bound centre for    
 primary schools.                      
 3.An independent trust has renovated  
 other outbuildings at the Home Farm   
 and created holiday homes for the     
 disabled.                             
   Three private houses provide bed and
 breakfast accommodation during the    
 summer months.                        </content>
