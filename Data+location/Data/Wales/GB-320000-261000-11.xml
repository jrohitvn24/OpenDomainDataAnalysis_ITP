 PRIVATE TRANSPORT. THERE IS ONE BUS A 
 WEEK TO THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN ON      
 MARKET DAY, BUT NON-FARMING MEMBERS OF
 THE COMMUNITY NEED A CAR TO GET TO    
 THEIR PLACE OF WORK. FARMERS USE      
 CONTRACTORS WITH LARGE TRANSPORTERS TO
 CARRY STOCK TO MARKET, BUT IF THERE   
 ARE FEW ANIMALS FOR SALE THE LAND     
 ROVER AND TRAILER ARE USED. THERE IS A
 PRIVATE ORGANISATION, RADNOR VALLEY

 20P A YEAR. MEMBERSHIP GIVES ACCESS TO
 A BUS TO HEREFORD CITY ONCE A MONTH   
 AND OTHER PLACES OF INTEREST,         
 INCLUDING TRIPS TO THE EUROPEAN       
 CONTINENT AND IRELAND. A BUS FROM THE 
 MIDLANDS TO THE COAST IS AVAILABLE,   
 BUT TO TRAVEL BY TRAIN INCURS A       
 JOURNEY BY CAR OF 27 MILES, 15 MILES  
 OR 12 MILES TO REACH BRITISH RAIL
