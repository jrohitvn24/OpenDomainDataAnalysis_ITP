  In Fireball children stand in a      
 circle and throw a ball to each other.
 In any order if the catcher drops it  
 she has to run around the circle and  
 back to her place before someone dabs 
 the spot where she was standing with  
 the ball.                             
          {Fox And Hounds              
  In Fox And Hounds you choose if you  
 want to be a fox or a hound. The      
 hounds give the foxes time to run away
 then chase after them until they are  
 all caught.                           
            {Ghost Train               
  In Ghost Train the last one to run   
 from a point in the yard to the wall  
 is on it. Everybody else returns to   
 the start. A name is shouted and the  
 named person has to run to the wall   
 without being caught. The caught      
 become catchers until all are caught. </content>
