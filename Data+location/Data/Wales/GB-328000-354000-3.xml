		<content>  David Bannister works full time on   
 his 180 acre farm where he keeps about
 80 Freisian cattle mainly for milk and
 meat .Two fields are used for silage, 
 whilst several acres are kept for     
 growing corn,wheat and potatoes,      
 mostly for sale,but some for use by   
 Mr.Bannister's family.                
  Terry Williams works part_time on his
 8 acre smallholding where he grazes a 
 small number of Ayrshire cattle for   
 milk and meat.he grows no crops but   
 gives over two fields for silage.     
  Both men agree that summer is the    
 busiest time and that the main        
 disadvantages of being a farmer are   
 that the day starts very early and is 
 a long one,that work has to be done in
 all kinds of weather and that the     
 farmer is tied to the farm with little
 time for recreation or to take a      
 proper holiday,making homelife hard.  </content>
