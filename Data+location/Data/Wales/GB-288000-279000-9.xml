		<content>  Most farms in the block are small.   
 Only a few are over 100 acres.        
  Livestock: Sheep by far outnumber any
 other livestock. They are sold as     
 breeding ewes to lowland farms, as fat
 lambs or store lambs. The breeds are  
 various, but mainly cross-bred.       
  Cattle are kept by some farmers.     
 These are mainly suckling cows and    
 young stores. A minority are fattened 
 for killing locally.                  
  Horses are bred by a few farmers as a
 sideline. These are for showing or    
 selling as riding ponies.             
  Only one farmer is engaged in        
 large-scale calf rearing.             
  Silage production is on the increase.
 It suits the climate. High rainfall   
 requires regular applications of lime.
  Shearing, silage and hay making is   
 often done by contractors.
