		<title>15Interview-Mr. O.Davies</title>
		<content>  As a boy Owen Davies went to a       
 private                               
 school held in the ante room of the   
 church hall in Creigiau. The school   
 was started and run by John Willie    
 Evans in 1927. "In the days before the
 1939 war, housewives could do all     
 their shopping from local tradesmen   
 such as the baker, butcher,           
 greengrocer," said Owen. Owen's dad   
 was the local builder, he had his     
 first lorry in 1922 and that was a    
 First World War relic, with solid     
 rubber tyres. The first houses to be  
 built in Creigiau, after the Second   
 World War, were in Railway Terrace and
 Castle Close. Soon after that private 
 houses were erected on the large field
 which is now the recreation grounds.  
 The 1960's saw a large estate being   
 built but  sadly Tregarth house was   
 demolished.                           </content>
