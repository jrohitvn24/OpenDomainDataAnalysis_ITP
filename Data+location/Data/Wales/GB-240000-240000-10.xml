		<title>10LLANDYSUL MEALS ON WHEELS</title>
		<content> This is a social service for certain  
 elderly and disabled residents of the 
 area, to ensure they have at least    
 one cooked meal on most days of the   
 week. The list of people receiving    
 meals and the list of volunteer       
 helpers is arranged  by the local     
 organsier. The meals, in individual   
 containers, are collected from the    
 kitchen at{Aweldeg Residential Home,} 
 transported in a heat retaining box   
 which fits into the boot of a car, and
 delivered to the appropriate people.  
 Special diets can be catered for e.g. 
 diabetics. No meals are delivered at  
 present during Tuesdays or at the     
 weekends. Each meal costs 60p.        
 Members of local chapels, churches and
 local organisations distribute the    
 meals. Twelve people receive the meals
 at present; the service as it stands, 
 could only deal with a few more.      </content>
