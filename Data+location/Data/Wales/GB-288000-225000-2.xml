		<content> The area is composed of sedimentary   
 rocks of Old Red Sandstone (Devonian) 
 age, these being grits and            
 sandstones which are red in colour.   
 The soils are light and acid.  Much   
 of the top of Fforest Fach is covered 
 with peat.                            
 Evidence of Quaternary glaciation is  
 to be found in the two valleys where  
 there are morainic deposits.  There is
 a prominent (but hitherto undescribed)
 terminal moraine in Cwm Treweren at   
 TRE'R-DOMEN  in the North East corner 
 of this area.                         
 The local rocks are well-exposed in a 
 disused quarry located on the eastern 
 slopes of Fforest Fach above Forest   
 Cottage and Pantymaes farm.  It should
 be noted, however, that this is not a 
 place for unsupervised visits and     
 indiscriminate scrambling.
