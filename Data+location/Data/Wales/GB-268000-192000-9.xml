 Today our class went for a walk to the
 top of Kilvey Hill. We took the path  
 that skirted the edge of the Bog and  
 comes out at th back of the hill at   
 Bonymaen. We passed near three farms  
 on our way to the top, farms with     
 cows, chickens and horses. Because of 
 the T.V. mast at the top of the hill, 
 pylons strode like gigantic figures   
 from the edge of the sea to the very  
 summit carrying the electricity needed
 by the installation at the top.       
 We sat and rested at the summit.      
 Stretched below us was Danygraig, the 
 Docks and the sea. Away on our left   
 was the Baglan Bay Petro_Chemical     
 works and Llandarcy Oil Refinery. All 
 of us must have seen the view many    
 times, but none of us had really taken
 it in before.
