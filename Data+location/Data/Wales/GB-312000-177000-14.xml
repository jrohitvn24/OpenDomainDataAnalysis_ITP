		<content> On 21st May, 1985, two excited classes
 came rushing into school. Today they  
 were going on a trip to St Fagans Folk
 Museum. Mr Mantle and Mr Burns, the   
 two classes' teachers had told them to
 bring a packed lunch. They set off at 
 9:45 a.m. and joyfully walked out of  
 the school gates and very quickly     
 ascended to the top of the hill. Then 
 they slowly paraded down hill. At the 
 bottom of the slope they were a few   
 paces away from a water-tower. The    
 two classes ran happily into          
 Coed-Bychan, which was a couple of    
 yards from the water-tower. They saw a
 variety of trees, mostly beech, before
 arriving at St Fagans village. They   
 stopped to view St Mary's Church      
 before approaching the Welsh Folk     
 Museum.
