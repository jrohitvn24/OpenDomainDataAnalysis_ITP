		<title>03Monmouth,a Market Town</title>
		<content> Whilst many towns have lost their     
{markets,}Monmouth still is a centre   
 for the sale of{farm animals.}The     
{auctioneers}Rennie,Taylor,Miles and   
 Escott and Coles,Knapp and Kennedy are
 joint tenants. A market is            
 held every Monday and on the second   
 and last Friday of each month. In     
 addition there are five seasonal{sheep
{sales}held in the Autumn.             
  An average Monday market would       
 consist of 40 fat cattle, between 400 
 and 900 sheep and between 12-20       
 calves.                               
  The Friday sales are for{store cattle
 and on average there would be 200     
 cattle.The seasonal sheep sales       
 would have 3000 ewes 1500 lambing,and 
 70 rams. Recently{trade}decreased due 
 to competition from larger markets.   
 Large wholesalers buy in large        
 quantities - thus an adverse effect.  </content>
