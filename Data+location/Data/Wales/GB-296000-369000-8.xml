		<title>08A FARM VISIT IN WINTER</title>
		<content> This is how{Jenny Pegg,}a five year   
 old pupil described a farm visit.Jenny
 recently moved to the area from       
 Lincolnshire.                         
 On the last day of February we went to
 Tan Llan. First we went to the cowshed
 where we saw one cow that had just    
 calved. Then we went into a barn and  
 we stood in a cubicle and watched Mr  
 Jones clean the barn using the        
 tractor.The cattle were outside eating
 silage but at night they have hay.Miss
 Eirian showed us the silage ,it smelt 
 like toffee and it was damp.She then  
 led us into a sort of shed and showed 
 us what the calves ate. After that we 
 went into a little cowshed and stroked
 a calf.                               
 As we walked back to school we could  
 see the young lambs playing in the    
 field.We also saw the geese but the   
 goslings have not hatched yet.        </content>
