		<title>01Landscape-Vale of Glamorgan</title>
		<content>  Our area is part of the Vale of      
 Glamorgan.The underlying rock is of   
 blue lias limestone,and the land is a 
 fairly flat plain,very close to the   
 sea,with an average height of         
 70m.above sea level.The area is       
 predominantly agricultural.There are  
 20 farms spread throughout the        
 area,and farmland covers over 90% of  
 it.It's mainly covered in grass;for   
 pasture,hay and sileage,and non-grass 
 crops such as barley and potatoes.    
 Animals are chiefly cattle,both dairy 
 and beef,and also sheep.              
  Atlantic College is situated in the  
 area.It is a unique type of sixth form
 college where students from many      
 countries attend.                     
  Apart from this there is very little 
 or no other industry.The area includes
 the tiny villages of St.Donats and    
 Marcross.                             </content>
