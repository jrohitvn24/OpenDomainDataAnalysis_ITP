		<content> The people of the area are represented
 by three County Councillors,5 borough 
 councillors and two community         
 councils.Ruabon has its own community 
 council and Cefn Mawr,Acrefair,       
 Rhosymedre and Newbridge combine to   
 form a 16 strong council.They meet    
 once a month,on Tuesday evening,to    
 discuss general council business.     
 Other meetings are called to discuss  
 finance,burial and lighting.They have 
 been few elections for the council in 
 recent years,due to the lack of       
 opposition.This year,however,there    
 were a number of contested            
 elections.There were a number of local
 issues involved.The most important    
 were the problems caused by the Delph 
 Open Cast Mine and the pollution of   
 the River Dee.Other issues were the   
 proposed open market in Cefn and a    
 country park on the Ty Mawr estate.   </content>
