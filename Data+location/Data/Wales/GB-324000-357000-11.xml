		<title>11Languages in Leeswood area</title>
		<content>                                       
  The use of the Welsh language in     
 the Leeswood area is in decline.Older 
 residents tell us that in the early   
 20th century,Welsh was the most       
 popular language in the home and the  
 chapels, even though it was not taught
 in schools.                           
  Today less than half the population  
 can speak Welsh,even though it is     
 taught in schools.                    
  The reasons for this are thought to  
 include the decline in Sunday School  
 attendance,the influx of many English 
 people into the area,and the influence
 of the English language media,espec-  
 ially television.
