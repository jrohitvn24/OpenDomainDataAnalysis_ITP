		<title>10FARMING, WINTER TACK</title>
		<content> The ewe lambs are moved to lowland or 
 coastal pastures  for the duration    
 of their first and second winters.    
 This practice of transhumance is known
 as "Tacking".   The preferred         
 localities for wintering these hill   
 sheep are the coastal areas of West   
 Wales.   Formerly they were driven to 
 these winter pastures, the journey    
 occupying about a week; later they    
 were taken there by rail from Senny-  
 bridge station.  Today they are moved 
 by road in large two- or three-level  
 trucks.                               
 The breeding ewes winter on the farms 
 and are brought to the lower pastures 
 for easier feeding during winter. Some
 supplementary feeding is almost       
 essential.   Because of the cold,wet  
 springs, lambing does not begin until 
 mid-March and continues through       
 April.                                </content>
