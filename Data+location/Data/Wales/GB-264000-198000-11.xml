		<title>11The D.V.L.C.</title>
		<content>      D.V.L.C. stands for Driver and   
 Vehicle Licensing Centre. It is very  
 important to people who own cars.     
      About Five thousand people are   
 employed at the D.V.L.C. which was    
 opened about fifteen years ago.Their  
 work includes keeping records of all  
 the drivers in the country and issuing
 registration documents and driving    
 licenses. The records are kept on a   
 great big computer so if someone's car
 is stolen the police can check with   
 the computer to find the owner.       
      The D.V.L.C. has sixteen floors  
 and it is one of the tallest buildings
 in Swansea. At night its lights can be
 seen shining brightly for miles       
 around.                               
      When someone begins working at   
 the centre they have to sign a form.  
 When they have signed the form they   
 must not tell anyone about their work </content>
