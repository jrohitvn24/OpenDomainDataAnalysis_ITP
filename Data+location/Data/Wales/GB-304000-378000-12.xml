		<content>  Dyserth and Meliden at one time had  
 their own Railway stations linked to  
 Prestatyn. Both passengers and freight
 were transported along the line,      
 particulary stone and lime from the   
 nearby quarries. The track bed has    
 however been removed since its closure
 in 1980.Plans are in hand to restore  
 the service by the North Clwyd Railway
 Assocation.                           
 Most people today use cars for their  
 own private transport.Those who do not
 own a car make use of the public      
 service, provided by the National     
 Crosville Bus Company which runs      
 regular scheduled services throughout 
 the area.Dyserth does however have its
 own Private Bus Company,Voel Coaches, 
 which provides local,national and     
 foreign trips and holidays.They also  
 take children on school trips and     
 convey pupils to schools in Clwyd.    </content>
