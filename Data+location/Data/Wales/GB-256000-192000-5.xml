		<title>05PRIMARY EDUCATION,DUNVANT</title>
		<content> The school is named Dyfnant Primary   
 School,Dyfnant being the Welsh word   
 for Dunvant.Opened in 1972 to         
 accommodate 240 children,a demountable
 classroom had to be added when the    
 number of children rose to 270.A      
 gradual decline in numbers enabled a  
 nursery class to be established.      
 Although on the fringe of Swansea's   
 suburbia,the building is on an        
 enviable,elevated site enjoying rural 
 surroundings with a view down Clyne   
 Valley towards Swansea Bay.The grounds
 are extensive and the children have a 
 playground,games field,as well as     
 other extensive grassed areas for play
 or study.                             
 The School is supported by a very     
 active Parents' Association which has 
 supplied many items of equipment as a 
 result of fund-raising activities.
