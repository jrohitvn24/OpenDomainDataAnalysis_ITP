		<title>20HOW I SPENT MY SATURDAY</title>
		<content> My watch alarm woke me at 8.15 and I  
 got dressed in my track suit and went 
 downstairs to watch the Saturday      
 Picture Show on television.  I then   
 rang friends to see if they wanted    
 to play football on the playing       
 fields, they agreed to meet me there. 
 We had a good game until 1 pm then I  
 had to go home for lunch. My mum      
 decided to go to Chester because my   
 dad let us have the car since he was  
 working afternoons.  After taking him 
 to work we drove to Chester where my  
 mum and I looked around the shops.  We
 had tea at McDonalds and then went    
 into W H Smith's and bought a computer
 game.  At home I played on my computer
 until half past nine then my mum and I
 went to pick my dad up from work and  
 he drove us home.  I then went to bed 
 and read Indiana Jones and the Temple 
 of Doom.  {(Recreation)}              </content>
