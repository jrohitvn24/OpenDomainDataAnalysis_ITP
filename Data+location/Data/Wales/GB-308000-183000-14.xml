		<content> It must be said that there exists a   
 small ammount of distrust between the 
 older and younger members of the      
 Gwaelod-y-Garth community.            
 The pensioners feel that the young    
 people who have moved into the area   
 are slightly standoffish because of   
 the way they take very little interest
 in community life.                    
 The pensioners are also slightly      
 bitter that homes they once bought for
 around #300 are now changing hands for
 as much as #50000.                    
 The feeling is that these people care 
 more about property values than they  
 do about community life. If the basic 
 fabric of the buildings is in danger  
 or some new development is planned    
 then they will join together in       
 protest. Most of the time however, the
 older residents are very much on their
 own.                                  </content>
