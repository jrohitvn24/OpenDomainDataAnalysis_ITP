		<content> The section is split 50/50 rural and  
 urban with a preponderance of Local   
 Authority housing-semi-detached,      
 terraced and some flats, maisonettes  
 and old people's bungalows in the     
 urban area.  Recent private           
 residential building has occurred.    
 Part of the urban section includes    
 much of the town's commercial area    
 with a controversial pedestrainised   
 shopping zone.  Education             
 establishments cater for nursery      
 through to further education.The axed 
 Barry Teacher Training College in 189 
 may soon be demolished to privide     
 private housing against much          
 opposition.  Christian churches       
 although prevalent reflect a former   
 popular allegiance.  Health, welfare, 
 leisure and transport facilities are  
 adequate.  The rural areas include    
 farming, afforestation and recreation.</content>
