		<content>{ The Youth Club first began in 1950.  
 The leader was Mr.Jeffrey Hicks.      
{Meetings wre held in the Sunday School
{room}adjoining the Chapel.{Later it   
{was decided to build a Youth Club     
{hall.}This was achieved after much    
 hard work and through the generosity  
 of people in the village and surround_
 ing area.{The official opening was    
{held on Sept.13th 1975.}The leader is 
 Mr.John Brock.                        
{ Members meet on Friday evenings.}The 
 boys learn various skills in the      
 workshop. The girls are involved in   
 crafts and needlework. Sometimes a    
 speaker is invited to give a talk.    
  The Youth Centre is also used by the 
 community for coffee mornings and for 
 sales when items made at the Centre   
 are sold.                             
  Recently it has been used by other   
 Youth Clubs who spend holidays there. </content>
