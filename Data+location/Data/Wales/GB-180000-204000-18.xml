		<title>18Boating in Dale</title>
		<content> Boating is a very popular leisure     
 activity.Of the 90 or so occupied     
 houses in the area,26 own 1 or more   
 boats.Many more boats are owned by    
 visitors.There is no harbour,but about
 150 boats are kept on sheltered       
 moorings to the N.W. of Dale Point.   
 About 50 dinghies are kept at the top 
 of the beach.Others are brought down  
 for short periods on trailers or car  
 roofs.Many of these boats are used for
 sailing;the larger ones,up to 40' long
 for cruising and racing;the smaller   
 ones for day sailing in Milford Haven 
 and racing organised by Dale Yacht    
 Club.Other boats are used for fishing 
 or general enjoyment and exploration. 
 These are mostly boats with inboard or
 outboard engines.Some boats are used  
 by divers,who go out to wrecks or     
 other interesting underwater          
 locations.                            </content>
