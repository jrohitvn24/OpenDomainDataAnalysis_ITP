		<content> The Lordship of Hope suffered greatly 
 during the Civil War (1642-9), as did 
 most of England and Wales, and it is  
 mentioned in 1652 that 'the towne of  
 Hope now decayid who sumtime burgesid 
 and privilegid'. {(Local history)}    
                                       
 The area's wealth of{housing}continued
 to prosper in the 18th century.       
 Rhyddyn Hall was founded by the Glynne
 family, one of which married William  
 Gladstone, the eminent statesman.     
 Although some of it dates from the    
 13th century, its most striking       
 feature is its fine Georgian north    
 face.  Hope Hall, built in 1756 by the
 Rector of Westbury, but now destroyed,
 and Hartsheath Hall, built in 1823 by 
 an eminent architect, Charles         
 Matthews, and still standing in its   
 full glory, also contribute to the    
 architecture inspired by that era.    </content>
