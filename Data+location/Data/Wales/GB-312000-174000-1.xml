		<content>} The area covered in the project is   
 located on the west side of Cardiff in
 an area known as Ely.It has a main    
 road running through it called        
 Cowbridge Road which from the build up
 of Cardiff as a major commercial      
 centre was the main thoroughfare from 
 the city westward, this has now been  
 superceeded by the M4 Motorway.The    
 area is predominantly urban with      
 pockets of light  industry and        
 commerce.It areas of open land .It has
 a much historical background,with a   
 Roman villa and Hill Fort both located
 in the area.Also a mill is to be found
 on the local river Ely which runs     
 through the area from North to        
 South.Although area appears to have   
 many natural advantages the evidence  
 of the 1981 census show it to be a    
 major area of deprivation.    cont.
