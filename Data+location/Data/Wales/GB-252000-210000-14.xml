		<content> Recently in the 70's a piece of waste 
 land behind a large Council Housing   
 Estate in Lower Tumble was cleared by 
 the local residents and turned into a 
 park for the children. It has a B.M.X.
 track, benches, swings, a slide and   
 a climbing frame in the shape of a    
 house.                                
   In Upper Tumble there is another    
 park with picnic tables, benches,     
 swings, a slide and two climbing      
 frames, one shaped like a lorry and   
 trailer and the other shaped like a   
 house with a slide inside.            
   Reclaimed Opencast mined land in the
 centre of the village has also been   
 reseeded and planted with trees, thus 
 enabling the local residents to use it
 for recreation and leisure pursuits.  
   All the parks come under the control
 of Llanelli Borough Council.
