		<title>09    Health in Cwmbran</title>
		<content>   Health and welfare in our area is   
 the responsibility of the Gwent Health
 Authority. There are 14 health        
 agencies in our grid, of which one is 
 a clinic, eleven are doctors,another  
 is an optician,and the last is a      
 hospital.                             
   The Llanfrechfa Grange Hospital is  
 for the mentally handicapped and they 
 cater for all age ranges.             
   We are looked after in school by    
 regular visits from the school nurse, 
 doctor and dentists who keep regular  
 checks on our physical growth. All    
 children are medically examined when  
 they first start school, i.e. 1st.    
 year infants. Anyone who has something
 wrong is then checked until they are  
 cleared.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
