		<title>18GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The block is almost completely rural. 
 There are parts of a number of small  
 villages, but no settlement is        
 completely contained in the block.    
 Most of the area is covered by        
 farmland. The farms are mixed farms.  
 Around the village of Halkyn the      
 scenery changes, as the land gets     
 higher so it becomes more desolate,   
 Halkyn is surrounded by moorland.     
                                       
 The main road to the North Wales      
 coast, the A 55, cuts the block into  
 two. It is very busy in the summer    
 with tourists.                        
                                       
 There are far more sheep than people  
 in this block of land, and far more   
 trees than houses as there are several
 small woods!
