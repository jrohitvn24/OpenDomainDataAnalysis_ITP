		<content> The area is milder &amp; has less snow    
 than surrounding districts but has    
 more rain than nearer the coast.      
 Rivers are clear &amp; clean except when  
 filled with stormwater &amp; support      
 declining numbers of trout &amp; salmon.  
 Water meadows are often flooded after 
 heavy rain &amp; river banks have to be   
 reinforced. Village springs still     
 flow &amp; 1 at least is in constant use  
 in preference to Water Authority      
 supply. There is a rich variety of    
 birds, water fowl &amp; flowers including 
 the rare spotted orchid. Remnants of  
 oak forests &amp; deciduous trees are     
 found, rowans &amp; hazels being common.  
 Many local footpaths which had become 
 overgrown have been reopened this     
 year. Bracken is a problem to the     
 farmers. Happily a few deciduous trees
 and hedges have been replanted.
