		<title>01A View from Mynydd Machen</title>
		<content> Our D-Block covers a mountainous area 
 between the Ebbw &amp; Rhymney valleys.   
 There are two major villages-Crosskeys
 in Ebbw valley &amp; Machen in Rhymney.Be-
 tween lies Mynydd Machen(362m).Towards
 the S.E. edge of the Ebbw side is the 
 northern end of Risca village.        
 We were a mining area(all pits now are
 worked out)and there are a number of  
 disused quarries.Another major feature
 is Crosskeys College- Wales's first   
 tertiary college.                     
 The area is heavily forested with con-
 ifer &amp; deciduous with rough grazing   
 for sheep.Other features are the pre- 
 dominance of religion-18 chapels-and  
 the Club/Institutes(9 in all)both of  
 which reflect the community life which
 in 1985 is fast changing.People of the
 area now travel away to work in other 
 pits or other industries.Even so the  
 unemployment rate is over 20%.{       </content>
