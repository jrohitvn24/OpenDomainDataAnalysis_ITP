		<content>  Abergele is situated around the river
 Gele on the coastal plain at the foot 
 of a limestone upland (Pen y Corddyn  
 Mawr) which forms the western slope of
 the Vale of Clwyd.  This was and is a 
 position favoured by travellers, being
 the easiest route from the industrial 
 populated areas to the east (Deeside, 
 Cheshire, Lancashire etc) to North    
 Wales. The town is one of the oldest  
 settlements in the area.              
 The Town of Abergele itself has a     
 population of approximately 14,000    
 lying at the foot of a chain of wooded
 hills approximately .25km from the    
 sea.  It has retained its image of a  
 market town with a livestock market on
 Mondays and Wednesdays.               
 Over the years the area has become    
 more and more popular as a place for  
 elderly people to retire the majority 
 coming from the Manchester area.      </content>
