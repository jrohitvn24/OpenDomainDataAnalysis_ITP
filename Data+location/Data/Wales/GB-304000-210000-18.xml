		<title>18PONTSTICILL FOLKLORE</title>
		<content> During the last century a young boy   
 from Vaynor ensured a place for       
 himself in local folklore.His name was
 William Berthllwyd;during the winter  
 nights would hollow out turnips and   
 carve faces into them and then place a
 small lit candle inside.He would then 
 go down to the church before the      
 evening service began and place his   
 turnip in the hedge near by to scare  
 the congregation who huddled together 
 for safety.The vicar on arrival went  
 to inspect the hideous face and found 
 it was only the grinning turnip with  
 William hiding nearby.William was duly
 locked in the shed whilst the service 
 proceeded.After the service the vicar 
 returned home for tea where he was    
 presented with a plate of mashed      
 turnip which reminded him of the incar
 cerated William.He was soon freed and 
 allowed to go home with a warning.    </content>
