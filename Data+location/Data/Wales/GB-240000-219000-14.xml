		<title>14A DAY OF A CARMARTHEN GIRL</title>
		<content> and Welsh are the lessons we have.    
    At 3.40.p.m,school finishes.I      
 usually walk home with Leighton Keenan
 who is a boy in my class.             
    When I arrive home I have tea.I    
 usually have chips or something else. 
 Then I go down Melanie's house.I watch
 videos.A video is a tape which you put
 into a machine which tapes programmes 
 off the television.I usually go home  
 at 9.00 p.m.                          
    On Mondays I watch a programme     
 called 'The Young Ones'.This is a     
 comedy programme and I think it is the
 best on T.V.                          
    After that has finished I go to    
 sleep or read a book.Sometimes I read 
 'Smash Hits'.Smash Hits is a good     
 magazine and it features some words of
 songs in the charts.I also read other 
 books by Enid Blyton.
