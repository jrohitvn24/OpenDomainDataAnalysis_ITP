		<content>   Until the Enclosure Acts, Bailey    
 Hill was common land. About 150 years 
 ago it became enclosed and divided    
 into small farms. Originally there was
 more farms than today. Some of the    
 farms have Welsh name Blain-y-Cwm,    
 Cwm-Gilla, Garth Farm and Gwernaffel  
 Others very English names like        
 Brookside, Woodhouse and Rookery.     
 Ferny House used to be called Hendre  
 Genau.                                
   The farming in this part of the     
 country is pastoral with supportive   
 feed crops _ grain, root crops and    
 hay. Sheep do very well on these hills
 along with beef cattle. Farmers sell  
 their sheep and cattle at Knigton     
 Market and  the  Spring and Autumn    
 Sales. Sometimes they buy at other    
 markets like Welshpool.               
  Veterinary services are available in 
 Knighton.                             </content>
