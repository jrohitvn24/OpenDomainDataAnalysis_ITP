		<content> Many of the houses in the area are at 
 least 100 years old. Of the 27 houses 
 only 7 have been built during the last
 20 years. All of the older houses have
 been improved, many with the help of  
 local authority improvement grants.   
      Most of the houses have mains    
 water, sewage disposal is by means of 
 septic tanks, and all receive mains   
 electricity connected in the late     
 fifties. Nearly all of the houses have
 a Rayburn or other solid fuel cooker, 
 sometimes heating additional radiators
 or with open fires to supplement. Some
 households burn wood and one or two   
 have oilfired heating.There is no     
 mains gas available. One house has    
 solar panels. Double glazing is       
 beginning to be installed.
