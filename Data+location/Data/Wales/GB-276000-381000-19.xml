		<title>19Llandudno Ski Complex.</title>
		<content>{  A 700 foot dry ski slope,}second    
 largest in Europe,{plus an artificial 
{toboggan run,}is proposed for the Gt. 
 Orme. The greensward of Happy Valley  
 would be used as a car park. After 14 
 months of talks, final approval has   
 not been given.  Some Town Councillors
 oppose the site of the car park as the
 land was given by the{Mostyn Family   
 for the use of the people of Llandudno
 and, as such, should belong to{Llan-  
{dudno Town Council,}not to{Aberconwy  
{Boro' Council}who are discussing the  
 development. The developers state that
 it would attract people from all over 
 the North-West, over 100,000 skiers a 
 year could be expected and the{British
{Dry Ski Slope Championships}could be  
 staged. Buses would carry most skiers 
 from the car park to the slopes.  An  
 800 name petition opposing the plan   
 was received by the Town Mayor.       </content>
