		<content>   Blaen-y-maes seems to offer little  
 for young people.This may explain the 
 ugly appearance of the area.There is  
 much vandalism,graffiti and litter    
 throughout the area.                  
    Blaen-y-maes School has wire mesh  
 windows and the roof is also covered  
 with wire.Many buildings in the area  
 have been vandalised.Some houses are  
 cared for but many are neglected and  
 untidy.Many stray dogs and horses     
 roam the area.                        
   There is a new police station next  
 to Blaen-y-maes.Burglaries are common,
 so many extra police patrol the area. 
   Many people believe that if more    
 facilities were provided for young    
 people there would be less vandalism  
 and fewer burglaries.                 
  The local council have been trying   
 to find ways of improving this area.
