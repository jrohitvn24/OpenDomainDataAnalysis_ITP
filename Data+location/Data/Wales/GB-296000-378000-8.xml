		<content> The School was built in{1829}by{LADY  
{BAMFORD-HESKETH},who was the mother of
 the Countess of Dundonald,and lived in
 Gwrych Castle,Abergele.               
 The first headmaster was a{MR.NOAKES} 
 from Devon,who was also the church    
 organist.He did not allow any child to
 speak{WELSH}in school,and he caned any
 child that he caught.At that time all 
 the children in the area spoke Welsh  
 and very few could speak English.     
 Lady Bamford-Hesketh gave prizes each 
 year to the best pupils.              
 The school{closed in 1950}and was     
 rehoused as Towyn Junior School on    
 its present site in Morfa Avenue.
