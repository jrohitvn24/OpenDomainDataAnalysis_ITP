		<title>13CILFFRIW,A WELSH VILLAGE - 1</title>
		<content>    I have spelt the name of my village
 in the Welsh way,but some people may  
 use the{English version}which is      
{Cilfrew.}It is an old village and most
 of the people who live in my part of  
 the village have always lived there.  
 Some of them can remember the time    
 when there was{industry and plenty of 
{work}near Cilffriw,but today there is 
 nothing like this. Everyone has to    
 travel to{other places in search of   
{work.   }                             
    There are six main streets,some of 
 the older streets,such as New Road and
 Rosser Terrace,consist of{old terraced
{houses}which date back to the earliest
 time of the village-about{150 years- }
 but there are also two new estates.   
 One is a large council estate and the 
 other is a small private one.
