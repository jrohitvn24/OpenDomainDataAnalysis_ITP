		<content>                                       
 Results show that this junction is    
 very busy, with most traffic using the
 main A55(T) road.There were many      
 lorries which came from local areas   
 but we were surprised to see some from
 Dublin, Rochdale and Liverpool. From  
 just carrying out this small project  
 it is obvious that Northop does have  
 a traffic problem and a bye-pass is   
 needed.                               
  Northop councillors are calling for a
 reduced speed limit on a road where a 
 small child was knocked down this     
 week.Residents are worried about the  
 speed of traffic travelling along the 
 main road from Northop to Flint.They  
 say that more accidents could occur as
 young children cross the busy stretch 
 of road near Northop Cricket Club.Part
 of the road already has a 30mph limit,
 which may be extended into the village</content>
