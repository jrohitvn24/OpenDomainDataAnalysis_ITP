		<content>   My name is{James Roach John.}I live 
 in Crowhill House,Haverfordwest, which
 was built over 100 years ago. Scolton 
 is the name of the field next door    
 because the huntsmen from Scolton     
 Manor would leave their horses there  
 to graze in the summer months.        
   First thing on a Saturday morning I 
 get up and go with my father to feed  
 and let out the dogs. We have {21     
{Labradors, 7 English Springers}and{2  
{Cocker Spaniels}(we also have{2 Cocker
{puppies).}Next we clean and hose out  
 their kennels.                        
   We take{one dog at a time}into a    
 nearby field for TRAINING...my father 
 throws a{green canvas bag}as a dummy; 
 he fires his{starting pistol}and then 
{]]] SENDS THE DOG AFTER THE DUMMY [[[ 
   These training sessions help us when
 we go on{'Shoots'}&amp; even to win money 
 at the{Pembrokeshire Gun-dog Trials.  </content>
