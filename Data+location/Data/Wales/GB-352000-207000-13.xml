		<title>13VILLAGE SUB-POST OFFICES</title>
		<content>{Newland Post Office Stores}is         
 owned and run by{Mr. and Mrs.Bromhead.
 They sell cigarettes, grocery, includ-
 ing high class items, confectionery,  
 maps, Newland keyrings and postcards. 
 Opening hours are 9.00-1.00 and 2.00- 
 5.30,except for Tuesday and Thursday  
 afternoons.As few children live in    
 Newland, customers are mainly adults. 
 Half of the customers buy their weekly
 shopping in the shop because they     
 prefer to support the village shop.   
 The rest probably use nearby super-   
 markets in{Monmouth}or{Coleford}and   
 buy single items in the village shop. 
{Penallt Post Office}is in the sitting 
 room of{Mrs. Frost's}500 year old     
 Welsh long house in Lone Lane. The    
 Post Office used to be in the village 
 but the sub-postmistress retired and  
 the property was sold.
