		<title>08Westfield School,Malpas</title>
		<content>           This is a{special school}for
 children with physical and mental     
 handicaps.There is a{wide range of    
{disability}in each age group and great
 range in physical size and strength.  
   Children from Malpas Church in Wales
 Junior School visit Westfield School  
 regularly.Initially there was complete
 lack of understanding of{handicapped  
 children and a nervousness about      
 approaching them. Opinions changed    
 gradually during visits.The school is 
 bright,friendly and cheerful with lots
 of{equipment}and activities.          
   Some children at Westfield have no  
 special awareness and little self     
 control.However,with{patience}and     
 kindness,teachers help each child to  
 develop as far as that child can.
