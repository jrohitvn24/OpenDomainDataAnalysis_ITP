		<title>17Mr LLOYD</title>
		<content>  Geogina talked to Mr Lloyd of Pentre 
 farm - one of the few people who were 
 born in the village and have spent    
 most of their lives in Painscastle.   
  Mr Lloyd has lived in Painscastle for
 74 years. He is Welsh ,owns a 147     
 acre farm and is a worthy patron of   
 the village. He is well liked and     
 respected by both young and old. He   
 attended Painscastle school, leaving  
 at the age of 14. He spends time      
 talking to the village children and   
 oviously enjoys the developement of   
 his family's life in the village. His 
 two grandchildren live nearby. He     
 takes prode in the changes in the     
 village but is saddened by the        
 amalgamation of farms so losing one   
 family perhaps. He hopes the          
 traditions of country life will be    
 carried on as he loves the village,   
 its folk and the active life he leads.</content>
