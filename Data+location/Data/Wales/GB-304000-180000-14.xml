		<title>14Interview-Mrs. Rimes aged 92</title>
		<content> Mrs. Rimes has lived in Creigiau all  
 her life and was the wife of the      
 station master in the village. The    
 passenger railway (Barry line) started
 in about 1890. Creigiau station soon  
 became a busy place with passengers   
 walking a considerable distance to    
 board the train for Cardiff, Barry,   
 Pontypridd. The adjacent railway was  
 known as the Taff line which carried  
 coal and limestone to the Cardiff     
 docks. By 1935 there was a signal box 
 by the bridge. The railway was very   
 busy and trains even ran on Sunday.   
 The trains mostly carried coal from   
 the valleys. Coal trains used to run  
 from Pontypridd to Barry. There was   
 another line for the quarry which     
 arrived at 6.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m.    
 which carried limestone.
