		<content> The Cross Keys Public House is well   
 over 200 years old,and has always been
 known by this name.Originally it was  
 owned and run by a Chester brewery,   
 today,by the Greenhall Whitley        
 Company.In the past it was used as a  
 coaching house and the building where 
 the horses and coaches were kept is   
 still standing and is now used as a   
 changing room for the local football  
 team.The hitching rail is still       
 visible in a corner at the rear of the
 building.The bottle room above the    
 stables is called the Band Room where 
 in 1911 Northop Silver Prize Band     
 first formed and practised.The Cross  
 Keys used to be one of four pubs in   
 the village but now it is the only one
 left.About a hundred years ago an     
 extension was built to the main       
 building in keeping with the original 
 architecture.                         </content>
