		<content> We noticed three main differences.    
 Firstly,some of the names used in 1900
 were localised names which are not in 
 use today - Wild duck for Mallard,    
 Willow Wren for Willow Warbler and    
 Land rail for Corn crake,(also no     
 mention of Marsh tits).Secondly,since 
 1900 some species are no longer       
 present in the area,Merlin, Hobby,    
 Landrail and Wryneck in particular.   
    Finally,we noted some species which
 are today present but were not        
 mentioned in 1900.Collared Dove,Little
 Owl and Marsh Tit are examples of     
 this final category.                  
    To discover the variety of species 
 that may be discovered on a walk      
 through the block we decided to spend 
 a morning exploring the region,and    
 noting down all the species           
 recorded.We split into two groups, and
                                       </content>
