		<content> Monday 22nd April.                    
 Today I got up at 6.30a.m. and my     
 mother got up at 7.30a.m.I went up to 
 dress.I washed my face and hands then 
 I cleaned my teeth.I had some toast.At
 8.40a.m.I went to call my friend.We   
 got to school at 9.00am.We waited for 
 Sir and we went over the hall for     
 assembly.We sat down and we sang a    
 song. One of the teachers told us a   
 story and he asked us questions.We    
 said a prayer and we left the hall to 
 go back to class.                     
 We did an essay and then we did some  
 maths.Now it was dinner time.After    
 play we went back to class.The police 
 came to explain the Green Cross       
 Code.They showed us how to cross the  
 road.Then it was home time.When I got 
 home I dressed and went to Cubs.I came
 back home and went to bed at 9.45pm.
