		<content> Books were few,black and white with   
 few pictures.When a person left       
 home,their mother would give them a   
 Bible.Most people were Welsh          
 speaking.The newcomers spoke English. 
 Workers wore clogs and every farm had 
 a tractor,but only a few had milking  
 machines.A cow and calf cost Â£100.    
 Some farm-workers slept above the     
 stable.There was no mains or hot      
 water.Flagstones covered the floor.The
 chimneys were big.Culm a mixture of   
 coal dust and clay,which burned with a
 blue flame gave heat.There was no     
 electricity,only oil lamps.Oil cookers
 were used for cooking.Nearly everybody
 went to worship three times on a      
 Sunday.Children did not play.All      
 Sunday's work was done on Saturday.   
 When they passed the 11+ they went to 
 Cardigan Grammar.If they failed they  
 stayed at the local school.           </content>
