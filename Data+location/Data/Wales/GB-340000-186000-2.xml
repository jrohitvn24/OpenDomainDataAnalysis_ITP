		<content>  My home is a large detached house    
 with five bedrooms.I don't have any   
 pets because my rabbit escaped.       
  When I come from school I bring my   
 friend Catherine with me.When I come  
 in I have something to eat.My         
 brother,who is fourteen,comes in at   
 4:00,and he brings in my other brother
 who is four years old,and looked after
 by a person called Mrs Ingle.         
  When Catherine and I have changed we 
 call for Lisa Dow our friend,and have 
 a game of tennis.Catherine's Dad comes
 for her at 5:30.                      
  My Mum and Dad come in from work at  
 6:00,and we have dinner.After that I  
 take a tape recorder over to the field
 and have a game of football with my   
 older brother.I get home at around    
 8:00 and then I watch television,my   
 younger brother is in bed by then.At  
 9:30 I go to bed and read.            </content>
