		<content> THIS IS A MAINLY RURAL AREA           
 SITUATED IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE      
 RADNOR FOREST AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE  
 RADNOR VALLEY. THE  SMATCHER          
 HILL,(1396 feet) DOMINATES THE        
 AREA AND LOOKS DOWN ON THE VILLAGE OF 
 NEW RADNOR, WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE
 COMMUNITY.MANY SMALL FARMS ARE        
 SCATTERED AROUND THE HILLS AND IN THE 
 VALLEY. THE MAIN A44 ABERYSTWYTH      
 TO WORCESTER ROAD RUNS THROUGH THE    
 VILLAGE , BUT RECENTLY A NEW BY PASS  
 WAS BUILT AROUND THE PERIMETER        
 BRINGING PEACE TO A ONCE VERY BUSY    
 THOROUGHFARE. A GOODS SHED IS THE ONLY
 EVIDENCE REMAINING OF THE BRITISH     
 RAILWAY BRANCH LINE  THAT ONCE RAN    
 REGULARLY FROM KINGTON TO NEW RADNOR. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
