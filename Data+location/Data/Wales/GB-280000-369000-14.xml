		<content> Most of the children in our school    
 have a bike. But many children have   
 problems going up hills and also there
 is a lot of traffic. Two boys in our  
 school have motor bikes and they ride 
 them mostly in the fields. Many young 
 people in our village have motor bikes
 to go shopping, for work and for      
 pleasure. A motor bike is cheaper to  
 buy and run than a car. People use    
 cars for shopping, going to work,     
 visiting friends and relatives and    
 going on holiday. Every Tuesday there 
 is a bus to Llanrwst for people to go 
 to the market. There are buses going  
 to Llandudno and Colwyn Bay every day 
 except Sunday and the bus does not go 
 to Colwyn Bay every day. The nearest  
 railway station is Tal-y-cafn, a      
 single track joining the main line at 
 Llandudno Junction. Nearest airports  
 are at Manchester and Liverpool.      </content>
