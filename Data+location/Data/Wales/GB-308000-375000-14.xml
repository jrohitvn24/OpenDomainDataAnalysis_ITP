		<content> The biggest disadvantages voiced in   
 the survey were the total lack of     
 shopping facilities locally, bus      
 services and a Doctors Surgery. On a  
 general scale Nuclear war, Civil war  
 or both were of great concern. Poverty
 in the World was seen as an obscenity 
 in our world of plenty. With the have 
 and the have-nots being driven further
 apart. It was felt by many that there 
 is too much tolerance shown to the    
 criminals and law-breakers in our     
 society and not enough for the        
 victims. It is feared that the world  
 will continue on its self destructive 
 course and that people should be      
 educated to appreciate what they have 
 in life and stop thinking that the    
 world owes them a living.
