		<content> The Alyn Gorge: A landscape feature   
 here is the steep-sided 'gorge' which 
 the River Alyn has cut through the    
 limestone ridge. It is believed that  
 the course of the river was diverted  
 to this north-eastward line during the
 Ice Age, when the original northerly  
 course may have been blocked by ice.  
 The sides of the gorge are steep,     
 rather than sheer, and are mostly     
 covered by deciduous woodland.        
 The Dry River-Bed: Since limestone is 
 permeable, much river-water sinks     
 underground into 'swallow-holes' in   
 the rock. In periods of low flow all  
 water may disappear further upstream  
 and the whole length of the river-bed 
 in this area may be dry for several   
 weeks each summer. The farm at the    
 Cilcain end of the gorge is           
 appropriately named 'Hesp Alyn' _     
 Welsh for 'Dry Alyn'.                 </content>
