		<title>10HOUSING IN AMMANFORD</title>
		<content>  Most of the housing in the area was  
 built before WWI, they were used by   
 the local coal and steel workers.     
  Many of these houses have been       
 modernised and improved recently;     
 other properties have been demolished 
 for new developments.                 
  A great deal of house building was   
 carried out in the 50's and 60's. The 
 road patterns of that period have a   
 circular and diagonal design. Heol    
 Wallasey, Myddynfych, Brynhafod,      
 Parcyrhun Est. and Maesydail are      
 council estates, typical of that      
 period. Carregamman Est. was built of 
 pre-fab units immediately after WWII. 
  Most recent developments have been on
 the outskirts of Ammanford. Private   
 housing ests. have been built since   
 the late 60's; Wernoleu,Maesycoed and 
 Penydre.
