		<title>04ACTIVITIES ON THE R. TEIFI</title>
		<content>{ANGLING}-The Llandysul Angling        
 Association owns 17 miles of the river
 TEIFI and rent 9 miles. A season      
 ticket costs Â£45, but Old Age         
 Pensioners and students pay Â£17, and  
 school boys Â£2. A weekly ticket costs 
 Â£20. Fishing is mainly for trout,     
 salmon, and sewin. There are 460      
 members. The modes of fishing are fly,
 spinning, and worming. The club hopes 
 to include lake fishing later.        
{CANOEING}- The canoeing occurs between
 March and October. Canoeists use this 
 stretch of the Teifi because fast     
 water and rocks provide a good        
 "Slalom" course. The canoeists, who   
 camp on the river bank, are mainly    
 from the Armed Forces and collages.   
 Twice yearly Bristol University holds 
 Slalom races for competitors from all 
 over the country. In summer the river 
 is often too shallow for canoeing.    </content>
