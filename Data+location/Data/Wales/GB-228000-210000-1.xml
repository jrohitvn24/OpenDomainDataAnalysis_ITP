		<content> This section of West Wales covers the 
 estuary of the River Taf on the west  
 shore of Carmarthen Bay, and has dairy
 and stock farms on rolling hills, well
 wooded and watered with a considerable
 area of salt marshes.  Laugharne Town,
 at the confluence of the Rivers Taf   
 and Corran, developed on a Celtic     
 settlement site and preserves its     
 feudal system of local government     
 (Charter 1307).  It owns property and 
 land which passes to 76 Burgesses who 
 are Shareholders and farm their strips
 or let them, in the Open Field System.
 Two hamlets, each with an ancient     
 Church, Llansadurnen 400' high west of
 Laugharne and Llandawke in a steep    
 valley, contain a few farms and       
 houses. The area is richly varied with
 many land and sea birds and profusions
 of wild flowers along banked lanes.
