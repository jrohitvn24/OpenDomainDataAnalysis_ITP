		<title>04Skenfrith Mill</title>
		<content> Skenfrith Mill was built before 1500  
 and was rebuilt in 1867. The Edwards  
 Family has owned it for 90 years.     
  Wholemeal flour is produced by       
 grinding high  protein milling wheat  
 between slow moving millstones.No     
 artificial preservatives are added to 
 this flour. Animal feed is produced   
 from a mixture of barley, oats and    
 wheat. Milling is carried out on      
 Saturdays and the flour is sold fresh 
 from the mill as well as being        
 transported to local towns.           
  The machinery is driven by a water   
 wheel which has 30 wooden paddles.    
 The water wheel drives the pit wheel. 
 The Wallower Wheel turns the Great    
 Spur wheel which drives the Crown     
 Wheel.                                
  The miller judges the quality of the 
 flour by using his "Thumb of Gold".
