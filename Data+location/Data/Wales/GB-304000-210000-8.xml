		<title>08THE OLD RECTORY</title>
		<content> The Rectory stands about a quarter of 
 a mile from ST Gwendolines church.The 
 Rectory began its life as a farmhouse 
 and also a provided  accommodation for
 passing drovers,who were men taking   
 their livestock to market.We know this
 by the line of Douglas Firs alongside 
 the lane which marked a place to stay 
 in the last century.It then became a  
 school,we know this because of the    
 rows and rows of coat pegs in the     
 kitchen,and the ink bottles which were
 found in the garden.The women who     
 owned it left the buiding to the      
 church making all the land around it  
 Glebeland (land of the church).As a   
 result it became a rectory to provide 
 accommodation for the vicar of the    
 parish of Vaynor.Despite the rectory  
 being so big the vicar only lived in  
 two rooms.
