		<title>02RIVER STUDY: AFON LWYD</title>
		<content>   The river{Afon Lwyd}runs through a  
 valley{(or Cwm)}which was ground out  
 by a{glacier}millions of years ago.   
   It runs, North to South, for about  
 13 miles. Its source is in the moun-  
 tains above{Abersychan.}From there it 
 flows through{Pontewynydd, Pontypool, 
{Llanfrechfa}until it reaches{Caerleon,
 just above{Newport,}where it flows    
 into the{River Usk}(eventually to join
 the{River Severn}and{Bristol Channel).
   The name{Afon Lwyd}is Welsh and     
 means{'grey water'.}Although it has   
 been very polluted in the past, the   
 river is now clean and only looks grey
 because of the{limestone bedrock.     
   Sewage still runs into the river but
 it is so clean now that it is full of 
 life (e.g. salmon and trout).         
  {A railway}was built alongside it in 
{1852}and{a canal}was joined to it in  
{1797.}It has{flooded only once c1930. </content>
