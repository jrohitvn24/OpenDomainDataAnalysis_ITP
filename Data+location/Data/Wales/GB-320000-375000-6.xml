		<content> Bagillt used to have one of the       
 largest lead smelting works in the    
 world.Pig lead was exported even as   
 far as America.Ships left the local   
 docks for Bristol,Liverpool,Chester.  
 There were   local lead works in the  
 immediate area.The last lead works    
 closed in 1900.    .Bagillt was also  
 known                                 
 for its   collieries.The last one     
 closed in 1934    .Most of the local  
 people either worked in the lead works
 or collieries.                        
 More recently,most of the people used 
 to work at Shotton steel              
 works(Shotton)and at Courtaulds(Flint 
 and Greenfield).Courtaulds made rayon 
 and viscose.Many people became        
 redundant when Courtaulds(Flint)      
 closed and Shotton steel works partly 
 closed.Locally there is 68%           
 unemployment.                         </content>
