		<title>13THE COLWYN BAY PIONEER</title>
		<content> The Pioneer is a local{newspaper}which
 ceased production during the war.It   
 was relaunched in 1971.Until about two
 years ago a charge was made for the   
 paper,but it is now distributed {free 
 to about{30 000}homes and offices     
 every week.The weekly production costs
 of roughly Â£7 000 are met by revenue  
 from advertising;items for sale,wanted
 or lost;jobs and services etc..30% of 
 space is reserved for news or comment.
   Over recent months the topics most  
 frequently in the headlines have      
 included the construction of the new  
{express way}and the effect that it is 
 having on the community eg.demolition 
 of houses,loss or increase of trade,  
 ease of access to the area by both    
 tourists and burglars.Also in the     
 news are cuts in local services _     
 currently the proposed abolition of   
 nursery education for three year olds.</content>
