		<content>   All Saints Church was built in 1140.
 The most recent part of the building  
 is only 70 years old. There have been 
 30 Vicars. The first one was Vicar    
 Samson and the present one is the     
 Reverend Geoffrey Thomas.             
                                       
   The clock was put in the tower in   
 1875 by Francis Tippins and the bells 
 hung in 1954. Eight services a week   
 are held. The choir members wear red  
 robes.                                
                                       
   Many visitors come each year        
 especially to see the Lady Chapel, the
 font, the bells from Santiago in Chile
 and the Lifeboat Memorial Window.     
                                       
   A famous person buried in the       
 churchyard is Thomas Bowdler who      
 expurgated the works of Shakespeare.
