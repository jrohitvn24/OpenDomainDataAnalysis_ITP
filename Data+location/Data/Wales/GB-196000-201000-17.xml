		<title>17A COSHESTON FAMILY SUNDAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 Sunday in Cosheston is different to   
 the other days. The children do not   
 have to go to school. people can lie  
 in bed a little later. Some go to     
 church at the village church but not  
 as many go now as in the past. Some of
 the children go to Sunday School.     
    Many people have a big Sunday      
 dinner and afterwards they may just   
 watch T.V or they might go for a walk 
 along the coast path or visit the     
 Sports Centre in Pembroke for a swim  
 or a game of squash or tennis.        
    In the summer, many families will  
 go to one of the nearby beaches and   
 spend the day there. They might go for
 a picnic in the country.              
    In the evening, they would get     
 ready for school or work the next day 
 and the parents might go to the pub or
 watch T.V.                            </content>
