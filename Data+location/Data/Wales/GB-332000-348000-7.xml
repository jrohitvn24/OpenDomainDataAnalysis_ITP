		<title>07CHANGES IN WREXHAM</title>
		<content> Mrs. Kitty Davies of Bryn Offa has    
 lived in Wrexham for over 60 years.   
 She remembers it as a much smaller    
 town when horses were used to pull    
 milk carts. She remembers V.E.        
 day especially, when a street party   
 was held in Bradley Road. She thinks  
 some aspects of the town have improved
 but she prefered it as it was when it 
 was smaller.                          
 Mrs. Jane Davies of 124 Bryn Offa has 
 lived in the town for 72 years. She   
 remembers when the town boasted 4     
 cinemas- the Glynn, Majestic,         
 Hippodrome, Odeon. She thinks the town
 has changed for the worse. She misses 
 the little shops and doesn't like the 
 supermarkets. She thinks that the     
 people have changed too!              
 Mr. David Williams has lived in the   
 town for 80 yrs and remembers trams   
 travelling along the streets.         </content>
