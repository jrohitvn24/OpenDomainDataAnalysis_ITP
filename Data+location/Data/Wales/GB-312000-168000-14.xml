		<title>14MY SPECIAL DAY</title>
		<content> Sunday morning I usually wake at 9am  
 and get dressed.  I then go into the  
 dining room for breakfast - cheese on 
 toast, an egg, rice crispies and a cup
 of tea.  After breakfast I go to      
 church with my sister.  We worship    
 with grown ups for about twenty       
 minutes then we go to our Sunday Schol
 lessons.  there are two groups in     
 sunday School - children 2yrs - 7 yrs 
 and 8yrs - 11yrs.  Today I must rush  
 home from church.  My dad has bought  
 me a desk from MFI and I am going to  
 help him assemble it and fit it in my 
 bedroom.  I am having a portable      
 television and a new bookcase - this  
 means that I can watch my programes   
 without interfering with family       
 viewing.  I do not spend all my free  
 time watching TV.  I also enjoy       
 reading my favourite books are        
 adventure stories.                    </content>
