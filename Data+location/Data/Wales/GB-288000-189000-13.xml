		<title>13Transport in Pontycymer</title>
		<content>  Before industry came to Ponytcymer   
 the chief means of travel  was        
 by horse and cart. Communications and 
 industry developed together.          
  First came the tramlines, and then in
 1872, the Ogmore Railway was extended 
 into the Garw valley and in 1886 a    
 railway was built from Brynmenyn to   
 the valley. The railways were         
 originally built for both coal and    
 passenger transport, but the latter   
 ceased in 1953.                       
  The railway lines run in parallel to 
 the Garw River, as do the two main    
 roads, Bridgend Road and the A4064    
 which provides a link with the M4.    
  The only public service in Pontycymer
 and the valley today is the national  
 Welsh Bus service, but this has also  
 deteriorated in recent years.
