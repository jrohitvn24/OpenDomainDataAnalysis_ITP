		<title>02Houses in the area</title>
		<content> In the village of Llanlleoch, to the  
 north of our area, some of the houses 
 near the church are old buildings,    
 those in Mill Row and Boxburgh Hall.  
 Others in the estate are modern, built
 in the last 20 years.Here the         
 dwellings are entirely bungalows and  
 have all modern conveniences.  The    
 older houses have all been modernized 
 and have had main sewerage exteded to 
 them in 1985.  The farmhouses in the  
 area are older but have been brought  
 up to modern standards and now much   
 favoured as dwellings.  The newer     
 houses have tiled roofs while the     
 older ones have roofs of Caernarvon   
 slate.
