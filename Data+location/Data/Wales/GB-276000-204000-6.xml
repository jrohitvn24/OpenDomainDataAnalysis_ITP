		<title>06River Keeper on the Dulais.</title>
		<content>      The water bailiff or{River Keeper
 as he prefers to be called has a wide 
 and varied set of duties to perform.  
 Besides checking on anglers to see if 
 they are in possession of a permit to 
 fish, the{River Keeper}also checks if 
 the fish which have been caught are of
 the permitted size and that no more   
 than the stated quantity have been    
 taken.                                
      The reason why he prefers to be  
 called the{River Keeper}is that his   
 duties also include ensuring that the 
 river is free of pollution and that   
 the area is safe for anglers to use.  
 In cases where pollution has been     
 detected or there is serious danger   
 from the river underwashing the banks 
 then the{River Keeper}notifies the    
 Water Board authorities who can then  
 deal with the problem.                
                                       </content>
