		<title>15A Day In My Life</title>
		<content>  My name is Claire Owens, I live in   
 Pembrey and this is a typical Saturday
 in my life. My day begins when my     
 mother wakes me at 7a.m I make my bed,
 brush my hair and go downstairs to    
 have my breakfast. Usually my family  
 are already there watching the morning
 breakfast programme on television.    
 Later we go to Llanelli to shop.On the
 way home we often call in the Stepney 
 Grill in Burry Port for coffee.       
  After dinner my father goes to see a 
 rugby match in Stradey.We go to Clyndu
 Riding School. My father takes us to  
 the Swimming Pool in Llanelli in the  
 evening, we are family members of the 
 Club.                                 
  The remainder of the evening is spent
 watching television or playing games  
 on my computer. Then its time for a   
 shower and bed. My father comes to say
 goodnight, the end of a happy day.    </content>
