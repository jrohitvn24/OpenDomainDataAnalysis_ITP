		<content>  This block is mainly farmland and    
 managed woodland.                     
  St.Arvans is the only village in the 
 block. The village is just north of   
 the town of Chepstow. Since the M4 and
 Severn Bridge were built in the 1970's
 St.Arvans has doubled in size.Many    
 people now work in Bristol and live in
 the village.                          
  The village has two shops one of     
 which is also a post-office,one pub   
 called the Piercefield,one church,one 
 hall,and one school.The school is 112 
 years old.                            
  Recently a long cave system has been 
 discovered. It stretches right under  
 this block from the River Wye in the  
 east, to Itton Hill on the western    
 edge of the block. Cavers believe that
 there are more tunnels and caves to be
 discovered.
