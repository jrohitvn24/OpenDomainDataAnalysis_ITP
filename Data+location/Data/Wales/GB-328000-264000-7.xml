		<content>     The church in Presteigne,which is 
 named{St.Andrew's,}dates back to{Saxon
 times and although it is in Powys it  
 is part of the Hereford dioscese.There
 is one interesting new{gravestone}in  
 the churchyard as the original has    
 been placed in the church.It belongs  
 to Mary Morgan who was a{domestic     
{servant at Newcastle Court.}On the    
 11th  of April 1805 she was tried for 
 murdering her new born baby.It is said
 that the baby's father was on the jury
 that found her guilty.                
     A man at the trial was disgusted  
 by the verdict and rode to London and 
 back, bringing with him a reprieve,   
 but when he reached Presteigne she had
 already been hung.She was originally  
 buried in unconsecrated ground but the
 land now belongs to the church.
