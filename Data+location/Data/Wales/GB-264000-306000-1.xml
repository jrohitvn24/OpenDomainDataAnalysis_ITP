		<content> The flood plain of Afon Dysynni is    
 dominated by the majestic spandour of 
 "Bird Rock", a formidable granite     
 out-crop that overlooks  the whole    
 valley as it runs NE to SW.  Situated 
 further up the valley there is the    
 strongold of Castell-y-Bere, a welsh  
 castle that strategically commands the
 whole region.  Much of the valley     
 plain is set astride for sheep and    
 cattle raising, and as usual, the     
 smaller tributory rivers that run into
 the Afon Dysynni, flow down steep     
 river valleys.  Although most of the  
 area is covered in grass and          
 heathland, there are several sections 
 dominated by either deciduous or      
 coniferous trees, especially around   
 Abergynolwyn, the only village of some
 size in the area.  Both  railway and a
 local bus service pass through this   
 village.                              </content>
