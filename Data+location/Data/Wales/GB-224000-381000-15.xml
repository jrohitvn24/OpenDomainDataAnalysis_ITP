 Vandalism                             
 There has been a general rise in the  
 amount of vandalism in the area.The   
 local magistrates court has to deal   
 with many more cases of young         
 offenders.The local police force have 
 a close liaison with the local        
 schools,with officers calling in to   
 explain about the need for law and    
 order.                                
 Films about child molesting have      
 also been shown by school liaison     
 officers.                             
 The constabulary are also to be seen  
 organising recreation activities for  
 schoolchildren and at the same time   
 stressing the need for closer         
 co-operation between the cmmunity and 
 the police to overcome vandalism.
