		<content> The communities of Hope and Caergwrle 
 have a long history, dating back some 
 6000 years.  The villages are located 
 just 4 miles from the English border  
 and yet retain a strong Welsh         
 identity.  Another remarkable feature 
 of these settlements is that they have
 managed to keep a strong sense of     
 community feeling. {(Local history)   
                                       
 Hope and Caergwrle are to be found in 
 a beautiful setting, located at the   
 foot of Hope Mountain, from where the 
 Cheshire Plain and Merseyside are     
 clearly visible.  Caergwrle used to   
 act as a magnet for surrounding areas 
 on account of its famous spa waters   
 but by 1985, along with Hope, it has  
 become a dormitory area with many of  
 its inhabitants finding employment in 
 Wrexham, Chester, Mold, Deeside and   
 Merseyside. {(Landscape)}             </content>
