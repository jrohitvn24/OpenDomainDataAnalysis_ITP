		<content> The past has left its marks on our    
 landscape and heritage. Ystyffan was a
 Celtic saint, Teilo's bard, descended 
 from Vortigern and from Magnus Maximus
 and Elin.The Castle recalls the Norman
 invader. Llanybri derives from Llan   
 Olbri and Ffynnon Olbri, perhaps      
 Oliver's church and well. Dylan Thomas
 often spoke about Llanybri and        
 Llansteffan in his poetry and prose.  
 The indigenous population mostly have 
 Welsh as their first language and are 
 bi-lingual. Welsh is the language of  
 the chapels, English of Llansteffan   
 Church whilst Llanybri Church is      
 bi-lingual. Often inhabitants are     
 mostly monoglot English speaking. It's
 not always peaceful here. Pembrey     
 bombing range, low flying RAF training
 aircraft and explosions from the MoD  
 range across the Taf often deafen and 
 alarm.                                </content>
