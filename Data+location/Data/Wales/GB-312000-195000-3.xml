 Glan-Rhymney,Tir-y-berth and Carn     
 Gethin farms were all originally owned
 and farmed by the same family,with    
 Glan-Rhymney being the home farm.Over 
 the years they have acquired new      
 owners and Carn-Gethin farm has       
 recently been used for residential    
 development.Tir-y-berth farm however  
 is still owned by the same family.    
 Tir-y-berth and Glan-Rhymney are      
 situated close to the village and are 
 both hill farms.The method of farming 
 chosen by these farms is well suited  
 to the environment.Glan-Rhymney       
 specialises in intensive poultry      
 production,the eggs being sold to the 
 local shops.This farm also produces   
 beef cattle Hereford and Freisian.The 
 calves are bought at the cattle market
 in Newport and reared on nurse        
 cows.When they are 18 to 20 months old</content>
