 houses and bungalows,council          
 houses and cottages.There are two     
 housing estates in Gellifor,Maes Hafal
 and Bodawen.There are 18 council      
 houses in Maes Hafal,some have been   
 bought by the tennants.Bodawen has 16 
 private houses,two of them still being
 built.The estate was started about 4-5
 years ago.                            
     Many of the houses are large,some 
 have been extended or improved so that
 there is more room to live in them.   
 Some houses have orchards of apple    
 and pear trees. Gellifor is well known
 locally for damsons and sugar plums.  
      Other housing in the area are    
 farms,scatterd cottages and one or two
 large country mansions.Some of these  
 are quite old - Plas yn Rhos being one
 of the oldest in the area dating from 
 the 16th century.                     </content>
