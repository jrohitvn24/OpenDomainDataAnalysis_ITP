		<title>12Abergele Town Council</title>
		<content> 1985- Housed in temporary             
 accommodation in a delapidated mobile,
 not really worthy of a respected and  
 important public body.  This is       
 situated in the grounds of Pentre Mawr
 Hopefully a worthy place will be      
 included in the new complex expected  
 to be built in 1986. Since 1983 The   
 Abergele UDC which included Towyn and 
 Llanddulas separated into Community   
 Councils each having its own chairman 
 or mayor.  Abergele obtained          
 permission from Welsh Office to retain
 title of Mayor.  The motto of the old 
 UDC - Heb Dduw Heb Ddim (Without God  
 Without Anything) has been retained   
 with the Regalia of the former        
 Council. Full Council meets on a      
 Monday at 6.30 pm every 6 weeks.      
 Main Council is divided into 2        
 sections, (a) general problems and    
 finance and (b) planning.             </content>
