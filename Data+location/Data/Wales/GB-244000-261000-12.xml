		<content> This was very important in the past.  
 Railway (now closed).Shipbuilding     
 (ended 1882). Shipping(last in 1934). 
 Like many small places it is less     
 important now and the bus depot is to 
 be closed.In rural areas transport is 
 a real problem, distances and petrol  
 prices make it expensive. People      
 have to have cars, therefore public   
 transport declines. Schools help to   
 keep bus companies alive in this      
 area. 12 buses serve this school___   
{Crosville,James Llangeithio,Albert    
{Lewis Llanrhystud.}The school buses   
 also serve the public and they are    
 very crowded at 7:30-9:00am and 4:00 -
 5:30pm otherwise they are rarely even 
 half full. They  go from Aberaeron to 
 Talgarreg:Llwyndafydd:N.Quay:Mydroilin
 :Cardigan:Llangrannog:Aberystwyth:    
 Lampeter:Tregaron:Cilcennin:Cribyn.   
 Most of these are quite remote.       </content>
