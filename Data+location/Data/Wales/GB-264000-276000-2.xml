		<content> An area of small farms rearing mainly 
 sheep on enclosed rough grazing, many 
 fields have been enlarged and fenced  
 rather than hedged. There is scrub,   
 spinneys &amp; hedgerows for wildlife but 
 most is found in the in the mixed     
 deciduous &amp; coniferous woodlands on   
 the slopes to the river Rheidol, a    
 salmon river. The woodlands &amp; its     
 margins are rich flora &amp; fauna        
 particularly &amp; wide varieties of bird 
 life. The gravel pits and river       
 attracts water birds and the Cormorant
 &amp; the Heron are regular visitors.     
 There is a strip of rough heath type  
 land on the south bank of the river   
 with gorse &amp; scrub which produce      
 another habitat. On the rougher more  
 open land " grazing " birds such as   
 Lapwings and Fieldfares are common.   
 There are also Kestrels, Red Kites &amp;  
 Buzzards nesting &amp; feeding locally.   </content>
