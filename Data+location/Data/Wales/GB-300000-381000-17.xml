		<title>17THE LIBRARY, RHYL</title>
		<content>  The Carnegie Free library in Rhyl    
 opened on 4th April, 1907, in the Town
 Hall. Mr. Andrew Carnegie, an American
 multi-millionaire of Scottish origin, 
 gave Â£3,000 towards the Library's cost
 after an application was made to the  
 Carnegie Trust by Rhyl Council. The   
 Library was in the Town Hall from 1907
 until 1982. Around the 1920s the      
 Library changed from the Carnegie Free
 Library to the Rhyl Municipal Library 
 and was run by the local borough. In  
 1974 the library system was under     
 reorganisation and Rhyl Municipal     
 Library now came under Clwyd County   
 Council Library Service with the main 
 headquarters in Shire Hall, Mold. At  
 present the Library is temporarily    
 housed at Morfa Hall awaiting the new 
 Library and Museum complex, due to be 
 completed by March, 1986. The new     
 library will be fully computerized.   </content>
