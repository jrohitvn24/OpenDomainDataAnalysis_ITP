		<content> Bird life is rich.Man-made Garth Lake,
 property of Garth House has large     
 numbers of wild duck of various kinds 
 in winter.Buzzards are common,red kite
 seen occasionally.Dipper and yellow   
 wagtail on decline as insect larvae   
 become scarce in rivers due to acid   
 rain. Cammarch and Dulas now have no  
 fish for same reason,the long term    
 effect on trees is,as yet,unknown.    
 Area of fairly high rainfall 40-50ins.
 per year.                             
 Frogs and toads still abundant,also   
 bats.Foxes,polecats and grey squirrels
 common enough to be pests to farmers. 
 Drainage of wet land causes loss of   
 bog flowers. Wild flowers have been   
 lost due to reseeding of pastures and 
 mechanical trimming of verges and     
 hedgebanks and hedges.
