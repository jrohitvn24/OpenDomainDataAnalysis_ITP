 CHANGES IN FARMING AND THE AREA.      
 Farming in this area has gradually    
 changed over the last 100 years,as has
 the area itself.About 25 years ago the
 farmer was more physically involved   
 and had a large workforce.Today, due  
 to mechanisation, he employs at most 3
 or 4 workers.Twenty years ago there   
 were more farms near Erbistock but the
 small farms have been amalgamated .   
 Some hedgerows and trees have been    
 removed but in recent times farmers   
 have become more conservation         
 conscious.Rabbits are again becoming  
 more of a problem and affect the      
 amount of grazing.A lot of the        
 cottages have been bought by outsiders
 and improved .Most of them work in    
 nearby towns.                         </content>
