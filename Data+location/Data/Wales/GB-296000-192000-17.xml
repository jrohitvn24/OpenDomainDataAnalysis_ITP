		<title>17LAND RECLAMATION SCHEME</title>
		<content>   Seventy years ago Cwmclydach was a  
 thriving mining community with more   
 than 5000 men employed in the Cambrian
 ,Cwmclydach,Blaenclydach and Old Dinas
 Collieries. They were gaseous mines   
 and in 1965, 35 miners were killed in 
 an explosion forcing the N.C.B. to    
 close Cambrian.                       
 The N.C.B. have sold the Site to the  
 District Council and it is being land-
 scaped as part of a National Land     
 Reclamation Scheme. The Welsh Devel-  
 opment Agency is financing the Scheme 
 which will cost Â£2,500000. Work began 
 in Jan.1985 and is to be completed in 
 1987. The area is being flattened with
 removed tips filling in valleys to    
 provide space for two lakes, two      
 housing areas, factory units, five    
 recreational areas, a school and an   
 allotment area. A Mid-Rhondda access  
 road is being built to link with M4.  </content>
