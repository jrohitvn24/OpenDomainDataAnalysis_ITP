		<title>05Transport in the area</title>
		<content>  Until comparatively recently the     
 area was a thriving {Coal_Mining}     
 community.It was linked by frequent   
 omnibus services with Carmarthen and  
 Llanelli and surrounding villages in  
 the valley.It was also,for nearly {40 
{Years}served by a passenger railway   
 service from{Cwmmawr}to{Burry Port}.  
  As the ownership of cars became      
 common the need for such transport    
 services declined and,as a result,the 
 area is not so well served by public  
 transport as it used to be in the     
 heyday of the local colliery. Since   
 the late 1960's the local railway has 
 carried coal and other freight;the    
 passenger service being dis_continued 
 as the demand for its services fell.  
 With the closure of the colliery and  
 the resulting outflow of workers from 
 the area to neighbouring towns,there  
 is a demand for more public transport.</content>
