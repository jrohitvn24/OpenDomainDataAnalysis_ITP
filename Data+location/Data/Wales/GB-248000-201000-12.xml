		<title>12Ecology - Wild Service Tree.</title>
		<content> Few native British trees can be noted 
 as rare,but the Wild Service is really
 uncommon.  There are only two known   
 Service trees in Dyfed one near Llan- 
 dovery and one is in Stradey Woods. At
 this latter location it grows on the  
 site of an old Iron Age fort. It is an
 inconspicuous tree usually hidden in  
 woods or confused with other tall     
 hedgerow growths.  Although not       
 related,because of its leaf shape,the 
 tree is sometimes mistaken for a      
 Maple. (It is a member of the         
 Whitebeam family.)  The leaves'  width
 usually being about the same as the   
 length.The upper surface of the leaves
 are smooth,shiny and dark green in    
 colour. Below they are paler.This tree
 grows slowly and reaches a great age. 
{ It is our duty to see that this rare 
{tree is protected and does not die out
{through our neglect and ignorance.}   </content>
