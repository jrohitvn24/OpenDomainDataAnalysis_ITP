		<title>10FOOTBALL CLUB,DUNVANT.</title>
		<content>{Dunvant &amp; Three Crosses Football Club}
 was founded in 1969 by parents to     
 cater for the boys  of both villages  
 who attended the school at Three      
 Crosses at that time.Although Dunvant 
 now has its own school,the Club is    
 still run for boys of both villages.  
 Six teams are being run at present for
 boys up to the age of 17 and one for  
 senior members.Apart from local league
 matches,tours are organised annually. 
 In recent years the Club's younger    
 members have formed a close friendship
 with the sons of American airmen based
 at Lakenheath in Suffolk.Reciprocal   
 visits and hospitality are arranged   
 culminating in matches between the    
 teams.                                
      Five former members of the Club  
 are now professional footballers.
