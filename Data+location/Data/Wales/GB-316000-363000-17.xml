		<title>17Cilcain Pupils' Life-Styles</title>
		<content> A survey of the juniors at Cilcain    
 School showed that most pupils have a 
 bicycle, but that generally they walk 
 to school or are brought by car.      
 Most keep pets at home: dogs and cats 
 are most popular, with rabbits and    
 fish heading a list of others. All    
 homes had colour television, with a   
 majority also having a video-recorder.
 The school has a micro-computer, but  
 75% also have a computer at home. The 
 pupils have a wide range of interests.
 About half are members of the Scout or
 Guide movements. Most popular sporting
 pursuits are swimming (nearly all can 
 swim), football and riding. About 50% 
 have travelled abroad and also flown  
 in an aeroplane, generally on holidays
 to Europe. The children enjoy the     
 friendliness and freedom of life in   
 this small rural community and the    
 peace and beauty of the countryside.  </content>
