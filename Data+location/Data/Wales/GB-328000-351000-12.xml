		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN TANYFRON</title>
		<content>                                       
       {Tanyfron}has a very small but  
 close knit Community.At one time the  
 majority of the men would have been   
 employed either at one of the coal    
 mines which existed in the Wrexham    
 area or at the local{Brymbo}          
{Steelworks,}which specialises in the  
 production of high grade steel.The    
 steelworks was extended in the early  
 1980's at a cost of approximately Â£50 
 million which has helped secure its   
 place as a major steel producing plant
 in the country.                       
                                       
       There are two or three slag     
 heaps in the area of Tanyfron which   
 lays claim to the fact that this      
 particular set of squares lies on the 
 North Wales coalfield.
