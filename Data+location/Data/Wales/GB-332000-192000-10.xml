		<content>   The Hall was provided by Pontypool  
 Rural District Council and officially 
 opened on 30th April 1966. Many areas 
 of recreation take place here such as 
 badminton, disco, sewing classes. Lots
 of childrens parties are held here.   
 Outside the hall is a park. It has    
 swings and slides. Each year a fete is
 held here to raise money for the      
 village organisations. There is a     
 playing field near the school and the 
 village soccer and cricket teams use  
 it. A new pavillion was opened in 1984
