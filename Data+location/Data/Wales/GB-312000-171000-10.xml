		<title>10St.Andrew's Quarry</title>
		<content> The limestone rock was first excavated
 by hand.   It was used in the building
 of Barry Docks and older houses in the
 Dinas Powys area.   During the 17th   
 Century a rocky outcrop above the     
 quarry became the favourite seat of   
 Hugh LLoyd after he was replaced as   
 Rector of St.Andrew's Church during   
 the Commonwealth.   This became known 
 as {'Cadair Yr Esgob'}(The Bishop's   
 Seat) as LLoyd became Bishop of       
 LLandaff after the Restoration.   This
 century the quarry closed down due to 
 bankruptcy.   Presently the site is   
 used as a landscape gardening centre  
 but there are plans to re-open it as a
 quarry.   Public opposition has       
 delayed this due to the large amount  
 of heavy traffic the quarry would     
 generate to pass through the centre of
 Dinas Powys.                          
                                       </content>
