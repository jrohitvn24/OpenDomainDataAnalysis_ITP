		<content> The chief occupation is upland hill   
 sheep farming with store and dairy    
 cattle on the valley floor.  Farms    
 tend to be scatteredd, with small     
 population,mainly populated by people 
 working on the area, the farms are    
 generally family  farms with the      
 eldest son inheriting the property and
 remaining siblings finding work       
 elsewhere, outside the area           
 A few professional people live localy 
 and commute to their employment. The  
 land rises steeply  from the valley   
 bottom (146m&lt;409m) and in square 1    
 there is a lake which is used by      
 terns for a breeding area
