		<title>18Llanrhychwyn Church</title>
		<content> The church lies at the eastern edge of
 the upland country west of the valley,
 east of Llyn Geirionydd 25Om high. The
 church was originally a small         
 rectangular building, possibly 12th   
 cent., and known traditionally as     
 Llywelyn's church and may have been   
 used by Llywelyn ap Iorwerth before   
 Trefriw church was built. The font is 
 possibly older than the church itself.
 Small and square in shape, it may date
 from 11th or 12th cent.The bell is    
 14th cent. and probably came from     
 Maenan Abbey.The gravestones are of   
 very special interest, and were       
 included in a recent project to record
 gravestones carried out by the Womens 
 Institute Trefriw.The church is in use
 during spring and summer months       
 attended by local people and visitors.
 During 1984/5 weddings &amp; christenings 
 have been celebrated here.            </content>
