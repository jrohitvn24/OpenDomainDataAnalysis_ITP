		<content> Alyn Fish Farm,started by Tom &amp; Janet 
 Morgan in 1978,is situated on the A541
 at Cefnybedd.                         
 Mr.Morgan and an assistant work full  
 time at the farm which now has its own
 hatchery fed by warm water from an    
 energy saving, natural, gravity fed   
 borehole.Water from the River Alyn    
 supplies the fish tanks,which now     
 contain between seventy and eighty    
 thousand pellet fed {female}trout of  
 varying sizes,which are kept for      
 between eight and twelve months before
 being sold,either as table fish or    
 smoked trout,mainly to local people or
 to hotels and restaurants in the      
 Wrexham and Chester region.           
 Despite problems such as river{       
 pollution,fish disease and long       
 working hours,Mr.Morgan will increase 
 capacity to allow for bulk {trade}to  
 Manchester and London.                </content>
