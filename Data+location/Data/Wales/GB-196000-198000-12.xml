{Community Council,}it was reported    
 that various letters had been received
 about the zinc fence road.            
  It was decided to write to{Dyfed     
{County Concil}asking if the path could
 be downgraded from a bridleway to a   
 footpath.                             
  The clerk was asked to write to the  
 county council's highways department  
 requesting the repair of the road     
 outside Brynheulog House,and the      
 repair of the stop-cock outside 3     
 Bentlass Road,which was damaged when  
 the road was re-surfaced.It was       
 mentioned that the road surface at    
 North Lodge,and the stretch between   
 Mellaston and North Lodge,was in need 
 of repair.
