 Here are some games we play at        
 breaktimes:                           
                                       
{Hide and Seek}                        
   When I play hide and seek somebody  
 is 'on it'. They have to count to 100.
 Meanwhile the players run and hide.   
 When the one 'on it' has found us all 
 we start another game.                
                                       
{London}                               
   One person stands at the bottom of  
 the yard and any number of people     
 stand at the top of the yard. The     
 person who is 'on it' turns around,   
 hiding her eyes, and spells out {     
{L-O-N-D-O-N.}While this is going on   
 the rest run and as soon as the person
 'on it' turns round everyone has to   
 stand as still as statues. If anyone  
 is caught moving they are out.        </content>
