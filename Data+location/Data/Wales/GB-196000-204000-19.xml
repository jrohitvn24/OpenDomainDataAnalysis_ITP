		<title>19BURTON V.C. SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Our school was established in{1844. 
 Then it was a large stone building,   
 with a house attached, where the{Head 
{Teacher}lived. It still has the old   
 buildings; but two mobile classrooms  
 have been added and the school house  
 is empty.                             
   It is a{Junior/Infants Mixed School 
 with{99 pupils.}The age range is 4-11 
 and when we leave we go to a{Secondary
{School.}There are four classes each   
 with its respective teacher:{Miss     
{John,}Reception;{Mrs. Smith,}Infants; 
{Mrs. Llewhellin,}Junior 1 and 2;{Mr.  
{Devonald,}the  Headmaster, Junior 3   
 and 4.                                
   There is a School Canteen where     
 meals are cooked.                     
   We have a large playground and a    
 extensive grassy area and copse.
