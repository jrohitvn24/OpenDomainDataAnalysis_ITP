		<title>10Llandudno: Historical (2)</title>
		<content>{  The Chester to Holyhead railway}was 
 built in 1848 with a{branch line to   
{Llandudno}in 1858. The first pier was 
 constructed in 1858, but was destroyed
 by a severe storm a year later.  The  
{present pier,}2,295 feet long and con-
 sidered to be one of the finest       
 examples of a{typical Victorian pier, 
 was built in 1876.  In 1878 work was  
 begun on a roadway, the{Marine Drive  
 which now encircles the Gt.Orme.      
   Llandudno is associated with the    
 well-known story of{Alice in Wonder-  
{land,}to which the{White Rabbit statue
 on the West Shore bears witness. Alice
 Liddell, whose father was so fond of  
 the area that he built a summer house 
 in the town, inspired the Rev.C.L.    
 Dodgson, better known as the author,  
{Lewis Carroll,}to produce his literary
 masterpiece.
