		<title>09JAZZ BANDS IN SWANSEA</title>
		<content>   Many children here belong to jazz   
 bands. These originated in the miners'
 strike of 1926, when many of the men  
 channelled their energy into dressing 
 up and parading the streets.          
   Now children carry on the tradition,
 competing for the honour of being     
 champion band in colourful uniforms,  
 often with a military flavour. The    
 training is rigorous, - strict weekly 
 practices in countermarching, playing 
 their kazoos (a 'comb-and-paper' type 
 instrument) and drumming.             
   Each band is linked to a specific   
 area, - e.g., Clase Silver Crystals.  
 In competitions, each band executes a 
 complicated 12 min. programme under   
 the gaze of 6 judges, who assess the  
 precision of the marching, the skill  
 of the baton-twirling majorette, the  
 music and the drumming. It is a proud 
 band which carries its trophies home! </content>
