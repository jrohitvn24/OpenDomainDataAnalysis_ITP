		<title>11A Typical School Day.</title>
		<content> My name is Daniel Powell, and I attend
 Victoria Primary School. I get up at  
 about 7:50 and wash and dress. At 8:10
 I have breakfast of cereal and toast, 
 and then brush my teeth and pack my   
 bag ready for school. At 8:40 a friend
 calls and we walk to school, we arrive
 at about 8:50 and chat or play until  
 the bell goes at 9:00.                
   School begins with assembly in the  
 hall upstairs. After this we return to
 the classroom and begin our lessons.  
 We do maths before morning play and   
 language after. Our lunch hour begins 
 at 12:00 when we have the choice of   
 having school meals, packed lunches,  
 or going home for dinner.             
   The afternoons are varied and on    
 Friday afternoon we begin with Welsh  
 followed by reading, then after break 
 we have games until it is time to go  
 home at 3:30.                         </content>
