		<title>10Pre War Housing in Locality</title>
		<content> The houses along the Narberth Road are
 a mixture of Victorian,Edwardian,Post 
 World War I and Post world WarII.The  
 elder buildings have now been turned  
 either into hotels or guest houses.The
 modern Post World WarII are private.On
 the North side of the Norton are      
 terraced cottages built in Victorian  
 times for workmen. The croft houses,  
 all without exception,are now hotels, 
 were originally intended as desirable 
 residences for the wealthy people of  
 the town.One of the popular pastimes  
 on a Sunday,up to the commencement of 
 World War I was after Church promenade
 along this road.                      
  Leading from the Croft we come to    
 North cliff with three Victorian      
 houses and a private housing estate,  
 built during the mid 1950's.These     
 houses have superb views over the sea 
 and adjoining coast.                  </content>
