 I live at{Partridge Way.} The design  
 of the house is good.  The bedrooms   
 are square, rectangular and           
 triangular.  In a three bedroom house 
 there two big bedrooms and one small  
 one.  The kitchens are big, the living
 rooms are quite big.  The hall way is 
 medium.  At the back of my house there
 is a wood, a big grass area and our   
 school.  There are not many playing   
 places in {Partridge Way. }There used 
 to be a fort there.  It is now a      
 playing field.  There is only one big 
 and good park which is in {Sandpiper  
{Way.} More places and parks should be 
 built for little children to play in. 
      There are a thousand houses on   
 the {Duffryn Estate.} This estate won 
 a design award when it opened in 1976.
