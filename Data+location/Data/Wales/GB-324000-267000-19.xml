		<content> LANDSCAPE.The area is intensively     
 farmed and hedged fields reach almost 
 to the highest land (400m) with much  
 of the land used for grazing.Buildings
 are attractive and old apart from the 
 modern crude barns that have appeared.
 The hills in the south have conifer   
 plantations on the lower flanks but   
 not to any great degree.              
 ECOLOGY.There has been little tendency
 to remove hedges and enlarge fields   
 with the result that habitats are not 
 destroyed. The upper hills are largely
 natural and unspoilt though the       
 tendency in recent times to make roads
 onto the highest hills is making the  
 continued wildness less certain.      
 Wildlife is plentiful - buzzard,      
 rabbit. fox, owls, partridge are all  
 common and the river is clean and not 
 polluted.
