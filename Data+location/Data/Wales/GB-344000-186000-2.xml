		<content> One mile West of{Caldicot}on the B4245
 is the Village of{Rogiet.}Early in the
 nineteenth century it was just a small
 agricultural hamlet with a population 
 of 35. There are now about 1,400      
 inhabitants. During the latter half of
 the 19th century the railway came with
 the opening of the{Severn Tunnel}in   
 1886. A large marshalling yard        
 developed at the junction just south  
 of Rogiet. Many local men are still   
 employed by British Rail.             
    Footpaths run from the village out 
 into the country and down to the      
 Caldicot Levels. There are playing    
 fields and allotments and the Severn  
 Wildfowlers shoot over the land and   
 shore of the{Severn Estuary.
