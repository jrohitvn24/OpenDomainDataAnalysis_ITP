 There is a Way Marked "Usk Valley     
 Footpath" along the River Usk, across 
 an area called "The Island", through  
 Agricultural College land to a disused
 and derelict cornmill, Prioress Mill, 
 then passing Llancayo and a ruined    
 Windmill on the other side of the     
 river. Another signed foothpath goes  
 from the Castle Lane, past Castle Farm
 to Gwehelog, with a branch going      
 through Cwm Cayo Wood down to the     
 Abergavenny Road by Beech Hill Farm.  
 Some foothpaths in the rural area are 
 used by Ramblers as part of long      
 walks, but some are not now used as   
 local short cuts, and are falling into
 disuse.  The weather in this area is  
 not extreme, but heavy rainfall       
 upstream causes the River Usk to rise 
 quickly and flood.  The Flood         
 Alleviation Scheme, completed recently</content>
