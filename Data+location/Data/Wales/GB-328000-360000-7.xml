		<content>  The area does not have a shopping    
 precinct as such but a few general    
 stores which sell vegetables,tin      
 foods,dairy products etc.There are no 
 restaurants or cafes in the village   
 but a single fish and chip shop.      
  A small rather shabby{Post Office}   
 sells cards, papers, stamps and people
 can also obtain money and pensions    
 from there.In addition every Thursday 
 a mobile library visits the town.     
  People visiting the surrounding      
 countryside may stay overnight at a   
 hotel, from the outside it seems very 
 large.An odd co-op retail store has   
 been redeveloped into a freezer       
 centre.The newest facility in the area
 is the video shop.There are lots of   
 nurseries spread around the area and  
 there is a flower shop and a Turkey   
 farm situated on the a 550.
