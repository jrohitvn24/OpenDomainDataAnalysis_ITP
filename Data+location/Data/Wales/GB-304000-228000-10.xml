		<title>10Brecknock Museum.</title>
		<content>     Brecknock Museum is  housed in the
 original Shire Hall of the  old County
 of  Brecknock  built in  1842. In this
 building the regular Assize Court took
 place.When the  organisation  of local
 goverments  took  place  in  1974, the
  building  became  an  award  winning 
 museum.                               
    The original museum became known in
 1928. It  was opened  by Lady Buckland
 on the 1'st of March. It was housed in
 the old disused Congregational  Chapel
 in Glamorgan Street.  Sir  John Conway
  Lloyd,  a  distinguished  gentleman  
 antiquarian and enthusiasm brought the
 museum  into  being. Many local people
 gave gifts and  bequests,  one  of the
 first items  being  the  8'th  century
 canoe  dug out  of Llangorse  Lake and
  given  by  Lord  Glanusk. The  modern
 museum today  has 3 floors and in 1985
 was completely redecorated.           </content>
