		<title>17The Old Telephone Exchange</title>
		<content> In June 1985 we visited the Pontypridd
 exchange.First of all we went to the  
 cable chambers.In one thick cable     
 there are thousands of other cables.  
 There were about ten thick cables     
 there.This exchange was built in      
 1958,it is out of date now.When we    
 went upstairs we saw big batteries,for
 use in a power cut.Only eight people  
 work there now,but in the past thirty 
 people worked there.For a local call  
 it costs 5p every three minutes,but if
 you call abroad it costs 5p every six 
 seconds.They work out how much you    
 need to pay for your bill by using    
 meters which are photographed every   
 three months.They have faults in every
 100 calls.All the people who work     
 there work five days a week from 8    
 till 4.15,a total of thirty-seven and 
 a half hours each week.
