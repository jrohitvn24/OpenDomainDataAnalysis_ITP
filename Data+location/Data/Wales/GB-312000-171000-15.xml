		<title>15The Manor of Michaelston</title>
		<content> The origin of the manor is somewhat   
 obscure, it was a sub_manor of the    
 Lordship of Dinas Powys, being formed 
 by grants made by the holders of the  
 Knight's fees. Walter de Reigny was   
 the first Lord of the manor of        
 Michaelston to be recorded, about     
 1250_80. Although this is the first   
 instance in which the manor appears,  
 it formed part of the de Reigny estate
 and was united with Wrinstone, the    
 manor house of which also served      
 Michaelston for many years.The        
 sub-manor of Michaelston was          
 approximately the same extent as the  
 parish of Michaelston-le-Pit.The manor
 passed through marriage to the Ralegh 
 family of Nettlecombe Court in        
 Somerset.Sir Simon de Ralegh made     
 Wrinstone his principal seat and the  
 Ralegh's were the first to erect a    
 substantial manor house on or near    </content>
