		<title>05The Games children play</title>
		<content>{British Bulldogs}is a game played     
 mostly by boys.To play the game,you   
 need a big,open space and any number  
 of children.The idea of the game is   
 for one person to stand in the centre 
 of the space and say,"British Bulldogs
 1,2,3.".Then the rest of the children 
 who are on the edge of the space must 
 run from one side to the other side   
 without letting the person in the     
 middle catch them.The game goes on    
 until everyone is caught.             
{                                      
{Three and In}is a popular game for    
 boys and girls.It starts when one     
 child is in goals and the other       
 children have to score three goals by 
 beating the other players and the     
 goalie. When one child scores three   
 goals he or she is in goals and the   
 game starts again.
