		<content> The schools of the area are of two    
 different types,the primary sector and
 the secondary sector.The primary      
 schools have their own catchment areas
 although one school being a Catholic  
 school,while another is a Church of   
 England school.                       
 Until very recently there was a school
 run by the nuns at the Convent.This   
 school was solely for girls of the    
 Catholic faith.                       
 The secondary school has a catchment  
 area well outside the study           
 area.All the schools follow abilingual
 policy whereby an equal amount of time
 is given to teaching through the      
 medium of Welsh and English.
