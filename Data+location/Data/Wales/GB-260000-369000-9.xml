		<content>     The cycle of grass cutting,slurry 
 spreading and eventual reseeding of a 
 field would carry on indefinitely     
 unless a farmer decided to change his 
 farming policy.                       
    The grass which the slurry is      
 spread over is used as winter feed for
 the cattle by making it into silage.A 
 few chemicals are added to the grass  
 as it is chopped and pumped           
 mechanically into one of the two silos
 at 100 mph.The 75ft.high silo on the  
 farm holds 600_700 tonnes of          
 silage.This feeds 130 cows for approx.
 7 months over a winter period.Mr      
 Williams uses 70 acres of his land    
 to produce silage.The grass is cut    
 twice a year usually in early June and
 towards the end of July.Silage is the 
 main crop at the farm similar to the  
 majority of farms in North Wales.
