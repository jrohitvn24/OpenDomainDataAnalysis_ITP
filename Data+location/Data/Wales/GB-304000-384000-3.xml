		<content> Many seabirds can be observed         
{offshore}from Prestatyn though they   
 are very often far out. Gannets,      
 Guillemots, Razorbills,Cormorants,    
 Kittiwakes,fulmars and the Gulls can  
 be seen at all times of the year      
 though their numbers do vary with     
 season and weather. (A few pairs of   
 fulmar nest sometimes at a disused    
 quarry.)In Summer terns can be seen as
 well as Manx Shearwaters. Autumn is   
 one the best times for seeing         
 seabirds, especially during gales from
 between West and North, Arctic        
 skuas,Bonxies and Leach's Petrels can 
 be seen.(Prestatyn is one of the best 
 spots in the country for seeing the   
 fairly rare Leach's Petrel.)In winter 
 Red-Throated Divers and Great Crested 
 Grebes occur and at most seasons      
 Shelducks,Common scoter and           
 Red_Breasted_Merganser can be seen.   </content>
