		<content> Most of my friends wear fashionable   
 clothes. The "in" colours are pastels,
 white, black and red. Ski-pants are   
 in fashion, they are like tights but  
 with a piece of material under the    
 foot. Lightweight jeans, very baggy   
 and rolled up just above the ankle are
 also in fashion. Another fashionable  
 piece of clothing is a white jacket   
 (not a zip up jacket) this should be  
 very baggy.                           
                                       
 During the winter suede coats were    
 very fashionable but not many people  
 had them because they were very       
 expensive.                            
                                       
 The fashionable things to wear        
 in your hair are brightly coloured    
 hair-grips with flowers or butterflys 
 on them. Every one dyes or streaks    
 their hair, streaks are most popular. </content>
