		<title>04A NEW SCHOOL IN RHYD Y FRO.</title>
		<content>    Last October a new school opened in
 Rhydyfro. The people of the village   
 had been promised this for a long     
 time.The old village school had grown 
 far too small and the access to it was
 dangerous.                            
   The new school is very different to 
 the other which was built over a      
 hundred years ago. It is a fine       
 building of red brick and sloping     
 roofs of tile.                        
   The Nursery is at the back of the   
 school and has its own entrance and   
 play area.Downstairs are the infant   
 and junior classrooms.In each of the  
 three classrooms, which are 50 metres 
 square, there are two teachers.       
   We now have many facilities which we
 did not have before - a large hall and
 gymnasium, a kitchen, a withdrawal    
 room, a kiva with rows of steps and a 
 large playing field.                  </content>
