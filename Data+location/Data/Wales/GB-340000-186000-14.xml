		<title>14SUPERNATURAL HELL'S POOL</title>
		<content>  Magor Church is an interesting place 
 to visit.On the south side,facing the 
 moor,there are big,strong             
 buttresses,and on the northern side   
 they are not so strong.This is because
 when the church was built,people were 
 very superstitious and believed that  
 there was a devil in a nearby pond on 
 the moor.                             
  They thought the devil would suck the
 church into the pool,this is one      
 reason why the pool is called "Hell's 
 Pool." It first got it's name of      
 "Hell's Pool" when Redwick Church     
 had a new bell,they had to cross the  
 moor with the bell,and as they were   
 crossing,the cart got caught in the   
 bog making the bell fall into the     
 pool,they blamed this on the          
 devil.Local people say that on a      
 cold,misty morning,if you hear the    
 bell,you will have bad luck.          </content>
