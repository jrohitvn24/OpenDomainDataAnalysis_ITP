		<content> Originally most of our block would    
 have been covered with woodland,      
 exclusively of the deciduous variety. 
 Today much of the original            
 afforestation has been cleared so that
 the land may be used for agricultural 
 purposes.However,the small woodland   
 glades,and the tree lined lanes add a 
 great deal to the character and beauty
 of the region.                        
             We decided to do a count  
 of the different varieties growing    
 within the block,and the number of    
 each type within a specific area i.e  
 Gaer Fawr Woods.                      
               On a lovely Summer's    
 evening we visited this excellent wood
 and using the pathways we counted the 
 number of each type of tree on either 
 side.In this way we gained an idea of 
 the variety,and number of species     
 present in the wood.                  </content>
