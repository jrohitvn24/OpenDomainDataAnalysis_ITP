		<content>   The Mumbles Coastguard Station is   
 built on Tutt Hill. From this         
 position, on a clear day, Devon can be
 seen on the other side of the Bristol 
 Channel. It is now the Headquarters   
 for the Swansea Search &amp; Rescue Region
 and covers an area from Ferryside in  
 Dyfed to the River Parrett in         
 Somerset.                             
   There are 13 regular Coastguards on 
 watch-keeping duties and the Station  
 is continually manned with 3 Officers 
 on duty at a time. They are assisted  
 by Auxiliary Coastguards.             
   The Station's equipment includes VHF
 Radios, Telex, a Computer and a great 
 number of books and charts for        
 information. Emergency services are   
 called out by Radio-Pager, or by      
 direct and public telephone systems.
