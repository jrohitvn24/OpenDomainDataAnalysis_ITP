		<content> At the side of the King George's      
 playing field there is a children's   
 playground. It has been open about a  
 year. The notice at the entrance says 
 that no children over eleven are      
 allowed inside. Dogs, bicycles and    
 vandals are also banned. A high metal 
 fence surrounds the park and the gate 
 is locked at 7 p.m. The area has been 
 grassed but there are wood shavings in
 places where children might fall and  
 where the ground becomes muddy. There 
 are wooden picnic tables, benches and 
 litter bins. There is a sand pit, a   
 wooden castle  with a ramp, a climbing
 frame, a roundabout and a slide. There
 are special swings for babies and also
 some rockers shaped like motor bikes  
 and birds. Children can spend a happy 
 time in this park.
