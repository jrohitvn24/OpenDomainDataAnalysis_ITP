 The village of Cil-y-cwm lies in the  
 Tywi Valley, 4 miles north of         
 Llandovery. The population of the     
 entire parish is less than 400.       
 although predominantly an agricultural
 area, forestry and tourism also make a
 valuable contribution to the area's   
 economy. Life revolves around a parish
 church, two chapels, a primary school,
 an old school which is used as a hall,
 and a pub. There is a small leather   
 business and an antique restoratin    
 enterprise. Although there is some    
 concern about the way forestry has    
 developed, the area may still be      
 described as virtually unspoilt. Large
 numbers of people come to Cil-y-cwm   
 for walking,fishing and to see the    
 wildlife, which includes the only     
 remaining red kites in the whole of   
 Britain. Once a stronghold            </content>
