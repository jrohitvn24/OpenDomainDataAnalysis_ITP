		<title>04Crymych choir.</title>
		<content> In my spare time I enjoy singing.I am 
 a member of Crymych choir.We practise 
 every Tuesday from 7.45 to 9.30 in    
 Preseli school hall.Lately we have    
 been practising twice a week as we    
 will be competing at the Cardigan     
 Eisteddfod next week and at the       
 National Eisteddfod the first week in 
 August.We shall be going to London in 
 October to sing as part of the        
 "Thousand Voices" in the Royal Albert 
 Hall.We have taken part before,in 1979
 and again 2 years ago.It was a        
 wonderful experience,one that I shall 
 remember for the rest of my life.In   
 1983,the choir was invited to go to   
 Camphere in Brittany to take part in a
 festival.I was chosen with seven other
 members of the choir to march and sing
 Welsh folk songs through the Breton   
 town.This was also a memorable        
 occasion.                             </content>
