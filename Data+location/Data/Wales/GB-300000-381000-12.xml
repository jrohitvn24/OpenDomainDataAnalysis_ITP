		<title>12LIFEBOAT RESCUES, RHYL</title>
		<content>  Rhyl's most famous rescue was in     
 September, 1962, when three men were  
 rescued seven minutes before the      
 pioneer Hovercraft which ran from Rhyl
 to Wallasey crashed into the sea wall.
 The R.N.L.I. presented the coxswain,  
 Mr. Campini, with a silver medal and  
 vellum to the rest of the crew.       
  During the summer months a smaller   
 inshore boat, carrying a crew of 2 or 
 3, is stationed at Rhyl for rescuing  
 holidaymakers from dinghies, lilo beds
 and yachts. Their numbers have        
 increased  considerably in the last   
 ten years. The annual number of call  
 outs is 15 to 20 but for the past two 
 years Rhyl has been the busiest       
 station on the North Wales coast. In  
 l984 there were 29 services and about 
 50 people were rescued and 30 of these
 were children.
