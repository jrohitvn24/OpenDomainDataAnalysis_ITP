		<title>05Railway Station,Pontypridd</title>
		<content> Pontypridd was once the heart of the  
 Taff Vale Railway.It was one of the   
 busiest railway centres in the British
 Isles but since 1970 the great days   
 have gone.The station now only has one
 passenger line although the two       
 mineral lines remain.At Pontypridd    
 signal box,just past the station, the 
 line divides in two:one line runs to  
 Merthyr Tydfil and the other runs up  
 the Rhondda valley to Treherbert.     
 Trains run hourly during the daytime  
 on both these lines.There is a regular
 service from Pontypridd to Cardiff.   
 Recently a brand new train,the        
 Sprinter 150,was seen in Pontypridd.  
 This is Britain's newest passenger    
 train.It means a faster journey,it is 
 quick but quiet.Maybe this train would
 make Pontypridd station busy again.
