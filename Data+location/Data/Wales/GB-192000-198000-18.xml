		<content> The excavation of the round cairn at  
 Corston Beacon was very exciting. The 
 cairn was a round pile of stones with 
 a flattish top. When the stones were  
 removed the excavators found a most   
 unusual burial. The grave was lined   
 with stone slabs and covered with     
 another about 2m. long. Only one      
 person had been buried in the grave.  
 All that was left were parts of the   
 thigh bones. The man must have been an
 important chief for there was a flat  
 knife or dagger, with holes showing   
 where it had once been riveted to a   
 handle of wood or bone, buried with   
 him. It was made of bronze, and is one
 of the earliest metal weapons ever    
 found in Wales. It is now in the      
 National Museum in Cardiff.
