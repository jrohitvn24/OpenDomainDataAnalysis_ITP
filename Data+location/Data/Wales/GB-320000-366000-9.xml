		<content> In this area there are two churches   
 and two chapels.  The two churches are
 Anglican churches and are in Rhydymwyn
 and Rhosesmor.  One of the chapels has
 closed down and the other one is a    
 chapel for Welsh people.  Both        
 churches have two services every      
 Sunday but the Welsh chapel has only  
 one.  Most of the people in the area  
 don't go to church.  The people who do
 go are mostly old people (over 60     
 years of age) and young children      
 (under 10 years of age).  The children
 who go to church go to Sunday School  
 but their parents never go to church. 
 Most people spend their Sundays at    
 home in the garden or go for a day    
 out.  They think that going to church 
 is a waste of time.
