		<title>17INTERVIEW - Mr. C.W.BORRETT</title>
		<content> As a child I remember hopscotch,      
 skipping, jackstones, marbles, conkers
 and cat and doggy. There were Saturday
 matinees at the cinema, 1d. entrance  
 and a bag of peanuts or a 'Monster'   
 bag of sweets for another 1d. Sunday  
 School was very popular especially the
 few weeks before Whitsun because on   
 Whit Monday all the Sunday schools    
 would join in procession through the  
 streets to show their strength. After 
 the parade there would be a free tea  
 party followed by a chapel eisteddfod 
 or 'sports'. I enjoyed reading The    
 Bible and Boys' Own books and novels  
 by Cooper, Verne and Dickens. I       
 remember Queen Elizabeth II's         
 coronation, my foster father, as      
 chairman of Glamorgan County Council  
 at the time, was invited.
