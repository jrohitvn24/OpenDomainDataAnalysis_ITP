		<content>  On the return of questionaires the   
 following concerns were stressed.     
{ HOUSING                              
 Council repairs mean tennants may have
 to be temporarily rehoused as far away
 as Brecon. Large protest seems to have
 changed this policy.                  
{ LIBRARY SERVICE                      
 Outcry that the part time library is  
 going to close. Mobile library thought
 to be unsuitable for the area. Plea to
 the B.B.C. through this survey.       
{ PUBLIC SERVICES                      
 There is much insecurity concerning   
 cuts in public services.              
{ EDUCATION                            
 Concern about cuts in the education   
 budget. (No mention of strikes!!!)    
{ LIFE STYLES                          
 Call for wholefood availability in the
 locality. No shops stock larger items 
 - must travel to Brecon or further.   </content>
