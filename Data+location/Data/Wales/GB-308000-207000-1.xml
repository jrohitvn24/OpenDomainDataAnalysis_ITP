		<title>01RHYMNEY LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> The town of Rhymney takes its name    
 from the river which rises in the     
 moorlands of Powys and  flows through 
 the valley entering the sea at        
 Cardiff.                              
   Rhymney,or Rhymni in  Welsh, is     
 divided into four distinct areas.These
 are: Blaen-Rhymni, Llechryd and       
 Rhymney which are                     
 situated at the top edge of the town  
 near the moorland and the Heads of the
 Valleys Road;Middle Rhymney  an area  
 of established commercial and         
 residential buildings and             
 finally Lower Rhymney, consisting of  
 council housing and industry. Founded 
 mainly as a result of its economic    
 position in the late 18th and 19th    
 centuries, it is a fairly typical     
 example 0f a Welsh valley town with   
 terraced houses, chapels and high     
 rainfall.                             </content>
