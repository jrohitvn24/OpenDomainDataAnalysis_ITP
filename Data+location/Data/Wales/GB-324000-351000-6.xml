		<content>  The school was opened in 1909 and was
 named Minera Council School.On the    
 first day 106 pupils attended.There   
 were four teachers including the      
 headmaster.Nearly all the children    
 were Welsh speaking.                  
  The building was of locally quarried 
 stone.It was in the shape of a        
 rectangle and the children were taught
 in three classes separated by wood    
 partitions.                           
  Today the school has 37 pupils aged  
 between four and eleven years.They are
 taught by the headteacher and an      
 infants' teacher.Not one of the       
 children comes from a Welsh speaking  
 home.                                 
  The school now has its own kitchen   
 and indoor toilets but there is no    
 assembly hall,Head's office or a room 
 for the teachers.There is a large     
 sloping yard and a playing field.     </content>
