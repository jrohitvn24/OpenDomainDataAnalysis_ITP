		<title>05WELSH LANGUAGE IN AMMANFORD</title>
		<content>  The total population of the Ammanford
 area (including Tycroes and Saron) in 
 1981 was approx. 10,500. Ammanford    
 having 5,562 and Tycroes and Saron    
 4,500. The total number of Welsh      
 speakers in urban Ammanford was 3,940 
 or 70.8%. Tycroes and Saron were      
 proportionally similar. Children under
 the age of 3 were not counted. The    
 approximate ages of Welsh speakers in 
 this area were mostly over 50 years of
 age. The education in Primary Schools 
 has been greatly improved - nearly all
 having Welsh speaking lessons in many 
 subjects. We have one primary school  
 which is all Welsh - most of the      
 children that leave here go to the    
 welsh band in the Amman Valley        
 Comprehensive School. Here in the     
 first band class we have History,     
 Geography and Religious Education in  
 Welsh.                                </content>
