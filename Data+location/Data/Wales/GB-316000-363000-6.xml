		<title>06Alyn Valley Wildlife (2)</title>
		<content> The importance of the Alyn valley     
 woodlands for wildlife has led to this
 particular locality along the river   
 being designated a 'Site of Special   
 Scientific Interest'                  
 The woods, old mines and buildings    
 provide roosting sites for bats.      
 Lately many disused mine-shafts in the
 area have been sealed in the interests
 of safety, but there has been concern 
 that this may in some cases have pre- 
 vented bats,now protected by law, from
 using roosting sites in old mines. The
 newly formed Clwyd Bat Group is hoping
 to give greater protection to known   
 bat roosts in the area.               
 Another conservation issue of concern 
 is the digging of badger setts, for   
 'badger-baiting' with dogs. Local     
 members of the Clwyd Badger Group are 
 helping to prevent the disturbance of 
 occupied setts.                       </content>
