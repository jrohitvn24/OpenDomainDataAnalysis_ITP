		<title>07  AN OLD BUCKLEY CUSTOM</title>
		<content> The Buckley Jubilee was started in    
 1856 by three men:Edward Davies,      
 Joseph Griffiths, and Richard Roberts.
 In 1956 a shield was brought to       
 celebrate the 100th birthday.The      
 Buckley Jubilee is, by tradition,held 
 on the second Tuesday of July.        
 Nowadays fifteen churches take part.  
 1985 was the 129th anniversary of the 
 festival.                             
 The Buckley Jubilee is a procession in
 which Churches and Sunday Schools take
 part and march through Buckley.It is  
 held to demonstrate our faith in God. 
 Before the procession a service is    
 held on the common.A different        
 minister leads it every year.Each     
 Sunday School or Church carries a     
 banner bearing its name.Many people   
 from all over the world come 'home'   
 for the Jubilee.
