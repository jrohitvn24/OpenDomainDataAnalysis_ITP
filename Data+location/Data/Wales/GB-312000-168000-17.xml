		<title>17Building Destruction</title>
		<content> Figuring prominently in this square is
 the 15 acre college site of what once 
 was the glamogan college of education 
 and which in 1974 became part of the  
 Polytechnic of Wales.  As it is no    
 longer used as an Educational         
 establishment - Mid Glamorgan county  
 council - who own the site have       
 decided to demolish the buildings and 
 sell the site to developers.  This    
 decision has been met with outrage by 
 conservationists,as is the proposed   
 destruction of the original college   
 building erected in 1914.  Barry      
 councillors maintain that the campus  
 could be used for conference          
 facilities and this legalised or      
 muiciapal vandalism should therefore  
 be prevented.  Many people feel that  
 if the college is demolished it would 
 be a sad day for everyone who had     
 taught or studied there.              </content>
