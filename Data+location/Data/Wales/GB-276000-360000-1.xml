		<title>01Description of the Area</title>
		<content>   This an area of great scenic        
 beauty,especially when viewed from the
 hills on either side of the glacier   
 valley,through which the river Conwy  
 flows. It includes land up to 350     
 metres above sea level, meadows for   
 hay and grazing, the market town of   
 Llanrwst and part of the village of   
 Trefriw. One large and several small  
 lakes are found in the hills in the   
 West. Conifer forests, natural        
 woodland, moorland and bogland are    
 interspersed with rocky outcrops. The 
 area is ideally suited to outdoor     
 pursuits but also provides scope for  
 farming both on the valley floor and  
 in the hills.                         
  It is a stronghold of the Welsh      
 language which is spoken and used in  
 teaching. A great many people speak   
 Welsh in their everyday affairs.
