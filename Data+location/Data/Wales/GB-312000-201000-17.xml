		<content> In our block we have many forests and 
 fields where a variety as wildlife    
 live. On a mountain opposite our      
 school we have 2 forests, 1 of these  
 is a forest of pines, planted to spell
 the word "JIF".Within this forest     
 buzzards and sparrowhawks, have nested
 as well as the usual variety of birds 
 such as Jackdaws, Crows, Blackbirds,  
 Finches etc. Rabbits &amp; Hares are quite
 common, as are foxes. Oaks and        
 sycamore are native to this district  
 as were the elms of 10 years ago.     
  In a recent line transect and        
 quadrant study at school we found     
 buttercups, thistles, nettles, daises,
 moss, ferns and clover as well as the 
 occational dock.
