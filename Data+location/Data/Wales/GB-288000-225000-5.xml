		<content> This is the sole economic activity    
 within the area.                      
 Because of the cool,wet climate there 
 are no crops other than grass and the 
 periodical sowing of swedes and rape  
 mixed with grass as winter fodder for 
 stock as part of the reseeding cycle. 
 The principal use to which the land is
 put is for rearing sheep for the fat  
 lamb market.                          
 There are some cattle, too, but the   
 area devoted to them is small compared
 with sheep. Any specialisation in     
 cattle is for beef animals.  There is 
 virtually no milk production within   
 the area.   Most of the farms         
 adjoining Fforest Fach have grazing   
 rights upon the hill.This is shared   
 between a large number of sheep and a 
 few small herds of mountain ponies. A 
 few ponies are sold each autumn and   
 these usually end up as pet food.     </content>
