		<content> or art.We leave school at 3.40pm.     
 I usually play in the park across the 
 road for a few minutes and I get home 
 at 4.00. I watch the childrens        
 programmes, then have tea which is    
 usually chips and beefburgers. At five
 o'clock I usually go out and play down
 the park by my house. I usually ask my
 mother to call me at 7.00 or 6.30 when
 I come up and watch television until  
 9.30. Then I may read, do some        
 tapestry, my homework or my piano or  
 guitar practice. After, I have supper 
 of baked beans and I usually go to    
 bed 10.00 and read a book. Sleep      
 eventually arrives about 11.00.
