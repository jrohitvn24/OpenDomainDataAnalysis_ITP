		<title>08MY HOBBIES ARE FOOTBALL...</title>
		<content>   I live in a village called{Pennard. 
 It has a few interesting aspects such 
 as a golf course, a beach and quite a 
 few clubs. I go to{Bishopston         
{Comprehensive School.}It is a bit like
 Alcatraz (nobody has escaped from it  
 yet!). My hobbies are football, break 
 dancing, scouts and soon I am hoping  
 to take up surfing. Football is my    
 main hobby and I play for an amazing  
 team called{Pennard Colts}(we have    
 only won 3 games this season). Break  
 dancing is a kind of acrobatic dancing
 with moves with very unusual names    
 such as Boston-caterpillar, Swallow-  
 dive and Moon-walk. Surfing is a very 
 difficult sport to do because you have
 to stand on a foam and fibre-glass    
 board on a wave.
