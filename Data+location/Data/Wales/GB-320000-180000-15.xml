 priest.{St Philip Evans}is fathers    
 third parish,but his first parish as

  A new catholic church was planned    
 by the Archdiocese when the area was  
 built.The actual architectural plans  
 were started about 3 years ago.The    
 original site of the church was going 
 to be Roundwood.                      
  {On June 2nd 1982,POPE JOHN PAUl 2nd 
 blessed the foundation stone.The      
 church was started on October 15th    
 1984 and the foundation stone was laid
