		<content> The most important roadway that serves
 the area is the B4309.At Five Roads it
 is crossed by an unclassified road    
 that was once used by cattle drovers. 
 West of the Gwendraeth Valley was the 
 road for transporting coal and        
 limestone to West Wales while the     
 section from the Gwendraeth Valley to 
 Llanelli linked the mining valley to  
 Llanelli.The fifth road rejoins the   
 B4309 at Cynheidre.The bus service is 
 run by The South Wales Bus Company who
 have reduced the service to a two     
 hourly service because of the drop in 
 passengers.The Llanelly and Mynydd    
 Mawr Railway never had a scheduled    
 passenger service apart from colliers'
 trains.Goods traffic has never        
 competed with road distribution yet   
 the line is a major artery into the   
 Llanelli hinterland.Road use today is 
 mainly commuter and tourist orientated</content>
