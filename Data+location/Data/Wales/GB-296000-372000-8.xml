		<title>08History,Religion Kinmel Hall</title>
		<content> This beautiful building stands in park
 land and was built a few hundred yards
 from the original Kinmel dating 1333. 
 The present building was erected in   
 1842, extended in 1871.  It has       
 survived a chequered life from being  
 the private home of various important 
 families, a Boys' School, Rheuma Spa  
 Military Hospital, Clinic, and a      
 Girls' School which ended with a disa-
 strous fire in 1975 when the building 
 was almost gutted.  Kinmel Hall was   
 leased by the owner to the Kinmel Hall
 Trust in 1979 and rebuilt at a cost of
 Â£2 million, funded by a business man  
 with property interests, the Welsh    
 Office and various grants. Most of the
 work was done by a small group of     
 Christian enthusiasts.  It is now a   
 Christian Conference Centre which can 
 accommodate 500 people.  It has all   
 the amenities of a 1st class hotel.   </content>
