		<title>12Social Life in Heolgerrig.</title>
		<content>  In Heolgerrig there is one club  and 
 two pubs. Many people attend this club
 just to drink, and have a game of     
 snooker or darts.The one thing that   
 the club has which is very useful is  
 the hall. This is used when there are 
 discos and parties held.The two pubs  
 are just drinking places.             
  The other main built up area in our  
 block is Clwydyfagwr which is half a  
 mile North West of Heolgerrig.There is
 one public house,this has only just   
 been built.It is called the Twyncarmel
 Inn.Also there is another pub on      
 Swansea Road called the Harp Inn,this 
 has a lounge where you can have a     
 meal, and is useful for people living 
 in the Gellideg area.
