		<title>17BRITISH RAIL ABERDYFI</title>
		<content>    Aberdyfi lies on the Machynlleth to
 Pwllheli section of the{Cambrian Coast
{Railway.}The present village is served
 by two unstaffed stations.            
    Opened in 1867 and absorbed into   
 the G.W.R.in 1924 the line has never  
 been very busy:                       
          {YEAR.      No.TRAINS/DAY.   
{         }1869          8             
           1904         14             
           1943         11

 Maintenance costs exaggerated by the  
 gradual subsidence of the Barmouth    
 Viaduct has meant that during recent  
 years there has been a question mark  
 over the lines future.However,a       
 modernisation programme involving     
 radio signalling and the new Class 150
{SPRINTER}in 1986 suggests a certain   
 commitment to the future but only time
 will tell.                            </content>
