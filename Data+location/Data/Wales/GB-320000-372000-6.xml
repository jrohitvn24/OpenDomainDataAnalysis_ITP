		<title>06Punks</title>
		<content> Punks are normally seen with mohican  
 haircuts, spiked often brightly dyed  
 hair. They use hair gel or egg to make
 their hair stand on end. Their clothes
 vary but in the area I live there are 
 two girls who dress in the same kind  
 of gear. One has shaved her head      
 around the sides and fluffed up her   
 hair so as she looks like an orange   
 tree. I have seen her wearing black   
 cotton dungarees, a man's pyjama top  
 dyed orange, orange socks and tiny    
 black boots. Her friend wears the same
 kind of clothes.                      
                                       
 Some punks dress in leather clothes   
 and chains. I think punks' clothes are
 really nice and would like to wear    
 them. Adults, like my parents aren't  
 too sure about punks though so I have 
 to dress like everyone else.
