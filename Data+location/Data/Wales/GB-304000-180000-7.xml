		<content>{TRANSPORT:}Open Dec. '77 built to     
 strict{Dept. of Environment}Standards.
 Three lanes both directions, with slip
 roads making up intersection with new 
 Cardiff Rd. extension into Talbot     
 Green. It is mid point between Cardiff
 to the east and Pencoed to the west.  
{IMPACT:}Turned the area into commuting
 and residential zone within reach of  
 Cardiff, Newport and Swansea; and has 
 attracted much new industry such as   
 the Royal Mint.                       
{DESIGN:}Pre-stressed concrete arches  
 and girders making up wide span       
 bridges with dramatic cuttings and    
 embankments. Already subsidence       
 causing concern.                      
{TRAFFIC COUNT:}Taken over 15 mins.    
 Over 300 vehicles in each direction of
 which 230 were cars and 60 were H.G.V.
 travelling at{high}speeds in all three
 lanes.                                </content>
