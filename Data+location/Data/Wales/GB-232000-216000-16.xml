		<title>16Housing.</title>
		<content> Ours is a very rural area and many of 
 the houses are stone built farm       
 houses,many of these have been        
 modernised in the last few years.Often
 these homes are isolated,having long  
 approach lanes.                       
 There are no tower blocks and very few
 flats.Eventhough there are two small  
 council built housing estates in the  
 block,many of the houses have now been
 bought by the previous tenants.       
 Several new homes have been built     
 recently,many of these are bungalows. 
 There are very few people living in   
 caravans or mobile homes and a high   
 percentage of families own or are     
 buying their homes.                   
 As many of the farms are family owned 
 retired farmers hand over their farms 
 to their sons and build themselves    
 bungalows on the land.
