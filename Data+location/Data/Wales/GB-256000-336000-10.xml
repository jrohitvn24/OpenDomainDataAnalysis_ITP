		<content> Few houses in the area pre-date the   
 construction of the Cob(1811).In the  
 town are terraced streets of stone-   
 built houses all with slate roofs.In  
 the villages new estates have sprung  
 up,some being bungalows with open-plan
 gardens and others with semi-detached 
 and detached houses.These houses and  
 bungalows are privately owned,many of 
 them being holiday homes for people   
 out of the area.All of the houses in  
 the area have slate roofs.What other  
 material could be used in the once    
 slate-exporting capital of the        
 world? There are also some council    
 estates that have been built in the   
 town.Some of the houses there are     
 privately owned and some council      
 owned.The urban decay usually         
 associated with old property has been 
 averted by modernisation encouraged by
 council grants.                       </content>
