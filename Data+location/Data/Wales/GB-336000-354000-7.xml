		<title>07TREVALYN HALL</title>
		<content> The area around {Trevalyn Hall}used to
 be a great forest.Some of the trees   
 were cleared to provide an open space;
 in other words a field.It was in this 
 field that the family known as{Alla}or
{All}established their{'ton'}(this     
 means settlement).The word {ing}meant 
 'family' and so the name{Allington}was
 formed meaning the settlement of the{ 
 'All(a)' family.                      
 The word {Trevalyn}is the Welsh word  
 for{Allington.}                       
 Sir John Trevor built Trevalyn Hall   
 in 1457 in the reign of Queen         
 Elizabeth II .It was built for lady   
 Trevor Jones to live in.Trevalyn Hall 
 is an E shaped Mansion.               
 Trevalyn Hall has now been converted  
 into three flats where people live.   
 Some people say that there are a few  
 ghost stories around Trevalyn Hall.
