		<content> There are different parties in        
 politics.  To see which party rules   
 the country there has to be an        
 election in which the people vote for 
 the party they want to get into       
 power.The leader of the party which   
 gets into power is the Prime Minister.
 That person has to form a cabinet.    
                                       
 There are County Councils and District
 Councils all working for the          
 Government.  The County Council is in 
 charge of the County and employs the  
 council workmen, such as the dustbin  
 men.  They also run the hospitals and 
 all the people who work for the       
 public.   The District Council sees to
 things like council houses, if the    
 tenants have any complaints.
