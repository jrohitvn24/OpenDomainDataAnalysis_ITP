		<title>18Game in the Llangybi area</title>
		<content> The  Llangybi Estate lets its shooting
 rights to a Sporting Syndicate.The    
 tennant keeper puts out to Estate     
 woods ang grounds each year           
 approximately 11 thousand pheasants,a 
 thousand mallard and a thousand       
 partridge.                            
 There has been organised shooting in  
 this area for a number of years so the
 wild pheasant population has built up 
 quite substantially. Most of the      
 mallard in the area,when old enough   
 fly from the small streams and ponds  
 they were originally put on,fly down  
 to Llangybi bottoms and the River     
 Usk.There are also a number of hares  
 in the area,which live on the flat    
 pasture land adjacent to the river. On
 Several occasions,roe deer have been  
 seen in Llantrisant.They have come    
 down into the area from Wentwood      
 Forest.                               </content>
