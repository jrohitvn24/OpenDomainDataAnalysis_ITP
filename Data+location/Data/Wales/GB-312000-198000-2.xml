		<content> CAPEL GWLADYS                         
 The earliest church buildings at CAPEL
 GWLADYS were probably built on old    
 pagan sites. The site of the chapel   
 was discovered in 1906. A low stone   
 wall, 30cms high, was built around the
 perimeter forming  rectangle 13.5m. by
 7.2m. Eventually, the remains of a    
 circular wall were detected around the
 site at a distance of 24m. from it.   
 These  circular wall traces show that 
 the area had been a sacred enclosure  
 of importance in the past.            
 PONT CARADOG                          
 Caradog exists in Celtic song/legend. 
 PONT CARADOG commemorates his name.   
 Although the original bridge has      
 collapsed, the stone used still       
 exists. The site was really an 11th   
 century pack-horse bridge (an ancient 
 Silurian and Roman ford crossing the  
 River Darren).                        </content>
