		<content> The roads around our area,although    
 classed as'A' roads are quite narrow  
 with many bends.Often large vehicles  
 have to slow down or even stop in     
 order to pass.In winter, the roads are
 very quiet but there is a marked      
 difference in summer because of       
 tourists.Because  public transport    
 does not offer a frequent service,    
 local people have to rely on private  
 cars.                                 
 The bus service offers 6 buses a day -
 3in each direction.The trains run more
 frequently with 9 trains running each 
 way but this service even does not    
 satisfy all our needs. Few people     
 generally travel on bikes or on public
 transport.Most people who go shopping 
 or travel to work rely on cars.       
   The 1981 census showed that 27% of  
 households in the village were with   
 out cars.                             </content>
