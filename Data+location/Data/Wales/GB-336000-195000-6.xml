		<title>06Llangybi_ Best Kept Village</title>
		<content> In July 1985 Llangybi was again judged
 Best Kept Village in Gwent in the     
 Small Village category,winning Â£50.00.
 Over the last twenty years Llangybi   
 has often won,using the prize money to
 set up a notice board,seat,litter bins
 and flower beds.The best kept village 
 plaque is erected in a border by the  
 shop.                                 
 The older cotages cluster round the   
 green with its central oak.The        
 attractive gardens have copper        
 beech,quick thorn or privet hedges.The
 new houses are mainly open plan with  
 many trees while the back gardens of  
 the pensioner's houses are shielded by
 high black fencing.There are several  
 open areas but no playing field,but   
 the Community Council hope to develope
 the former school field.
