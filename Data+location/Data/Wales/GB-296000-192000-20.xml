		<content>    The recent years have seen a       
 dramatic and significant change in the
 population of this area.  A decline of
 18.35% (some 1,730 people) occurred   
 between 1961-1971, this trend still   
 continues.  The majority of the       
 decline was experienced in the 0 - 14 
 and 15 - 44 male and female age       
 groups, the numbers of which fell by  
 20% and 31% respectively.  An increase
 in the population over retirement age 
 was also noticed.  The decline in     
 population is accounted for by lower  
 fertility rates than e.g. the rest of 
 Mid-Glamorgan and by the rate of mig- 
 ration from the valley.  This decline 
 is manifested in a falling school pop-
 ulation and an increase on demand e.g.
 on care provision for the elderly. The
 last official figures gave this area a
 population of 7698 which represents   
 some 8.65% of the total pop.of Rhondda</content>
