		<title>14SHOPPING SURVEY IN MT. ASH</title>
		<content> In a survey of shopping in Montain    
 Ash,we discovered many facts about    
 habits of shopping in the town.Most   
 of the shoppers were local,having come
 no more than 2 miles and either walked
 or made use of public transport.Many  
 tended to shop about twice a week     
 usually on a Friday(when there is an  
 open air market)or Saturday and spent 
 an average of 1to 2 hours in the town.
 Most of the shopping was for food or  
 other general household items.        
 The majority of people questioned     
 considered Mountain Ash to be a poor  
 shopping centre, and for clothes or   
 larger household items, they travelled
 to other towns such as Aberdare or    
 Pontypridd or even into the city of   
 Cardiff about 20 miles away.
