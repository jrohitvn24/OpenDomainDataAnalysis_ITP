		<title>03Farming in Stackpole</title>
		<content>   A combination of last year's surplus
 crops,cheap imports and a disastrously
 poor summer are all reasons for the   
 poor state of the industry.Growing    
 potatoes is especially important to   
 the local economy,because the mild    
 climate enables them to be planted and
 harvested earlier than in other parts 
 of the British Isles.                 
   Sheep are also brought down in the  
 winter by the hill farmers of the     
 Preseli area to graze in the warmer   
 climate of the Stackpole region.The   
 rent accruing from this practice is a 
 valuable addition to the local        
 farmers' income.                      
   The grain grown locally is of a poor
 quality and can only be used as cattle
 food; this is because the climate is  
 too wet.                              
   All the farmers are tenants, the    
 land is owned by an insurance trust.  </content>
