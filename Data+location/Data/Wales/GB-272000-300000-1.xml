		<title>01Machynlleth and Dyfi valley</title>
		<content>  The market town of Machynlleth rests 
 on the river Dyfi which is crossed via
 an old arched bridge. Trout and even  
 salmon are still quite plentiful. The 
 surrounding area is predominantly a   
 mixture of cultivated and uncultivated
 farming land, some of which has been  
 pruchased by the Forestry Commision.  
 There are a few small industries but  
 the two main ones are agriculture and 
 tourism the latter applying more to   
 late spring and summer which turns the
 character and quiet nature of the area
 into an exciting and bustling place.  
 there are several interesting and     
 historical buildings. Notably amongst 
 these are Owain Glyndwr Senate House  
 The Town Clock and the Plas (Mansion) 
 Although the area, in recent years    
 has become more anglicised, Welsh     
 remains an importnt and much used     
 language for business and community   </content>
