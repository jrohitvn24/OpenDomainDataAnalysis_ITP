		<title>11Children at the Eisteddfod</title>
		<content>   Local children were fully involved  
 in the{National Eisteddfod,}an event  
 held alternately in{North}and{South   
{Wales}in{August,}because this year it 
 was only a few miles away near{Rhyl.  
   Children from our block attending   
{Heulfre, Twm o'r Nant and Llanrhaedr  
 schools met regularly to practise folk
 dancing.Large rehearsals took place   
 in Rhyl with dancers from other local 
 areas. The dances were performed on   
 Rhyl{promenade}to welcome visitors and
 give them an early taste of{eisteddfod
 activities. Dressed up in traditional 
 Welsh costumes and parading under sch-
 -ool banners we presented a colourful 
 spectacle.We took part in a children's
 musical{'Heidi-ho'}which in its finale
 had over{300}on stage. Some local     
 children were a great hit at the      
 opening ceremony with their sparkling 
 display in a light hearted review.    </content>
