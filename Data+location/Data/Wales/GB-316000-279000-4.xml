		<title>04PLACE-NAMES IN BEGUILDY</title>
		<content>  The Welsh language became almost     
 extinct in this area well over a      
 hundred years ago. It is on record    
 that two hundred years ago the demand 
 for Welsh was so limited that a Welsh 
 service once a month at the Parish    
 Church met the requirements of the    
 parishioners. However, though the     
 Welsh language ceased to be used in   
 the parish so long ago, the names of  
 the hills, fields and farms are still 
 retained in pure Welsh. Beguildy is an
 anglicised form of the Welsh name     
  " Bugeildy" which means "Shepherd's  
 House", an obvious reference to the   
 main occupation of the villagers. Many
 farm names are Welsh although some    
 pronunciations are English "Llanllwyd"
 means "Greychurch", "Carreg-y-Frain"  
 means"Crows' Stone" and "Cwmbugail" is
 translated as "Shepherd's Valley".    
 Most of the hills have Welsh names.   </content>
