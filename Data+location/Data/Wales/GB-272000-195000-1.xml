		<content> General View of Block.                
 The block in question is mostly       
 covered by the River Neath tidal      
 marsh.As a result it is far too       
 dangerous an area to study with       
 children.However,the area is          
 surrounded by hills,at the base of    
 which is a continous urban sprawl.This
 urban area consists of the town of    
 Neath and the villages of Skewen and  
 Briton Ferry.                         
 Most of the work in this project will 
 be based on this urban area and was   
 completed by schools situated here.The
 schools are Alderman Davies Junior    
 School,Coedffranc Junior School,Melin 
 Junior School and Ynysmaerdy Junior   
 School.                               
 The work in general looks at the way  
 in which people have affected the area
 in the past and the present.
