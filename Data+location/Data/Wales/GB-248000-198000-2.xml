		<title>02Overview of Llanelli.</title>
		<content>  Llanelli's name is derived from the  
 "Church of Elli"."Llan" is the Welsh  
 for Church or enclosure and Elli was a
 sixth century Saint after whom the    
 Parish Church was named.              
  Llanelli is a very pleasant town,and 
 has a very moderate climate.We seldom 
 have extremes of sun or snow,but we do
 have a generous amount of rain!       
  The Borough Council,in keeping with  
 our motto,are making every effort to  
 improve the town.The old smoky        
 industrial image has disappeared with 
 the demise of all the heavy           
 industries,and the town is now a very 
 good,clean shopping centre.The        
 pedestrianized shopping area is       
 enhanced with trees and fountains,a   
 sunken garden,grassy areas and        
 seats.The car parks are all           
 conveniently situated to make shopping
 a pleasure.                           </content>
