 In the Lower Swansea Valley there have
 been a lot of changes.A{hotel}and lake
 have been built. To achieve this      
 they cleared away all the old slag    
 heaps and the ruins of the old metal  
 works.  They have also cleaned out the
 pond and stocked it with fish.  Down  
 in the valley they have built a{sports
{stadium}with a fine grandstand and    
 indoor training facilities.  It is    
 called the Morfa Stadium after one of 
 the old copper works.  People using   
 the stadium has caused so much extra  
 traffic that a{new bridge}is needed   
 over the River Tawe.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
