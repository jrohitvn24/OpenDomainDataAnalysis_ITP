 The College has a Rugby Team, a       
 Football Team, and Netball and Hockey 
 Teams.  They let boys take Cookery and
 girls take Woodwork.  There is not a  
 Brassband or a Pop Group, but there   
 are various instruments for students  
 to practice on.  The students are     
 allowed to wear anything they like,   
 within reason to College.  An Annexe  
 of the College is at the old Twmpath  
 Secondary School, Twmpath Road,       
 Pontypool.  This is about one mile    
 away from the main College building.
