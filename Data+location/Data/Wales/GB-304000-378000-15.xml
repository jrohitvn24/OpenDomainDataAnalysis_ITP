		<content>  The Bronze and Iron Age Hillfort on  
 Moel Hiraddug dominates the area.     
 Nearby an important battle took place 
 in 1034 between the sons of Edwin and 
 Rhydderch.Later in 1241 Henry 3rd     
 erected a castle soon destroyed by    
 Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1256.  
 In 1263 Einion the second son of      
 Rhodri Flaidd was killed during the   
 seige of the castle.A standing stone  
 commemorating this,was moved to the   
 Parish Church dedicated to the  two   
 Celtic Saints Cwyfan and Bridget.The  
 name Dyserth,probably comes from the  
 Latin word"Deserta" which means a     
 saint's cell in a lonely and deserted 
 place.The Church also contains "The   
 Jesse Window"removed from Basingwerk  
 Abbey.Even the main Holywell to Rhyl  
 Road is known in Dyserth as Ffordd    
 Ffrainc,referring to the Norman       
 Invasion route to Rhuddlan Castle.    </content>
