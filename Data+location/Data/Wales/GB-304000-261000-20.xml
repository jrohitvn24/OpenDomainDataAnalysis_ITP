		<content>   From the 17th century onwards this  
 area is recorded under the name of    
 Cwn_y_Gof or Blacksmith's Dingle who  
 was cured of an eye disease in the    
 well there.                           
  In about 1867 a Saline Spring was    
 discovered there and a pump erected   
 nearby. The land was laid out as      
 gardens and was planted with trees. In
 about 1880 it was named Rock Spa.     
   Three other springs were discovered 
 called Magnesia, Chalybeate and       
 Sulphur.                              
   The eye well is said to cure eye    
 disease whilst the Chalybeate was     
 recommended for anaemia and general   
 debility.                             
   After a decline in the use of Spa   
 Waters there is now a sharp increase  
 in their popularity and sales are     
 increasing.
