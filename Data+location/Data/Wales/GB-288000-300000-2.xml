		<title>02LANGUAGE ENGLISH AND WELSH</title>
		<content> Twenty years ago there were more Welsh
 speaking people than English speaking 
 people in Llanbrynmair.Now more       
 English speaking people have come into
 our area to live.Forty children speak 
 Welsh and thirty-four speak English at
 our school.The English children in our
 school are learning Welsh.Here is a   
 sample of Welsh. "{Bore da}"means"Good
 morning","{Prynhawn da}"means "Good   
 afternoon","{Nos da}"means"Good night"
 and"{Cymru am Byth}"means Wales for   
 ever".For the English speaking people 
 in our area there are learning classes
 for learning Welsh once per week.In my
 home I always speak Welsh with my     
 father and mother,brother and         
 sister.When letters or posters about  
 the school activities are sent to the 
 home they are always in English and   
 Welsh.We are now trying to save the   
 Welsh language from extinction.       </content>
