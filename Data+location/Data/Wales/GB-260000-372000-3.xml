		<content> Much of the land is owned by the      
{Penrhyn estate,}one of the biggest    
 landowners in the area. In the last   
 century and for much of this they also
 owned the big{Penrhyn Quarries}at     
 Bethesda and before{Port Penrhyn}was  
 built, with its tramway connection to 
 the Quarry, the slate was brought to  
 the mouth of the{River Ogwen,}near to 
 the present Spinneys nature reserve,  
 for shipping to its markets. Now few  
 signs, if any, remain of this traffic.
                                       
 At the promontory at reference{605731 
 there is an old bath house at the     
 waters edge. This was also part of the
 facilities ofered at the castle       
 although no longer in use!
