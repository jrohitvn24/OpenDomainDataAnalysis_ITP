		<title>05A Day in my Life by K.SLADE</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7.30 a.m. on Thursday.My 
 mother brought a cup of tea and a     
 fluoride tablet into my bedroom.It    
 was a bright morning,I fed my rabbits 
 before getting ready for school.I     
 played the violin in the school       
 orchestra during assembly which       
 started at 9.00 a.m.During the day I  
 did Maths,English,Science and watched 
 a television programme called "Animals
 in Action".I had a violin lesson with 
 Mrs. James followed by an orchestra   
 practice at 3.30 p.m.I went home at   
 4.30 p.m. and brought the rabbits up  
 to the house for their excercise.I    
 watched "Connections" and "Top of the 
 Pops" on the television before supper.
 I had a cup of tea and watched the    
 news before going to bed.I read       
 "Adrian Mole" until 10.00 p.m. when I 
 finally snuggled down in my duvet and 
 fell asleep.                          </content>
