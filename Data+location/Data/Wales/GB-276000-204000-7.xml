		<content>      The main building structure      
 dates back to the fifteenth century, a
 period when{Gellidochliethe}was one of
 the stately homes of Wales and offered
 shelter to monks during Thomas        
 Cromwell's oppression of the Catholic 
 church.                               
      During the Elizabethan period    
 there were two chapels at Henllan     
 Uchaf and Henllan Isaf. The latter was
 farmed by the Cistercian monks from   
 Neath Abbey.                          
     {Gellidochliethe}is now a 580 acre
 working farm and hosts a successful   
 business trading in{'Welsh Farmhouse  
{Holidays'.}The house was visited by   
 the Select Committee of the           
 'Department of Trade and Industry'    
 during their tour of Wales between    
 February 5th-7th 1985.
