		<title>07NORTH PEMBROKE - HOUSING</title>
		<content>    Pembroke is a very old town which  
 grew in importance in Norman times.   
 Today, it is combined with Pembroke   
 Dock and has a population of 14500.   
    The part  of north Pembroke within 
 our block has very few old houses.    
 There is part of a council estate     
 about 30 years old at The Green.      
 There is a modern private housing     
 estate at Whitehall Drive and an      
 estate at Buttermilk Lane which used  
 to be owned by the Army as officers'  
 quarters but these are now privately  
 owned.                                
    Just south of this is a new council
 estate off Devon Drive which has many 
 terraced houses. There are also some  
 private older houses at Golden Hill.  
    Of 17 local schoolchildren inter-  
 viewed, 9 lived in terraced houses, 3 
 in bungalows and 5 in semis or        
 detatched houses.                     </content>
