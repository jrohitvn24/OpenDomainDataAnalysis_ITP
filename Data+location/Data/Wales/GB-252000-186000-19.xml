		<title>19LIVING IN PENNARD IN 1985.</title>
		<content> OUR AREA IS A VERY POPULAR TOURIST    
 ATTRACTION, BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL    
 BEAUTY. TOURISTS STAY HERE IN THE     
 SUMMER AT GUEST HOUSES OR PREFER TO   
 CAMP OR CARAVAN OUTDOORS. THERE ARE   
 MANY ACTIVITIES FOR THE TOURISTS TO   
 ENJOY. IN SANDY LANE THERE ARE        
 SUMMER CHALETS FOR THE TOURISTS TO    
 RENT OVER THE SUMMER.                 
     LIFE IN PENNARD IS VERY ORDINARY. 
 IT HAS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES.  
 ADVANTAGES IN BEING NEAR THE SEA AND  
 HAVING PLENTY OF PLACES TO PLAY, ALSO 
 THERE ARE MANY PLACES TO SHOP FOR ALL 
 YOUR NEEDS. DISADVANTAGES IN HAVING   
 LOTS OF TOURISTS AROUND AND HAVING    
 SOME TOURISTS RUINING THE BEACH AND   
 ITS SURROUNDINGS BY DROPPING LITTER   
 AND NOT CARING FOR THE LAND. THERE IS 
 PLENTY OF COUNTRYSIDE. THE AIR IS     
 FRESH WITH NO POLLUTION. PENNARD IS A 
 PLEASANT PLACE TO LIVE.               </content>
