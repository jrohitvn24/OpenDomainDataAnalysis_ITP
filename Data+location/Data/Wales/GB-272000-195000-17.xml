		<title>17The Town of Neath.</title>
		<content> Neath is a large town but seems to be 
 in the process of change.At the moment
 it is still more or less industrial in
 character but there does seem to be a 
 movement which suggests that tourism  
 will play a more important part in the
 future of Neath.                      
 As more and more works are closing    
 there seem to be various tourist      
 attractions springing up to replace   
 them.For instance at the moment we    
 have the following which are open to  
 the public:Penscynor Wildlife         
 Park,Afan Argoed Country Park, Margam 
 Abbey Country Park,Neath Abbey        
 Monastery,Cefn Coed Coal Museum and   
 Pelenna Mountain Centre.Also at the   
 moment the Aberdulais Industrial Basin
 and the Vale of Neath Canal are being 
 developed as tourist attractions.
