		<title>10THE CLEDDAU BRIDGE, BURTON</title>
		<content>   The deep estuary of Milford Haven   
 and small inlet of Westfield Pill made
 the journey from {Neyland to Pembroke 
 28 miles; so the County Council gave  
 permission for two bridges to be      
 built. Now the journey is only a few  
 miles. Before the bridges were built, 
 a ferry from{Burton to Pembroke}was   
 run, but that did not provide a 24    
 hour service which the bridges do.    
   The{Cleddau Bridge}was opened on the
{23rd May 1975}by the Secretary of     
 State for Wales John Morris and a     
 party of children from{Burton V.C.    
{School}were invited to the opening    
 ceremony.                             
   Now the County Council are arguing  
 that the Â£1.2 million debt will not be
 paid for at least 40 years and only   
 then if charges are increased         
 regularly.                            
{  The argument still goes on.}        </content>
