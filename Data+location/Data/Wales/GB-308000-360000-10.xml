		<content> The Christian Faith has played an     
 important part in the area since      
 earliest times.The Welsh word "Llan"  
 means"Church"and is a common prefix to
 many places, e.g."Llanynys" in our    
 case.                                 
 Normano-English gentry established    
 most Churches in the area during the  
 13-17th C.The 18th C.saw the rapid    
 adoption of Nonconformity by the      
 common people accentuated by the Tithe
 Wars of the latter 19th c.            
 Rhewl chapel was built in 1844 and    
 rebuilt in 1926.It is unusual in      
 having cinema-style seating.          
 Llanynys Church is restored           
 16C;displaying particularly beautiful 
 stained glass.                        
 Both conduct bilingual services,mainly
 Welsh at the chapel.
