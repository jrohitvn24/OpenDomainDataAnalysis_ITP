		<content>   Stackpole is not well served by     
 public transport.Only one service bus 
 runs to Pembroke each week, on Friday 
 afternoon.In the last six years it has
 been possible to use the school bus on
 Monday,Wednesday and Friday after it  
 has dropped the children at the school
 in Stackpole.It is also possible on   
 these days to catch the school bus    
 from Pembroke to the village in the   
 afternoon.These buses seldom carry    
 more than one or two passengers and   
 are usually empty.                    
   There is a volunteer car care system
 for emergencies such as visits to the 
 doctor or the hospital in Pembroke    
 Dock.This scheme is underused as it   
 only operates infrequently.           
   Single women without cars rely upon 
 friends or relatives to drive them to 
 town.
