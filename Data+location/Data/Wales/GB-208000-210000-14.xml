 Gilroy Phillips in 1960. It began at  
 Withybush Airfield in Haverfordwest.  
 The 25th Anniversary is this year,    
 1985. About 50 to 60 people attend on 
 Saturdays and Sundays.The membership  
 fee is Â£50 a year and members pay Â£2  
 per day when they attend. Flights last
 about 10 minutes. Visitors pay Â£6 per 
 flight. Gliders hold two people. The  
 club owns three gliders, 2 K_10s, and 
 one T_21s. They only fly in good      
 weather conditions. The Club takes    
 part in shows and gives rides. There  
 have been several crashes and one man 
 was killed.                           
  There is also a Model Aircraft Club  
 on Templeton Airfield. Members make   
 and fly their model aeroplanes.
