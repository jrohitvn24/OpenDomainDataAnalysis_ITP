		<content> BLACKALDERN IS A BEAUTIFUL MANSION.   
 IT                                    
 WAS FIRST BUILT IN 1770 BUT THE FRONT 
 PART WAS BUILT 200 YEARS LATER.THE    
 PERSON WHO OWNS IT IS MRS DE QUINCY   
 SHE HAS LIVED THERE FOR 20 YEARS.SHE  
 HAS 175 ACRES OF LAND.THE SIZE OF HER 
 LITTLE GARDEN IS 2 ACRES ALTOGETHER   
 .MOST OF THE FARM LAND IS PASTURE.THE 
 RHODODENDRONS COME FROM JAPAN,KOREA   
 AND CHINA.IT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC ON 
 2 DAYS A YEAR AND THEY OPEN A LITTLE  
 MARKET.IT WOULD BE AN IDEAL PLACE FOR 
 TOURISTS TO GO AND THE SIGHT OF THE   
 GARDENS WOULD ENCHANT VISITORS. THE   
 GARDENS HAVE LOTS OF FLOWERS BUT THEY 
 ARE MOSTLY AZEALEAS AND               
 RHODODENDRONS.I THINK IT IS A MOST    
 BEAUTIFUL PLACE.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
