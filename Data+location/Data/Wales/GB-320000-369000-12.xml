		<title>12Pocket Money</title>
		<content> In my house a regular event each      
 Friday is my dad giving pocket money  
 to my sister and I. Pocket money is   
 our spending money for the week, and I
 have been given pocket money for as   
 long as I can remember. One of the    
 good things about my birthday is that 
 I get a rise in my pocket money. At   
 the moment I am given Â£2.50p per week 
 and my sister who is two years younger
 than I, receives Â£2.00.               
                                       
   74% of people receive pocket money  
   10% of people have part time jobs   
       and receive wages instead of    
       pocket money.                   
   16% don't receive a set amount of   
       pocket money but ask their      
       parents when they want money for
       something.
