		<title>04GOLF COURSE BRYNFORD</title>
		<content>  There is a golf course near the      
 village which is called Holywell      
 Golf club. It is a nine hole golf     
 course.There are flags in the greens  
 to show where the holes are.There     
 are lots of hills by the golf course  
 also gorse bushes and ferns where lots
 of people loose their golf balls.     
  After they have played golf they go  
 to the golf house for some drinks and 
 a meal.Over the meal they talk about  
 the game. In the club house they also 
 play games like snooker and darts.    
  There is a road going between the    
 golf course and club house. Passing   
 cars have to be careful so the  golf  
 balls dont hit the windows of the car.
 The golfers sometimes have trouble    
 with the sheep running up and down    
 the golf course.
