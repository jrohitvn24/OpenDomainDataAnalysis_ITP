		<title>09A CHILD'S DAY IN WELSHPOOL</title>
		<content> I am 12 years old and live in         
 Welshpool. Like most other weekdays I 
 get up at 07.00 and have breakfast    
 with my father and twin sister. I then
 shower and get dressed in my school   
 uniform of a blue skirt and jumper,a  
 white blouse and a green and silver   
 tie. Before I go to school I have to  
 take our two pet dogs for a walk.     
 I arrive in school at about 08.40     
 and at 08.55 go to my classroom for   
 registration. We then have assembly   
 until about 9.15 a.m.                 
 Afterwards we go to lessons (8 of     
 them!) until 15.45 p.m. with an       
 hour's break for lunch.               
 After walking home I start on my      
 homework which takes up most of the   
 evening, but when that's finished I   
 sit down with my family and watch     
 television. I go to bed at about      
 21.30.                                </content>
