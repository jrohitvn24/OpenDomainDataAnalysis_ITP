		<title>01Garway Village</title>
		<content> Garway is a linear village in         
 Herefordshire, on the Welsh border.   
 The SW corner of our block is just in 
 Wales. Garway is brooded over by      
 Garway Hill (1202ft.), the Graig      
 Syfyrddin (1144ft.), and, more        
 distantly, the Black Mountains. The   
 River Monnow forms the national       
 boundary. The whole area is primarily 
 grazing land for cattle and sheep.    
 Garway was once owned by the Knights  
 Templars and Hospitallers, and the    
 original village church was circular. 
 On the adjoining farm there is an     
 ancient dovecot. The Garway Moon Inn  
 is opposite a part of Garway Common   
 which has been cleared for sports and 
 recreational purposes. Garway is      
 served by one bus, which goes to      
 Ross-on-Wye, 10 miles away.
