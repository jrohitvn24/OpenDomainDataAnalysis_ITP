{Every October Swansea is the host for 
{one of the largest music festivals in 
{Britain.} In 1984 the festival        
 celebrated its 50th anniversary.      
 The festival lasts for a month and    
 includes all types of musical events, 
 from symphony concerts to jazz and    
 non-musical items like poetry readings
 and art exhibitions.                  
 The main venue is the{Brangwyn Hall   
 with its famous murals but every year 
 the festival seems to get bigger and  
 bigger with more and more locations.  
 In recent years the festival period   
 has also included a{Fringe  Festival  
 similar to that in Edinburgh.
