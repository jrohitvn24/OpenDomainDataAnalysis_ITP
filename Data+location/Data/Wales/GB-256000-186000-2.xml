		<content>   I live in a small village outside   
{Bishopston}called{Pennard,}a very     
 small community with many clubs which 
 take place in the Community Hall. I   
 belong to an Indoor bowls Club but    
 there are others e.g. Archery, Mother 
 and Toddler group and Badminton.      
 Everyday I get out my bike and cycle  
 up the road to walk 2 dogs. Besides   
 the clubs there is a shop nearby, a   
 Library, a Doctors Surgery, a Primary 
 school,the nearest city is{Swansea.   
 Here you can get anything you want    
 without getting wet as the Quadrant is
 all under cover.                      
   I live in a semi-detatched house    
 with a very large garden. My grandma  
 lives with us and I have a pet cat and
 3 goldfish in our garden pond. Every  
 Saturday we go for a walk down to the 
 nearby beach.
