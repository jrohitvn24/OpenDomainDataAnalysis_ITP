		<title>18WELSH LANGUAGE.</title>
		<content> Concern is being continuously         
 expressed about the number of people  
 who can speak the{Welsh Language      
 fluently.This concern is justified by 
 recent research, which has revealed a 
 dramatic decrease in the number of    
 Welsh speaking school children.It is  
 estimated that little over a quarter  
 of the children in the area, however, 
 are native speakers of Welsh and of   
 all the children who come to school   
 without any knowledge of Welsh less   
 than 10 percent come to speak it      
 fluently.Denbigh is, therefore, one of
 the  critical areas of the Wales of   
 the 80's as far as the language is    
 concerned.Educationalists believe     
 there is a need to safeguard the      
 language of Welsh speakers and to     
 persuade the non-Welsh speakers that  
 easy communication and Welsh heritage 
 are desirable objectives.             </content>
