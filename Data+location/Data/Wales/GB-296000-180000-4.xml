		<content> Employment in the village has changed 
 over the since the Second World War.  
 In 1945 the main employment was       
 working in the{foundry}and{coal       
{mining.}In 1955 it was working in the{
{colliery}and{farming.}In 1965 it was  
{coal mining}and{agriculture.}And in   
 1975 the main employment was again    
 working in the{foundry. }             
    We carried out a survey in our     
 class to see which were the most      
 common jobs for parents. We found out 
 that factory work was most common for 
 men and women. The second most common 
 work for men was motor mechanic, while
 for women it was teaching. The        
 unemployment rate among men was about 
 15%.
