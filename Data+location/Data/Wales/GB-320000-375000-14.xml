		<content> Worral's directory of 1874 described  
 Bagillt as a "large thriving village  
 in the township of Bagillt Fawr and   
 Bagillt Fechan in the parish and union
 of Holywell and situated about 2 and a
 half miles from the town of Holywell  
 and the same distance from Flint...." 
 By the late 19 century the population 
 was nearly 3000.                      
 The name of Bagillt has changed over  
 the years.In 1086 it was Bachelie.It  
 became Bacheleia in the 13 century,   
 Bagythel in 1300,Backelegh in 1325,   
 Bakkeleigh in 1360,Bakeley in 1536,   
 Bagild in 1539 and Bagylht in 1695.   
 We are not sure how Bagillt got its   
 name.Research suggests it could have  
 been named after a rich man who owned 
 the land.Another explanation is that  
 it means "a clearing in a forest where
 the wild boar is found".Nobody knows  
 for sure .                            </content>
