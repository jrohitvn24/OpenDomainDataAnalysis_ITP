		<content>  The estate where I live did not exist
 fifteen years ago, it was all         
 farmland.                             
                                       
 When my parents moved in in 1971 there
 was only a small part of my road      
 built, the rest of the estate was     
 builders and fields. My parents paid  
 less than Â£10,000 for our house, today
 it is worth more than three times that
 amount.                               
                                       
 My grandparents did not own their own 
 houses, they rented. My mum says that 
 when she was young few of her friends 
 lived in houses their parents owned.  
 Almost all of my friends do.          
                                       
 Our estate has only one shop and a    
 small infants' school, otherwise there
 is nothing but houses.
