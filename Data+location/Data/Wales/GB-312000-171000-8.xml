		<title>08Riding Stables-Or Not?</title>
		<content> To the north-east of Dinas Powys is a 
 farm called "Mill Farm", but on our   
 ordnance survey maps it is shown as   
 riding stables.                       
 In previous years the local council   
 was opposed to using the land for     
 farming. The first owner allowed      
 disabled people to meet here for      
 activities such as riding, hence the  
 misleading name "Riding Stables".     
 At present Mr Idwal Symonds, the      
 farmer, is the third owner. He breeds 
 Shire horses which he frequently shows
 at agricultural events around the     
 country. Along with this interest he  
 breeds Welsh Black cattle and Cheviot 
 sheep.                                
 Today the stables are located near    
 St.Andrews Major, approximately three 
 miles south-west of Mill Farm.
