		<title>11Housing in Gwyddelwern</title>
		<content> The Gwyddelwern area is fortunate as  
 it does not have major housing        
 problems.                             
 There are many different types of     
 dwellings, large{farm houses,}some    
 over 150 years old built mostly of    
 Welsh stone, with slated roofs. The   
 majority have been modernised and     
 repaired with the help of Local       
 Authority Grants. Smaller houses have 
 also benefited from bathrooms         
 installed.                            
 New{modern houses}and{bungalows}are on
 the increase, and some are still under
 construction.                         
 There are a large proportion of       
{Council owned houses}&amp; flats, 2 &amp; 3   
 bedroom, the rents of these are around
 Â£20 - Â£25 per week. The tenants do not
 change often and many have bought     
 them.            Mrs E. Westcott.
