		<title>09Minera Quarry</title>
		<content>  The Tarmac Roadstone Quarry can be   
 found cutting into the side of Minera 
 Mountain.In the quarry they produce   
 limestone which is used mainly for    
 building roads,paths and car parks.   
 Twenty four men work there,sixteen on 
 production, and there are big noisy   
 machines and trucks.Although it's a   
 noisy place,birds nest in the rocks   
 and a fox is rearing her cubs near to 
 all the activity.                     
  It is hard work and the quarry is    
 open to driving rain,wind and snow    
 which sweep across the mountain.In the
 summer when it is light the men work  
 from 6am to 5pm but in the winter they
 might work from 7am to 4pm.About one  
 hundred and fifty lorry loads of dry  
 and coated aggregate leave the quarry 
 every day.At the present rate of      
 demand there's enough rock to last    
 from five to seven years.             </content>
