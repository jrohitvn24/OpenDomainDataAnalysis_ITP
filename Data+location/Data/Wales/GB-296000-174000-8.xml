		<content>  Cowbridge has no really significant  
 employment base. The most important   
 sources of local jobs are education,  
 shops and services. More than half the
 work force travel outside the area to 
 work. It looks that as yet            
 unemployment is not a significant     
 problem. Nationally most job losses   
 have been in medium and heavy industry
 categories which do not contribute    
 much employment to the Cowbridge area.
 Some forecasts show that large        
 reductions in office and service      
 employment are possible, either of the
 result of the economic deppression or 
 as a consequence of advances in micro 
 electronics technology. This kind of  
 unemployment could have a greater     
 importance on the Cowbridge area. Out 
 of 63 people interviewed only 9 worked
 in Cowbridge the majority of the      
 remainder worked in Cardiff. {        </content>
