		<content>     Part of our Survey sought to find 
 out the extent of ownership of luxury

 following statistics show:            
                                       
    All homes possessed a television   
 set of which, 75% were colour and 17% 
 had teletext. In addition many homes  
 also possessed additional colour and  
 black and white sets.                 
    6% owned a home computer.          
    34% owned a Sterio hi-fi.          
    18% owned a microwave oven.
