		<title>14LANGUAGE   BEULAH - GARTH</title>
		<content> Serious decline in Welsh speaking,    
 which had begun before the advent of  
 many new English residents. Welsh is  
 taught in schools - a peripatetic     
 teacher serving primary schools in the
 Builth district, including Irfon      
 Valley School. Hardly any fluent Welsh
 speakers, even amongst middle-aged    
 people - probably no more than a dozen
 older folk. Welsh influence still     
 stronger in Beulah than Garth, it     
 decreases as one gets nearer Builth.  
 Almost all houses in Beulah have Welsh
 names, fewer in Garth.                
 Powys County Council road signs are in
 English only.                         
 No families of foreign extraction,    
 speaking other languages in the home.
