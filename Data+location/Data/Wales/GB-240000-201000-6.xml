		<content>  Court Farm (CWRT in Welsh) is an     
 historic{manor house,}which stands on 
 a hill about half a mile North-West of
 St. Illtyd's Church. It is the only   
{Elizabethan House}remaining in        
 Carmarthenshire and was used on{a 1757
{chart to guide vessels along  the     
{Burry estuary. They took the tall     
{chimneys of the house and the church  
{tower as markers. Court Leets were    
{also held there.                      
  The house dates from the late        
 fifteenth or early sixteenth century. 
 In 1948 it was abandoned. Now it is a 
 ruin-the grey stone building with its 
 'battlemented' wall looks down on the 
 village.                              
  A group of local historians are      
 trying to raise funds to restore the  
 Court to its former glory.
