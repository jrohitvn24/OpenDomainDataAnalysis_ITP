		<title>20HAWARDEN CASTLE</title>
		<content> The Parliamentary leader  Sir William 
 Brereton reported the event in the    
 house of Commons. This was not the    
 castle's only involvement in the Civil
 war.The Royalists at once tried to    
 take the castle back they found the   
 garrison badly prepared and took the  
 commander prisoner in the village of  
 Hawarden, however the garrison that   
 was left in the castle refused to     
 surrender.The Royalists laid seige and
 the castle eveentually fell after     
 twelve days.A year passed before the  
 Parliamentary forces mounted an attack
 on Chester and Hawarden. The seige    
 lasted for a year before the castle   
 surrendered. In 1647 the castle was   
 destroyed by the Parliamentary forces.
