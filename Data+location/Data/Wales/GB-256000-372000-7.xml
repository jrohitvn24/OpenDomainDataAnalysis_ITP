		<title>07Thomas's family life</title>
		<content> My family, mum, dad, sister, brother  
 and I, have two dogs and a cat. My    
 dad works at Robertson's Research     
 near Llandudno some twenty miles      
 away. My mum is a teacher at a private
 school near here. My sister and I go  
 to Cae Top Primary School and my      
 brother to Friars Comprehensive       
 school, which dates from 1557.        
         On most weekends my dad either
 plays golf or we all go fishing.      
         Before we came to Bangor we   
 lived in London and my dad worked for 
 Letraset.We used to go to a school    
 called Strand-on-the-Green. We moved  
 because my mum was born in Wales. We  
 wanted to live in a more rural area   
 and most of our relations live in     
 Wales.
