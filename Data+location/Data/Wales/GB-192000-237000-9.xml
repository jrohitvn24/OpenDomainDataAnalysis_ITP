 The County Echo is Fishguard and      
 Goodwick's local newspaper.  It also  
 covers the outlying districts of the  
 area.  So the paper is also known as  
 the St Davids City Chronicle.  The    
 main office is in Fishguard but it has
 another office in St Davids.          
  Eight people work on the paper.      
 Papers are sold through about 56      
 different shops in the areas covered  
 by the paper.  The paper is printed on
 Monday and comes out on a Tuesday.    
  Each day stories are reported.       
 Advertisements are also included.     
  The first headline the paper ever    
 carried was the arrival at Fishguard  
 Harbour of the ocean liner Mauritania.
