		<content>   In order to protect the buildings   
 and form of our national heritage the 
 ancient core of Clyro was designated a
{"Conservation Area"}in 1983. It was   
 important to preserve a typical       
 example of a{Welsh Border Village}of  
 the Wye Valley and its progression    
 from ancient times to the present day.
  Some of the open spaces are included 
 e.g.{"The Orchard,"}cider apple and   
 pear trees of venerable size and age. 
   Earliest buildings are a{Mediaeval  
{Gateway}at Clyro Court Farm and {     
{"Sacred Cottage"}(priest's house).    
 Fine groups of Welsh stone cottages   
 (16th - 18th century), village shop,  
 cottage once Police Station and Post  
 Office, Baskerville Arms,             
 Mid-Victorian cottages and Kilvert's  
 lodgings, surround church and         
 graveyard.{Clyro Court, Caemawr and   
{Old Vicarage}are of the 19th century. </content>
