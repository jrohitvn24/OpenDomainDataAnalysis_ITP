		<title>18BETWS DRIFT MINE AMMANFORD</title>
		<content>  This mine is located 2 miles from    
 Ammanford, on the border of the South 
 Wales Coalfield. Betws Drift Mine was 
 opened in May, 1978, the first mine   
 to be opened in over a decade on the  
 coalfield.                            
  It replaced a number of neighbouring 
 collieries where all the coal was     
 exhausted. The mine taps the last     
 significant reserves of the red vein  
 anthracite coal. The seam is 4'6" to  
 5' deep at Betws, and there is said   
 to be a 5 million ton reserve.        
  Almost 700 miners are employed; the  
 majority were from the closed Betws   
 and Graig Merthyr mines. The men were 
 trained before hand to handle the     
 modern computers, in-seam ploughs and 
 disc cutters used in the mine.        
  The output/manshift is 15.6 tonnes,  
 on the face and 1983 saleable output  
 was 589 thousand tonnes.              </content>
