		<title>17 Fishing on the River Wye.</title>
		<content>  The River Wye is one of the most     
popular salmon fisheries and has a     
high degree of freshwater fishing.The  
Wye is stocked full of many freshwater 
fish,such as trout,chub,pike and many  
other species .From the Mallybrook to  
the Rowing Club,there is a lot of      
competition for salmon,this stretch is 
now owned by West Glamorgan Anglers.   
  Most of the salmon caught are sold to
resteraunts and can bring an average   
price of 50 pounds.Salmon is a very    
expensive fish to buy,at about 4.50 per
pound.                                 
  Poaching is a very serious problem,  
many thousands of salmon are stolen,   
which is very costly for stockists.    
  A new law has been introduced in 1985
in connection with the prosecution of  
poachers.By the new law the accused has
the onus of proving himself innocent.  
Fines are often severe.                </content>
