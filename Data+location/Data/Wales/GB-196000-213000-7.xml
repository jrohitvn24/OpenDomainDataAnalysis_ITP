		<content> The area is covered by a Community    
 Council which meets in Uzmaston Church
 Hall monthly to discuss all aspects of
 planning and other matters of local   
 concern.    There are 14 members and  
 representatives from the County and   
 Preseli Councils are invited.         
 Attendances are always good.          
 The Community Council owns Uzmaston   
 Village Green.     Matters discussed  
 recently have been:- plans for new    
 roads and homes, parking in dangerous 
 places, road safety for children on   
 bicycles, street cleaning, large      
 overhanging trees on the New Road,    
 buses, closure of Rhos School. Also   
 the existence and condition of        
 footpaths particularly Fortunes       
 Frolic, a riverside walk, where plans 
 to provide wooden circuit apparatus   
 costing Â£1500, for recreation purposes
 are under consideration.              </content>
