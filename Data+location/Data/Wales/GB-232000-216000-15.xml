		<content> Shopping can be a problem in a rural  
 area such as ours.Within our block    
 there are two Post Offices which sell 
 a few groceries and also a small      
 general store but no supermarket.     
 The nearest small market town is 2    
 miles away ,eventhough there are a few
 food shops,butchers and a bakery      
 there,the nearest draper is 6 miles   
 away.                                 
 To add to this a large number of      
 people are not on a bus route.This can
 be a problem for the elderly and for  
 mothers with young children.          
 During the last few years an          
 incresing number of people are taking 
 advantage of late night shopping in   
 the local towns.Mail Order is becoming
 more popular for household and general
 goods.                                
 Some tradesmen sell goods door to door
 in the area.                          </content>
