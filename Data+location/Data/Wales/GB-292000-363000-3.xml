		<content>     The Llansannan Education          
 Centre,Canolfan Addysg Bro Aled,was   
 opened in April 1967 to replace the   
 old Llansannan controlled school.It   
 was the first of its kind in the      
 western part of Clwyd then known as   
 Denbighshire.Since then it has been a 
 hub of activity every night except    
 Sunday.                               
      The centre is financially        
 supported by the Clwyd County Council 
 receiving aa annual rent from the     
 organizing committee.This comprises of
 two representatives from each of the  
 fifteen member societies,and each     
 organisation has free use of the      
 centre for an annual minimum          
 contribution of Â£15.00.The centre is  
 appreciated to such an extent that the
 societies sometimes donate up to      
 Â£100;this being the proceeds of a     
 single event such as a local concert. </content>
