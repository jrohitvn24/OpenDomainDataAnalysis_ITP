 semi-detached with their own          
 garage.There is a new housing estate  
 being built at the site of the Old    
 Allotment Gardens (167753) and will   
 consist of flats, bungalows and       
 semi-detached houses.                 
{Residential / Commercial (170750)     
  The houses off Cornwall Street are   
 semi-detached with their own garage,  
 but the bulk of the houses in this    
 grid are terraced without a garage.   
 These houses are over 60 years old,   
 and many people are receiving         
 government grants to renovate them.   
 To the north of Cornwall Street there 
 is a high rise block of flats - The   
 Elizabethan Flats.  (contd 16)        </content>
