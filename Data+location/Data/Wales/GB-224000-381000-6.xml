 The major employer of labour in       
 Holyhead is SEALINK and the ship      
 repair yard.Many are employed as      
 seamen and crew on the car ferries and
 container vessels.However the ship    
 repair industry has been run down due 
 to the lack of an adequate dry dock to
 hold the larger vessels of today.     
    The unemployment rate in the area  
 is 21%.This rate could be higher if   
 the proposed layoff of workers at the 
 Anglesey Aluminium becomes fact.      
   School leavers find it very         
 difficult tofind full time            
 employment.A few ,especially          
 girls,find work in the service        
 industry.The boys that do not have    
 examination passes are placed on      
 Government training schemes.
