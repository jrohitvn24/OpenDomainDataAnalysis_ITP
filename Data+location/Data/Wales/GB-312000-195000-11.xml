		<title>11Population-Cefn Hengoed</title>
		<content> The village of Cefn Hengoed is fairly 
 typical of the residential areas of   
 the Rhymney Valley and the rectangle  
 being studied.It comprises            
{a)5 rows of older houses built after  
{the first world war for miners. }     
{b)A 1950's council estate (some of    
{which are now privately owned).       
{c)A 10 year old development of private
{housing.                              
{                                      
{   }Of the families living in the     
 original 5 houses, some 15% of their  
 descendants still live there, but     
 almost as many moved to the council   
 estate when it was built. A small     
 number moved to the private estate    
 when that was built.
