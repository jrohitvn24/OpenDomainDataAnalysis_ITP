		<title>19OLD GATE POST IN GWERSYLLT</title>
		<content>       In the north east corner of our 
 school field is a black metal post    
 about three metres high with a cone   
 shaped top.                           
       Mr. Samuel Roger Shone aged     
 78,who lived in Gwersyllt as a child, 
 remembers the railway line which ran  
 from the Gwersyllt Colliery taking    
 coal to the main railway line to      
 Wrexham.The post is one of the posts  
 of a gate which acted as a level      
 crossing across the railway line.One  
 of the hinge pins can still be seen.  
 The post is made of two pieces of     
 railway line placed side by side.The  
 cone top kept out the rain.Mr.Shone   
 remembers that the gates opened twice 
 a day. There was a wooden footbridge  
 across the line carrying the footpath 
 from Summerhill to Holy Trinity       
 School.The boys from the school often 
 played on the bridge.                 </content>
