 The area is famous for its{scenery}and
 attracts many tourists intent on      
 seeing the{Wye Valley.}Apart from the 
 River Wye,there are two other rivers, 
 the{Monnow}and{Trothy.                
{ Farming}plays an important part in   
 the economy of the area,and the town  
 of Monmouth is essentially a market   
 town.                                 
  Industry is on a small scale,with    
 only relatively few industries on the 
 industrial estate.                    
  There are two villages,{Mitchel Troy 
 which is growing steadily,and the much
 smaller village of{Wonastow.          
{ Charles Rolls,}of{Rolls- Royce}fame, 
 the{Nelson Museum,}and{Monmouth School
 are  associated with the town.        
  It is twinned with the French town   
 Carbonne. Passing through is the      
 busy Midlands -South Wales trunk road.</content>
