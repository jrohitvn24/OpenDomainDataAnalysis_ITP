 Bosherston and Stackpole Cricket Club 
 was formed in 1932 and currently      
 fields two teams on Saturdays and one 
 on Sundays.The youth team plays on    
 Monday nights.The club has enjoyed    
 a most successful season with the     
 first team winning the third division 
 of the Pembrokeshire League thereby   
 winning promotion. The second team    
 plays in the fourth division.         
         The team play two miles       
 outside Stackpole .The field is       
 beautifully situated but it lacks many
 basic facilities.                     
          Most of the players come from
 the Castlemartin peninsula and many   
 are farmers.This means that in busy   
 farming periods,for example when it's 
 silage time,the teams are considerably
 weakened.The players meet at the St.  
 Govan's Inn,Bosherston.               </content>
