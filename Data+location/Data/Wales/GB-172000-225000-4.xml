		<title>04A day in my life. (1)</title>
		<content> My name is Sarah. Today was           
 Friday.I got up about 7 o'clock and   
 wore my normal clothes- a dress and   
 cardigan.After I had got dressed I    
 took my five teddy bears off my bed   
 and made it.I then packed my bag and  
 went downstairs. For breakfast that   
 day I had cheese on toast and orange  
 juice to drink. Then I put on my coat 
 and started to walk to school.Once    
 I was at school I took my coat off and
 put my things on my desk next to Sian 
 Evans(she is my best friend)Just then 
 the bell went and we lined up for     
 assembly.After assembly we went down  
 to class and got out our reading and  
 read while we waited for Sir to come. 
  Then we would do English for first   
 lesson and then the bell would go at  
 quarter to eleven then we would go out
 to play for  about quarter of an hour.
