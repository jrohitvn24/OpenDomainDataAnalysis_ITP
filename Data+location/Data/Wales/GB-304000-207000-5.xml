		<content>  Cont.from (p.1.)Q1.                  
 This was followed by 40% who travelled
 5 to 10 miles away travelling from the
 bottom end of the Merthyr valley and  
 across from the Cynon and Rhymney     
 valleys.The few left were passing     
 trade.                                
 Q2.How often did they shop there?     
 Most (71%) shopped there once a week, 
 19% once a fortnight,and the 10% left 
 less than once a month.               
 Q3.Reasons chosen for shopping there. 
 69% chose late opening,17% chose all  
 round shopping while the rest chose   
 free bus service or cheaper prices.   
 From our results it would seem that a 
 typical Asda shopper shops there for  
 its convenient opening hours and wide 
 range of goods.He or she shops there  
 every week often on the same day.It   
 would seem that out of town shopping  
 is here to stay.                      </content>
