		<content>  Cowbridge is situated within a       
 conservation area with over fifty     
 buildings in the town listed as being 
 of architectural or historical        
 interest. Their present day character 
 largely derives from 18th century     
 prosperity and the subsequent slow    
 pace of change after 1850 when the    
 town was by-passed by the Cardiff to  
 Swansea railway. The "spirit of       
 conservation" was behind the          
 renovation of Old Hall from a derelict
 state a few years ago to provide an   
 excellent new library, clinic and     
 centre for adult education. The key   
 areas for conservation includes the   
 walled town, Eastgate and parts of    
 Westgate, the old village of          
 Llanblethian and the castle. The      
 pattern of narrow walled lanes in the 
 Llanblethian area will be maintained.
