 I get up at 7.30 and have a wash and  
 get dressed.  I usually have toast and
 a cup of tea then I watch TVAM.  My   
 best friend comes for me at 8.20 and  
 we walk to school.{(Education)} We get
 there about 8.40.  The bell goes at   
 8.50.  When the bell goes I say       
 goodbye to Susan and go inside.  Our  
 first lesson is French and our second 
 lesson is Welsh.  Then we have break  
 and I usually get a packet of crisps. 
 Then I go to P.E., we usually do the  
 long jump.  After we go to maths and  
 then it is dinner time.  After dinner 
 it is history then design.  We have   
 different design subjects such as     
 woodwork, pottery, art, needlework and
 cookery.  I am doing needlework at the
 moment.  After needlework it is       
 hometime.                             </content>
