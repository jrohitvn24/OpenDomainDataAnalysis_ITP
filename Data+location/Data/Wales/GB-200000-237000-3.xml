		<title>03Beaches near Dinas, Dyfed</title>
		<content>     There are several beaches near    
{Dinas,}the most popular being         
{PWLLGWAELOD }and {CWM-YR-EGLWYS }.    
 In English {CWM-YR-EGLWYS }means      
 'Valley of the church'.               
     It is known by that name because  
 there is a church which was destroyed 
 in 1850 by a very fierce storm and    
 there is only the West wall left      
 standing now .                        
     {PWLLGWAELOD} has a very          
 interesting history as well.About 250 
 years ago there was a little inn which
 was popular with smugglers but it     
 doesn't happen now(?).                
     Another beach nearby,{ABERBACH  } 
 is very pebbly.There is a  little     
 hill on the beach from  which you can 
 see a very beautiful view - other     
 little hills and the sun setting on   
 the sea.
