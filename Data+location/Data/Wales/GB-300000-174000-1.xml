     The area is part of the Vale of   
 Glamorgan. The Vale is a rich, rolling
 agricultural area used for both       
 pastoral &amp; arable farming. It is well 
 known in South Wales for its          
 attractive countryside, &amp; attracts    
 many visitors to its pubs &amp;           
 restaurants. The most important town  
 in the Vale is Cowbridge, an ancient  
 borough which is believed to have     
 Roman origins.                        
     There is no industry in the block 
 studied by Cowbridge school.The       
 settlements are for the main part     
 dormitory villages which have late    
 Medieval origins.Most are attractive  
 and well kept, though often difficult 
 to get to because the roads are narrow
 and winding.{
