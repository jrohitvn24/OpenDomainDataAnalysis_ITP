		<content> The whole area is mainly industrial.  
 There are a few farms around the edges
 of the area but these are usually     
 small hill farms concentrating on     
 sheep and cattle.                     
 At one time the area was famous for   
 Copper smelting and coal mining but   
 these industries eventually died out. 
 More recently the main employers in   
 the district were Margam Steelworks,  
 Briton Ferry Steelworks, B.P.Oil      
 Refinery,B.P.Chemicals, Metal Box and 
 a few Aluminium works.However,many of 
 these works have been closed or made  
 much smaller and as a result many     
 people have becomed unemployed.       
 The local council have been very      
 worried about this and have tried to  
 attract other smaller industries to   
 the area.These new factories are      
 sometimes grouped together in small   
 industrial estates.                   </content>
