		<content>  The eastern and lower part of the    
 area is made up of fields through     
 which are several tracks and narrow   
 lanes which are bordered by old hedges
 of mixed shrubs and mature trees.     
 Varieties include ash, hazel, holly,  
 wild cherry, hawthorn, willow, oak,   
 sloe, beech and more recently         
 sycamore.                             
  There are three main areas of mixed  
 woodland - Tir-y-coed near Woodlands  
 Cottage, woods near Glyn Terrig in the
 south east of the region and Coed     
 Gwern Rhiw.                           
  There are fir plantations, privately 
 owned to the north of Tir-y-coed, and 
 Forestry Commission on a large area of
 Nercwys Mountain. The forest, of      
 mainly spruce and larch, is in great  
 need of thinning.                     
  On higher ground there are few trees,
 mainly mountain ash and silver birch. </content>
