		<title>16TYPICAL SHEEP SHEARING DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 On our farm there are four men        
 shearing the sheep and there are      
 another two wrapping the sheep's      
 fleece and one catching the sheep to  
 be sheared.We start shearing in the   
 middle of June.We gather our sheep the
 day before we do the shearing.After we
 have gathered the sheep we put them in
 a shed ready to start shearing them   
 the next day.The next day we get up   
 early and go to look at the sheep.We  
 shear about five hundred a day but    
 when we only shear about two to three 
 hundred a day we only have two        
 shearers.When the shearers are ready  
 we get a sheep for them and they start
 to shear them.When they have sheared  
 the sheep one person wraps the wool   
 and one puts pitch on the sheep's back
 to mark them with the farmer's mark.  </content>
