		<content>{RUGBY FOOTBALL}is the unchallenged    
 winter game for men and boys; Tonmawr 
 has a rugby club with a somewhat mixed
 reputation - a recent cup final       
 involving the club had to be abandoned
 because of fighting - although all the
 locals are very clear that Tonmawr's  
 team was utterly blameless. A tour to 
 Scotland is a bi-annual event; every  
 other year, a scottish club comes to  
 Tonmawr. Matches against the          
 neighbouring club - PONTRHYDYFEN - are
 notoriously violent clashes.          
 There is a specially organised section
 for boys (9 - 15 years old, split into
 teams by age) which is given a great  
 deal of active support and training   
 from the adult players.
