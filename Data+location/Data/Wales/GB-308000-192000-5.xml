		<title>05Shopping in Abercynon</title>
		<content> Our group is looking at{trade}in our  
 Domesday block.We have interviewed{   
{shoppers}and{shopkeepers}in Abercynon 
 shopping centre.By doing that we have 
 found out that most people shop in    
 Abercynon but don't do a lot of       
 shopping there because the biggest    
 shop,the Co-op,with the most variety  
 closed down a year ago.Because it has 
 closed shopkeepers think most people  
 catch the free buses to supermarkets  
 like Adco,Carrefour and Tesco.We found
 out that most people do not use free  
 buses and that the best shopping day  
 is Friday.We asked the shopkeepers    
 twelve questions and most of the      
 answers were the same.They want a     
 better car-park and the council to    
 improve the shopping centre but not   
 many people think that the{Abercynon  
{by-pass}will affect their trade.It    
 will open in 1986.                    </content>
