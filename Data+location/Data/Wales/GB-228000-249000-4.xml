		<content>{Cereal farming }is not a very         
 important source of income in the     
 area. Some{barley and corn}is grown.  
 mainly in the south in the valley     
 bottom.{Rape}is becoming more popular,
 and{potatoes}are grown for home       
 consumption, farm-gate sales, and     
 animal feed.{Swede and turnip}are also
 grown. Due to mild wet climate{Silage}
 is made for over-wintering stock, and 
{Hay}produced in good summers.  Farms  
 vary in size from small-holdings of   
 12-20 acres, to mid-sized ones of 70  
 acres and a few larger cereal growing 
 units in the south part. {Poultry}are 
 kept for eggs for the farm, with a few
{battery farms.}Pigs and goats are not 
 often kept. Many farms have been sold,
 the land being bought by nearby       
 farmers, and the farmhouses sold as   
 residential or holiday accomodation.
