		<content> The real difference is more subtle and
 difficult to describe.We arrived,on a 
 freezing day in March,to find the     
 previous owner had lit the fire and   
 left us a bag  of logs.The old lady   
 over the road bustled round with      
 tea,cakes and useful information.We   
 were new to livestock but neighbours  
 were always ready to help and         
 advise,and never treated us as the    
 idiots they probably thought we       
 were.The farms here are still         
 small,the occupants largely           
 inter-related.There is continuity.The 
 driver of the once weekly bus does not
 issue tickets - there is no need,he   
 knows his passengers.It is a          
 community,not just a collection of    
 strangers passing through;{that}is the
 difference.We hope our roots are      
 beginning to grow.
