 We completed a survey of the many     
 games that children in our area enjoy 
 the most.The three favourite games{at 
{home}are computers,Boardgames like    
 Monopoly and card games.With computers
 you can make up programmes,work out   
 business and maths problems and buy   
 games tapes.Our favourite {outdoor    
 games are  Bikes,Football and Roller  
 Skating.The Bike is best because it is
 useful for getting about.You can also 
 race Bikes and do tricks on them.Our  
 favourite games{at School}are football
 (boys) netball(girls) and running.{   
 Football is favourite in our school   
 because we have a football pitch and  
 we play well in the competitions.Two  
 teams play against each other and try 
 to kick or head the ball past the     
 goalkeeper into the opponent's goal.
