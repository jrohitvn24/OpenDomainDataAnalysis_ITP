		<title>15A day in my life.</title>
		<content> I usually get up at 8.20am. I go      
 downstairs and have my breakfast which
 is usually tea and biscuits.When I've 
 finished I go to the bathroom and wash
 and clean my teeth. I then dress and  
 have my hair done.I leave for school  
 at 8.58am as I live very near the     
 school,which starts at 9am. We have   
 registration followed by assembly.    
 After assembly we have a Maths lesson 
 followed by playtime.Then we have     
 English.Dinnertime is at 12 noon and I
 go home for dinner.After dinner I     
 return to school for the afternoon. We
 have different lessons such as Art,   
 Welsh,Science,etc. We have a playtime 
 and school ends at 3.50pm. After tea I
 watch television,read,practise playing
 my violin and sometimes I go out to   
 play. At 9.30pm I have supper and go  
 to bed.
