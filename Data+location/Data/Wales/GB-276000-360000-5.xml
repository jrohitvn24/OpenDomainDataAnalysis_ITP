		<title>05Use of the Welsh Language</title>
		<content> The Welsh language is in daily use by 
 a very large number of the            
 population.Many older people use      
 English only when they must,and great 
 efforts are made to re-inforce the use
 of Welsh from an early age in         
 schools.This means that many of the   
 children are bi-lingual. Gwynedd      
 County Council subsidises adult       
 classes in Welsh. Many church and     
 chapel services are in Welsh. Llanrwst
 holds an annual Eisteddfod.           
 All official notices,place names on   
 sign posts and accounts from public   
 sources such as rates, water          
 rates,gas,electricity,telephones      
 etc.,are submitted in Welsh and       
 English.                              
 Television's Channel Four in this     
 district is the largely Welsh version 
 S4C, and the English version is not   
 broadcast locally.                    </content>
