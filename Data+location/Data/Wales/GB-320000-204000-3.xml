		<content> The largest employer in our block is  
 Roseheyworth Colliery.This pit is     
 linked underground with Cwmtillery Pit
 and employs about 500 men.            
 There were five collieries in the     
 block but this is the only surviver.  
                                       
 To aid the unemployment caused by pit 
 closures several new factories have   
 been opened on reclaimed land in      
 Cwmtillery.These factories make       
 furniture,process frozen food and     
 manufacture tiles.                    
                                       
 Beside these there is only one large  
 employer and this is a clothing       
 factory,which is situated in the old  
 Blaina Secondary School,and employs   
 mostly female labour.                 
                                       
 Besides these employment is in the    
 service industries.                   </content>
