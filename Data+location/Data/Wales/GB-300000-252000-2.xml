		<title>02THE RIVER WYE</title>
		<content> The Wye is noted as the best salmon   
 fishing river in England and Wales.   
 Each year the fish return to the river
 from the sea to spawn in late October 
 to early November. After about 3      
 months the eggs hatch and the young   
 fish grow for 2 or 3 years before they
 themselves return to the sea for a    
 year or 2 to grow prior to returning  
 to spawn in the same river in which   
 they were hatched. Other fish of note 
 here are eels which are caught in     
 large numbers lower down the river and
 the young elvers are netted out as    
 food in the lower half of the river.  
 The Allis shad also enters the river  
 to breed. It is rather a scarce fish  
 in Britain but comes regularly to the 
 Wye reaching as far as Penddol Rocks  
 each May. One other migratory fish to 
 be seen in July in most years is the  
 eel-like sea lamprey.                 </content>
