		<content> The estimated population of the area  
 is approx. 400 and the average age of 
 the population is 45-50, although     
 there are far more elderly people than
 young ones.   Welsh is the predominant
 language but nearly everyone can read,
 speak and write English.  The area    
 experiences a moderate climate.  The  
 prevailing wind is a south westerly.  
 In winter time rainfall is above      
 average and there is a tendency for   
 the last few winters to have above    
 average snow and frost as well.       
 There are several public footpaths and
 these are well sign posted.  The lanes
 as well as the main road are looked   
 after by Clwyd County Council roadmen.
 There is a conservation policy to     
 protect the flora and fauna in the    
 countryside so the grass verges and   
 banks are not cut back.  All hedges   
 are trimmed by land owners.           </content>
