 Our house is a council house. It has  
 12 windows, 2 doors (front and back)  
 I have 3 brothers. We have two        
 televisions. Our favourite t.v.       
 programmes are The A Team, Streat Hawk
 and Gentle Ben. Our brother sometimes 
 goes fishing down the River Clwyd he  
 has caught quite a few. I go with him 
 sometimes.                            
 A typical meal for me and my family   
 would be chips,sausage,peas and bread 
 and butter.I usually drink lemon      
 squash while my parents drink tea.    
{I go to the local school and I like   
{playing in the recreation ground.I    
{mostly play football. }               
 I get up at half past seven and at    
 quarter to eight, I deliver the papers
 for a few of the villagers.I get 30p a
 week for this.                        </content>
