		<content>  The village has one policeman        
 ,P.C.Lewis,who is based in the village
 Police Station.                       
  The policeman can patrol the village 
 in his panda car,keeping and eye out  
 for people to assist and to solve     
 problems. One of his duties involves  
 visiting the school to inform pupils  
 on many things of importance,such as  
 road saftey,and the importance of not 
 accepting lifts from strangers.       
  On occasions,however,P.C. Lewis has  
 more demanding work to undertake,when 
 crimes have been committed.Vandals    
 often damage some of the village's    
 amenties and the policeman has to     
 investigate.Also there are an         
 increasing number of house break-ins  
 in the village.These are the          
 policeman's greatest problems as they 
 seem to be carried out by a well      
 organised gang.                       </content>
