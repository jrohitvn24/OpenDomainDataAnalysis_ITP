		<content>   Hereford x Friesian are kept on most
 farms predominantly not engaged in    
 milk selling. Calves are reared to 18 
 months and sold for fattening else-   
 where. There are four Friesian herds. 
{Milk quotas introduced in April 1984  
{severely affected the income of dairy 
{farmers.}The milk goes to Minsterley  
 Creamery.                             
   Silage and hay are made for winter  
 fodder, also oats &amp; barley are grown. 
   There is a flourishing interest in  
{Anglo-Nubian goats.}Sizes of herds    
 vary between 2-28. Milk is produced   
 for home consumption or frozen and    
 marketed.                             
  One farm breeds Saddleback x Landrace
 pigs which are sold as weaners. The   
 family pig is fattened on 5 holdings. 
   There is a{tendency nowadays for    
{unviable farms to be sold &amp; added to  
{larger units.                         </content>
