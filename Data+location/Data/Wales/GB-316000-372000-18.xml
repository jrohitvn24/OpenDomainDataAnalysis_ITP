		<content>  Children play football, netball,     
 British bull dog, stuck in the mud, or
 cricket. Boys mostly play football,   
 cricket, british bull dogs, and stuck 
 in the mud. Girls mostly play netball,
 British bull dogs and stuck in the    
 mud.About five girls play football.I  
 like football i think its the best    
 game.You play football by kicking the 
 ball in each goal at each other.To    
 play netball you bounce the ball on   
 the floor. when you get to the net you
 throw the ball in a net.You play      
 british bull dogs by calling somone.  
 They have to make it to the other end 
 if he gets caught, he helps the other 
 person. If he makes it eyery one can  
 run to the other end.To play stuck in 
 the mud you run; if the monster       
 catches you three times you will be   
 stuck.
