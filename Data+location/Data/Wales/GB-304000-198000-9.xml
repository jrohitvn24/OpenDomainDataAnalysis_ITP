		<title>09DYSENTRY IN MOUNTAIN ASH</title>
		<content> During the Spring of 1985 pupils in   
 several schools,including Pengeulan   
 Primary,suffered mysterious outbreaks 
 of sickness and diarrhoea.The mystery 
 illness was diagnosed as a mild form  
 of {dysentry.}As a result all the     
 schools affected were closed and all  
 pupils, whether infected or not,were  
 told to stay at home and not return   
 until the disease had subsided.{Our   
{school was closed for three weeks}    
 and everything was washed with        
 disinfectant.It was widely reported   
 in the Welsh daily newspapers and on  
 BBC and HTV Wales news programmes.    
 Water supplies and school canteens    
 were tested for traces of the         
 bacteria, but no reason for the       
 outbreak could be found.Fortunately   
 however,the disease disappeared just  
 as quickly and as mysteriously as it  
 had arrived.                          </content>
