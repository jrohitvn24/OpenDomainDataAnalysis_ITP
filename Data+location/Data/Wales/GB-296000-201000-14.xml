		<title>14Tourist Attraction</title>
		<content>   The country park in Cwmdare is a    
 tourist attraction of this area.      
    There are many ways to enjoy a     
 visit here.One is to explore the area 
 on foot looking at trees such as      
 beech,sycamore and oak.The park has   
 wildlife such as birds,squirrels and  
 foxes.Wildlife in the lakes and       
 reservoirs consists of trout, frogs,  
 snails etc.                           
    The adventure playground,barbecue  
 area,cafe and B.M.X. track are other  
 attractions.Lately there has been     
 "uproar" due to lack of staff to keep 
 these amenities open.The local paper  
 says the park "is fast becoming a     
 white elephant."The appointment of a  
 full time assistant will ensure that  
 the park will cater for this summer's 
 tourists.                             
    Altogether the park is an          
 interesting and attractive area.      </content>
