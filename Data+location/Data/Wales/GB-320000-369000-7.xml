		<content> At school we are given homework every 
 day; we are supposed to have three    
 different subjects each night, but we 
 don't always get that much. Some of us
 try to do our homework in school      
 rather than taking it home. This is   
 the amount of time, on average, we    
 spend on homework each night:         
                                       
      15 - 30 minutes: 18%             
      30 - 45 minutes: 15%             
      45 - 60 minutes: 61%             
 more than 60 minutes:  6%             
                                       
 According to our teachers we are      
 supposed to do between 1 hour and 1   
 hour 30 minutes homework per night.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
