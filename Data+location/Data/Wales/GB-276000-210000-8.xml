         In our area there are numerous
  chapels,one catholic church and two  
 Church in Wales (Church of England    
 Churches).The catholic church is      
 easily the best supported.The         
 non-conformist churches,all built in  
 late ninetenth or early twentieth     
 century,all have dwindling            
 congregations as have the two churches
 due to religious apathy,especially by 
 the younger generation and possibly   
 because there are too many of them in 
 a small area.                         
         All schools in the area have a
 daily non-denominational service.There
 is also compulsory religious education
 in every school.
