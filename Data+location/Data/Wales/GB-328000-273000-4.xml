		<content> The wooded slopes provide shelter from
 the strong winds and driving rain for 
 a rich variety of wild life, while    
 springs and streams ensure a plentiful
 supply of water. Birds seen include:- 
 buzzard, sparrow hawk, kestrel, raven,
 woodpecker, warbler, owl, tit, heron, 
 crow. Mammals include deer, badger,   
 fox, hare, rabbit, rat, mice and      
 shrew. There are also lizards, newts, 
 and snakes including adders. The whole
 area is criss crossed by footpaths,   
 including an ancient ridgeway still in
 use since Roman times. Stowe church-  
 yard and surrounding fields are noted 
 for the numbers of massive ancient yew
 trees. Felled hillsides are colonised 
 by rhododendron, broom, foxglove, and 
 dense carpets of bluebells. Twenty    
 species of flower were found on Caer  
 Caradoc. Less common flora include    
 spindle, centuary, and purple orchid. </content>
