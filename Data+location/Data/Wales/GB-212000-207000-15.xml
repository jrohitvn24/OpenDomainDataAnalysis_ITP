		<title>15The Glass Factory.</title>
		<content> Helen Brush writes : "On the 2lst May,
 l985 we went to see Avondale Glass    
 Factory.  Wendy Speranza said glass is
 made of sand and was probably invented
 in a hot country when the sand melted.
 She and her husband who run the       
 factory are open during the summer    
 months.  We saw her husband make a    
 glass swan.  He is Italian and glass  
 making was a family tradition.  They  
 looked for sites all over Britain and 
 finally chose Kilgetty partly because 
 of a government grant.  They live next
 door and the son is learning the      
 craft.  Coach loads of visitors come  
 to see the place and some buy the     
 ornaments made.  Children can have a  
 go at glass blowing."
