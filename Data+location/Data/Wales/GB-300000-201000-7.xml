   Aberdare is a town built in a valley
 situation on the confluence of the    
 rivers Dare and Cynon.The site is the 
 most accessible point in the north of 
 the Cynon Valley,being located on a   
 bridging point of the river.The town  
 is therefore a route centre and a     
 focus for regional and local bus      
 services.                             
   The shopping area is centred around 
 three streets - Commercial Street,    
 Canon Street and Market Street.As a   
 shopping centre Aberdare provides a   
 wide range of goods,from milk and     
 bread to higher order items such as   
 carpets and furniture.A shop door     
 questionnaire revealed that out of 50 
 people surveyed,72% bought the bulk of
 their shopping at the centre and 62%  
 bought most of their durable goods    
 there also.                           </content>
