		<title>13EVENTS-SCHOOL EISTEDDFOD</title>
		<content>      On March lst, our school holds an
 annual event called an Eisteddfod.    
 This is a Welsh custom and is held to 
 celebrate St. David's Day. St. David  
 is the patron saint of Wales.         
      All the girls wear special       
 costumes of long black and white check
 skirts, white blouses, tall black hats
 and a check shawl.  We wear a leaf of 
 daffodil on March lst as they are our 
 national emblems.                     
      In our school eisteddfod children
 compete against each other for points 
 for their house. This year, l985,     
 Gwent won the shield for the house    
 gaining most points. Competitions were
 held in music, art, craft, knitting,  
 handwriting, poetry and story writing.
      A cookery competition is judged  
 after which the cakes are sold and    
 this year the money received was      
 donated to the Mayor's charity.       </content>
