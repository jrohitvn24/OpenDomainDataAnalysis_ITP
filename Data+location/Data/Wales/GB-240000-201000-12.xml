		<title>12Pembrey C.P. School</title>
		<content>     Pembrey Board School was opened in
 April 1876. That year there were 214  
 pupils on roll and the monthly fees   
 were Â£7-2-6d!                         
   The new Pembrey C.P. School was     
 completed in April 1969 and the pupils
 arrived in May. It is a modern wooden 
 framed building, two storeys high for 
 the junior department and one storey  
 for the infants. There will be 170    
 children on roll in September 1985.The
 old, stone-built school still stands  
 on the school campus and was used     
 until last year for the pre-reception 
 class. Unfortunately the class was    
 closed because of shortage of money.  
    There is a thriving PTA in the     
 school which has raised money for many
 extra pieces of equipment which Dyfed 
 Education Authority are unable to     
 supply.
