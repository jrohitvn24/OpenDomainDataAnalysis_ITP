		<title>06CARNIVAL DAY IN LLANGADOG</title>
		<content> Carnival day is an exciting day in    
 Llangadog.It's usually held on the    
 first Saturday of July as it's always 
 fine on that date.This year (1985) it 
 will be held on the 6th July.On the   
 morning of the carnival people rush to
 prepare the lorries which carry Prince
 Charming,Fairy,Rose &amp; Carnival Queens 
 and attendants.These were chosen at a 
 concert in the Community Centre in    
 May.At 1.30 p.m the lorries decorated 
 with flowers and carrying the Queens  
 parade through the village to the     
 playing field.Many watch the parade as
 it passes through the village square. 
 On the field,the Queens are crowned   
 and the fancy dress winners are       
 chosen.Later there are Sports for the 
 children whilst the adults drink tea. 
 This tiring but happy day ends with a 
 Disco Dance at the Community Centre.
