		<title>15Monmouth's Local Paper</title>
		<content> The{"Monmouthshire Beacon"}serves the 
 town and a large rural area. Founded  
 in 1837 it was owned privately until  
 1980.An editor and reporter and       
 fifteen others are{employed}on this   
 weekly paper.{Printing}is done by the 
 modern "Photo Composition" method.The 
 paper is available on Fridays,and     
 recently a{"Beacon Extra"}on          
 Tuesdays.{Adverts}make up half the    
 paper and five people deal solely with
 setting the advert spaces.            
  The leading articles deal mainly with
{local issues,}much of the news though 
 is sent in by{local organisations}such
 as W.I's, Schools, reports from       
 council meetings, school governors'   
 meetings and the like.                
{ Local people}are very much "Beacon"  
 readers moreso than the larger county 
 paper.{Circulation}is about 5,500     
 copies weekly.                        </content>
