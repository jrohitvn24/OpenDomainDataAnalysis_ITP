    The local population are vey       
 concerned with the poor state of      
 public footpaths, and lack of signs   
 leading to the Offas Dyke path. This  
 is a tourist area, people of many     
 nationalities come to the area and    
 experience much difficulty in this    
 direction.                            
   TRANSPORT.                          
    Although there is a reasonable bus 
 service in the area, it is very       
 expensive, and here the community     
 spirit is shown, neighbours will give 
 lifts freely to those who do not have 
 their own transport.                  
   DISCUSSION.                         
    The two pubs are the main meeting  
 places of the local farmers where they
 discuss the prices of animals sold at 
 the cattle markets, the cost of animal
 feed, harvest and other topics.       </content>
