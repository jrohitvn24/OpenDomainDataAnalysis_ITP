		<title>05LOCAL HISTORY-BUTETOWN</title>
		<content>  Industrial development of the 19th   
 Century paid little heed to any form  
 of planning and houses were generally 
 built in a haphazard fashion.However, 
 Butetown is an exception to the       
 rule.Built between 1802 and 1804 it   
 was originally intended as a{model    
{village}to accommodate the workers of 
 the nearby Union Ironworks.Its Welsh  
 name,{Trefnewyd},Newtown,gives an     
 indication of the overall scheme.     
  The houses themselves are of an      
 impressive terraced layout with both  
 two and three storey blocks built on  
 both sides of a very wide road,which  
 points in the direction of the        
 ironworks.In the last decade, the     
 houses have been completely modernised
 internally and still appear to be an  
 impressive example of industrial 19th 
 Century  architecture.
