		<title>05Homes and houses in Flint</title>
		<content> The old town of Flint is growing, with
{new housing estates}being built on the
 outskirts of the town. Most of the    
 residents are owner occupiers and     
 council house tenants are now having  
 the chance to buy their own homes from
 the council. The town's{skyline}is    
 dominted by three{high rise blocks}of 
 flats- Richard, Bolingbroke and Castle
 Heights (the names have links with the
 town's history). Next to the tower    
 blocks, in the town centre, we have   
 rows of{maisonettes.}                 
 Many of the town's{houses}have had    
 home improvements made to them like   
 double glazing and roof and wall      
 insulation. We carried out a{housing} 
{survey}involving the pupils in our    
 school: 50% have central heating in   
 their homes, 62% are heated by gas,   
 18% by coal, 18% by electricity, and  
 only 2% by oil.                       </content>
