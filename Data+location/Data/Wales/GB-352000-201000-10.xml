		<title>10BROCKWEIR VILLAGE HISTORY</title>
		<content>   The village of Brockweir was part of
 the land owned by the monks of Tintern
 Abbey.A roadway known as Monk's Way   
 linked it to Tintern where there was a
 ferry crossing.The village has buildi-
 ngs of many different ages scattered  
 over the hillsides and linked by narr-
 ow lanes.Only one of the houses, Box  
 Cottage remains unchanged,the rest    
 have been renovated and extended.     
    Brockweir was an important inland  
 port as the River Wye is tidal as far 
 as Bigsweir.It was a route to Chepstow
 one of the largest local ports.There  
 were many barges or trows carrying    
 goods up and down the river.It had    
 sixteen cider houses,today there is   
 one pub.When the railway opened in    
 1876 the river traffic ceased.Today   
 the river is used mainly by fishermen 
 and canoeists.
