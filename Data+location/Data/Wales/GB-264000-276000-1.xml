		<title>01Llanfihangel to Capel Seion</title>
		<content> A quiet rural, sparsely populated &amp;   
 mainly Welsh speaking area of small   
 family farms. There are two distinct  
 communities in the area, one in       
 Llanfihangel which is a small         
 contained village, the other the strip
 development along the main road from  
 Pisgah to Capel Seion both with few   
 facilities. Work outside farming is of
 a limited nature, consequently most   
 people from the villages &amp; hamlets    
 work in Aberystwyth. There are 2 pubs,
 one or two one-man businesses and a   
 gravel pit in the area. The scenery,  
 flora &amp; fauna are such that tourists  
 are attracted to the area resulting in
 a few families offering bed &amp;         
 breakfast facilities for visitors. The
 social &amp; cultural activities are many 
 and varied, most of which centre round
 the chapels,church &amp; village schools  
 of Llanfihangel &amp; nearby Capel Seion. </content>
