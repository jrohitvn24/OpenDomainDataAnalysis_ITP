		<title>10Craig-yr-Allt Farm.</title>
		<content> Craig-yr-Allt is situated on the      
 mountain track leading from Caerphilly
 to Taffs Well.   It is now a riding   
 school and sheep enterprise known as  
 Rockwood.   It was formerly the site  
 of a colliery and several drift mines.
 In the period 1650-1709 the farmhouse 
 was used as a non-conformist church.  
 The present owners have converted many
 of the old mining buildings into      
 stables as well as erecting a large   
 indoor riding school.                 
 Where the subsidence has occurred due 
 to mining much of the land has been   
 reclaimed, however the scars of mining
 still exist, even in the mountainside 
 of Craig-yr-Allt, some 273m in height.
