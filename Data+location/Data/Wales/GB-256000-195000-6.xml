		<content> Swansea Sound is the name of our local
 radio station,it is only a few hundred
 yards from the school.There are thirty
 people working full time in the       
 station,and forty in all.             
        The station opened in 1974 and 
 last year celebrated its'tenth        
 birthday.There are three recording    
 studios in the building,two that are  
 used for daily programmes and one that
 they use for recording groups or      
 choirs.                               
        One of the D.J's,Mr Gari Owen  
 came to speak to us in school.He      
 presents a Welsh language programme   
 four times a week.The news is also    
 read in Welsh three times a day.He    
 told us that in this area Swansea     
 Sound is the most listened to radio   
 station,with even more listeners than 
 Radio 1.It was very interesting to go 
 and meet the faces behind the voices. </content>
