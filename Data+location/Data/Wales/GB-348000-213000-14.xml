		<title>14 The Baptist Church</title>
		<content>  The Baptist Church in Monmouth was   
formed in 1906.On 25th October,1906 the
first three people in Monmouth were    
baptised in the River Wye.             
  The chapel and its original school   
rooms still remain.The Pastor and 6    
other people make up the Deaconship.The
seven Deacons run the church and they  
are elected every 5 years by the       
members.As well as the normal Sunday   
services,there are a Sunday school,    
Sisterhood and a young people's meeting
  When entering the chapel on a Sunday,
a stranger may be surprised that the   
Pastor is not wearing 'dog-collar'.    
Baptist ministers do not have to wear  
them.                                  
  The church has a very relaxed and    
homely atmosphere.Young people can make
many friends through their attendance  
at the church.
