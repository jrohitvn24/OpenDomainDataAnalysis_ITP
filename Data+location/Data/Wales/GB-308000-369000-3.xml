		<title>03LANGUAGE AT YSGOL BODFARI</title>
		<content> Ysgol Bodfari is a rural school in the
 Vale of Clwyd.In the past the         
 bilingual nature of the school has    
 been very prominent in that a number  
 of children have Welsh as a first     
 language while others have English as 
 their first language.                 
         By 1985 the character of the  
 school and  the village is changing.  
 Out of the sixty full time pupils at  
 school there are only two with both   
 parents speaking Welsh.By next year   
 this figure will be reduced to        
 one.There are a few children in school
 where one parent speaks Welsh but the 
 language spoken at home is English.   
        The children whose first       
 language is English are taught Welsh  
 as a second language.
