 With the reclaiming of the valley the 
 ecology enviroment has changed drama_ 
 tically over the last decade.Before   
 any work was done the area was very   
 barren indeed,except for the decid_   
 uous woodland which had managed to    
 survive the industrial era very few   
 other plants had survived.This was due
 mainly to the vast quantities of unfe_
 rtile mine waste which covered the    
 area.The most common plants at this   
 time were of course{nettles,briers}and
 the{rosebay willowherb.}Now as part of
 the reclaiming there has been an int_ 
 ensive planting programme introducing 
 a variety of native wild flowers and  
 shrubs.The ponds created have also    
 been stocked with native plant and    
 animal life.
