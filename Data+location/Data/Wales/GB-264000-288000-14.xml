 Trees in this area are mostly         
 coniforous and owned by the Forestry  
 Commision,although some are owned     
 privately.The Forestry Commision plant
 mainly conifers because they grow     
 quickly.They are beginning to plant   
 more hardwoods such as beech,sycamore,
 ash and others .These decidious trees 
 attract more wildlife and give more   
 variety.The most popular conifers     
 planted in this area are Sitka Spruce 
 and Lodge Pole Pine.Ninety per cent   
 of the wood is used for paper,and the 
 rest is made into fencing posts and   
 made into building timber.            
     If the mountains around here were 
 not grazed by sheep the lower slopes  
 would be covered by oak forests and   
 the upper slopes would have birch,    
 hazel and rowan growing on them.
