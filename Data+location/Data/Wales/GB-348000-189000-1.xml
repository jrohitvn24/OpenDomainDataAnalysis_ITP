		<content>    This Domesday block consists mainly
 of agricultural land lying between the
 towns of Chepstow and Caldicot in the 
 south-east corner of Gwent.           
                                       
    Two major roads run through the    
 block providing easy communication    
 with Bristol and London via the Severn
 Bridge, and with Newport and Cardiff  
 to the west.                          
                                       
    The village of Mathern lies on the 
 eastern perimeter of this block, and  
 it is from the pupils and parents of  
 the village school that most of the   
 information contained in this entry   
 has been obtained.
