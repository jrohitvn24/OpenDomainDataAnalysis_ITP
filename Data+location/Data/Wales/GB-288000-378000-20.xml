		<title>20Lifeboat &amp; railway stations</title>
		<content> The life-boat station opened in 1869, 
 and in 1890 it helped to rescue       
 passengers off the sinking liner      
 "Ocean Queen".In December 1896 the    
 Weekly News reported the closure of   
 the station,but the Rev.Venables      
 Williams kept the "Mary Jane Gould"   
 running.The station closed in 1932.   
 When he was a boy,Councillor Sidney   
 Morris was photographed in 1906 on the
 boat as it was pulled over the sand by
 horses.He presented the photo to our  
 school.The old boat-house is a private
 house now.                            
   Llanddulas Railway Station was quite
 busy until it became a victim of cuts 
 on Dec.1st.1952.Families were reunited
 on its platform after the war,and     
 local people would gather there to go 
 on shopping trips,or football matches 
 in Liverpool or Manchester.Only the   
 station gate and steps still remain.  </content>
