		<title>10Games we play in Heolgerrig.</title>
		<content>  The most popular game in our school  
 is the snail,quite a few people play  
 it,especially class one and two,it is 
 painted on our school yard in yellow  
 paint and looks like a snail shell    
 with large squares on it.             
  These are there because the players  
 have to hop on one foot in the squares
 without touching the lines with hands 
 or feet.You have to hop on one foot   
 until you reach the finishing         
 space,there you can have a short rest 
 before you hop back to the start to   
 get a square.The square that you have 
 earned will have to be jumped by the  
 other players,but when it is your turn
 again you have to jump other players  
 squares and land on your own squares, 
 on the way to the finish and on the   
 way back.
