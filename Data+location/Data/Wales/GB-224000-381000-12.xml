		<content> On the outskirts of the town is alarge
 aluminium processing plant. The       
 factory was built on part of the      
 Stanley estate.The factory was built  
 at Holyhead to take advantage of the  
 natural deep water harbour which      
 allowed large vessels to disembark the
 necessary raw materials.              
 There has been a steady decline in    
 production as the demand for          
 aluminium receeds.This has had an     
 effect on the number of people        
 employed at the works.Voluntary       
 redundancies have been called for of  
 late.                                 
 Also the price of power has caused    
 production prices to rise which has   
 prompted the company to ask for state 
 aid.This has not materialised so far.
