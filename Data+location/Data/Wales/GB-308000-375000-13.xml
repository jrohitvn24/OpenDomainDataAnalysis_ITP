		<title>13HOPES AND FEARS</title>
		<content> Of the people surveyed the strongest  
 point made was a profound hope that   
 their environment will always stay the
 same. Whilst amenities are totally    
 lacking in the area, peace tranquility
 and a steady pace of life are enjoyed 
 and appreciated by all. The only thing
 they would change is to have a Bus    
 service of some kind in the area. A   
 comment often made was "Our land is   
 our heritage", something they consider
 to be vitally important. The main hope
 of all is that the unemployed, in     
 particular the younger generation will
 one day have the opportunity to gain  
 full employment and a decent standard 
 of living.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
