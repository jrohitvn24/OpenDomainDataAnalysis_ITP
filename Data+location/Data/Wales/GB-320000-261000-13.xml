		<content> ALL DAILY PAPERS ARE AVAILABLE TO     
 PEOPLE IN THIS DISTRICT, BUT THEY     
 FAVOUR LOCAL NEWSPAPERS WHICH ARE     
 HEREFORD TIMES, WESTERN MAIL, THE     
 BRECON AND RADNOR, TIMES GAZETTE AND  
 MID WALES JOURNAL. THE PARISH MAGAZINE
 IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO HOUSEHOLDS, AS IT
 NOT ONLY GIVES NOTICE OF CHURCH       
 SERVICES IT ALSO ADVERTISES LOCAL     
 SOCIAL EVENTS. ALTHOUGH THE AREA IS IN
 WALES, WELSH CHANNELS ARE UNOBTAINABLE
 ON TELEVISION BUT DUE TO A BOOSTER    
 INSTALLED RECENTLY THERE IS GOOD      
 RECEPTION OF BBC AND ITV PROGRAMMES   
 FROM THE MIDLANDS TRANSMITTER. RADIO  
 IS POPULAR. LOCAL RADIO TRANSMISSION  
 IS FROM RADIO WALES, RADIO WYVERN AND 
 RADIO SUNSHINE (LUDLOW).
