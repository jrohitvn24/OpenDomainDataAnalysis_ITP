		<content> Due to the exclusively rural nature of
 the region the variety of topics      
 researched was rather restricted.One  
 of the fastest growing pastimes is    
 undoubtably bird watching,as there are
 many people in Mid Wales interested in
 ornithology.We were able to gain      
 access to the list of birds found     
 within the region in 1900,and it was  
 very interesting to compare that list 
 with the species present today.       
    The amount of woodland has         
 decreased since 1900,and a number of  
 hedges have been taken up on farms.   
    However,on the whole,the nature    
 of the habitat within the block has   
 not altered greatly during the last 85
 years.The changes have not affected   
 the number of species within the      
 region,to any great extent so far.
