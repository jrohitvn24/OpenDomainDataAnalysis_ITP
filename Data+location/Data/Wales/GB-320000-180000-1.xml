		<title>01The Survey Area</title>
		<content>  The area of our survey is mainly made
 up of housing estates,all of them a   
 mixture of council and private,with   
 only small areas of light industry.   
 The area is divided into three in     
 theEast and North East of{Cardiff.}   
{ Llanedeyrn and Pentwyn}are in the    
 North East.They are large housing     
 estates that have been built since the
 late 1960's and early 1970's.A new    
 area is now being built to the north  
 of Pentwyn.                           
  The M4 and River Rumney separate     
 these from {Llanrumney}another large  
 housing estate,dating from the late   
 1950's,in the East of the city.Across 
 the A48(Newport Road),are the other   
 estates of{Rumney,St.Mellons and      
{Trowbridge.}Rumney and St.Mellons date
 from the 1950's or earlier.Trowbridge 
 has grown since the 1960's,while today
 is growing still as the new St.Mellons</content>
