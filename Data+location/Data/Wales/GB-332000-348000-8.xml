		<title>08ERDDIG HALL,WREXHAM</title>
		<content> Erddig Hall, on the south- western    
 edge of Wrexham, was built by Joshua  
 Edisbury between 1684 and 1687. It was
 bought by John Mellor in 1718 and on  
 his death was passed to Simon Yorke   
 and his descendents. The last Yorke to
 live there was Philip Yorke, locally  
 known as Squire Yorke. He gave the    
 hall, by then in a poor state of      
 repair, and 1, 942 acres of land to   
 the National Trust in 1973. Now       
 restored to its former glory the hall 
 with its walled garden stands in      
 magnificent wooded parkland.          
 The rooms contained a collection of   
 mirrors, furniture, a Gainsborough    
 painting, rare porcelain, Chinese     
 paintings and wall coverings,         
 tapestries and a magnificent state    
 bed. The rooms " below stairs " are of
 particular interest showing the way   
 the servants lived.                   </content>
