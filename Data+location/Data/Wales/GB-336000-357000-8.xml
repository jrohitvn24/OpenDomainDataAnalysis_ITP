		<content> In the rural areas on the outskirts of
 Rossett the main buildings are farm   
 buildings some of which are very old. 
                                       
 In the Burton area, just outside      
 Rossett, there are some pre-war       
 semi-detached houses and a small new  
 estate made up of very large detached 
 houses.  They were first built in     
 1980.                                 
                                       
 The housing in Rossett is well spread 
 and varied ranging from very old,     
 large houses to small detached        
 bungalows.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
