		<title>20RECREATION-CUBS AND SCOUTS</title>
		<content>      Pencoed has very good            
 organisations for young people. Many  
 boys from the town belong to one of   
 the 6 cub packs or scout troops that  
 we have. There is also a venture scout
 troop for older boys and girls. There 
 is great enthusiam with the leaders   
 and the scouts hold a number of fund  
 raising events which means they now   
 have their own hut. These units give  
 plenty of opportunities to their      
 members and they have been very       
 successful with their work in the     
 community.                            
      The girl guides have two packs   
 and meet on a regular basis. Again    
 there if great interest shown by the  
 girls and this year they are, in fact,
 celebrating their 75th anniversary.
