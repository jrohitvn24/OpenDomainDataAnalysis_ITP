		<content> The area is dominated by the village  
 of SENNYBRIDGE (PONT SENNI).This is   
 not as old as the adjacent village of 
 Defynnog but grew in the 19th century 
 as the place where the Neath and      
 Brecon railway met the turnpike road  
 (now A 40) in the Usk valley.  This   
 became a convenient place to hold a   
 market and it is this role which is   
 still the most important function of  
 the village.  The railway has long    
 since gone, but the cattle mart is    
 conveniently situated close to the    
 main road.  The importance of the mart
 is further exemplified by the fact    
 that this small village has no fewer  
 than 3 branches of banks (admittedly  
 only open for a few hours each week). 
 The vilage is nearly all spread along 
 the sides of A 40 and the original    
 route of A 4067 to Defynnog.
