		<title>09FARMING</title>
		<content> Nearly all the farms in Risca are     
 hillfarms. Some have horses,cows and  
 sheep. And there is one pig farm. The 
 farms have big feilds, and there are  
 not many farms are at the top of the  
 mountains. There are farmhouses stable
 and haysheds. Most of them have       
 tractors and some of the farms hire   
 machinery to do the harvesting and    
 otherthings. Most of the farmers get  
 up at six oclock to feed the animals. 
 then put grass seed in their fields   
 because none of them grow crops in the
 winter. The pig farm would sell about 
 two pigs a month to be turned into    
 bacon. The cow farms milk their cows  
 every day with a machine that sucks   
 the milk from the udders. the cows    
 that had an affected udder would be   
 connected to a specail tube which     
 injects something to heal the udder
