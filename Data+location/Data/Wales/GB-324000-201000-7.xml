		<content>   We went to interview the{Deputy     
{Administrator}for{Pontypool Hospital. 
  {Pontypool and District Hospital}was 
 built in two stages.  The first part  
 was built in{1907}and the second part 
 was built in{1927.                    
   It serves an area from{Cwmbran to   
{Blaenavon.                            
   The main function of the hospital is
 as{a long-term stay geriatric hospital
 but there is also a ward for use by   
 local doctors.                        
   The hospital is run by the{Gwent    
{Health Authority. }It has an          
 out-patients and minor casualty unit  
 but this is only open 12 hours a day. 
   The hospital does not admit children
 -they are sent to the{Royal Gwent     
{Hospital}in{Newport.                  
   The hospital has no resident doctors
 and there are no plans for rebuilding 
 of the hospital.                      </content>
