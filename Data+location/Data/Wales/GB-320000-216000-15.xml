		<title>15DISASTER ONE AT CRICKHOWELL</title>
		<content> When we started back to school for the
 Autumn Term 1984 we little expected   
 what was ahead of us.                 
 We immediately found that the{central 
{heating installation}which was to have
 been completed during the summer      
 holidays had not even been started. We
 then had to put up with plumbers      
 working and being ready to move out of
 our classrooms at short notice to     
 allow them to work there. When the    
 cold weather came the heating was     
 still not finished and so we had to   
 have mobile gas heaters in the        
 classrooms.                           
 The heating was eventually working in 
 February 1985 after our other two     
 disasters had happened.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
