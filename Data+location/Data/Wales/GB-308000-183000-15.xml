		<title>15PROBLEMS OF THE YOUNG IN 85</title>
		<content> Upon leaving school, Taffs Well looks 
 to be a pretty bleak place to live in.
 School does little to prepare you for 
 the harsh realities of the outside    
 world, frequently leaving you to      
 figure out your rights under the      
 Welfare State on your own.            
 Knowing what money you're entitled to 
 after leaving school is vitally       
 important in such an area, as full    
 time jobs are few and far between.    
 Local industry is dead, and the choice
 seems to be between leaving Taffs Well
 to look for work, or staying in the   
 area and finding place on the YTS.    
 The social life of the area is as run 
 down as it's industrial life. Apart   
 from the youth clubs, which cater     
 primarily to those still at school,   
 there is very little of interest to   
 the young adult.
