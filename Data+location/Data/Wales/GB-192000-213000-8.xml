		<content> The castle was built on top of a rocky
 headland overlooking the river, at an 
 unknown date early in the 12th        
 century. The present building dates   
 from the 13th century with a few later
 additions. The castle today gives a   
 good indication of the original site. 
 The ground falls away steeply to the  
 east down to the river and gives a    
 commanding position in the town. To   
 the south, stepped banks lead down to 
 the car park, which may have been the 
 site of a moat.                       
     the building which houses the     
 museum and record office dates from   
 18th and 19th centuries and was used  
 as the County Prison before           
 modernisation.                        
   The Castle fell into disuse about   
 1532 and was partially destroyed on   
 the orders of Cromwell in 1648.
