   Some of the industries which we have
 seen are{:Velindre}tinplating         
 industry;J.R.Steels;Honda/SAAB        
 garage;Silconix;shops in              
 Morriston;small shops like            
 hairdressers and newsagents in        
 Cwmrhydyceirw and Ynysforgan.         
   Some recently closed places include 
 the{quarry}at Cwmrhydyceirw and the   
 CO-OP. at Parc Gwernfadog.            
   The{Hospital}employs a lot of       
 people,some of the porters there are  
 redundant steel workers.              
   Local schools and hotels,such as the
 Gwernfadog hotel,also employ people.  
   Quite a few people have vans parked 
 outside their houses-e.g.video sales  
 vans or driving school cars.          
   We are within easy reach of most    
 areas,so many of us travel to outlying
 areas to do our work.                 </content>
