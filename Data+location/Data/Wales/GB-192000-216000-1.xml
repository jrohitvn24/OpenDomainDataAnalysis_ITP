		<content>    Haverfordwest, with all the        
 roads leading to it, is the centre of 
 Pembrokeshire, as it is so well       
 placed. Roads come in from Fishguard, 
 Milford Haven, Pembroke, Cardigan,    
 Carmarthen and St.David's.            
    The only parts of Haverfordwest    
 coming into our project area include:_
         {**  Prendergast  **          
    This place used to be a separate   
 village. There is a main A-road which 
 passes through to Fishguard, having a 
 B-road forking off it to Cardigan.    
    Farms at{** Pelcomb **}&amp; else-where
 are quite small (with old buildings)  
 having just little more than country  
 lanes joining them to other farms &amp;   
 very small hamlets. Passing through   
 Pelcomb is an A-road to St.David's.   
     {**  Hamlet of St.Martin  **      
 (area as far north as Pelcomb Bridge) 
 possesses its OWN Community Council.  </content>
