		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION,LYDART</title>
		<content> Our 'block' is a rural landscape with 
 the edge of the village of Penallt to 
 the east,and part of Mitchel Troy     
 to the west. We are three miles from  
 Monmouth and the Wye Valley,and have  
 wonderful views of the Brecon Beacons 
 and Black Mountains to the west. The  
 central part of this area is called   
 Lydart,so we shall refer to the whole 
 'block' by this name.                 
 We have a mixture of small farms and  
 Forestry Commission woods,modern      
 housing,traditional Welsh longhouses  
 and abandoned,derelict farm labourers 
 cottages.                             
 Lydart is typical of rural Britain;we 
 have a 'Pick Your Own' fruit farm;some
 families do 'Bed &amp; Breakfast for      
 tourists;we have a W.I. and cricket   
 club;convent and pub;local children go
 to school in Penallt or Mitchel Troy  
 while their mothers shop in Monmouth. </content>
