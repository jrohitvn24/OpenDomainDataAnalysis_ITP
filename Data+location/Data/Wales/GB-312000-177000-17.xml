		<title>17A walk in the Country.</title>
		<content> On the 17th of May, 1985, classes 2   
 and 3 went for a walk for the Domesday
 Project, with their teachers, Mr      
 Mantle and Mr Burns. Everyone had maps
 at the ready. We all gathered up      
 inside the school and off we trooped! 
 My partner was Craig Rees but we ended
 up with Neil Spragg as well. We walked
 to the playground to the wall which   
 led us to the field. As the sun was   
 beaming down on the earth, my mum put 
 me in shorts, but someone had not     
 bothered to cut the grass, so the ones
 wearing shorts and skirts were in for 
 a pretty itchy time! Along we         
 trecked until the ground became hard. 
 Soon the grass had formed a hard,     
 rough, dusty surface, with stones all 
 over the place. I was free from itchy 
 grass on my legs so now I could have a
 nice, relaxing chat with Craig &amp; Neil.
