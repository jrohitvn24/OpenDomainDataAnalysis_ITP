		<content>    Situated near the village square,  
 the community centre provides a focus 
 for many members of the local         
 community, both young and old.        
    Groups which use the building and  
 its amenities include the playschool, 
 the Old Age Pensioners and the Youth  
 Club. A recent development has been   
 the conversion of the building        
 nextdoor to the centre as an annexe,  
 providing much needed extra space for 
 the twice weekly youth meetings.      
    Day and evening classes in adult   
 education are also run at the centre. 
 Subjects covered range from hobbies   
 and interests such as keep-fit, yoga  
 and dressmaking, to language courses  
 and computer studies. There is also a 
 twice-weekly library.                 
    The centre also provides a venue   
 for the fortnightly children's and    
 chiropody clinics.                    </content>
