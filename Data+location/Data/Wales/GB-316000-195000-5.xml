		<content>     Formerly a coal mining area with  
 many small levels. These were replaced
 by deep shaft mines but many now      
 closed, Oakdale Colliery remains.     
 Light, mixed industries tend to be    
 concentrated on industrial estates as 
 at Pontllanfraith.                    
     Earlier industrial housing was    
 terraced but with growth of housing   
 estates, the estate agents and        
 building society offices have grown in
 number.                               
     The area has tended to be         
 socialist due to its industrial       
 nature. The chartist movement of 1839 
 developed here as did the Labour      
 movement of the early 20th century.   
     Neil Kinnock, the leader of the   
 Labour party, is the member of        
 parliament for the Bedwellty          
 constituency which includes this area.
