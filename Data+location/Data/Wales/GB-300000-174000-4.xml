     Everybody disliked the cost of    
 public transport &amp; most people felt   
 Maendy would be improved by mains     
 drainage &amp; better sporting facilities.
     There are some retired people in  
 Maendy but most adults work, the      
 majority in Cardiff &amp; most households 
 had 2 cars.                           
     Though Maendy is in the country,  
 there was little involvement in       
 hunting &amp; shooting, the majority of   
 people being opposed, but fishing was 
 more popular.
