		<content> There are two places of Worship in our
 area,Maesyronnen Chapel (U.R.C.)and St
 Meilig's Church, Llowes.              
{Maesyronnen,}built in 1696 is one of  
 the earliest chapels in Wales.Despite 
 its secluded position it is still very
 active,with weekly services attended  
 by about 20 people and monthly bible  
 study,prayer,business and social      
 meetings.For communion,members sit    
 around an oak table with the minister 
 at the head.18th century pewter cups &amp;
 plate are used.Box family pews and    
 backless benches are also in use.     
{St.Meilig's Church}was rebuilt in 1853
 St Meilig's 7ft.stone slab cross and  
 13th century stone font, are at the   
 rear.The register shows that about 8  
 people attend each Sunday with 2      
 funerals and 1 wedding per year.They  
 need Â£10,000 for repairs.
