		<title>09FARMING AND RECREATION</title>
		<content> As the majority of the people surveyed
 in the area are farmers they find     
 little time to enjoy many activities  
 after their long working days. This is
 particularly so in the Spring and     
 Summer months when they might enjoy   
 one or two days break only to visit an
 Agricultural Show. The non-farming    
 community have varied hobbies ranging 
 from Shooting, Fishing, Walking to    
 Sailing. Flying is enjoyed by two     
 people in the area involving a round  
 trip of l26 miles to the Mona Flying  
 School on the Isle of Anglesey.       
 In the Winter months reading is the   
 main leisure with time also available 
 for playing popular games such as     
 draughts ludo,and cards with the      
 children. Computers and software are  
 now becoming very popular with the    
 adults as well as the children.
