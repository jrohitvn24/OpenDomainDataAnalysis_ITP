		<title>08EVENTS : SWANSEA WEST</title>
		<content> School fetes are popular money-making 
 events. They include bizarre          
 activities such as welly-throwing     
 competitions,and at Hendrefoilan      
 School there is a stall where wet     
 sponges are thrown at a teacher.      
                                       
 One Saturday in June 1985, All Souls  
 Brownies went to Cwrt Sart School,    
 Neath where they took part in singing 
 and other activities to celebrate 75  
 years of the Girl Guide Movement.     
 There are also Scouts,Cub Scouts,Air  
 Cadets and the Boys' Brigade in our   
 area.                                 
                                       
 Other events include Cockett          
 Festival,garden parties and fun runs, 
 all of which are held annually.
