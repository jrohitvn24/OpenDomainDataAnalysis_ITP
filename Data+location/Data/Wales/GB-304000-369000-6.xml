 Trefnant, it's owner is Mr. Edward    
 Gwyn Humpreys who lives there with his
 wife,Marlene, and his daughter Catrin 
 Elenor. He has been managing the shop 
 for 12 months, and has planning       
 permission to knock a wall down to    
 extend the shop. His wife runs the    
 hairdressers next door, and just down 
 the road there is an old telephone    
 exchange which she would like to      
 convert into a hairdressers. Between  
 six and eight in the morning is treir 
 busiest time as everyone comes in to  
 get the morning newspapers, especially
 the farmers as they are up so early.  
 He had been in the Police Force for   
 four years but had decided to start   
 his own business as a shopkeeper. They
 were friendly people and he enjoyed   
 his work a lot.
