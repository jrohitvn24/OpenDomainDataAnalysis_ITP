{FAMILY,CAREW.                         
  On Sunday my dad goes to work as a   
 tiler at 8.30am.In the afternoon,if it
 is fine,he goes to watch cricket.     
  I go to Sunday School at 11.00am and 
 when I get home at 12.00am my lunch is
 waiting.It consists of lamb,potatoes, 
 peas,carrots and cauliflower.         
  Sunday afternoon I visit the local   
 market and then go to the cricket.    
  My brother does not get up until     
 11.00am because he is a disc jockey on
 Saturday nights.In the afternoon he   
 goes jalopy racing.                   
  At nights the family stays in to     
 watch T.V.Sometimes we go for a drive 
 My brother goes out with his friends. 
  On Sunday mum stays at home to cook  
 dinner and do her books ready for work
 on Monday.
