		<title>14Natural History of the woods</title>
		<content>  A variety of interesting woodland and
 farmland wildlife occur.{Polecats,    
{Grey Squirels,}and{Foxes}are all      
 common. The{Polecat}is rarely seen    
 because it is nocturnal. Birds of prey
 are well represented as the natural   
{Oak}woods provide ideal nesting       
 habitats while the absence of         
 gamekeepers means they have fewer     
 threats from man. The{Buzzard}occurs  
 in large numbers, as many as 18       
{Buzzards}having been seen hunting for 
 worms on a field near Llangeitho. The 
 rare{Red Kite}is still quite common   
 around Llangeitho and at anytime of   
 the year it may be seen swooping low  
 over the village. On Llangeitho Show  
 day it is nearly always seen circling 
 overhead. People act as an actual lure
 for the kite. Other birds of prey     
 found around Llangeitho are the       
 dashing{Sparrowhawk}and the{Tawny Owl.</content>
