		<title>12RHYMNEY VALLEY-ECOLOGY (2)</title>
		<content>   In the Rhymney Valley, kingfishers  
 are now found to be nesting along the 
 river banks and the peregrine has been
 observed in the upland regions.       
   Mammals, which have made an         
 appearance, include foxes,hedgehogs,  
 rabbits and moles, with the upland    
 region supporting                     
 hares,badgers,weasles and stoats.     
   The Heads of the Valleys Road has   
 provided a haven for the small        
 rodents,                              
 with sparrowhawks and kestrels being  
 frequent visitors.                    
   Although there are a number of well 
 established trees in the valley       
 bottoms,there has been a conscious    
 effort by the Authority to plant trees
 in other  areas.                      
   The River Rhymney is, once again,   
 supporting fish and, in some          
 stretches, trout can be found.        </content>
