		<title>20A day in the life of Rhys.</title>
		<content> A typical day begins when I get up at 
 7.20 a.m. I go downstairs and switch  
 on the T.V. to watch "Popeye". Mammy  
 gets up at 7.30 and makes breakfast.  
 At 7.45 I wake my father and I eat    
 breakfast. At 8.30 I walk 200m. to    
 school. Before school begins I play   
 football on the yard. The bell goes at
 9.00 and I go into the classroom, then
 the class goes into the hall for      
 assembly. Service over we return to   
 the classroom for lessons. At 10.30 we
 have play, we go back at 10.45 for    
 more lessons. At 12.00 I go home for  
 lunch. I am back in school by 12.30.  
 Then it is more lessons from 1.00     
 until 3.30 with a break at 2.15 until 
 2.25. When I reach home I do my school
 homework, then I watch T.V. until     
 dinner at 6.30.. I watch T.V. again,  
 then I go and practise my trumpet and 
 electric organ. I go to bed at 9.30.. </content>
