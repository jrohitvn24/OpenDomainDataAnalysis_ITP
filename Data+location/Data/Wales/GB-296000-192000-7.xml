{                                      
   Today I am going to school.  It is  
 Friday and there is mass.  I am going 
 to read the hallelujah today.  I walk 
 into Church and go and sit in the     
 front seat with my friends who are    
 doing other readings.                 
   When it is my turn, I go up and read
 as well as I can.  When mass is over  
 we leave the Church and return to     
 school which is in the same yard. We  
 do our work, then we say our prayers. 
 The bell rings and we go to the       
 canteen to eat our dinner.            
   In the afternoon we have Mrs.Bowen  
 and we go out for games and do art.   
 When it is time to go home we say our 
 prayers and go home for tea.
