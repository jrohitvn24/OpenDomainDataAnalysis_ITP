		<title>14Cilcain:Employment/Commuting</title>
		<content> In the 19th century most local people 
 worked in the immediate vicinity, many
 being employed on farms, some in lead-
 mining and others providing goods and 
 services for the rural population.    
 Now there are some jobs at nearby     
 limestone quarries, but mechanization 
 on farms means that far fewer people  
 gain a living from agriculture. The   
 shops, public-houses, school and a few
 small businesses, such as a riding-   
 stables and a mobile blacksmith,      
 provide a few jobs locally, but most  
 residents have to find work outside   
 the villages. Many are employed in the
 Mold area, but some commute longer    
 distances to work in Chester, Deeside,
 or Merseyside. Recent improvements to 
 the main roads of the area mean such a
 journey does not take long by car, and
 these people value life in this rural 
 environment above the costs of travel.</content>
