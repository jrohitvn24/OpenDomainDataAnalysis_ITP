		<title>18CHILDRENS LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content> Children's leisure time was mainly    
 centred within the locality and varied
 according to age. There are no longer 
 cinema facilities in our area the     
 cinemas having long given way to bingo
 halls so entertainment was limited. in
 the seven to ten age group the main   
 interests appear to be bicycle riding,
 swimming, the use of the local parks, 
 particularly those with swings and    
 roundabouts, playing pop records,     
 watching video films and Brownie and  
 Cub movements. In the eleven to       
 fourteen age group, the interests were
 disco dancing, scout and guides,      
 sports, youth clubs and home          
 computers. Some children have horses  
 which they ride. In most areas like   
 our own there are community centres   
 financed by the local council and in  
 these centres more organised          
 activities take place.                </content>
