 A   The most noticeable change has    
 been the attitude of the children

 number of pupils from 500, when I     
 first came here ,to over 800 pupils.

 A   Yes, the woodwork and metalwork   
 rooms were opened in 1960 and the     
 craft and technical drawing room in   
 1972. Since then there has been no    
 additions except mobile classrooms.
