		<title>08What we Play at School.</title>
		<content> All the boys over seven years old play
 in the top playground and we have to  
 be with all the little ones in the    
 bottom playground and we cannot play  
 fast games.Sometimes we play Hopscotch
 and have a small pitch chalked on the 
 ground,sometimes Tip where we chase   
 others,touch them so that they are 'on
 it'and have to chase,we skip a lot    
 with two turning the rope and we skip 
 in and out,but our favorite is        
 'Elastics'when two stretch the elastic
 between them,we jump in or out taking 
 one side of the elastic loop over the 
 other and undoing it.                 
 The boys play a lot of football,some  
 Hide and Seek.They like playing       
 British Bulldog when one starts       
 standing in the middle,all others race
 from one end to the other,middle man  
 catches if he can and shouts "British 
 Bulldog,1,2,3!"and then those catch.  </content>
