		<title>04What is Spoken in Newport.</title>
		<content> I think many people think that Newport
 has very little Welsh spoken.We are   
 taught both English and Welsh from our
 first day at school and we learn some 
 things through Welsh.Grown-ups also   
 have a chance of learning it in       
 evening class.I think it is only about
 12 children that sometimes play in    
 Welsh.We don't use any other          
 language.We get a terrible row for bad
 language,it's nearly as bad as        
 stealing or telling lies!We don't get 
 a row for not speaking Welsh,the      
 teachers nag us a lot to try more but 
 it is difficult unless we are         
 Llangrannog Urdd Camp or Pendine on a 
 Welsh course.We can understand nearly 
 everything.                           
 Everybody in Newport answered         
 questions:45% had both parents        
 speaking Welsh;38%now speak fluent,20%
 fair,17% understand only,25% no Welsh.</content>
