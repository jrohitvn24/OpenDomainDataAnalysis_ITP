		<content> Fifty years ago nearly everyone in the
 village was Welsh-speaking. Some of   
 the older people could not speak any  
 English. In school only English was   
 allowed in the classroom and the      
 children were punished if they spoke  
 Welsh. Outside school the children    
 spoke Welsh and found it difficult to 
 do their work in English. In 1985 the 
 situation is very different. More than
 half of the people who live in the    
 village are unable to speak Welsh,    
 whilst in school most of the children 
 use English as their first language.  
 Although most of the children speak   
 Welsh fluently before they leave the  
 village school at the age of eleven,  
 they do not use the language for play 
 or when they meet in the street. There
 is more interest in the language today
 than ever before and money to publish 
 books is provided by the Common Market</content>
