		<content>{The area covered by this survey is    
 400 kilometres above sea level.The    
 land is largely covered by rough      
 grazing,so sheep are a major factor of
 the area .The attractive bleakness of 
 the landscape is broken up by the     
  Forestry Commision. The area is rich 
 in minerals as it used to be the      
 centre of lead mining.The quarrying is
 still carried out here .There are     
 three villages in the area            
 Bwlchgwyn,Gwynfrynand the largest     
 Minera.None of these have many        
 services and they have to depend on   
 Coedpoeth,the adjoining village,or on 
 Wrexham,6 miles away.Public transport 
 is acceptable during the day,but a car
 is essential in this rural district
