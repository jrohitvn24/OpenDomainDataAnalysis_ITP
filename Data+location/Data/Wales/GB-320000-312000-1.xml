		<content> Guilsfield Without is an area of      
 farmland to the north of the village  
 of Guilsfield in Mid-Wales.It is about
 ten miles from the English border,and 
 approximately 18 miles west of        
 Shrewsbury.The block surveyed is      
 rather typical of the surrounding     
 Welsh countryside.It is an area of    
 undulating hills separated by mature  
 river valleys.                        
              Guilsfield Without lies  
 between the valleys of the Severn and 
 the Vyrnwy.The highest point is       
 250m(a.s.l)and roughly 2/3rds is over 
 150m(a.s.l).There are 5 small streams,
 but no river of any size flows through
 the block.The land is exclusively used
 for farming ,with 30 farms of varying 
 size within the region. The square    
 23,12 lies below the rest of the      
 region in the valley.
