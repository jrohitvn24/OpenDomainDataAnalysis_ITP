		<title>10Minera Quarry to motorway</title>
		<content>  High explosive is placed into holes  
 drilled into the rock.Detonators are  
 attached and the explosion will bring 
 down thousands of tons of rock.The    
 stone is loaded into huge trucks by   
 mechanical shovels.It goes to the     
 crushing plant where big pieces are   
 broken.It goes through other crushers 
 and it gets sorted into batches of    
 different sized aggregate which are   
 stored in hoppers.                    
  Asphalt,which is used in road making 
 ,is made at the quarry.The right      
 amount of aggregate is mixed with a   
 binder.The binder is bitumen, which is
 a tar-like substance which comes from 
 crude petroleum refining.It is brought
 to the quarry in large tankers.       
   Rock and asphalt from Minera Quarry 
 have been used to construct motorways 
 like the M.56 and the M.53.
