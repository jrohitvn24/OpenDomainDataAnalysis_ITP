    COUNTRY ROADS ARE VERY DANGEROUS   
 AND WE HAVE HAD A FEW ACCIDENTS ON    
 THEM.WE WERE COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL  
 AND WE WERE GOING VERY SLOWLY AND AS  
 WE CAME TO A SHARP BEND A MINI CAR    
 CAME ROUND.I CLOSED MY EYES AND HEARD 
 A CRASH.A PIECE OF FLYING GLASS HIT ME
 BUT I WAS NOT HURT.THE MINI HAD BECOME
 JAMMED BETWEEN OUR CAR AND THE        
 HEDGE.MY BROTHER WAS CRYING SO I TRIED
 TO COMFORT HIM.MY MUM REVERSED OUR CAR
 AWAY AND THE MINI FELL BACK ON TO THE 
 ROAD AND DROVE OFF WITHOUT EVEN AN    
 APOLOGY WHILST WE CONTINUED OUR       
 JOURNEY HOME EVEN MORE SLOWLY.YES,ON
