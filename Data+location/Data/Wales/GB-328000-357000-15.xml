		<content> I wake to find a drink of pure orange 
 on my table.  After washing I get     
 dressed into my Liverpool kit and     
 watch the television{(Recreation)}    
 while I have my breakfast.  When I    
 have finished breakfast I go out and  
 call for my friends and we go to play 
 football.  We play football until we  
 realise we have booked the squash     
 courts so we go home to get ready.    
 Four of us play until lunch.  After   
 lunch my dad takes my friends and I   
 swimming to Plas Madoc swimming baths.
 We have a great time.                 
                                       
 After tea my friends and I play on my 
 computer.  When they have gone home I 
 watch television.  My favourite       
 programmes are No. 73, Hunter, and    
 Murder She Wrote.  I then play on my  
 computer again until supper.  After a 
 hot drink and a biscuit I go to bed.  </content>
