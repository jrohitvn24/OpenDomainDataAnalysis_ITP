		<title>14Entertainment in Llangybi</title>
		<content> Llangybi produces its own             
 entertainment.Most summers there is a 
 Village day comprising of a fun       
 run,car treasure hunt, childrens      
 sports and social evening.In Autumn   
 the Pumpkin Clubs at the White Hart   
 and Greyhound pubs judge the largest  
 pumpkin and run a charity auction.On  
 5th November there is a village       
 bonfire and fireworks display with    
 refreshments.The church holds a       
 Christmas Fair and the Hunt a boxing  
 day meet.January is often enelivened  
 by th Youth Club panto and Brownie    
 concert.The closure ofthe school this 
 year means an end to the Nativity     
 plays and sports days and possibly,the
 annual pancake race.However,there are 
 still village Hall events to enjoy    
 such as French nights,jumblesales and 
 slide shows about old Llangybi when   
 life,it seems,was really exciting.    </content>
