		<title>11RESIDENTIAL HOMES</title>
		<content> The{Aweldeg Residential Home}was      
 opened in 1975, to accomodate elderly 
 people. The home can cater for 46     
 residents but has 42,(12 men and 30   
 women) at present. 22 part-time staff,
 supervised by the matron, run the     
 home. Most residents are from the area
 around Llandysul. The more able       
 residents, who so wish, are           
 transported to the local churches, on 
 Sunday, or to the Day Centre at       
 Newcastle Emlyn during the week. They 
 can also walk down to the village. The
 oldest resident this year is 102 years
 old. Doctors from the two local       
 surgeries attend to all the residents 
 at the home. Payment for staying at   
 the home comes either from the        
 residents own income or from the      
 government. Relatives and friends are 
 allowed to visit, and various organis-
 ations, such as the W.I.,donate gifts.</content>
