		<title>05MORE ABOUT OUR BIRDS</title>
		<content> Apart from coniferous woodlands of the
 Forestry Commission which follow the  
 Dulas Brook and its tributary and     
 which contain generally only          
 woodpigeons and goldcrests as nesting 
 birds, there are a number of mainly   
 small pieces of deciduous woodland    
 which are far richer for birds. This  
 part of mid-Wales is said to carry the
 greatest breeding density of birds    
 such as the buzzard, pied flycatcher  
 and woodwarbler to be found anywhere  
 in their range. The pied flycatcher is
 particularly interesting as it is a   
 small migratory bird which returns    
 from Africa each April to the very    
 woodland in which it was reared. They 
 are fond of nesting in boxes provided 
 for them. The redstart and the        
 sandmartin are migrant birds which    
 have only recently started to build up
 numbers after African drought years.  </content>
