		<content>                                       
 On Friday July 5th we had our swimming
 gala.The swimming pool is located     
 outside our D-Block so we cannot      
 include it in our survey count.Twelve 
 schools entered.It was in the         
 afternoon and ten pupils were entered 
 with two reserves.We all went down in 
 cars.We arrived at half past one but  
 the gala did not start until two      
 o'clock.There were a lot of good      
 swimmers there.The girls relay team   
 came second in the finals.Out of all  
 the schools our school came third.    
 We were all very pleased.The Lady     
 Mayoress presented us with the        
 medallions and the shield.
