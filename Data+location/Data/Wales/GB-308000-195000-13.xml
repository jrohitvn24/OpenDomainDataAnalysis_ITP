		<content> start school blows at nine fifteen and
 I go straight to the hall to help set 
 out the chairs for assembly. After    
 registration we have assembly usually 
 until ten a.m. We go back to class and
 have English until ten forty when it  
 is break time and we go out to play.  
 Break lasts for fifteen minutes when  
 we are brought in by the teacher on   
 duty. We continue with English for    
 another half hour and then change to  
 maths. At twelve fifteen the morning  
 session ends. When it is our classes  
 turn we go in for dinner. Some people 
 have a packed lunch which they bring  
 from home, some, who live near enough,
 go home for lunch. For school dinners 
 we normally have chips and other fast 
 foods. After food we go back out to   
 play until afternoon school starts at 
 one fifteen p.m.                      
                                       </content>
