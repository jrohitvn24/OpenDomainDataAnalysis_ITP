 Jackie Thomas has a{farm.}It is called
 Garnwen farm. He has about 320{sheep  
 and dips his sheep three times a year.
 The sheep have to be sheared in June. 
 He has extra help from boys that he   
 knows very well. After he shears the  
 sheep he washes the wool and sends it 
 to a farm in{Tondu.}The farm in Tondu 
 sends it to the{Wool Marketing Board. 
 In the Autumn Mr Thomas is going to   
 have cattle for beef. He buys all his 
 animals in{Cowbridge.}He rents out    
 some of his fields for people who have
 horses. Mr Thomas also has cats and   
 sheep dogs which are well trained. Mr 
 Thomas is afraid of{chemicals}because 
 they might harm the sheep and damage  
 the soil. He has no gas and his{water 
{comes from under the mountains.}He    
 does have mains electricity.
