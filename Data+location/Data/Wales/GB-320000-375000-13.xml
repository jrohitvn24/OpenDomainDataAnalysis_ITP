		<title>13TRADE IN BAGILT</title>
		<content> Since the opening of the dual         
 carriageway in 1968      trade in     
 Bagillt                               
 has diminished quite considerably.    
 Prior to the dual carriageway opening,
 the main coast traffic from Flint-    
 Mostyn had to go through the centre of
 the village.The dual carriageway cut  
 out approximately 80% of the village.A
 considerable number of shops have     
 closed.Only some of the local people  
 use the village shops.Most of the     
 population buy the bulk of their      
 shopping in Flint or Holywell-in the  
 larger supermarkets.Shopping at       
 Holywell street market on Thursday and
 Flint street market on Friday is      
 popular.The Coed Mawr Sunday market   
 between Greenfield/Mostyn is popular. 
 Fruit,vegetables,clothes,tools,       
 household items are sold.Many local   
 people walk to the Sunday market.     </content>
