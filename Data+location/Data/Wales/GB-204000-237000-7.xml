		<title>07Going to School.</title>
		<content> I like going to school very much,but  
 sometimes I don't when I have         
 forgotten to do my work.I am in the   
 top class now and next year I will go 
 to Fishguard Secondary.Some of my     
 friends will go to Preseli and one    
 will go to Cardigan Secondary.        
 Before Christmas we had to work hard  
 on tables and learning good spelling  
 and neatness and doing lots of        
 exercises from books.Now in the summer
 we go outside to study lots and write 
 about what we see and what older      
 people tell us.                       
 We have a good choir,orchestra with   
 recorders,violins,'cellos and some are
 learning the trumpet and trombone now.
 We go swimming once a week at         
 Fishguard.Girls do netball,some hockey
 and rounders,the boys do rugby,some   
 football and cricket.We have three    
 Houses,Curig,Ingli and Morfa.         </content>
