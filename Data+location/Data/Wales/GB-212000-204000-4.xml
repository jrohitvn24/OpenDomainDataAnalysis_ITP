		<content> boats used for fishing.There was not  
 much holiday trade before the 1939-45 
 war,only Sunday School trips and day  
 trippers.A little boatbuilding took   
 place.The walls of the harbour became 
 very worn and in 1958 Lord Merthyr    
 handed it over to the nation.The      
 Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries 
 set up the Saundersfoot Harbour       
 Commissioners.Since 1958 Â£600,000 has 
 been spent keeping the harbour in good
 repair.It is now used for pleasure and
 fishing boats.There are 184 moorings, 
 94 in the centre for boats 20-35ft.   
 long.Around the walls are running     
 moorings for boats up to 17ft.The cost
 of a mooring is between Â£35 and Â£70.  
 The harbour is now full of boats with 
 many people on the waiting list.{
