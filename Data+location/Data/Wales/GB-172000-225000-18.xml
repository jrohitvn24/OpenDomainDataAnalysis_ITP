		<title>18The Midland Bank St.Davids.</title>
		<content> The Midland Bank branch at St.Davids  
 employs five people .In the winter    
 they have about fifty customers a day 
 but during the summer the daily rate  
 rises to two hundred and fifty        
 customers a day.The Griffin savers    
 account has been a great success with 
 Midland Bank because it has caused    
 the children to open more and more    
 accounts with the Midland branches.   
 The bank has recently obtained a new  
 computer terminal which helps         
 with the bank's accounts.The computer 
 is the most important piece of        
 equipment in the bank as it stores    
 addresses, balances and rates of      
 interest.We asked the bank manager    
 Mr. David Howell if there had ever    
 been a robbery at the bank.He         
 said"There has never been a robbery   
  at this bank."
