		<content> Primary education is provided in the  
 village at Catbrook Primary School.   
 Built in l876, it has two classrooms  
 and a third room which is used as an  
 office, library, TV room and storage. 
 There are 37 children (22 junior and  
 l5 infant) and they are taught by a   
 headteacher and an infant teacher.    
 School meals are brought in daily and 
 served by the two kitchen assistants  
 who supervise the children at         
 lunchtime.  Children are also visited 
 by two peripatetic music teachers for 
 wind and stringed instruments.  They  
 take part in festivals and concerts.  
 This year the children have produced  
 an anthology of poetry and have been  
 presented with certificates from      
 Cadbury's and W.H. Smith in their     
 national competitions. The PTA is very
 active and hold fund-raising events   
 every term to provide extra equipment.</content>
