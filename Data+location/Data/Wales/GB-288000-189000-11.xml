		<title>11Pontycymers Industrial scars</title>
		<content>  The Coal Field industry in Pontycymer
 has affected the physical landscape of
 the area. The unsightly pithead gear  
 and colliery buildings cover 19.1     
 acres of the Pontycymmer area, though 
 the Glengarw workings have been       
 removed from the valley bottom by the 
 N.C.B.                                
  The waste tips resulting from the    
 colliery workings which lie around    
 Pontycymer are probably the most      
 unsightly as they do not blend with   
 the natural landscape, cause loss of  
 sunlight, create dust, and pollute    
 the river Garw-"the black river".     
  Other unfortunate consequences of the
 sub-surface workings are subsidence   
 and landsliding. Pontycymer is liable 
 to subsidence of up to four feet.     
  Residents hope it will not take as   
 long to remove the scars of industry  
 as it took to create them.            </content>
