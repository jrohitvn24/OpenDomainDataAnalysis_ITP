		<content> The area is excellent for tourism,    
 catering for many interests.          
 Historically it is very important and 
 has several buildings of great        
 interest. For the more energetic the  
 hilly areas are suitable for walking, 
 climbing, orienteering, pony-riding,  
 and for forces training. There are    
 several lakes, the largest of which,  
 Llyn Geirionydd, now 'dead' because of
 pollution, is used for sailing, wind  
 surfing, power boating, scuba diving, 
 and canoeing. There is a picnic area  
 and car parking facilities. Fishing is
 available in Glan Gors and on the     
 river Conwy on a fee paying basis. The
 Forestry Commission mounts exhibitions
 about their work and maintain and sign
 post walks through Gwydyr Forest.     
 There is accommodation in good hotels,
 boarding houses, bed &amp; breakfast, and 
 caravan and chalet sites.             </content>
