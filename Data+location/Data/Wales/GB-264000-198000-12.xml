		<title>12The D.V.L.C. (Contd.)</title>
		<content> at the D.V.L.C.. We know that there is
 tight security around the building    
 because a pass is needed to get in and
 out.                                  
     Before the D.V.L.C. was built the 
 land was part of Clase Farm. A famous 
 man, Oliver Cromwellonce stayed on the
 farm. Oliver Cromwell was Lord        
 Protector. He was more important than 
 the king. The army made him Lord      
 Protector of the commonwealth of      
 England, Scotland and Ireland.        
     There is a rumour that ghosts     
 inhabit the sixteenth floor of the    
 D.V.L.C.. Maybe the ghost is Oliver   
 Cromwell.The ghost story is that when 
 people lock up, the doors open and    
 papers fly out of the drawers and     
 about the room. Helen Mort's          
 grandmother(J1) used to clean the     
 sixteenth floor and she believed that 
 there were ghosts, so she retired.    </content>
