		<title>18GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> In our school we play many games on   
 the yard.My favourite game is Rounders
 and Netball.We play many other games  
 such as Bulldog,Stuck in the          
 mud,Postman's Knock,Tick,Please may I,
 Who's got the ball,Donkey,Tennis,     
 Football and Cricket.These are the    
 games we play outside.We play many    
 games inside aswell like Snakes and   
 Ladders,Chess,Draughts,Ludo and       
 Dominoes.This is how you play Bulldog.
 One person stands in the middle of the
 yard and all the other chilldren run  
 when the person shouts Bulldog.All the
 chilldren run to the other side of the
 yard trying not to be ticked .If they 
 are ticked they have to help the      
 person who shouts Bulldog to tick the 
 rest of the chilldren.This goes on    
 until there is only one person left   
 and that person is on.
