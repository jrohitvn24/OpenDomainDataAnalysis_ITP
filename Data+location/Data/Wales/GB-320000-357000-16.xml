		<title>16Nercwys &amp; Eryrys - History</title>
		<content>  There is some evidence of prehistoric
 remains in this area. The only        
 recorded cairn is on Nercwys Mountain.
 Two fields called Cae y Garreg - Field
 of the Stone - suggest there had been 
 standing stones. The name Gist Faen   
 means stone chest, there is no trace  
 of a stone now.                       
  In 1982 a Bronze Age axe with a gold 
 ingot hidden in the socket and 2 gold 
 bracelets were found on a ledge at    
 Craig y Wolf, near Eryrys. These are  
 now in the National Museum, Cardiff.  
  Two small Flint instruments were     
 found in the area in the 1970s        
  Eryrys was originally known as       
 Tre-yr-Yrys, later as Tre'r Yrys,     
 possibly from the name Gyrys - a      
 collector of welsh proverbs. Other    
 explanations of the name are the word 
 Eryr meaning eagle or Erw Rhys meaning
 Rhys's Acre.                          </content>
