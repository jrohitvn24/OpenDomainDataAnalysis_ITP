 If I am taken ill my mother calls for 
 the doctor.The doctor has his surgery 
 at Bethesda.There are three doctors   
 who look after the people of our area.
            If the doctor thinks I need
 some pills my father will go and get  
 them from the Chemist in the          
 village.If I need to go to the        
 hospital I then have to travel down to
 the Bangor,to YSBYTY GWYNEDD.This is a
 huge new hospital that was opened in  
 1984.The people from the whole of     
 Gwynedd attend this hospital if they  
 are very ill.                         
              The doctors surgery is   
 open every weekday but on Saturday and
 Sunday there is a doctor on calkl     
 ready to deal with emergencies only.
