		<title>09Farming Dairy</title>
		<content> Although farming is considered the    
 main industry in this area, it is not 
 undertaken on a large scale.  Most of 
 the farms are over coal measures and, 
 in most cases, coal has been worked   
 there as on the only dairy farm in the
 area.  This Farm, Wernddu Isaf, which 
 has 20 British Freisian cows produces 
 milk which is sold to the Milk        
 Marketing Board who, in turn sell it  
 to C.W.S. Ltd., Llangadog.  It is     
 collected by bulk road tanker daily   
 and taken to Llangadog for the        
 manufacture of butter or creamed rice 
 puddings.  The access to the farm is  
 not suitable for road tankers so a    
 mobile tank is brought to the         
 collection point daily.  There is an  
 additional enterprise, a riding       
 school.  The other exception is a     
 poultry farm (Llanllechau) where egg  
 production is the main enterprise.    </content>
