		<title>19Alyn Valley: Recreation</title>
		<content> The scenic countryside here attracts  
 nature-lovers and ramblers from places
 within easy travelling distance. One  
 of the best walks is 'The Leete', a   
 footpath along the River Alyn between 
 Loggerheads and Rhydymwyn. The Leete  
 was originally constructed in the 19th
 century as a channel to take water    
 from the river to power water-wheels  
 at lead-mines in the Alyn Gorge:now it
 provides an attractive woodland path  
 starting at Loggerheads on the river- 
 bank, and further down the valley     
 becoming a ledge cut into the steep   
 valley side. A spectacular spot on The
 Leete is 'Devil's Gorge', where a     
 narrow footbridge carries the path    
 over the rocky chasm of an old calcite
 mine. The rock-faces here are used by 
 climbers for abseiling, while the     
 caves and disused mines nearby provide
 interest for cavers.                  </content>
