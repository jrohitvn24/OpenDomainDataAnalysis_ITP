		<title>08RHYMNEY CHAPELS-RELIGION</title>
		<content> Religion has always been an integral  
 part of Welsh life,and if one walks   
 around the town of Rhymney today quite
 a lot of evidence to this effect will 
 be seen.Basically religion can be     
 divided into two main sections:Non-   
 Conformist and Catholic.The Catholic  
 Church embraces both Roman and        
 Church in Wales.                      
 Although today perhaps only 15%-20%   
 of the population regularly attend a  
 place of worship, there is still a    
 considerable religious influence in   
 the area.Services are conducted in    
 both English and Welsh, although it is
 true to suggest that sermons in Welsh 
 are understood only by                
 a small percentage of the population. 
 As in all Welsh communities chapel and
 church membership is dwindling and the
 financial burden, faced by such       
 establishments, increases yearly.     </content>
