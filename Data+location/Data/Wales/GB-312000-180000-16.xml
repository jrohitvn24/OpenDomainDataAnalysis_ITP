		<content> Children's Books.                     
 A lot of children in Radyr Primary    
 School read books for a hobby.Every   
 month we have a bookclub in school    
 when we can order books of our choice.
 They are paperbacks and cost about a  
 pound.A recent idea has been games    
 books which are very popular with     
 boys.A game book does not have a set  
 story like a normal book.It is divided
 into paragraphs which are numbered.   
 After each paragraph the reader is    
 given a choice of what he wants to    
 happen.The next paragraph you read    
 depends upon what you decide.The      
 reader therefore decides how the story
 progresses.The stories are always very
 exciting and usually involve fighting 
 monsters.Dice are used to decide the  
 outcome of the fights.If you lose a   
 fight you die and the story is        
 finished.                             </content>
