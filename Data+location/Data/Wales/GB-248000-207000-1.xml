		<content> The land covering this block is mainly
 farmland.It is a hilly area rising to 
 a height of 993 feet at the top of    
 Mynydd Sylen.                         
 It is a sparsely populated area with  
 farms dotted across it.Part of the    
 village of Ponthenry appears in the   
 north-west corner of this block.The   
 village of Cynheidre,which is very    
 small,is near the south border.A small
 part of the village of Pontyates also 
 appears in the west.                  
 Cynheidre Colliery and its surrounding
 coal tips take up one sixth of this   
 area.This is the biggest employer in  
 the area.                             
 Minor roads run through this area and 
 also a disused mineral railway.       
 The housing is mainly over a hundred  
 years old though some houses have been
 built recently.
