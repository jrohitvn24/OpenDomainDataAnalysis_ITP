		<title>15FARMING,CATTLE</title>
		<content> In order to reduce depemdence upon a  
 single animal reared for one purpose  
 only, there has been an attempt to    
 diversify the activities of CNEWR     
 ESTATES Ltd. (as the farm is now      
 known) into both cattle farming and   
 forestry.   Modern cattle rearing     
 dates from 1957 with the development  
 of a suckler herd. This started as a  
 herd of Hereford cows, but experiments
 in crossing with a Galloway bull were 
 successful in producing hardy animals 
 better suited to these exposed and wet
 hills.  From 1980 a herd of pure      
 Galloway cattle has lso been run on   
 the higher ground. The cattle calve in
 autumn before being housed for the    
 winter.  The intention is to increase 
 the size of the herds to about 500    
 head of cattle, about double the      
 present size.
