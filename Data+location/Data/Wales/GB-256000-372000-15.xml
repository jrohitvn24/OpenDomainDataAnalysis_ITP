		<content>    One of the main industries in the  
 area is tourism. Whilst Bangor itself 
 has not got what are known as tourist 
 attractions it still has many visitors
 during the summer months.             
    The university hostels are rented  
 out to visitors during the summer     
 months.                               
    The Menai Strait attracts many     
 yachtsmen and fishermen. There are    
 sailing clubs in the area and these   
 welcome visiting yachtsmen. During the
 first 2 weeks of August of each year  
 the Menai Strait regatta is held.     
    When restoration work is finished  
 it is hoped that the pier at Bangor,  
 which is 1500 feet long, will help    
 attract many more people.             
    Bangor is used as a base for       
 visiting Snowdon and the mountains of 
 the area which are some 10 miles away.
