		<title>09Education in Magor</title>
		<content>  The Community of Magor has two       
 Primary Schools. This year both       
 Schools have had building.Magor have  
 had a new extension and Undy are      
 having a new school built.The obvious 
 reasons for these developments are    
 because of the growing population in  
 this area.These two Schools are       
 slightly different from each othor in 
 the respect that Magor is a Church    
 school and Undy a council school.As it
 is a Church school the Church helped  
 pay the cost with additional help from
 the county council.                   
  I go to Magor V.A.P school.It is a   
 large school with about 220 children  
 in it with 7 teachers.We have many    
 subjects,such as Maths,English and    
 Environmental studies.The top class   
 have a computer to themselves.We have 
 three computers altogether.
