		<content> The Territorial Army Headquarters was 
 opened by Her Majesty the Queen,      
 accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh  
 on March 16th.1984.The building has a 
 canteen,a leisure room and a drill    
 hall where they  have map reading.    
 Here they clean and strip their       
 weapons blindfolded.If the cadets stay
 overnight they have to sleep in the   
 drill hall.The firing range is thirty 
 metres long and the target can be     
 altered to represent a man at 300     
 yards,200 yards and 100 yards.There   
 is a food store and a cadet is given  
 a box with dry rations,enough for     
 twenty four hours.The full time staff 
 are a captain,one sergeant major,one  
 colour sergeant,one clerk,a vehicle   
 mechanic and a caretaker.Thirty army  
 cadets meet on Wednesdays and Fridays 
 and the air cadets meet on Mondays and
 Thursdays.                            </content>
