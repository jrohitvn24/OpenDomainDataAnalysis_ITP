		<title>09Home Life in Eglwysbach</title>
		<content> I live on a farm. It has a slate roof 
 and the house is built of stone. The  
 house is about 450 years old and has  
 five rooms. It is about three miles   
 from the village and I get a lift to  
 school from our next door neighbour.  
 My hobby is riding a motor bike and   
 sometimes I go around the sheep with  
 it. In our family there are three of  
 us, dad, mam and I. We have three pet 
 dogs. I like playing football and when
 I go home from school I help my dad.  
 Then I do my homework. Sometimes I    
 stay with my friend in the village to 
 play instead of going home and then my
 mother comes to fetch me before it    
 gets dark.
