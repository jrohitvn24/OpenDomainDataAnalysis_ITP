		<content> In Bethlehem there is only one place  
 of worship and that is the Independont
 chapel called Bethlehem.Many things   
 take place in the chapel every year.  
 Each Sunday afternoon I go to         
 Sunday School with mmany of my        
 friends. We learn new songs,read from 
 the bible and draw pictures.During the
 autumn the children aged from 4-13    
 take part in a Harvest Thanksgiving   
 evening.In preporation for our        
 Chrismas play we practise during the  
 evening.We enjoy Chrismas time because
 we have a Sunday School party where we
 eat well and sing.We only speak Welsh 
 at Sunday School.Other things that we 
 do is we go on a summer trip, we also 
 take part in the "Eisteddfod" and a   
 religious exam.
