		<content> 1. In this high land water is in      
 abundance and with it, water dwelling 
 creatures: frogs, newts, fresh water  
 animals of all kinds. Much of the     
 water is an unpleasant brown in colour
 because it contains iron oxide -called
{vitrol}by local people- which washes  
 out of the old mine levels. It seems  
 to have relatively little effect on   
 the life in the water : I have seen   
 tadpoles hatching happily in thick    
 vitrol.                               
 2. Pasture: heavily grazed by sheep,  
 the pasture contains little of        
 interest except fungi, now and again. 
 The local people talk of a halucogenic
 mushroom growing in the area{Magic    
{Mushrooms}which is said to be used by 
 teenagers
