		<title>14HOBBIES-WAYNE'S GOAT HERD</title>
		<content>        Wayne Simmonds, a pupil at     
 Croesty Primary School, helps his     
 grandfather run a goat herd of ten    
 females and one male. They keep a herd
 of Saanen goats which can be          
 recognised by their short, white hair.
 The milk from the goats is sometimes  
 sold locally or made into cheese,     
 fruit yogurt or soft cottage cheese.  
 There is a lot of work involved in    
 looking after these animals but the   
 family enjoy this hobby.              
      The family also keep bees in     
 forty hives made by Wayne's           
 grandfather, who was a carpenter. Even
 when covered by protective clothing   
 the family have to be very careful    
 when dealing with the bees. Again the 
 honey produced is sold locally and is 
 enjoyed by many people in Pencoed.    
 Wayne enjoys these hobbies.
