		<title>13Local History, Gwyddelwern.</title>
		<content> Some time before{600 AD}a group of    
{Irish}immigrants left the stone       
 hill-top camp on Caer Druwyn, moved   
 into the valley and settled on the    
 marshy ground which was thenceforth   
 known as the swamp of the Irish       
{(Goddelwern) - Gwyddelwern. St Bueno  
 found them there and persuaded the    
 king of the district to give him land 
 on which to build the first church of 
 wattle and daub with a thatched roof. 
 Like him the Irish were Celtic        
 Christians. The first recorded Vicar  
 was appointed in 1535 and three years 
 later the first stone church was      
 built. Of the medieaval stained glass 
 which filled its windows only two     
 small fragments remain.               
 In the{Eighteenth Century,}the village
 itself had four houses and two        
 taverns, but the workers from nearby  
 estates filled the church on Sundays. </content>
