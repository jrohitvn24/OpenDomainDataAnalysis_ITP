		<content> IN HALTON THERE USED TO BE A BUSY     
 MINE, BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND ALL THE   
 MINERS HOUSES KNOCKED DOWN AND COUNCIL
 HOUSES BUILT IN THEIR PLACE. BUT NOW  
 COAL IS GOING TO BE MINED AGAIN. AT A 
 PLACE CALLED LEY FARM THERE IS A LOT  
 OF COAL CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AND IT IS
 TO BE OPEN CAST MINED. IT WILL TAKE   
 ABOUT 2 YEARS AND WILL MAKE ABOUT 20  
 MORE JOBS IN THE AREA WHICH IS        
 IMPORTANT AT PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE   
 HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. WHEN IT IS         
 FINISHED, THE COAL BOARD PROMISE TO   
 MAKE ALL THE FIELDS LOOK JUST THE SAME
 AS THEY DO NOW. THERE HAD TO BE AN    
 ENQUIRY BEFORE MINING WAS ALLOWED, BUT
 AS COAL IS SO PRECIOUS BECAUSE OF     
 NATURAL RESOURCES BEING SHORT, IT WAS 
 ALLOWED.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
