 researched by Sarah Probert           
    People did not go on holiday very  
 much then,and if they did it would    
 only be Barry or Porthcawl,some people
 would go out to Kent the country on   
 working holidays.They would stay in   
 the farmhouse,and go out picking the  
 farmers crops and at the end of the   
 day he would pay them.                
    We never went on holiday because   
 there were too many of us,my eight    
 brothers and sisters,my mother and    
 father and me.We would spend all our  
 money on food and clothing.My father  
 worked down the pit and brought home  
 around Â£2.00 a week which was         
 considered poor money.He didn't bath  
 in the pit he came home dirty  and    
 would bath
