{Interview with Mr. A. Jones, 86,      
{Soughton Villager,born June 1899-     
{reporter M. St-Amour.                 
   We talked to Mr Jones about his work
 in the Soughton co-operative shop.  Mr
 Jones came to Soughton School as an   
 infant, then to Northop School because
 Soughton didn't have room for Juniors 
 then.  He worked at the aged of 7 in  
 the Co-op after school hours.  There  
 were no working hours; he went home   
 when the Manager said he could go     
 home.  He had sixpence a week wages.  
 He left school when he was twelve.  He
 eventually became manager of the Co-op
 in Caernarvon.  He said Soughton has  
 made a change for the better. His     
 father worked in the mine for 15      
 shillings a week.  Mr Jones opened the
 new Co-op in Soughton but the shop has
 since closed down.                    </content>
