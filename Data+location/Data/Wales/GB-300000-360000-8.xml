		<content>    St.James'church is important for   
 its religious and social events. An   
 English service is held every Sunday  
 morning,and once a month this is a    
 family service. Occassionally a       
 bilingual service or all Welsh service
 will be held on St.James' or St.Davids
 Day.The Sunday School has recently    
 been re-introduced, all the mothers   
 take turns at teaching.               
    Confirmation classes are held for  
 teenagers and the Women's Guild meets 
 every month.                          
    All sections of the community are  
 represented at the church and members 
 come from a wide area,so social events
 are designed where people will get to 
 know each other.A Birthday Tea where  
 seating was arranged according to     
 month of birth,was a popular recent   
 event.Harvest supper and Easter tea   
 are other good occassions.            </content>
