		<content>    The shop provides a natural point  
 for the communication of{local events.
 Local activities are advertised in the
 shop window, including notices of {   
{shows, whist drives, fetes and        
{meetings.}As a result it often proves 
 to be an informal meeting place where 
 local activities are discussed.       
     The changes in the format of the  
 shop have been generally welcomed by  
 the community. There is now much more 
 space, goods are clearly displayed and
 service is generally quicker. A few of
 the older villagers have felt that    
 some of the personal contact and the  
 opportunity for conversation have been
 sacrficed in implementing greater     
 efficiency.                           
       Outside the Post Office is the  
 village's only {Post Box and Public   
{Telephone Kiosk.}
