		<title>07Limekilns and Enclosure.</title>
		<content> There are two disused limekilns in    
 this square.   This provides evidence 
 that this land is sited on limestone  
 rock.   The lime was taken to other   
 areas to be used for fertiliser.      
 This industry had an obvious influence
 on the area as a nearby wood is named 
 Limekiln Wood.                        
 Also in this area is an Iron Age land 
 enclosure.   This was later taken over
 by the Romans.   Attempts to gain     
 access to this were denied as barbed  
 wire had been put across the Public   
 Footpath.  Intusion into this area was
 obviously actively discouraged as     
 there was an abundance of prohibitive 
 notices.
