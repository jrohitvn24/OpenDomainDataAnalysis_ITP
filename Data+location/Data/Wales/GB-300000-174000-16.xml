		<title>16FARMING _ PASTORAL</title>
		<content> The main occupation for people in our 
 area is farming.The Vale is well      
 suited for pastoral activities and    
 this is shown in the high percentage  
 of dairy farms.Many farmers diversify 
 with beef cattle,fodder for the       
 animals and a cash crop.              
  A typical farm would keep a herd of  
 dairy cattle of around thirty with    
 fifteen beef cattle for winter        
 fattening.Fodder is usually grown in  
 the form of barley and grass and this 
 is supplemented with high protein     
 meal.Milk is generally taken once a   
 day after the early milking to the    
 Unigate dairy,thirteen miles away at  
 Porth.
