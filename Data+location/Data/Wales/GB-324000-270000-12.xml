  The Kennels of the Teme Valley Hunt  
 have been here for about twenty years.
 Fifty seven dogs are housed here.     
 English, Welsh and Fell Hounds are the
 breeds favoured. The puppies are      
 "walked" with local farmers. Run by   
 one family, the dogs hunt the Teme    
 Valley Hunt twice a week during the   
 Winter months.The hunt itself is over 
 one hundred and fifty years old.      
  The Long Distance Footpath _ Offa's  
 Dyke crosses south east corner of the 
 area. The country_side iis transversed
 by many footpaths. It is good walking 
 country with many fine veiws of both  
 the English and the Welsh             
 countryside.This part of the country  
 is well used by walkers.              
  An added attraction is the abundance 
 of wild flowers. Many birds nest in   
 the area including Buzzards.          </content>
