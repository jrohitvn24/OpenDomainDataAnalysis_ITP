  When speaking with parents the       
 children found that they had worn     
 similar fashions to their parents.    
 Nowadays young people have their own  
 fashions.There are quite a few to     
 choose from - Punk,Trendy,Heavy Metal,
 Mods and Skinheads.Punks are the most 
 outrageous in their dress and         
 hairstyle.This will include Mohican   
 hairstyle where all the hair is shaven
 off except for a spiked ridge of hair 
 down the middle of the head.They also 
 wear safety pins through their noses  
 and ears.Trendies have no particular  
 hairstyle but just wear the most      
 fashionable clothes.Heavy Metal       
 followers support pop groups like Iron
 Maiden and wear old jeans,tee-shirts  
 and keep their hair very long.Mods are
 similar to Trendies.Skinheads have    
 very short hair and wear BIG boots.   </content>
