		<title>20BUILTH'S FAMOUS STATUE</title>
		<content>{(CONTINUED)                           
  The statue is made mostly of concrete
 and has been sculpted by a local      
 artist named Bernard Jones. He has    
 had to come back a couple of times    
 to repair and clean up his statue.    
 I must admit,I don't like the         
 sculpture very much myself and I'm    
 sure a lot of people would agree with 
 me, but I still think it's a pity that
 people can take a hammer and chisel to
 it and cover it with paint.
