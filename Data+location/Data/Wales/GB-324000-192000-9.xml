		<title>09FAIRWATER SHOPS</title>
		<content> FAIRWATER SHOPS ARE ABOUT 1.5 KM FROM 
 CWMBRAN TOWN CENTRE.THEY SERVE HOUSING
 ESTATES ROUND THEM.THERE ARE 15       
 SHOPS.OUR CLASS DID A SURVEY ON MAY   
 24th OF THE CUSTOMERS.WE COUNTED      
 PEOPLE USING THEM AND INTERVIEWED     
 THEM.THE BUSIEST SHOPS WERE THE       
 NEWSAGENT THE SUPERMARKET AND         
 THE CHEMIST.LESS BUSY WERE THOSE      
 SELLING CHIPS,PET FOOD,HARDWARE AND   
 BREAD AND THE COUNCIL HOUSING OFFICE  
 AND LAUNDRETTE.THOSE WITH FEW         
 CUSTOMERS WERE THE BUTCHERS,OPTICIAN  
 GREENGROCER AND TWO HAIRDRESSERS.WE   
 THINK THESE FIVE SHOPS WERE LEAST BUSY
 BECAUSE CWMBRAN TOWN CENTRE IS SO     
 CLOSE.SHOPPERS TOLD US THEY DO WEEKLY 
 FOOD SHOPPING ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY  
 (PAY DAY).MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THE     
 SHOPS WERE EXPENSIVE AND THEY USED THE
 TOWN CENTRE AS WELL.
