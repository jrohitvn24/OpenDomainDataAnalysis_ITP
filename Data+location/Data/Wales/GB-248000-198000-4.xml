		<title>04Transport in Llanelli.</title>
		<content>  In an effort to attract more people  
 to Llanelli both for jobs and         
 shopping,the Borough Council are      
 continually improving the road system 
 through and around the town.The town  
 centre, in this block, has a one way  
 system which speeds the flow of       
 traffic and eases congestion          
 considerably.A new road has recently  
 been opened making access to the M4   
 Motorway much quicker and easier.A    
 continuation of this road to the town 
 ring road is under construction at    
 present. Llanelli is served by British
 Rail Western Region,and has a         
 modern refurbished Station. The Bus   
 Station is near the Town Centre and   
 has buses to all the surrounding      
 area,incuding Rapide Services.Only    
 small pleasure craft use the docks    
 now.The only working boat is a sand   
 boat which is berthed at a small wharf</content>
