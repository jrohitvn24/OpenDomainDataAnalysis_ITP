		<title>16PORTHMADOG TOURISM</title>
		<content> Porthmadog is situated on the west    
 coast of Wales,where there are many   
 beaches.It is a small,very well       
 planned country town with all the     
 streets leading on to the main street.
 In the winter it is fairly quiet but  
 because of the nearby{beaches},the    
{Festiniog Railway}and easy access to  
{Snowdonia}the population is multiplied
 five times from Easter to September.  
 Tourism is the main source of income  
 as there is hardly any other work     
 available.Many shops -craft &amp; gift    
 shops,cafes- cater solely for the     
 tourist trade.Several of these close  
 during the winter months,but open 7   
 days a week during the busy summer    
 season.There are a few hotels and many
 B&amp;B facilities available.A new Welsh  
 Tourist Office was opened in 1985     
 providing local information and       
 bed-booking facilities.               </content>
