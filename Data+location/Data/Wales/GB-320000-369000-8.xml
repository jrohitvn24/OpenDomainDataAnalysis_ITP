		<content> One thing young people are always     
 being criticised for is watching too  
 much television. Teachers and parents 
 often saw we should read more and     
 watch television less. Some older     
 people did not have television when   
 they were young, none of our class    
 could imagine what life would be like 
 without TV. This is the viewing habits
 of our group, averaged out from a     
 week's viewing.                       
      55% watched TV in the morning    
          before school                
     100% watched TV at some time every
          day                          
  The average length of time watching  
  each day was:                        
   Less than 1 hour: 17%               
        1 - 2 hours: 13%               
        2 - 3 hours: 25%               
        3 - 4 hours: 28%               
  More than 4 hours: 17%               </content>
