		<title>14GAMES THAT WE PLAY</title>
		<content> In our school we play many different  
 sports.We have teams that compete in  
 football and cricket,netball and      
 rounders,athletics and swimming.We    
 play against other schools.At playtime
 the girls play tennis and other ball  
 games.They also have two hopscotch    
 games painted on the yard and they    
 enjoy playing on those.We also have   
 circles painted on the yard where we  
 can make up our own games.The boys    
 enjoy playing British Bulldogs.In this
 game one person has to catch the other
 players.He can do this by chasing and 
 touching them.When they are touched   
 they must stand still.The game        
 continues until all the players are   
 caught.All the boys and girls enjoy   
 playing chain touch.If it is wet at   
 playtime we stay in our classrooms    
 such as chess,draughts,cards and      
 hangman.                    {Talycopa}</content>
