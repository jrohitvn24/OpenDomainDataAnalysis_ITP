 With all the mountains around us we   
 get a lot of visitors who come along  
 to climb them.Not many of the local   
 people take up mountaineering,maybe   
 because they are afraid they will fall
 off.We see the mountain rescue        
 helicopter from R.A.F Valley on       
 Anglesey nearly every weekend.They are
 helped by the OGWEN VALLEY MOUNTAIN   
 RESCUE TEAM.The team is made up of    
 volunteers who are interested in      
 climbing.Sir John Hunt and his men    
 used the TRYFAN and GLYDERAU mountains
 to train in before they conquered     
 Everest in 1953.A lot of aeroplanes   
 came down in the mountains during the 
 war years.The mountains are part of   
 the SNOWDONIA NATIONAL PARK .
