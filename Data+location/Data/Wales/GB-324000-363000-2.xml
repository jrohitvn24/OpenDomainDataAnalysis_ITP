		<content> The Buckley-Mynydd Isa conurbation    
 occupies hilly ground (500ft O.D.)    
 that separates the Alun Valley to the 
 south from the Dee estuary to the     
 north. From the medieval period until 
 the 20th Century man has been         
 attracted to the district because of  
 its resources. Coal measures were     
 worked extensively until the heavy    
 faulting of the area proved too       
 expensive to work during the 1930s.   
 Fire-resisting clays were also        
 exploited since early times, the      
 principal products being bricks.      
 Pottery and clay tobacco pipes were   
 also manufactured from the clays of   
 glacial deposits. In modern times     
 cheap housing has been the main       
 attraction of the area. The county    
 town of Mold is 2 miles away.
