		<content>   The community of Stackpole is       
 predominantly Church of Wales.Within  
 the parish boundaries are two churches
 but no chapels and there is only one  
 chapelgoer(Baptist)living in the area.
   The present rector has been         
 incumbent of the parish for a little  
 over two years.At first his ministry  
 was confined to the churches of       
 Stackpole and St.Petrox,but in January
 1985 it was extended to include       
 Bosherston and St.Twynnells when their
 rector retired.
