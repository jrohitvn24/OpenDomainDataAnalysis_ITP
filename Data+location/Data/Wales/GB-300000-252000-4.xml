		<content> Birds such as the dipper and grey     
 wagtail are always present along the  
 river although the former has         
 decreased due to acidification of the 
 Irfon and its tributaries. Most of the
 herons within a 20 mile radius of here
 come from the heronry at Cefndyrys.   
 The kingfisher is a resident on the   
 river but suffers badly in severe     
 winters when the river freezes as in  
 1981 because, unlike the dipper which 
 goes below the ice, the kingfisher is 
 then unable to dive. The goosander    
 first began to breed in Wales (at the 
 Elan Valley) only some 10-15 years ago
 and is now widespread and some say    
 reaching pest proportions. This       
 fish-eating duck is sometimes blamed  
 for the decline in fish numbers though
 this is unlikely for the fish decline 
 predated the increase in goosanders,  
 which usually nests in holes in trees.</content>
