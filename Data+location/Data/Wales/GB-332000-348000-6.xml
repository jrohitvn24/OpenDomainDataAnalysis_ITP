		<content> The recorded history of St. Giles     
 church dates back to 1220 when it was 
 closely associated with Valle Crucis  
 Abbey near Llangollen. The West Tower,
 one of the Seven Wonders of Wales, was
 completed in 1520, so for over four   
 centuries the tower of St. Giles      
 Church standing at 136ft, has been the
 main feature of the towns skyline.    
 During the Civil War, Paliamentary    
 forces entered the church, melted down
 the organ pipes to make bullets and   
 used the church building as a stable  
 and prison. Of special interest to    
 American visitors is the tomb in the  
 churchyard of Elihu Yale, benefactor  
 of Yale University U.S.A. A replica of
 St. Giles Church Tower forms part of  
 Yale University buildings. Also       
 associated with the church is Bishop  
 Heber, who wrote the famous missionary
 hymn " From Greenlands Icy Mountains".</content>
