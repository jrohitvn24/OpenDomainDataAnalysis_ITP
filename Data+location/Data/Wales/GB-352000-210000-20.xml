 We left the Church and walked down the
 old village street where we saw The   
 Elms, a private home for elderly      
 people. We passed a house called      
 Victoria Cottage which was built in   
 1719, also a house called{The Steps   
 which was built in the 17th           
 Century.Opposite was{new development. 
 Soon we reached the{Post Office}which 
 included an off licence, village shop 
 and cafe. The shop, off licence and   
 cafe opened from 8.30 to 21.00 hours. 
 The White Horse Inn is the last pub in
 England. Opposite in the local Garage

 and Â£2.02 for 2-star. The minimum
