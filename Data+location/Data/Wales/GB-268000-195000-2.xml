		<title>02THE ENTERPRISE ZONE</title>
		<content> The enterprise zone was designated on 
 11th June 1981 as Britain's first     
 enterprise zone.It consists of 735    
 acres and is run by Swansea City      
 Council.There are many benefits e.g.  
 exemption from rates on industrial and
 commercial property.The Swansea       
 enterprise park forms part of the     
 historic lower Swansea Industrial     
 Valley.In addition to the old         
 collieries such works as the Rose     
 Copper Works were located in what is  
 now the enterprise park.At the end of 
 the last war the decline of these     
 works left behind a derelict landscape
 of waste tips, obsolete plant and     
 buildings and redundant railway       
 tracks.The only sign left of this now 
 are the slag heaps to the south of the
 park, parts of the adjoining BSC      
 Landore works and the now closed BSC  
 Dyffryn works on the A 48.            </content>
