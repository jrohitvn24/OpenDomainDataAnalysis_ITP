		<content>  I live next to a{Hunting Tower}which}
 was built in 1827{.Mrs. Whitworth}owns
 it and she is  now ninety years of    
 age. In the I95O's someone stole the  
 lead off the roof and so now water    
 comes through and it has rotted all   
 the wooden floors.The Tower was       
{vandalized}and the windows were       
 smashed and plaster fell off the      
 walls.Mrs. Whitworth used to own all  
 the houses such as{Penybryn Hall}and  
 even the{Brick Works.   }             
     The house that i live in has      
 fifteen rooms,it's a big house and    
 there are two cellars.At the bottom of
 the garden are the dog kennels and to 
 the left of them there is a pheasant  
 breeding ground.My address is{Tower   
{Cottage ,GARTH,TREVOR, LLANGOLLEN.    
 My name is JAMES RIGBY and i am eleven
 years of age.I have a brother called  
 Marcus and he is nine years old.      </content>
