		<title>15SOCIAL CONCERNS IN PENARTH</title>
		<content>{Community concern}is evident in the   
 use of land inside the boundary wall  
 of now{demolished"Penarth House."In   
 its place is"Sea Roads,"a fine example
 of{1930's style}architecture,with its 
 flat roof and curved staircase.This   
 was used as a{hospital for servicemen 
 stationed in the town during WW2.In   
 the same grounds are a{Private Nursing
{Home,and Morel Court,a Methodist Home 
 for the Aged.This has private bed_    
 sitting rooms with a communal lounge  
 and dining{room.International House,  
 built in 1964,meets the needs of men  
 and women from overseas with differing
 customs and religions.There are 40    
 study bedrooms and central communal   
 facilities,administered by the church.
 It is now being sold due to lack of   
 funds.Proceeds will be used to help   
 overseas students in the form of      
 grants and chaplaincies.              </content>
