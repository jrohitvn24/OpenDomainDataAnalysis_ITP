		<content>   The White Rose Shopping Precinct    
 opened on the 6th September, 1984. It 
 was developed by Beacontree Estates   
 Ltd.,in association with Philips's    
 Pension Fund and the Land Authority of
 Wales. It cost Â£4,500,000 and was     
 named after the garage which was on   
 the site previously.                  
   24 shops are already open and 5 more
 should be occupied by the end of July.
 Two lifts carry people to the roof car
 park which has 335 spaces but no      
 further levels can be added.          
   There are two entrances from the    
 High Street and one from Church Street
 where the new public library is being 
 built. Marks &amp; Spencers, Boots and    
 Woolworths have all extended their    
 premises to gain access to it.        
   The 13 staff include the Manager,   
 his Secretary, 3 security guards,
