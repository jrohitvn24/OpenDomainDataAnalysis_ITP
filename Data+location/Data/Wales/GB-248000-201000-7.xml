		<content> Tragedy at Lliedi Baptism Service     
 fifth of September 1959.Hundreds of   
 people lining the baptismal pool of   
 the River Lliedi at Felinfoel on      
 Sunday morning saw the Rev.J.Glyndwr  
 Davies,minister of Adulam Chapel,     
 collapse  as  he was conducting the   
 service waist deep in the river. He   
 died shortly afterwards in a nearby   
 house.  Friends of the 51-year old    
 minister had tried to persuade him to 
 get another minister to help at that  
 Sunday's open_air service.Onlookers   
 saw Mr.Davies baptise five of the 10  
 young candidates,then collapse as TV  
 cameras filmed the scene. Four deacons
 of the chapel carried him unconscious 
 from the pool into a house nearby.    
 There he died before the arrival of a 
 doctor. A fortnight later it was the  
 250th Anniversary of Adulam Llanelli's
 oldest Nonconformist church.          </content>
