		<content>      It has been stated time and time 
 again about the steel industry in our 
 town and there is more information on 
 ontheir page. However, there are other
 industries in the town that are also  
 of great importance.Although they are 
 not exactly in the area they          
 contribute to its upkeep. Such        
 industries as BP Chemicals, BOC ( The 
 British Oxygen Company), Tourism.     
 There are innumerous small industries 
 that all help to try and stem the flow
 of unemployment.                      
      Many people feel that the local  
 council have been a bit slack in their
 approach to tourism. They have not    
 exploited the potential they have     
 along the coast. This inturn affects  
 our area as it could reduces rates.
