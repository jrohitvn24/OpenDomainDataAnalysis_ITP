		<content> The most major recent development in  
 the Llandudno Junction area has been  
 the completion of the Â£127 million    
 section of the{North Wales Expressway 
 from Llanddulas to Glan Conwy corner  
 as a part of the continuing new A55   
 project that will link the entire     
 North Wales coastline. The Welsh      
 Office is now pressing ahead with     
 plans for the{Conwy river tunnel}on   
 which preliminary work is to start    
 later this year(1985).A tunnel under  
 the estuary from Llandudno Junction to
 Conwy Morfa was decided upon after    
 numerous protests about a fourth      
 bridge across the estuary that would  
 literally dwarf the castle.           
   {Conwy Carnival}returns on this year
 and will be held on Bodlondeb fields  
 on July 13 '85 after poor weather kept
 crowds away one recent summer.
