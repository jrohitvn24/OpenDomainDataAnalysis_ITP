 "market gardening" although most

 not done this and has achieved great  
 success in keeping pedigree animals.  
 The farm is 250 acres and holds       
 Jerseys, Fresians,Herefords, Ayrshires
 and Charolais for breeding purposes.

 has 2 men and a part-timer working for
 him at about Â£150 a week. He also has 
 30 acres of corn and 220-230 animals.
