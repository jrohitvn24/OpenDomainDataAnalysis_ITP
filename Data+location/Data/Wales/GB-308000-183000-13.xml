		<title>13THE PENSIONER 1</title>
		<content> Pensioners in Gwaelod-y-Garth tend to 
 contribute more to the local community
 than the other inhabitants of the     
 village.                              
 Considering their age and general well
 being, they are amazingly active and  
 remain the group most likely to get   
 things done in the village.           
 Gwaelod-y-Garth itself is a small     
 village perched on the mountain above 
 Taffs Well. Most of the young people  
 who have recently moved into the      
 village own cars and find it easy to  
 travvel to the large shopping areas   
 such as Cardiff or Pontypridd.        
 The pensioners however are ill served 
 by the local public transport. The bus
 service is very infrequent and the    
 pensioners feel they are in great     
 danger of becoming prisoners in their 
 own homes.                            
                                       </content>
