		<title>18Changing Monmouth</title>
		<content>{Monmouth District Council}has prepared
 a{consultative document}which proposes
{changes}in the town of Monmouth.      
{Traffic}congestion is seen as a       
 problem although it is not intended to
{pedestrianize}all the town centre. The
 Monnow Bridge area though would, the  
 planners contend, benefit from such an
 arrangement.                          
  There is approx 1,350 parking spaces 
 in the town which should be added     
 to.New proposals include: commercial  
 use of the{old slaughter house arches,
 extend{Agincourt Square}street market,
 which is already an attractive area.  
  By far the biggest development       
 suggested thus far is to transform the
 old{'bus station}into a{shopping      
{precinct.}This would include a large  
 supermarket. The unit might have its  
 own parking and other amenities.
