		<content>   Children at{Bryn Stanley}were intri-
 -gued by recent{excavations}next to   
 their estate.A large notice proclaimed
 that work was being done for the{Welsh
{Water Authority}by{Norwest Holst.}Our 
 curiosity was satisfied during        
{Heulfre's}annual visit to camp school 
 at{Pentrellyncymer}to pursue our      
{environmental studies.}Whilst touring 
 the{Alwen Water works}to see the      
 cleaning process for our water we     
 learned of a{holding tank}being built 
 at{Denbigh}to be fed by{Alwen water.  
 Back home we visited the site to find 
 out more. The sunken tank is{built of 
{reinforced concrete}with a{capacity   
{for 2500 cubic metres of water}to back
 up{Denbigh's}supply. Apart from a     
 portion visible from higher ground    
 nothing will be seen as the area will 
 be{landscaped}with grass and trees to 
 blend with the{environment.           </content>
