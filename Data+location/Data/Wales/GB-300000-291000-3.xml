		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ALAN B.</title>
		<content> AT 6 O'CLOCK ONE MONDAY MORNING, MY   
 FATHER AND I DECIDED TO GO TO         
 WELSHPOOL LIVESTOCK MARKET. ONCE THE  
 LORRY HAD BEEN FILLED WITH DIESEL WE  
 JOURNEYED TO SEVERAL FARMS TO OBTAIN  
 LIVESTOCK FOR THE MARKET.             
   ONCE AT WELSHPOOL OUR ANIMALS WERE  
 UNLOADED AND THE LORRY WAS DRIVEN TO  
 THE PARKING GROUND TO BE CLEANED.     
   AFTER CLEANING WE SAT DOWN TO EAT   
 OUR SANDWICHES AND DRINK OUR COFFEE   
 WHICH MY MOTHER HAD PREPARED FOR US.  
   MY FATHER THEN SPOKE TO MR.JONES    
 AND MR.EVANS WHO ASKED US TO DELIVER  
 SOME ANIMALS FOR THEM.                
   WHEN WE HAD DELIVERED THE ANIMALS   
 THE LORRY HAD TO BE RETURNED TO GATE  
 FARM. ONCE HOME WE HAD A HOT MEAL WITH
 THE REST OF THE FAMILY AND I TOLD THEM
 ALL ABOUT MY DAY AT WELSHPOOL MARKET.
