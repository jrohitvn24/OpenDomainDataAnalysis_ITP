		<title>08COSHESTON AREA - SHOPS</title>
		<content>     There are only 2 shops within the 
 block. In Cosheston there is one      
 general store. There use to be a post 
 office but it now only opens twice a  
 week, for two hours each time, for    
 people to get their pensions, family  
 allowance and stamps.                 
     The new Council estate near       
 Buttermilk lane in Pembroke also has  
 just one shop. It is a general store, 
 too, and there are many families      
 living on this estate.                
     People in both places, and people 
 that live on farms, have to go to     
 Pembroke or Pembroke Dock for most    
 their shopping. They also have to get 
 their petrol there too, because there 
 are no garages in the area.           
     For some items, especially clothes
 and larger items, people even travel  
 to Swansea so that they can buy things
 cheaper &amp; have a greater choice.      </content>
