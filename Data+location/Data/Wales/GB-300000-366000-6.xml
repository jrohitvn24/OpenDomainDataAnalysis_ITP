		<title>06FARMING IN HENLLAN (2)</title>
		<content> The dairy herds average 45 in number, 
 mainly British Friesians.The quality  
 of the herds has been improved by     
 using the A.I. services from pedigree 
 bulls at the Milk Marketing Board     
 centre near Ruthin.Because of the     
 small local population the milk is    
 marketed at the COOP creamery at Llan-
 dyrnog where it is processed into     
 cheese.The method of collection has   
 changed in recent years from churn to 
 bulk tanker.                          
 Store and fat cattle are also reared. 
 The calves are usually Friesian cross 
 bred with Charolais and Limousin as   
 well as the traditional Herefords.    
 Store cattle are sold at markets in   
 Abergele and Ruthin whilst fat cattle 
 in the local Denbigh market.Some are  
 also slaughtered in the local abbatoir
 in Henllan.
