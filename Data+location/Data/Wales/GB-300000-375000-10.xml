		<title>10FAMILY LIFE-The Simpsons</title>
		<content> My family consists of my parents and  
 myself,we live in a 3 bedroomed       
 bungalow and mostly we use the lounge.
 The house has gas central heating with
 radiators in every room and it costs  
 about Â£350 a year to run.Electricity  
 plays an important part in our lives, 
 the electrical things in the kitchen  
 are a fridge, cooker, toaster, kettle,
 washing machine, spin dryer and radio.
 We also have clockradios, a hairdryer,
 a hoover, iron, a trainset and 2      
 televisions. Sometimes we go out for a
 meal or drink. We have a car and      
 hardly use public transport. Our      
 hobbies are swimming and cycling. My  
 dad spends like this, 40% of his pay  
 on household bills, 40% on food and   
 20% on car, holidays, pleasure and    
 savings. We have an average sized     
 garden, lawned at the front and a     
 vegetable patch at the side.          </content>
