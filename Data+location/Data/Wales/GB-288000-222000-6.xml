		<content> There is a useful account of the      
 history of farming in Crai Parish by  
 David Lewis published in BRYCHEINIOG  
 Vol IX,1963, which describes in some  
 detail the farming practices used     
 during the inter-war years and up to  
 the time of publication of that       
 article.                              
 The principal activity is livestock   
 rearing with much greater emphasis on 
 sheep than on cattle.  During the last
 two decades there has been an even    
 greater swing towards the production  
 of fat lambs for the meat market. This
 results in part from the existence of 
 E.E.C. sheepmeat subsidies and the    
 generally poor prices for wool to be  
 obtained from the Wool Marketing Board
 (which holds the monopoly to buy all  
 wool produced by British farmers).    
 Cattle are now only reared for beef.  
 There are no milking herds left.      </content>
