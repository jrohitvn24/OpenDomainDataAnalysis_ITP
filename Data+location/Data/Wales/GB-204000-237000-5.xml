		<content> I live in a bungalow in Maes Ingli,a  
 new Council estate of houses which    
 includes a block of Old People's      
 flats.Maes Morfa and Maes Curig in    
 Parrog Road are also groups of Council
 houses,but some people are now buying 
 their Council homes.                  
 The older houses are built of local   
 stone mined from Carn Ingli.Many      
 owners are now stripping off the      
 plastering and the very old cottages  
 in particular look really nice.I think
 all the houses should have stone      
 fronts.Most houses built today are    
 bungalows.Our Castle is now a private 
 dwelling.                             
 About one house in every three is only
 used in the summer when we see big    
 cars with surf-boards and boats       
 outside.I would like to live in one   
 but they are too expensive I think.I  
 am sad when I see them in winter.     </content>
