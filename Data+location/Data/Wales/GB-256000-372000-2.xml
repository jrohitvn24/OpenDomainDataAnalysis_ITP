		<title>02Employment in Bangor</title>
		<content>     Bangor is unusual in being a city 
 with very little industry.In the past 
 the slate quarries provided employment
 for many of the inhabitants.          
     The main source of employment     
 these days is education.The{University
{College of North Wales,}founded over  
 100 years ago, dominates Bangor both  
 physically and as an employer.Other   
 employers in this field are the{Normal
{College}and the{Technical College.    
     Another large employer is the new 
 district hospital,{Ysbyty Gwynedd.}It 
 opened about a year ago replacing the 
 old{Caernarfonshire and Anglesey      
{Hospital}in Upper Bangor.On the       
 outskirts of the city there is a small
 industrial estate which houses several
 small factories.                      
     This is, however , an area of high
 unemployment.
