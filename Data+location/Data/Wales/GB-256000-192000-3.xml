		<title>03DUNVANT VILLAGE</title>
		<content> From a thriving industrial village at 
 the turn of the century,the village   
 has become a solely residential area  
 since the closure of the last coal    
 mine in 1924.It was not until the     
 1950's and I960's that a rapid growth 
 in housing development took place.Many
 of the new residents had been moved to
 this area to form the nucleus of staff
 at newly opened factories,such as 3M's
 and Ford's.Many of the new residents  
 have taken a keen interest in local   
 activities and jealously guard what   
 remains of the rural aspect.This is   
 demonstrated by the current opposition
 to a proposed housing development on  
 what was farmland until 1984.One of   
 the fears is that the intervening     
 farmland between Dunvant and Three    
 Crosses will also disappear in        
 time,the area losing its individuality
 in an extension of Swansea's suburbia.</content>
