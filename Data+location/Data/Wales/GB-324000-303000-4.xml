		<content>   Leighton Farm Estate- continued     
                                       
     Mr. Naylor kept bison and         
 kangaroos in the park near the        
 Hall.Today unusual animals are still  
 kept in the area. We saw a new baby   
 llama at the Smithy. She was born on  
 the day of the Derby horse-race, and  
 named "Slip Anchor" after the winner. 
    In 1931 the local County Council   
 bought 500 acres of the farmland for  
 smallholdings, and the Estate was     
 split up. Many lodges and cottages in 
 this area were built by the Naylors in
 the 1850's.                           
{Employment}The Farm Estate buildings  
 are now rented out to local firms and 
 industries. These firms use the       
 buildings at present:- Litho Link     
 Printing, Kenton Jones Kitchens, Army 
 surplus, local farmers, car re-spray  
 and A.C. Roof Trusses.                </content>
