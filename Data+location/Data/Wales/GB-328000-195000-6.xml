		<content> After interviewing adults and children
 about what they like doing in their   
 spare time we had many different      
 answers.Two broad groups formed       
 physical exercise and hobbies.Some of 
 the hobbies were stamp collecting ,   
 reading,cooking,sewing,listening to or
 playing music.Some people did physical
 exercise like jogging,badminton,keep- 
 fit,swimming and many other sports.We 
 asked questions like "Do you watch    
 t.v. each evening?"Three hours was the
 average amount.Some people go to      
 concerts or live shows at the local   
 theatre others to adult classes at the
 local community centres.The sports    
 stadium is very popular and famous    
 because of its all-weather track.     
 Exhibitions are held at Llantarnam    
 Grange but in our survey we found that
 they are not well attended.In the     
 Cwmbran area  are 4 swimming-pools.   </content>
