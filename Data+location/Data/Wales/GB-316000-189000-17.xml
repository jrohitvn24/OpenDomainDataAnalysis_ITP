		<content>  The English Baptist Church comprises 
 24 members who meet at Maindee Road,  
 Cwmfelinfach.The age range of members 
 is from 40 to 70 years.We have no     
 minister and rely on preachers from   
 other Gwent Churches to lead Sunday   
 Evening Services.Junior Church is held
 on Sunday mornings and is lead by     
 church members.At this service        
 children of the Sunday school and     
 adult members join in worship.This is 
 a recent inovation and is proving very
 successful.Videos,film strips and     
 stories are used in these services.   
 Prayer meeting is held on Monday      
 evenings and also Bible Study.        
 Wednesday evening the Sisterhood meet 
 and on Thursday there is youth night  
 when between 30 and 50 local children 
 attend.We try to serve our community  
 in such a way to glorify God.
