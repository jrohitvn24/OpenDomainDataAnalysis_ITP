		<content> The ironworks is all but gone and much
 of the area has or is being cleared   
 and new housing being built.But people
 are trying to keep some of the old    
 buildings like the famous Dowlais     
 stables where the horses that worked  
 in the ironworks were kept.           
 The third part of our block is the    
 village of Pantscallog ("thistle      
 dingle").apart from some new housing  
 estates on its outskirts the village  
 has hardly changed.Its houses were    
 built mainly before 1900. with the    
 Caeracca Farm house marked 1776.      
 The village was once surrounded by    
 farms but many of these have now gone 
 Close by is Brecon Beacons  National  
 Park and a narrow gauge railway runs  
 from the village into the park.There  
 are also plans to build a motel in the
 area so making it a tourist area.     
 It is indeed a block of contrasts.    </content>
