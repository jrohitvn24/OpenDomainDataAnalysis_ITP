		<title>03LLANDYSUL CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Norman church in the village is   
 dedicated to St.Tysul(462-544) and    
 gives Llandysul its name = The Church 
 of Tysul.                             
 The ancient altar icorporated in the  
 present stone altar must be regarded  
 as an unique relic of Early           
 Christianity. The Velvor stone,       
 inscribed VELVOR FILIA BROHO in Roman 
 letters, is set in the wall and dates 
 back fourteen centuries. The tower is 
 of the Norman period, and shows four  
 periods of construction. The          
 battlements are an ornamental finish. 
 The four corners are gargoyles forming
 water spouts. The walled-up window in 
 the south wall is one of the oldest   
 pieces of stone eccclesiastical arch- 
 itecture in Wales. Figure-heads are   
 found on all the windows; the capitals
 of the northern doorway are formed of 
 the heads of a knight and a lady.     </content>
