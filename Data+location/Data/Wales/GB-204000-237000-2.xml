		<title>02The People of Newport</title>
		<content> We would like to record some          
 interesting facts that appeared from a
 questionaire we sent to all residents 
 in our area.                          
 25% are over 65 yrs.old,23% 16 yrs.or 
 under.                                
 30% of the people are retired.50% are 
 at school or in higher education.     
 16% of working population are         
 unemployed.                           
 Walking is the most popular leisure   
 activity,gardening,reading and        
 television also more popular.         
 Only 23% were born in Newport,39% were
 born elsewhere in Dyfed,but 38% were  
 born outside Dyfed and these gave the 
 reason for moving here as "Newport is 
 pleasant to live/retire in".          
 (Figures from a random sample of 500  
 questionaires returned.)
