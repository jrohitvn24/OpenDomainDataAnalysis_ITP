		<content> In our area studied,it was found that 
 most of the houses were either        
 semi-detached or bungalows.Along {    
{Maesdu Avenue}were the most expensive 
 houses,prices ranging from sixty up to
 one hundred thousand pounds.However,  
 as we moved towards {Llanrhos}the     
 prices dropped to around nineteen     
 thousnd pounds.Most of the houses were
 owner-occupied and lived in mainly by 
 elderly people.These elderly people   
 did not seem to come from the locality
 originally.                           
 Overlooking the golf couse there were 
 new developments,maisonettes known as 
 'Legoland'due to their unusual        
 construction.Next to these was a new  
 development under construction for the
 cheaper market by Wimpey Homes        
 Ltd.This is to become known as Traeth 
 Melyn.
