		<title>16Buildings Babell Chapel</title>
		<content>  Babell Chapel was built in 1827 and  
 became a memorial to Islwyn William   
 Thomas,a famous poet,who lived from   
 1832 to 1878.His poetry was written in
 Welsh,his most famous poem was called 
 "The Storm".Islwyn won four bardic    
 chairs in the National Eisteddfod. He 
 became linked to the chapel because he
 was the vicar.During the 1960's the   
 chapel was vandalised and broken into.
 The Presbiterian Church of Wales      
 bought the chapel for Â£10 and after   
 spending Â£4000 the chapel was         
 repainted and refurnished as a museum.
 It was opened by George Thomas,Speaker
 of the House of Commons.Now the chapel
 has a selection of paintings and      
 information about the locality,some on
 display in glass cases about the 1935 
 "Stay Down Strike",the railway line,  
 the sinking of the pit and Islwyn     
 himself.                              </content>
