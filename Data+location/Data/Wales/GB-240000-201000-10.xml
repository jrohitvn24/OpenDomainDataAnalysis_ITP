 carried out to find the type of       
 employment in our area. The sample we 
 took was of{fathers}of children in the
 junior section of Pembrey C.P. school.
{75% work outside the village          
{ 5% work in the village               
{20% are unemployed                    
 From our survey we found that some    
 fathers travel hundreds of miles to   
 find a job e.g. Saudi Arabia. Others  
 have jobs in Burry Port, Llanelli or  
 Swansea. Most travel to work by car,  
 others by motor-bike or vans and some 
 by bus. Jobs vary greatly.            
 These are some of the jobs:
