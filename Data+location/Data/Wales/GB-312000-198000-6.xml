		<title>06HOUSING TYPES - BARGOED AREA</title>
		<content> Over 50% houses in the Bargoed area   
 are of the older terraced type - and  
 of the semi-detached properties most  
 of these are of the same type as the  
 terraced homes already mentioned. Of  
 council owned properties there has    
 been much recent new building of flats
 and bungalows for OAP's. Also the     
 council have tried to upgrade the     
 standard of its properties, as far as 
 its budget has allowed. The sector    
 with the highest percentage of homes  
 lacking the two basic amenities (fixed
 bath/shower and inside W.C.) was that 
 of private rented accomodation, whilst
 council owned properties were the most
 likely to possess them. 99% of council
 owned homes possess the two basic     
 amenities, but only 69% of private    
 rented and 88% of owner occupied. The 
 substandard housing in the area can   
 only be remedied by Central Govt. aid.</content>
