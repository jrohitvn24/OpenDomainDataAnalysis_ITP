		<title>03THREE CROSSES</title>
		<content>   I live in{Three Crosses}where there 
 is an old primary school for infants  
 and juniors. In the village there is  
 an old chapel. Not a lot of people go 
 there. Mainly people go there a lot   
 when there is a funeral. When the kids
 in the primary school have a harvest  
 festival or a Christmas service they  
 are held in the old chapel. We usually
 start school at 3 or 4. I have now    
 finished in the Primary school and    
 have to catch a coach to{Bishopston   
{Comprehensive}which is 6 miles away.  
 In our village we have a hairdressers,
 2 shops and a Post Office. There are a
 few cattle grids around.              
   In{Bishopston school}we have to wear
 a school uniform. A blue skirt (for   
 girls), a blue or grey jumper, black  
 shoes, white or blue shirt, black     
 trousers (for boys) and a blue,yellow 
 and green tie.   YASMIN CHAUDHRY 2B   </content>
