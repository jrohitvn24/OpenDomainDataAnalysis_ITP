		<title>12TOURISM in RHAYADER</title>
		<content> Tourism generates a large amount of   
 employment particularly in the summer 
 months when many visitors arrive in   
 the town.Many people visit the area to
 see the Elan Valley resevoirs which   
 were built by Birmingham Corporation  
 at the end of the 19th century.This   
 tourism helped to offset the decline  
 in local industry.The rise of the     
 tourist industry led to Rhayader be-  
 coming a "resort"with shops being open
 on Sundays and Bank Holidays. Since   
 1970's there have been more foreign   
 tourists in evidence.The other main   
 attraction is pony-trekking with many 
 people staying in the town for trek-  
 king holidays.There is also a caravan 
 and camping site situated on the banks
 of the River Wye which attracts many  
 visitors.Fishing, canoeeing and,more  
 recently,hang-gliding are the other   
 main attractions.                     </content>
