		<content>{The Smith Farm                        
 This is a typical farm in this part of
 Gwent.  Mr. and Mrs. Smith have lived 
 on this farm at the top of Penyrhoel  
 for fifteen years.  The farm was      
 established in 18O6.  It is a         
 thirty-one acre stock rearing farm.   
 It is family run, two sons helping    
 with the work.                        
 Mr. Smith's day begins at 5.45a.m.,   
 when he gets up and has breakfast.    
 His first job at 6.3Oa.m. is to move  
 the electric fence to allow the cattle
 to graze.  He has seventeen cows,     
 eight of them are rearing calves.  He 
 has two pedigree Hereford bulls and   
 one four day old Hereford bull calf.  
 Each of the eight feeding cows have   
 one or two calves.  Mr. Smith then    
 feeds the pigs, collect the eggs and  
 feed all the other animals.
