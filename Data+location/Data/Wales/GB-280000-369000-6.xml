		<title>06Farming in Eglwysbach</title>
		<content> I live on a farm which is over 300    
 years old and it is called Plas Llan. 
 We have 92 acres of land, half of     
 which is flat and the other half on   
 steep slopes with quite a lot of      
 woodland. We have over three hundred  
 sheep which we keep for lambing. We   
 buy young cows in the autumn and sell 
 them in the spring after they have    
 been fed on silage throughout the     
 winter. My father has two tractors,   
 a van and a car. During the winter    
 months we have to feed the animals    
 twice a day and my brother and I help 
 my father when we can. My mother also 
 helps on the farm.A friend helps with 
 silage cutting. The lambing time is   
 a very busy time for us. Long ago many
 important people used to stay on our  
 farm because we live near the centre  
 of the village. Our school is built on
 land which once belonged to our farm. </content>
