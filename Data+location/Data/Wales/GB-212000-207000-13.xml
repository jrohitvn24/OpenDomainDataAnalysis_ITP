		<title>13Life in Stepaside Village.</title>
		<content> Kaye Howells lives in Stepaside and   
 she is 9.  She has many books and     
 she reads every night.  She plays with
 Hazel and Melanie James games like    
 rounders or on their bicycles.  She   
 plays 3 instruments, the recorder,    
 the violin and the piano.  She has    
 lessons every Monday on the piano with
 Mrs. Lewis.  She lives near the school
 and sometimes walks or goes by car.   
 She swims in a beach called Wiseman's 
 Bridge.  She writes, "The dinner      
 ladies are Mrs. Morgan and Mrs. Gill. 
 Some children in our school have      
 school dinners but I bring sandwiches 
 to school."  Kaye knows Mrs. Dennis a 
 housewife in the village.  In the     
 morning she makes the beds, washes up 
 dishes and hoovers the rooms.  She    
 likes quiz programmes, travel         
 programmes and situation comedy on    
 T.V. She reads the Western Mail.      </content>
