		<title>11BETTING SHOPS</title>
		<content> This shop is open from 11.00am to     
 5.30pm,after the last race.Bets can be
 put on horses,dogs,Eurovision Song    
 Contest or Miss World.                
    The takings are between Â£150-Â£200  
 each day.About Â£750 on a Saturday.    
    The Miners Strike cut the takings  
 by about 50%.                         
    Each day one lady manages the shop 
 but on Saturday it takes two.         
     Every betting slip has to pass    
 through a camera which has a          
 timer.Anything taken after a race has 
 started is void.All the sums have to  
 be accurate.There is a speaker for the
 results.                              
   Last saturday the takings were Â£742 
 but the shop had to pay out Â£701.68.It
 was not a good day!
