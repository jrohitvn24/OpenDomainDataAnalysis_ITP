		<content>   My name is Patrick and I am 14. I   
 live in a village called{Murton,}it is
 very boring. Near us is a forest and  
 if you walk through it you get to a   
 beach called{Caswell.}Sometimes when  
 the weather is right I go surfing. I  
 go to{Bishopston Comprehensive School 
 and I am taking 8 'O'-levels.         
   I have one sister, a cat and a dog  
 called Beth. The crazes at this moment
 are computers, surfing and            
 unemployment caused by{Maggie Thatcher
 (Prime Minister). Thje main areas of  
 unemployment are in factories.        
 Transport is very good except for the 
 buses and trains. Aeroplanes and cars 
 are very reliable 99% of the time. Law
 and order is held very well in our    
 country.
