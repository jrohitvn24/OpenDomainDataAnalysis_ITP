		<content> All the major denominations are repre-
 sented in the area,with non-conformism
 very strong. Some have active congre- 
 gations of all ages and of a wide     
 social spectrum. Others have smaller  
 numbers dominated by the elderly.     
 Various united services take place in 
 the year organised by the United Sun- 
 day Schools of Risca and Crosskeys,   
 with annual marches through the vil-  
 lages. Most of the buildings are over 
 70 years old, some being local land-  
 marks e.g.Moriah Chapel.The Crosskeys 
 Pentecostal building is now greatly   
 enlarged.The Machen area has a smaller
 number and range of institutions than 
 Risca, several chapels having been    
 closed and converted or demolished.   
 The Anglican church has the strongest 
 fellowship in Machen,though Ebenezer  
 Chapel presents a bright front with   
 its new black and white repainting.   </content>
