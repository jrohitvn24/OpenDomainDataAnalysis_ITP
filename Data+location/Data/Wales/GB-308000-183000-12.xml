		<title>12THE SINGLE PARENT</title>
		<content> At one time , being a single parent in
 a small village was very difficult.   
 People had such funny attitudes to    
 divorce.                              
 Although old fashioned ideas tend to  
 linger in villages, I do not find any 
 major problems around here. Perhaps it
 is because we are so close to Cardiff 
 that people have a much more liberal  
 outlook.                              
 I find that people are genuinely      
 helpful and concerned.                
 Having a young child, I am unable to  
 work until she goes to school so life 
 is not easy. There is not much money  
 to spare. I am grateful for my        
 neighbours. If I am not well, they    
 will do all they can to help and they 
 often care for Julie for me to have a 
 break.
