		<content> Our school{Ysgol Gymraeg Tyderwen}was 
 founded in{1948.}It was the third     
{Welsh}medium school in Wales the first
 being in{Aberystwyth}and second in    
{Llanelli.}It was the first of its kind
 in{Glamorgan.}A father of a present   
 school pupil, and one of the present  
 teachers were members of the very     
 first class. They are Royston Thomas  
 and Mrs.Jones. There were 5 children  
 present on the first day but the      
 numbers grew substantially during the 
 first year. Now the number of children
 in this school has grown to 226.Out of
 the 226 children only 39 have a parent
 who speaks Welsh.Children travel from 
 many parts of Maesteg to attend the   
 school, namely{Cwmfelin, Llangynwyd,  
{Garth, Nantyffyllon}and{Caerau.}The   
 furthest pupil Mathew Bevan lives in  
{Coetre Hen.}
