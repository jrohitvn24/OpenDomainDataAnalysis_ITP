		<content>Abergavenny lies on an important route 
into Wales from England and the title  
"Gateway of Wales" is well justified.  
There is much rich farming land and    
Abergavenny grew to become the main    
market town in the area.Athriving      
sheep and cattle market takes place    
on Tuesdays and Fridays.Regular        
horse and pony sales occur on          
Saturdays.A produce and general market 
occupies the Town Hall with many more  
stalls set up on Market Days outside.  
Every July the Abergavenny and Border  
Counties Show is held and this has     
become one of the largest agricultural 
shows staged in Wales.In September a   
Ploughing Match,Horse Show,Gymkhana    
and Sheepdog Trials take place in      
nearby Pandy.
