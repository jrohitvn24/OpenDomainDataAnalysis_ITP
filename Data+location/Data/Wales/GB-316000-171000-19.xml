		<content> The police in Penarth are concerned   
 about the way hooligans are causing   
 damage and trouble at the new Leisure 
 Centre in Cogan. The police have asked
 anyone witnessing anything like this  
 to contact them immediately. The      
 people in the area are very angry     
 about the way this small group of     
 youths is spoiling the enjoyment of   
 others. People living in Dinas Powis  
 are calling for a ban on heavy lorries
 using the village. There are fears    
 that a serious accident could be      
 caused because of the number and speed
 of the lorries.                       
 Plans to charge for entry to the      
 National Museums in Cardiff and       
 Penarth are not popular. We feel that 
 this would stop many young people     
 viewing part of their history,        
 especially the children of those on   
 low incomes.                          </content>
