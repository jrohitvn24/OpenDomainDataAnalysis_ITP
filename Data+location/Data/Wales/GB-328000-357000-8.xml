		<content> This era heralded the establishment of
 the brewing{industry}as a prosperous  
 benefit to the area.  After the       
 construction of a brewery in          
 Caergwrle's Derby Road, pubs such as  
 the Derby Arms, Castle Inn, Crown Inn,
 Bridge Inn and Halfway Inn sprang up  
 in Caergwrle and the Red Lion and     
 White Lion in Hope.                   
                                       
 In 1801, the first British census was 
 undertaken.  This revealed that in the
 Lordship (Parish) of Hope there were  
 1924 inhabitants.  By the end of the  
 century, the{population}had soared to 
 over 3000.  This was primarily the    
 result of the Industrial Revolution   
 and typified the general trend of     
 population rise throughout the        
 country.  {(Local history)}
