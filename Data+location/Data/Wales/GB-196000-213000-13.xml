		<title>13Local Customs in Uzmaston</title>
		<content>  In June the Mayor of Haverfordwest,  
 who is Admiral of the Port, together  
 with members of the Council, come down
 the river in two boats to Whitestone  
 Rock near Goodwood. This marks the    
 boundary on the Western Cleddau and   
 the ceremony is called Beating the    
 Bounds.    On Christmas Eve a midnight
 service is held at Uzmaston Church.   
 Holy Eucharist is celebrated and the  
 service is fully choral. The church is
 beautifully decorated with flowers,   
 holly, mistletoe and a lighted tree.  
 The Deanery Sunday School Festival is 
 held on Trinity Sunday, at one church 
 in the Deanery.  A special preacher   
 catechizes the children and the host  
 church provides them with tea before  
 Evensong.      The annual choir outing
 this year was to Caldy Island, where  
 Uzmaston Choir sang. Each Easter there
 is a sponsored walk for Church funds. </content>
