		<content>     Sadly our area is not an area full
 of department stores, so most         
 fashionable clothes have to be        
 obtained from outside our area. The   
 majority of the shops are small with  
 only the basic styles. Despite this   
 mods and punks go to other areas to   
 get their clothes. In Colwyn Bay there
 is an annual mod rally were mods have 
 a get together.                       
     Our area is very mountainous and  
 therefore there are no large venues   
 where well known bands can come and   
 perform.Even the theatres in the area 
 are small and are unable to hold a    
 large concert.The majority of people  
 enjoy a rural lifestyles.So there is  
 not much call for pop concerts anyway.
