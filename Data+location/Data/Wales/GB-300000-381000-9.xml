		<content>  The Little Theatre in Vale Road has a
 Children's Theatre Club and they      
 perform an annual pantomime and summer
 musical. 2 amateur dramatic groups,   
 the Liberty Players and the Little    
 Theatre group, each perform 3 plays a 
 year.                                 
  The Coliseum and Gaiety Theatres on  
 the Promenade are owned by the Council
 and have not enough seats to be able  
 to pay wellknown artistes. In summer  
 they have wrestling and family variety
 shows. The Council promised a new     
 theatre would be built in the second  
 stage of the Sun Centre but it has not
 yet been built.                       
  In the summer there is a daily Punch 
 and Judy show near the clock tower.   
 The Astra has 2 cinemas in one        
 building and the Plaza Cinema is now a
 bingo hall and social club with       
 snooker and pool rooms.               </content>
