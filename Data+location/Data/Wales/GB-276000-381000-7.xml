		<content> During May 1985,{150 people were      
{interviewed at random on Mostyn       
{Street,}the main street of the town.  
 It was found that 52% lived locally   
 and the remainder were either visiting
 the town or on holiday.  Of the second
 category, 85% came by car, while the  
 remaining 15% used public transport.  
 48% said they were in Mostyn street to
 shop.   Other reasons given were:     
 business, work, holiday.    Asked what
 they bought, over 90% of the shoppers 
 said: food, clothes or both.  The most
 popular single shop named was Marks   
 and Spencer (by 60%).   Second came   
 Asda Stores (by 20% of shoppers).  No 
 other single shop was named by a large
 enough number of shoppers to be of    
 significance.
