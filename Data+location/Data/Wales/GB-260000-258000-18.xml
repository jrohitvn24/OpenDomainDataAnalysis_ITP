		<content>    There are many social activities   
 in Llangeitho. In the village hall,   
 the following clubs meet every week:  
 the Men's Institute, the Women's Rural
 Institute , and the Aelwyd (the Welsh 
 language youth movement). There are   
 social evenings with the church and   
 chapel. The Ysgol Feithrin (the Welsh 
 medium playschool group) meets        
 occasionally in the Llangeitho        
 School and the Merched y Wawyr (the   
 Women of the Dawn) meets in the hall  
 at Llwynpiod, a mile from Llangeitho. 
 There is a Three Horse Shoes Darts    
 Team organised through meetings in the
 village pub. There is much to do in   
 Llangeitho, most of it carried out    
 entirely using the welsh language. The
 village life of Llangeitho is closely 
 knit and happy, just like a large     
 family, everyone knows everyone and   
 everyone helps everyone.              </content>
