		<content>  The majority of the farms are mixed  
 farms with almost no one farm         
 specialising completely in one kind of
 activity.Some farms concentrate on    
 arable farming, some of them          
 concentrate on livestock,but everyone 
 of the farms diversifies.There is one 
 large pig farm producing pigs for     
 bacon.Three farms were surveyed to    
 provide most of the information.The   
 land slopes steeply from the West,    
 downhill to the flatter land in the   
 East, which is only 6 metres above sea
 level.Farms and fields are smaller on 
 the higher ground than on the lower   
 ground. Smaller farms are about 11    
 acres in size and may have up to 18   
 fields each.The soil is acidic here   
 but the land is flat and easy to      
 farm.Animals kept on the farm include 
 Fresians and Ayreshire cows,a         
 Hererford bull.                       </content>
