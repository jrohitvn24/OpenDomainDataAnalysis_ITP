 sheep and store cattle.There are also 
 a few dairy farms.The average farm is 
 a hundred acres or more.In the summer 
 hay is harvested although silage is   
 becoming more popular,especially "big 
 bale"silage.                          
    Farmers take their stock to the    
 local livestock mart in Landovery,held
 in the shadow of the castle ruins,as  
 well as those of neighbouring towns.  
    There is a sale of fat lambs every 
 fortnight and also breeding ewes in   
 the Autumn. There is a monthly cattle 
 market and annual horse sale.         
        The average price of store

 income by offering holiday            
 accomodation.
