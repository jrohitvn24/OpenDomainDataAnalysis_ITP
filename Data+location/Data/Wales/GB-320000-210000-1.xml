		<title>01MOORLAND LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Most of the land in our blocks is     
 moorland.However,its cheif            
 characteristic is a deep gorge        
 separates the two main communities :  
 the one to the north being Clydach and
 to the south Llanelly Hill.The area is
 well known for its old ironworkings   
 and there are many tramroads near to  
 our school.The ironworks are now not  
 used but were important at the end of 
 the 18th century and early in the 19th
 century.There is also a disused       
 railway that once travelled from      
 Abergavenny to Merthyr Tydfil.        
    We have an important beechwood near
 our school with some ancient trees in 
 it,a waterworks which pumps water from
 the river in the gorge to Brynmawr,a  
 sewage works,and the Heads of the     
 Valleys Trunk Roads.                  
    It is a family sparsely populated  
 area.                                 </content>
