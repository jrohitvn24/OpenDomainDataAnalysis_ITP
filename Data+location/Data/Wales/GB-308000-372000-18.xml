		<content> Dear Friends,                         
            People tell ypu that moving
 house is one of the most traumatic    
 experiences anyone can have, and      
 they're right.Having gone through the 
 experience yet again i can say without
 any doubt that it is a tiring and     
 wearing thing.To see all one's        
 treasures packed away in boxes and    
 one's furniture manhandled up and down
 stairs andin and out of vans is       
 somewhat unnerving but it also makes  
 one realise how much baggage we now   
 think necessary for civilised living  
 to go on. When I was involved in      
 settling some Vietnamese families in  
 homes in Flint we were struck by how  
 little they had in materizl           
 possessions.Two suitcases and the     
 inevitable radio-cassette per family  
 seemed pitifully small....Part of the
