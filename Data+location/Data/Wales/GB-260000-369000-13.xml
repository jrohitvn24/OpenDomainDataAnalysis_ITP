		<title>13Tal_y_Bont Village</title>
		<content>       Many of the houses in the estate
 were for sale. People are moving out  
 of Tal_y_Bont for several reasons.    
       Recently there has been a lot of
 construction work,e.g. on the new     
 by_pass which passes the city of      
 Bangor. The hospital in Penrhos       
 Garnedd which serves the whole of     
 Gwynedd  was completed in 1984.       
           The Hydro Electric          
 Power Station near Llanberis, which   
 is now completed, was officially      
 opened by HRH Prince Charles in 1984. 
       The people are now leaving the  
 area for places like Scotland looking 
 for work.
