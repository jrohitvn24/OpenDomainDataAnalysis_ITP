		<title>01Tourists In St Davids</title>
		<content> Many tourists come to St Davids,      
 mainly to see the Cathedral and to see
 the coastal views. Also old people    
 come here to get fresh air and to see 
 the countryside. There are many places
 to stay in St Davids. There is the    
 Grove Hotel, The Old Cross &amp; St Nons. 
 Also there are many guest houses.     
 Other accomodation like caravan and   
 tent parks are available. Also there  
 are self_catering cottages. Many      
 people drive here or come by coach.   
 Many tourists come back to St Davids  
 year after year. Why is this? Maybe it
 is because of the wonderful sights. It
 might be the food and accomodation. It
 might the Welsh community. Lots of    
 people stay here for a week. The      
 majority of people who come by coach  
 only stay for the day but some        
 coach parties stay for the week.
