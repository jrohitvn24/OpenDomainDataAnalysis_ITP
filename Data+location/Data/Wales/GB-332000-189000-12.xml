		<content> significant historic remains are      
 Roman. The largest amphitheatre in    
 Britian was excavated in 1924 by Sir  
 Mortimer Wheeler, and the foundation  
 of the fortress barracks stand close  
 by. 1985 was a significant year for   
 Caerleon, because it saw the opening  
 of the Roman fortress baths after 10  
 years of painstaking archaelogical    
 excavation.                           
 Caerleon now is a thriving expanding  
 township which retains a unique       
 atmosphere and sense of history. It is
 a very popular residential area nd    
 most of its expansion is in housing   
 development. There is litte industry  
 in the area and most people travel to 
 surround larger towns to work. It has 
 good sporting and education facilities
 some thriving clubs and a community   
 centre.                               
                                       </content>
