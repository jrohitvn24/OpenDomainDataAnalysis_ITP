		<content>  Rhosgoch has recently gained more    
 importance as a centre because in 1953
 the area school was built there. This 
 served the area of Llandeilo Graban,  
 Painscastle and Newchurch where       
 formerly there had been schools but   
 are now closed. Rhosgoch is a hamlet  
 built on the edge of the Red Bog, now 
 an area of importance to the Nature   
 Conservationists, by the B4594 road   
 and under Pentre Hill in a valley. It 
 is a beautiful, quiet place where a   
 visitor wrote she 'saw a cuckoo in a  
 larks nest'. New houses have been     
 built in the last 15 years, mainly    
 inhabited by newcomers to the area and
 retired people. In 1983 a golf club   
 was built which hopes to provide      
 entertainment for local people as well
 as golfers and this helps to foster a 
 strong local spirit.
