		<title>16Travelling to School</title>
		<content> The school in{Caerau}serves a wide    
 catchment area so there are children  
 who must either catch a bus or walk a 
 long distance. Children living in     
 other parts of the valley who attend  
 the{Welsh School}are provided with    
 transport, either a bus or taxi. For  
 those children who have to rely on    
 public transport changes in the       
 timetable lead to confusion. Mothers  
 who have children in both Caerau      
 Nursery and Blaen Llynfi Infants      
 face the added problem as there is a  
 considerable distance between the two 
 buildings, some children are lucky    
 enough to be conveyed to school by    
 car, this can create congestion       
 outside the school especially on wet  
 days. In Summer some ride bicycles to 
 school but there are no facilities for
 keeping them safely.
