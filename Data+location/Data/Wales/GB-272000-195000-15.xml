		<content> A large part of our area is covered by
 reeds,marsh and saltings.Through this 
 area flows the River Neath.There are  
 many pills and small streams.Because  
 the river is tidal this area is often 
 swamped with water.When the tide is   
 out cows and horses are grazed on this
 land.There are several tracks and     
 small roads crossing the land.The     
 marsh is bordered by a railway line.  
 Another area is mainly taken up with  
 industry.This includes the Metal Box  
 factory,the Galvanised Steel works and
 the old site of the Eaglesbush        
 foundry.                              
 The rest of the area is made up of    
 housing,shops and some play areas.The 
 houses are mainly terraced with many  
 flats for senior citizens being       
 developed.
