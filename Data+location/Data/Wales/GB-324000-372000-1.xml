		<title>01Introduction to Deeside</title>
		<content> The 12 Km. block is located on the    
{North Easterly}border between{England 
{and Wales.}The landscape takes in the 
 town of Flint, Clwyd, and the Dee     
 estuary. The{Estuary}was once a busy  
 shipping route and Flint became one of
 a number of towns along this          
 industrial belt known as Deeside. Due 
 to the shifting sands and silting,    
 only the occasional small boat is seen
 on the Estuary today. The{town}with   
 its highrise flats and Edwardian      
 castle is a busy, friendly community  
 with a population of{12 300.}Many     
 people in the town were employed at { 
 the local{Courtauld's Rayon}works and 
{Shotton Steel}works, but due to the   
 recent closure of both these large    
 plants, the town has suffered badly,  
 18% of the working population are now 
 unemployed.{Enterprise Zones}are being
  created to attract small factories.  </content>
