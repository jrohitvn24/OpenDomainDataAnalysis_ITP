		<content> DAY IN THE LIFE OF MRS JENNIFER LLOYD 
 The alarm clock woke me at 7 a.m.,    
 Tuesday 20th May 1985. I woke my son  
 David, washed dressed and prepared    
 breakfast. I put the washing into     
 piles - whites, coloureds and towels. 
 At 8 a.m. my daughter Emma comes down 
 for breakfast and David leaves for    
 school. I put coal on the fire to heat
 the water for washing. After Emma     
 leaves for school I put the vacuum    
 cleaner over the carpets and hang out 
 the washing. My husband Clayton and I 
 have coffee, then go shopping to      
 Asda's Supermarket. On returning I    
 prepare Toad-in-the-hole, a batter    
 pudding with sausages which we'll eat 
 with potatoes, cauliflower and        
 carrots. After spending the evening at
 the sports centre, doing gymnastics   
 with Emma, I feed the dog and go to   
 bed. Tomorrow is another day.         </content>
