		<content> There are 4 rain gauges installed in  
 or near the area.Some of these only   
 operated for a few years after 1964   
 during the period when the use of this
 valley as a potential reservoir site  
 was being investigated.               
 LLWYN LLYDAN, further up the Senni    
 valley,at 351 metres,appears to have a
 total annual rainfall of about 2280   
 mm.GARN WEN, at 256 metres is somewhat
 drier at 1962 mm. At FOREST LODGE, at 
 350 metres, below the steep slope of  
 Fan Frynych,the annual total is about 
 1880 mm.                              
 The rainfall falls off rapidly towards
 the north so that BAILEA, in the      
 northern part of this area, the total 
 is only 1483 mm. All of these sites   
 show that the westtest month is usual-
 ly November or December; the driest   
 month is either  May or June.
