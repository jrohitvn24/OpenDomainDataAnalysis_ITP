		<title>11The Bedwellty Show.</title>
		<content>      The main annual event to take    
 place in the Blackwood area, is the   
 Bedwellty Agricultural Show. It is    
 held on Blackwood Showfield every year
 during August. It is usually opened by
 the Mayor of Islwyn and is always very
 successful.                           
      Last year, there were many       
 competitions for horses, cows, sheep  
 and pigs. The winners were paraded    
 around the ring by their owners. There
 were also sheep dog trials where the  
 dogs had to round up the sheep and see
 them safely into a pen.               
     At the Bedwellty show there are   
 usually lots of stalls which sell     
 sweets, cakes, hot dogs and drinks.   
 There is a brass band that parades    
 around the field playing music, and   
 sometimes they have an aeroplane      
 display and sky divers.
