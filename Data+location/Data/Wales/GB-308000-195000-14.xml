		<title>14THE SCHOOL TIMETABLE</title>
		<content> After registration we sometimes have  
 P.E. or sewing or other lessons of the
 timetable. This takes to afternoon    
 break which lasts ten minutes. We     
 continue our lessons until three forty
 five when the whistle blows to end the
 school day. Again the buses are       
 available to take us home but I walk  
 home and that takes ten to fifteen    
 minutes. When I arrive home I wait    
 until my mother arrives from work     
 which is usually at four forty five   
 p.m. I have my tea, then if it is not 
 raining I go out and call for my      
 friend Melanie Chamberlain and we play
 together until it is time to go home  
 at about seven thirty p.m. I watch    
 television then until ten thirty when 
 I go to bed.
