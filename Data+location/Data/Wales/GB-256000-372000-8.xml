		<title>08The Situation of Bangor</title>
		<content> Bangor lies in and on the westerly    
 side of a valley which runs from south
 west to north east. The{River Adda    
 flows through it, but is now guided in
 culverts under the city. The main     
 shopping area now covers the floor of 
 the valley whilst on the western ridge
 are found the main university         
 buildings, the small shopping area of 
 Upper Bangor and private houses. The  
 north eastern ridge is very rocky and 
 known locally as{Bangor Mountain.     
       Because the ground where the    
 valley meets the sea is so low the    
 high tides rise the water table at the
 lower end of the valley, the          
 Engineering building of the university
 is built where this soft ground meets 
 firmer earth and has pumps in the     
 basement to keep the foundations      
 stable. Several other buildings in    
 this area have special foundations.   </content>
