		<title>09A TYPICAL DAY-JONATHAN OWEN</title>
		<content> To start my day would be to wake up at
 ten  past seven and turn on the       
 television and watch Popeye.After that
 I would get out of my bed, get dressed
 and wake mum and dad up.I live in a   
 post office and my dad wakes up at    
 half past seven to let the post men   
 in.I have one brother,he is called    
 Mark,my name is Jonathan.After getting
 mum and dad up I would get my         
 breakfast which varies from cereal    
 toast to porridge or an apple.After   
 that I would get my football gear     
 ready and my crisps,then stick my bag 
 just outside our door and then play   
 with our visitors baby for half an    
 hour.When our taxi comes it beeps its 
 horn.Our taxi is Jason and Kevin's mum
 because they come to our school too.It
 is a white Cortina and is fast.When we
 get to school it is about five to     
 nine, our school opens at nine o'clock</content>
