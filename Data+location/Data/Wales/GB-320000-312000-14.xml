		<content> duck pond,surrounded by trees and     
 shrubs.                               
      Mr.Trevor seems rather unsure    
 about what the future may hold for the
 farming industry.He feels rather      
 restricted by the arbitary decisions  
 reached by governments and the common 
 market,which are often made without   
 consideration for the special needs   
 of many rural areas.It is very        
 difficult to envisage what the market 
 requirements will be in 10 years time.
  Nevertheless,whichever way market    
 trends alter in the future,Mr.Trevor  
 feels he will be able to cope with the
 alterations necessary.The nature of   
 his farm will allow him to change     
 direction (in farming terms) without  
 too many problems.
