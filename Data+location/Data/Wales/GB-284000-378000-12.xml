		<title>12RHOS BREAKWATER</title>
		<content> The{Breakwater}was designed to stop   
 Rhos flooding.It is made mainly of    
{sandstone}with some{granite.}The      
 majority of the stone comes from      
 quarries in the Ruthin and Denbigh    
 area,though some is from the Penmaen  
 Quarry on Anglesey.The contractors    
 hoped to build the breakwater in 13   
 weeks but it took nearly a year to    
 complete at a cost of{Â£996 000.       
 There has not been any flooding in    
 Rhos since the completion of the      
 breakwater,though it has yet to prove 
 itself against a combination of a     
{spring tide}and storms from the{N.E.  
   The breakwater now provides a       
 sheltered{harbour}for a number of     
 small leisure craft and so has added  
 to the facilities available for       
 holiday-makers.The vast majority of   
 people questioned approved of both the
 effect and look of the breakwater.    </content>
