 the Home. Regular visitors to the home
 is the hairdresser, chiropodist,      
 mobile library etc.  The residents are
 made to feel part of the community and
 are regularly entertained by schools  
 and societies.                        
                                       
 There are various Private Homes       
 catering for the elderly in Abergele  
 eg Bryn Aber, Tan y Bryn (physically  
 handicapped) etc.  There is a         
 predominance of retired and elderly   
 people living in Abergele and this is 
 an upward trend.  There are more and  
 more applications for converting large
 properties into Homes for the elderly.</content>
