       British bulldogs is a game where
 somebody is on and everybody else has 
 to run from one end of the yard to the
 other end of the yard without being   
 caught.Any number of children can     
 play.If you are caught you are on with
 the person that caught you.The game   
 carries on until the last person is   
 caught.When the last person has been  
 caught the game starts again.The first
 person caught is catcher in the next  
 game.
