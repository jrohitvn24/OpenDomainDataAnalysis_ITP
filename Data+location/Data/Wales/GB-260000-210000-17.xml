		<title>17COAL IN THE AMMANFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  Ammanford stands on the northwestern 
 edge of the South Wales coalfield. The
 seams are very folded and broken but  
 the high quality of the anthracite    
 coal has always made it in demand.    
  It was the coal that attracted many  
 poeple into the area 200 years ago.   
 The little village was then called    
 "Cross Inn". People moved to Cross Inn
 to find work in the many mines, like  
 the Butchers mine at Betws and the    
 Gelly Ceidrim at Glanaman. Railway    
 lines were built to carry the coal    
 from the Amman and neighbouring       
 valleys to the port of Llanelli.      
  Most of the old mines have now       
 closed. One large drift mine operates 
 at Betws and there are several open   
 cast sites, (eg. at Saron), but most  
 of the jobs in the coal mines have    
 disappeared in the last 40 years.
