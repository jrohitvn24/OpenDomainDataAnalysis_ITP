		<content> Cornist Hall was once the residence of
 the Sumners family who founded and    
 owned the steel works at Shotton on   
 Deeside, five or six miles away from  
 Flint.                                
                                       
 Today the Hall has been turned into   
 the local Golf Club's club-house, and 
 part of it is used for wedding        
 receptions and similar functions. It  
 was used as a restaurant for a short  
 time but failed to make money. The    
 grounds of the Hall form the nine hole
 golf course and park.                 
                                       
 Many men from Flint once worked at the
 steel works, today most have been made
 redundant. It seems slightly ironic   
 that they should spend their time     
 playing golf on the land of the man   
 who was once their employer.
