		<content> There are some more things which      
 interest me, like the people who put  
 cockerals in the cock-pits. Inside the
 cock-pit there was a circle, in which 
 people put cocks to fight to death. A 
 swallow had nested in the roof of the 
 cockpit and was making quite a noise. 
 The two classes also went to the      
 tannery, the coopery, and just before 
 they were leaving, they saw a place   
 which showed different kinds of       
 vehicles, that were used in the olden 
 days, such as the Ox-lain cart, the   
 gipsy caravan and other vehicles. I'm 
 glad I'm a pupil in Class 3.
