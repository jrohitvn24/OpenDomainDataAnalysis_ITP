		<content> initially using cars we attempted to  
 briefly cover the whole region in     
 three hours.We stopped when we saw    
 habitats which invited further        
 investigation.                        
    The date was 9 June.We began at    
 8 a.m. and spotted until 11 a.m. We   
 then walked through the Gaer Fawr     
 woods (a good site for ornithology)   
 until 12.30 p.m. The weather was      
 unseasonable with frequent showers.We 
 didn't record as many species as      
 expected,and the wood in particular   
 was disappointing.                    
    The list of recorded species was as
 follows: Buzzard,Pheasant,Curlew,     
 Woodpigeon,C.Dove,Cuckoo,G.S.         
 Woodpecker,Skylark,Swallow,H.Martin,  
 T.Pipit,Wren,Robin,Blackbird,S.Thrush,
 Whitethroat,Garden Warbler,Blackcap,  
 Chiffchaff,Willow Warbler,Goldcrest,  
 S.Flycatcher,Blue Tit,Great Tit,      </content>
