 area. Although predominately an       
 agricultural area there was a         
 large{factory}making central heating  
 radiators now unfortunately closed    
 with many job losses.                 
   There is one fairly large employer  
 manufacturing{cardboard for packaging.
   A light{industrial site}has been    
 developed at{Wonastow Road.}These

 software, farm equipment, civil       
 engineering contractors, tyre fitters,
 egg packaging and distribution, motor 
 factors, precision engineering,       
 builders'merchant, grocery provisions
