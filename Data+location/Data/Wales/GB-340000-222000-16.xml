 games the children of Grosmont play in
 1985.They are the games played by     
 children from 7_11 years of age.

 buildings it makes a good place to    
 play around.                          
    {Aimi says her favourite place to

 is a lovely view,it is quiet and I    
 play with Rex and Scotty the farm     
 dogs.Sometimes I throw a ball and Rex 
 gets it.It is a really lovely place to
 look at birds and play.
