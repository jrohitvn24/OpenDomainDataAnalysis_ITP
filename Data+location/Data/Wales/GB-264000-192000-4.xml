 The place where I live is Waun Wen. It
 has many houses and a big hill, but   
 not enough shops, post boxes or phone 
 booths. There are also not enough     
 youth clubs or parks. There is not    
 even a disco. There is a boxing club  
 and judo but sometimes it gets a bit  
 boring because there is nowhere to go.
 I would like to see more amenities for
 young people eg. a roller rink or ice 
 rink, a park and a youth club where we
 could play snooker or badminton. There
 is plenty of space available but      
 no-one seems to be interested in doing
 anything about it. There are two big  
 disused quarries where people dump    
 their rubbish. These could be cleaned 
 up and used for the amenities we need.
