		<content>    There has also been a great        
 increase in glue sniffing between 15  
 and 16 year olds in Carmarthen.       
    The two constables were then asked 
 what was the most important thing for 
 the police in 1985 in Carmarthen.     
    One of the most important things   
 was that they have started a better   
 liaison programme between schools.    
    The idea behind this is that the   
 policemen will get to know the        
 individual schools better so that the 
 police will not seem remote to the    
 children.                             
    They also said that in 1985 there  
 had been a shortage of manpower.This  
 was partly due to the miners' strike, 
 when many policemen had to go to the  
 coal mining areas.The shortage was    
 also due to the local authority cuts.
