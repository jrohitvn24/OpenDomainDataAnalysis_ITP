		<content> The first record of a Beast Market was
 in 1320.  The growing importance of   
 this market meant the development of  
 associated industries and activities. 
 The smithy, tailor, carpenter,        
 shoemaker, the brewer, fisherman,     
 ironmonger, etc. etc. Merchants from  
 as far as Liverpool and Chester would 
 attend the markets and ships from     
 Bristol, Plymouth and Ireland would   
 anchor in Abergele Bay. In the early  
 19th century 'Wells' and 'Bathing'    
 became popular and with the advent of 
 the railway Abergele became a tourist 
 centre.  The arrival of the first     
 motor car was 30th May 1903 from      
 Manchester and by 1914 there was a    
 regular service bringing in           
 holidaymakers from Chester, Liverpool 
 etc.  To cater for this boom the new  
 A55 expressway has been built,        
 by-passing Abergele.                  </content>
