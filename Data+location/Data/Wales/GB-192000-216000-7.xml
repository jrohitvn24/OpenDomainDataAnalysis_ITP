		<content>    This is a rural area and the main  
 transport is{privately owned motor-   
{cars}and{public services,}travelling  
 along well surfaced tarmac-ed roads.  
    There are two{A}category roads __  
 the{A 40}runs from South to North to  
 Fishguard &amp; the{A 487}runs from the   
 South-east to St.David's, situated at 
 the 'coastal tip' of South-west Wales.
    The only{B}road __{B 4329,}runs    
 South-east to North-east to Cardigan. 
    Roads are well sign-posted with    
 large modern sign-posts on the main   
 roads showing reference numbers and   
 mileage; on the side roads and lanes  
 are clearly seen finger-posts. We went
 and visited an old{mile-stone}on the  
 Fishguard Rd. showing miles and yards.
    Some Nationalists daub signs green;
 or paint on the{'Welsh' place-names.} 
    A small{civil air-field}is in the  
 North-east corner of our project area.</content>
