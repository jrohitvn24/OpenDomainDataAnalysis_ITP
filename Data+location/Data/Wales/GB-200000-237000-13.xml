		<title>13The Blacksmith at Dinas</title>
		<content> My name is Eifion;my dad is a         
 Blacksmith.You may think that the     
 trade has changed a lot but it has    
 only changed a little.The blacksmith's
 trade is very,very old and goes back  
 to Norman times when William the      
 Conqueror reigned.In those times      
 blacksmiths shoed horses and made     
 tools but did not make gates.This is  
 what my dad does.He welds gates and   
 takes then to Swansea for             
 galvanizing;repairs balers, P.T.O.    
 shafts for Tractors,and turbo hay     
 mowers.He also sharpens carpenters'   
 tools and makes doors for outside     
 sheds and dismantles machinery.       
   My father could shoe horses if there
 was a need -but there are not so many 
 horses in the area now .The           
 blacksmith's work has not really      
 changed- only developed with the      
 changing times                        </content>
