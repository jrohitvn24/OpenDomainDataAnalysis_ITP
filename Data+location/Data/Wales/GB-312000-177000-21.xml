<title>21Rookwood Sound</title>
<content>

Rookwood Hospital is also the home of Rookwood Sound which started broadcasting in October 1987. The late Julian Brinkworth, our founder member was the first on air. The studio's, located within the hospital grounds were open by BBC Radio 2's Ken Bruce after over Â£30.000 of fund raising, including chartering Concorde! In 2002 Rookwood Sound began broadcasting 24 hours a day using modern automation technology. Until this point when programmes weren't being produced locally service was sustained by BBC Radio 2. Shortly after the launch of Rookwood Sound in Rookwood the station was asked to extend its service to Llandough Hospital. To this day Rookwood Sound continues to broadcast to both hospitals. However due to changes Rookwood Hospital is soon to close with the remainder of its patients moving to Llandough Hospital. To this end Rookwood Sound has recently relocated one of it's two studio's to Llandough. Even though in the future Rookwood Hospital will cease to be Rookwood Sound will carry on.   &lt;br />
