		<title>10BUILDINGS in RHAYADER</title>
		<content> Housing in the Rhayader area falls    
 into 3 main categories:privately owned
 and occupied,privately owned and let, 
 and council owned.There are no blocks 
 of flats only 2 small buildings mainly
 for the use of senior citizens. A pro-
 portion of the original council houses
 are now owner occupied.               
 The oldest buildings were built around
 the crossroads in the late 16th and   
 17th centuries.The Castle Hotel used  
 to be a 16th century coaching inn.The 
 Old Swan,a former inn and now a       
 tourist office,was built in 1683 and  
 the Corner Shop was built in 1694.The 
 Workhouse built outside the town in   
 19th century later became The Royal   
 Cambrian School for the Deaf and is   
 now holiday flats and restaurant.The  
 Town Clock,the War Memorial,stands at 
 the crossroads,proving an obstacle to 
 the flow of modern day traffic.       </content>
