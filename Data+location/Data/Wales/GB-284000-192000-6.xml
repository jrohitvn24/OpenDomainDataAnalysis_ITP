		<title>06Employment in Caerau</title>
		<content> My father is a toolsetter he works in 
 the{Silent Channel.}In work he is     
 involved with heavy machines. He gets 
 paid weekly on a Thursday. He mostly  
 gets paid{Â£70 or Â£80}which is a good  
 wage because many people are          
{unemployed.}The amount of work and    
 jobs in Caerau is not as high as in   
 other areas. Many people work in      
 Maesteg, but some people even go      
 further to work, such as{Bridgend}and 
{Port Talbot.}My fathers work is in    
 Garth on the outskirts of Maesteg. Men
 and women work there. There are many  
 other jobs and it depends on the      
 amount of effort put into it the job  
 for the payment. There is very little 
 work in Caerau and many of the people 
 in the Llynfi  valley are unemployed.
