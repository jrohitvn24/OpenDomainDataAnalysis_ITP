		<content> MY VALLEY IS RECOVERING THE GREEN     
 LANDSCAPE IT HAD BEFORE COAL WAS      
 DISCOVERED OVER A CENTURY AGO.CONIFERS
 HAVE REPLACED MUCH OF THE ORIGINAL    
 VEGETATION(DECIDUOUS TREES,FERNS AND  
 GRASSLAND).COAL TIPS HAVE BEEN REMOVED
 AND LANDSCAPED SO MUCH OF THE MINING  
 SCARS ARE NOW DISAPPEARING.           
 THE STEEP SIDES OF THE VALLEY AND THE 
 NEED TO BUILD HOUSES QUICKLY AND      
 CHEAPLY LED TO THE BUILDING OF HOUSES 
 IN TERRACES ALONG THE SIDES OF THE    
 VALLEY.(LINEAR OR RIBBON-PATTERN).THE 
 HOUSES WERE BUILT OF LOCAL PENNANT    
 SANDSTONE,WITH SLATE ROOFS.THE LATTER 
 ARE NOW BEING REPLACED WITH COLOURED  
 TILES AND HOUSES MODERNISED.          
 THE VALLEY WIDENS AT TREORCHY WHERE   
 THERE IS A SETTLEMENT OF 7,632        
 PEOPLE.THE MAIN SHOPPING AREA AND     
 OTHER FACILITIES ARE CONCENTRATED IN  
 THIS AREA.                            </content>
