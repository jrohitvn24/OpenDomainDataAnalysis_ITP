 is a part of the Fishguard Road       
 between Prendergast and Tangier.On the
 side of the road is Withybush General 
 Hospital, Withybush Airfield, a Rugby 
 Club, houses, shops and a Post Office;
 also the Electricity Board has a depot
 here.                                 
           {** Pelcomb **              
{   }When we went to  Pelcomb  we went 
 up on the St.Davids Road and came back
 on the Haven Road.                    
     On the way we saw a few scattered 
 farms with land round them. Just after
 the  Pelcomb Bridge  was the Rising   
 Sun which is a  Public House. This has
 a large caravan site behind it.       
     By  Pelcomb Green  we turned off  
 into the village of Pelcomb, through a
 very narrow lane, and past the Church.
