		<content>      OUR NEW SCHOOL                   
Our new school will be called          
Pentrepoeth County Primary School.As   
you can imagine,if two schools join    
together it is going to take up a big  
area.We are in a very old school now   
andwe will be looking forward to it    
because it will have many more         
facilities.There will be a large hall  
which will be nice because ours at     
Bassaleg was burnt down.The school will
be big enough for 35O junior and infant
pupils.There will be hard play yards   
and grass areas for us to play games   
and sports.We haven't got a field now  
so that will be fun.The foreman on the 
building site says it is due to be     
finished in July 1986,but they are     
hoping to finish 3 months earlier.We   
will probably move in September 1986.
