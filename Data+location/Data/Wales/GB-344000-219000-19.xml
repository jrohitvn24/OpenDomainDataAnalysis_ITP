		<content>  Farming is the main industry in this 
 area.The size of the farms vary from  
 under 40 acres to over 450 acres.     
  Sheep farming is the main concern and
 on the largest farms flocks of 300 to 
 400 sheep increase to over 700 in the 
 lambing season. A secondary line is   
 calf rearing and therefore most of the
 land is pasture to provide grazing for
 these two lines.                      
  There is not a great deal of dairy   
 farming since one of the largest      
 farms,Norton Court,sold all their     
 dairy herd and milking machinery in   
 June 1985.                            
  Crops grown are maize,wheat,barley   
 and sugar beet.                       
  White House Farm has 50 acres of     
 blackcurrant bushes which yield 100 to
 140 tons of fruit.These go to Beechams
 at Coleford for Ribena.The farm's     
 cider apples go to Bulmers of Hereford</content>
