		<content> It is interesting to compare the      
 settlement pattern within this area   
 with that shown on the original       
 drawings (made at a scale of 2 inches 
 to 1 mile) by the Ordnance Survey in  
 1814. This was the source from which  
 the 1st Edition of the One Inch to One
 Mile map was prepared and published in
 1831.Another important source is the  
 Tithe Map for Cray parish, produced in
 1840.  Copies of these maps are held  
 in the National Library of Wales in   
 Aberystwyth.                          
 Of the thirty houses shown on these   
 and modern maps, 22 have remained un- 
 changed  since 1814, seven houses have
 disappeared (all since 1840) and 1 new
 house has been built.
