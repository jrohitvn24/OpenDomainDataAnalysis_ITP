		<title>07Plant life around Gwynfryn</title>
		<content>  Gwynfryn is botanically interesting  
 because it has large areas of         
 undisturbed pasture.The soil is thin  
 and poor with large rocks scattered   
 about.For this reason there is not    
 much farming and no fertiliser is used
 on the land.                          
  Many wild plants can be found here.  
 They include plants that are mostly   
 rare in other parts of the country.In 
 spring there are thousands of cowslips
 and during the year we can see some of
 the less common plants like Salad     
 Burnet,Kidney Vetch,Goat's Beard,Wall 
 Rue and six different species of      
 orchid.All these can be found within  
 one mile of the village.              
  The isolated position of the area    
 means that not many visitors come to  
 the area to pick and trample on       
 flowers.                              
                                       </content>
