		<title>16TREFRIFAWR FARM ABERDYFI</title>
		<content>    As we walked through the farmyard  
 gate the first thing that struck me   
 was the rather quaint grey stone      
 farmhouse.It was double fronted with  
 two chimneys.The farmyard was         
 fascinating;free range chickens ran   
 about,a sheepdog lay silently watching
 every move,orphaned lambs were in a   
 small enclosure and noisy geese       
 paraded near their pond.It was        
 interesting to see that a shallow part
 of the pond had been set aside for    
 newts and frogs.Mr.Roberts,the        
 farmer,explained that he had always   
 been fascinated by these small        
 creatures.The farmer sheared a sheep  
 for us.I was surprised to see his     
 hands dripping with greese from the   
 fleece and to hear that it would earn 
 only Â£1/Â£1.50.I thought Mr.Roberts was
 a very caring man.{Written by a 12
