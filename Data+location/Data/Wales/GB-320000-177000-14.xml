		<title>14BALCH'S FARM</title>
		<content> THE FARMS IN THIS AREA ARE MAINLY     
 SMALL, AND BALCH'S FARM IS TYPICAL.THE
 TWO FIELDS OF ABOUT 6 ACRES IN        
 TOTAL,ARE RENTED FROM THE LOCAL       
 COUNCIL AND A HORSE,FOAL AND GOAT ARE 
 KEPT ON THEM.OUR FRIEND'S DAD GOES OUT
 TO WORK TURVING WHILE THE MUM LOOKS   
 AFTER THE CHILDREN AND ANIMALS.THE    
 ANIMALS ARE 2 HORSES,A GOAT,SEVERAL   
 CHICKENS,A COCK,A BANTAM,3 DOGS,A     
 CAT,GOLD FISH AND 3 FINCHES.THE       
 TROUBLES THEY HAVE ARE FROM THE GYPSY 
 HORSES WHICH EAT THE GRASS AND MATE   
 THE MARE,SO NOW SHE IS IN FOAL AND    
 CAN'T BE RIDDEN FOR 6 MONTHS.THE CROWS
 EAT THE CHICKS AND THE WEASELS AND    
 FOXES WILL TRY TO EAT THE HENS.THE    
 MOLES MAKE AN AWFUL MESS OF THE FIELDS
  AND HAVE TO BE KEPT DOWN. THE LAND   
 GETS VERY WET IN THE WINTER BECAUSE IT
 IS LOW AND NEAR THE RIVER.THE DRAINS  
 ROUND HERE ARE CALLED REENS.          </content>
