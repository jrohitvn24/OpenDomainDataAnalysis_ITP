		<content> My name is Helen Ovens.I live near a  
 little village called Talybont in a   
 rural area.It is quite a peaceful     
 place except for the noise of the     
 birds,animals and insects.Around the  
 village are scattered houses and      
 farms,green fields and narrow,twisting
 roads with tall hedges,long grass and 
 wild flowers on either side.The air   
 here is a lot cleaner and fresher than
 in the towns and cities.One of the    
 reasons is because a lot of people    
 have wood fires instead of coal fires 
 and wood does not give off a sooty    
 smell.There are many small woods and  
 forests here in the countryside,some  
 are old Oak woods and others are      
 Larch,planted by the Forestry         
 Commision and farmers.                
    In and between the fields and woods
 are lots of streams,coming down from  
 the hills.                            </content>
