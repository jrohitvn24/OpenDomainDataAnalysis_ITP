		<title>15Leisure and Recreation</title>
		<content>  We did a survey about how people     
 spend their leisure and recreation    
 time.Most people enjoy watching       
 television.Many people wanted to      
 watch and play sports,but they had to 
 go out of the area for this.There are 
 no sports or leisure centres in the   
 area and many people thought that this
 was a much needed facility.People like
 to play bingo but they cannot play    
 locally.Already two social clubs have 
 closed down.The nearest place for     
 playing bingo is the Blaen-y-Maes     
 Community Centre.                     
   It can be said that most people     
 wanted improvements made in leisure   
 and recreation facilities in this     
 area.They said they wanted more parks 
 and more places to spend their leisure
 time.They would also like more youth  
 clubs and more swimming pools.
