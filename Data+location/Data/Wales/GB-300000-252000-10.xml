		<title>10PENCERRIG PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was built about 120 years  
 ago by Mrs.Clara Thomas for the       
 children of Pencerrig estate workers  
 and tenants. When the 2 railway lines 
 wre built it was enlarged to          
 accommodate the railway families      
 living at the new village at this     
 important railway junction at Builth  
 Road. Since the closure of one line   
 and the decline of the other, there   
 are no railway workers now. The       
 population has declined to such an    
 extent that this school is to be      
 closed in July 1986 and our remaining 
 children transferred to Llanelwedd or 
 Newbridge schools,(where rolls are    
 also falling). We are told that a     
 great deal of money will be saved by  
 closing this school, but it is very   
 sad that it is considered an economic 
 necessity to close these small rural  
 schools which have taught so well.    </content>
