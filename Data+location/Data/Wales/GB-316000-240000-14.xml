{St.Cynidr's Well.}St.Cynidr was the   
 first man to bring Christianity to the
 area.                                 
 It is said that Oliver Cromwell's     
 troops stopped to water their horses  
 at the well.This is the only time the 
 well has been dry.                    
 Today there is a wooden shelter over  
 the well erected in memory of Walter  
 Fenwick DeWinton of Maesllwch Castle  
 who was killed in action in South     
 Africa.The inscription reads "Draw    
 water from the well of Salvation."    
 (Isaiah chapt.12 verse 3.)            
{Superstition. }                       
 Superstition has grown up around the  
 well.It is said that a woman wishing  
 to have a child must go to the well,  
 make a wish,and wait to see a bubble  
 rise.If this happens,she will soon    
 have a child.                         </content>
