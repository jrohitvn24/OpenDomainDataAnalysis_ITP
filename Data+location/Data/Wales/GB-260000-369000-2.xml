		<title>02Penrhyn Castle</title>
		<content>    Penrhyn Castle is 150 years old, it
 was built in 1820 by Thomas Hopper.He 
 was commisioned by G.H.Dawkins        
 Pennant.The money to build it came    
 from the Penrhyn slate quarries near  
 Bethesda.In 1951 the present owner of 
 the castle Lady Janet Pennant sold it 
 to the National Trust.The castle is   
 now run by agents of the National     
 Trust.                                
        Penrhyn Castle is not really a 
 castle but built in castle form.It has
 4 towers,and over the arched doorway  
 there are sculptured faces of         
 mythological figures.The castle's     
 turrets,arches and fortifications make
 it look much older than it actually   
 is.
