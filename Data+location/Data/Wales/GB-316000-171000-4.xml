 Cogan School is a nice school. It is  
 a primary school. It has 210 pupils.  
 There are 8 class teachers and Mrs    
 Saunders is the Head Teacher. We      
 have 1 supply teacher and a helper    
 called Mrs.Jeans. Our school          
 secretary is called Mrs.Lowe.         
 Mrs.Brookman helps children with      
 their maths and reading. When the     
 pupils leave the school they go on    
 to St.Cyres Comprehensive School. In  
 our school we wear a uniform. The     
 girls wear a blue or grey skirt,      
 white blouse, striped blue tie and a  
 blue jumper. The boys wear navy or    
 grey trousers, white shirt, tie and   
 jumper. Last year our school was 100  
 years old. It was our centenary. The  
 girls wore white pinafores and the    
 boys wore stiff white collars. .      </content>
