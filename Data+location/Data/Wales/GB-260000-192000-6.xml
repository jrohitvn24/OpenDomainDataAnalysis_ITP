		<content> A survey at Parkland Primary School   
 suggested that there was little       
 unemployment in Sketty Park Estate.   
 Many parents are involved in          
 Education,from Nursery teachers to    
 University professors. Most others are
 in professional employment or are self
 employed. The price of houses in the  
 area means that people need a large   
 salary to keep up their standard of   
 living. In our class of 28 children   
 only 5 were born in the area. the     
 others moved into the area when their 
 fathers gained promotion. Only a small
 proportion of children in our school  
 have free school meals, but in the    
 older council estates, such as        
 Townhill, there is considerable       
 unemployment and a large number of    
 children there have free meals.
