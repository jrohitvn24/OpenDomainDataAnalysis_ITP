		<title>06TOURISM (LAMPHEY)</title>
		<content> The Lamphey area lies in the heart of 
 the South Pembrokeshire tourist area. 
 There are many caravan sites in the   
 area as well as blocks of holiday     
 flats in Freshwater East. Numerous    
 farms as well as private householders 
 offer bed and breakfast accomodation. 
 As a result much employment in the    
 area is geared towards this rather    
 seasonal trade.                       
 The main attraction of the area is the
 very well known coastline. There are  
 numerous safe beaches for bathing,    
 surfing and fishing. The coastal path 
 is famous throughout Britain.         
 The flora and fauna of this region    
 attract many people each year.        
 The castles in the area such as       
 Pembroke, Carew and Manorbier are also
 magnets for tourists.
