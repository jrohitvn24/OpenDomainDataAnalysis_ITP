		<title>19Employment</title>
		<content>  The traditional employment of the    
 area has been based on agriculture    
 and the railways.Over the years       
 ,however people have tended to move   
 away from these traditional areas,and 
 now work in the nearby towns of       
 Cardiff ,Newport and Bristol.         
  Recently ,with  large international  
 companies establishing their bases in 
 the locality employment can again be  
 offered to local people nearer to     
 home.Of these companies, the Whitbread
 Brewery in Magor in the largest single
 employer.                             
  As Magor is located along the M4     
 motorway in what is called the        
 "Silicon Corridor" many micro-electric
 companies have moved to the area.Many 
 of the newcomers to the village are   
 employed in these industries.
