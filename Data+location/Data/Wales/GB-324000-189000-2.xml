		<title>02TY SIGN ESTATE</title>
		<content> We live on the Ty Sign Estate. This is
 a large estate of houses built above  
 the town of RISCA which is about 4    
 miles from NEWPORT. The estate was    
 first built about 20 years ago and was
 originally solely a council estate    
 built for workers at the then new     
 LLANWERN steel works. The streets on  
 the original estate are all named     
 after trees (Elm Drive, Sycamore      
 Crescent, Forsythia Close etc). Today 
 there are two large private estates on
 the site as well and always more      
 building going on.                    
 There are not many social facilities  
 on the estate, just one pub, one club 
 and two churches but there are more in
 Risca which is only minutes away.     
 There is a lot of unemployment among  
 the people on the estate, especially  
 since the steel works was             
 "streamlined" some years ago.         </content>
