		<title>06HOMELIFE IN TREDEGAR 1985</title>
		<content>    Our class did a survey of          
families.  We found out that the       
average number of children is 2-4.     
Not many people have gradparents       
living with them in the same house.    
Only 2 children were born in another   
town apart from tredegar. Few families 
live in bungalows or flats, most live  
in houses.                             
    Modern homes of 1985 are very      
comfortable, because of insulation,    
double-glazing, central-heating and    
furnishings.  We made a graph to see   
who had videos, music-centres and      
microwave ovans, most people had some  
of these.  We've all got carpets,      
curtains and comfortable.              
    There are many kinds of leisure    
activities we can do at home such as   
music centres, TV and videos. There    
are also leisure activities to do out  
side such as sports and youth clubs.   </content>
