    I get up at 8 a.m., have breakfast 
 of toast and jam, and then my mother  
 drives me to school, arriving at about
 8:45. I play with my friend Joanne,   
 until the bell goes at 9:00 a.m.      
    We all go into the hall for        
 assembly, and then during the morning 
 we do reading, mathematics, Welsh and 
 English. We have playtime at 10:30.   
    The bell goes for lunch at 12:00   
 and I stay in school and have a school
 dinner.                               
    In the afternoon we sometimes have 
 science, spelling, interest, swimming 
 or games. We have playtime at 2:20 and
 we go home at 3:30.                   
    I change my clothes and go out to  
 play for a while. I have tea, watch TV
 and do my homework, then I have supper
 and go to bed at 9:00 p.m.            </content>
