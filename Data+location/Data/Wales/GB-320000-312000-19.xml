		<title>19A Typical Family Weekend.</title>
		<content> We practiced for our Anniversary which
 was to take place in the afternoon.My 
 brother spent the day at a friend's   
 house,while Dad went out working      
 again.Mum and Gilian did a little work
 on the farm.At lunch time,we had a    
 traditional Sunday dinner.            
    In the afternoon,my mother and I   
 went to the Anniversary at the Chapel.
 I sang in the choir,and also sang a   
 solo.It was only a small Chapel but it
 was full for the Anniversary,which is 
 always popular.                       
    Later in the day we had a walk     
 around our farm and then visited some 
 friends about 4 miles away."
