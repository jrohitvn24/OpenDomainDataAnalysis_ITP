		<title>12    MILK QUOTAS</title>
		<content> In 1984 the European Common Market    
 decided that too  much milk was being 
 produced by dairy farmers and that the
 production of milk would have to be   
 cut by 10%.The farmers became very    
 angry as they would lose money and    
 have to sell some of their cattle.    
    In April 1984,Mr Michael Joplin the
 Minister of Agriculture came to the   
 village of LLangadog for a meeting.The
 village was packed with angry farmers 
 from all over Dyfed who had come to   
 demonstrate against the milk quotas.  
 Milk was sprayed on the roads,cars and
 tractors were used to block all the   
 roads leading out of the village,and  
 Mr.Joplin had to remain in the village
 Community Centre for a long time.He   
 was later allowed to leave after      
 agreeing to to talk to some of the    
 farmers about the milk quotas.
