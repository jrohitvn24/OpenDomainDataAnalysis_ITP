		<title>17LIFE IN PLASMARL, SWANSEA</title>
		<content>   Many people think Plasmarl is a     
 boring place, but if you look around  
 you will find many interesting things.
   There are many local pubs around    
 Plasmarl for older people, where they 
 can have a quiet drink and a chat or  
 play snooker or darts. Sometimes there
 is also entertainment.                
   For younger children there are      
 activities such as Cubs and Brownies  
 held in St. Paul's Church. For older  
 children there are Scouts and Guides. 
 Children who take an interest in      
 sport can practise a variety of events
 at the Morfa Stadium. For those       
 children who like dancing there is a  
 club called the "Peppermint", where   
 they meet new friends and learn to    
 dance to different types of music.    
   The community also has the use of a 
 hall in Dinas Street for parties and  
 Bingo.                                </content>
