   Mrs. Davies keeps her sheep mainly  
 for meat.They are Welsh Mountain Sheep
 and the wool is of poor quality and   
 does not fetch much money. The animals
 are {shorn }at the end of June.  The  
 wool comes off the sheep like a mat.  
 It is then rolled into a ball, put    
 into bags and taken to the Wool       
 Producers of Wales in Brecon. Here it 
 is sorted and processed.              
   The Davies' are always busy. They   
 get up at 6.30 each morning to fit in 
 all the jobs. There are all sorts of  
 things to be done but spring and      
 summer are the busiest times of the   
 year.  Often they employ casual       
 labourers to help particularly at     
 lambing, shearing and hay-making time.</content>
