		<content>      Agriculture is the main          
 occupation of the area.  Dairying is  
 the primary form of farming, although 
 some sheep are reared on the hilly    
 areas.  All farms have modern         
 equipment, especially milking         
 equipment, because bulk tankers now   
 collect the milk.  The milk is        
 delivered to the Milk Marketing Board 
 Factory at Carmarthen.                
      A large part of the area is good 
 pasture land, although some fields are
 kept for silage and hay.  The hedges  
 are well maintained.                  
      The animals kept on these farms  
 are mostly fresian cattle which are   
 black and white, together with a few  
 other breeds.  Dogs, cats, pigs,      
 goats, horses, hens, ducks and geese  
 are also kept.                        
      A small amount of root crop is   
 grown on some farms.                  </content>
