		<content> EDUCATION - BODELWYDDAN CASTLE        
 This is situated in the parkland      
 adjoining the area under discussion   
 but the Castle itself comes into the  
 given area.  In 1984 the Castle was   
 purchased by Clwyd County Council as  
 an education establishment.  The last 
 previous owner had run an independent 
 boarding school for girls at the      
 Castle which was then known as Lowther
 College.  The main purpose of the     
 Clwyd County Council is to run the    
 place as a centre for computer        
 technology amongst other things.      
 Local comprehensive schools are       
 encouraged to use it for their fifth  
 and sixth formers to further their    
 knnowledge in computer science.  Some 
 of these courses are residential.     
 Specialist staff have been engaged to 
 teach at the centre.
