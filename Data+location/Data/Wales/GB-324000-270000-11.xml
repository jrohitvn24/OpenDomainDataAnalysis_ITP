		<content>   In addition to opportunities for    
 employment in Knighton itself is the  
 Garth Lane slaughterers and pet food  
 factory employing 11 people. Built in 
 1983/84 it deals with about 20        
 wholesalers all over Great Britain,one
 of whom retails it to Iceland.The     
 company owns four slaughter houses    
 which collect casualty animals from   
 vets and farms.The hides are sent for 
 tanning and sold to manufacturers of  
 clothing and leather wear.The raw     
 flesh  meat is sold to Bewdley and    
 Woburn Abbey Safari Parks and Zoos.   
  The one-time labour intensive farming
 now shrunk to the average employment  
 figure of one full time employee per  
 farm especially where family          
 assistance was availible.             
   Women either are employed in        
 Knighton or work at home. Some of     
 their homes are farms.                </content>
