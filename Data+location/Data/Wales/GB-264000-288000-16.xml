		<content> Chapels and Churches Cont.            
{Tabernacl}(Babtist) is the smallest   
 chapel as regards members-there are 18
 of them ,and no Minister.The cause was
 started in Talybont in 1803 and the   
 members met in each others homes until
 the chapel was built in 1812.Under the
 deacons seat there is a font where the
 members are baptised.                 
    The present St David's Church was  
 built in 1909,but there was an earlier
 mission church built of corrugated    
 zinc on a diffrent site.The house wich
 now stands on the particular is called
 'Henllan'(Old Church).There are 62    
 members at St David's and the Parish  
 Church is Llanfihangel Genau'r        
 Glyn,some two miles away.At one time  
 there was a Curate in charge living in
 Talybont,but for many years now the   
 church has been looked after by the   
 Vicar of Llanfihangel.                </content>
