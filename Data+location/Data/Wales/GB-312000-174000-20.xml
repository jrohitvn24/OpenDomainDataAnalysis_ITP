		<content> pick teams and one team has to call   
 out a name and they say "Red Rover,   
 Red Rover we call over Clare Smith".  
 Then Clare Smith has to run up and    
 they both have to run to see whether  
 they get through the peoples hands. If
 they do they go back to their team but
 if they don't they have to stop with  
 the other team.                       
  4 Skipping                           
 In the play ground we play games like 
 skipping, two people hold the rope    
 and one or two or three people can    
 skip in the middle. If there are three
 people you can play right side, wrong 
 side, a person finishing on the side  
  is out.                              
  5 Mob                                
 When it is dark we go out, one boy    
 goes on it he counts to a hundred and 
 we hide. He comes to look for us, if  
 he goes past us we run out and mob him</content>
