		<title>02The Docks Continued</title>
		<content> Masons labourers and excavators who   
 had come to build the dock and railway
 were housed by the Railway Company in 
 the streets called Company Row and    
 Dock Street. By the end  of the       
 19th.century much of the trade of     
 Penarth Dock had been taken by the    
 new, larger dock at Barry. It         
 gradually fell into disuse.           
 It was used in the Second World War   
 but was finally closed in 1962. Since 
 then it has been used as an anchorage 
 for pleasure boats and private yachts.
 Redevelopment has this year begun to  
 change the area. The sea end          
 (03180712) will be made into a marina 
 for private moorings and two hundred  
 houses while the land end will be     
 filled in to accommodate industrial   
 buildings. This is due for completion 
 in 1992 at a cost of Â£12 million.
