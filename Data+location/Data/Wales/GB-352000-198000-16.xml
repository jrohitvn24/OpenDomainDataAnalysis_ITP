		<title>16THE ENGLAND/WALES BORDER</title>
		<content>  This stretch of the River Wye forms a
 natural boundary between England and  
 Wales,the English county being        
 Gloucestershire,and the Welsh county  
 Gwent which was originally            
 Monmouthshire.                        
  In this area there is no road        
 connection between England and Wales, 
 access between the two being only by  
 an ancient footbridge.                
  As Gwent was originally Monmouthshire
 the people are English speaking       
 although the gift shops are full of   
 Welsh souvenirs.                      
  The division causes the area to be   
 represented by two different Members  
 of Parliament and to be under separate
 local and national government         
 authorities.However the whole area    
 falls under the same telephone        
 exchange and postal address.
