		<title>12THE LIFE OF A VICAR.</title>
		<content> Mr. Tudor Jones has been the vicar of 
 this Parish for six years. He has four
 Anglican Churches. They are Llangiwg  
 (named after Saint Ciwg who lived in  
 the sixth century), St. Mary's at     
 Ynysmeudwy, St. Peter's (often called 
 the 'Cathedral of the valley') and All
 Saints Church.                        
     All Saints Church is particularly 
 interesting. It is not an old church. 
 It is only one hundred years old. It  
 was built by a wealthy landowner in   
 the district as a private church - his
 name was Gillbertson and he and his   
 family owned several large houses in  
 the area. Today All Saints Church is  
 unusual. It is used by people both of 
 the Anglican and the Catholic faith.  
 They have agreed to share the costs of
 the running and upkeep of the church.
