		<title>01CWMBRAN - GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content>    Our area of study covers the heart 
 of the New Town of Cwmbran, comprising
 the modern shopping centre and the    
 surrounding residential areas.  The   
 New Town encompasses the old villages 
 of Pontnewydd and Cwmbran, and the    
 former, still a small, lively shopping
 centre, is in close proximity to both 
 schools.    The main road and rail    
 links and the now disused canal run   
 North-South through the centre of the 
 area following closely the course of  
 the Afon Lwyd river and serve a spine 
 of engineering works.  A large        
 industrial estate of unit engineering 
 works and 'hi-tech' developments lies 
 to the South West occupying the site  
 of a former colliery and foundry.  The
 Western edge of the area borders the  
 lower slopes of Mynydd Maen while to  
 the North and East is land mainly used
 for mixed farming.                    </content>
