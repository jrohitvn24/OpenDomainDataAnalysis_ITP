		<title>16The Brynmaen Burial Ground</title>
		<content> There is a{Quaker Burial Ground}in the
 grounds  of  'Bwlchyddwyallt' (26/62),
 (formerly Brynmaen).     It dates from
 1698,  and  has been disused  for many
 years.    There are many references to
 the graveyard in  'The Carmarthenshire
 Antiquary' (esp.no.176-July 10th 1908)
 relating to the size-22ft by 24ft 8in,
 surrounded  by a 5ft  6ins wall,  this
 varies slightly with each mention.    
 There  are  many notes  on the upkeep,
 repairs and changes of ownership.   In
 1870  we learn  that the Neath   (West
 Glamorgan) Quakers,  a strong  church,
 were called upon to see the   state of
 the graveyard.   Mr. Frederick Gibbons
 came and entrusted the repair  of the 
 walls and the placing of a strong iron
 gate (Still there today) to the tenant
 of Brynmaen,John Thomas.   The gate is
 inscribed  with  the  words   'Friends
 Burial Ground 1870'                   </content>
