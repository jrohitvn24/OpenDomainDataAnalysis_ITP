		<content>   My favourite hobby is FISHING. I    
 have two rods for catching fish and   
 two reels. The earliest I have ever   
 got up to go fishing is 4.00am.  We   
 arrived at the canal at 4.20am, but I 
 didn't catch any fish until 5.15am.   
 I caught 12 fish, mostly Eels and     
 Bream, but we didn't take them home   
 because we don't like to eat them.    
   I often go CLAY PIDGEON SHOOTING at 
 a field in Boughton, it is very       
 interesting. A man opens a trap door  
 when you shout "pull", then an orange 
 disc flies into the air. You fire at  
 this with a gun and hope to hit it!   
   Sometimes I go TRAIN SPOTTING - I   
 look closely at the train numbers and 
 record them. I usually go to Crewe    
 Station, my favourite train is the    
 50.29XE RENOWN.
