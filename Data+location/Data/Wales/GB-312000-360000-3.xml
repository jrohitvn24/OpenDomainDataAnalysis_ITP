		<content> Gellifor has a rather large shop and  
 it is very well stocked.Above there is
 a small flat.The shop is situated     
 behind the chapel.Inside there is a   
 burglar alarm fixed on the door where 
 no one can see it.A few months ago new
 windows were put in with dark glass so
 that the food will not go stale. Local
 people and people from afar use the   
 shop.The old people are the ones who  
 use it the most because they have no  
 transport,or the buses are too late or
 expensive to go to Denbigh or         
 Ruthin.The shop closed for a few      
 months about a year ago. While it was 
 being sold people missed it,especially
 the children because they had to go to
 Llandyrnog,Denbigh or Ruthin for      
 sweets and their favorite comics.
