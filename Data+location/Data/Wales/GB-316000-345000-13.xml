		<content> There is also a field named{Acer-Ddu  
 (black acre) in which the soldiers who
 fought a great battle at{Cae-Llewelyn 
 (field of Llewelyn) are buried. There 
 is a hill called{Rhiw-Goch}(redhill). 
 It was supposed to have turned red    
 with  the soldiers blood.There is also
{Rhyd-Goch}(red ford) which is also    
 supposed to have turned red with      
 blood. One day Llewelyn took his two  
 sons to the top of the mountain and   
 said to one{"Dyma Cwm-Tydi"}which     
 means here is your valley, and he said
 to his other son{"Dacw Cwm o" (Cymmo) 
 which  means 'here is his valley'.    
 These are the names given to the      
 farms.
