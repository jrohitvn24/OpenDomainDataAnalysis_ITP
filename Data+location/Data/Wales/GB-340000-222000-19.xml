		<content> If one of the dens get blown up we use
 the other one.We have four guns each. 
 Roby is always getting into trouble.  
 This game has no rules.We all like    
 playing Robots.                       
{    Wayne likes to play Fox and       
{Hounds. }                             
 At School we play Fox and Hounds.We   
 have three lives,because the hounds   
 have to catch the fox.There are two   
 foxes and there are as many hounds as 
 we like.Some times we have two dens,  
 because it is easier.We play in the   
 field,because we have to get the fox  
 on the ground but you mustn't hurt    
 him.A hound has one life.The hounds   
 can't get in the foxes' den.Two foxes 
 can beat one hound but the fox can    
 struggle to get away.One den is by the
 large black gate at the bottom of the 
 field.The other den is a muddy patch  
 of ground in the corner of the field. </content>
