   Pembrey has a beautiful{twelfth     
{century Norman church}in the centre of
 the village.                          
   The church is in a superb state of  
 preseveration thanks to the skill and 
 crafstmanship of diligent workmen     
 throughout the ages.The tower is      
 approximately 70ft high, 25ft square  
 at the base and 23ft square at the    
 top.There is a sundial above the porch
 door.                                 
   Inside the church is a{Hagioscope}or
 Squint. On the arch of the South-East 
 window in the knave are 8{Hatchments}.
 They probably represent the arms of   
 deceased Lords of the Manor.          
   Attatched to the outside of the     
 South-West wall is a{Ffald}or{Pound,} 
 formerly used to impound stray cattle.
 This is now one of the best preserved 
 in Wales.                             </content>
