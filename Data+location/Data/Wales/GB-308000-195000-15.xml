		<title>15INTERVIEW WITH A POSTMASTER</title>
		<content> Interview with Mr. Hopkins postmaster 
 ------------------------------------- 
 at Edwardsville post office.          
 -----------------------------         
 We visited the postmaster at          
 Edwardsville post office and after    
 asking many questions we were able to 
 deduce the following information. Mr. 
 Hopkins has been sub-postmaster at    
 Edwardsville for thirty five years.   
 The post office has been on its       
 presant site since 1915. Previously it
 had been in the bicycle shop on the   
 main Cardiff to Merthyr road but that 
 building was badly damaged by the     
 tornado in 1913. As many post offices 
 these days sell other things e.g.     
 sweets, soft drinks etc., we asked Mr.
 Hopkins why he did not. He said that  
 they had sold sweets but due to ill   
 health he had to give up half of his  
 shop and now it is a postoffice.      </content>
