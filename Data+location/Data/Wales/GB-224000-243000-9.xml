		<title>09Farming Patterns in Dyfed</title>
		<content> Of the area's dozen and a half farms, 
 half remain as dairy farms with herds 
 of between thity and  hundred.        
 Friesand predominate but there is also
 a small herd of Jerseys and a pedigree
 herd of Shorthorns who are regularly  
 champions at the Royal Welsh Show.    
 Bef fattning and sheep breding are the
 most important enterprises after      
 dairying.  The sheep are of many      
 different lowland breeds while the    
 cattle are mainly Friesan, Hereford   
 and Charolais.  A new way of          
 supplementing the farm income has     
 been tried, with some success, by two 
 armers in the area who now cater for  
 tourists, providing self-catering     
 accommodation or bed and breakfast in 
 the farmhouse. At Treaes Fawr high    
 quality Welsh cobs and Welsh Mountain 
 ponies are bred. 40 mares are kept    
 many are exported for breeding.       </content>
