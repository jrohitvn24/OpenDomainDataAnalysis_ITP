		<content> There are only 4 places of worship in 
 this rectangle of Porthcawl-All Saints
 Church,Weslian Methodist Church,      
 Congregational Church and a Gospel    
 Mission Hall.There are however many   
 more in the area, in fact nearly all  
 the Non-Conformist Churches are       
 represnted here as well as th Roman   
 Catholic Church and the Church in     
 Wales.                                
 All Saints Church in Church Place had 
 its roots in a Sailors Mission near   
 the old dock.The congregation grew so 
 rapidly that the building became      
 inadequate,so the congregation moved  
 to new buildings in Lias Road(became  
 the National School).Finally in 1891  
 All Saints Church was constructed,    
 originally entirely of iron,later     
 converted into stone for Â£10,000.
