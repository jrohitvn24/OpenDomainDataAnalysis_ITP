		<content>  January 31 at the other end of the   
 parishthe funeral of Mrs Elen         
 Willians.There were no V.I.Ps,only a  
 fair number of local people braving   
 the winter weather.                   
  In contrast to Lord Harlech's life,  
 she had spent most of hers scratching 
 a livelyhood on her small hillside    
 farm.She received very little         
 education and rarely travelled beyond 
 sight of the farm. She died after a   
 short illness and was 84 years old.   
  The wealth that she had, she took    
 with her in her amiable personality,  
 her ability to portray life in the    
 past and a sound knowledge of Welsh   
 sayings and idioms.                   
  She too bore crosses losing two sons 
 aged 7 and 9 in a tragic accident,    
 drowning in a local lake which was    
 frozen.Her husband died soon after.
