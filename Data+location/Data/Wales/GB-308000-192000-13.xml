		<title>13Abercynon fire station</title>
		<content> Mid Glam is the local{goverment}      
 responsible for the {fire service.    
 Ther is one sub-station in our        
 Domesday Block.1941 brought the       
 nationisation of the fire service and 
 the first professional fire officer to
{Abercynon.The first purpose built     
{station opened in 1975 on the site of 
{the old Abercynon canal basin.Today   
{there is one fire engine and a        
{jeep,for forest fires.Thirteen firemen
{work in the station but only five at  
{a time are called to go to a fire.30% 
{of their calls are false alarms.In the
{fire engine you need one leader,one   
{driver and three men to put the fire  
{out.None of the firemen in Abercynon  
{are full time and they have to live   
{within four minutes travel to get to  
{the fire station.The furthest distance
{they have travelled is about 40 km.
