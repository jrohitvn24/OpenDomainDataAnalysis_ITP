		<content>     We have three grocer shops,one    
 butcher shop,a draper shop,a newsagent
 shop,and one pet shop which also sells
 angling equipment.We have a local     
 baker who sells bread in our village  
 and surrounding areas.Thirty years ago
 there were three bakers producing     
 bread locally.                        
     We rely on private cars to move in
 and out of our village.The train      
 service was withdrawn in June 1964 and
 the bus service has been reduced to an
 hourly since April 1985.
