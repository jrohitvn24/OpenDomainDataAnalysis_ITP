		<content> All homes in Gladestry now have       
 electricity. There are a lot of things
 using it. When our parents were little
 there were hardly any. Everyone has   
 radios but we don't use them much. All
 homes have at least one colour        
 television. Most of us watch a lot.   
 Only three have video recorders for   
 copying TV programmes or playing      
 tapes. Everyone has record players to 
 play long playing records, but no-one 
 has a compact(laser) disc player. Two 
 children in our class have computers, 
 but they only use them for games. Most
 people have pocket calculators but we 
 don't use them in school yet. More    
 than half of the children have digital
 watches, but some still have clockwork
 ones. Everyone has telephones. There  
 are some new ones with push buttons   
 but most are the sort with a dial to  
 choose the numbers.                   </content>
