		<content> We go to a Church in Wales High       
 School. There are about 1082 pupils   
 from parishes all over S. Glam. In    
 1984-5 the biggest group came from    
 Llandaff Cathedral parish (182) and   
 from Whitchurch and Rhiwbina parish   
 (190). We also have some Methodists   
 and Roman Catholics. Every morning we 
 have an assembly lasting about 25     
 minutes. On Tuesday the vicars from   
 most parishes come to conduct a       
 service for the pupils from their     
 parish. Once every half term we go to 
 the Cathedral, which is not far away  
 from us, for a Eucharist service.     
 Religious education lessons are       
 compulsory. We take many other        
 different subjects. Most of the pupils
 travel to school by bus or car. Those 
 who live in Llandaff walk or ride     
 bikes to school.
