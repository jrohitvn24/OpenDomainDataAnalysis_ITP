		<title>12ANIMALS IN PENNARD.</title>
		<content> ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MAMMALS IN     
 PENNARD IS THE RABBIT.YOU CAN SEE THEM
 AT DUSK AND EARLY IN THE MORNING. NOW 
 THE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING AND THEY   
 ARE BECOMING A NUISANCE. ON THE WAY   
 UP FROM POBBLES BEACH THERE IS A SMALL
 RABBIT WARREN WITH HOLES THAT BRANCH  
 OFF IN TO A MAZE OF TUNNELS. WILD     
 PONIES ARE FOUND IN PENNARD TOO. THEY 
 ROAM INTO PEOPLE'S GARDENS AND ROAM   
 AROUND THE STREETS.THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE
 NEAR FEED THEM.SOME HOUSES HAVE CATTLE
 GRIDS AND OUR SCHOOL DOES, SO THE     
 PONIES CAN NOT GET IN. OUR CLASS      
 COUNTED OVER THIRTY BIRDS THAT THEY   
 SEE IN OUR AREA AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR. 
 THEY INCLUDED OWLS, HERONS, BUZZARDS, 
 KESTRELS AND TREE CREEPERS. FOXHOLE IS
 THE NEAREST BEACH TO ME AND I GO THERE
 OFTEN. ON THIS BEACH YOU CAN FIND LOTS
 OF CREATURES IN THE ROCK POOLS AND IN 
 THE SAND.I FOUND A TROPICAL BEAN THERE</content>
