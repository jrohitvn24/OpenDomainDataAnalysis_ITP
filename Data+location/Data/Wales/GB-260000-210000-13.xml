		<title>13TRAFFIC IN AMMANFORD</title>
		<content>  A traffic count was carried out for  
 half an hour on a Friday morning, on  
 Ammanford Square.The A474, A483(T),   
 and a minor road form a crossroads in 
 the town centre.Traffic lights and    
 Pelican crossings control the flow of 
 traffic through the square. The survey
 count was as follows:                 
                 {Vans +               
{            Cars:lorries:M/Bykes:Buses
{Wind St.   }180    40       3      4  
{High St.   }122    30       4      0  
{Quay St.   }113    26       2      1  
{College St.}147    28       3      2  
                                       
  From this, we find market day is a   
 very busy day.We see there are many   
 vans + lorries passing through but few
 buses serve the area.                 
  The M4 motorway,5 miles to the south 
 has led much traffic away from the    
 town and villages.                    </content>
