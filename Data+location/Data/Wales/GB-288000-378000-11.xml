 The A55 expressway starts in          
 Llanddulas .It took 3 and a half years
 to build.A Â£34.7 million contract was 
 shared between Fairclough and         
 Mc.Alpine. It was built by the sea so 
 sea defence was needed.They used      
 22,000 interlocking concrete blocks   
 called Dolos units.They look like a   
 Twisted H. In the future the road will
 be called E22- a European route.The   
 railway had to be rerouted and a new  
 bridge constructed.The road was opened
 on 7th December 1984 by Mr. Wyn       
 Roberts MP. for Conway.Most people    
 think the expressway is an improvement
 .Reasons are:no traffic jams,quicker  
 to get to places and keeping traffic  
 from Llanddulas.A small minority think
 it is bad because of mess and         
 noise.People are worried Colwyn Bay   
 will lose trade due to the expressway.</content>
