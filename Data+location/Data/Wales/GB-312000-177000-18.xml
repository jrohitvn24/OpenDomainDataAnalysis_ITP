		<content> After going on the road for about half
 a mile, we climbed over a gate, and   
 came to a spot where everything living
 was growing wild, and there was a hut 
 that looked like a bomb-shelter. We   
 all took it in turns to climb over    
 another gate and through what seemed  
 like a mini jungle, with its brambles 
 and bushes and leaves. Then we had a  
 rest by a bridge over a disused       
 railway line. Mr Mantle stepped down  
 to see if it was safe to cross. Then  
 Mr Mantle came up and said it was     
 dangerous,  so went through a field.  
 Inside the field, wheat was growing.  
 Nicola Good found an old sixpence. We 
 crossed a stream, and went through a  
 field with sheep in it so we had to be
 quiet. Then we made our way back to   
 school.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
