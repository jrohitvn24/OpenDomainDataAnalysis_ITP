 This map block covers an area at the  
 start of the South Wales Valleys.     
 It is dominated by the Garth Mountain 
 which is surrounded immediately by    
 three villages.                       
 Gwaelod-y-Garth is an old             
 mining village which clings to the    
 side of the Garth Mountain.           
 Efail Isaf is a small village on the  
 top of the mountain which is currently
 under threat of becoming an           
 overspill area for Cardiff.           
 Nantgarw is a mining village with a   
 working mine and from the Northern end
 of the village runs the Treforest     
 Industrial Estate which was built in  
 the 1930's and is now in decline.     
 On the south eastern corner of the    
 block is the village of Taffs Well -  
 the largest in the area and once      
 famous locally for it's healing spa.  </content>
