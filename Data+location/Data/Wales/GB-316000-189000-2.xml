		<content>             The majority of houses in 
 Cwmfelinfach are built from sandstone 
 which was dug from quarries on the    
 mountainsides around the village. Most
 of the houses are{terraced}into long  
 streets,very few are semidetached or  
 detached.The older houses were        
 originally built,about 70 years ago,  
 for miners so that they could live    
 near to the local mine. Nowadays      
 almost all of the houses have been    
{modernised}to give them hot and cold  
 running water,an indoor toilet and    
 bathroom,none of which were in the    
 houses originally. The miners' houses 
 have the stairs in a straight line    
 with the front door so that an injured
 miner could be taken to bed on a      
 stretcher very easily. Most houses are
 owned by the people living in them,   
 only some are rented. 45% of people   
 have moved to Cwm in the last 20years.</content>
