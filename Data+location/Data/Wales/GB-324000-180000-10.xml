		<title>10    SCHOOLING CHANGES</title>
		<content> Over the years there have been many   
 changes in school life.Buildings are  
 much lighter and airy.Teachers are    
 not as strict or cruel.Children no    
 longer sit in uncomfortable desks in  
 rows and tiers but in individual desks
 and chairs in groups.Lessons are more 
 relaxed and the pupils spend more time
 finding out for themselves rather than
 chanting replies to teachers          
 questions.More subjects besides       
 reading,writing,and arithmetic,have   
 come into present day schools like    
 art,craft,physical education,sewing,  
 dancing,and science.Children are      
 healthier as a result of better food  
 including school dinners.Most schools 
 have inside toilets.More teaching aids
 are now used e.g.television,radio,    
 computers,and calculaters.School has  
 become a livelier,happy place.
