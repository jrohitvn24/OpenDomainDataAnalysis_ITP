		<content> Here they keep and rear pheasants.    
 These are released into the local     
 woods and scrub land. There is approx.
 1 sq.km. of woodland in the area.     
 500 pheasants are released into each  
 wood. The keeper rears about 1000     
 pheasants a month. The farmers in this
 area are encouraged to keep some of   
 their land free from the plough       
 (either roughland or woodland). This  
 is to tempt game birds such as        
 pheasants, partridge and snipe onto   
 the land.                             
 The shooting season starts on the 1st 
 October till 1st February. It is a    
 very expensive sport, as it costs Â£200
 a day to shoot and the shooters can   
 only keep a brace (two) pheasants, no 
 matter how many they shoot. All the   
 other pheaseants shot are sold for    
 Â£1.75 each by the Llanarth estate.
