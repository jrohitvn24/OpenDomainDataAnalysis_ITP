		<content> There are very few farms in the       
 Llanddulas area.Infact there are only 
 five.Three are Mill Street,Beulah     
 Avenue,and Tan-yr-Ogo.Two of the farms
 are mentioned in the 18th century     
 parish registers.                     
 There are two old                     
 farmhouses in Llanddulas which are not
 classed as farms, but are ordinary    
 houses.They are Bron-y-Wendon and     
 TY-Ucha.The farm in Mill Street is    
 called Y Felin which means the Mill   
 and is owned by Mr. Cross.There used  
 to  be a water mill here.The farm in  
 Beulah Avenue is called               
 Bryn-Dulas.Mr.Ray owns owns a farm in 
 Beulah Avenue which is called         
 Bryn-Dulas.There used to be farms in  
 Llanddulas,but many have been         
 knocked down.Some farmers went to work
 in the quarry but some work in Colwyn 
 Bay.                                  </content>
