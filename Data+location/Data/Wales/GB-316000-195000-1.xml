		<content>      Situated totally in the Islwyn   
 Borough District. The area is split   
 centrally North to South by the       
 Sirhowy River which drains a deep     
 glaciated valley. The discovery of    
 coal led to a gradual                 
 industrialisation of the district,    
 first by levels then deep pits.       
 Blackwood is the commercial and       
 administrative centre. It has a       
 thriving shopping centre, open air    
 market and large Bus Station. Cefn    
 Fforest developed as  a village to    
 house Britania Colliery Miners,       
 Pontllanfraith is a strategic         
 crossroad site, previously an         
 important railway junction, and links 
 both sides of the river. The decline  
 of coal mining as the once dominent   
 industrial as been off set by modern  
 industrial areas bringing in          
 replacement work.                     </content>
