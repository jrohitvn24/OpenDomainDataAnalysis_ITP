 The recreation room is a very popular 
 meeting place in the village,and is   
 used by many organisations and clubs. 
 The building is made of wood and      
 comprises of a large hall with a      
 stage,snooker room,kitchen,pool room, 
 toilets and smaller store room.       
 Recently it has become popular to hire
 the room for birthday parties,with    
 plenty of room for a disco afterwards.
 Other users include the youth club,   
 which meets every Friday,an over 55   
 club,and a toddler group which meets  
 twice a week. Occasionally the hall   
 becomes a polling station for local   
 and general elections.Though there is 
 no telephone, the school opposite can 
 be used in emergencies.Fund raising   
 activities such as jumble sales are   
 also held there.
