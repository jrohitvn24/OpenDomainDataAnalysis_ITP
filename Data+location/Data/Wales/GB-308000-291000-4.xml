		<content> Tuesday and Saturdays are market days 
 in Newtown.One Tuesday we undertook a 
 survey of the market stalls.Most of   
 the stalls were located in Broad      
 Street and High Street,and in the     
 indoor market building.All the stalls 
 in the indoor market are occupied by  
 local traders.The stall holders in    
 Broad Street and High Street travel to
 Newtown from Welshpool,Shrewsbury,    
 Oswestry and Liverpool.The stall      
 holders are ready to commence business
 at approxinately 8.30 a.m.Trading     
 ceases between 4.30 and 5.00.When we  
 undertook the survey there were eighty
 five stalls in the Market.They        
 included boots and shoes,electrical   
 goods,clothing,household goods,fresh  
 fruit and vegetables,toys,gardening   
 equipment,plants,bicycles,crockery,   
 oriental goods,books,fish meat,dairy  
 produce,antiquies.                    </content>
