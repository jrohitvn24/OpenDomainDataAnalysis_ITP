		<title>12GLADESTRY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was built in 1877. The land
 was given by Lord Ormathwaite to build
 a school for the children of the      
 labouring classes. There was one large
 room, divided by a curtain. The       
 toilets were outside. The children    
 went to school from 5 to 14 years old.
 Some children went to the Grammar     
 School when they were 11. There is a  
 new infant room now, and a new        
 kitchen, library, and toilets. The old
 porch is the headteacher's office. Now
 there are 12 children using the big   
 room, once used for 60 children. Now  
 there are electric radiators instead  
 of coal fires. There are carpets,     
 wall-boards, some new furniture, and a
 computer. Children now start school at
 the age of 4, and at 11 they go to    
 John Beddoes School at Presteigne.    
 There are 27 children in school, and a
 lot of young ones to come.            </content>
