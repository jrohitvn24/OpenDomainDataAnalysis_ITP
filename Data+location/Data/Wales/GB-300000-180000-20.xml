		<title>20Transport in Pontyclun</title>
		<content> Pontyclun owes its existence to the   
 railways.In earlier years the only    
 local settlement of note was          
 Llantrisant.Then in 1850 the South    
 Wales Railway was built with the line 
 between Cardiff and Swansea passing   
 through the district.In 1860 the Ely  
 Valley Railway was built linking      
 Llantrisant station,Pontyclun,to the  
 Rhondda and Ely Valleys.This led to   
 the development of a settlement       
 around the railway,with homes and     
 amenities being provided for workers  
 on the railway, and to the growth of  
 industry.In later years branch lines  
 were built to Pontypridd and          
 Cowbridge.All these branch lines are  
 now closed,although the main London - 
 Fishguard line still passes through   
 the village.Modern roads have replaced
 them,including more recently the M4   
 motorway.                             </content>
