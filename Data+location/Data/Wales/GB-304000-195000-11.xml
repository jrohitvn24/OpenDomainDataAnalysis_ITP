		<title>11Penrikyber Colliery</title>
		<content> The most important employer in        
 Penrhiwceiber is the colliery.We were 
 lucky enough to visit it.When we went 
 we went into the offices and asked the
 pit manager some questions.We then    
 went to the storeroom and were fitted 
 with helmets.We saw the winding gear  
 where they haul men,coal and supplies 
 to and from the pit bottom.After that 
 we went to the explosives house.The   
 man there showed us different         
 explosives and detonaters.At the head 
 of the pit we had to go into an       
 airlock,which was used for ventilation
 and we saw some miners finishing their
 shift.When the airlock door slammed it
 nearly shattered my ear drums.We had a
 very interesting day.
