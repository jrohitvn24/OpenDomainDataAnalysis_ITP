 THE DEPOT WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1939. IT 
 IS NOW CLEARLY SIGNPOSTED ON THE A40  
 ROAD.                                 
 IT WAS DEVELOPED AS AN AMMUNITION     
 DEPOT AND REMAINS AS SUCH. ITS        
 PROXIMITY TO A DEEP HARBOUR AT MILFORD
 HAVEN BEING A MAJOR FACTOR, AS WELL AS
 THE SUITABILITY OF THE CHALK IN THE   
 HILLS.                                
 THE DEPOT ALSO NOW HOUSES THE PROPERTY
 SERVICES AGENCY.                      
 IT IS THE MAJOR EMPLOYER IN THE AREA, 
 AND SOME 300 MEN WORK THERE.          
 THE DEPOT EXTENDS FOR FOUR MILES UP   
 THE VALLEY INTO THE GWAUN VALLEY, AND 
 HAS A PERIMETER OF SOME 8 MILES. MUCH 
 OF IT IS SHROUDED BY TREES, BUT       
 REMAINS EASILY ENTERED.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
