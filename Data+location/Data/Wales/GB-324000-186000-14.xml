		<content>There are 8 places of worship in the   
area.The oldest is St.Basil's Church in
Wales in Bassaleg,on a site which      
predates Norman times.St.John's in     
Rogerstone is a daughter church in the 
same parish.The Bethesda Baptist       
Church,Rogerstone has a flourishing    
membership with a large youth section  
of about 50 members.It was first built 
in 1744,but has been rebuilt and       
enlarged since then.In the early 19th  
century it helped to found the Bethel  
Baptist Church in Bassaleg. Bethel has 
an outside baptistry,of which there are
only 3 examples in Gwent.The Wesleyan  
Methodist Church on the road between   
Rhiwderin and Bassaleg was celebrating 
its centenary year in 1970.There is a  
new Methodist Church just outside our  
area,in Glasllwch Lane.
