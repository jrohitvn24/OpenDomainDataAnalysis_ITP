		<title>11THE FARMING YEAR</title>
		<content>{SPRING:}In the spring the farmers let 
 out most of their stock to graze the  
 grass.On some farms nearly all the    
 cows calve in the spring but on others
 they calve all the year round.        
{SUMMER:}In the summer the farmers have
 all their sheep out.In early June the 
 farmer makes his first crop of silage 
 and a little later he does his        
 haymaking.A second cut of silage is   
 taken later still,after fertilizer has
 been applied to the grass fields.Most 
 of the sheep farmers dip and drench   
 their sheep to protect them from fies.
 A lot of cattle farmers spray and fly 
 tag their cattle.                     
{AUTUMN:}In early Autumn the corn is   
 harvested and when it gets wet and    
 cold the cows are housed in Cubicle   
 houses and fed on silage and          
 hay.Winter corn is planted. {
