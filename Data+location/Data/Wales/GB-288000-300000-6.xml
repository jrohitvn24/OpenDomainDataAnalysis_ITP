		<title>06EDUCATION TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I arrive at school at twenty-five to  
 nine.The bell rings at ten past nine. 
 The children go to their classrooms.  
 First Mr.Jones our teacher marks the  
 register.We then  have a school       
 assembly.We sing hymns,read a story   
 and pray.We then all go back into our 
 classrooms.Then we start our sums out 
 of our text books or from the         
 blackboard.Having finished our sums   
 the bell rings for playtime at half   
 past ten.When we come in we do our    
 English or Welsh.At twelve o'clock we 
 have lunch.School starts at one       
 o'clock.We have radio and television  
 programmes ,music,pottery,painting,   
 woodwork and sewing.We have a ten     
 minute break in the afternoon.We      
 usually finish the day with a game    
 outside or in the hall depending on   
 the weather.
