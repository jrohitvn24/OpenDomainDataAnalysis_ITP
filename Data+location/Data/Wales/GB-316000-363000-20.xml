		<title>20The Cilcain/Pantymwyn Shows</title>
		<content> The major local events are the annual 
 village shows, held each summer. The  
 Cilcain Show has been held in its     
 present form since 1954, and this year
 activities included a dog-show and    
 competitions for home-made wine, cake-
 making, gardening, flower-arranging,  
 arts and crafts, and photography. A   
 major attraction is the Mountain Race,
 from the village  to the Jubilee Tower
 on the summit of Moel Fammau and back,
 a distance of about 6km which good    
 runners complete in under 30 minutes. 
 The Pantymwyn Show features a horse-  
 show and gymkhana, with many classes  
 of competitions, in addition to many  
 other activities. The growing interest
 in running in recent years led to the 
 establishment of the 'Leete Race' in  
 1980, and in 1984 a shorter 'Rocks    
 Race' was introduced, which children  
 are allowed to enter.                 </content>
