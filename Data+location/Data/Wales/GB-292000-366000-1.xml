		<title>01THE QUIET HILLS OF CLWYD</title>
		<content>  There has probably been very little  
 change in this area since the original
 Domesday Book, it is very rural with  
 only one small community - Bryn       
 Rhyd Yr Arian. One main road disects  
 the block from north to south but     
 mostly there are single track roads   
 linking the farms. The south east     
 corner is cut by the Afon (river) Aled
 the B5382 road runs paralell to this. 
 It is a fairly hilly area varying     
 between 15m-361m. Almost the entire   
 block is devoted to grazing with many,
 but small, farms. There is electricity
 in the area (but no gas sypply) and a 
 bus service otherwise the area has no 
 amenities at all (sorry - one chapel!)
 The small areas of woodland are very  
 attractive and views from the many    
 vantage points are very pleasant.     
 Hopefully, it will remain as peaceful 
 until the next Domesday Survey!       </content>
