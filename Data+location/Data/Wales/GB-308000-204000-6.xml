 My name is Linzee Gittoes.I live at 36
 Glan y Nant with my mother and father 
 and brother Julian.When I get up on   
 Saturday I open the blinds in my      
 bedroom,I dress,go downstairs and boil
 the kettle.I put the television on at 
 8.30 a.m.to watch Wide Awake Club. I  
 have my breakfast and at 10 a.m.I     
 watch No 73.It is my favourite        
 programme.If I do not watch television
 I go to Bargoed on the 9.40 a.m.bus.  
 When we have bought all our shopping, 
 we get on the 11.30 bus to go home.   
 After dinner at 1.30 p.m.I wash the   
 dishes and my mother dries them.At    
 2.30 p.m. my Nan takes me to see my   
 other Nan in Rhymney.She lives on her 
 own because my Grandpa died 4 years   
 ago.When we come home from Rhymney we 
 watch the television.
