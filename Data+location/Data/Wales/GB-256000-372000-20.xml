		<title>20Port Penrhyn</title>
		<content> Built by Lord Penrhyn,owner of the    
 Penrhyn Slate Quarries at Bethesda    
 some ten miles away,at the beginning  
 of the 19th century,it is a small port
 built to accomodate the sailing ships 
 of the time.They transported slates to
 many parts of the world.During the    
 latter half of the century a narrow   
 guage railway line was built from the 
 quarry to the port and a network of   
 lines covered the port itself.These   
 linked up with the main railway and   
 gradually killed off sea trade. With  
 the final closure of the port for     
 slate transportation the rails were   
 removed during the late 1950's.       
 The port is now used by small trawlers
 and by occasional coasters bringing   
 building sand or taking away slate    
 dust for construction purposes.
