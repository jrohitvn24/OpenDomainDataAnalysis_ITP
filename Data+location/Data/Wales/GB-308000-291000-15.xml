		<title>15Town Councillor</title>
		<content> Our local Councillor visited our      
 school to tell us about her work.She  
 became a councillor because she liked 
 talking about local affairs.She did   
 not work every day but only on demand.
 She attends about 2 or 3 meetings a   
 week and her duties as town councillor
 are to look after the interest and    
 properties of people in Newtown. She  
 has been elected Mayor twice in 1977  
 and 1978. In fact,she was the town's  
 first lady Mayor. Most of the         
 complaints she receives are about     
 housing and some complaints are passed
 on to the District Council. She told  
 us that the rates would remain the    
 same this year at 3p in the Â£.The     
 council room is called 'The Chamber'  
 and there are 16 councillors and a    
 clerk.
