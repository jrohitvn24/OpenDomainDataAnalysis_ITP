		<content> On Monday morning June 17th we went to
 see the Chairman of the County Council
 and it was in Newport Road.When we got
 there we parked the mini buses and we 
 got out and we had to line up,one     
 line with boys and the other line with
 girls.After we had lined up we went in
 to the building it was a big building.
 We went in this room and it was full  
 of chairs and the Chairmans chair was 
 there.Brett Hanlon sat in the         
 Chairmans chair and we were asking    
 questions and after that we went up   
 to the eleventh floor.We went up by   
 lift it only  took about one minute.  
 After we went up we had a little tea  
 party because Miss Gill was leaving.  
 After we had the tea party we had to  
 go and before we went he gave us a    
 card and said good_bye and we went    
 back to school.
