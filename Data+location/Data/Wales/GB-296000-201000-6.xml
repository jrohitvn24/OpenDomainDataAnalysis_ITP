		<title>06Aberdare By_Pass System</title>
		<content> The by_pass was built because the old 
 road could not cope with the transport
 problems of the area.Work started in  
 1982.Permission was granted by the    
 Welsh Office and Mid_Glamorgan Road   
 and Highways Department.It was partly 
 financed by the European Development  
 Fund.                                 
    The road has caused a lot of       
 controversey because many of the      
 previously quiet side streets such as 
 Trefelin and Harriet and Meirion      
 Street are now very busy and very     
 noisy because the heavy traffic travel
 along them to gain access to the      
 by_pass.                              
    We interviewed a resident of       
 Meirion St. about the noise,fumes and 
 congestions.                          
    He thought the new road was a good 
 idea but it left a lot to be desired  
 because there is more noise now.      </content>
