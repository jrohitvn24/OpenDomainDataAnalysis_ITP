		<content> Because of the lower altitude, greater
 shelter from winds and gentler slopes,
 sheep farming here gives way to mixed 
 farming, usually combining stock rear 
 -ing with a small amount of arable,   
 mainly to provide winter feed for the 
 animals. There are several milking    
 herds here.  Despite the altitude and 
 comparatively boisterous climate,there
 have been recent attempts to diversify
 into such activities as soft-fruit    
 growing.Two farms have offered        
 pick-your-own strawberries during the 
 last few years, but it remains to be  
 seen whether these ventures have      
 survived the cool,wet summer of 1985.
