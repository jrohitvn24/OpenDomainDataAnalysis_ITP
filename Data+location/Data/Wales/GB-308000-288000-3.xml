		<content> June 24,1985.Today we went to         
 interview Mrs.Bernice Roberts,who,50  
 years ago ran two miles to warn the   
 Newtown signal box that a tree swept  
 down the Mochdre river by flood had   
 made the Scafell bridge               
 dangerous.Mrs.Roberts was a national  
 heroine after her brave deed.Today the
 river Severn and its tributaries are  
 in flood less often because of the    
 Clywedog dam in the hills and work    
 done on strengthening the river banks 
 and lowering the bed.Before this      
 floods were a great nuisance;furniture
 and carpets were ruined,and farmland  
 covered with water for weeks.
