		<content> The vicar has been a priest for 31    
 years and he gets up at 7 o clock     
 every morning.After saying morning    
 prayers he goes to the hospital where 
 he is the chaplin.The Vicar spends    
 most of his time in the hospital      
 visiting the sick and talking and     
 helping the patients and their        
 relations. He spends most of his day  
 in their homes. He also has other jobs
 to do in the church taking weddings   
 and funerals . He has more funerals   
 than weddings and he also has a few   
 chrisinings.                          
 When he has finished his work he likes
 to relax by listening to music and    
 spending some time with his wife and  
 family. The vicer could not do his    
 work without his car because he has to
 travel a lot. He lives in the vicarage
 next to the church and says he likes  
 his job very much.                    </content>
