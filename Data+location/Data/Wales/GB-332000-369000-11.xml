		<title>11The Sealand Festival</title>
		<content> I went to Sealand Festival last year  
 and I was on the white elephant stall 
 with one of my friends,there were cake
 stalls,plant stalls,there was a stall 
 where you had to pick a ticket and if 
 it had a nought on the end you would  
 have won something.There were book    
 stalls.There were games like roll a   
 penny,treasure hunt,throwing wet      
 sponges in each other's faces,throwing
 the welly.There were boys playing     
 football at the far end of the field  
 and there was an obstacle race.There  
 were different competitions,there was 
 the best dressed bike organised by    
 Sealand P.T.A..There was a fancy dress
 organised by St.Andrew's Church,the   
 glamorous granny competition organised
 by one of the churches in Garden City,
 the knobbly knees competion organised 
 by the youth club and there was bingo.
