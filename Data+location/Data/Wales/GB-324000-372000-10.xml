		<title>10Market day in Flint</title>
		<content> According to local history, the{first 
{market}held in Flint was granted by   
 King Edward 1 in{1279}and was held    
 each Thursday. The market flourished  
 well until the{second world war.}In   
{1956}the town council decided to bring
 back the market. The same council now 
 runs a{successful and friendly}       
 open-air market each Friday in the    
 town square.                          
 There are dozens of stalls{selling a  
{variety of goods from fish, fruit to  
{clothes and carpets.}Some traders are 
 local but others come from Liverpool  
 and Manchester.                       
 During our class visit we interviewed 
 my neighbour Mrs. Probert who was     
 selling fresh fish. She explained that
 the{rent depended on the length of the
{frontage}of each stall. We also met a 
 few boys who had left the secondary   
 school, most of them were unemployed. </content>
