		<content> Beautiful open hill country, wooded   
 hill-sides and some arable land       
 sloping down to River Conwy. It is    
 well drained by many streams and River
 Ro. Many traces of early civilisations
 can be seen: dry-stone walls indicate 
 early farming settlements. The main   
 industry is hill farming. Steep narrow
 roads and high hedges make transport  
 difficult. Good starting point for    
 hikers to walk peaks of Snowdon range.
 Holidaymakers come to enjoy the peace 
 and quiet; many return to settle      
 permanently. Some derelict farmhouses 
 mar the countryside. Signs of 20th    
 century technology are electricity    
 pylons, corrugated animal sheds and a 
 few new houses. A scattered community 
 where Welsh is spoken widely. It      
 relies on the amenities provided at   
 the villages of Rowen and Llanbedr    
 as part of each is within this area.  </content>
