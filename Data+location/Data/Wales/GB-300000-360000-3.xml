		<title>03NANTGLYN VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>    The oldest housing is seen at the  
 crossroads.Many cottages are 200 years
 old, with slate floors, beam ceilings 
 and inglenook fireplaces. One is dated
 1769,with the initials WRM, another   
 is the old Smithy.                    
    The site of the village is much    
 older and many of the houses include  
 the name llan(enclosure by a church). 
 Penllan was once a pub. called the    
 Victoria Inn, and Tyn y Llan was once 
 a shop.There were 3 public houses     
 serving the drovers on their way to   
 Denbigh.                              
    Two of the old houses in the       
 village are "second homes". Two others
 are on sale having been bought by     
 outsiders. The attitude of some local 
 people is against such purchases. They
 feel it raises the price too high for 
 local buyers, and that it threatens   
 the Welsh Lifestyle.                  </content>
