		<title>09A day in the life of........</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30 and usually have     
 Special K for breakfast.While my mum  
 ties my hairs I watch T.V.a.m.I try to
{get to school early so I can be in the
 early morning computer club.          
  After assembly we do basic work.At   
 playtime I help with the crisps and   
{then we play British Bulldog.In this  
 game one player stands in the middle  
 of the playground and the others have 
 to run past without being ticked.     
  In the afternoon we have more basic  
 work and Welsh with the travelling    
 teacher.Afterwards I have craft which 
 I enjoy very much.                    
  After school I go to Emma's to play. 
 We put on the loud music because her  
 mum and dad are at work.We dance to   
 Wham but we look through the curtains 
 in case they come home early.I go to  
 bed about 9.30.
