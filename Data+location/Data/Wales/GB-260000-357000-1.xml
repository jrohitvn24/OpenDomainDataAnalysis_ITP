		<title>01Y Garn &amp; the Llanberis Pass</title>
		<content> This area consists of a mountainous   
 region disected from SE to NW by a    
 deep valley known as the Llanberis    
 Pass. The North Eastern region s the  
 mountain Y Garn which rises to 947    
 metres. From 400 metres on the open   
 moorland, grazing for sheep is carried
 out. Below this level, fences &amp; walls 
 contain farm stock. The hamlet, Nant  
 Peris lies in the valley. There are 2 
 campsites here and some simple tourist
 accommodation. The road which passes  
 through the valley keeps close to the 
 side of the mountain avoiding the     
 flooding river. It is a major road    
 from Caernarfon to England &amp; is       
 frequented by many touring coaches and
 holiday makers during the summer      
 months.
