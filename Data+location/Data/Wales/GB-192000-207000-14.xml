		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JASON 1</title>
		<content>  I get up by my watch alarm which I   
 set at half past seven.I come down    
 stairs  and have my breakfast.I eat a 
 cereal called shreddies.After I get   
 dressed and wash and clean my teeth,I 
 go to call for my friend.Some times I 
 meet him by the lane.We walk up to    
 school.We usually get to school at    
 about five to nine.School starts at   
 nine fifteen so until then we stay out
 in the play ground.When we go in we   
 have a service.Afterwards we do diary 
 but that is only on Monday.Otherwise  
 we do Maths.,English,Sheets or        
 Reading.On Monday we go to Neyland    
 Pool for Swimming lessons.            
  We go for dinner at twelve o'clock in
 the Village Hall.We go home at        
 three thirty.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
