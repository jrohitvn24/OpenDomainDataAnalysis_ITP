		<title>16Poaching in Llangeitho area</title>
		<content> There is a tradition of poaching in   
 the area but this is not so true      
 nowadays. Before myxomatosis decimated
 the rabbit population, the local      
 farmers invited professional trappers 
 to visit their farms. The farmer would
 share the money received for the      
 trapped rabbits. As there are now very
 few rabbits, there are no professional
 trappers and also very little         
 poaching.                             
 There is still some poaching for      
 salmon and sea-trout in the autumn    
 when they are spawning in the River   
 Aeron. They are taken by using a torch
 and gaff at night. However, due to the
 heavy fines imposed for this offence, 
 this is also decreasing. There is     
 little feathered game in the area,    
 although pheasants are increasing due 
 to breeding and releasing. The grey   
 partridge is unfortunately extinct.   </content>
