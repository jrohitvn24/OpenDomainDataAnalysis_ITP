		<title>13Local History LISVANE</title>
		<content>{Rural Past: }At the beginning of the  
 century, the area was wholly rural    
 with farms along the spring line.The  
 characteristic hedge had a small round
 hollybush above the regular hedge     
 line.Holly still flourishes in the    
 area.Caerphilly cheese was made on the
 local farms and taken to the autumn   
 cheese market.Samples of the school   
 register for 1914-19 show 50% of      
 parents engaged in farming.           
{Suburbanisation:}1900 to the First    
 World War big houses were built for   
 shipping families.At the end of that  
 war there were 35 houses in Lisvane.  
 Now the are 500.From 1963 land was    
 developed for housing.Lisvane rapidly 
 became a dormitory suburb of Cardiff. 
 Local changes: Cefn Onn Stores, a vast
 railway siding during the coal boom,  
 became a naval stores during the II   
 World War now used by Wales Gas.      </content>
