 27/64. It stands on a site  dated pre-
 1630.  The mansion has two Renaissance
 sides which were refaced in the second
 half of the 18th cent.Originally built
 for the  Gwynne family,  it later came
 into the ownership of the Peel family,
 close relatives of the  statesman  Sir
 Robert Peel.  Although currently owned
 by Mr.&amp; Mrs.John Spencer Williams, the
 Dower Cottage remains the  property of
 the Peel family.   The interior of the
 house contains elaborate plaster work,
 pine panelling,   a beautiful Jacobean
 'dog-leg' staircase,and some fine 17th
 century wall and ceiling  paintings of
 Italian influence. In the courtyard is
 a cockpit, and a Georgian cottage wing
 now converted into flats.   The estate
 retains  little of its  original  Park
 except for the immediate outbuildings,
 lawns, and the walled gardens .       </content>
