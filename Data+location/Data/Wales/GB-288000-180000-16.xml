		<title>16PENYFAI VILLAGE BRIDGEND</title>
		<content>  Most of the village of Penyfai       
 belonged to the Court Coleman Estate. 
 Colonel Llewellyn's family lived in   
 Court Coleman House from 1837.In 1960 
 he sold the house and built a smaller 
 one,White Hall,behind the church.The  
 old manor house is now The Court      
 Coleman Hotel.Penyfai Welsh Baptist   
 Chapel was built in 1793 and is the   
 oldest in Wales.When the Tavern was   
 closed the Pheasant became the Village
 Pub.It was converted from a 15th      
 century farm house.Behind the farm    
 house was a quarry which provided     
 stone for the village houses.         
  All Saints Church was built of local 
 stone and donated by R.W.Llewellyn in 
 1903.It is quite small.In 1899 Mr.    
 Llewellyn built a church school,one   
 room for juniors and one room for     
 infants.In 1962 it was closed and a   
 modern one opened.                    </content>
