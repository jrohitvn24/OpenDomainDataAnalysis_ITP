		<title>01Heolgerrig D Block.</title>
		<content>   The main built up area in the block 
 is around Heolgerrig,Winchfawr and    
 Swansea Road.Heolgerrig is an old     
 village which has had new houses built
 on to it.The people who live there are
 mostly middle class.                  
   A lot of the land in the block is   
 used for growing conifers.The rest is 
 rough grass which is not good for     
 farming and has been undermined.      
   The main industry is Thorns Lighting
 Factory,a small clothing              
 factory,brickworks and an open cast   
 coal mine on the other side of the    
 Aberdare mountain.                    
   There are not any important         
 buildings in the block or any very old
 ones.                                 
   The river which runs through the    
 North East corner of the block is the 
 River Taff.
