		<content> Before the year 1922, the main road   
 was a small street called Gun Street, 
 now the main road is the main Chester 
 to Wrexham road.  There were no street
 lights until 1939 but they were not   
 actually lit until 1945 because of the
 war.                                  
                                       
 Trevalyn Manor during the war was used
 by the army and after the war it was  
 used as a nursing home.  Today it is  
 the Trevalyn Hospital for elderly     
 people.                               
                                       
 The Primary School was opened in April
 1950.  It was built on a field which  
 the villagers used to call the carrot 
 field.
