 Q.What was Newbridge like in 1925?    
     The Newbridge area consisted of   
 mainly terraced houses which were     
 built for the miners families (who    
 worked privately owned mines).Most    
 houses consisted of two               
 families,because there were not       
 sufficient houses available.The area  
 had a railway,poor roads,two colleries
 where most of the men in the area     
 worked,and a canal system which was   
 used for transporting coal from the   
 colliery to Newport.Most of the       
 families were very large in number    
 and very poor financially and many    
 children died young due to poverty and
 diseases.
