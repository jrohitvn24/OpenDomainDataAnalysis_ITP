		<content> Penboyr Primary School is a Voluntary 
 Aided School of the Church in Wales.It
 was opened on July 6th 1866 when      
 thirty pupils were registered during  
 the first week. It was built on a plot
 of land adjoining St. Barnabas Church 
 on the banks of the river Esgair. At  
 first it was a small school but owing 
 to the expansion of the woollen       
 industry in the locality in the latter
 part of the last century it had to be 
 extended and additions were built in  
 1873 and 1895. At present there are   
 102 pupils on roll. It is staffed by  
 four permanent teachers, including the
 headteacher, and two peripatetic      
 teachers in music and remedial        
 education. The main language of the   
 school is Welsh but as it serves a    
 Welsh and English community most of   
 the teaching is bilingual. The aim is 
 to make all pupils bilingual.{A.Davies</content>
