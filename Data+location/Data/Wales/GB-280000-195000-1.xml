		<title>01THE BLOCK AS A WHOLE</title>
		<content>{NOTE The survey work undertaken for   
{the Domesday Project was confined to a
{2 by 4 kilometre block: we started at 
{the correct south west corner but were
{unable to do any work on the          
{northernmost 1 by 4 km strip.         
                                       
 This area is characterised by high    
 rounded hills, most of which are      
 covered by conifers owned by the      
 Forestry Commission. The rest of the  
 land is given to farming: mainly sheep
 but with some cattle too.             
 Geologically the land is sand-stone   
 coal measures.                        
  There are three villages inside the  
 block: {TONMAWR}in the Pelenna Valley 
 and the twin villages of{CYNNONVILLE} 
 and{DYFFRYN RHONDDA}which are in the  
 Afan Valley.
