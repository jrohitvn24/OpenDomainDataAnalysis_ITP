		<title>13GOFFEEE THE CLOWN,LYDART</title>
		<content> I am a clown,The Great Goffeee (red   
 nose and big feet),alias Harry le Goff
 (white nose and no money),alias Prof. 
 Goffeee (the Punch &amp; Judy man).       
 I was originally trained as an artist 
 and my paintings of circus and        
 fair-ground life eventually led me to 
 performing.                           
 I started as a clown in Gerry Cottle's
 Circus in l976.I moved to the Monmouth
 area in 1977,and now live in a small  
 cottage with my wife,the painter Sarah
 Allpress,and our two children.        
 Since 1976 I have had my own shows    
 ranging from Punch and Judy and clown 
 shows on Tenby beach,to shows touring 
 rural communities.                    
 I now have my own small circus seating
 250 in a little Big Top - Circus Dda. 
 It is a new style circus combining    
 good clowning and circus skills with  
 experimental theatre and music.       </content>
