		<content>  Many years ago, Killay was known as  
 Goetre, which means "pasture land".   
 Along the high ground above Clyne     
 Valley were very old farms which gave 
 their names to the village:Goetre     
 Fawr,Goetre Fach and Goetre Bellaf.   
 Where shops,houses and pubs are now   
 were fields,woods and streams and only
 a few scattered houses, which were    
 probably small-holdings.Lower Killay  
 came into being with the construction 
 of the London &amp; North Western Railway 
 in the mid-19th century. In 1877 a    
 school was built for the children of  
 Dunvant village and the few who lived 
 in Killay.People moved into           
 the district because of the brickworks
 and coalmines, the last of the latter 
 closing between the wars. Since then, 
 the area has developed as a suburb of 
 Swansea.
