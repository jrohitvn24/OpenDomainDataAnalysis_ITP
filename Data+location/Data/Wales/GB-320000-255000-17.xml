		<title>17BRECON AND RADNOR ELECTION</title>
		<content> On July 4th 1985 we had a bye-election
 in our area. This was because of the  
 death of Mr Tom Hoason. There are     
 seven people who want to be our MP. Mr
 Richard Livesy in standing for        
 Liberal/ SDP Alliance. Mr Chris Butler
 is  standing for the Conservatives, Dr
 Richard Willy for Labour. Mrs Janet   
 Davies is the candidate for Plaid     
 Cymru, which wants Wales to be a      
 separate country.                     
 Lord Edward Sutch is standing for the 
 Monster Raving Loony Party. There are 
 two other candidates. People over     
 eighteen can vote for one person. They
 go to vote in the Village Hall. All   
 the votes are taken to Brecon to      
 counted.                              
 Livsey had 13793 votes, Willey 13194, 
 Butler 10631, Davies 435, Sutch 202,  
 others 197. So our new MP is Liberal, 
 not Conservative as before.           </content>
