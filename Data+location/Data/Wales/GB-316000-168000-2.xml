		<content>  At 7.30,I get up,shower,and at once I
 feel better.I read my book,mum shouts,
 I'm late for breakfast.At the table I 
 join in the argument.Breakfast has    
 always been cereal and jam on toast   
 since I was five.I brush my hair,clean
 my teeth and I'm ready."Oh no!my lunch
 bag and pencil case."At school a bell 
 rings,9.00,a reading lesson begins.We 
 have Maths and English in the morning.
 At 10.00 is school assembly,we see a  
 play by Class 8 on Rules in Sport.We  
 play Fireball at break,passing a ball,
 if it's dropped we run around.Thank   
 goodness,we missed Welsh today!After  
 lunch,we walk to Cosmeston and study a
 hedgerow.Back in school,half the class
 play rounders,others practice sports. 
 3.25,only 5 minutes to the bell.Tea is
 pizza and garlic bread,after washing  
 dishes,I go swimming.Then watch TV or 
 play on my computer in my blue bedroom</content>
