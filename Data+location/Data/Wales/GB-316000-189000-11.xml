 the area. For adults there are two    
 licensed clubs,one pub and a football 
 pitch.Children's facilities include a 
 small playground for young children,  
 mini rugby and soccer pitches,and a   
 small BMX cycle area.There is plenty  
 of common and woodland around the     
 village.The local fishing club have   
 stocked the River Sirhowy with trout. 
   68% of the adults regularly make use
 of the clubs and pub.Because of the   
 limited leisure facilities 39% of the 
 children play games to do with sport. 
 The most popular being football and   
 rounders.                             
   22% of the children enjoy cycling   
 around the village and lanes or using 
 the BMX track.Only 4% of those inter-
