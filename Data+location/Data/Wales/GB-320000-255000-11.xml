		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> In the past the people are mostly     
 farmers or have worked on farms or    
 rented farms from Lord Ormethwaite who
 owned the estate.                     
 Today there are 21 families in our    
 school and 9 of them are farmers and  
 12 have other jobs 43% are farmers and
 57% have other jobs so really theres  
 more people with other jobs lots of   
 people have come to the village to    
 live and aren't farmers. One policeman
 who lives in Gladestry who works in   
 London which is 780 miles away. There 
 is an accountant who works in         
 Hay-on-Wye. There are builders who are
 mostly self-employed. There are people
 who have retired who mostly came from 
 outside Gladestry. Of the 51 people we
 counted only 19(37%) are retired and  
 32 (62%) are working.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
