		<content>    Recollections of a retired person. 
 As a boy, I lived in Pontlottyn with  
 my family.My father had a shop, but   
 became a commercial traveller selling 
 paraffin lamps. He cycled as far as   
 Pembrokeshire selling them.Electricity
 came, and he worked for a paper bag   
 firm.He supplied women with paper and 
 glue and paid them 1 s for 1000 bags. 
 During the 1926 Strike I collected    
 coal from the tips with my brothers   
 and sisters.I would carry the first   
 bag half-way home and leave my sister 
 to mind it while I went back for the  
 next.My mother said that this walk    
 back was my "spell".It took me 4hrs to
 get the coal home. Once I saved 3d and
 walked to see Merthyr play football.I 
 spent 1d to get in,1d on tram fare to 
 Dowlais and 1d on chips before walking
 4 miles home.I later became a school- 
 teacher and later still Headmaster.   </content>
