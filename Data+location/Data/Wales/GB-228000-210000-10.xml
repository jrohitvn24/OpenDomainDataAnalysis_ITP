		<title>10TO AND FROM LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> Many children attend school by bus and
 many people use the bus to go to work 
 and shop in Carmarthen.  Regular coach
 trips are made to places of interest  
 at reasonable prices.  Cars are the   
 main form of transport for all pur-   
 poses, some families owning 2 or more.
 Railway branch line at Whitland (7    
 miles) and main line at Carmarthen (15
 miles).  Carmarthen-London takes about
 4 hours, the return fare being from   
 Â£17 (special times) to Â£40 (ordinary).
 Fast long-distance coaches from       
 St Clears and Carmarthen. Dylan Thomas
 lived in Laugharne for a few years and
 is buried here. Due to his writings,  
 especially his radio play "Under Milk 
 Wood", the media have taken a special 
 interest in Laugharne. Writers Richard
 Hughes, Charles Morgan, Hilda Vaughan 
 also lived here.
