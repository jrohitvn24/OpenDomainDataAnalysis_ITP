		<content> The only major industry in the aea is 
 Tunnel Cement of Padeswood.It is      
 situated about 8 miles west of Chester
 and 1 mile south east of Buckley.It   
 was the first cement manufacturing    
 works to be built in the U.K. after   
 world war 2.The basic raw materials   
 for the production of cement at       
 Padeswood are limestone which comes   
 from Cefn Mawr to the west of Mold.   
 The shale comes from the waste tips of
 Llay main colliery, 7 miles south of  
 Padeswood.they also get water from    
 Kinnerton.Sand is available locally   
 and gypsum is found under the Cheshire
 Plain to the east.Presently the       
 company employs about 600 people.Some 
 of the raw materials arrive by        
 rail,others by road and much of the   
 cement leaves this way.Tipper trucks  
 are used for this.
