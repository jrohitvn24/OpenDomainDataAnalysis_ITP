		<title>11Margam Park Orangery Gardens</title>
		<content> These formal gardens cover an area of 
 27 acres.  The Broad Walk leading from
 the castle is noted for its rhododend-
 rons as is Fishpond.  The bamboo      
 garden is largely overgrown.  Notable 
 specimen trees include a Wellingtonia,
 37m, a fine fern leaved Beech 18x20m, 
 Oriental Plane, 3 Tulip Trees, and in 
 front of the Orangery 2 ancient Stone 
 Pines and an Aleppo Pine.             
 Trees and shrubs with dark green      
 foliage predominate in the lower      
 garden where the orange trees were    
 stood out in summer months.  Here a   
 fantasy village is being constructed  
 depicting houses and characters from  
 Folk tales and Nursery rhymes.  A     
 pergola 450 metres long is being built
 clothed with climbing plants of every 
 description.
