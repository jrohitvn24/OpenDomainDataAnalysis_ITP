{Adrian Woolley 1A                     
                                       
   A normal day in my house starts at  
 8.00am when I wake up. The first thing
 I do is get dressed; into a blue      
 shirt, black jumper, maroon tie and   
 black trousers. I wear these clothes  
 because they are my school uniform. I 
 have my breakfast at 8.05am - a cup of
 coffee and some biscuits.             
   Then I feed my rabbit, he is white  
 with black ears, his name is Starsky. 
 I give him some water and Bunny Mix   
 (Wheat, Oats and Sunflower seeds), I  
 am very fond of him.                  
   I have a wash with Zest soap and    
 clean my teeth with Colgate           
 toothpaste.                           
 I leave my house at 8.25am and call   
 for my friend Justin, together we walk
 to Blacon High School.                </content>
