		<title>06EDUCATION - COITY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   In the year l876 a group decided    
 that a school should be built in      
 Coity. It was built of stone which was
 quarried near by and it consisted of  
 four rooms. One of the rooms was      
 actually the headmasters house. Two of
 the rooms could be opened into a large
 room. All children up to 7 years of   
 age were in one classroom, up to ll   
 years old in another, the top class   
 had children until they left at l4.   
 In l898 a school house was built and  
 the headmasters old house became a    
 classroom. The rooms were heated by   
 large open fires. The toilets were out
 in the yard. In l966 a new block of 2 
 classrooms was built in the field for 
 the Infants, then in l97l a new hall, 
 kitchen, staffroom and children's     
 toilets were added to the school.
