		<content>{SUMMARY OF LAND STUDIED               
 The block of land we are covering west
 of Pontypool, is mainly a{mountainous 
{rural area.                           
                                       
 We have looked at old coal mines,     
 railways that have been discontinued  
 and schools that have been closed.    
                                       
 Our block extends fromthe Sowhill area
 of Pontypool to Blaen-y-cwm near      
 Llanhilleth in the North and from West
 of Sebastopol to Mynydd Llwyd in the  
 South.                                
                                       
 There are some very interesting       
 features in this block, e.g. the      
{Re-Chem Industrial Waste Disposal     
{"dumping  ground" at Tirpentwys. }We  
 will talk of this, later on.          
                                       
                                       </content>
