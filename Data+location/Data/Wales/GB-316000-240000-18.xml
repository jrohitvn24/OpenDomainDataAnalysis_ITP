		<content> Things are changing in our area.      
 Several of the larger old country     
 houses have been bought by English    
 Local Authorities, and are being      
 used as Outdoor Persuit Centres.      
 Ty Carreg, near the school, has been  
 bought by a group of Birmingham       
 business men called "The Stonehouse   
 Gang" who bought the property for     
 deprived Birmingham children.         
 Many small farmhouses have been bought
 as private holiday homes and remain   
 empty all Winter.                     
 The Post Office in Ffynnon Gynydd     
 closed 3 years ago.Only the School    
 remains as a focal communal point;even
 this has been threatened with closure.
 We feel it is vital for the welfare of
 the community, that our School remains
 open for many years to come.
