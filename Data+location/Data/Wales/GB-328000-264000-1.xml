		<title>01Presteigne and Lugg valley</title>
		<content> Presteigne is the old county town of  
 Radnorshire,(Powys after 1974)sited on
 the{English-Welsh border. Offa's Dyke 
 is to the north west.The{River Lugg   
 flows eastwards through the area.Most 
 employment is in{livestock farming,   
 including growth of fodder crops.Tree 
 cover is fairly extensive due to      
 planting of mainly coniferous         
 forest by the{Forestry Commission}and 
 private landowners.The remainder of   
 the population work in the service    
 sector, although many young people    
 have to leave to work in the cities,  
 while senior citizens from those areas
 buy retirement cottages here.B roads  
 link to neighbouring towns,while a    
 by-pass built with{EEC money}skirts   
 the town along the route of the old   
{railway}closed in 1964 for goods      
 traffic and for passengers in 1958.
