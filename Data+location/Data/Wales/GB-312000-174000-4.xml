 talked about many things,he gives     
 advice on housing,roads and           
 parks.After he had talked to us we    
 were allowed to ask him questions,    
 some of us asked him some hard        
 questions and he could not answer any 
 of them,but he tried to answer them.  
 He is the one that helps to give the  
 school money to buy books and         
 equipment.We asked him how many       
 Primary schools there are and he said 
 there are seven Primary schools and   
 he told us how many Secondary schools 
 and there were only two of them in    
 Ely.We could go down Caerau Lane on a 
 Saturday morning and we could talk to 
 him during one and a half hours.He is 
 Councillor for Trelai ward.At eleven  
 o'clock Councillor Currie Jones had   
 to go and we said good_bye to him.    </content>
