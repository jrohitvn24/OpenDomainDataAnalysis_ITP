		<content> From our school we can see the town,  
 the new police station,car park and   
 Old Bridge.We walk under the railway  
 bridge past some big old houses.Some  
 are being turned into flats and one is
 the Education office.The road goes    
 through Old Graigwen to the new       
 estates where most of us live and up  
 to the Georgian houses at the top.The 
 lovely big house,Maes-y-Deri,has just 
 been knocked down and they are        
 building Â£41,000 houses there.One day 
 we walked from our school through the 
 comprehensive school and up through   
 the woods,passing houses on our left. 
 We walked away from the houses to a   
 field of ferns and blackberries where 
 they are building a big new dormer    
 bungalow.We went past the old coal    
 level to the farm.Across the valley we
 saw the A470 Cardiff-Merthyr trunk    
 road.  (From Coed-y-lan school)       </content>
