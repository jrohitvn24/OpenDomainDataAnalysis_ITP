		<content> The population of this area has       
 declined over the years.Families are  
 much smaller now,with an average of   
 two children per family.Years ago     
 families were much bigger.Many        
 children died in infancy so parents   
 had many children to be sure that some
 survived.These children were their    
 insurance against future starvation as
 the welfare state was non existent.No 
 work meant no wages.                  
 This area has many disused mine       
 shafts.These mines employed men,women 
 and children.When these mines closed, 
 the families moved away to find work  
 in the nearby towns,thereby starting  
 the decline in population.
