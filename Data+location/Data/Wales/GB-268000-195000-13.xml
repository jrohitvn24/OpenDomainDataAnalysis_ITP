		<title>13BMX CYCLING</title>
		<content> BMX is a craze of the eighties it     
 takes 2 forms;dirt track racing with  
 jumps,ramps etc.,and freestyle which  
 involves tricks on specially adapted  
 cycles.Falls are common,so special    
 protective clothing is needed.Many    
 professional riders earn thousands of 
 dollars.The cycles have light,strong  
 frames with twenty inch wheels.Parts  
 can be removed or added so that       
 customised bikes can be achieved.BMX  
 is very popular in Swansea and there  
 are a number of tracks.Our local track
 is at Birchgrove.There are race meets 
 every fortnight.The track was built as
 the result of a petition from local   
 riders.It was designed by ourselves   
 and it took 2 months to complete.Many 
 of the races are sponsored by local   
 BMX shops and the sport is really well
 established.
