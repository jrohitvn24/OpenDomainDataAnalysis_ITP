		<title>04Litter In TONYREFAIL</title>
		<content> We carried out a{litter survey}of     
 Tonyrefail asking shopkeepers for     
 their opinion of the litter problem.  
 When we had sorted out what we had    
 learnt from our survey ,this is what  
 we gathered.                          
   They all felt that Tonyrefail was a 
 place that they were dissatisfied     
 with,but did little about it          
 themselves.We all asked different     
 questions and that made it difficult  
 to generalize.We went into a pet shop 
 and a video shop.We asked,"Who do you 
 think causes the litter problem?" The 
 answer was "The public".No shop said  
 that their shop caused litter.They    
 could easily put signs up saying NO   
 LITTER.The pet shop lady has never    
 told any children off for dropping    
 litter,which I think she should have  
 done.
