		<title>03GAMES THAT CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content>  The games that we play in the yard   
 are "British Bulldogs","Kick the Can",
 "Monster Man","Tip","Penny 123",      
 "Space Invaders","Three Chances",     
 "Stuck in the Mud","Hopscotch" and    
 "White Horses". "Ball Tip" is a       
 popular game in my school but "British
 Bulldogs" is the best game. One person
 is chosen to be "on". He stands on a  
 spot and all the other children that  
 play the game stand around. The one   
 chosen chooses a{name}and then that   
 person must reach the chosen spot     
 without being caught. If he's not     
 caught all the other children who play
 must get to the "base" before         
 "Bulldog" returns. If the person whose
 name was called is caught then both   
 must go to "base" and call out another
 name until the whole lot are caught   
 and become "Bulldogs" and the game    
 ends.                                 </content>
