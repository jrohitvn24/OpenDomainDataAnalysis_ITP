		<content> Thoughts from a{Llangennech}senior    
 citizen.                              
 There has been more change in the     
 pattern of living during the last half
 century than in any corresponding     
 period in history. Two world wars     
 hastened the mechanical and technical 
 progress. Prior to the first world war
 the Industrial Revolution had had     
 little impact on the social life of   
 the village.                          
 Railways did exist but stations       
 were generally located on the         
 outskirts of the village and unless   
 they undertook a journey of some      
 distance, people preferred to walk as 
 their fathers had done. To travel by  
 train was considered a luxury. But it 
 was the advent of the car that        
 dramatically changed the pattern of   
 village life.                         
                                       </content>
