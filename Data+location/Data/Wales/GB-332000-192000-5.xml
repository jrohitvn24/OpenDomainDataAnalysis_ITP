 There is a manuscript indicating that 
 English as well as Welsh was used in  
 Zion Ponthir in 1820, and in 1837, the
 sermons were given in both languages, 
 English an Welsh. Welsh sermons were  
 given in the morning, and English     
 sermons in the evening. The church was
 renovated in the year 1901. Under the 
 floor between the pulpit and the wall 
 near the burial ground, is a well of  
 water which was probably used to clean
 the church and baptise people. At the 
 end of station road there is a small  
 shed used as a garage today, but it   
 was a place to keep the pony and trap 
 of visiting ministers.
