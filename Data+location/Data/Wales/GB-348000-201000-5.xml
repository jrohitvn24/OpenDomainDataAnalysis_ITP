		<content> Another type of farming can be seen at
 Whitelye Stud, where they have got ten
 thoroughbred horses which they breed  
 to sell and race.  The horses are fed 
 on oats every morning before they are 
 put out into the paddocks and again   
 when they are brought in at night. The
 brood mares are fed on stud cubes and 
 milk pellets.  Each horse has a       
 separate stable.  In their stable they
 have an infrared lamp to keep the     
 mares warm.  This is necessary as in  
 January and February when the brood   
 mares foal it is very cold.  To know  
 when the horses are foaling there is a
 built-in camera to watch the progress 
 of the birth.  When the foals are     
 weaned, they are prepared for the     
 Ascot sales where they are sold and   
 used for racing.
