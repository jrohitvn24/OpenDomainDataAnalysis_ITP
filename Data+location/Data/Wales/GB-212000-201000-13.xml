		<title>13Employment in Tenby area</title>
		<content> The area that we studied was 2 private
 estates,one council estate,the village
 of New Hedges and neighbouring roads. 
 They proved that more households had  
 two people working in them than one   
 person.                               
 Thirty one households had 2 people    
 working and 29 households had one     
 person working.In two cases three     
 people worked and in two other houses 
 four people worked.                   
   There were 18 people unemployed most
 of them retired,nearly all of these   
 were living on a private estate called
 Upper Hill Park.The number of people  
 unemployed is far lower than in the   
 centre of Tenby,which has quite a high
 unemployment figure.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
