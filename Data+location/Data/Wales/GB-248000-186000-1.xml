		<content> An incredibly diverse area containing 
 a national nature reserve.   A        
 sheltered summer anchorage for small  
 boats.   A great expanse of gloden    
 sand with up to 10,000 visitors on a  
 busy bank holiday, which is backed by 
 a fragile and mobile dune system.     
 Behind the dunes, a secret marshland  
 world of open water surrounded by     
 great reed beds with islands of alder 
 and willow.   The wood covered slopes 
 of the 200ft limestone plateau hide an
 ancient church which serves the nearby
 village.   The village slumbers       
 through winter with several empty     
 cottages, empty holiday chalets and   
 empty camping sites.   In summer the  
 village population increases fivetold 
 and cars snake across the narrow marsh
 road.   To the north lies the southern
 slope of the 600ft red sandstone ridge
 with winter bracken.   Streams rising </content>
