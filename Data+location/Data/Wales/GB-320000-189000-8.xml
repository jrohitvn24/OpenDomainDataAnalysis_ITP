		<content>   The last decade has seen major chan-
 ges in local employment. Male employ- 
 ment in heavy industries has reduced  
 greatly. Risca and Crosskeys have few 
 remaining miners. The steelworks at   
 Llanwern has shed thousands; the alum-
 inium plant at Rogerstone has contrac-
 ted. Many former workers from these   
 industries reside here.               
  Present adult male unemployment is   
 over 30%; for teenagers, 50%.         
  Prospects are very poor in the near  
 future.                               
  There is a wide variety of services  
 employment and a few small light manu-
 facturers. Many employees are female -
 often part-time, often low-paid.      
   Machen, a dormitory village of Caer-
 philly, Newport and Cardiff, has      
 little local employment. Risca and    
 Crosskeys will increase their dor-    
 mitory function in future.            </content>
