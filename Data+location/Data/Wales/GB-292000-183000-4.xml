		<title>04School Trips.</title>
		<content>  One of the most enjoyable events in  
 our school calendar is the school {   
 trip. Each year we draw up a list of  
 places to visit and we usually end up 
 visiting a Wild Life park. There are  
 so many wonderful animals to see and  
 so much to do that we never seem to   
 get tired of these visits. On most of 
 these trips our mothers join us and   
 they seem to enjoy them as much as we 
 do.                                   
  During the 'eighties' we have visited
 the{West Midland's Safari Park, Margam
{Abbey Park, Tenby Wild Life Park,}and 
 this year we visited {Penscynnor Wild 
{Life Park.}Each place has its own     
 speciality.{West Midland's }with its  
 monkey enclosure,{Margam}with its deer
 and{Tenby }with its birds of prey.    
  I am already looking forward to next 
 year's trip.
