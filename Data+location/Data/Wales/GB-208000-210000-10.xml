		<title>10MOLLESTON CHAPEL, TEMPLETON.</title>
		<content>  The Baptist Chapel at Molleston is   
 the oldest chapel in Pembrokeshire. It
 is 254 years old, but the Baptist     
 Movement in Molleston began in 1667.  
 The people met in various places      
 because of religious persecution at   
 that time. Molleston Chapel was built 
 in 1731 and rebuilt in 1884. There is 
 a plaque in memory of Rev. T.L.Parry, 
 who was  the father of Lord Gordon    
 Parry of Neyland. The cottage next to 
 the chapel used to be the Manse until 
 1964.Rev.T.L.Parry lived there from   
 1923-1929. There have been 18         
 ministers. There are 8 deacons, 42    
 members and 25 life members. The      
 oldest member is Mr Roach aged 94. A  
 new organ was installed in 1984. There
 is a special service on the first     
 Sunday in August every year.
