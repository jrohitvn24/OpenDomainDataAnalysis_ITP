		<content> I woke up one morning in December to  
 see a note by the front door saying   
 "School has burnt down. This is not a 
 joke" .I rushed to school and was     
 amazed at what I saw. The roof        
 of the whole of one end of the school 
 had burnt away.                       
 Further problems were in store for us 
 when we discovered that the asbestos  
 which had been left in the roof to be 
 removed in the holidays was now       
 exposed and had been blown throughout 
 the school.                           
 The school was again closed down for a
 week while the mess was cleared up and
 arrangements made for the accomodation
 of those pupils now without a teaching
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
