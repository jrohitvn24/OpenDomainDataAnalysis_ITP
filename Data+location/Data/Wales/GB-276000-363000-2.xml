		<title>02Housing in Trefriw &amp; Maenan</title>
		<content>  Trefriw -hill town- has been a centre
 of population since early times       
 providing a point of easy access      
 between the upland valleys to the     
 North-West and the main Conwy valley, 
 which is tidal to just North of       
 Trefriw.  It enjoyed considerable     
 prosperity during the latter half of  
 the 19C and early years of the 20C as 
 a spa. There are, consequently        
 several large buildings intended to   
 cater for the influx of visitors      
 intent on a cure, and still providing 
 accommodation for the many tourists   
 drawn to this beautiful area. Thus the
 village has a variety of housing, from
 original small cottages and some      
 council houses to large detached      
 houses and modern bungalows.          
  Maenan has a mansion, several farms  
 and small cottages.
