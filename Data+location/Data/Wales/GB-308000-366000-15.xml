		<content>{Tourists}:Apart from some holiday     
 homes tourists do not seem to play any
 part in local life, we found no one   
 offering bed &amp; breakfast or farm      
 holidays. One person had tried letting
 a holiday cottage but had given up    
 because it was too complicated.       
{Footpaths:}There are several footpath 
 in the area which are in good         
 condition &amp; regulary used by rambling 
 groups &amp; individual walkers.          
{Horse-riding}:The local pony club go  
 on treks, picnic rides &amp; paper chases 
 in the area in groups of 20 children  
 with 2 or 3 adults.There is also a    
 local riding stables{.Ploughing       
{matches. Sheepdog trials}.Although    
 these do not always take place within 
 the block there is keen local interest
 and participation in both ploughing   
 matches and sheepdog trials.
