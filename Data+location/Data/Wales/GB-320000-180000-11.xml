		<title>11PENTWYN LEISURE CENTRE</title>
		<content> In line with council policy to provide
 each area with a leisure centre, work 
 started on the 25th of February 1985  
 (hopefully to be finished by early    
 1986). Llanrumney has had its own ({  
{EASTERN LEISURE CENTRE) }since 1982.  
{ (PENTWYN LEISURE CENTRE)}Sited by the
 lake,will have a main hall, community 
 room,conditioning/multi Gym room and  
 an External kick about area for       
 football,or three tennis courts.      
 Changing and storage rooms for both   
 internal and external use.            
  Phase 2 will contain a swimming      
 pool,squash courts,bar lounge,cafe and
 activity area,together with the       
 necessary plant and changing rooms.   
   Local people are not happy because  
 the finance for phase 2 is not        
 available now.They want a swimming    
 pool to be built now.They fear only   
 the first stage will be built.        </content>
