		<content> Local towns are small-less than 6000  
 population. Large towns that are      
 visited include Hereford (very        
 popular),Shrewsbury,Leominster,Ludlow,
 Telford, and Birmingham, but all      
 involve distances from 20 to 80 each  
 way and people must depend on their   
 own transport. Local towns are        
 expensive but there is a supermarket  
 of considerable size "Harry Tuffins"  
 in Knighton which almost everyone goes
 to regularly from a radius of up to   
 twenty miles - the place sells almost 
 everything. Many villages have a store
 and, perhaps, a post office but these 
 are very expensive and are diminishing
 in number steadily.
