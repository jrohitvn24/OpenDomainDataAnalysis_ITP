 At 7.30a.m. I get up and prepare the  
 breakfast table and I eat my breakfast
 of cereal and water. I wake my mother 
 at 8.10a.m. and then I practise       
 my clarinet or piano.                 
 I walk to school with my friend Elis  
 .School starts at 9.00a.m. First we   
 have assembly where we have a         
 religious story.From 9.20a.m. to

 have Welsh until 12.10p.m. We have our
 lunch and then playtime until
