{Ysgol Borth-y-Gest}and{Ysgol Eifion   
{Wyn.}Children are admitted to the     
 nursery classes at the age of three.  
 In Eifion Wyn there are 128 pupils in 
 the infants section and 132 in the    
 juniors.Up to the age of 7 the main   
 language used is Welsh because the    
 children need a good basis in their   
 mother-tongue.From the age of 7 the   
 children are taught in English and    
 Welsh so that they will become        
 bilingual.The subjects taught are:    
 reading,writing,maths,painting,music  
 (harp,violin,recorder),handwork,local 
 history and geography,computers,      
 English and Welsh.There are 11        
 teachers at the school,including the  
 headmaster and a teacher in charge of 
 the infants,plus 3 peripatetic        
 teachers for music.
