		<title>16The Sports Association.</title>
		<content> Three years ago the County Council    
 wanted a place to build a new school.A
 Sports Association of all sporting    
 clubs had just been formed and        
 everybody knew that half the Playing  
 field was never used.The field        
 Committee was asked to sell the top   
 half for a new school and use the     
 funds gained to improve the facilities
 at the field.                         
 Firstly the field was levelled and    
 Changing Rooms were built,the         
 voluntary labour and the monies raised
 was probably worth about #25000!      
 This year we have seen the second     
 phase finished,the two tennis courts. 
 Some want the next phase to be a      
 Bowling Green,but in the beginning it 
 was planned to provide an extra large 
 hall for the new school,this could    
 then be used by us for indoor         
 sport.Badminton is played in the Hall.</content>
