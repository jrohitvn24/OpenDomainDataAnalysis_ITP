		<title>13Shotwick Church.</title>
		<content> St.Michael's Shotwick is a very old   
 sandstone church,situated in a        
 secluded and romantic setting.The     
 church and the group of old houses    
 forming the little village.On the very
 old wall around the church we can     
 today see the linked chains that were 
 used years ago to chain the boats to  
 the church wall,but today the sea is  
 some 3 to 4 kilometres away.As you    
 enter the Norman doorway-built in the 
 15th century you can see groves worn  
 in the stone in the porch made by 16th
 century archers sharpening their      
 arrows.In the east window there is    
 14th century glass while the pulpit is
 3 decked.In the windows of the chancel
 and chapel are the remains of the very
 highly coloured painted glass,        
 originally representing figures and   
 shrine work.In the North Aisle-East   
 window we see Mary and Gabriel.       </content>
