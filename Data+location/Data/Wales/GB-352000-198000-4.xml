		<title>04TINTERN VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  The village is situated on the       
 western bank of the River Wye and has 
 been forced to extend lengthways along
 the river due to the steeply rising   
 valley side at this point.It was      
 originally located to utilise the     
 faster flow of water from the valley  
 side for industrial purposes,an       
 advantage now obselete since the      
 development of alternative power      
 sources.There is now,locally,no       
 industry other than Tourism.          
  Tintern simply consists of activities
 associated with the Abbey and provides
 six hotels/inns.The petrol pumps,post 
 office,general store/butcher,newsagent
 and off-licence cater for residents,  
 with a large craft shop and one or two
 antique shops for tourists.           
  There is a doctors' surgery on the   
 river bank in the middle of the       
 village.                              </content>
