		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN RHYMNEY</title>
		<content> It is a sad reality that this area has
 suffered more than most in terms of   
 unemployment and a general decline in 
 the infra-structure of the area.With  
 any area of high unemployment, there  
 are many associated problems,which are
 a direct result of such a state.It is 
 evident that this area,so typical of  
 the Welsh Valleys,is in a state of dis
 -enchantment.With the decline of the  
 basic heavy industries ,iron,steel and
 coal on which the area was founded in 
 the 19th Century,alternative          
 employment was confined to a few large
 employers.With insufficient           
 diversification,the closure of any one
 of these employers has had devastating
 effects on the community.The area is  
 in a slow state of decline due mainly 
 to a lack of industrial involvement   
 and not to the efforts of the         
 community at large.                   </content>
