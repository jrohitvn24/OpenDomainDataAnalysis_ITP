		<title>16ST.DAVID.</title>
		<content> St. David is the patron saint of      
 Wales. He was born around 1400 years  
 ago. His mother and father called him 
 David because this means Beloved and  
 they and everyone else loved him very 
 much.                                 
     He went to school in Dyfed. The   
 school was a monastery where he       
 learned to read and write about God.  
 When he was older he became a priest. 
 He travelled around and spread the    
 word of God. He ended his travells in 
 Wales where he built a monastery. Here
 he lived with other monks and led a   
 very frugal life but he was very kind 
 to others. He died in the year A.D.   
 589. A cathedral now stands on the    
 site of his monastery. It is called   
 St. David's Cathedral.
