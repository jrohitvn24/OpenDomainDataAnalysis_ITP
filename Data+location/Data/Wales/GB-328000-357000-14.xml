		<title>14A DAY IN MY LIFE - SATURDAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 8.20 because I have to go 
 for swimming{(Recreation)}lessons at  
 Mold baths.  After a drink of coffee, 
 I get changed, then get my swimming   
 gear together.  We start to go at 9.10
 because my lesson is at 9.30.  We     
 travel there in our car which is a    
 Maxi.  After my swimming lesson       
 finishes at 10.00, my mother, sister  
 and I go into Mold where, on a        
 Saturday and Wednesday there is a     
 street market, because Mold is a      
 market town.  We look around the      
 stalls and shops and buy some fruit   
 and vegetables and clothes.  When we  
 get home we have hot-dogs for dinner. 
 If it is a hot day I go with some boys
 from the village to a place called the
 Mill, where the river Terrig runs     
 through and we have fun pushing one   
 another in and the boys try to catch  
 fish.                                 </content>
