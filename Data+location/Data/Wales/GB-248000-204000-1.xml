		<content>{Five Roads}village (population 400)   
 lies 5.6km north of Llanelli on the   
 B4309 Carmarthen-Llanelli road.The    
 road lies on a ridge seperating head  
 waters of the Lliedi and Morlais      
 rivers.It lies at the meeting point of
 five roads leading to the villages and
 countryside around.It is a long       
 established agricultural settlement   
 but since the closure of the          
 brickworks in 1967 most people commute
 to Llanelli or Cynheidre.Cynheidre    
 village(population 100)is a small     
 hamlet located 0.8 km north of Five   
 Roads.The last remaining coalmine in  
 the borough is here containing        
 valuable anthracite reserves.The      
 principle shafts and surface          
 facilities are here although a further
 shaft is located 4.8km east.The NCB is
 currently prospecting with the Five   
 Roads area for fresh reserves.        </content>
