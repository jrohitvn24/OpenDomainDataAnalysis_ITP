		<title>18Salem Memorial Hall</title>
		<content>{  The Memorial Hall}in Salem was built
 (originally of Army Huts) in 1923,  in
 memory  of the five local men who gave
 their lives in the 1914-18 war. Inside
 a plaque (in Welsh ) gives their names
 and addresses.    Today the Hall is of
 brick construction,    and houses such
 groups as the W.I.,and pre-school Play
 Group.    The Hall Committee organises
 Whist Drives and Welsh Drama visits.  
    The Hall plays an important part in
 village life, by providing a place for
 the villagers to meet.
