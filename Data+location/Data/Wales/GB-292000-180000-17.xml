		<title>17TRANSPORT IN PENCOED</title>
		<content>      Roads to-day are the most        
 important means of transport in       
 Britain and Pencoed is very near one  
 of the motorways linking all the      
 country. The M4 runs alongside Pencoed
 and this is the motorway that joins   
 South Wales with London.  Junction 35 
 is west of our area with the motorway 
 running to Junction 36 which is north 
 of Coity.                             
      The main road through Pencoed is 
 quieter since the opening of a by-pass
 which joins the motorway.             
      Railways are another important   
 means of transport and the main London
 to Fishguard line runs through the    
 centre of Pencoed. The old railway    
 station has been closed and there are 
 several delays at the crossing gates  
 now that the footbridge has been taken
 down.                                 
                                       </content>
