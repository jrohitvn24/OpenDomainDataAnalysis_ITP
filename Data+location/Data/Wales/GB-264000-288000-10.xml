		<content>     IRON AGE FORTS                    
 There are two iorn age forts in our   
 block.They are LLETY-LLWYD and        
 ALLT-GOCH.These iron age forts are    
 built on high ground with a slope     
 down each side,on this slope are three
 fences.There is a road leading up one 
 side of the slope with a gate on it.  
 Iron age forts were built on high     
 ground so that they could see the     
 enemy coming and had the              
 advantage when they were attacked. {  
{CELTS}lived in these forts on the top 
 level and kept their animals in the   
 middle section.There is a theory      
 in this area that when one fort was   
 attacked they would light a fire on   
 the top to warn a fort nearby of the  
 approaching enemy.The CELTS used iron 
 to make weapons and tools,they were   
 some of the first farmers.They made   
 roads on high ground to avoid bogs.   </content>
