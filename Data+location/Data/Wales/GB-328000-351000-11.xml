		<title>11TANYFRON</title>
		<content>      {Tanyfron}is the other village in
 the south western corner of the       
 square.It is far smaller than         
 Coedpoeth and was founded by the need 
 for workers at the{Vron Colliery}which
 started production at the end of the  
 19th Century.The colliery is now      
 closed.                               
                                       
       The remainder of the land around
 Tanyfron which is not being used for  
 industrial purposes is given up to    
 grazing of Friesian cattle and for the
 growing of silage to feed the herds   
 during the winter months.The land is  
 hilly with dividing sections of hedges
 which include a copious number of     
 deciduous trees.
