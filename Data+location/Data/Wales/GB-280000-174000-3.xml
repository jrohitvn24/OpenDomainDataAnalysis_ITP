		<content> Being a popular tourist resort,       
 inevitably a lot of people,living in  
 the town,use this as their source of  
 employment,working in catering,hotels 
 and shops.                            
 There have large new housing          
 developments all round the town in    
 recent years and being so close to the
 industrial area of Port Talbot and    
 Bridgend,the natural beauty of the    
 area has attracted people with        
 industrial backgrounds to settle in   
 the town.                             
 Today it is fast becoming a dormitary 
 town for the more successful workers  
 in the prosperous industries and local
 government.This is probably the reason
 why in a traditionally Labour         
 stronghold,at the last election,the   
 Tory candidate was voted as the M.P.  
                                       
                                       </content>
