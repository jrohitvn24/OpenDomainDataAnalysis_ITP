		<content> I moved to live down here recently    
 from Birmingham.Since I've been here I
 have noticed that not all of the      
 people who live in this area are      
 Welsh.The area is not what I expected 
 it to be.I notice that there are quite
 a lot of hamlets around,but there are 
 hardly any shops.I live in a village  
 called Bontdolgadfan.Really it is     
 quite nice in our area because        
 wherever you go you can see hills and 
 trees all around you,and if you are   
 lucky you might even see various kinds
 of birds,like the buzzard and heron.  
 Some people own houses here,but only  
 come here on weekends.Their houses are
 called second homes.                  
 My name is Susan Davies.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
