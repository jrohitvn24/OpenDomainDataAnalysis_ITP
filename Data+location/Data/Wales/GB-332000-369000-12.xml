		<title>12Shotwick Village</title>
		<content> Shotwick is a beautiful little village
 going back many centuries in history, 
 when it was a very busy port.In Roman 
 times it was used to ship Cheshire    
 Salt.For many centuries the journey   
 from to Chester to Shotwick was made  
 along Saltesway which is the "Kyng's  
 Highway near Chester to lede the hoost
 of our Sovreyn Lord the Kyng in tyme  
 of warre into Shotwick Ford." The road
 served Shotwick Castle (which is now  
 marked by earthworks)and is supposed  
 to have been used by Henry III in 1245
 when he led a great army into Wales   
 and again by Edward I in 1278.The     
 road, now a cobbled lane and a bridge 
 crossing the little brook, still      
 exists below Shotwick.As a port       
 Shotwick was in its heyday in the 13th
 and 14th centuries.It could be that   
 the word "wik" come from the Norse    
 meaning "Greek".                      </content>
