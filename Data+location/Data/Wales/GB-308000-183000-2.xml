		<content> Gwaelod-y-Garth is a small village    
 perched on a hill, overlooking TAFFS  
 WELL.                                 
 The community seems to be split into  
 two very distinct factions.           
 The old people who have have lived in 
 the village all of their lives, and   
 the smart young set, with large       
 cars... and even larger bank accounts!
 The feeling amongst the older         
 residents is that these               
 young 'professional' people care more 
 about property values than they do    
 about community life.                 
 Contact between the two groups is     
 almost non existant, and his leads to 
 no small amount of distrust.          
 Some of the young people do make the  
 effort to join in, but the number is  
 nowhere near enough.
