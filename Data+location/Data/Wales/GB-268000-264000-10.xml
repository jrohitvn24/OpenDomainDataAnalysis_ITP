		<title>10A TYPICAL DAY(CONT)</title>
		<content>  My best friend is Benny and I always 
 play with him.At playtime             
 we normally play football.The normal  
 team is me, Benny and my brother Mark 
 against all the other boys,and we     
 still win.We have half an hour        
 playtime, and intime is at eleven     
 o'clock and play begins at half an    
 hour past ten.After intime we do sums 
 or English for forty five minutes,    
 until eleven forty five, then we get  
 ready for dinner .We go to the toilet 
 and wash our hands,then say our       
 prayers.Then we go out to play while  
 the first sitting eat.They take about 
 half an hour to finish their meal.We  
 are faster because we are much        
 older.The bell is rang at one o'clock.
 Each afternoon we do something        
 different-today is special,it's       
 Thursday-football day.Ilove football. 
 We usually play for about an hour.    </content>
