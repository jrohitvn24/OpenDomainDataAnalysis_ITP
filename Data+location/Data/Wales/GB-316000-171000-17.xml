		<content> The main Christian denominations are  
 well represented within the grid area.
 Church in Wales(8 churches),Non conf- 
 ormists(10 churches), Roman Catholic  
 (1 church) and Salvation Army(1 hall).
 The oldest Christian foundation in the
 area, St. Dochdwy's in Llandough,     
 contains an ancient Irbic Cross, now  
 in the care of the Dept. of the Envir-
 onment. St. Augustine's is the main   
 parish church of Penarth- within the  
 graveyard is the tomb of Dr.J. Parry  
 the famous hymn writer. As you would  
 expect in Wales the various Non-Confo-
 rmist churches are found, Baptist,    
 Methodist, Presbyterian and United    
 Reform. St. Joseph's in Wordsworth    
 Ave. is the Roman Catholic church for 
 the area. The Salvation Army have a   
 hall in Plassey St.. Non Christian    
 denominations generally seem to go to 
 Cardiff to worship.                   </content>
