		<content> There are two valleys in our survey   
 area the Rhymney and Deri valleys .In 
 New Tredegar there was a pit called   
 Elliot Pit, now there is a school     
 called Elliot Town Primary School.    
 Near the school there is a disused    
 Winding House. There are factories in 
 New Tredegar producing: plastic chairs
 etc. and chemicals.On the other side  
 of the river there is a railway track 
 that runs from Rhymney to             
 Cardiff.There used to be a railway    
 track running through the valley but  
 this is now part of a park.There are  
 three villages  in New Tredegar,      
 Cwmsyfiog, Elliot Town and            
 Phillipstown.There are six primary    
 schools in our area.There are two     
 rivers,and these join just South of   
 our survey area.Over 99% of the
