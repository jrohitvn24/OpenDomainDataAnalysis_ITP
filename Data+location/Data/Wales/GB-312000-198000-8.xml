		<content> GILFACH SHOPPING - Gilfach's shopping 
 street is dominated by small units    
 converted from 'front rooms' of       
 houses. There are 16 units, 50% of    
 which are food units. There are at    
 present 9 empty premises. These are   
 indicative of the fall in use of local
 shops, probably due to the poor walk- 
 ways and the volume of through        
 traffic, and of course, the proximity 
 of Bargoed.                           
 ABERBARGOED SHOPPING - Aberbargoed has
 quite a range of typical small units. 
 74% of the villagers use one shop at  
 least once a week. However, the bulk  
 of food purchases are made out of the 
 village (48% in Bargoed and 39%       
 elsewhere; e.g. Carrefour, Asda). 77% 
 of Aberbargoed people make  the       
 journey to Bargoed on Market Day      
 (Thursday) on a regular basis.
