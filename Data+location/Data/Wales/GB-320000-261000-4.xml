		<content> FRONTING THE ROAD WHICH RUNS          
 DIAGONALLY THROUGH THE AREA FROM NEW  
 RADNOR TO KINNERTON AND IN LANES      
 LEADING OFF ARE SOME 30 DWELLINGS OF  
 WHICH 23 ARE PERMANENTLY OCCUPIED.    
 SIX ARE FARM HOUSES, FOUR HOLIDAY     
 COTTAGES AND TWO ARE UNOCCUPIED.      
 ANOTHER IS A MOBILE HOME/SCHOOL USED  
 AS A FIELD STUDY CENTRE.  IT IS       
 CURRENTLY FOR SALE BUT THERE IS LITTLE
 DEMAND FOR SUCH A PLACE AS THE COUNCIL
 IS RELUCTANT TO ALLOW CHANGE OF USE TO
 RESIDENTIAL STATUS.  MOST HOUSES ARE  
 MODERNISED OLD FARM HOUSES OR         
 COTTAGES.  ONE IS AN ORIGINAL         
 UNMODERNISED WELSH LONGHOUSE, THE     
 ANIMAL ACCOMMODATION AND LIVING       
 QUARTERS BEING CONTAINED UNDER ONE    
 ROOF.  THERE ARE ALSO SEVEN NEW HOUSES
 OR BUNGALOWS DOTTED ABOUT THE AREA.   
 ALL HOUSES HAVE RUNNING WATER,        
 ELECTRICITY AND SOME MAIN DRAINAGE.   </content>
