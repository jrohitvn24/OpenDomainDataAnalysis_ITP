		<content>  This is a game called Stuck in the   
 Mud.You can play with as many people  
 as you like.First someone is on it.   
 They chase you and once you have been 
 touched you have to stay in the place 
 where they touched you.You put your   
 arms and legs apart.Someone will crawl
 half way under your legs.Once they    
 have done that you wait till the      
 person that is on it is quite a long  
 way away.You can then run away as fast
 as you can.You do that all the time.  
 In British Bulldog you have to line up
 on one side of the play ground.The    
 person that is on it says,"British    
 Bulldog one two three".We all have to 
 run to the other side of the play     
 ground.The one who is on it has to    
 catch someone and say "British Bulldog
 one two three"Then  the person who is 
 caught has to be on it with the       
 catcher.                              </content>
