		<content> I live in Newtown,at 12,Colwyn Terrace
 in the county of Powys.I have been    
 living here for four years.Before I   
 came here{I lived in Vietnam.I came by
 aeroplane;I don't remember much about 
 it.In Vietnam, where I lived we did   
 not have a garden in the front or the 
 back.In my house in Vietnam upstairs  
 we had one bedroom and downstairs we  
 had one bed.Sone of us slept on mats  
 on the floor.My mum made envelopes in 
 Vietnam,In Newtown she makes          
 earrings.My dad was manager of a      
 factory in Vietnam.There I lived in a 
 big{city;it was called Saigon.
