		<title>16OUR LOCAL VICAR</title>
		<content>  The local Vicar works very hard.  He 
 has to be an 'office manager' as there
 is much typing, telephoning and       
 record-keeping to be done.  He is also
 a Chairman, taking charge of all      
 Church meetings. Thirdly, he is a     
 caretaker, responsible for the care   
 and upkeep of the Church.  He is a    
 teacher to both children and adults   
 and in addition to this he is a       
 pastor, visiting and helping people in
 need.  Finally, he has to take        
 services such as burials, marriages   
 and christenings.  His job has the    
 advantages of a free house, holidays  
 when he likes, a pension and a welcome
 into everyone's home.  The hardest    
 part of the job is trying to find time
 to spend with his family, as people   
 may need help at any time. The        
 most enjoyable part of his job is     
 never knowing what will happen next.  </content>
