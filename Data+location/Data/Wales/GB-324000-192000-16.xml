		<title>16GAMES WE PLAY IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In school, we like to play "Please    
 Grandma Grey, may we go out to        
 play?". If the person picked as       
 "Grandma Grey" says  'No' then we keep
 chanting the song until they change th
 eir minds.Then we run off shouting "Sh
 oo!Shoo!".Then "Granny Grey" yells,"Ch
 ildren" We say "Yes Granny Grey."She t
 hen asks us where we've been,we reply 
 "To Aunty Mays farm."Granny Grey then 
 asks "What did she give you?"We all si
 ng,"A bowl of jelly as big as my belly
 ,a lump of cheese as big as my knees,a
 nd a teeny weeny sixpence."Granny asks
 us "Wheres mine?" "Up on the shelf" we
 all shout,"How do I get it?"she then  
 asks "Climb on the stool"we answer,"Wh
 at if I fall?"she screams.We all yell 
 "We dont care."Granny Grey then chases
 after us,and the first one she catches
 then becomes Granny Grey,and the game 
 then starts all over again.    S.D    </content>
