		<title>12ST.MICHEAL'S PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The size of the church is fairly     
 large. It was built in 1853. The      
 material they used to built it was    
 stone. The windows are arch shaped    
 and are also stained glass. In the    
 nave there are thirty pews; in the    
 chancel there are 4 seats and two     
 spare. The altar is rectangular shaped
 and has some items such as candle     
 sticks and a cross.The vicar reads    
 from a Bible in the pulpit.The Bible  
 was on the lectern. The furniture is  
 made of wood and is very hard and     
 there is a bench on the floor to kneel
 on.The altar is made of wood and the  
 font is made from stone. Outside the  
 church you can see heads of bishops   
 and there is a grave of the first     
 vicar whose name was David Jones. By  
 the door there is a foot scraper. This
 is for scraping your feet before you  
 enter.                                </content>
