		<content>     Although the area has numerous    
 public footpaths and attractive       
 scenary, its use as farmlamd, and the 
 proximity of the wide open spaces of  
 the mountains mean that it is         
 neglected as a recreational area.  On 
 the river however some recreation     
 takes place. At periods of high water 
 during the summer months water-skiers 
 are to be seen in the area having     
 travelled upstream from Conwy.        
 Canoeists also use the river and every
 July the Conwy River Raft Race is held
 and passes through this stretch of    
 river.
