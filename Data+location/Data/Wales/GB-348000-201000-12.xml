		<title>12The Llangibby Hunt</title>
		<content> The oldest recorded hunt in the county
 is called Llangibby.  It was formed in
 l683.  Many more people ride with it  
 now as horse riding is a popular local
 recreation. On weekends there are     
 about lOO riders.  They wear black or 
 red riding habit.  Usually the first  
 hunt is in November. Christmas and the
 New Year attracts a great number of   
 protesters who lay false smells for   
 the hounds. There are 62 couples of   
 hounds - 64 in all. The hunters       
 usually cover about 2O miles.         
 Sometimes there are injuries -        
 cuts,bruises and even broken ribs and 
 the hounds too can get hurt going     
 through wire fencing.  The hunt meets 
 at different locations - houses, pubs 
 or farms.  Most farmers welcome the   
 hunt onto their land to keep down the 
 foxes.
