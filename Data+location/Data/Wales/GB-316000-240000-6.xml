 This is an all grass farm of about 90 
 acres.It is situated in the west of   
 our region.The interesting feature    
 about this farm is its pedigree herd  
 of Herefordshire cattle.There are 35  
 cows and 2 bulls.They are bred for    
 beef only.This type of herd is not as 
 profitable or as popular as it used to
 be although they are cheap to rear.   
 As each calf is born it has to be     
 registered and its pedigree can be    
 traced back 50 years.                 
 They eat grass and hay with some bran,
 rolled oats,beetpulp,flakemaize and   
 minerals.They grow 5 fields of hay    
 which makes 3,000 bales.No corn is    
 grown.They keep 150 sheep.They have   
 their own pure water supply which is  
 pumped up through a 60ft.bore hole.The
 farm supports 4 people.There is 1 part
 time helper.                          </content>
