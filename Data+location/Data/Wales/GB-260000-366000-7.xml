          _______                      
 There are 4 Primary schools in our    
 area and 1 Comprehensive.We are taught
 through the medium of Welsh because it
 is our home language.A lot of English 
 children who have moved to live here  
 learn the language very quickly.When  
 we are 11 years old we move from the  
 Primary school to the secondary       
 school.Our school has 190             
 children,including infants and        
 juniors.There are 12 teachers,three   
 men and nine women.                   
                    School starts at   
 9.00a.m and ends at 3.30p.m(infants   
 finish at 3.00p.m).We have a break at 
 10.30a.m for quarter of an hour and a 
 lunch break of 1 hour from 12.00p.m   
 till 1.00p.m.
