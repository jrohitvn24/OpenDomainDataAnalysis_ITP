		<content>    The area is bisected by the        
{M.4.Motorway,}south of which the      
 primary land cover is housing,mostly  
 modern,and privately owned forming    
 dormitory suburbs whose population are
 largely employed outside the area. At 
{Thornhill,}in the west, housing       
 development is being undertaken at    
 present,on land that was previously   
 used for arable farming. North of the 
 M.4. the land rises steeply and       
 assumes a more mountainous nature. It 
 is sparsely populated,but supports    
 mixed farming and forestry,with sheep 
 grazing the steeper and less fertile  
 ground. In the past, this upland      
 region has provided quarries and mines
 for stone and mineral extraction,but  
 these are now disused.
