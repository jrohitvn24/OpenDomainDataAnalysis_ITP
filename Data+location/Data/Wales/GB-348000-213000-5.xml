		<content>  When I first came to the school,the  
 environment was very different from my
junior school.Everything was so big.It 
did not take long for me to get used to
the many classrooms and timetable.We do
homework but I do not like it when I   
have to give it in the next day.       
  School dinners are very nice.You can 
have anything you want.There is a menu 
but you can order a special.There is a 
variety of confectionary and puddings. 
  We have many more subjects than in my
primary school.Craft is fun.I like     
history and science.I cannot wait till 
we do experiments with chemicals.Games 
are good but I get tired after swimming
Ido not like changing classrooms and   
walking from one end of the school to  
the other in the rain                  
  I come from outside the catchment    
area because my parents heard it is a  
good school.I am glad I came here.     </content>
