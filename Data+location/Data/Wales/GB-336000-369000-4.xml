		<content>   In Saughall the older housing is    
 built around 2 roads,one leading from 
 Chester and the other running from    
 East to West linked to the Wirral and 
 to Wales.Behind these two roads a     
 modern estate has been built.         
   Mollington lies between two main    
 roads leading to the Wirral and to    
 Liverpool and Backford lies beyond the
 road to Liverpool.Over 90% of the     
 housing in our area is owned by the   
 occupants and there is no slum        
 clearance.                            
   About 98% of the houses are made of 
 red brick with a tiled roof whilst the
 remainder are of sandstone,pebbledash 
 or are whitewashed.The housing is     
 predominantly semi-detatched,followed 
 numerically by detatched, bungalows,  
 terraced property,farm house and      
 cottages.Over 80% have garages.All    
 homes have front and back gardens.    </content>
