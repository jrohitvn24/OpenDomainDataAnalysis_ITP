		<title>09ROYAL CHARTER MOELFRE 2</title>
		<content> On Monday, 10th July we visited Porth 
 Helaeth to see the divers salvaging   
 the Royal Charter. We could see their 
 camp- a large white tent. There were  
 three divers on watch all night       
 guarding the equipment. The camp was  
 swarming with photographers and       
 journalists. We had our photos taken  
 for the newspapers.                   
    Out at sea we could see several    
 buoys where the divers had marked the 
 length of the wreck. We were amazed at
 its size. Above the wreck there was a 
 rubber dinghy, two boats and a large  
 pipe between them. The pipe  sucked up
 mud from the wreck. Three quarters of 
 The R.Ch is buried under 20ft of mud. 
 This must be cleared. The divers have 
 only cleared 20sq.ft. of sand, but    
 have found lots of treasure and       
 artefacts.          Kim Howard
