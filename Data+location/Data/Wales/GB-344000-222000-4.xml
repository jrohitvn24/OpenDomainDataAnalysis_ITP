		<title>04Coming to School on the Bus</title>
		<content> I get on the bus at Pontrilas. We go  
 past St. Mary's Church, Kentchurch,   
 and the drive of Kentchurch Court,    
 which is a big house like a castle.   
 People live in one side of the        
 gatehouse, but the other side is used 
 for storing things. We pick up Tristan
 at the end of his drive, then we pick 
 up Stephen in Kentchurch. We go past  
 the River Monnow, and we see a bridge 
 that goes over it. One of its supports
 is very shaky. We go past Demesne Farm
 and the drive to Lodge Farm. In the   
 summer we see lots of bale hauling and
 silaging. We meet farm lorries and    
 tractors on the road. We sometimes see
 a milk tanker that comes to collect   
 the milk from the farms. When we come 
 home in the evening we usually pass   
 the bus taking older children home    
 from the Comprehensive School in      
 Kingstone.                            </content>
