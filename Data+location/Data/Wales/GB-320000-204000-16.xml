		<content> The valley sides in the{Cwmtillery    
{Valley}are of interest because of the 
{natural woodland}that has survived.   
 These woodlands are of conservation   
 interest for phytosociological and    
 habitat diversity reasons.            
 Much of the area is made up of rough  
 grazing and the open nature of the    
 mountain tops is important for public 
 access.                               
                                       
                                       
 There is little pollution outside the 
 urban area and what there is is       
 associated with the Roseheyworth      
 Colliery and the River Ebbw Fach.     
                                       
 The other important ecological feature
 is the reclaimation of old coal       
 tips;many of these have been seeded   
 and landscaped.
