		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF PAUL</title>
		<content> A typical Saturday for me starts at   
 8.45am.Last Saturday was a sunny day  
 so I put my shorts and T-shirt on.I   
 had breakfast of grapefruit,Ricicles  
 and toast.At ten o'clock I went out on
 my bike to Penrhyn Bay and back.At    
 half past twelve I had a snack        
 lunch.Then I went to my bedroom and   
 played some "Shadows"music whilst     
 playing with my Matchbox cars.        
 At two o'clock I went into the garden 
 to play football and rounders with my 
 brother Adam and his friend Martin.   
 Later I went out on my bike again.I   
 went to Hotel 70 Degrees and returned 
 a different way.At five o'clock I had 
 my tea of rump steak and vegetables,  
 with Black Forest Gateau for sweet.I  
 sat down in the lounge for the evening
 and watched television and at eight   
 thirty I went to bed.
