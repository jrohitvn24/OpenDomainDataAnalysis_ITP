		<content>  Some people believe in ghosts and    
 some don't. I too don't believe in    
 ghosts.                               
  Some people say that they have seen  
 ghosts and that they are a misty white
 and they glow.You can always tell     
 if there is a ghost around; the place 
 goes cold and the temperature goes    
 very low.                             
  In Calcoed there used to be a race   
 course near where they are making the 
 new road.There was a well.Where this  
 woman and her horse wanted to jump    
 it.Well one day the woman jumped the  
 well but they both fell down. From    
 that  day to this,people say that     
 they have seen the woman and the      
 horse,but nobody has ever found the   
 bodies.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
