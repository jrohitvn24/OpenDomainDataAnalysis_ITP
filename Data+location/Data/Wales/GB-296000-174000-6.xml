		<title>06A Visit to Llwynhelyg Farm</title>
		<content>  On Wednesday 5th June some children  
 from Y Bont Faen School went to       
 Llwynhelyg Farm. Major Homphrey, the  
 owner of the farm, showed them around 
 and answered some questions. The farm 
 is 1700 acres; 1400 acres of grassland
 and 300 acres cropland. Llwynhelyg    
 Farm has 89 fields. Occupying the     
 fields are 700 sheep and 950 lambs.   
 The sheep are dipped in March, the end
 of May, June and July. The sheep are  
 dipped to get rid of scabs or bugs.   
 After being clipped the sheeps wool   
 amounts to over 3tons. The wool then  
 goes to the Wool Board. The cattle are
 usually sold at the market in town but
 this year they had the auction on the 
 farm. The cows didn't have names they 
 had numbers on small discs which were 
 tagged to their ears. The cows' extra 
 feed was barley. 700 lambs were sold  
 at the auction for Â£35:00 each.       </content>
