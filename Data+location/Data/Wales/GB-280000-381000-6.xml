  There are five{chapels}in Penrhyn    
 side. It is nicknamed the{Holy City   
 but hardly anyone goes to chapel now. 
 During the reign of{Queen Elizabeth 1 
 many Welsh Catholics were loyal to the
 old faith. The{Pugh Family}who lived  
 in Penrhyn Old Hall continued to      
 practice their religion secretly but  
 in 1582 were outlawed as{Recusants.}  
 The fine for not attending Anglican   
 services was Â£20 per month. At this   
 time a cave on the Little Orme -{Ty yn
{y Graig, the house in the rock}- was  
 the site of a secret printing press   
 where a Welsh catechism {"Athrawiaith 
{Cristionogol" }was printed. The cave  
 is still there; the Pugh family have  
 gone; Penrhyn Old Hall is now a       
 nightclub and the little chapel is in 
 ruins.
