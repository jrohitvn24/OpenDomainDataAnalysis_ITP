		<content> Many of the nineteenth century homes  
 in the Cynon Valley lacked indoor     
 toilets and no bathrooms until quite  
 recently.{Indeed quite a number still 
{lack many of the basic ammenities that
{you would associate with twentieth    
{century housing.}A large number of    
 residents have taken advantage of     
{Local Authority Housing Grants}in     
 order to instal these basic ammenities
 to their homes.In fact new flat roofed
 extensions at the backs of houses are 
 a common sight. There also exists the 
{Cynon Taff Housing Association}which  
 buys up poor housing stock to renovate
 them to the necessary standard.They   
 are then rented to various families.  
 There is little house building taking 
 place at present as there is a decline
 in the population,but there are some  
 examples of modern houses and         
 bungalows to be found.                </content>
