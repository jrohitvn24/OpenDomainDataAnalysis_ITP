		<title>18HOME LIFE-A TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content>      This is an example of my home    
 life. I am quite a light sleeper. I   
 wake at 7.0.p.m.                      
      I have brown bread and honey,then
 I put my clothes on, which is a skirt 
 and top. Then I walk to school, I work
 as hard as I can in school and try to 
 get high scores. I play three musical 
 instruments-the recorder, guitar and  
 violin cello. Each night when I get   
 home I have to do l5 minutes 'cello   
 practice. I mostly have salad for tea 
 or something that does not take too   
 long. I go to bed at nine o'clock.    
 Sometimes I go a little later. I have 
 one sister called Emma, she is twelve 
 years old. I have a pet guinea-pig    
 called Tiffy, my sister did have one  
 called Honey but it died.             
      We have quite a lot of blossom   
 trees in our back garden.
