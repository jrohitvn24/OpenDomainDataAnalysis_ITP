		<title>18Conservation and Wildlife</title>
		<content> In this area wildlife is most abudant.
 Mammals include foxes, badgers,       
 rabbits, hares and grey squirrels.    
 Roadside verges are only cut in late  
 summer so all can enjoy the wild      
 flowers.  Reptiles especially frog ad 
 toads are common and both slow worms  
 and common lizards have been observed.
 It is birds however that are the most 
 noticable form of wildlife for the    
 visitor.  Buzzards, wren, goldcrest   
 and goldfinch are common.  Jays visit 
 and owls can be heard if not seen.  A 
 nuthatch, a great spotted woodpecker  
 and long tailed tits have been noted. 
 The main reason forthis abundance is  
 perhaps that farmers almost           
 unwittingly practise conservation by  
 leaving woods and hedges intact.      
 There is also minimal use of chemical 
 sprays.  The almost total lack of     
 industry also makes for clean air.    </content>
