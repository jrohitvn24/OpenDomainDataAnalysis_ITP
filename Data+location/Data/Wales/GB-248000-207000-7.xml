		<title>07Farming around Mynydd Sylen.</title>
		<content> There are 12 small farms and small    
 holdings in this area.Hay and silage  
 are the main crops needed to keep the 
 cattle and sheep fed through the      
 winter.The fields are small and       
 separated by hedges.Most of the land  
 is used as pasture for the            
 animals.Friesians and Welsh Blacks are
 the varieties of cattle favoured in   
 this area.                            
 Some of the farms are still dairy     
 farms,but the Common Market Milk Quota
 System has forced farmers to leave    
 dairying and go into beef production. 
 This is more profitable and also less 
 work.                                 
 The farms are mainly one man family   
 businesses.Intensive farming is not   
 practised in this area.
