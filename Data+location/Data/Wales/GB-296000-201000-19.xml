		<content> There is a plaque to Edward Edward who
 died in 1836 after fighting in the    
 Alamo.There is also a man from        
 Aberaman believed to be a dwarf who   
 was buried standing up in the walls of
 St.Johns so that everybody would have 
 to look up at him.Also somebody was   
 buried in a leaded coffin so that the 
 stench from his body wouldn't enter   
 the church.                           
    In 1795 the first circulating      
 school with 60 pupils was started in  
 the church.Inside the church there is 
 the priest's door from 1740 and also a
 piscina for the priest to wash his    
 hands before the communion.The stained
 glass window on the west wall was made
 by John Pitts also the Westminster    
 architects have been to the church.
