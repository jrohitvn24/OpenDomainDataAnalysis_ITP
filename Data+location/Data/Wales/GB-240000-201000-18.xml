		<title>18Penybedd Farm</title>
		<content>  Penybedd Farm is over 200 years old  
 and is one of the oldest farms in the 
 area. Its a mixed farm of 400 acres.  
 There are milking cows, beef cattle,  
 pigs and turkeys on the farm.         
 The farmer's day begins at 7am there  
 are lots of jobs to do _ feeding and  
 cleaning the animals, looking after   
 the fences and buildings and keeping  
 the land in good order. Most of the   
 workers are members of the family but 
 sometimes when they are busy some     
 casual labourers and friends help.    
     There are many pieces of machinery
 on the farm e.g tractors, ploughs,    
 harrows and rollers.Today machines are
 bigger, more complex and some are even
 computerized. Mr Davies goes to       
 Carmarthen mart every week. Help and  
 advice is freely available from ADAS, 
 the Ministry of Agriculture and many  
 of the Feed Firms.                    </content>
