		<content>   I am flying over Swansea. People are
 walking into the Telecom Tower like   
 ants walking into a tall cardboard    
 box. Swansea Castle is boarded up so  
 you cannot go inside.Ladies are       
 walking out of big stores, chatting   
 and fussing about what they have      
 bought; they look like ladybirds in   
 their smart dresses.                  
   I am now coming into Morriston.     
 There are lots of roads; they remind  
 me of grey ribbons twisting and       
 turning all over the place. The cars  
 look like coloured insects on wheels. 
 I can now see the DVLC. The building  
 looks very smart standing in the      
 middle of all the grey ribbons. There 
 are lots of people going in and out.  
   I am now over Ynystawe School. The  
 children are in lines walking into    
 their classrooms,like rows of ants    
 marching.                             </content>
