		<content>{ A typical Saturday in my house}      
                                       
 On Saturday mornings I am awakened by 
 my brother. He gets up at 6 o'clock to
 milk the cows. After breakfast Dad    
 comes in. At about 10 o'clock Mum gets
 up and starts to cook the dinner. At  
 this time I am usually playing with my
 friends, then at 12 o'clock I come    
 back in for dinner.Dad likes to watch 
 Saturday Sport on television, so he   
 eats his dinner in the living room.   
    After doing the washing up, we all 
 watch television. After tea, I feed   
 our cats which live in the farm       
 buildings.                            
    All the family watches television  
 together until bedtime.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
