		<content> DURING THE LAST 20 YEARS MANY         
 NEWCOMERS HAVE MOVED INTO THE AREA    
 HENCE THERE ARE A GREAT VARIETY OF    
 ACCENTS SPOKEN BUT STANDARD ENGLISH IS
 PREDOMINANT. THE ONLY WELSH SPOKEN IS 
 BY INCOMERS, APPROXIMATELY TWO        
 HOUSEHOLDS. THERE IS NO STRONGLY      
 DEFINED ACCENT, NO DIALECT SPOKEN     
 ALTHOUGH THE DUAL INFLUENCES OF THE   
 HEREFORDSHIRE AND WELSH ACCENTS ARE   
 DISCERNIBLE. THE SOFT ROLLING 'R'     
 FAMILIAR IN HEREFORDSHIRE DIALECT IS  
 HEARD AND SING-SONG WELSH INFLEXION IS
 EVIDENT. MANY OLD FARMING TERMS ARE   
 STILL IN USE ALTHOUGH ON THE WANE; THE
 MOST COMMON BEING:- FOLLET - LOFT     
 (POSSIBLY A CORRUPTION OF THE WELSH   
 TAFLOD), GLAT - A HOLE IN A HEDGE,    
 BUDGE - TO FILL A GAP, POO-EY, POO-EY 
 - TO CALL COWS. PITCH IS USED TO      
 DESCRIBE A SHORT STEEP HILL           
 E.G.MYNACHDY PITCH.                   </content>
