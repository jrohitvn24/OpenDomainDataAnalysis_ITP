		<content>{View from Ferryside Cemetery.}I can   
 see the headland quite clearly and the
 ruins of Llansteffan castle. To the   
 right of the castle I could see three 
 tall arches and a grey mansion with   
 three white pillars. Then I saw a big 
 deciduas and pine forest and some     
 green fields with fresian cows in     
 them. Bellow the fields was the       
 coastal village of Llansteffan. Above 
 Llansteffan  a thin line of deciduas  
 woodland going horizontaly and above  
 that are some green fields with black 
 sheep in them. Futher to the right I  
 could see clearly a brown ploughed    
 field and electricity wires.          
     I could see the sgiji mud, the    
 blue river and the marsh. I could see 
 the sandbanks as well.                
     I could see the long  jeti, two   
 chapels and bungalows.
