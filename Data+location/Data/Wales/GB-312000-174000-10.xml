 Then they go to have lunch at one     
 o'clock and wait for a call.When we   
 went to visit them they were called   
 out on two fires! When they came back 
 they were black, wet and filthy.      
 Firemen at Ely work from 9am to 6pm   
 or 6pm to 9am. A fire station can     
 never shut down. They have very long  
 water hoses, they are six to eight    
 foot long. Each fire engine has four  
 ladders, seven hoses and an extra     
 engine for pumping foam.
