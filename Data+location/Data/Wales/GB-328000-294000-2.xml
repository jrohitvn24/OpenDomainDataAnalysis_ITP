		<title>02Local history: Cordon Hill</title>
		<content>   Corndon is a conical hill formed    
 by an intrusion of dolerite into the  
 ordovician shales and rising to a     
 height of{513m}above sea level.       
   There are 6 round cairns on the     
 hill , (at SO30449666; SO306096;      
 SO30909676 ; SO30949680; SO30869632;  
  and SO30539608 ) with two further    
 examples on the lower slopes at       
 ( SO29999670 &amp; SO30409753 ). These    
 cairns are probably of Bronze Age     
 date. Although several of them appear 
 to have opened at some time , there   
 are no records of burials found nor   
 any grave goods.                      
   To the North of Corndon and on its  
 lowest slopes a{stone circle}, the    
 Whetstones , stood all traces were    
 finally removed by gun powder in 1860.
