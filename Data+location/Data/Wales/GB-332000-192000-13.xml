<title>13The Ponthir Domesday Tapestry</title>
<content>

After watching a programme about Domesday Project by Michael Wood in 1986, I contacted Mr Beardmore the then Headmaster and asked if the children of Ponthir School could do a project.&lt;br />&lt;br />We decided to do a Tapestry of life in the village at that time. The children did their own drawings of the Village, either showing buildings or activities that they took part in, their drawings were then transfered onto Tapestry material and sewn with wools using straight stitch.&lt;br />&lt;br />Each tapestry square measuered about 12 inches which were machined together by me. There were 40 squares in all.&lt;br />&lt;br />It took almost a whole school year to complete, and as you can see from the photgraph taken at the time the children were very proud of their efforts.&lt;br />&lt;br />I know that the Tapestry was displayed in the school until a few years ago.   &lt;br />
