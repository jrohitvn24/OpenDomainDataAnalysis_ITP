		<content>    My name is Jason Leighton and I    
 live at {Blackhills.}I go to {        
{Bishopston Comprehensive School}and   
 I'm in the second year. It is a nice  
 school and everybody's very friendly. 
 Where I live there are lots of        
 beautiful flowers and countryside. The
 people of 1985 are facing drugs,      
 unemployment, and other problems. The 
 nearest place to where I live is {    
{Bishopston.}It is a nice small village
 with a couple of shops but it's       
 getting bigger all the time.          
 Technology is now a big thing and     
 nearly everybody has a computer. By   
 2000 technology will be taking over.  
 It is very nice around here. A good   
 home, a good school and really        
 friendly people. I hope this will go  
 on for a long time to come.
