		<title>01VALE OF GLAMORGAN AREA</title>
		<content> The area covered by this part of the  
 survey is within 10 miles of the City 
 of{Cardiff}between 2 major roads and  
 yet it retains a very{rural}atmosphere
 with narrow country lanes and very few
 ammenities. It can be inferred from   
 looking at the area as a whole thatto 
 live in this area without access to   
 transport with or without a           
 family,young or old would be very     
 difficult. The major part of this area
 to the west is dominated by{Dyffryn   
{House}and grounds. This complex is    
 under threat of closure due to        
 cutbacks in local government spending 
 and as it was bequeathed to{Glamorgan}
 as a whole is affected by 3 separate  
 counties' financial difficulties.     
 The eastern fringe, by contrast, has  
 been altered slightly more by the     
 latter half of the 20th century (golf 
 club and quarries).                   </content>
