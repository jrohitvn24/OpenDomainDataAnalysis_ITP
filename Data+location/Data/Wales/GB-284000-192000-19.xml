		<content> In{Nantyffyllon}we have a wide choice 
 of{amenities}but most of them are for 
 older children and grown ups. The old 
 library is where lots of activities   
 take place:_ disco on Wednesday and   
 Friday: bingo Monday, Thursday and    
 Saturday: snooker,weight lifting and  
 dancing. At my school the             
 brownies meet on Tuesday evenings and 
 cubs on Friday evenings. There are two
 Rugby and football clubs where boys   
 can train. There are many pubs and    
 clubs where there are darts and       
 skittles which keep our parents busy  
 in the nights. There is a gardening   
 club near the Llynfi river. In Trinity
 chapel there is Sunday school and band
 of hope which is fun. There is a      
 B.M.X. track on a local mountain.     
 There is also jazz band in the area   
 where children can go in the evenings.
