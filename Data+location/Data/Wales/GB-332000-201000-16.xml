 opened in 1892 and closed in 1985.It  
 was attended by children from         
 Glascoed,Coed_y_paen,Monkswood and    
 Little Mill.                          
 Until 1971 there were just two classes
 in the school _ Juniors were taught by
 the Headmaster and Infants by a lady  
 teacher.During the following ten years
 three demountable classrooms were     
 erected to cope with the growing      
 number of pupils,and two more         
 teachers joined the staff.            
 End of term concerts and sports days  
 were always well attended by parents. 
 The P.T.A.organised social events, and
 raised funds to buy extra equipment,  
 school_computer,video and T.V. etc.   
 In 1984/5 a new school was built in   
 Usk and the Education Authority       
 decided to close down Glascoed school 
 and transport the children to Usk.    </content>
