{Aurochs} Footprints thought to belong 
 to the Aurochs, a bison_like animal   
 have been found at Borth, and a       
 skeleton discovered some fifteen years
 ago.                                  
{Caer Allt Goch}(SN64118837) A small   
 hill fort/settlement of 0.8 hectares  
 with only one entrance to the east. It
 is thought to be part of a system of  
 forts or settlements.                 
{Pantyfedwen} A beautiful building     
 built in 1870 as the Borth Hydropathic
 Establishment by Thomas Savin when he 
 brought the railway to Borth. It      
 became the Grand Hotel but was bought 
 and presented to the Urdd by D.J.James
 in 1947 and calledd Pantyfedwen.      
 Tragically, its upkeep was too much,  
 it was sold and, owing to its state of
 disrepair was demolished in 1979.     </content>
