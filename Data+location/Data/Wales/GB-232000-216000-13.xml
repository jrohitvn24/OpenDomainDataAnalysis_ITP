		<content> Walking down a quiet 180 metres long  
 farm track near the southern boundary 
 of our block we saw many colourful    
 wild flowers.The most common flower   
 was the foxglove,the tallest found    
 measured 181cm.The hawthorn trees were
 in full flower and very attractive.   
 The gorse bushes were covered in      
 yellow flowers and very popular with  
 the bees.As the hedges were overgrown 
 the wild rose flowers were numerous   
 and pink and white in colour.Another  
 popular plant was the hawkweed with   
 its long tough stem.The delicate      
 speedwell peeped among the grass,while
 the stonecrop made splashes of yellow.
 In our part of the world the pink     
 campion is very common and we saw many
 on our walk.Due to a late spring      
 there were still a few brave bluebells
 to be seen however most had gone to   
 seed.                                 </content>
