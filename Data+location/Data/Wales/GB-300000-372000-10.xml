{THE THUNDERSTORM.                     
    ONE TUESDAY NIGHT IN APRIL 1984 A  
 SEVERE STORM HIT THE AREA.BEFORE THE  
 STORM WE HAD INSTALLED A SHED FULL OF 
 CHICKENS,AND ON THAT NIGHT, MOST OF   
 THE CHICKENS WERE KILLED.WE HAD ABOUT 
 50 SURVIVING CHICKENS OUT OF A TOTAL  
 OF 1,000.NO ONE KNOWS WHAT ACTUALLY   
 HAPPENED.SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY HAD 
 BEEN ELECTROCUTED,HAD DIED OF         
 FRIGHT,OR HAD BEEN SUFFOCATED.WE WILL 
 PROBABLY NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.    
{DUTCH ELM DISEASE.}                   
 ONE MONDAY WHEN WE CAME BACK TO SCHOOL
 THE SCHOOL ELM TREE(WHICH WAS ABOUT   
 155yrs.OLD)HAD BEEN CUT DOWN BECAUSE  
 OF{DUTCH ELM DISEASE.}I WAS VERY SORRY
 THAT IT HAD TO BE CUT DOWN.WE USED TO 
 PLAY IN IT AND HANG ON THE            
 BRANCHES.NOW ALL WE HAVE LEFT IS THE  
 TREE STUMP.                           </content>
