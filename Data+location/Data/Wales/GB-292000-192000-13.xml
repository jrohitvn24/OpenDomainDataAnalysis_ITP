		<content> NANT-Y-MOEL R.F.C. STARTED IN 1885/86 
 SEASON. THEY USED TO HAVE TWO TEAMS,  
 ONE WAS NANT-Y-MOEL SENIOR XV AND THE 
 YOUTH SIDE WAS CALLED NANT-Y-MOEL     
 WHITE STARS. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN      
 GROUND, STAND AND CAR PARK.  MANY     
 YEARS AGO THE YOUTH SIDE DISBANDED.   
 IT WAS RESTARTED AGAIN IN 1979 AND WAS
 CALLED NANT-Y-MOEL YOUTH.  THIS YEAR  
 IS NANT-Y-MOEL CENTENTARY, THE YOUTH  
 SIDE IS GOING BACK TO THE NAME        
 NANT-Y-MOEL WHITE STARS, FOR THIS     
 REASON ONLY.                          
      NANT-Y-MOEL STARTED A FEW YEARS  
 AFTER THEIR GREAT RIVALS OGMORE VALE. 
 THERE IS GREAT RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM.  
 THEY PLAY FOR THEIR CUP ANNUALLY      
 DONATED BY THE FAMILY OF A MAN WHO    
 DIED IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  FOR THE    
 FIRST FEW YEARS NANT-Y-MOEL WON THE   
 CUP BUT MORE RECENTLY OGMORE VALE HAVE
 GAINED SUPERIORITY.                   </content>
