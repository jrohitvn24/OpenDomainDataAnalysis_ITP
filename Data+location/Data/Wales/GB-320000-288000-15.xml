 shown by local people.The first year  
 they had in the region of 25 members.

 This year it is around 50.In 1984 they
 played 17 friendly games, of which 11 
 were won against clubs like Abermule, 
 Churchstoke,Clun,Meifod and a lot of  
 other local clubs.This year there are 
 18 friendlies but the weather is not  
 very kind and 2 games have been       
 cancelled.There is also a 200 club    
 (200 people pay Â£10 a year,and have   
 their names put into a monthly draw)
