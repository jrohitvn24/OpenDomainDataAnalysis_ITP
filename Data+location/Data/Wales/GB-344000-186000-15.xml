		<title>15The Severnaires Jazz Band</title>
		<content> This marching 'Jazz' band was formed  
 about nine years ago. I joined a year 
 ago and play the 'Kazoo' in the fourth
 rank. We have two side drums, one bass
 drum, three tambourines and one       
 cymbal. This is the Drum Court. We    
 march in six ranks and there are two  
 mace bearers.                         
    We meet every Monday and Wednesday 
 at Sandy Lane Infants School and pay  
 20p a week to help to pay for new     
 instruments and uniforms,etc.         
    The Drum Court wear grey uniforms  
 with pink hats and the ranks wear pink
 uniforms with grey hats.              
    I enjoy being a member of this jazz
 band because I love marching and      
 parading to the music of the band.
