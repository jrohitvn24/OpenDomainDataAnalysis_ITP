		<content> Darland School is an 11-16 mixed      
 comprehensive school. At 16+ pupils   
 can continue their education in Yale  
 Sixth Form College, Wrexham, or at the
 North East Wales Institute, Plas Coch,
 Wrexham.                              
                                       
 The school is made up of two blocks.  
 The first block (Allington-Horsley)   
 was built in 1958.  The first         
 headmaster ,Mr Bellis, was with the   
 school from 1958 until 1977.  The     
 school first opened with 200 pupils   
 and 8 teachers.                       
                                       
 Originally the Assembly Hall doubled  
 as a gym but in 1972 the second block 
 (Burton-Trevalyn) and a gym were      
 constructed.  In 1972 there was an    
 increase in pupils and staff when the 
 school changed from being a secondary 
 modern school to a comprehensive.     </content>
