		<content>  My name is Andrew and I live on a big
 housing estate called the Gurnos.My   
 teacher told us that there are about  
 5000 people living here.The children  
 in my class set out to find how people
 spend their spare time.We started with
 the children.In our school there is   
 a cub troop and a brownie troop.There 
 is also a disco sometimes.I think     
 these should be held every week.There 
 is a community centre on the estate   
 with judo and keep fit classes.They   
 have just started building a BMX track
 which will be good.Near our estate is 
 Cyfarthfa Park where there are play-  
 grounds and there is a lake where you 
 can go fishing.The playgrounds on the 
 estate have been vandalised.My hobbies
 are rollerskating &amp; reading.I have to 
 go to Merthyr to go to the rollerdisco
 which is great fun.I also have to     
 travel to Merthyr to go to a library. </content>
