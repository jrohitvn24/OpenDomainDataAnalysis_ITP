		<content> Our group found out how children like 
 to spend their{recreational}time.By   
 intreviewing children of different    
 ages we were able to find:-           
 Pass the parcel,Musical statues were  
 amoungst the favourites,most popular  
 was{Fire ball.}You have as many people
 as you like in a circle who throw a   
 ball to one another.If someone drops  
 the ball they have to run around the  
 circle and the people who are left    
 have got to throw the ball to         
 eachother until the last person to    
 have it tamps out the person who      
 dropped the ball if they are still    
 running.If they do then the person who
 was running is out.                   
   The most popular school party is on 
 Halloween because the children have a 
 chance to wear{costumes}and win a     
 prize.
