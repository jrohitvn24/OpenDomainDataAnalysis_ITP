		<content> Although there is no major cultural   
 centre within the area surveyed,the   
 inhabitants are within easy travelling
 distance of several theatre and cinema
 complexes.People interviewed did not  
 show a preference between the centres 
 at Mold and Chester but based their   
 choice on the actual production or    
 film being shown.At the time of       
 writing this account the following    
 films are being shown:-Watership Down 
 at Mold's Theatre Clwyd and A Passage 
 to India at Chester's ABC.For         
 theatre-goers the choice is between   
 Ballet Rambert and Hair at Mold or The
 Importance of Being Ernest at         
 Chester's Gateway Theatre. Although   
 both of these are well  patronised by 
 the public,they are under constant    
 financial pressure to maintain high   
 standards of production.
