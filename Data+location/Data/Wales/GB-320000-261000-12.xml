		<content> THE PARK ROAD BAPTIST CHAPEL WAS BUILT
 IN 1869. ATTACHED IS THE BURIAL GROUND
 WITH APPROXIMATELY 45 GRAVES. THE     
 CHAPEL ONCE HAD A SIGNIFICANT         
 MEMBERSHIP AND IN 1923 THIS TOTALLED  
 183.  HOWEVER BY 1985 THERE WAS A VERY
 NOTICEABLE DECLINE WITH A MERE TOTAL  
 OF 9 MEMBERS AND 6 CHILDREN.THE FALL  
 IN MEMBERSHIP DURING THE YEARS MEANT  
 THAT IT COULD NO LONGER FINANCIALLY   
 SUPPORT A MINISTER. TWO OTHER CHAPELS 
 IN SURROUNDING AREAS FACED THE SAME   
 PREDICAMENT SO THEY ALL SHARED ONE    
 MINISTER. TO DATE THE SITUATION HAS   
 FURTHER DETERIORATED AND HAS BECOME   
 DEPENDANT ON LAY PREACHERS TO CONDUCT 
 THE SERVICES HELD EVERY OTHER SUNDAY. 
 OTHER PEOPLE ATTEND THE ESTABLISHED   
 CHURCH - THE CHURCH OF WALES.
