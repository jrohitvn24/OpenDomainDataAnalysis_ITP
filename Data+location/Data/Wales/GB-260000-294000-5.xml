		<content>    Holiday accommodation dominates the
 village so much so that a local       
 councillor managed to total the number
 of permanently resided in homes       
 fronting on to Copperhill Street,the  
 main street running inland from the   
 village centre,on his fingers!        
    The large terraced houses running  
 parallel to the narrow coastal strip  
 have been almost totally converted    
 into holiday flats.                   
    Behind the busy sea front the quiet
 streets and squares contain rows of   
 small 19th century terraced houses.   
 Many have been purchased by people    
 from outside the area as holiday homes
 and in many cases are available for   
 weekly rental.                        
    Traditional bed and breakfast      
 accommodation at one of the few guest 
 houses or farms is also available.
