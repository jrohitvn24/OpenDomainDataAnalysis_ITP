		<title>09FARM LIFE IN LLANBISTER</title>
		<content> The average day starts at around 8am, 
 after breakfast. The chickens are fed 
 and are put out onto grass for the    
 day, some of these birds provide eggs,
 others are for the table.Cows are     
 brought into the shed to milk for the 
 house and are then put out to grass.  
 mucking out is also a daily chore,the 
 manure is kept to help fertilize the  
 fields.                               
    In summer hay or silage making     
 takes up most of the time,the aim     
 being to store enough feed to carry   
 the stock through the winter.         
   During the winter the suckling of   
 calves and the feeding of all stock is
 an every day routine.They are fed on  
 hay, silage or oat straw.Growing stock
 are given cube cake.                  
    Spare time is taken up maintaining 
 hedges and fences,machinery and       
 buildings.                            </content>
