		<title>15FARMING AROUND AMMANFORD</title>
		<content>  Farming is very successful in the    
 study area. Most farms are dairy      
 units, allowing their herds to graze  
 on the valley bottom.                 
  The mild winters mean that cattle    
 need only be kept indoors for about 16
 weeks in winter. The animals are fed  
 on hay, silage and bought cake during 
 these months. (Although there are no  
 feed mills in this immediate area,    
 there are several found locally.)     
  The average herd is of 60 cattle,    
 with 40 milkers. The most popular     
 herds are Guernsey, Jersey, Friesian  
 or Dairy-Shorthorn cross.             
  The milk is mostly sold to a Co-op.  
 although several farmers still sell   
 and deliver their own green top milk. 
  Very few sheep are found in this     
 lowland area in summer but flocks are 
 tacked in winter. The largest mart is 
 at Carmarthen, about 18 miles away.   </content>
