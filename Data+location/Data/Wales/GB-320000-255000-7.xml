		<title>07A CHILD'S HOME IN GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> I live at Gladestry .My house is      
 called Little Wern Willa. It is also  
 called The Pitch. My house is old.My  
 house is partly modernized, because   
 it has a bathroom and electricity. It 
 is about 150 years old. My home is on 
 a farm. The farm buildings are very   
 close to the house.                   
 The house is made of stone. The roof  
 is made of slate. We have a new porch.
 Down stairs we have a pantry, a       
 living-room, a kitchen and a          
 bath-room. In our kitchen there is a  
 cooker, a phone, a washing machine and
 a food mixer. In the sitting-room     
 there is a colour television. There   
 are two bed-rooms. There is an inside 
 toilet which is in the bath-room. Our 
 house is heated by a Rayburn. We have 
 got a garage. We have got a car and   
 some farm vehicles.
