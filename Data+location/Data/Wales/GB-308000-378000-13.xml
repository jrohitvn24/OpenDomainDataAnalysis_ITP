		<content> The Liverpool Daily Post provides the 
 main source for local news.  It is    
 read regularly, in nearly half of the 
 homes.                                
 The paper is printed in Liverpool. and
 carries news of all events along the  
 North Wales coast.  Only Births,      
 Deaths, Marriages, notices are printed
 in the welsh language.                
 The Rhyl Journal, a weekly newspaper, 
 is even more popular with the people. 
 This provides stories and photographs 
 of events that are held in the area.  
 The sotories are written in Rhyl, but 
 the paper is printed in Oswestry on   
 Wednesday.  The new radio station from
 Mold, Radio Clwyd, is not very well   
 supported.  It iis mainly listened to 
 for its early morning news, traffic   
 and weather notices.  Radio Cymru, has
 a higher listening figure. the new    
 television channel is S.4.C.          </content>
