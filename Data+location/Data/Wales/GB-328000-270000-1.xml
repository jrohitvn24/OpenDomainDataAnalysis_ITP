		<content>      The area which we are studying is
 predominantly rural with a small town 
 in its centre. Around{Knighton}itself 
 there are a number of farms of small  
 acreages.The town lies in the{Teme    
{Valley} and the ground rises steeply  
 on both sides to {Panpuntan Hill}and {
{Kinsley Wood }on one side and{Garth   
{Hill}and the{Golf Course}on the other.
       The{River Teme}runs through the 
 valley and because of its meander has 
 left a few{ox-bow pools}between its   
 source and the town of Knighton.The   
 building of small factories has taken 
 place on the level bank of the river  
 which does not flood and no further   
 building can take place on the        
 remainder because it is liable to     
 flooding.
