		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF ABERDYFI</title>
		<content>   Aberdyfi is a comparatively modern  
 village.A report dated 1569 states    
 that there were only 2 or 3 houses in 
 the area.Fishing was the main         
 occupation with herring, salmon and   
 mackerel in plentiful supply.         
   During the 18th and 19th centuries  
 the village grew rapidly as a port.   
 Shipping and shipbuilding became a    
 major industry.Between 1840 and 1880  
 forty five ships were built in the    
 shipbuilding yards at Penhelig.       
   The coming of the railway in 1867   
 began the slow decline of Aberdyfi as 
 a port. The last boats to sail to and 
 from Aberdyfi were the s.s.Dora and   
 the s.s.Telephone.                    
   Today the former port area has been 
 redeveloped and the economy of the    
 village is completely dependent on the
 tourist industry.
