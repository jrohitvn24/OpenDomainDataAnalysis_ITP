		<content> Most people work on farms.There are   
 not many farm workers as there used to
 be because of modern machines. People 
 often work on the farms for part of   
 the year like potato picking and      
 sorting. A few people work for the    
 Forestry Commission.Most mothers work 
 or want to work. They might work in   
 shops in nearby towns like Knighton or
 Presteigne or perhaps in the trouser  
 factory in Knighton. Two mothers from 
 this school are nurses and one drives 
 a school bus. Fathers might be        
 builders and one is a printer and     
 another a lorry mechanic at           
 Llandrindod 20 miles away. Most work  
 on their own farms. Lots of young     
 people have to move away because there
 are not many really good jobs round   
 here. Sons will often grow up and take
 over the farm but it is hard for young
 men to find good jobs.                </content>
