		<title>18HOUSING IN PENLAN, SWANSEA</title>
		<content>   Nearly all the houses in Penlan were
 Council-built in the early 1950s. It  
 is part of a large, sprawling estate  
 with few amenities in it. Houses are a
 mixture of brick-built, steel and     
 highrise flats. By now, many are in   
 need of repair. Many houses are having
 new roofs fitted. Lots of the steel   
 houses are being rebuilt. Some have   
 been demolished and replaced by large 
 brick houses. Opposite these is new   
 'sheltered accommodation' for old     
 people who live in nice maisonettes.  
 Unfortunately, many children play     
 there and frighten the old people.    
 Over the last 5 years, all young      
 children have been moved out of the   
 highrise flats and as a result our    
 school has lost more than half its    
 children. Sadly, one of our boys fell 
 off scaffolding around one of these   
 buildings and was killed.             </content>
