		<content> Heliport.                             
 In early 1985 there opened a new      
 passenger service between Holyhead and
 Ireland.The idea was that businessmen 
 could have a faster link between      
 Dublin and London if they took air    
 transport from Dublin to Holyhead and 
 then by train to London.However ther  
 weren't enough passengers and the     
 venture was abandoned after only afew 
 months.                               
 The heliport and all its buildings    
 are still standing in the Holyhead    
 industrial estate.Ther is no sign that
 a new company will be taking up the   
 venture in the future.
