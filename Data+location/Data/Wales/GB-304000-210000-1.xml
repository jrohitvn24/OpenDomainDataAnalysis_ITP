		<title>01PONTSTICILL AND VAYNOR AREA</title>
		<content>{The villages of Pontsticill and Vaynor
 lie to the north of Merthyr Tydfil in 
 South Wales.The villages are situated 
 on the western side of the valley of  
 the Taf Fechan river itself dammed a  
 century ago to provide water for the  
 townspeople to the south. The land    
 above the valley is an old plateau    
 area which rises northwards to the    
 foot of the  Brecon Beacons a few     
 miles away.The plateau is mostly      
 covered by moorland which provides    
 rough grazing for sheep, although many
 of the valley slopes are planted with 
 coniferous trees.The reservoir        
 nowadays attracts tourists to the area
 with its facilities for fishing and   
 sailing.The Brecon Mountain Railway   
 operates steam trains in the summer   
 months from Pontsticill. The area lies
 almost entirely within the Brecon     
 Beacons National Park.                </content>
