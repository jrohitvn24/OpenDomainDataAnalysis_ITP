		<content> St. Bridget's was built between 1228  
 and 1232 and is 750 years old. It     
 was built of stone and during its     
 history has been enlarged and         
 renovated.                            
 The most beautiful item in the church 
 is a 500 year old cape called a       
 'Cope'.It is wine coloured velvet and 
  is decorated with silk patterned     
 pictures and embroidery.              
 The stone 'Morgan's Tomb' is carved   
 with the likenesses of the mother,    
 father, four brothers and four sisters
 who are buried there. Other ancient   
 items include the 750 year old font,  
 a stone altar and a box pew. There are
 the remains of a rood screen which    
 would have been taken down during the 
 reign of Edward VI. Two stoops are set
 into the walls near the altar and in  
 the porch.                            
                                       </content>
