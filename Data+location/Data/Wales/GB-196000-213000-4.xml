		<content> The training of sheep-dogs has become 
 popular through the television        
 programme, 'One Man and his Dog', when
 the skill of farmer and dog is        
 combined.     This is the hobby of    
 W.T.DAVIES of Uzmaston Farm, Welsh    
 President of the International Sheep -
 dog Society (1983-6), who also carves 
 his shepherd's crooks.                
 Young Farmers Clubs have the motto    
 'Good Farmers-Good Countrymen-Good    
 Citizens' and meet weekly for members 
 of 25 years and under. Classes are    
 provided in Stock Judging, Folk       
 Dancing, Home Economics,Drama and     
 Public Speaking.          A Rally of  
 Competitions is held in May when money
 is raised for charity and exchange    
 visits. Interest in physical fitness  
 induces local walkers, joggers and    
 runners to enjoy our lanes. A caravan 
 site for tourists exists.             </content>
