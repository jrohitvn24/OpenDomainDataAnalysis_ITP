		<content> While we were walking I heard somebody
 say"Marged is keeping up very well."  
 When we had walked five miles we      
 stopped outside the Fox and Hounds to 
 have something to eat.When we reached 
 Bwlch-y-groes square I was very tired 
 but it was worth the journey.The pain 
 first started when I was walking past 
 Llyn Ffynonne.It stopped when I had   
 walked on about half a mile.Another   
 time when I had pain was when we were 
 walking up the hill next to the Fox   
 and Hounds.It was as if it would never
 end.That night my parents and I went  
 out to have a Chinese meal in Cardigan
 because it was my father's birthday   
 and as a reward for our long walk.Now 
 that the sponsors' money has all been 
 collected I am very happy to be able  
 to report that over Â£322 has been paid
 into the bank.A very good day's work!
