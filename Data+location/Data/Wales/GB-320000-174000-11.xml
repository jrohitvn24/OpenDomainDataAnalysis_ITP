		<title>11Welsh National Opera Project</title>
		<content> The Opera D.I.Y. Project was set up by
 the Education Directo at the Welsh    
 National Opera.The main sponsors are  
 Allied Steel and Wire.Four community  
 arts workers were brought in to the   
 Welsh National Opera team; a writer,a 
 designer,a composer,a dancer and      
 combined with the Rubicon Dance Centre
 (a community dance organisation).The  
 team were employed to develop skills  
 and interest in the arts with schools 
 and community groups in our Cardiff   
 South area.First part culminated in a 
 Carnival and Open Day where the       
 different factions performend for each
 other.Over the Winter of  1985/86 a   
 Community Opera will be written by the
 writer and composer based on the work 
 done in the area during the Summer    
 term 1985 and will be performed by the
 children and adults of the area       
 somewhere in Splott in July 1986.     </content>
