		<title>13RELIGION-ST GARMON'S WELL</title>
		<content> St Garmon's well is to be found in a  
 field belonging to Ty Coch farm.St    
 Garmon when he came here in about 450 
 AD used water from the well to baptise
 infant children.Later the water was   
 taken to the font in St Garmon's      
 church.It is believed that St Garmon's
 planted a yew tree beside his well.One
 day some children were trying to catch
 a rabbit and the rabbit ran into the  
 yew tree so the children set it on    
 fire to try and smoke the rabbit out  
 but unforunatly they didn't realise   
 that was the yew tree that St Garmon's
 planted to make a prayer desk out of  
 it.Today the well is neglected but    
 still contains water.
