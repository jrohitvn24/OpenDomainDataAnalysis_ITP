		<title>17SHOPPING IN LOWER PENARTH</title>
		<content> There are about{2112 dwellings,4 local
{shops,one a Post Office,one a Craft   
 shop.These shops are used by the local
 people for daily and weekly shopping. 
 Most residents shop weekly at{super_  
{markets}on the outskirts of Penarth,  
 Barry or Cardiff,where car parks are  
 provided.Some shop in the Town where  
 there is a lack of{off_street parking.
 Very few use Public Transport or walk!
 A proposal to build a{Superstore}Post_
 Office,{Community Hall}by a Private   
 Company was rejected by the Council,  
 residents also objected.Their attitude
 was that a superstore near Cosmeston  
 would change the character of the area
 Planning for a shop and hall on the   
 site of a disused concrete works has  
 been granted.This would be useful for 
 residents and particularly old people.
 There is little trading apart from a  
{rural craftshop}used by visitors.     </content>
