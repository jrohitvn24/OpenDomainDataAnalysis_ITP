		<title>06A Description of the area</title>
		<content> The people living in the area are,in  
 the majority,Welsh_speaking;although, 
 in 1968,an influx of about 1000 miners
 from Durham did create special        
 problems in the local schools.These   
 problems were,however,overcome by the 
 creation of "Welsh for Learners"      
 courses;these were so successful that,
 by now,the children and grand_children
 are fluent in the Welsh language.     
  The village of Pontyberem can boast  
 how it has the largest and best_equip-
 ped primary school in the county of   
 Dyfed,for until 1983 its buildings    
 housed the local secondary school     
 which,in that year,was disbanded under
 the Education's scheme for the        
 re_organisation of education in the   
 valley (there are now only 2          
 comprehensive schools whereas there   
 were 2 high_schools and 1 grammar     
 school).          (cont next page)    </content>
