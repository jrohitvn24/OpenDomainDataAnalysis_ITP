		<content> In 1930 the Red and White began its   
 service in the Chepstow area.Today in 
 Chepstow they have 24 buses.In        
 Cinderford they have 7 buses and in   
 Ross they have 12.Altogether this     
 totals 43 buses.The company also have 
 37 double deck buses.The company runs 
 services all over the surrounding area
 People think bus fares are too high   
 but the cost of keeping a fleet of    
 buses on the road is very high.A      
 single bus costs Â£50,000 to buy and   
 this is in addition to repair bills   
 and staff wages.Bus services operate  
 between 06.30 and 23.00 on Weekdays   
 and 12.00 and 23.30 on Sundays.       
 Most of the buses are one man operated
 That is the driver collects fares as  
 well as driving the bus.Drivers work  
 two alternate shifts from 06.00 to    
 15.00 and from 15.00 to 12.00.
