		<content> The village needs a hall as a meeting 
 place.Preasure is mounting for tennis 
 courts and better recreational        
 facilities.To date,an area has been   
 leveled in preparation,but further    
 work needs to be done.Parc Elin Mair  
 has been reclaimed from marshland with
 benches and a cricket square.The      
 village lacks a social focal          
 point.Improvements have been made to  
 the square but elderly locals do not  
 like the high pavements provided.It   
 was suggested that a seat be located  
 on some rough ground on the crossroads
 but the land owner refused permission.
 Recently a Brownie Pack has been      
 formed meeting in the local           
 school.Similarly a pre-school         
 playgroup funded by parents meets     
 there.
