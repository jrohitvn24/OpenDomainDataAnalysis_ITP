		<title>11ABERGELE TOWN LIBRARY</title>
		<content> The new library, opened in 1973, by   
 the County Council, replaced one which
 had been housed in a local shop.      
 There are two full time and 2 part    
 time library assistants.  The         
 Librarian is Mr. B. Davies from       
 Denbigh.  Clwyd County Library Service
 has 10,000,000 books.  18,000 are held
 at Abergele coded on the Dewey decimal
 system, but others are obtainable from
 other branches and the Micro-fische   
 Catalogue displays on-screen the      
 County's book stock.  Membership is   
 open to everyone and books may be     
 borrowed for two weeks normally.  If  
 books are overdue the borrower incurs 
 a small cash fine.  Wednesday is the  
 quietest day and Friday is the busiest
 Opening times:  10 am-7 pm Monday to  
 Friday; 10am-1pm Thursday; Saturday,  
 Sunday closed.  Children's activites  
 are arranged during school holidays.  </content>
