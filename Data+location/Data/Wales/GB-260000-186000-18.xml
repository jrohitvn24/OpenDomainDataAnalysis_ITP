		<title>18Oystermouth Castle</title>
		<content>   Oystermouth Castle was first built  
 of wood around the year 1100 by the   
 Normans. Later in the 13th Century it 
 was rebuilt of local stone.           
                                       
   As you enter the Castle you notice  
 that it is built on a hill so that the
 people who lived in it could see if   
 any enemies were coming. Today, from  
 the ruins you can still see right     
 round Swansea Bay as far as the Pier  
 and the Lighthouse on Mumbles Head.   
                                       
   When we visited the Castle we       
 entered through the Gatehouse and saw 
 the "Murder Hole" through which the   
 defenders threw missiles at their     
 attackers. We explored the keep,      
 guard-room, White Lady's Chamber,     
 Chapel,kitchens and down the spiral   
 steps to the dungeons.
