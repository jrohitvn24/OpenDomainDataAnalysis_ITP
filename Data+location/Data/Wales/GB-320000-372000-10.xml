		<content> I live in Flint and it is very boring.
 It has quite a few shops, two markets 
 and a leisure centre, but none of     
 these are near where I live. There is 
 a derelict castle and a park in Flint 
 as well.                              
                                       
 The leisure centre is open every day  
 of the week until 10 pm, but you can  
 only go swimming at the weekend until 
 5 pm. In the leisure centre you can do
 lots of things like badminton, squash,
 table tennis, swimming or you can go  
 into the trimnasium. If you buy a     
 "Fairplay" ticket for Â£1.50 you can do
 all these things free until 5 pm all  
 week. My friends and I often go to the
 leisure centre, but apart from that   
 Flint is very boring.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
