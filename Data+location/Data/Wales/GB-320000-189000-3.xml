		<content>  Harold Jones is one of Crosskeys'    
 most famous sons. Born in 1900, Harold
 worked in the Risca pit from 13 until 
 his retirement in 1965. He was a local
 Labour Councillor and Compensation    
 Secretary for the N.U.M. He has been a
 tireless worker in the community and  
 even at 85 is active, running a Senior
 Citizens' Club which he set up.       
  One of Harold's most memorable       
 achievements was the establishment in 
 1928 of an unemployed men's           
 educational group. During 1928-1929   
 Oxford City "adopted" Risca and, using
 the unemployed group, established an  
 educational settlement. Key figures   
 involved were Lady Tweedsmuir (wife   
 of John Buchan),and the philosopher C.
 M. Joad, the then Master of Balliol   
 College. The settlement became "Oxford
 House", which still runs as an Adult  
 Education Centre.                     </content>
