		<content> There are many farms dotted around the
 area, ranging from the upland farms to
 the lowland farms on the banks of the 
 Teifi. Most are dairy farms, although 
 lately a few farmers have changed to  
 meat producing units. Most of the high
 ground has now been cultivated and is 
 used for sheep and cattle grazing.
