		<title>08ABERTHIN VILLAGE_HISTORY</title>
		<content>   Aberthin is situated roughly one    
 mile north of Cowbridge, in the parish
 of Llanblethian. it is set in a       
 picturesque steep-sided valley to the 
 north of Stalling Down .              
   Aberthin is  first mentioned in the 
 book of Llandaff, where it is called  
 "Ebirthum". Whether it was a monastic 
 grange is however, open to            
 speculation. When the Normans         
 conquered Taly-farn, they created the 
 sub-manor of Llanquian, and it is     
 likely that Aberthin was the village  
 of that sub-manor.                    
   One of the earliest Methodist       
 societies in Wales was established  at
 a farm house in the village in 1746.  
   During the 18th century, Stalling   
 Down was the venue of Cowbridge races.
 A greater crowd-puller than the races 
 was the occasional hanging which took 
 place on the downs.{( cont. P.9).}    </content>
