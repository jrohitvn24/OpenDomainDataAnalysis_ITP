		<title>10LLANSTEFFAN AREA: WORK</title>
		<content> The present very high unemployment    
 rate is not reflected in Llansteffan  
 and Llanybri. Comparatively few people
 are out of work at present, the       
 majority being school-leavers.        
 Although farming is the biggest and   
 most important industry, relatively   
 few people are actually engaged in it 
 directly. The farms, shops, post      
 offices, pubs, are all worked by the  
 families owning or renting them and   
 employ hardly any other workers.      
 Tourism offers some part-time work and
 Coomb Cheshire Home at Llangynog      
 employs a few people. Nearly everyone 
 else works in Carmarthen, in shops,   
 offices, hospitals, schools, the milk 
 factory, construction and so on; and  
 some go further afield. There are     
 quite a lot of retired people here and
 many are active in the community in   
 voluntary work.                       </content>
