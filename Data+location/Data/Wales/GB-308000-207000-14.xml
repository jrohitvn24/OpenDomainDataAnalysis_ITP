		<title>14RHYMNEY HOUSING-VALLEYSCAPE</title>
		<content> The housing in Rhymney,built mainly at
 the turn of the century,is fairly     
 typical of the valleys of South Wales.
   Most houses are terraced properties,
 which are owner occupied or council-  
 owned dwellings,although there are a  
 number of semi- detached houses and   
 an even smaller number of detached    
 houses.                               
   The houses themselves are made      
  either of red bricks with tiled roofs
 as in the case of the modern dwellings
 or as in older pre war housing mainly 
 of pennant sandstone and Welsh slate  
 roofs.                                
   The style of building is consistent 
 with Welsh valley towns.First houses  
 were built entirely of pennant then   
 yellow or red brick was used for      
 chimneys then Quoins and finally as   
 surrounds for doors and windows form- 
 ing the typical valley terraced house.</content>
