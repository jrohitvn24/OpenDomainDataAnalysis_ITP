  Most of the big employers in the     
 Cynon Valley are situated outside our 
 survey area.However,there are a number
 of smaller factories.One quite unique 
 factory is the Cambrian Lamp Works at 
 Robertstown.Although coal mining in   
 the valley has virtually disappeared  
 they still produce the famous {       
{Cambrian Flame Safety Lamps.}They are 
 still an essential piece of pit       
 equipment because they can detect the 
 presence of methane gas.The lamps are 
 also used on ships and in tunnels to  
 determine the presence of sufficient  
 oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.As no
 other device has yet been invented to 
 measure all three,the future of the   
 miner's safety lamp looks secure and  
 the Cambrian works is likely to be a  
 feature of Aberdare for many years.
