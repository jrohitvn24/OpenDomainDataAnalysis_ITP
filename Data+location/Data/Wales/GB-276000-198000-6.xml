		<title>06   OUR SCHOOL COOK.</title>
		<content>          Mrs Thomas is our school cook
                                       
 and she has been working in Tonna for 
 9 years.She worked for a year in the  
 old Tonna Junior School and she said  
 that she had more room there and      
 enjoyed it.                           
         To be a cook Mrs Thomas had to
 pass the City of Guilds exam.She      
 starts work at 8 o'clock and finishes 
 at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.She has 
 two people who help.They are Mrs      
 Beynon and Mrs Jones.                 
          Mrs Thomas thinks that the   
 type of meal has changed greatly,     
 because now we have a choice of menu. 
 They get their vegetables,fish and    
 sausage from Swansea;Groceries from   
 Cardiff and Meat from Bridgend.       
        A school meal today costs 65   
 pence which includes a sweet course   
 and a drink.                          </content>
