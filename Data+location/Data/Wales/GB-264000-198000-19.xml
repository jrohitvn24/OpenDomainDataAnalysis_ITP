		<content> comfortable place. Fifteen hundred    
 people now work at the hospital.      
  Many new buildings are being         
 constructed to make the hospital      
 bigger and better. The new buildings  
 will include a theatre, a casualty    
 ward and rooms for occupational       
 therapy and physiotherapy.            
  The new casualty ward will open in   
 November, 1985. Some people are upset 
 because there are plans to close the  
 casualty ward at Singleton Hospital,  
 Swansea which will mean many people   
 wil have much further to go for       
 treatment. The concern of local people
 has featured heavily in the newspaper.
  Each year the hospital has a carnival
 to raise money to make life for the   
 patients more comfortable. This year  
 they had a fete instead. Next year    
 they will have a carnival again       
 because the fete was less successful. </content>
