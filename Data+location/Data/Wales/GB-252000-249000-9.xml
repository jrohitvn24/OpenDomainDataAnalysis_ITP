		<title>09Cribyn School.</title>
		<content> Cribyn school is a small school.It    
 has three classrooms two teachers and 
 three cooks.I like it better than my  
 other school because there are not so 
 many children.In my other school there
 were nearly 200 children.The two      
 teachers are called Mrs Morgan and Mr 
 Howells.Every Thursday there are      
 violin lessons for 3 of the children  
 and on Tuesdays there are Welsh       
 lessons for some children.The yard is 
 quite big and there is some grass. One
 classroom is empty because there are  
 not so many children as last year. The
 other teacher was Mrs.Jones.The dinner
 in school is nice. Mrs Harries makes  
 them and Mrs Morgan helps. Mrs Evans  
 does the washing up and cleans the    
 school.We have swimming in Lampeter on
 Fridays. We pay 45p for the bus.
