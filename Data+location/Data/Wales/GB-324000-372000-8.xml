		<title>08My Sunday</title>
		<content> On Sunday I{awoke}at eight o'clock.   
 After eating a bowl of Frosties for   
{breakfast,}I went upstairs and got    
 dressed, then I watched "Hunter" on   
 the television- I had recorded it on  
 the video the night before. My father 
 started to cook the{dinner.}We had    
 lamb, mint sauce, rost potatoes,      
 carrots, cabbage, peas and gravy, then
 a drink of Lemonade.{After dinner}my  
 mother decided to wash my hair- I     
 hate having my hair washed in the     
 afternoon. I went to Wepre Park where 
 there was a big fete- I walked up into
 the Bluebell-covered woods, and on to 
 Ewloe castle. My brother and I played 
 hide and seek within the walls. At    
{tea-time}we ate ham sandwiches and    
 drank milk. We watched "Murder She    
 Wrote" on television and went to{bed  
 at 9.30.                              
                                       </content>
