		<content> There are all different kinds of      
 houses,there are flats,semi-detached  
 and new developments.The houses can be
 large for big families and small for  
 just a small family.Houses can also   
 have big windows and small windows and
 it can have big rooms and small rooms 
 too.If you don't look after your house
 properly it can go scruffy.You're best
 to paint your house once in a while   
 because the paint can come off.If you 
 don't paint your house it can go      
 mouldy and it would smell so it would 
 be a good idea to wash all of your    
 house and make sure it was clean.Old  
 people have houses with no stairs so  
 it won't be difficult for them,so     
 their bed will be downstairs and not  
 upstairs.You should have a new carpet 
 every once in a while so that it will 
 not go grubby.                        
                                       </content>
