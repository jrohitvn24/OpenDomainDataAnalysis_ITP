		<title>03Employment At Sealand.</title>
		<content> For many years unemployment was a word
 that was new to our area.But in the   
 late 1970's British Steel Corporation 
 at Shotton less than a mile away      
 reduced its work force from around    
 12,000 to 3,000.This caused a lot of  
 unemployment in this area,as some     
 three quarters of the population had  
 some connection with the works.Now    
 with nearly twenty per cent of the    
 population on the dole great efforts  
 are being made to bring new industry  
 to our area.Many firms are coming to  
 the new Deeside Industrial Park,but   
 only a few people are able to find    
 employment there.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
