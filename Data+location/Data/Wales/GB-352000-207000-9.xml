		<content> In{1945}the{Redbrook Tinplate Co.,    
{renowned for producing}the thinnest   
 tinplate in the world, flourished.    
 Most village men and a few women      
 worked there. On its site is the{     
{Redbrook Construction Ltd. Company}   
 which employs few village men. Most   
 men and women have to go outside the  
 village to work.                      
 There were two public houses in       
{Lower Redbrook},{The King's Head}and  
{The Bell Inn.}The former was replaced 
 by the{Startime Garage.}There was no  
 Sunday opening then.                  
 Then there was a fortnightly{dance}and
{billiards}in the hall and the wireless
 or card games at home.Now{bingo}and{  
{whist drives}are held in the hall and{
{television,video recorders}and        
{computers}provide home entertainment.
