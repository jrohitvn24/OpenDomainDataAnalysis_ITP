		<content> A railway passes through our grid.    
 There is a station at Radyr.32 trains 
 pass through each day on average      
 running to Treherbert,Barry &amp; Merthyr 
 from Cardiff Queen Street Station.One 
 train a week goes to Bristol.Passenger
 and goods trains use the line.Coke &amp;  
 coal are the main goods transported.  
 The Glamorganshire Canal, now a nature
 reserve,once carried coal from the    
 valleys to Cardiff Docks where it was 
 exported world-wide.It was widely used
 in the eighteenth and nineteenth      
 centuries.The River Taff which starts 
 in the Brecon Beacons runs into the   
 sea in Cardiff.An hourly bus service  
 runs in Radyr.Bus services are more   
 frequent in Whitchurch as the valley  
 services pass through the village.    
 Every 10-11 year old child in Radyr   
 owned a bicycle.The BMX is very       
 popular in 1985.                      </content>
