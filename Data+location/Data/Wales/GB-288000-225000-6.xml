		<title>06FARMING, SHEEP BREEDS</title>
		<content> Although the annual wool clip provides
 one source of farm income, this is    
 only secondary to the income derived  
 from the sale of fat lambs, aided by  
 the current EEC Sheepmeat Regime.     
 Consequently the selecton  of stock   
 breeds and the management of the      
 flocks is geared to meat rather than  
 wool production.                      
 The native breed is the WELSH MOUNTAIN
 SHEEP, but in this area it has been   
 improved by crossing with CHEVIOT rams
 to produce the BRECKNOCK HILL CHEVIOT-
 a recognised separate breed.   Further
 crossing with lowland breeds, notably 
 the SUFFOLK, has greatly improved the 
 size and weight of lambs.Each farm has
 its resident flock of breeding ewes to
 which is added each years crop of ewe 
 lambs.  Ram lambs are sold for slaught
 -er at about 6 months old. No wethers 
 are kept.                             </content>
