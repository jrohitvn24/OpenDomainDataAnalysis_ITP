		<title>06Sarn Holy Trinity Church</title>
		<content> Sarn is a small place,but has two holy
 places-a church and a chapel.The{     
{church}was built about 1860,and holds 
 about 150 people.Basically there are  
 two rooms,the main body and a vestry. 
 In the church there is an old{font}   
 which belonged to the 13th Century    
 Chapel of Llanfihangel near Gwernygo  
 in Sarn parish.The{organ}which was    
 erected in 1931,used to have a hand   
 pump,but now is worked by electricity.
 Over the altar is a large{            
{stained-glass window}showing Jesus    
 blessing the children,and his         
 Ascension.There are two other windows,
 with pictures of St.George and        
 St.Michael.There is a{Family Service} 
 once a month, and a Communion Service 
 on the other Sundays.The vicar lives  
 four miles away, and has to take      
 services at three different churches.
