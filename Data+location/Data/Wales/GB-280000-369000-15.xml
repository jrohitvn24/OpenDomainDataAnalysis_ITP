		<content> In 1985 half of the houses in the     
 village are occupied by Pensioners. As
 a result, the number of villagers who 
 are employed is small. In olden days  
 the villagers were either craftsmen or
 they worked on local farms or at the  
 Bodnant Estate. Most of the people now
 working travel by car to Dolgarrog    
 Aluminium Works or to Colwyn Bay or   
 Llandudno. There are only a few farm  
 workers today. The Bodnant Estate     
 still employ a number of men as       
 gardeners and ladies to help with the 
 catering facilties. Most of the young 
 people enter Llandrillo Technical     
 College when they leave school but    
 when they qualify they must leave the 
 district to find work. Young people   
 who pursue a College education have   
 little hope of returning to their     
 native village. Some people come to   
 the area to establish businesses.     </content>
