		<title>07ATTITUDES OF PENNARD FARMERS</title>
		<content> SOME FARMERS THINK THAT IT IS EASIER  
 NOW THAN WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED      
 FARMING. OTHERS DO NOT. WITH ALL THE  
 NEW EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY YOU WOULD 
 THINK THAT IT IS EASIER NOW.          
   MOST FARMERS PREFER NOT TO HAVE     
 THEIR LAND USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE 
 APART FROM FARMING, E.G. CAMPING,     
 CARAVANNING OR SHOWS.                 
   SOME FARMERS WOULD LIKE MORE LAND   
 THAN THEY ALREADY HAVE BUT SOME PREFER
 THE NUMBER OF ACRES THEY ALREADY HAVE.
   ALL FARMERS IN THE AREA OF PENNARD  
 HAVE GOT CHILDREN, AND THEY WOULD LIKE
 THEIR CHILDREN TO CARRY ON THEIR FARM 
 IF THE CHILDREN WANTED TO.            
   NONE OF THE FARMS IN THE PENNARD    
 AREA DO BED AND BREAKFAST FOR         
 TOURISTS. MOST FARMERS THINK THAT MOST
 TOURISTS ARE FRIENDLY, BUT SOME DAMAGE
 PROPERTY OF THE FARMER.
