		<title>08"The Mountain"</title>
		<content>  The mountain is a hill outside the   
 village. I go up the mountain a few   
 times a week. i go with my friends. We
 take our binoculars with us to go bird
 watching, we see Starlings, Thrushes, 
 Blue Tits, Crows and Wood Pigeon. We  
 sometimes see Rabbits, Snakes, Sheep, 
 Cows and Horses. Some people take     
 their dogs up there. Some boys take   
 motorbikes up there and ride them     
 along a course. You can walk along the
 mountain for about one and a half     
 miles and go down the other side on to
 the common. The reason l like the     
 mountain is that it is close to my    
 home, it is good fun to go up there to
 play games like hide and seek,and spy 
 on people!
