		<title>20LLANDOGO AREA. CREDITS.</title>
		<content>   Llandogo is a picturesque village   
 set on a steep hillside above the     
 River Wye.The houses and cottages     
 scattered on the hillside are linked  
 by narrow walled lanes.The area is    
 much as it was in the past,the only   
 reminders of the busy river traffic   
 are local place names-Botany Bay,Barb-
 adoes,Sloop Hotel and Trow Cottage.   
 Only two local descendants remain _   
 Mrs Beard and Mr Howard Brown who is  
 known locally as the 'Elver King' as  
 he fished for elvers for over sixty   
 years.As in the past the area receives
 many visitors throughout the year.    
      CREDITS.                         
 The survey of this block was made by  
 the pupils of St.Briavels Parochial   
 Primary School and their Headmaster   
 Mr.G.Williams and assistant teacher   
 Mrs.R.Andrews.They wish to thank all  
 those who helped them in their task.  </content>
