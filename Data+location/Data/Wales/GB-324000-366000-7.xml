		<content> Northop Hall have had a well known    
 cricket team in the North Wales area  
 for many years.Season after season    
 they have done well in both local and 
 national cricket competitions -this   
 year is no exception.The team are just
 four steps away from a magical trip   
 to Lords in the National Village      
 Knockout.They made short work of      
 neighbours Northop in the Cheshire and
 Clwyd Zone Final on Sunday July 1st to
 win by a comfortable seven wickets in 
 a game  restricted to 26 overs        
 because of rain.Northop who knocked   
 out mighty Marchwiel in the           
 semi-finals, never got going and were 
 out with only 55 runs on the          
 scoreboard.Despite a couple of scares 
 Hall's experienced side saw their way 
 through to victory for the loss of 3  
 wickets for a place in the last 32.
