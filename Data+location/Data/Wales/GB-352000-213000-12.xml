		<title>12THE RIVER WYE _ FISHING</title>
		<content> Today, much of the{River Wye}is owned 
 privately. The owners can hire out or 
 sell their property. Sometimes they   
 have to pay rates of up to{Â£400}      
 according to the number of fish caught
 in a year. The main types of fish{    
{trout, salmon}and{coarse fish}(chub,  
 dace,grayling and char). People no    
 longer keep trout in the river in     
 large numbers but instead they use    
 trout ponds.{Salmon}is still the main 
 game fish of the river despite its    
 fall in numbers. this fall is partly  
 due to the number of game fish which  
 eat salmon eggs and{poaching}is also a
 problem. Also when the salmon leave   
 the river to go to their feeding      
 grounds many of them are caught by    
 netsmen.
