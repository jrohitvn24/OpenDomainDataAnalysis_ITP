		<title>11Rossett Church</title>
		<content> The name Rossett is derived from the  
 Welsh 'Yr Orsedd' which means 'the    
 judgement seat'.                      
                                       
 The earliest record of a chapel       
 (to St. Leonard) was in 1397.  By 1620
 there was a chapel dedicated to St.   
 Peter in Rossett.  The first Parish   
 Church was built in 1841 and the first
 vicar, Rev. Thomas Wickham, was       
 appointed in 1863.                    
                                       
 The church was not large enough so the
 present church was started in 1891.   
 The cost of building and furnishings  
 was Â£9000.  The church is still in    
 good condition and the original bells 
 are used.  Weddings and christenings  
 are regularly performed.              
 Two Flower Festivals have been held at
 the Church and proved very successful.
