 There are two 11th century churches at
 Rogiet,{St Mary's}and{St Michael      
{Lanvihangel.}Between 1980 and 1985 the
 following conservation work was       
 carried out.                          
    At St Mary's the roof was repaired 
 and the pinacles replaced; wire guards
 were fitted to windows; walls were    
 repointed and the buttresses repaired;
 a new ceiling was put in the porch;   
 the litchgate was repaired; old,      
 dangerous yew trees were felled and   
 the timber used to make side seats in 
 porch.                                
    Advice and assistance was provided 
 by the District and County Councils   
 and the labour was provided by young  
 unemployed men on a Y.O.P. scheme.
