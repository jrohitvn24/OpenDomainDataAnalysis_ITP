  The blacksmith's forge is dusty and  
 dirty. In the corner of his forge he  
 has a fire. It is hot and sweaty by   
 the fire. He has a place where he puts
 the horses. The forge is a stony      
 place, it has stone walls and stone   
 floors. The blacksmith's forge is     
 quiet and peaceful all you hear is the
 hammer on the metal or anvil. In the  
 forge he has a cupboard for keeping   
 his scraps of metal and horse shoes.  
 He keeps iron in one, because people  
 can be very fussy, and steel on       
 another shelf. The fire is very       
 dangerous because of all the sparks   
 and it makes the whole room smell of  
 smoke. Sometimes it is very steamy    
 because of the steam which comes from 
 the metal when it is put in water to  
 cool and harden.
