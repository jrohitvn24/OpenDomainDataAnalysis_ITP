 is{Powys Castle.} Built in the 13th   
 and 14th Centuries, it stands on a    
 rocky outcrop about \ mile outside    
 Welshpool.  It is presently occupied  
 by the sixth Earl of Powys but was    
 donated to the National Trust in 1952.
 It now receives 70,000 visitors a     
 year.                                 
{ The Welshpool and Llanfair Light     
{Railway,}one of the "Great Little     
 Trains of Wales", was constructed in  
 1903 to a gauge of 2'6".  It was      
 closed in 1956 but rescued by a       
 Preservation Society which has cleared
 the line and built a terminus at Raven

 Welshpool with the small town of      
 Llanfair Caereinion, a distance of    
 about 8 miles.
