		<content> Badminton is similer to tennis but    
 in                                    
 stead of a ball you use a plastic cone
 which is called a{SHUTTLE COCK.       
 Badminton is almost the same as tennis
 but you must hit the shuttle cock over
 a higher net,and it must not touch the
 ground.                               
  GAMES WE PLAY OUT OF SCHOOL.         
 Some of the games we play out of      
 school are hide and seek and tag.Hide 
 and seek is based on the of a few     
 people hide and one other person goes 
 and tries to find you.The first person
 to be found will go on it next.       
   Tag is where by one person has the  
 tag,and it has to be passed on to the 
 other players.
