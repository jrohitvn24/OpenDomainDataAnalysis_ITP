		<title>14Farming 8 - Great House Farm</title>
		<content> The farmer of Great House owns 2 other
 adjoining properties. They are North  
 Farm and Ton Farm, and all three      
 together account for 650 acres of     
 land, much of which stretches to the  
 other side of Llanvapley.             
 We were surprised top hear that he    
 only sows 50 acres of potatoes because
 while we drove along the road it      
 seemed that the potato fields         
 stretched as far as the eye could see.
 In one of the farmer's huge barns     
 stood a massive grain silo capable of 
 holding 90 tons of grain. He used 120 
 acres of his land to grow grain crops.
 The farmer's son did not work for his 
 father but owned 3 fish and chip shops
 and one bakery. So the farmer sold    
 most of his grain and potatoes to his 
 son.
