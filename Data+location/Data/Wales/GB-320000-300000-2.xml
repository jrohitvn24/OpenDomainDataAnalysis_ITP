 Forden is'nt a very big place but     
 there are a lot of things in it like  
 the school which is small with about  
 sixty children. Also by the school    
 there is a community centre where we  
 have our gym. There are three pubs,   
 The Railway Inn,The Cock Hotel and The
 Compass. There is a shop which        
 sells rustic garden furniture which Mr
 Bright makes himself.                 
                                       
 Much of Forden is farm land. There is 
 also Brynhyfryd Hospital for mentaly  
 ill people. The river Severn runs     
 straight through Forden. The church in
 Forden is called St Michaels and was  
 rebuilt in Victorian times. There is  
 also St Michaels Crescent where there 
 are a lot of houses.
