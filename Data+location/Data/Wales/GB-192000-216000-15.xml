		<title>15Crowhill Pumping Station</title>
		<content>   Crowhill Pumping Station was built  
 round about 1960 for the ESSO Refinery
 and has{three large pumps}with a power
         {of 375 h.p.each.             
   Since Esso has left Pembrokeshire   
 the pumping station is not in constant
 use but is the back up for Canaston:_ 
   if anything goes wrong at Canaston, 
 water can be pumped directly from the 
 Cleddau River. Sometime ago, holes    
 were bored in the bed of the river to 
 improve the water. There is a well    
 near the pumping station. They have no
 polluton monitor there, as they have  
 at Canaston.                          
    {** The Depot At Withybush **      
{ }It is a large new building where    
 about 120 people work for The Welsh   
 Water Authority, which is responsible 
 now for sewage and rivers as well as  
 water supply to homes.
