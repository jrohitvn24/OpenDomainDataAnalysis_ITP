		<content> 3.The Rev.R.H.Williams is the chairman
 of our school,and he uses it for      
 meetings.                             
 4.On special occasions the            
 Rev.R.H.Williams comes to our school  
 and joins in the services.            
 We went out of school and did a door  
 to door survey.8/31 respondents less  
 than 30 yrs. old attended church or   
 chapel regulary.This is very few      
 considering 14/15 respondents 50 yrs. 
 and over went to church or chapel     
 reguarly. As local people grow older  
 church and chapel seems to become more
 popular. The older people of Rhos     
 enjoy going to church and chapel      
 mostly for company and a gossip about 
 the weekly news(although they would   
 never admit it!). Here are some names 
 of chapels and churches in Rhos:      
 Capel Mawr,Cyfelli,St.Davids,Sieon    
 ,Penal,Ebinezer and St.Johns(school). </content>
