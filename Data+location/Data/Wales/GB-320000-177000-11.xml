		<content> FIRST THE HORSE WORKED ONE,AND WE     
 COULD SEE WHERE THE HORSE'S HARNESS   
 HAD WORN AWAY THE CEILING BEAMS IN TWO
 PLACES AS HE WENT ROUND AND ROUND.THEN
 THERE WAS THE STEAM PUG AND FINALLY   
 THE ELECTRIC PUG.THERE WERE ALSO HAND 
 WORKED AND ELECTRICAL WHEELS FOR      
 TURNING POTS.HOWEVER,MR GILES SEEMS   
 NOT TO USE THESE OLD GADGETS.HE       
 SOFTENS THE CLAY BY HAND,PUTS IT IN   
 MOULDS AND THEN FIRES IT IN ONE OF    
 THREE ELECTRIC_HEATED KILNS.
