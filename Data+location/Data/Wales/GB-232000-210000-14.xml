		<title>14LLANSTEFFAN AREA: TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Public transport is inadequate. One   
 bus plies 4 times daily between both  
 villages and Carmarthen, but not on   
 Sundays or in the evenings. It does   
 not serve the outlying houses. School 
 buses (not available to the general   
 public) take children to and from     
 school. To catch trains and long      
 distance coaches we have to go to     
 Carmarthen. Thus to the majority of   
 people a car is a necessity but not   
 all can afford one. A small minority  
 have motorbikes or bicycles.  A       
 limited "country cars" service is     
 being started up by the WRVS, operated
 by volunteer car-owners and financed  
 by Dyfed County Council. The District 
 Council gives free bus tokens or cash 
 in lieu to pensioners. Only one garage
 sells petrol locally (it is outside   
 the present "block", at Waunygroes    
 near Llanybri.                        </content>
