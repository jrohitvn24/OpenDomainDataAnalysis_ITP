 in Presteigne if the manned fire      
 engine didn't lead the torch light

 football club ground for the annual   
 town{bonfire and fireworks display.   
     The town also has two{full time   
{policemen}who not only police         
 Presteigne but also patrol a much     
 wider area.They use a police van and a
 car.Also there is an{ambulance        
 service,one ambulance and two         
 drivers.This ambulance also covers a  
 wide area.The nearest{cottage hospital
 is 7mls. away in Knighton but the     
 larger hospitals are 24mls. away in   
 Hereford.
