		<title>07FARMING</title>
		<content> This area has excellent farming land  
 especially on the valley floor.On the 
 hills there is good grazing land for  
 sheep,while lower down the soil is    
 fertile and easy to work.Many crops   
 can be grown,the most popular being   
 barley.Much of this is sown in the    
 autumn.Hay and silage is also grown as
 fodder.                               
    Most of the farms are mixed,that is
 they rear cattle and sheep and also   
 grow crops.Some farms have large dairy
 herds of friesian cows.They send the  
 milk to the creamery at nearby        
 Llandyrnog where it is made into      
 cheese.                               
    There is one large egg producing   
 farm,and stables for rearing horses.  
    Markets are held weekly in Ruthin, 
 Denbigh and other nearby towns and    
 these are widely used by the local    
 farmers.                              </content>
