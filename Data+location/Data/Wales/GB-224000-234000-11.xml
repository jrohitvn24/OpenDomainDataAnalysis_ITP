		<title>11Coming to Bwlch-y-groes (1)</title>
		<content> In the early 1970's we were becoming  
 dissatisfied with the relentless      
 pursuit of progress which had meant   
 moving every few years.The continued  
 upheaval was bad for the children,the 
 urban environment oppressive.We       
 decided to opt out,buy a house with a 
 little land and aim for a degree of   
 self-sufficiency.Back to the Simple   
 Life!It soon became apparent that     
 others had the same idea,and that the 
 simple life in England was far beyond 
 our means.We turned to Wales where    
 property was cheaper.The North was    
 beautiful but bleak and rather        
 foreign,so we looked to the South.Pure
 chance led us to Bwlch-y-groes but we 
 loved it on sight and in 1979 we      
 arrived,after five years of effort.The
 obvious difference is the language,but
 that is not the whole story,though it 
 is the key to the area's character.   </content>
