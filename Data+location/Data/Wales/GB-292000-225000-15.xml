		<title>15A PET LAMB IN DEFYNNOG</title>
		<content>  Our farm keeps about fifty cows and  
 about four hundred sheep. I would like
 a horse (maybe when I'm older) and mum
 would like some goats, but we do have 
 3 dogs and a tabby cat.               
  Today we were pitching &amp; earmarking, 
 castrating and scarrifying. Me and my 
 brother and grampa were the catchers, 
 mummy earmarked and granny pitched.   
 Today we did the Sufolks &amp; the Jacobs.
 We started after dinner and finished  
 at tea time. Then we went around the  
 sheep that had still not lambed. Daddy
 spotted one of the mules which was    
 lambing. He went over and pulled the  
 lamb which had stopped breathing. It  
 later died. We tried to surrogate a   
 Sufolk lamb with a mule mother but she
 rejected it. So we had a pet lamb. At 
 6 we took the lambs to the flat field 
 in Dan-y-cefn. Then went home for tea.
