		<title>17TRANSPORT, THE TRAMROAD</title>
		<content> An interesting part of the industrial 
 history of the area was the attempt by
 Christie to built a tramroad over the 
 hills from the upper Tawe valley to   
 Sennybridge.  This was intended to    
 transport agricultural lime to the Usk
 valley but without coal for burning   
 the lime the scheme was doomed to     
 failure.  Since Christie did not      
 own land within the Coal Measures he  
 had to lease a mine, which contributed
 to his bankruptcy.  Therefore Claypon 
 completed this horse-drawn tramway    
 which operated until the advent of the
 Neath and Brecon Railway.  It was a   
 3ft gauge track using short L-shaped  
 lines mounted directly to large flat  
 stones which were the sleepers. These 
 stones with the holes drilleld in them
 may be seen in some parts of the line.
 Elsewhere, however, it was completely 
 destroyed by the later railway.       </content>
