		<content>     {St. David'S Foundation}is an     
 organisation set up to help the       
 terminally ill and their families.  It
 is situated in Cambrian House,        
 formally the residence of{Thomas      
{Spittle,}a mid-eighteenth century Iron
 Foundry owner.{The hospice,}which was 
 officially opened in 1984 by the      
 Prince and Princess of Wales, offers  
 many facilities to the patients.  The 
 majority of patients in there attend  
 daily, some pursuing activities such  
 as pottery, painting and needlecraft, 
 others enjoying reading, playing games
 or simply chatting with other         
 patients. This enables their families 
 to have a break. Other facilities in  
 the building include a general store, 
 hairdressing salon and a chapel. The  
 hospice is run by eight qualified     
 nurses and numerous volunteers 24     
 hours a day.                          </content>
