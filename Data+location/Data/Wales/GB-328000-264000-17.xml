		<title>17Fish Farming</title>
		<content> The fish farm a mile from Presteigne  
 breeds{rainbow trout}for sale.The     
 water supply comes from the{River Lugg
 close to the farm.Several million     
 gallons are needed to get enough      
{oxygen}in the water.The trout are fed 
 on dried pelleted fish.To prevent baby
 fish dying they are watched carefully 
 and the pools are netted to stop      
{herons}diving at them.The size,in     
 weight of fish,which they start with, 
 is about about a{hundred fish to the  
{lb.wt}.They are killed for sale from  
 8oz upward and sold at the{Birmingham 
{Wholesale Market}hotels,and to local  
 people.The fish suffer from various   
{diseases,}including  stress due to    
 captivity.As a family concern,they do 
 not want to over-expand nor turn the  
 farm into a tourist attraction.
