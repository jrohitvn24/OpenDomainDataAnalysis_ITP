		<content>   In 1923 there were about 6 cars,    
 belonging to business people. Most    
 farmers used ponies and traps. Calves 
 went to market in a float but there   
 were 2 cattle vans in the area. Cattle
 would often be walked to the market in
 Wrexham.There were 3 buses a week run 
 by Williams and Hodgson from Wrexham  
 to Overton.If families were going     
 anywhere special, they hired a taxi.  
   Some farms date back to the C17th   
 e.g. Eyton Bank 1649, others were     
 built earlier but most later.A chapel 
 on the way to Erbistock lies unused   
 and unsold because the deeds have     
 never been found.                     
   During the Second World War, the    
 army had a camp on the Wynnstay Estate
 and a headquarters in the hall(now    
 Lindisfarne School).
