 pupils must now travel to Llandogo,   
 four miles to the north.Secondary     
 pupils travel to Kingsmark            
 Comprehensive School in Chepstow      
 unless parents wish to educate them   
 privately at Monmouth.                
  During the lifetime of Tintern School
 numbers grew to 109 pupils when the   
 school had to be enlarged,but fell to 
 22 at closure.Unfortunately the school
 was built over the path of a stream   
 and,at one stage,a cavern was found to
 exist below the P.E. shed.Flooding    
 occurred on a number of occasions.    
  The school once formed an essential  
 part of community life and its closure
 has been a source of great concern and
 regret to residents.All efforts to
