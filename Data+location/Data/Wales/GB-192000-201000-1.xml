 The South Pembs Golf Club has been in 
 existence for 20 years.It is a 9 hole 
 course sited on the Barrack Hill,the  
 clubhouse is in the old Defensible    
 Barracks.It was built here because it 
 was the only open space available at  
 the time.Golf is played in all weather
 except the snow but as the Barrack    
 Hill is so exposed it is not very     
 pleasant on some days.The joining fee 
 is Â£50 and the membership fee Â£125 per
 annum.Children and students have free 
 membership.Most people carry a golf   
 bag but some use a trolley and in it  
 usually carry 3 woods,9 irons and a   
 putter.For most people golf is a very 
 relaxing game though many find it     
 difficult to play.However, because of 
 the handicap system,players of totally
 different standards can enjoy a       
 competetive game.                     </content>
