		<title>10EMPLOYMENT - NORTH PEMBROKE</title>
		<content>    H.M.Dockyard was the was the main  
 reason  for the growth of Pembroke and
 the building of Pembroke Dock and     
 since the Dockyard closed in the      
 1920s,there has always been high      
 unemployment in the town. In recent   
 years,up to one third of the men in   
 the town have been out of work.The    
 building of oil refineries and a power
 station have  helped provide jobs, as 
 has the opening of the B&amp;I Ferry      
 Terminal at Pembroke Dock, but the    
 area still has many problems.         
    Several factories in the area have 
 closed down lately, though people hope
 that the new enterprise zone will     
 bring jobs to the area.               
    Of 17 children interviewed in the  
 area, 3 had fathers who worked on the 
 refineries,2 worked in the Dockyard,1 
 was a farmer and 7 had other jobs. 10 
 children had mothers with jobs.       </content>
