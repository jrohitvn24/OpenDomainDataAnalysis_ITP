		<title>01The Tywyn Hills in Gwynedd</title>
		<content> Most of the region is covered by      
 grass, heath and moorland - the valley
 floors of the rivers  Aysynni and     
 Fathew containing enclosed grazing    
 land while further up, the hillland   
 exhibit scrub and moorland.  Numerous 
 v shaped river valley.  Dot the area, 
 flowing into the Afon Fathew.  As     
 expected much of the land is used for 
 cattle and sheep-raising, but there is
 also a local railway which follows the
 valley floor towards the coactal down 
 of Tywyn.  Patches of deciduous trees 
 occasionally cover the lowland plains 
 and lower parts of Tywyn Hills.
