		<content>{                                      
{LANDSCAPE/BUILDING:}Important for two 
 reasons: was the seat of Williams     
 family and it created the village of  
 Miskin as part of the estate. House   
 dates back to Elizabethan times.      
 Gardens neglected but has some        
 exotic trees.                         
{FUNCTION:}Much land sold by Williams  
 family. The House is converted into 14
 flats because the family think it is  
 too big for family use                
{FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:}Sir Brandon Rhys 
 Williams wishes to develop remaining  
 land near M4 for industries and       
 warehousing. Part of this area, now   
 marginal farming land in the valley   
 bottom, will be landscaped as a golf  
 course, while the House may become a  
 Country Club with a range of leisure  
 and sports facilities.
