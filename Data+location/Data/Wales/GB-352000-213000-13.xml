		<title>13THE MONMOUTH REGATTA</title>
		<content>{Monmouth Regatta}was founded in{1872,}
 but it lapsed for a while. On{Whit    
{Sunday, 1985}there was a record entry 
 of over a{thousand competitors        
 consisting of{232 teams and 50        
{umpires.}There was a race every three 
 minutes from 0900-1930 and the        
 organisation was very efficient. A lot
 of clubs travelled from{Worcester}to{ 
{Monnmouth}to{Hereford}in three days to
 attend these three major regattas in  
 the South West. The main events this  
 year were won by:                     
   {Monmouth School}Senior A Coxed 4's.
   {Thames Tradesmen}Elite 8's.        
   {City of Oxford}Elite coxless 4's.  
   {Kingston}Elite sculls.             
 This year's event was typical in that 
 no crews entered from Europe, Scotland
 or Ireland.
