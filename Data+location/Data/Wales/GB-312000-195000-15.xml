		<content> To find out about the economics of the
 area we planned some questions,and    
 interviewed Mr.Prosser the manager of 
 LLoyds Bank Pengam and Mr.Jenkins the 
 manager of the Halifax Building       
 Society Fleur-de-lys.When asked what  
 he thought the role of his bank was in
 Pengam in 1985,Mr.Prosser felt that it
 was to support the community and      
 industry,and to provide a service.Part
 of the service was to provide         
 facilities to let people save and     
 borrow and to pass money from one to  
 another.He felt that the bank had     
 become more efficient with the new    
 computerized banking systems.Monday   
 and Friday were the busiest days with 
 about 200 customers,on average daily, 
 dealing with Â£11000 to Â£12000 a day.  
 Mr.Prosser was glad that there was no 
 cash point at Pengam,as he felt it    
 would loose some of the personal touch</content>
