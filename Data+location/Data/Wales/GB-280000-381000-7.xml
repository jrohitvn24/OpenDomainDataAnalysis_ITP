		<content> The Little Orme had been inhabited for
 a very long time. Its name comes from 
 the {Viking}word{orme}meaning{serpent.
 The Vikings raided the coast of Wales 
 about 800 A.D.Long before that the {  
{Romans}mined{copper}on the Orme.Last  
 year with his metal detector my Dad   
 found some Roman coins and other      
 things made of{bronze;}animals heads, 
 brooches,knife handles and other      
 things which we were told, were bucket
 handles.We took them to the National  
 Museum in Cardiff.Two animal heads    
 were very rare. The coins were dated  
 280-290 A.D. The other things were    
 probably the same age.The bronzes had 
{bronze disease.}In the museum they    
 showed us how to treat the disease and
 conserve the finds.We left them there.
