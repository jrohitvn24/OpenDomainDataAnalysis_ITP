		<content>    The riding stables at Pen-y-Van    
 have been established for 35 years.   
 They are owned and managed by a local 
 lady. There are 6 horses and 13 ponies
 which are stabled on site on the 6.75 
 acres of land.                        
    A typical day would include lessons
 for about 20 people in groups, at     
 hourly intervals.In the summer, with  
 tourists, there may be up to 60       
 visitors a day.Rides are taken on site
 or in nearby woodland.                
    It costs Â£3.00 for children and    
 Â£4.00 for adults per lesson.The horses
 and ponies are fed on hay and horse   
 nuts.The horses are shod every three  
 months. Many local people, especially 
 children, take advantage of the       
 facilities offered, and local children
 also enjoy grooming the horses and    
 ponies and helping to muck out the    
 stables.                              </content>
