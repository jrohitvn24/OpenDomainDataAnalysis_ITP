		<content>{An account written by Paula Martin.   
 My family own three shops in this     
 area.We used to have four but we sold 
 the fish and chip shop because it was 
 too much for my family to cope with.We
 have a small shop in the community of 
 Six Bells which sells gifts as well as
 some groceries,we also have a shop in 
 Brynithel,which sells newspapers,food,
 sweets and cigarrettes, our third shop
 is in Llanhilleth and we call this one
 "The Mini Market" because we sell     
 almost everything.My mother,father and
 oldest sister look after these three  
 shops,but sometimes I help.
