		<title>20A TOURISTS VIEW OF ABERAERON</title>
		<content> On first entering Aberaeron I thought 
 it was a very attractive but quiet    
 town. We drove through pretty farmland
 of green pastures and gently,rolling, 
 wooded hills. The coastal scenery was 
 similar to that found in Cornwall with
 spectactular views of the coastline of
 Cardigan Bay. We parked the car by the
 Harbour and had a very pleasant walk  
 along the quay and promenade. We      
 watched the children hunt for crabs on
 the pebble beach. On returnng we      
 sampled the famous honey ice cream.   
 We had a good choice of cafes and     
 restaurants for our lunch and all the 
 pubs did bar snacks. After lunch we   
 went to the aquarium,visited the yacht
 club to admire the various boats and  
 as all tourists, we went to the craft 
 shops to buy souvenirs.               
 On reflection Aberaeron is not quiet  
 but it is unspoilt and worth a visit. </content>
