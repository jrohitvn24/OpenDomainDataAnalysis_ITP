		<content> The Ramblers Association which was    
 formed in 1935 is a group of people   
 concerned about retaining footpaths   
 who also enjoy walking.The Jubilee    
 walk will be 2,100 miles long and it  
 will wind its way through both England
 and Wales.Anyone will be welcome to   
 join the walk,about 10-11 miles is    
 covered each day.                     
   On the 31st of May 1985 their walk  
 took them through Brockweir and onto  
 Bigsweir.They followed the Offa's Dyke
 path.Their leader on this stretch of  
 the walk was Mr.Roberts.              
   Rachel Creswick of St.Briavels      
 school joined them on the walk and    
 Mr.Williams,the headmaster spotted    
 them in the Hudnalls wood.All the     
 walkers are signing a commemorative   
 book which will be handed to the Prime
