		<content>                                       
 ON FRIDAY JULY 5TH. IN THE MONMOUTH   
 BEACON IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE PLAN 
 FOR THE NEW SCHOOL AT TRELLECH HAD    
 BEEN PASSED.                          
 THE NEW SCHOOL WILL HAVE A JUNIOR AND 
 INFANTS LIBRARY, CHANGING ROOMS,      
 COVERED WORKAREA AND A HALL. TRELLECH 
 NEW SCHOOL WILL REPLACE PENALT, THE   
 NARTH, CATBROOK, LLANISHEN AND        
 TRELLECH OLD SCHOOL. THE NEW SCHOOL IS
 OPENING IN SEPTEMBER 1987, BECAUSE THE
 OLD SCHOOL HAS NOT GOT THE FACILITIES 
 LIKE INDOOR TOILETS,ONLY TWO TEACHERS 
 PER SCHOOL, AND NO PROPER HALL.       
 THERE IS OF COURSE ANOTHER VIEW, AND  
 SOME PEOPLE IN THR OTHER VILLAGES ARE 
 ANGRY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT THEIR  
 LITTLE CHILDREN TO GO ON BUSES,AND    
 THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR OWN SMALL     
 VILLAGE SCHOOLS.
