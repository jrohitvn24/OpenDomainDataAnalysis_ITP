		<title>15I HOPE TO BE A DENTIST</title>
		<content>   My name is Annelie Williams and I am
 12 years old. I live in {Three Crosses
 which is about 4 miles away from my   
 school,{Bishopston Comprehensive,}it  
 hasn't been there long just 9 years as
 it started in 1975 and it is now 1985.
 I travel to school by bus.            
   When I leave school I hope to be a  
{dentist}but that is hoping as there   
 are currently a lot of British people 
 out of work. My mum and dad are quite 
 worried about me when I'm older as you
 could easily get on drugs or some     
 other things which would totally blow 
 your mind.                            
   This age is full of computers and   
 videos and is turning out to be a bad 
 place, in the future I hope it gets   
 better.
