		<content> Oak and Ash to become established.The 
 wood provides excellent habitats for  
 bird and wild life to flourish.The    
 summit of the wood was originally the 
 site of a Hill Fort.All that remains  
 now is a series of ditches.The trust  
 were provided with a grant to protect 
 this very fort.Some of the trees will 
 have to be removed to prevent the     
 roots destroying the ancient remains. 
    There is a small car park near to a
 stone quarry where various walks      
 begin.We found these walks very       
 enjoyable,especially on a warm        
 summer's day.The car park is a good   
 spot for discovering fossils,         
 especially ammonites.Approximately ten
 woodland wardens have been appointed  
 to protect the wood,and to plan for   
 the future.This is in fact,the only   
 spot within the block suitable for    
 purposes of tourism.                  </content>
