		<title>12Employment in Pontrhydyfen.</title>
		<content>     There are no large scale employers
 in our study area. Apart from local   
 businesses and essential services,    
 most people travel out of the area for
 work. Our survey on employment in     
 Pontrhydyfen showed that of all those 
 over the age of 16, 5% were still in  
 full-time education, 28% were retired,
 47% in Full-time employment,10% in    
 part-time employment and 10%          
 unemployed.                           
     Of those in employment, 7%        
 actually work in the village. These   
 would be employed in the three local  
 shops, schools, clubs and chicken     
 farm.
