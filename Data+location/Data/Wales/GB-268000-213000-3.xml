		<content> The area covered by our block has a   
 very poor telecommunications network  
 for public use.  Within the block     
 there are only{three telephone kiosks.
 There is also a large problem with    
{vandalism.}Often none of the three    
 kiosks are in working order.          
 Whithin the block there are two {Post 
{Offices}both in the village of        
 Brynamman.  The area has only one     
 morning postal delivery with          
 collections limited to three per day. 
{Public opinion}on these facilities is 
 that there is room for improvement    
 with more kiosk and a more frequent   
 delivery service.
