		<content>        The estimated population of the
 3x4km area surveyed is 291.           
  In spite of the differences mentioned
 on page 1,  the village is a friendly,
 well  integrated  community,   with no
 class barriers.  However, on the whole
 the older Welsh - speaking inhabitants
 tend to resent the great influx of non
 Welsh speakers with more sophisticated
 lifestyles,    because  they see their
 traditional way of life  being eroded.
 At present   the balance of  Welsh and
 English speakers ( as first language )
 is about equal.   There are still some
 farms  that have an  extremely   basic
 lifestyle.    There are only whites of
 British descent;no other ethnic groups
 at all. The majority of the   commuter
 'incomers'  have  chosen  to live here
 because of its rural situation, and as
 yet unpoiled charm,    and are content
 with the village as it exists today.  </content>
