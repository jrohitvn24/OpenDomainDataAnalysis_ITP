		<content> In January 1984 a new road linking    
 Llanelli with the M4 was opened by    
 Colin Jones, the Welsh Sports         
 Personality of the Year.The road runs 
 close to our school and it is hoped   
 that it will provide a much needed    
 boost to Llanelli's economy.The road  
 is 3.5 miles long and cost Â£7 million 
 for Thyssen's to construct.           
 The project was financed with the aid 
 of the Welsh Office and the E.E.C. and
 is the first phase of a huge road     
 modernising programme for Llanelli.   
 Phase 2 is already underway, with the 
 aim of attracting a variety of        
 industries and employment to the area.
