		<title>12Local Farms</title>
		<content> There ae about 35 farms or small      
 holdings in the block. most are inalnd
 with tracks or self maintained roads  
 leading to them. Milk is collected    
 from the farms on a daily basis by    
 milk tankers. Majority of holdings    
 have telephone and electricity. The   
 poles are placed at several points    
 along the fields. Farm land is divided
 into small fields with high hedges, a 
 haven for small birds and insects.    
 With 4 or 5 well heeled farmers the   
 farmyards are completely concreted and
 very clean. A small number are        
 extremely well run with all modern    
 machinery. There are no breeding bulls
 to be seen roaming the fields, the    
 farer relies on insemination delivered
 from the Cattle Breeding Centre which 
 is centred within a couple of miles   
 away happens to be the largest in the 
 British Isles                         </content>
