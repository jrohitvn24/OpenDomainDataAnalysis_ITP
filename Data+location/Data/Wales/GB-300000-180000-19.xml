		<title>19Employment in Pontyclun</title>
		<content> The rapid growth of Pontyclun was     
 attributable to the construction of   
 the main South Wales railway line and 
 the building of the local railway     
 station.Branch lines to surrounding   
 areas led to it becoming a small but  
 busy railway centre providiing        
 employmentfor a goodly number of      
 railway workers.A number of new       
 industries grew up,adding to the      
 employment opportunities offered by   
 local mines.At the present time,      
 government policy encourages the      
 growth of more industries,all assisted
 by good communications.To be found    
 locally are a range of service        
 industries,shops etc.,a large         
 brewery,local authority services      
 and offices.Nearby are several        
 large industrial concerns,all         
 providing a wide range of employment.
