		<content> Llanelli is a bilingual town where    
 both Welsh and English is spoken.     
 Five of us compiled a simple          
 questionnaire and went out to         
 interview a sample of people with the 
 aim of finding out how much Welsh is  
 spoken in our area today.             
 We discovered that 57% of the people  
 interviewed spoke Welsh as a first    
 language but only 28% of these spoke  
 Welsh in their homes while 9% spoke   
 both English and Welsh at home.The    
 reason for this was because people    
 were married to partners who did not  
 speak Welsh.                          
 Not many children in our school speak 
 Welsh as a first language because most
 Welsh speaking children attend one of 
 the two Welsh-Medium schools in the   
 area.
