		<content>  My name is Georgina Henderson, my    
 nickname is "Scrudge". I am 12 years  
 old, my birthday is in January. I go  
 to{Bishopston Comprehensive School,}  
 and am in my 2nd year out of five here
 I live in the countryside, and I feel 
 lucky for this, but I am worried that 
 there will soon be no countryside left
 All we hear about these days is crime,
 murder, pollution, wars and disaster. 
   USA's president, Mr. Reagan is      
 talking about war in space or{Starwars
 all the science fiction of 10 years   
 ago seems now to be coming true. It's 
 time the world started thinking about 
 the future people, not just about     
 themselves. The governments go ahead  
 with plans and testings, not thinking 
 about the people of the future who    
 could suffer for it for centuries     
 after todays people have died.
