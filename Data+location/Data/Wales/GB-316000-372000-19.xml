		<content>  Some people work in qarries. These   
 are some of the jobs they do crush    
 stone with a steel ball, take stone to
 places in lorries for road making,    
 some people work in offices and others
 service the lorries. People work on   
 farms as well. They mark the sheep to 
 know  which are theirs.They dip the   
 sheep to get the tics and other things
 out of the wool.                      
  In the summer the sheep are sheared  
 because if they  are not sheared      
 the flies will lay maggot eggs. The   
 maggots get over the wool and the wool
 is no use for clothes because it will 
 be too dirty. A few months after the  
 sheep are sheared they are dipped in  
 sheep_dip to destroy the maggots in   
 the wool.
