		<title>09EVENTS IN COITY</title>
		<content>      We are fortunate in Coity to have
 a castle and an ancient church. Many  
 of the events in Coity use these      
 buildings.                            
      Once a year we have a village    
 fete, this is held in the castle      
 grounds.  Stalls are put up and these 
 sell many things like cakes and       
 plants. There are many games and we   
 pay to roll balls and throw things and
 hope to win a prize.  We throw at     
 coconuts and one year we threw        
 wellingtons.  We have a fancy dress   
 parade and starts at the school and   
 arrives at the castle at 2.p.m.  In   
 the evening there is a Barn Dance.    
      The school holds certain events. 
 We have Sports Day and It's a Knock   
 Out Competition. The parents hold a   
 social evening in the school.         
      The church holds fetes  and the  
 curate held it in his garden one year.</content>
