		<content>         {The Buzzard                  
 A buzzard clumsy before flight,       
 But when it is in the sky             
 Is a graceful sight,                  
 With it's eagle like eyes             
 And ripping beak and sharp talons     
 Ready to catch a rabbit or mouse.     
 It's spotted something.               
 Down it flies                         
 To catch it's prey before it goes.    
           {The Heron}                 
 The heron flies majestically,         
 Perhaps clumsily at take off          
 But  once it's in the air             
 It glides over the marsh              
 Then when it lands,                   
 It skilfully plucks fish              
 Out of the river.                     
 To me (the poet)                      
 It's definetely my favourite bird,    
 I don't know about you.
