		<content> There are two non-conformists chapels 
 in our block,both situated at         
 Swyddffynnon.The Methodist chapel has 
 24 members,10 of which attend         
 regularly;and the Baptist chapel has  
 12 members-6 of these attend          
 regularly.One service per Sunday is   
 held at both,the Baptist usually in   
 the morning and the Methodist in the  
 evening.Neither holds a Sunday School.
 Each has its own minister,and both    
 form part of a collection of chapels  
 which both ministers are responsible  
 for.This year for the first time ever,
 both chapels united for the annual    
 thanksgiving service to ensure a good 
 gathering.It was held at the Methodist
 chapel in October.Next year will be   
 the Baptist's turn.None of the English
 people attend the services at these 2 
 chapels,therefore they are always held
 in Welsh.                             </content>
