		<title>13Housing Survey</title>
		<content>We carried out a survey of houses in   
Abergavenny.It was found that the most 
popular type of housing in our area was
semi-detached followed by detached,    
terraced,flats and maisonettes.        
The oldest houses were nearest to the  
centre of town dating back to Victorian
times and some even to the 18th century
As one moves out of town the houses get
younger having been built between the  
two World Wars or after 1945.The most  
modern houses have been built on       
estates around the outskirts of town   
The most common size of house was the  
3 bedroom but many detached houses had 
more while terraced houses had less.   
The most popular type of material for  
building houses was brick with four    
times as many as stone and very few    
being constructed of other materials.
