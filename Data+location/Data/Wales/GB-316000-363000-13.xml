		<title>13Cilcain/Pantymwun: Services</title>
		<content> The houses within the villages are now
 supplied with the major services of   
 mains water, sewage and electricity.  
 Both Cilcain and Pantymwyn have a     
 public-house and a general store/post-
 office, which provide basic foodstuffs
 and other supplies. Small shops such  
 as these stock only a limited range of
 products and have to charge higher    
 prices than supermarkets; there is    
 always the threat that lack of custom 
 (due to local people shopping in town)
 will force these shops to close.      
 There is a primary school in Cilcain  
 and Pantymwyn is served by one at     
 Gwernaffield, just to the east. For   
 other services,such as doctor,dentist,
 bank,larger shops or secondary schools
 the villagers must travel to Mold (6km
 from Cilcain):specialized requirements
 might entail a trip to Chester or     
 Wrexham (about 30km).                 </content>
