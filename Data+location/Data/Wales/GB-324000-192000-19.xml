		<title>19WEEKENDS</title>
		<content> On Saturday I have a lie in until 8.30
 then I have breakfast and watch T.V I 
 usually try to help my mum around the 
 house and in cooking the dinner.In the
 afternoon I often go swimming at our  
 local leisure centre,  and then       
 afterwards I go to the cafeteria to   
 buy crips  and a drink. After tea I   
 like to watch T.V or spend some time  
 drawing pictures. I usually go to bed 
 at about 8 o'clock.                   
        On Sunday I get up quite late  
 and go to meetings with the rest of my
 family as we are Jehovah's Witnesses. 
 After a nice dinner,we go to Bristol  
 to visit my Nan. We stay with my Nan  
 for tea,we often arrive home quite    
 late,so I have to go to bed straight  
 away as there is school the following 
 day.I really love my weekends.
