		<content> I am an 11 year old girl attending    
 Gilwern C.P. School.My hobbies are    
 swimming,gymnastics and stamp         
 collecting.I go to Abergavenny        
 Swimming Club on a Monday night from  
 7.50_8.30 p.m.,and I enjoy it very    
 much.I have been going to a Gym Club  
 for about 5 years.With stamp          
 collecting,my mum gave me a box of    
 stamps to get me going,and I carried  
 on from there.                        
   At school the games I play are      
 rounders and netball.We play rounders 
 on the school field.There are 2 teams,
 with an equal number of children in   
 each.In netball,I either play Wing    
 Attack or Centre.In netball there are 
 2 teams of 7 players.I have played in 
 'A'team matches against other schools.
