		<title>19The real cost of coal</title>
		<content>  Mining today remains a dangerous     
 manual job.                           
  Half a century ago, or less,the risk 
 of serious crippling, injury or       
 violent death loomed large in the     
 minds of every miners wife and family.
  Today, although cushioned against    
 the economics evils of early          
 widowhood, the miners wife slill lives
 with fear, the threat of imminent     
 redundancy.                           
  Our miners are being offered up to   
 Â£35,000  in redundancy                
 payments; Â£1,000 for each year worked 
 up to the age of 50.                  
  I spoke to a miners widow, In 1945   
 her husband was killed in a mining    
 accident. Left with four young        
 children, she recieved Â£750 in        
 compensation.                         
  Facts such as these are hidden in the
 real cost of coal.                    </content>
