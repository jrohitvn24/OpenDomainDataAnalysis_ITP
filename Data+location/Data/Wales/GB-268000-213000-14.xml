		<title>14PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> Even playground games are following   
 the advances made in modern           
 technology.  An old favourite called  
 'Crossing the Bridge' has now been    
 renamed 'Space Invaders' the rules for
 playing are as follows.               
 One person is 'on it' and he/she is   
 armed with a ball.  The rest of the   
 children line up on one side of the   
 playground.  Whoever is 'on it' calls 
 out a persons name and that person    
 must try to cross the playground      
 without being hit by the ball the     
 player throws at him.  If he is       
 successful then all the others cross  
 as well, if he is unsuccessful then   
 the person 'on it' calls for someone  
 else from the opposition.  This goes  
 on until only one person remains and  
 then that person is given the ball and
 the game begins again.
