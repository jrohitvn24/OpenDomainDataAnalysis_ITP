		<title>05LLANGURIG, ECOLOGY.</title>
		<content>  For a fairly exposed area Llangurig  
 is rich in wildlife.                  
  Birds: many large birds including    
 buzzards, kestrels, ravens and some   
 red kites. Also a few curlews and     
 plovers. Many species of small birds  
 including goldcrests, pied flycatches,
 and warblers.                         
  Animals: lots of hares foxes and     
 badgers. Plenty of rabbits, grey      
 squirrels and hegehogs. Pine martens  
 and polecats seen in forestry.        
  The river: no great quantity of fish 
 due to pollution of some sort,        
 possibly lead. Breeding salmon numbers
 down.                                 
  Trees: a fair cross-section of       
 deciduous trees but few oak trees of  
 any size.                             
  Footpaths: not enough for walkers to 
 enjoy the countrtyside. 35 trees      
 planted by school children 1979.      </content>
