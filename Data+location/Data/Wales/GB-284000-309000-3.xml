		<content> Aberangell has no mains gas supply so 
 is entirely dependant upon mains      
 electrcity for power. The village had 
 its own private electricity supply    
 (including 4 street lights), all      
 powered by the mill race on the River 
 Angell, long before many towns. But   
 the inconsistency of water flow &amp; the 
 increased number &amp; power of machines  
 made this insufficient. With recent   
 questioning of the safety of nuclear  
 energy &amp; growing awareness of the     
 world's limited resoures a few farmers
 &amp; householders examined the viability 
 of reutilizing this water power, the  
 scheme was blocked by a major land    
 owner-MP. There is one house which has
 solar panels on the roof &amp; a South-   
 facing passive solar wall. The climate
 could be more favourable but it still 
 heats much of the household's water.
