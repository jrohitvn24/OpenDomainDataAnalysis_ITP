		<title>01REVIEW OF MORFA BYCHAN</title>
		<content> Morfa Bychan,"The Small Marsh",is one 
 of the popular holiday resorts of     
 North Wales because of its two miles  
 of wide sandy beach and beautiful     
 views.Situated at the North-East      
 corner of Cardigan Bay,it enjoys a    
 mild winter.It has grown from a small,
 scattered farming community to a      
 rapidly-increasing population of about
 425.The main road from Porthmadog     
 climbs a hill giving striking views of
 sea and mountains before descending to
 the flat area by the sea,and continues
 through the village to the Black Rock 
 end of the beach.A minor road climbs  
 past Treflys Church and joins the A497
 There is a bus service,not much used  
 as most residents travel by car,to    
 Porthmadog where there are shops and  
 the railway station.
