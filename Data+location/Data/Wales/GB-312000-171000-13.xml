		<title>13St.Mary's Church, Wenvoe.</title>
		<content> In this pleasant rural setting, where 
 farmland dominates the landscape,     
 St.Mary's Church stands in the centre 
 of the community.   It is uncertain   
 when the church was actually completed
 but the first Rector recorded was {   
{Simon de Tothal}in 1350.   The present
 Rector, James Thomas, has been at     
 St.Mary's since 1976.   The tower of  
 this beautiful little church was moved
 en bloc in 1699 from the north side to
 the east for reasons now unknown.     
 There are many interesting features to
 the church which clearly reflect the  
 architectural style of the age,       
 including stained glass windows,      
 carved figures on the altar and the   
 pulpit.   The seating in the porch    
 indicates that the church was also    
 used as a school.
