		<title>08PELHAM HALL,nr.LYDART</title>
		<content> In 1923 a village collection was made 
 to buy a plot of land and build a     
 village hall. The money raised was not
 enough so the Hon.Arthur Pelham who   
 lived nearby donated Â£100 on condition
 the building was called 'Pelham Hall'.
 To celebrate the 50th anniversary of  
 the hall,another village collection   
 was made to improve facilities. An    
 extension was built for toilets and   
 kitchen,and a false ceiling was added 
 to improve heat retention.            
 The hall committee consists of one    
 person representing each of the       
 village organisations. The hall,used  
 by the W.I.,church,chapel,tennis and  
 cricket clubs and the school,has in   
 l985 been used for a ceilidh,barbeque,
 harvest supper, monthly meetings of   
 the W.I.,whist drives,jumble sales and
 the school Christmas concert.
