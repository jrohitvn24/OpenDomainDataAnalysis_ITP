		<title>16Our visit to the Roman Baths</title>
		<content> By Anthony Hill aged 6                
 On our visit to the Roman Baths we saw
 a big pool that was 41 metres long. We
 turned a corner and saw the plcce     
 where they played games We had drinks 
 and in there there was a wash basin   
 and some drains. We went up a bit and 
 saw a big  computer screen. We        
 watched it. It was showing us what the
 rooms of the baths used to look like. 
 Then we went on a bit, there was a    
 patch of paving stones and some       
 drains. Then we went to the back where
 there was a mosaic which used to be on
 the floor but now its on the wall.
