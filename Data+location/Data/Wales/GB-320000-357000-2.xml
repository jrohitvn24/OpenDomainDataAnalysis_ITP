		<title>02Farming around Eryrys</title>
		<content>  {Upland farming.}                    
  This upland area around Eryrys is    
 dominated by Nercwys Mountain which is
 covered with coniferous trees. Other  
 land around is uncultivated, often    
 because of its steepness with         
 limestone outcrops facing east and    
 west. However some land has been      
 reclaimed.                            
  Sheep are the main feature of the    
 farming, grazing on small, irregular  
 fields bounded by stone walls and     
 hedges. They are also found on fenced 
 heathland. The breeds of sheep are    
 Welsh ewes and Suffolk rams.          
  Two small herds of dairy and store   
 cattle and one goat herd can also be  
 found in this area.                   
  There is one small field of corn and 
 one of winter kale.                   
  The houses of the fairly small farms 
 have been modernised quite recently.  </content>
