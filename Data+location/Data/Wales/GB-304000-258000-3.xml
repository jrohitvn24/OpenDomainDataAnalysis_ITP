		<content> height of its popularity in the years 
 1901-14,it was not uncommon for the   
 town to receive 80,000 visitors       
 annually.After the First World War    
 decline set in,spas became less       
 fashionable and the general economic  
 depression led to a measure of        
 depopulation.It is only since 1974    
 with local government reorganisation  
 whereby Llandrindod became the county 
 town and with financial assistance    
 from bodies such as the Welsh         
 Development Agency,that there has been
 rapid expansion.                      
   Howey was more important than       
 Llandrindod and was on the main drover
 and coach route between Brecon and    
 Penybont.Today it is essentially a    
 "dormer" village for its larger       
 neighbour.
