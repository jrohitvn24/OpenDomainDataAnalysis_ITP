		<content>      The first school to be built in  
 Crynant was established in 1857 by the
 'National Society for Promoting the   
 Education of the Poor in the          
 Principles of the Established Church  
 throughout England and Wales'. The    
 method of teaching was based on the   
 cheap monitorial system, education in 
 the Three R's and Religious Education 
 depended on the payment of a weekly   
 fee, those who couldn't pay weren't   
 taught. All instruction was in English
 with Welsh being resorted to only when
 the subject was too difficult to      
 understand.                           
      A new, larger school was built in
 1907 with the older children later    
 transferring to a separate school in  
 1912. The infant and junior schools   
 were recently amalgamated into a      
 primary school in 1982.
