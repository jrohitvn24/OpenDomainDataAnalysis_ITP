		<title>12Housing in Pantymwyn</title>
		<content> Settlement at Pantymwyn really        
 developed during the 18th and 19th    
 centuries, when lead_mining was       
 important here: the name Pantymwyn    
 means 'The Valley of the Mine'. The   
 settlement then was only scattered    
 dwellings, now linked by further      
 development - particularly along the  
 roads of the area. In the earlier part
 of this century some small bungalows  
 were built; in recent years there have
 been some further small developments  
 of houses and bungalows, and some     
 large new houses have been constructed
 on individual plots. The proximity of 
 the attractive countryside here to the
 urban areas of Deeside and Merseyside 
 has also led to the establishment of a
 number of static caravan-sites, for   
 holiday use. Generally these sites are
 well screened by trees and do not     
 obtrude on the landscape.             </content>
