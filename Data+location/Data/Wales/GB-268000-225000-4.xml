		<content> This special day was during Whitson   
 Bank Holiday.The first thing I did was
 I got up at nine o' clock.Ithen washed
 and chainged and went downstairs to   
 have breakfast.I had cereal it was    
 called Smacks and a cup of tea.After  
 breakfast I went to watch Bonanza on  
 television and after it had finished I
 had a game of snooker with my brother.
 Then I went with my father and mother 
 in the car to Bonllwyn to get a bag of
 peat.After we came back my mother     
 cooked us lunch.We had potatoes,peas, 
 gravy and chicken.In the afternoon I  
 went out to the road with my brother  
 to kick the ball back and forward.Then
 Andrew Louise's brother came out so we
 went into the field to have a game of 
 soccer.I was goalkeeper first and     
 Andrew and Hefin were scoring,we then 
 took turns at scoring and saving.
