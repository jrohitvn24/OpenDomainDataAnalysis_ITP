		<content> Rachael Maddox lives in Windy Hill    
 Farm in Sardis.  She has two sisters. 
         "My mom and dad are English. I
 was born in Tamworth, then we moved to
 Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham.  We 
 only had one dog at that time called  
 Max.  We came here for a holiday and  
 we had a caravan at Meadow House      
 Caravan Site.We decided to move to a  
 little cottage at Llanteg called Fern 
 Villa.  Two years later we moved to   
 our farm.  By now we had another three
 dogs making four altogether.  After   
 we had settled down we bought animals 
 like ducks, horses, cows, calves,     
 sheep, cats and chickens.  We had an  
 orchard and a massive garden.  We     
 ploughed the orchard and planted      
 vegetables.  We have been here for    
 about six years."
