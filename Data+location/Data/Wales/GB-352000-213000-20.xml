		<title>20IN CONCLUSION</title>
		<content> This survey was carried out by the{   
{FIRST FORM}pupils of{MONMOUTH SCHOOL} 
 in{JUNE and early JULY 1985.}A field  
 day was used in order to collect the  
 land cover and amenities data. As can 
 be seen from the results the area     
 lacked variety!                       
     A large number of people and      
 organisations helped with supplying   
 information on which the text data was
 based. Visits were arranged and data  
 was slowly collected. A hearty {"thank
{you"}to all who gave their expertise  
 and advice.                           
     {The DOMESDAY PROJECT}turned out  
 to be a very interesting experience.
