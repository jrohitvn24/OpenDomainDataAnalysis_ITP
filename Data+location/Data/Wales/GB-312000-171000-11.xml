		<title>11 Wrinstone Past and Present</title>
		<content> Wrinstone lies in the NE part of      
 Wenvoe Parish, some 6.5km SW of       
 Cardiff.   The central feature in the 
 Wrinstone area is Wrinstone Farm and  
 the adjoining cottage.   The farm     
 occupies 200 acres of land, comprising
 40 acres of corn/hay, 2 acres of      
 potatoes, grazing for 100 ewes and 80 
 cattle.   The present family has held 
 the land for 45 years, but the actual 
 farmhouse dates back to the Medieval  
 Period.   This can be confirmed by    
 structural evidence revealed by       
 repairs to the south wall of the house
 some years ago.   The wall was found  
 to be 5ft. thick with a window having 
 a pointed head at first floor level.  
 Wrinstone Farm and the adjoining      
 cottage are actually built on the site
 of the old castle.
