		<title>05A Farmers Day</title>
		<content> Mr and Mrs Williams live at Pentre    
 Mill Farm. At 6.30 am the farmer gets 
 up and goes out to milk the cows then 
 at 7.00 am he wakes up the rest of the
{family.}While breakfast is being      
 prepared others are feeding the       
 poultry and dogs. After breakfast the 
 cows are moved out into the fields.   
 This is a slow job which can take up  
 to an hour. Next the sheep are rounded
 up and counted and feed then returned 
 to the fields.                        
   The food the farmer uses to feed his
 animals includes sugar beet, pulp,    
 silage,and hay. In the afternoon the  
 animals are rounded up and fed, the   
 poultry returned to the coup and the  
 dogs put in their kennels. Then the   
 farmers day is over.In the busy Spring
 and{Summer}months the farmer has to   
 find time to plough and{harvest}the   
 crop of hay and silage.               </content>
