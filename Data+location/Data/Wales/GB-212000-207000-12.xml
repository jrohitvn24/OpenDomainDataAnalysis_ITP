		<content> Claire Lugar is 8.  She lives in a pub
 in Amroth.  She says, "I help at home 
 and I go to Brownies where we play    
 games.  I like Super Gran on I.T.V.  I
 live near the seaside and it is very  
 quiet in the winter but very busy in  
 the summer months.  My favourite sweet
 is candy floss".  Sophie Turpin likes 
 chips and reading.  Alexandra lives on
 a farm.  In the mornings she helps to 
 feed the geese and the cows.  Carol   
 Neale waits for the 'bus to go to     
 school in a 'bus shelter.  She says   
 that she works hard in school and in  
 the netball team practice.  Caroline  
 Murphy's dad is the manager of the    
 Post Office in Kilgetty. Her favourite
 food is curry.  Louise Jenkins' dad   
 plays darts, football and cricket for 
 the Sports Club in Kilgetty.  She goes
 to Brownies every Tuesday evening.    
 She has to pay 20p subs.              </content>
