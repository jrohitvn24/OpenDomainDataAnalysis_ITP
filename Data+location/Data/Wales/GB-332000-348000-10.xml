		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE (cont.)</title>
		<content> Victoria, Sophie and lots of other    
 people for ten minutes and then the   
 whistle goes. When the whistle goes we
 line up in our classes on the yard.   
 Then we go in and the teacher marks   
 the register and takes the money for  
 the trips and things like that. At    
 about 9.30 we go to prayers at about  
 10.00 a.m. we come back and have our  
 English lesson. My favourite English  
 book is called Hadyn-Richards. At     
 10.40 a.m. the buzzer goes and we go  
 out to play and we have a snack. O    
 usally have crisps. At 11.00 a.m. we  
 come in and have our maths leson. At  
 12.00 we have our dinner break. I take
 a packed lunch to school which is     
 sandwiches. My favourite sandwiches   
 are salmon. At 1.00 p.m. we go back in
 and have another lesson, I like       
 drawing. At 2.20 p.m. the buzzer goes 
 and we go out and play games like tic.</content>
