 4% had other reasons.                 
 We found these results rather         
 interesting because we also went      
 around all the classes in the school  
 asking the children how many of their 
 parents had one or more car.          
 Every child in the school had a car at
 home. So it is fairly obvious to us   
 that the people who use the local bus 
 service are mostly elderly people who 
 either do not own a car or are unable 
 or unfit to drive.                    
 Our assumptiom seems quite true       
 because having watched the bus stop   
 near the school for one week, we found
 that 83% of the people who waited for 
 a bus were old age pensioners.
