		<title>15WELSH LANGUAGE IN NANTGLYN.</title>
		<content>    The area has retained its Welsh    
 language although many English        
 speaking families have recently bought
 farms and private dwellings.          
    Despite this influx, the basic     
 nature of the area has not changed.   
 The chapels are still thriving, and   
 regular Welsh services are held. The  
 Community Council conducts its        
 meetings in Welsh and the minutes are 
 produced in Welsh. The newcomers have 
 integrated very well into the         
 community and the local residents have
 accepted them.They meet often at non  
 secular events.                       
    The school has tried to retain its 
 Welshness but has recently found it   
 difficult. There are 24 families      
 represented at the school:13 are Welsh
 speakingand 11 are English.           
    In the parish 69% of the people    
 are Welsh speaking(1981 census).      </content>
