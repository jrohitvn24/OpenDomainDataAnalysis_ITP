 In a Sports survey, Sevenoaks Park    
 (172/752) was the most popular of the 
 area's amenities. Three out of every  
 four people said they used the park   
 for one reason or another. Both       
 Murches Gardens (178/755) and Jubilee 
 Park (163/758) were used by less than 
 half the people surveyed.             
                                       
 St.Patrick's Youth Centre (175/753)   
 was built in 1883 and provides several
 facilities. There is Keep-Fit,        
 Snooker, Darts, Weight-Training and   
 Football,as well as a floodlit        
 area. However only one in three said  
 they used the centre; of those who    
 did, most said they attended at least 
 once a week. Most of those who did not
 attend thought it a good idea but did 
 not have time to go there.            </content>
