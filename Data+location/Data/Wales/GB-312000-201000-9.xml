		<content> The games we play today are much      
 different to the ones that children 50
 years ago used to play.One of the     
 older games is Jack across the        
 water.One person was Jack and everyone
 else had to say a special verse and   
 then run past Jack.If anyone was      
 caught they were Jack.Another game was
 Roman Soldiers when 2 teams lined up  
 opposite each other and sang 5 verses 
 and then they started hitting each    
 other playfully as they crossed over. 
  Nowadays games are not much          
 different,but have changed just a     
 little,such as Bulldog which is nearly
 the same as Jack across the water.    
  Some games are new though,such as    
 Netball.This has 2 teams of 7.All have
 places to play.The aim is to get more 
 goals than the other team.
