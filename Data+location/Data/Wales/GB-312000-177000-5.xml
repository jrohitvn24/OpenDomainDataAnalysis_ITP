		<title>05Rookwood Hospital, Llandaff.</title>
		<content> The hospital lies on Fairwater road.  
 It is a fairly small hospital with 154
 beds, and 8 Wards, though ward 6 is   
 out of use due to improvements being  
 made. The main groups of patients are 
 pre-convelescent from other hospitals,
 spinal injuries and brain surgery. The
 hospital has 145 nurses. On a spinal  
 injury ward there should be 7 or more 
 nurses at one time; other wards have  
 less. The most common causes of injury
 are car accidents on ice and sporting 
 (rugby) accidents in winter, motorbike
 accidents and water sport during      
 summer. The main age group of patients
 are 20-30 yrs, and 60-70 yrs. The     
 hospital costs millions of pounds to  
 run: It is cheaper to cater for       
 'out patients' than those staying in  
 hospital.
