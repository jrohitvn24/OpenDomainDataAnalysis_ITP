		<content> The Welsh Language is in daily use by 
 a large proportion of the population. 
 Many older people use English only    
 when they must, and great efforts are 
 made to re-inforce the use of Welsh   
 from an early age in schools.This     
 means that most of the children are   
 ultimately bilingual.Gwynedd County   
 Council subsidises Adult Education    
 classes in Welsh.Many religious       
 services are conducted in Welsh.      
 Trefriw holds its own Eisteddfod      
 each year.                            
 Official notices,place names on sign  
 posts,public accounts such as rates,  
 gas, electricity and telephones are   
 submitted bilingually.                
 Television in this area on Channel    
 Four is not broadcast in the English  
 version, but is replaced by the       
 largely Welsh programmes of S4C.
