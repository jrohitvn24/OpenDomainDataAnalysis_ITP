		<content>The largest school in our area is      
Bassaleg Comprehensive School which has
pupils aged from 11-18.There are also 4
Primary schools in the area for pupils 
aged 5-11.Cefn Wood Primary School was 
built in 1976 to replace the old       
Rogerstone Board School;Mount Pleasant 
Primary School was built in 1975 on a  
new estate.Rhiwderin Primary School and
Bassaleg Controlled Voluntary School   
were both built in the last century to 
serve the workers on the estate of Lord
Tredegar,whose family endowed the      
original school in St.Basil's          
churchyard.Both these last named       
schools are to be merged on a new site 
at Pentrepoeth in the near future,and  
the Bassaleg school will lose its long 
association with the church of         
St.Basils.
