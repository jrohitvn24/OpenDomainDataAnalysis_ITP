		<content> When writing on "Local History" in    
 this area, the central topic must     
 undoubtedly be Coal Mining.  Probably 
 the oldest  colliery in this area was 
 the Aberaman Colliery; sinking        
 commenced in 1845 and the first coal  
 was raised in  1850.  The colliery    
 (Ref 017.004) was extremely successful
 and was once described as being "the  
 mainstay of the Powell Duffryn Steam  
 Coal Company".  The colliery was      
 closed in 1965.  The Pit Head Baths is
 now a D.I.Y. store and it stands on   
 its own, as all other remaining       
 buildings were demolished in February 
 of this year (1985). Incidentally     
 Abercwmboi translated into English    
 means "Mouth of the haunted valley.   
 The mine in Abercwmboi was opened in  
 1875 but was only ever used for       
 pumping purposes.
