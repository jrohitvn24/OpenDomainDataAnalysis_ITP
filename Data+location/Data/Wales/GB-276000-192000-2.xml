 years of age and attend{Pontrhydyfen  
{Primary School.}On a week day my      
 father rises about 7.00am and lays the
 table. At about 8.00am I get up and go
 down to breakfast. I usually have     
 orange juice, cornflakes, toast and a 
 cup of coffee. Then I go and get      
 changed and brush my teeth.           
      At about 8.35am a class mate's   
 father comes and picks me and my      
 sister up for school.                 
      Once at school we have assembly  
 at 9.05am and at 9.25am we start work,
 which is usually mathematics. We have 
 a break at 10.30am which lasts for 15 
 minutes. When we come back in we have 
 English. At 12.00 we have lunch;I take
 sandwiches. School re-commences at

 the morning or do general work such
