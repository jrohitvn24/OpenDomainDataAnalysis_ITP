		<title>03TRANSPORT SYSTEMS IN RHOOSE</title>
		<content> The Railway runs parallel with the    
 coastline and the B4265 in this area. 
 To the East another alteration was    
 made to the road system when {Cardiff 
{Wales Airport}(known to the locals as 
 Rhoose Airport!),extended its runway  
 to allow wide-bodied jets to land.The 
 resultant road loop around the airport
 has made for a fairly dangerous       
 stretch of road (There have been a    
 number of very bad accidents on the   
 bend around the airport - two of which
 cost three lives).                    
 It is also fairly unnerving to have a 
 jet aircraft fly over your head at    
 about 40m, as the group carrying out  
 this survey found out!!               
 Cardiff-Wales Airport is owned by the 
 rate-payers of S.Glamorgan. It has    
 been substantially developed during   
 the '70's and '80's.
