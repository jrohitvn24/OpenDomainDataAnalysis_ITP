		<content>{The Powysland Museum,}situated near   
 the church, was given to the town by  
 the Powysland Club in 1884. Today it  
 houses mainly exhibits from the local 
 area dating back to pre-history. The  
 museum frequently puts on exhibitions 
 of life at certain periods in recent  
 history eg.the 1950s. {               
{The Montgomery Canal}runs through the 
 centre of Welshpool and was once part 
 of the national network. Built at the 
 turn of the eighteenth century to     
 carry lime,coal,timber and cloth it   
 fell into disrepair in the 1930's. By 
 today it has been partially restored  
 and boat trips are running on several 
 stretches,including the one in town.  
 There are plans to continue the       
 restoration and complete the link with
 the Llangollen Canal at Welsh         
 Frankton.
