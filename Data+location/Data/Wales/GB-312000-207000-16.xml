		<content>In 1958 because there were no pits or  
heavy works at the north end of the    
valley the railway line closed.  It is 
interesting to note that at one time   
this line had carried the longest      
passenger train in the world - the     
three O'clock from Wylie Oakdale       
Markham.                               
Some light industries were introduced  
after the war.  Denex Crown Cork 3Ms,  
Highfield steel and Nut and Bolt.  Of  
these Denex a once prosperous clothing 
factory has left, Nut.  Bolt and       
Highfield Steel no longer exist, but   
the remaining two are at this moment   
still flourishing.  However like so    
many light industries they employ more 
female than male labour and is very    
small numbers in comparison to Heavy   
Industry.
