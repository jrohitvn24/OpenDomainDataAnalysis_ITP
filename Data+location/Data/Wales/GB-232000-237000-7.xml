		<title>07THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 8th May our Headmaster took
 us to the local Telephone Exchange. It
 is a fairly new building about 100    
 metres from the school - it was built 
 in 1975. We were met by Mr. Richards  
 who was in sole charge of the         
 building. He also looks after four    
 other exchanges in the area.          
 What impressed me most was the        
 computer which controlled the timing  
 of all the calls and stored all the   
 information about the Bank Holidays   
 and weekends, when the calls are      
 cheaper. It was amazing how it worked 
 -all the information was fed into it  
 at the beginning of the year and the  
 it kept a complete check on all the   
 pricing of calls for the year.The     
 exchange serves a vast area from      
 Cwmduad to Rhydlewis and all the      
 surrounding villages.  It was a most  
 enjoyable and educational visit.{GAVIN</content>
