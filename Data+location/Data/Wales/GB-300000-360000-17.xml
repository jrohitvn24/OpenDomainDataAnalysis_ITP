		<title>17FARM SURVEYS AT NANTGLYN 2</title>
		<content>    Other farming studied followed a   
 similar pattern,except that the       
 farms were run by Welsh families. One 
 of the largest was 104h. with up to   
 900 sheep Dominant land use was       
 improved pasture with hay grown on 1/3
 to 1/5 of the land. Average density   
 was 8 sheep per hectare.              
    None of the farms employed labour  
 except for shearing which was a       
 combination of family,friends and     
 contractors!                          
    All the farms had tractors,hay     
 makers,fertiliser spinners,and        
 mowers.Beef cattle were a common      
 addition, Welsh black and Hereford    
 cross being common breeds. Most felt  
 that the future for farming was good  
 but complained that grants had gone   
 down.
