		<title>17Vandalism</title>
		<content> The survey was undertaken by a 14year 
 old pupil who covered every street in 
 Cilfynydd looking for evidence of     
 vandalism to property.There was       
 visible vandalism,such as broken      
 windows etc.The two telephone kiosks  
 had been defaced by graffiti as had   
 the bus shelters.Vandalism was        
 evident on the school and street signs
 Graffiti was seen on every            
 lampost,litter bins and walls.Benches 
 had also been attacked which resulted 
 in them being damaged and             
 defaced,litter was everywhere in the  
 streets which are most widely used by 
 shopkeepers.Generally there was a good
 deal of evidence of mindless vandalism
 and graffiti but a lesser ammount of  
 vandalism.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
