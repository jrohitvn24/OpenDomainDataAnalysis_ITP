		<content>Abergavenny is situated in an area     
of outstanding natural beauty.If you   
look to the North,West or South the    
nearby hills and mountains provide the 
background.The Sugar Loaf,the Blorenge 
and the Skirrid mountains are all      
within two miles of the town.          
Lying at the southern edge of the      
Black Mountains and close to the       
Brecon Beacons,Abergavenny has become  
a popular holiday centre.People come to
enjoy the countryside and activities   
like hill-walking,pony-trekking,caving 
and canoeing attract many people.      
Enthusiasts of the relatively new sport
of hang gliding have found that the    
Blorenge is an ideal site for their    
activities.The River Usk and its       
tributaries,which includes the River   
Gavenny,offer good salmon and trout    
fishing.
