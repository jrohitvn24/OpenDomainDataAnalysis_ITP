		<content> Farming nowadays is not very          
 profitable.Most farmers rely on       
 tourism.                              
 The farmer in New Hedges lets two of  
 his fields to tourists. His other     
 fields are used to grow crops, and to 
 make silage. Some farmers have changed
 their dairy cattle to  beef cattle.   
 Now the E.E.C. say that the farmers   
 have to get rid of some of their own  
 cattle because there has been a 10%   
 reduction in the milk quotas.That     
 means that the animals either have to 
 be sold or be killed.                 
 There are coniferous forests around   
 the coast between  Saundersfoot and   
 Tenby which can be used for building. 
 Near the woods are beautiful fields   
 and hedges which encourage wildlife.
