		<content> sea-plane base in the world.The naval 
 side of it revived a little with their
 work on the mile wide submarine net   
 which spanned the Haven.In 1960 the   
 R.A.F.left the dockyard and it began  
 to run down once more.It's main       
 present day function is to service the
 missile range at Aberporth.There are  
 now just 170 people employed          
 there,with only 1 naval officer and   
 various civilians such as             
 engineers,shipwrights,carpenters,fitte
 rs and riggers.There is also a special
 diving unit(see next page).In spite of
 it's rundown the jetty is still used  
 on 320 days of the year and with the  
 Â£4,000,000 a year it costs to run and 
 the average salary of Â£200 per week it
 is still a very important contributor 
 to the economy and way of life of the 
 town of Pembroke Dock.
