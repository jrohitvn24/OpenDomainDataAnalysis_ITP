 scouts and he established the Observer
 Corps in Pencoed in l938 but they were
 originally called Special Constables.

 changed a great deal since Mr. Watkin 
 was young but he prefers it as it is  
 to-day with electric light, public    
 sewers and a water supply to each     
 house.                                
      Mr. Watkin was awarded the       
 M.B.E. in l966 for services to sport  
 and the Observer Corps.  Mr. Watkin   
 was the last blacksmith in Pencoed.
