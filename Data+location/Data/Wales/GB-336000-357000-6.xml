		<content> Station Road is the main shopping road
 in Rossett.  Here was the original    
 primary school.  The site is now a car
 park. Nearby is the Spar supermarket. 
 This has taken the place of a separate
 post office and village shop.         
                                       
 The railway station has been closed   
 but there is a manned level crossing  
 where the Wrexham-Chester line crosses
 the road to Llay.  Nearby is a        
 reserved area of track where the Royal
 Train stays overnight when a member of
 the Royal Family makes a visit to the 
 North Wales area.                     
                                       
                                       
 A large house on the main raod through
 Rossett was the home of Russ Abbott   
 before he moved to London.  He is a   
 famous comedian.
