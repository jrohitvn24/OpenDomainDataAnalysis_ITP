		<content>  The Women's Institute holds monthly  
 meetings throughout the year with     
 speakers both educational and         
 entertaining. There are craft and     
 cookery demonstrations, and an annual 
 fund- rasing effort each July.        
 Proceeds from this are shared between 
 a chosen charity and Institute funds. 
 Proceedings are bilingual, but a      
 wholly Welsh meeting is held each     
 March. Average membership is thirty.  
  Merched y Wawr is an organisation    
 similar to the Women's Institute but  
 proceedings are wholly in Welsh.      
 Membership averages thirty five.
