		<title>06Rounders on Garway Common</title>
		<content> Every Tuesday evening (weather        
 permitting) there is rounders on      
 Garway Common. People turn up from as 
 far afield as St.Weonards. The age    
 range is from 8 years to about 60. The
 equipment is kept in a nearby person's
 garden shed. The grass is cut and the 
 pitch marked out by the locals with   
 the Sports Club equipment. The game is
 great fun and is not played to win.   
 Most of the adult players are women,  
 but men join in as well. In the summer
 we can keep playing until around 9    
 o'clock. Opposite the Common there is 
 the Garway Moon Inn, which is very    
 convenient. All players are very      
 welcome wherever they have come from. 
 Although sometimes the sides aren't   
 fair it doesn't really matter. Usually
 there are enough people to play 7 a   
 side.                                 
                                       </content>
