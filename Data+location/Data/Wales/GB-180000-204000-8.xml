		<title>08Dale C.P. School</title>
		<content> Our school is a junior and infant     
 school;the children come when they are
 4 and leave when they are 11.There are
 2 classes.There are 16 children in the
 top class and 15 in the bottom.We have
 got a new P.E. teacher and a new      
 teacher in the bottom class.We learn  
 Maths.,Reading,Writing and English.We 
 have got two classrooms which are     
 temporary wooden buildings.We used to 
 have 3 but we made the first one into 
 a dinner hall.The hall is 110 years   
 old and is made of old red sandstone. 
 We have also got a playground and a   
 school field,but in the winter we     
 cannot go in the field.Of the 31      
 children in our school,17 come by bus 
 from Marloes,2 miles away, and 14 come
 from Dale.Sometimes we go on trips to 
 do fieldwork.(We have learned about   
 boat moorings,animals in the sea and  
 about Carew Castle in this way).      </content>
