		<title>04POST OFFICE _ LITTLE MILL</title>
		<content> When the shop in the village closed   
 two years ago, the Post Office which I
 manage became the focal point of local
 life.Senior Citizens collect weekly   
 pensions and mothers their family     
 allowances from me.Mail for           
 distribution worldwide is posted here.
 I sell postage stamps,television      
 licence and telephone saving stamps.  
 The Girobank is used by many as a     
 convenient way to pay Rates,Water     
 Rates and various other bills.        
 Withdrawal of money from Giro accounts
 is especially useful on Saturdays when
 most banks are closed.Saving schemes  
 of Certificates and Premium Bonds are 
 all available even though the Post    
 Office is small.We sell stationery and
 confectionery from the shop too so we 
 are a cenrral meeting point in the    
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
