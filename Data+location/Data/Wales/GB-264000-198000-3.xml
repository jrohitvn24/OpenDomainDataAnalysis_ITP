    Most of the children at{Glyncollen}
 school live in recently built "Wimpey"
 houses.Children at{Ynystawe}school    
 live in a variety of houses .Some are 
 Victorian terraced houses or Edwardian
 villas,others are modern detached or  
 semi-detached houses or relatively new
 bungalows.                            
    Many Morriston houses were         
 condemned in the 1930's and           
{Cwmrhydyceirw}was chosen as the site  
 of a housing estate which rehoused    
 those in need.                        
    The M4 interchange at Ynysforgan   
 is very useful for commuters,and as a 
 result housing is taking up more space
 than ever before:this is probably one 
 of the fastest growing areas in       
 Swansea as far as housing is          
 concerned.
