		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SUZANNE</title>
		<content> I wake up in the morning when mum     
 calls me at 7:45a.m. I dress and go   
 downstairs for breakfast of toast.I   
 wash,clean my teeth and make sure I   
 have everything for school. I wipe the
 breakfast dishes and then my mum is   
 ready to drive me and my little sister
 to school about 1\ miles away.School  
 starts at 9:00a.m. and there we work  
 very hard.We have dinner at midday.At 
 3:30p.m. school ends and mum or dad   
 picks us up.I change from my school   
 clothes into working clothes and find 
 dad.He's usually fiddling with things 
 in the field,like fixing gates and I  
 help him.At five o' clock I fetch the 
 cows for milking and help during      
 milking by turning the handles to let 
 the milk through the pipes into the   
 tanks.We finish milking at 6:30p.m.I  
 watch some television programmes      
 before I go to bed at 9:00p.m.        </content>
