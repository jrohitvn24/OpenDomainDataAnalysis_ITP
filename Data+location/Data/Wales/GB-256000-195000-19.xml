		<content> Gareth Roberts is a local man who is  
 also a Welsh international rugby      
 player.He attended school in Gowerton 
 and as a result of playing for the    
 school team,played rugby in New       
 Zealand before he was 18.He started   
 playing rugby at 11 years of age and  
 was good because of his immense size  
 even at that young age.               
      He won his first Welsh cap during
 the 1985 season against England at    
 Cardiff Arms Park in Cardiff.He told  
 us during our interview with him that 
 it was a very proud moment for him to 
 walk out in front of 67,000 people,but
 also a very nervous one.He also told  
 us that the ability to speak Welsh to 
 some of his team mates was a great    
 advantage,especially playing against  
 England.It is very special to have a  
 Welsh player living in our area and a 
 great thrill to have met him.         </content>
