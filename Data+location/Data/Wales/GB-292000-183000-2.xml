		<title>02Our Village.</title>
		<content>  I like living in Heol-y-Cyw because  
 it is situated in such lovely         
 countryside. Everywhere you look there
 are fields full of gorgeous flowers   
 and plants. On a warm summer evening  
 you can often see wild animals ,      
 especially in the woods on the eastern
 side of the village. There is plenty  
 of room to play. The roads are quiet  
 and there is little traffic, so we can
 ride our 'bikes in comparative safety.
  Although the village is small and    
 lacks the amenities of larger villages
 and towns,the nearness of Pencoed and 
 Bridgend and the fact that most       
 families have a car does, not make    
 this too much of a problem.           
  The houses are quite attractive and  
 comfortable and most have been built  
 during the last fifty years.
