		<content>  Many of the younger generation feel  
 that there is not enough              
 entertainment.                        
  There are discos on a Friday at      
 Llanelwedd,just outside Builth;it     
 costs about Â£1.50.On a Saturday       
 evening discos are occasionally held  
 at the Strand Hall, in the centre of  
 town.                                 
  A cinema is available at the         
 'Wyeside'Theatre,on the eastern side  
 of town.As well as films being shown, 
 pet shows are held as well as live    
 music,poetry and plays.               
  Older people go to the pubs,to bingo,
 or to "Country and Western" evenings, 
 which are held monthly in the         
 Greyhound Hotel.                      
  There is one pub outside the town,   
 the Prince Llywelyn, at Cilmeri.
