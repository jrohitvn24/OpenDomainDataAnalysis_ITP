		<title>09Pontllanfraith Health Centre</title>
		<content>    The Health Centre is near the Civic
 Centre. It was built to serve the     
 people of Pontllanfraith and          
 Blackwood. It is a modern building    
 made of yellow brick with a sloping   
 roof.                                 
      There are seven doctors, all men.
 They are McSharry, Noble, Hussain,    
 Sahni, Sabah and H.M.Hussain.         
      The centre has four waiting      
 rooms, for the doctors, dentists,     
 pharmacy and optician. There are seven
 clinics and a nurse.                  
      The results of a survey carried  
 out by the school show that the       
 centre's busiest day is Thursday. Six 
 doctors have a surgery  on this day   
 and four of the clinics are open.     
 Friday is also a busy day because of  
 the baby clinic. Wednesday is the     
 quietest day as there is only one     
 doctor on duty.                       </content>
