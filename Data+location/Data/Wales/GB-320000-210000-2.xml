 School.The first Head Master was      
 called Mr Jeffrey Railton and there   
 was 75 children when he taught.       
  Our Head Master now is called Mr     
 Roberts he teaches the classes 3 and

 is called Mrs Williams who teaches the
 classes 1 and 2.She takes us for

 little bits of raw meat and pondweeds 
 and little minute bugs.
