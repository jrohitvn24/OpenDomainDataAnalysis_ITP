		<title>01PORTHMADOG INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>  Located at the NE corner of Cardigan 
 Bay,the area includes most of the town
 of{Porthmadog,}the village of         
{Borth-y-Gest}and most of{Minffordd.}  
 Nearly half the area consists of the  
 wide sandy estuaries of the rivers    
 Dwyryd &amp; Glaslyn, and much of the rest
 is low-lying wetland recovered from   
 the sea by the Cob, a stone embankment
 spanning the Glaslyn estuary.It       
 carries the main road through the     
 area,still subject to a toll,and the  
 Festiniog Railway.Except for a few    
 farms,virtually all development in the
 area post-dates the building of the   
 Cob and Porthmadog harbour in the     
 early 19th century.                   
  Porthmadog is now the commercial and 
 shopping centre of a wide thinly-     
 populated area;tourism is its main    
 industry,its harbour used only by     
 pleasure boats.                       </content>
