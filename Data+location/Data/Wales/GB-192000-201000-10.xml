		<title>10Pennar Park Holidays part 1</title>
		<content> Pennar Park {holiday village}is       
 situated where it is because it is    
 built on the site of an old army camp 
 whose function it was to protect the  
 surrounding Haven.As the camp is water
 sport orientated the fact that it has 
 the sea on 3 sides proved ideal.They  
 receive an average 5 to 6 thousand    
 visitors a year drawn mainly from the 
 Welsh valleys and the Midlands with as
 many as 8 to 9 thousand in a good     
 year.The average cost of a holiday    
 there is Â£150 so the effect on the    
 local economy is quite                
 substantial.Water sport facilities    
 include a sub-aqua lake plus a        
 resident instructor to train divers   
 and 12 moorings for boats to ferry    
 diving clubs to suitable locations.We 
 asked what there was to amuse children
 and were told:-Lots of                
 entertainments,fancy dress parades,   </content>
