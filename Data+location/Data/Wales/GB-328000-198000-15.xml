 high unemployment rate so more people 
 now find themselves with extra leisure
 time.                                 
   Pontypool Park,originally the       
 grounds of the Hanbury family home was
 acquired for the town in 1920.The     
 house is now a school whilst the park 
 contains the stadium for the renowned 
 Pontypool Rugby Football Club,a dry   
 ski slope,sports centre,and play      
 area.The ski run consists of brushes  
 laid over a grassy slope with a drag  
 lift to aid the skiers' ascent.       
   The leisure centre offers sports as 
 diverse as subaqua diving,judo,rock   
 climbing,gymnastics,snooker,swimming  
 and many others for a modest fee.The
