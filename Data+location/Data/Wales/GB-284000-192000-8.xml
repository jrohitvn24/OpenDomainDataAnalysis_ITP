		<content> A{Gymanfa ganu}is a{Welsh hymn singing
{festival.}This year the eight welsh   
 schools which feed{Llanhari Welsh     
{comprehensive school}met on the 27th  
 of June at Salem,{Pencoed}for a       
 Gymanfa which was enjoyed by us all.  
 We arrived there by bus and there was 
 a man called Mr. Evans outside the    
 chapel telling us where to go. We went
 up a small staircase with a red carpet
 then we were on the balcony with over 
 400 other children. There were        
 sopranos on one side and altos on the 
 other side. There were 9 new hymns to 
 learn and we knew all the words by    
 heart. We enjoyed the Gymanfa very    
 much, we behaved well and we made many
 new friends.
