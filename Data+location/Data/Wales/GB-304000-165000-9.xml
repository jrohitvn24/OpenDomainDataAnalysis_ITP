		<title>09SPORT IN RHOOSE</title>
		<content> Rhoose has always had a strong        
 football tradition. The{Rhoose Social 
{Club}has always been involved with    
 running a teams at Junior and Senior  
 levels in both local and regional     
 levels. Until two seasons ago the Club
 had a successful side in the South    
 Wales Amateur League. The same        
 organisation has worked hard at       
 developing a thriving{Boxing Club     
 which now attracts members from       
 outside the confines of Rhoose itself.
 The other Social Club has been set up 
 under the auspices of the Airport. It 
 used to be called the Cambrian Club,  
 then the British Airways Club. It is  
 now known as the Cardiff Wales        
 Airport Club. They too run teams in   
 local leagues. The changes in name    
 serve to reflect the changing fortunes
 of Trade and Industry in the area as  
 companies come and,more frequently go.</content>
