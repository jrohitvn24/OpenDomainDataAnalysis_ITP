		<title>16Buildings in Garway</title>
		<content> Altogether we identified 92 inhabited 
 houses within our 12 square kilometre 
 block. We received 59 replies to our  
 questionnaire, and one outright       
 refusal.                              
       Of these 59 buildings, only 3   
 were erected within the last five     
 years. 8 were between 5 and 20 years  
 old, and 13 others (mostly 'Fairview',
 the council houses) were built this   
 century. The majority, 35, date from  
 at least the last century, and in some
 cases very much earlier.              
       40 people were able to set a    
 date, exact or approximate, to their  
 houses. In cases where more than one  
 date was provided (e.g. because of    
 extensions) we have taken the earlier.
 One house is claimed as 14th century  
 in origin, one 16th century, three    
 17th century, one 18th century and    
 thirteen 19th century.                </content>
