		<title>11CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW A55</title>
		<content> There's a lot of large machines like  
 scrapers, bulldozers,cranes and       
 trucks.They use these to build the    
 road. Some of the machines are new;   
 some of the workers are trained       
 away but some are local. There are    
 some foot-bridges to cross the new    
 road.People from away are paying      
 locals to clean the work base.They    
 also pay them for bed and breakfast.  
 Based on the site are the large       
 construction companies like Costain,  
 John Jones and Clwyd County Council.  
 John Jones supplies the machines.     
 They get all the stone they need from 
 the local quarries. As there are a lot
 of old mine shafts in the area they   
 need special machines like scrappers  
 or rippers.                           
  They hope to complete the road by    
 September 1986.
