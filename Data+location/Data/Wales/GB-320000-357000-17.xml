		<title>17South West Nercwys - History</title>
		<content>  The major portion of this area was   
 owned for centuries by the Nercwys    
 Hall and Plas Ucha estates. In the    
 early 20th century both estates sold  
 their properties, now almost all farms
 and houses are owner-occupied.        
  The common land was used for hare    
 coursing until the enclosure act 1831,
 when the lower parts of the Common    
 were enclosed with parallel boundaries
 of stone wall and hedge as seen today.
  The houses and buildings are welsh   
 stone and slate, some built in the    
 late 17th century. Plas Ucha farmhouse
 and barn were built in the 17th       
 century. Plas Ucha cottage, stone with
 thatched roof, has now been extended. 
 Llewelyn farmhouse, with its own      
 private chapel, was built of stone    
 in the 18th century.                  
  The Orangery at Nercwys Hall is an   
 1813 Gothic building.                 </content>
