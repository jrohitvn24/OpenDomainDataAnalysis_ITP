		<title>16Star hamlet.</title>
		<content> I live in Star which is a small       
 hamlet.It has only nine livable       
 houses.I live at one end of the hamlet
 in a house called Pendre.Pendre is    
 Welsh for head of the village.The Ship
 which is a terraced house was once a  
 public house and a chapel before they 
 built the chapel on the hill.The Falls
 is a pub and next to it is the river  
 Cneifa,which runs through the village 
 and has lots of fish.There were three 
 mills in Star in the past,a woollen   
 mill and two grain mills.The          
 Falls,which was the old wollen mill,  
 still has its old water wheel in the  
 stream.The water wheel was used to    
 generate power for the mill.Bush      
 Cottage,next door to us,used to be an 
 old police station and a shop.It      
 burned down some years ago and a new  
 house was built on the site.Steven    
 Thomas lives there now.               </content>
