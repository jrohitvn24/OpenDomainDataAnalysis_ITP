		<title>07THE JAZZ BAND IN CWMGORS</title>
		<content> THE LOCAL JAZZ BAND IS CALLED CWMGORS 
 VALLEY TROOPERS.I STARTED IN THE BAND 
 WHEN I WAS 10 YRS OLD. OUR TRAINER'S  
 NAME IS KEN DAVIES. WE HAVE FIVE      
 COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO HELP TO RUN THE 
 BAND.                                 
 THE BAND STARTED IN 1980 AND NOW THERE
 ARE 32 MEMBERS AGED BETWEEN SEVEN TO  
 EIGHTEEN. IN THE AUTUMN WE DO NOT     
 COMPETE SINCE MOST BANDS, LIKE US, ARE
 PRACTISING FOR THE SUMMER EVENTS.     
 WHEN I STARTED I WAS PLACED BEHIND THE
 DRUMS AND LATER WHEN I COULD KEEP IN  
 STEP I WAS PUT INTO THE LAST RANK.THEN
 AS I IMPROVED I WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER  
 THE COMPETITIONS.                     
 AFTER BEING IN THE BAND FOR NEARLY ONE
 YEAR I HAVE MANAGED TO COMPETE IN     
 FIFTEEN COMPETITIONS AND WON FIVE     
 MEDALS.
