		<content> At this eastern end of the Vale of    
 Glamorgan there is a scattered farming
 community with separate isolated      
 dwellings. There are clusters of old  
 houses and cottages at St Lythan, St  
 Lythans Down and Dyffryn. There is a  
 small group of council houses just    
 south of St Nicholas. At Wallston, on 
 the Western edge of Wenvoe village    
 there are modern detached houses      
 occupied mainly by people who commute 
 to Cardiff for employment. All        
 inhabitants have to go outside the    
 area for amenities, such as schools,  
 shops, libraries, health centres etc. 
 At Dyffryn there are two buildings of 
 particular interest, a large private  
 house which retains a moat, and a     
 beautiful thatched cottage typical of 
 many such dwellings in the Vale.
