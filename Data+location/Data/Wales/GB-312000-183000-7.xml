		<content> The block surveyed included Caerphilly
 Common.   The main coverage was       
 uncultivated heathland.   There was   
 also a large proportion of coniferous 
 trees surrounding the disused quarry  
 areas.   It was very wet underfoot,   
 due to swamp regions that had recently
 been drained.   The majority of houses
 in the area were modern, but Cwmwbwb  
 Lodge and Twyn-y-Gwaw Cottages, which 
 were built in the nineteenth century, 
 are still present.                    
 Although there was no indication of   
 mining on our map, we were told by a  
 local old man, that there was a       
 coalmine present up to the nineteen   
 twenties.
