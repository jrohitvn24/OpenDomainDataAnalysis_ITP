		<title>03LAUGHARNE, TOWN AND AROUND</title>
		<content> The present appearance of Laugharne   
 stems from the 18th and 19th Centuries
 but its Church and Castle at each end 
 of the main street denote 13th Century
 origins. Laugharne has two areas -    
 'up-street' being the area between the
 Church and Castle House with most of  
 the best buildings, and 'down-street',
 focussed on a once busy port with     
 cottages and merchants houses around  
 the site of the Quay and warehouses.  
 Laugharne was designated an           
 Outstanding Conservation Area (1971)  
 due to its Castle and precincts,      
 ancient street plan, waterfront, and  
 Georgian/Regency houses.  Besides good
 views from the hills, the estuary, the
 Strand plus fine buildings, the town  
 also has eyesores which depress the   
 overall standard of the Township.
