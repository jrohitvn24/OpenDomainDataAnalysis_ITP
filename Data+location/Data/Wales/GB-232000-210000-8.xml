		<content> All the larger dairy farms milk in a  
 parlour and smaller ones still milk in
 the traditional cowshed. 90 per cent  
 milk into a pipeline which transfers  
 the milk to a bulk collecting tank for
 cooling. Tankers collect daily, taking
 the milk to the Milk Marketing Board  
 creamery at Carmarthen for cheese     
 manufacture. Producer retailers supply
 milk to each village. If snow makes   
 farms inaccessible, farmers transport 
 milk in emergency tanks to central    
 collection points. Dairy cattle are   
 all either Fresian or Holstein. Most  
 dairy farms rear replacements mainly  
 using artificial insemination. Many   
 also keep a beef bull, Hereford or    
 Charollais or their crossbreeds. All  
 dairy cattle are winterhoused in      
 cubicles or cowsheds. Grass silage and
 hay are basic winter feed, with only 4
 farms growing barley for livestock fee</content>
