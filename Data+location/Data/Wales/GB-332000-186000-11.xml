		<title>11ANIMAL SHELTER. NEWPORT.</title>
		<content>      Near to our school, Hartridge    
 Comprehensive, is the{Ringland Animal 
{Shelter.}This is run by the{R.S.P.C.A.
 and is the place in Newport where all 
 stray or lost animals can be taken.   
 The majority of animals there are     
 dogs, but usually there are cats too. 
      When a stray animal is found it  
 is taken to the shelter and put into  
 runs with other animals of the same   
 type. It is fed and looked after for a
 week. During this time its owner can  
 come and collect it after paying a    
 fee. If the owner does not collect the
 animal then it is humanely destroyed. 
      Other people go to the shelter to
 choose a new pet. Once again they have
 to pay a fee, but the animal is       
 checked over to see that it is healthy
 before they take it away.
