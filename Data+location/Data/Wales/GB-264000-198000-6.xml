   The B.M.X. track is dangerous       
 because when you go over the jumps you
 skid on the gravel and sometimes you  
 go to hospital with nasty side        
 effects.                              
   My friend Christopher came off his  
 bike and he had to go to              
 hospital.He had two stitches in his   
 right arm.                            
   The jumps on the track are good     
 because you can have races against    
 each other.It is{dangerous}when you   
 turn into each other.                 
                  by Darren Walsh.     
 note:The nearby{woods}have been turned
 into a bicycle track as children were 
 riding their popular stunt bikes on   
 the streets.Some believe that the     
 ground wil be eroded and are unhappy  
 about the scheme,others want the track
 to keep children off the streets.     </content>
