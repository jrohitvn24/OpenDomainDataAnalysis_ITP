		<title>19SPECULATION INN</title>
		<content> The proprietors of the Speculation Inn
 are Mr and Mrs Nelson. The building   
 has been in use as an inn for the past
 125 years. Sold on the premises are   
 beer, wine, spirits and snack foods.  
 The inn can cater for about 80        
 customers. There is a part-time       
 cleaner and bar-staff members are     
 occasionally employed in addition to  
 the Nelsons.                          
 The inn usually has about 50 customers
 a night, made up of both local people 
 and tourists. The busiest time is in  
 the summer 'tourist season', and the  
 poorest month for business is January.
 For entertainment the inn provides    
 background music, darts and           
 card-games.
