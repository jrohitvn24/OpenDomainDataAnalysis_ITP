		<title>17ONE DAY AT MOLD BATHS</title>
		<content> On Saturday 8th June, 1985 I woke up  
 quite late.  I watched No. 73{        
{(Recreation)}while having breakfast.  
 Then my mum and dad went to Leo's to  
 buy some food.  My sister went to see 
 our cousin and I phoned my friend.    
 When my mum and dad came back they    
 said we could go to Mold baths.  We   
 had a quick lunch, soup, bread and a  
 packet of crisps and we went to the   
 baths.  My dad dropped us at the baths
 then went home.  I bought some goggles
 for Â£1.90. In the baths there was a   
 big inflatable monster.  It was       
 red and yellow and you had to try to  
 climb onto it.  When we got out of the
 baths we went upstairs for something  
 to eat.  My dad drove us home then we 
 had chips, pizza and peas for tea.  We
 watched Kenny Everet and I went to bed
 after Dynasty and I read my books.{
