		<content> Gareth Garstang has recently moved to 
 Stepaside.  He writes "We moved down  
 with another family that we knew.  My 
 brother has trouble with his chest    
 especially in the damp of Warrington. 
 I have been on holiday here before and
 I think that it is very nice.  My mum 
 and dad decided to move down because  
 of my brothers chest.  We live in     
 Pleasant Valley.  I have found that   
 everybody takes his time here and     
 nothing has to be exact.  The first   
 few weeks I thought I was on holiday. 
 The school is very different from my  
 old school which had 300 pupils.      
 Moving here has been a different kind 
 of life."  Yan Garstang is eight and  
 likes going fishing and his house is  
 called Cherry Grove.  The family is   
 going to have bed and breakfast in    
 their new house which has l4 rooms.
