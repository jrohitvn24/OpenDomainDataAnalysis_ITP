		<content> The Sennybridge Farmers' Hunt is based
  upon the village.  This pack of      
 foxhounds is hunted within a radius of
 about 15 km of the village. The pack  
 is composed of long-haired Welsh      
 foxhounds,  which are immensely shaggy
 and quite unlike their counterparts of
 the English lowlands.                 
                                       
 The River Usk is an important salmon  
 amd trout fishing river.  The waters  
 between Sennybridge and Abercamlais   
 are all in private hands but permits  
 to fish part of them may be obtained  
 from a shop  in the village.          
                                       
 Canoeing may be enjoyed in autumn and 
 winter after the end of the fishing   
 season.
