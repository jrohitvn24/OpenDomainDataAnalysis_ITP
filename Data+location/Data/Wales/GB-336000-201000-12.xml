		<content> USK AND RURAL AREA - HOME OWNERSHIP   
 Many houses in this block are         
 privately owned.  In the rural area   
 are farms, some standing on old       
 original sites, modernised country    
 cottages, and later private housing in
 Wainfield Lane, Gwehelog.  Houses from
 the Victorian era, 1920's, 1930's and 
 postwar years are on the outskirts of 
 Usk.  Council Estates at Llancayo,    
 Gwehelog and Ladyhill (outskirts of   
 Usk) have less people renting their   
 houses today, because, as sitting     
 tenants, they have been able to buy   
 their homes at a favourable price as a
 result of recent Government           
 legislation.  The majority of houses  
 in the Agricultural College area are  
 owned by the Gwent County Council and 
 are let to staff and workers at the   
 College.  There are some bungalows on 
 the Abergavenny Rd,and Llancayo.      </content>
