		<title>10Housing Estate, Bettws</title>
		<content>   When a large housing estate was     
 planned about{1960,}Bettws was an     
 excellent site to choose.             
  The agricultural land there was      
 undulating, affording good views of   
 the surrounding countryside.Clumps of 
 trees have been left to{landscape}the 
 various open spaces within the estate.
    The{design}of the{houses}varies.   
 Some houses are in rows,others in     
 pairs. There are also small blocks of 
{flats}and{maisonettes.}Many of the    
 houses have little sheds built-in next
 to their front doors.Around the edge  
 of the estate there are now small     
 groups of{privately built houses.}    
  The small{shopping centre}provides   
 most essential commodities although   
 litter and vandalism spoil it.
