		<content> The Pencoed Royal British Legion Band 
 has twenty five members not including 
 our two percussion players and our    
 conductor. We have approximately fifty
 Instruments. Our concert band can     
 contain any number of players because 
 there is no limit to its size. We also
 have a beginners class and are        
 starting a Junior Band. The           
 subscription for each member is fifty 
 pence a week. Our rehersal premises at
 the moment are opposite the Kings Head
 Public House in Pencoed. This year the
 Waldsassen Band from our twin town in 
 Germany came over and we performed a  
 joint concert in the Welfare Hall. One
 of our best performances was at a     
 concert in the Royal British Legion   
 for Armistice night.
