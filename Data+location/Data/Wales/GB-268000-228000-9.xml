		<title>09LLANGADOG RACES.</title>
		<content> For the past 100 years, trotting and  
 galloping races have been held in the 
 village on Easter Monday.Years ago,   
 the races were held on the road, but  
 later moved to a field by Bran River  
 and are now held at Pen y Bont field. 
 Dr Huw Walters J.P.and County Coroner 
 has been the chairman of the committee
 who organises the races for the past  
 35 years.About ten races are held     
 during the afternoon and large crowds 
 come from far away to watch the       
 racing.The horses are handicapped by  
 weight in the galloping races,and in  
 the trotting races,the horses are     
 handicapped by time.The jockey either 
 sits on the horse or in a light two   
 wheeled carriage pulled behind the    
 horse.Many people bet on the results  
 of the races and the field looks very 
 colourful with all the tents,marquees,
 horse boxes and spectators.           </content>
