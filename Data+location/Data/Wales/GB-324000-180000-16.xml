		<content> There is a variety of housing in our  
 area.Many of the detached houses are  
 individually designed, some dating    
 back to 1800.Some of the very old     
 houses are farm houses or farm        
 buildings which have been             
 modernised.The oldest houses are built
 of stone,the newer ones are brick and 
 cement rendered.                      
 In 1977 a large Terrace of 3 and 4    
 bedroom council houses was built      
 Almost every house has a              
 bathroom,inside toilet and central    
 heating.All of the houses have a      
 garden,some with vegetable plots,     
 orchards and flowerbeds others with   
 lawns and shrubs.                     
 Garden furniture like swinging seats, 
 hammocks,benches and sun loungers are 
 popular.Play apparatus like climbing  
 frames,swings and slides can be found 
 in many gardens.                      </content>
