		<content>    The only mains fuel readily        
 available is electricity. Locals don't
 find this very economic. Despite this 
 7 out of the 18 interviewed said that 
 they used electricity as their main   
 fuel supply. A majority said they     
 would use gas, if it were on mains.   
 The main fuel supply normally included
 that used for regularly heating the   
 house and the water. Oil was used by  
 3 people, in most cases because it was
 already there when they bought their  
 property. Most small cottages used    
 rayburns which heated the rooms,      
 water and for cooking. Wood was almost
 as popular as electricity probably    
 because it comes in a good supply and 
 is reasonably cheap locally. Almost   
 half of the people interviewed used a 
 secondary sorce of fuel i.e. log fire 
 or calor gas heater for either        
 economic or ornamental reasons.       </content>
