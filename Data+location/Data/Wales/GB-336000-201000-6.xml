 Usk College of Agriculture runs       
 courses for male and female students  
 (16 years and over).  Some students   
 are residential, other are day release
 students and on a Government Youth    
 Training Scheme.  The college runs its
 own farm including arable, dairy,     
 sheep and pig farming.  There are     
 courses in Horticulture, Beekeeping,  
 Home Economics and Farm Secretarial   
 Work.  There are tennis courts and a  
 rugby pitch for students.  Usk Primary
 and Junior School and Community Centre
 was opened in February 1985, when the 
 local church school closed.  Children,
 7-11 years, local, and from the       
 villages of Glascoed, Gwehelog,       
 Llantrissant and Llangibby, where the 
 schools have closed, are bussed in
