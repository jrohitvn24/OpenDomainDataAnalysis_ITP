		<content> The castle is one of a series of great
 castles built during the reign of     
{Edward 1}to overawe North Wales in the
 days of Llywelyn,last prince of       
 Wales. The castle was {completed      
{around 1280.}The castle is concentric,
 with a low outer wall, inner ward     
 approximately square,set diagonally to
 the points of the compass,gatehouses  
 with twin towers to the East and West.
 Despite conservation work which has   
 been undertaken since 1947, the castle
 appears extensively ruined. Following 
 siege during the Civil War, the castle
 was intentionally ruined, and became a
 quarry for building materials. The    
 results can be seen in neighbouring   
 houses.                               
 The castle is open to the public from 
 March to October and during July 1985 
 2,099 adults and 1,192 children and   
 pensioners visited the site.          </content>
