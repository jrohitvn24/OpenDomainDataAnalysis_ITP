		<content> Agriculture is the main employment of 
 the area.  Most of the land is owned  
 by one landowner and many of the farms
 are tenanted.   They vary in size, the
 average being about 200 acres.   The  
 farms combine a mixed form of         
 agriculture with small milking herds, 
 sheep, pigs and arable land.   The    
 main crops grown are wheat, barley and
 oats, some potatoes and oilseed rape  
 and peas are grown on the Home Farm.  
 The River Elwy valley is fertile but a
 great deal of the land south of the   
 river is on the slopes of Mynydd Gaer 
 which is used for sheep grazing.  Most
 farmers grow fodder to feed their     
 animals in the winter.  This is in the
 form of barley, both grain and straw, 
 hay silage and swedes.  Most of the   
 wheat, oilseed rape and peas are sold 
 out of the area.
