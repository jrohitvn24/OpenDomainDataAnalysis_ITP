		<title>08THE LEISURE CENTRE</title>
		<content> The chairman of the Leisure centre is 
 a local teacher,Mr. Alun Jones.The    
 Leisure Centre was originally built as
 a woollen mill, then used as a        
 warehouse during the Second World War 
 and subsequently. In 1981 plans were  
 drawn up to convert it into a sports  
 complex and social club, and this     
 work commenced in 1982. It is run by  
 a Management Committee made up of     
 volunteers from the area.The Centre   
 provides a range of sporting          
 activities in an area which lacked    
 facilities and requires the support of
 the local community to make sure the  
 facilities offered at the Centre are  
 maintained. The facilities offered are
 Squash,Badmington,Table Tennis, Eight 
 Ball Pool,Pin Ball, Indoor Bowls,     
 Judo, Japanese Sword Fighting, as well
 as Keep Fit and Aerobics Classes.
