		<content> The first question the community      
 police were asked,was what was the    
 peoples reaction to the police in     
 1985.They told us it was very good    
 after the miners strike.Most of the   
 police live locally,and regulary visit
 boy's clubs.The nearest court is in   
 Bargoed a town 3 miles up the valley  
 from Pengam.Serious offences are dealt
 with at Cardiff Crown Court.There are 
 no police dogs kept locally but one   
 could be reached in 15 minutes.There  
 is one main police station at Ystrad  
 Mynach,two miles south of Pengam.More 
 policemen walk the beat than use cars.
 There is some vandalism,but the       
 biggest problems are burgularies and  
 damage to property.The busiest time is
 after 11 o'clock on Friday and        
 Saturday nights.There have been few   
 accidents and the impression is that  
 motorists drive fairly well.          </content>
