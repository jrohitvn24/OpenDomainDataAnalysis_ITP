		<content> All the churches in the survey area,  
 with the exception of the small Church
 in Wales (Anglican) Mission Church in 
 River Lane, Cymau, are{Non-Conformist 
 Churches with the largest proportion  
 being those of the Presbyterian Church
 of Wales.                             
  Since 1967 the local Presbyterian    
 minister, J.Curig Thomas, has had     
 charge of six churches, including the 
{Welsh}language churches in Cymau and  
 Ffrith, and the English language      
 Bethlehem Church at Cefnybedd.        
 Mr.Thomas feels that he is fortunate  
 to have churches in a geographically  
 compact area, but stills finds his job
 very demanding.                       
  He believes the Welsh language       
 churches perform an important role in 
 keeping alive Welsh in an area        
 becoming increasingly anglicised.
