		<title>01Rural Powys in the 1980's</title>
		<content> Our survey area is located in the     
 heart of rural Mid-Wales. It is in one
 of the largest counties in Britain    
 called Powys.The land is almost       
 exclusively{farmland}which is         
 intensively managed grassland.The land
 all lies between 200 metres and 475   
 metres above sea level.               
           As is often the case in     
 rural communities the very limited    
 number of amenities are concentrated  
 in a very small area- in fact they are
 all to be found in the one square     
 kilometre that contains the village.  
           Many of the needs of the    
 inhabitants can still be satisfied    
 within the village,though increasingly
 people look outside to larger         
 communities such as the nearby town of
 Newtown for employment,recreation and 
 shopping.
