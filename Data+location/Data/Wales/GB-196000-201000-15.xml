		<title>15A COSHESTON CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> I am a ten year old boy. I get up at  
 7.3O each morning, clean my teeth,    
 dress and have cereal for breakfast.  
 Next I feed the dog, cat and the      
 rabbit, then my mum takes me to       
 Cosheston village school in the car. I
 enjoy maths and English and I have    
 school dinners every day.             
    There are three classes in our     
 school and the children are aged from 
 four to eleven.                       
    At 3.4O I come home from school and
 watch T.V. After that I have to do my 
 homework. Then we have tea.Sometimes  
 I go out to play with my friends on   
 our bikes. On Mondays I go to cubs in 
 the village hall and on Thursdays I go
 to judo at the Youth Centre in        
 Pembroke Dock.                        
    At 8.3O I have to go in, then I    
 have my supper which is toast. After  
 that I have to go to bed.             </content>
