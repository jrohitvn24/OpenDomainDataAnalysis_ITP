		<content> There is a site of a Roman villa 400m 
 south of Stowe Farm, but nothing is   
 visible above ground, and no detailed 
 archeological excavations have been   
 made. 1\ Km north of Stowe Hill is an 
 ancient British hill-fort known as    
 Caer Caradoc after the Saxon chief,   
 known to the Romans as Caractacus, who
 led resistance against the Romans and 
 local tradition says he made his last 
 stand within the defensive walls of   
 the camp before being captured. The   
 steep approach on the north-east and  
 south sides, and the three grass-     
 covered earth walls and ditches rising
 to 6\m and enclosing an oval area of  
 400 x 250 m are still an impressive   
 monument of engineering that has      
 lasted for 2,000 years.
