		<title>15A Day On A Farm.</title>
		<content> I am a farmer, I wake up about 6:30am,
 go down stairs, have some breakfast   
 and then go and get dressed. Then it  
 would be time to milk the cows. The   
 milking process would take place twice
 a day.The collecting would take place 
 in the morning, but the milk is kept  
 in a large vat which would be         
 refrigarated so that it could be      
 collected any time of day.Before I    
 milked the cows I would feed them     
 first with hay, silage or grass. Then 
 I would go and cut the grass for      
 silage. It can be hard work in the hot
 weather.I would then go in, sit down  
 and make a plan of a rotation for my  
 farm. I would do a 4 year rotation.   
 First I would grow potatoes,then      
 grain, then grain and last of all I   
 would grow grass.Then I would go in   
 for my lunch. After that I would feed 
 the cows and milk them.               </content>
