		<content>   I live in Bradley's Stores,it was   
 built in 1907 and has a 300ft.bench   
 mark on the brick work and a Victorian
 post box in the wall.The village      
 changed tremendously in the 1900's.The
 electric street lights replaced gas in
 1924.Horse and cart was used to       
 deliver goods until just before the   
 war.By 1961 the colliery tip was 140ft
 high and dominated the village.It     
 covered Babell Row and threatened     
 Babell Chapel.In 1964 the colliery    
 closed and in the 1970's the tip was  
 flattened.On the mountainsides are    
 numerous fields separated by dry stone
 walls in which sheep  still graze.On  
 top of Mynydd y Grug is a spoil heap  
 from Bedwas Colliery closed this year 
 after the 1984-5 Miners Strike and    
 which split the community in Cwmfelin.
 I enjoy living in Cwm,I like its      
 pretty,picturesque surroundings.      </content>
