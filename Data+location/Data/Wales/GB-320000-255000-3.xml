		<title>03THE VILLAGE OF GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> The population is about 200 in        
 Gladestry Parish. The centre of the   
 villge is quite small. There are about
 36 houses in the centre. The church is
 called St Mary's. Not many go to      
 church. The Rectory is by the Church, 
 but now it used for bed and breakfast.
 The village hall is used for dances   
 plays and parties. Our pub's name is  
 the Royal Oak. It is very busy some   
 nights. The Baptist Chapel has a      
 service once a month. Mostly old      
 people go. The Methodist Chapel is now
 a house. Our shop and post office is  
 in the same building. Not many people 
 buy from there because it is cheaper  
 in the Kington shops. The school is   
 105 years old and there are 27        
 children there at the moment.
