		<content>3. Chartist caves.                     
   So called because they were used by 
the Chartists to make weapons and      
bullets before the March and to hide in
after.  Also to the north of Trefil,   
still in existance but unsafe.         
4. Cholera Cemetry.                    
   To be found alongside the existing  
Cefn Golau Cemetry.  It is in a state  
of disrepair but still illustrates the 
extent of the cholera epidemic that    
struck the town in 1849                
5. The Sirhowy Iron Works.             
   The Sirhowy Iron Works now partly   
excavated and forming part of the      
heritage trail.                        
6. The Blocks of Coal in the park.     
   The larger 15 tons cut by "Colleir  
Mawr" for the 1851 exhibition, the     
smaller two tons cut from the hinda    
level for the 1951 exhibition.
