		<content> IN THE AFTERNOON SOMETIMES I HELP OUT 
 AT THE FARM, WRITING DOWN THE EAR-TAG 
 NUMBERS IN A BOOK WHILE MY HUSBAND    
 SORTS THE CATTLE AND HERDS THEM FROM  
 FIELD TO SHED HOLDING THEM STEADY     
 WHILE THEY ARE RECEIVING MEDICATION.  
 AT 4 P.M. THE CHILDREN RETURN HOME FOR
 TEA. THEY HAVE A COOKED TEA. THE CHIPS
 ARE COOKED IN THE DEEP FAT FRYER. IN  
 THE SUMMER THEY PLAY IN THE GARDEN.   
 THE BOY PLAYS WITH HIS TOY CARS THE   
 GIRL SKIPS AND PLAYS HOP-SCOTCH. I    
 FEED THE DOG WITH THE TINNED DOG FOOD.
 IN THE EVENING WE WATCH T.V. I        
 SOMETIMES SEW OR KNIT. NOT ALL WOMEN  
 STAY HOME ALL DAY, SOME HAVE PART-TIME
 WORK OR FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT.         
 A MOBILE LIBRARY VISITS THE AREA ONCE 
 A FORTNIGHT.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
