		<title>11EMPLOYMENT in RHAYADER</title>
		<content> Rhayader is isolated from the main    
 industrial areas,is not near a motor- 
 way and is,therefore,not considered   
 viable by most industries.Light       
 industry encouraged by the Mid-Wales  
 Development Board include a firm      
 making paper files and employing 90%  
 women together with other single unit 
 workshops.These workshops usually only
 only employ 2-5 people and change     
 hands often once the various induce-  
 ments offered by the Development Board
 are finished.There is also a factory  
 making high-speed,precision gearboxes 
 for aerospace,industry and M.O.D.use  
 which employs 60.Tourism generates a  
 large proportion of jobs particularly 
 in the summer months. Apart from shops
 which generally only employ part-time 
 workers and farming the other main    
 employer is Local Government with most
 employees working out of the area.    </content>
