		<title>01THE LOCATION OF AMMANFORD</title>
		<content>  Ammanford is set between the Betws   
 and the Black Mountain. The town      
 derived it's name from the river      
 Amman. The people used to cross the   
 river at a ford.                      
  The Amman's source is the Black      
 Mountain but it is nearing it's end in
 Ammanford because it joins the river  
 Loughor just south of the town.       
  The Amman meanders through Ammanford 
 and at Pontamman it's force is causing
 concern, so the authorities have      
 strengthened the bridge.              
  There is a concrete weir across the  
 river near Betws Park. The river flows
 on southwestward to join the Loughor  
 at Two Rivers,Pantyffynon. The Loughor
 is very strong in Pantyffynon and it's
 meanders have eroded local farmland.  
  Both rivers have been straightened a 
 little and their banks strenghtened,  
 to reduce the risk of flooding.       </content>
