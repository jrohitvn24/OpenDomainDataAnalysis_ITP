		<title>16Rabbit Farming</title>
		<content> This was started commercially in      
 Presteigne by Mr.Garner in 1983.He has
 two types of{commercial rabbits:      
 Californians and NewZealand whites,   
 totalling about 4000- 5000 rabbits at 
 any one time.They are raised from     
 birth to a market weight of 5-6 lbs.  
 In the winter,the rabbits sell at 42p 
 per pound, in the summer at 30p per   
 pound.They are sold to a packer       
 (Midland County Packing Company)in    
 Evesham for export to the continent,  
 although the home market is expanding 
 now. Rabbits are sensitive to stress.}
 During Broadheath races next to the   
 farm,Mr.Garner lost 35 rabbits due to 
{noise stress.Disease}is prevented by  
 putting the rabbits in separate wire  
 cages and feeding once a day, and     
 the shed is  cleaned out once a month.
