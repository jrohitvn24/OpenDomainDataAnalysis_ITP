		<title>10Quarrying near Eryrys.</title>
		<content>  Burley Hill Quarry occupies an area  
 of about 16 hectares in the north west
 of the block. The quarry is at least  
 pre-war and may be much older.        
  High grade limestone is quarried     
 here, it is removed by controlled and 
 monitored blasting and carried by dump
 trucks to be crushed and graded into  
 size. It is used in the construction  
 industry and for the production of    
 tarmacadam. The stone is carried from 
 the quarry in lorries to areas        
 including Clwyd, Merseyside, Cheshire,
 Greater Manchester and the Midlands.  
  The equipment at the quarry is very  
 modern and has cost Â£4.5 million over 
 the last seven years. The quarry is   
 about 20-30m deep but will become     
 deeper with futher extraction.        
  The quarry employs about 25 persons, 
 some from the immediate area and also 
 provides work for local lorry drivers.</content>
