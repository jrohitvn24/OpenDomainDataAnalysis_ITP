		<content> Formerly the property of the Mansel   
 Talbots, it was acquired by the County
 of West Glamorgan in 1973.  The area  
 contains the historic nucleus of a    
 park of 840 acres.  Sites include: an 
 Iron Age Hill Fort, Margam Castle,    
 Margam Orangery, the remains of a     
 Cistercian Abbey, and outside the park
 the Abbey Church.                     
 The park has marked walks, picnic     
 sites and extensive ornamental        
 gardens.  Also present is a sculpture 
 park, a maze and adventure playground 
 for children, putting, pony riding,   
 fishing, Fantasy village and boating. 
 The Coed Morgannwg Way, a long        
 distance country walk, links the Park 
 with Afan Argoed and Craig Y LLyn.    
 Approximately 250,000 people visit the
 park annually though in 1985 numbers  
 dropped sharply due to the wet summer.
