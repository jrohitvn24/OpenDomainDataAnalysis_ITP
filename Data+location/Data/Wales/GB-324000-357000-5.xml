		<content>  Unemployment is rather high in this  
 area especially for men as local jobs 
 go mostly to women.                   
   About three quarters of the adults  
 are working and just a few people are 
 self-employed.Most people work        
 outside the village which means they  
 travel at least five miles to work,   
 usually by car.Agriculture, building, 
 manufacturing,education and services  
 are the most common occupations and   
 nearly everyone works full time.      
  Half of the unemployed have never had
 any previous jobs and almost everyone 
 say that they do not receive enough   
 money.
