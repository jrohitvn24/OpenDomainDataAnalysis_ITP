		<title>04NATURAL HISTORY IN TRELAWNYD</title>
		<content> The varied geology of the area, with  
 hills and valleys, allows for a rich  
 local ecology.  Since farming and     
 forestry are the dominant features of 
 the landscape it is not surprising    
 that many local people are interested 
 in natural history.                   
 There is a splendid variety of wild   
 flowers along the road and lane       
 verges, and a wide range of birds.    
 All types of indigenous Hawks and Owls
 are present.                          
 Some like Curlews and Plovers arrive  
 in Spring, Woodcock and Crossbills are
 residents.                            
 All of the smaller mammals, except    
 deer and wildcat, are present, but    
 seldom seen in daytime. Bats, lizards,
 snakes, frogs and toads are seen in   
 the spring and summer months.
