		<content> My name is Alison, I am 19 years old  
 and I{work}at Lawrence Preston        
{Electronics}on the{Wonastow Industrial
{Estate}as an electronic board         
 assembler,manufacturing radios and    
 computers.                            
 It takes me 10 mins. to get to work by
 car. I start work at 8.00 with a      
 coffee break at 10.15, then on to     
 12.30 when I have my 1/2 hour dinner  
 break. Sometimes I eat my sandwiches  
 in the car, or walk to the nearby     
 shops with my friends. There is a     
 short afternoon break and I normally  
 finish work at 4.30 but sometimes work
 on to 5.30, but then I get stuck in   
 traffic jams.                         
  Although I completed{training}as a   
 typist I was unable to get secretarial
 work, anyway this job is better paid  
 and I was glad to work after being on 
 the{"dole"}for two years.             </content>
