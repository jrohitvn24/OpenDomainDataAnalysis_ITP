		<content>    Glanaman School celebrated its     
 centenary year in 1984 and the school 
 has seen many changes, both structural
 and curricular, during its history.   
    Pupils between the ages of 5 and 11
 are taught by 5 teachers. As well as  
 receiving bilingual education in      
 academic subjects, pupils are         
 encouraged to take part in a wide     
 variety of sports and games, such as  
 netball, rugby and swimming. In       
 addition, most pupils have the        
 opportunity of attending field weeks  
 at the environmental centre at Pendine
 as well as taking part in various     
 local studies and school outings.     
    Pupils are provided with school    
 dinners prepared on the premises,     
 (current price 65pence per day) or    
 they may opt to bring in their own    
 packed lunch.
