		<title>13BODFARI DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> The cows are bought to the shippen at 
 about 6.30 a.m.The milking machine,   
 which works by a vacuum process is    
 connected to the cows udders; the milk
 travels along the pipeline to the     
 farm's dairy.There the milk passes    
 through a filter and is collected in  
 the tank which holds  115 gallons.    
 The milk tanker arrives at the farm   
 once every day to collect the milk and
 take it to the Creamery at Llandyrnog.
 Once a week the milk is tested to     
 determine its quality (GRADE A,B,C or 
 D). The better the quality the more   
 the farmer receives for the milk.     
 Quality can be improved by good       
 feeding of animals and cleanliness    
 of equipment.The pipeline is cleaned  
 with an acid wash and the tank is     
 washed in water and iodine.
