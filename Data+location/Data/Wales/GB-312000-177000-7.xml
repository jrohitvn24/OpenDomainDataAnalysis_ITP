		<content> Fairwater Leisure Centre was          
 officially opened on the 8th of       
 February 1985 by Stefan Terlezki, the 
 local M.P. There is a wide range of   
 sports of which the most popular are  
 swimming and badminton. Other         
 activities are bowls, tennis,         
 football, table tennis, volley ball,  
 net ball, and trampolining. About 750 
 people use the centre per day. The    
 centre costs Â£1.5 million to build    
 and is not finished yet. It employs 18
 full time and 20 part time workers. It
 is owned by Cardiff City Council.     
 There are no membership cards to use  
 the centre, you pay at the door. There
 is a Cafe and a bar upstairs. The     
 centre is also used for concerts and  
 discos.
