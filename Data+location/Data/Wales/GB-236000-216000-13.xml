		<content> The farmer is dependent on elements   
 for its basic prosperity. The summer  
 of 84 ws very hot and dry and the     
 summer of 85 has been one of the      
 wettest on record. All entrances to te
 fields and around the farm yards are  
 puddles  to mud by clover hooves. In  
 the barns good silage is scarce,      
 During 1980-84 farmers in the area    
 were able to buy hay from other parts 
 of the country but 1985 has been      
 different.                            
 The whole country has suffered        
 prolonged rain through the summer     
 Carving cows have been hit by the     
 disease known as Staggers. The farmers
 have been warned that there is a real 
 danger of contract Farmers Lung unless
 they take strict precautions when     
 handling mouldy hay.
