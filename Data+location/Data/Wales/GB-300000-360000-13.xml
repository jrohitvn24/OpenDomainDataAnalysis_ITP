		<content>    The main event of the year is the  
 Agricultural Show.It is organised by  
 the Young Farmers and is always held  
 on the last Thursday of August.This is
 a large effort for a small village and
 about 2000 visitors attend,it is a    
 great time for family re-unions.      
    All entries must be from within 6  
 miles of Nantglyn. There is a large   
 entry for sheep with 11 sectionsfor   
 Hardy Welsh, 7 for Suffolks and many  
 for other breeds.Cattle and pony      
 sections are very popular.            
    Women's interests are encouraged by
 Merched y Wawr, which ensures a high  
 standard of entry.                    
    Early evening is the time for sport
 ranging from the flat race for under  
 6's to the 1 mile open. A recent      
 addition is the best trick on a BMX   
 bike.The evening ends with a disco in 
 the chuch house.                      </content>
