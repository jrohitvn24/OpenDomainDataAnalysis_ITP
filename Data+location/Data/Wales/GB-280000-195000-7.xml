 the villagers. The village shop is    
 there - a tiny building with only the 
 most basic of stock.{The Rugby Club}is
 in Danycoed, as is the{Pelenna        
{Community Centre}.

 surgery, as a clinic, for bingo,      
 discos and any village function . In  
 Tonmawr proper is the{Post Office,    
 which also has a minimal stock of     
 other items.. a cigarette machine,    
 sweets crisps and bread are more or   
 less all it sells. A small children's 
 play area (a swing and a see-saw) is  
 available in Tonmawr, while in        
 Danycoed is a large adventure         
 playground. A small corrugated steel  
 chapel -{The Mission}stands at one end
 of the village. (see page 9)          </content>
