		<content> Plans to use this area as a dumping   
 ground for nuclear waste raise violent
 protest from all sections of the      
 community. The threat persists and a  
 watch is kept for signs of activity.  
 The Dyfi valley is used as a training 
 ground for low flying aircraft which  
 create a terrifying noise, interfere  
 greatly with radio &amp; TV reception &amp;   
 disrupt lessons at 2 schools which the
 younger children of Aberangell attend.
 Dumping of rubbish on the banks       
 disfigures the rivers which are       
 otherwise clear &amp; clean. The ending of
 the yearly collection of large items  
 can only make matters worse. Fish are 
 steadily decreasing in numbers. It has
 been suggested that large scale       
 forrestation may poison the rivers but
 it may be that forestry drainage      
 methods cause too rapid a rise &amp; fall 
 in the water level.                   </content>
