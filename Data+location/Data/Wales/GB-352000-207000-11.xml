		<content>{House exteriors}in 1945 were similar  
 to those today.{Inside}they were very 
 different. Now most are{centrally     
{heated,}though some are still heated  
 by{coal fires}as then. Kitchens today 
 are better equipped with micro-wave   
 ovens,automatic washing machines,     
 dryers and food mixers.Kitchen{gardens
 were big and lawns and flower         
 beds small.Now the reverse is usually 
 true.The{school}had a large garden at 
 the King's Head Hotel. In 1945 there  
 were three full time teachers and     
 three{classrooms.}Now there are two   
 teachers and two larger classrooms.   
{Evacuees}from London and Hastings     
 increased the number of children in   
 Redbrook School during the war. In    
 1945 most of them returned home.      
 Children from Gwent were then allowed 
 to come to the school.Later they could
 not, but now they can again.          </content>
