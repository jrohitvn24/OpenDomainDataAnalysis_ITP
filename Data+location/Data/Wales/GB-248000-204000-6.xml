 two years or more.A pupil this year is
 to go to the comprehensive a year     
 early.For the year 1985-1986 ten 4-yr 
 olds are expected to be admitted.A    
 nursery class meets three times a week
 The usual range of subjects are taught
 and the school has a computer which   
 all classes use.There is an annual    
 sports day and on St.Davids day a     
 concert is held for parents.There are 
 Urdd activities,this being a Welsh    
 youth movement.The Head likes the     
 children to be confident and          
 encourages self-reliance like         
 -answering the phone.The schools motto
 is "Dysgwn y ffordd i fyw" which means
 to learn the way we live.             </content>
