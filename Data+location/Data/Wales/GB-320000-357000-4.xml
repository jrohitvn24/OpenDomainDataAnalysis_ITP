		<content>   This is a thriving agricultural     
 area, with computerised milking       
 parlours installed on some of the     
 larger family farms. Milk is collected
 by bulk tanker, every dairy farm has  
 to comply with the strict regulations 
 governing the production and          
 collection of milk. Adequate roads    
 have to be maintained to ensure the   
 bulk tankers access to the farm. Most 
 farms have their own machinery and    
 equipment for ploughing, hay making,  
 silage cutting and collecting, but use
 contractors for combine harvesting,   
 silage baling and hedge cutting.      
  The sheep are sheared by contract    
 shearers. The wool is collected by the
 wool marketing board from one         
 collection point.                     
  Stock is taken to the weekly         
 livestock markets at Mold, Ruthin and 
 Chester. Special sheep sales are held.</content>
