		<title>15THE LOCAL BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content> I started my career as a self-employed
 blacksmith in the spring of 1947.The  
 work of the farm horse was declining, 
 as tractors took over, and I spent my 
 first few years making small farm     
 implements and rimming cart wheels. By
 the end of the decade the process of  
 converting and adapting horse drawn   
 machinery to tractor work had started,
 machines such as the hay cutter,      
 spreader,ploughs,ridgers, and other   
 implements. At first I did not possess
 an electric welding machine, so all my
 work had to be done on the forge fire.
 I later bought a power drill,iron     
 sawing machine,grinders and other     
 machinery for my own special needs.My 
 work has changed and increased a great
 deal. Today ornamental work is on the 
 increase and I am as busy as ever     
 making ornamental gates,railings,doors
 etc. for local craftsmen.{MR.W.DAVIES </content>
