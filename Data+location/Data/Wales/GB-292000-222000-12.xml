		<content> During the nineteen fifties and       
 sixties the Usk River Authority       
 explored the possibility of creating  
 a reservoir in part of the Senni      
 valley.  This scheme was finally      
 abandoned in 1973. It seems unlikely  
 that the proposal will be renewed with
 -out considerable local and national  
 opposition.  The National Park Plan   
 published in 1977 has argued strongly 
 against further reservoir construction
 within the Brecon Beacons National    
 Park.   The period of uncertainty     
 about the future of the valley        
 obviously affected farming practice,  
 resulting in a period of inaction     
 when there was not much long-term     
 improvement carried out on either     
 land or buildings.Many smaller        
 cottages were at that time sold for   
 use as country cottages or "second    
 homes".                               </content>
