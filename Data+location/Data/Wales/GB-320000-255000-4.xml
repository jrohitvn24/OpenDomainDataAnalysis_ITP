		<title>04HOUSES IN GLADESTRY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> We did a survey of Gladestry. We asked
 the name of the house and the people, 
 their work, the age of the house, and 
 if they were local or from off. We    
 counted 42 houses. Of the houses 19   
 were built this century. The others   
 were a hundred to five hundred years  
 old. Some of the very old houses start
 to fall down, and rich people from off
 buy them and repair them. There are   
 some new bungalows. The newest ones   
 have stone tile roofs so that they    
 fit in with the old houses. There is  
 a big new bungalow with 18 rooms and  
 a swimming pool. There are some       
 council houses which were built for   
 people who could not afford to buy a  
 house, but most of these have been    
 bought by the people who live in them.
 An unusual house is Capel Anydd which 
 is made from an old chapel.
