		<title>09A School Day.</title>
		<content> Today is Tuesday.I get up at eight,   
 get dressed and then  have breakfast. 
 My friend comes for me and we go to   
 school.The bell goes at five to nine, 
 we go in and the teacher takes the    
 register.Most mornings we have        
 mathematics first,then have some milk 
 at twenty five past ten,then we have a
 break for a quarter of a hour.From    
 then until dinner time we have        
 English,but on a Tuesday we have Welsh
 at half past eleven.We have one hour  
 for dinner.We pick what we want off   
 the menu.At one o'clock we go in,that 
 is when we have environmental work.At 
 ten to two we go by bus to Connah's   
 Quay Baths,by the time we return to   
 school the home time bell goes at a   
 quarter past three.Sometimes we have  
 homework.
