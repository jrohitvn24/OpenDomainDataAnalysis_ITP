 lot of traffic in Trefnant especially 
 in summer when the holiday makers go  
 through on their way to Rhyl, but the 
 villagers don't seem to have any      
 objection to this.                    
 Although Mr Williams is officially    
 retired, he still runs the farm and he
 used to be very busy. He used to be   
 Mayor of Trefnant in 1980-81, he has  
 also been on the Colwyn-Aled Rural and
 Parish Councils. He has been to       
 Buckingham Palace a number of times to
 the Garden Parties, Princess Anne has 
 also been to his house, so have Prince
 Charles and Princess Diana.           
 Trefnant is situated between two      
 rivers, the Elwy and the Clwyd, they  
 run on and join in Rhuddlan then they 
 go into the sea.
