		<title>18Recreation Swimming - School</title>
		<content> Three mornings every week I get up at 
 07.00 for morning training sessions at
 the pool.  I normally swim about 80   
 lengths (2,700 metres) during this    
 session.  I come home from the pool at
 08.40 and get to school by 09.15.     
     When the bell rings we go to      
 assembly. Then we have morning lessons
 of English, Maths, and Welsh.  In the 
 afternoon we have Art, Needlework,    
 Geography,Religious Education, Project
 Work and Games.                       
     My evening training session starts
 at 17.30.  We do a variety of things  
 such as leg kick,arm pull,full stroke 
 and Individual Medley, and one length 
 sprints,breathing once every length.I 
 also swim about 80 lengths in the     
 evening.  I get home at about 19.00,  
 worn out, but happy.
