		<title>11OGMORE LOWER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> IN 1909, A NEW SCHOOL WAS BUILT       
 IN FAIRY GLEN, WYNDHAM, CALLED THE NEW
 HIGHER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. INITIALLY,  
 ONLY SIX TEACHERS WERE APPOINTED,     
 LATER JOINED BY A TEACHER FOR CRAFT   
 AND COMMERCIAL SUBJECTS.  BY SEPTEMBER
 164 PUPILS-78 BOYS, 86 GIRLS WERE     
 ADMITTED, DRAWN FROM COUNCIL SCHOOLS  
 IN THE NANYMOEL AREA. EVEN IN THOSE   
 DAYS, PIT STRIKES AFFECTED THE SCHOOL,
 THE LOCAL COMMITTEE PROVIDING HOT     
 MEALS FOR MINER'S CHILDREN IN NEED.   
 SEVENTY-FIVE,YEARS LATER,THIS STILL   
 THE CASE.                             
 THE SCHOOL IS NOW PART OF OGMORE      
 COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL.IT CATERS FOR    
 FORMS ONE AND TWO COMPRISING OF 316   
 PUPILS.UNFORTUNATELY,NUMBERS ARE      
 FALLING LARGELY DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF 
 THE PITS AND LOCAL INDUSTRIES. DUE TO 
 DECLINING ROLES, THE LOWER SCHOOL IS  
 EXPECTED TO CLOSE WITHIN FIVE YEARS.  </content>
