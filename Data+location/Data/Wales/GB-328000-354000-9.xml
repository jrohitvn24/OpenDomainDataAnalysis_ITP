		<content>{Brownies:}Abermorddu Brownies were    
 formed in 1969 since when there have  
 been a number of Brown Owls (leaders).
 The present Brown Owl is Mrs.Ann      
 Griffiths. The Abermorddu Brownies    
 consist of a pack of 24 girls between 
 the ages of 7 and 10 who are organised
 into four sixes called Imps,Elves,    
 Gnomes and Pixies. In each six there  
 are a sixer, a second and four others.
   Brown Owls assistant, Tawny Owl, is 
 Mrs.Edwards.                          
   Once a Brownie has said her promise,
 she pays 30p a week to attend the     
 weekly sessions (held at Abermorddu   
 School from 6:30 to 8 p.m. on         
 Wednesdays).                          
  At these there are games to play,    
 things to make and a variaty of badges
 to be gained.Occasionally they go on  
 trips. At the age of ten, many        
 Brownies leave to join Guides.        </content>
