		<title>01The Cilcain/Pantymwyn Area</title>
		<content> This area, around the villages of     
 Cilcain and Pantymwyn, straddles the  
 upper valley of the River Alyn to the 
 west of the town of Mold.             
 The area is predominantly pastoral    
 farmland, but the river and streams,  
 woods and the higher ground of the    
 Clwydian Hills rising to the west give
 the landscape a scenic quality, which 
 has long attracted ramblers and       
 nature-lovers. Many educational visits
 to the area are also made both by     
 local schools and by groups staying at
 the nearby Colomendy Environmental    
 Studies Centre.                       
 The major local industries are        
 agriculture and limestone quarrying,  
 but many residents commute to work    
 outside the immediate vicinity. Both  
 the villages have expanded with the   
 construction of new housing, and      
 support an active social life.        </content>
