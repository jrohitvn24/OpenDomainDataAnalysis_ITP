		<content> Trawsfynydd is a small village of     
 about 600 inhabitants serving a large 
 agricultural community.  This is an   
 area of upland farming with extensive 
 tracts of moorland.  The lowest point 
 being at 750 feet.  Very little change
 has taken place in the last century.  
 The architecture of the area remaining
 predominantly local stone although    
 newer buildings are rendered in order 
 to comply with National Park          
 regulations.  Some afforestation has  
 taken place in areas of very marginal 
 land.  The major source of employment 
 being sheep farming apart from the    
 local power station.  Tourism has not 
 figured strongly in this area yet.
