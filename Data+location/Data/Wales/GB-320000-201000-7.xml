		<title>07A Local Colliery.</title>
		<content> The Six Bells Colliery is one of the  
 last ,few surviving coal mines in the 
 western valley of Gwent.It is quite an
 old pit and there has been talk that  
 it might close in a few years time.It 
 is very noticeable in the valley as it
 has two sets of winding gear,both of  
 which are painted blue.Most of the    
 miners live in the villages of Six    
 Bells,Aberbeeg and Llanhilleth,which  
 are all fairly close by.On Tuesday    
 28th June 1960,twenty five years      
 ago,there was a terrible explosion in 
 the pit.Forty five miners were killed 
 and part of the pit was destroyed.It  
 was one of the worst mining disasters 
 in Wales and is still remembered by   
 local people today.
