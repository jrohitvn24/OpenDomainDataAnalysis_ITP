		<title>14CILFFRIW,A WELSH VILLAGE - 2</title>
		<content>     The most interesting shop in my   
 village is the{Post Office.}It is a   
 small,homely place and it sells       
 sweets,birthday cards,and almost      
 anything you want. Some of my friends 
 sell papers from this shop. The       
 building is about{60 years old.  }    
    There is also an interesting chapel
 in Cilffriw,called{Pisgah Chapel.}It  
 was erected in 1930 and there are two 
 services held there every Sunday and  
 also a Sunday School. However,the     
{congregation has decreased}in number; 
 infact,by 162 members in the last 50  
 years.                                
    We have a{Community Centre}in the  
 village which is used almost every    
 night of the week. It is only 20 years
 old and the activities cater for      
 nearly all types,ranging from Karate  
 to Bingo and Darts.
