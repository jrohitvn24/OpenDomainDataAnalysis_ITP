		<title>05    MY LOCAL PAPER</title>
		<content> The name of my local paper is "Y      
 Barcud." "The Barcud" is published    
 monthly,and it costs 25p.It is all    
 written in Welsh, and this month it   
 contains 18 pages - that is September 
 1985.On the front page there is a     
 picture of our school, and all the    
 pupils.Our teachers are Mr Jones,the  
 headmaster,Mrs Rose and Mrs           
 Williams.The reason why we are on the 
 front page is because we won the Alun 
 R.Edwards shield for 1985.This shield 
 is presented annually to the primary  
 school in the county of Dyfed which   
 contributes most culturally to its    
 area and helps preserve the Welsh     
 language and customs.We help the      
 elderly,collect for the needy,and hold
 concerts.The elderly are invited into 
 school on St.David's day(March 1st)to 
 enjoy "Cawl a Chan"(traditional Welsh 
 Broth,followed by singing and reciting</content>
