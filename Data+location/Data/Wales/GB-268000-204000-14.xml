		<title>14THE LIFE OF A VICAR. cont.</title>
		<content> A vicar's job is a very difficult one.
 All the churches are in need of some  
 repair. Every Christian member of the 
 church is obliged to give a certain   
 amount of their income and this is    
 given through a weekly envelope       
 scheme. Outsiders also contribute by  
 attending the Autumn Fayre, whist     
 drives, concerts, coffee evenings and 
 so on. In 1985 the budget for the     
 Parish is Â£12,000.                    
     Each week the vicar has to write a
 sermon for the Sunday service. This   
 involves a lot of work. Most of the   
 services have Readings which are set  
 for the day so usually the theme is   
 taken from that. Sometimes someone    
 will say something to Mr. Jones and   
 that triggers off a thought for his   
 sermon.
