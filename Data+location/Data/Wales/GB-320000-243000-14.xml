		<content>  {Adam Dworski,}a lawyer from         
 Yugoslavia, came to Clyro in 1956. At 
 that time he was one of only four     
 potters in Wales.                     
   Mr. Dworski produces a distinctive  
 type of earthenware pottery using {   
{Majolica Glazes}and{Brushwork         
{Decoration.}He also makes figures,    
 plaques and pots in oxydised stoneware
 and has recently started to work in   
{porcelain.                            
    A self taught potter, he sells his 
 work direct to people visiting his    
 studio and through many shops in the  
 U.K. He also exports to Europe and    
 America.                              
     The pottery is situated at the old
 gateway of the drive to the old       
 vicarage and was originally part of   
 the stable block.{Mrs. Dworski}sells  
{painted furniture}from her studio at  
 the rear of the pottery.              </content>
