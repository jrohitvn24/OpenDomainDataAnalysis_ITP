{Wye}near{The Biblins}(5514) and became
 a{National Nature Reserve}in the      
 spring of{1984.}It is now controlled  
 by the{Nature Conservancy Council}    
 under a 99 year lease from the{       
{Forestry Commission.}                 
     The wood was last coppiced in 1906
 and since{1944}the{106 acres}have been
 completely neglected. At the same time
 a similar area of woodland nearby is  
 being tended in the normal way.       
    {Six}surveys have been carried out 
 in the last{40 years}the most recent  
 being in{1984.}Results so far have    
 revealed a smaller range and number of
 wildlife species than in the tended   
 woodland nearby. It may be as many as 
{200 years}before the resulst of the   
 experiment is really known!
