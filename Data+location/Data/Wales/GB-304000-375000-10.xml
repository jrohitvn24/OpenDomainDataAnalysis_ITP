		<title>10FARMING THE LAND (LLWYNDERW)</title>
		<content> Of the 250 acres,52 acres are to the  
 east of the village and some distance 
 away.Plas yn Cwm is the "base"farm. 25
 acres are set aside for grazing, 30   
 acres have,this year,been sown with   
 wheat and the remaining land is for   
 cutting for silage.Contractors cut the
 wheat,the straw being baled by the    
 local workforce. 2 men are employed at
 Llwynderw,a tractorman and a dairyman.
 Milking the dairy cattle begins early 
 at 4-00a.m.and takes 2 hours,in the 7-
 a-side milking parlour which has auto-
 detaching milking machines.There is a 
 further milking session which begins  
 at 2-00p.m.Prior to E.E.C.milk quotas,
 6,000 litres of milk was produced in a
 305 day period whereas now,this has   
 been reduced to 5,500 litres.         
 The soil in the valley is clay while  
 at Hendre Bach it is more sandy.
