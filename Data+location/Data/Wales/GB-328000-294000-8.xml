		<title>08The Roaring Bull of Bagbury</title>
		<content>   Under the church step at Hyssington,
 legend has it, lies the miniaturised  
 body of the Bull of Bagbury which     
 tormented the villagers of Hyssington 
 in the early 19th century.            
   An irascible{farmer}who lived at    
 Bagbury Farm was{cursed by a witch}in 
 Bishops Castle. His{soul took on the  
{form of a bull}which was eventually   
 driven into the Church and{exorcised  
 by twelve priests. The Bull shrank    
 until it could fit into a box which   
 was placed under the church step,     
 which has not been moved since.       
  {Strange markings}on the step are    
 reputed to have been caused by the    
{Bull's hooves.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
