		<title>08Farming in Caerhun Parish</title>
		<content> Hill-farming goes back generations.   
 Sons are trained in agriculture and   
 join their fathers on the farms. The  
 average farm is a smallholding        
 comprising 200 acres of mountain      
 grazing land and 30 acres of lowland  
 pasture stocked with Welsh mountain   
 sheep and Welsh cattle. Sheep's wool, 
 which is coarse, is sold for carpet   
 manufacture; lambs are ready for      
 market when they weigh approx. 35     
 kilos. The cattle are cross-bred with 
 Charolais bulls to produce lean beef  
 and the calves sold at 750 kilos.     
 Farmers grow their own crops for      
 silage and fodder. Machinery is either
 owned or rented. Sheds near farmhouses
 are for the wintering and concentrated
 feeding of sheep before lambing.      
 Farmers' wives help on the farm at    
 busy times e.g. lambing and haymaking.
