		<title>01   GENERAL REVIEW.</title>
		<content>{   The main geographical feature is   
{the confluence of the Neath and Dulais
{Rivers. The hills rise about 500 feet 
{on either side of the rivers and are  
{covered with woods and pasture land.  
{The settlement pattern is mostly      
{confined to the lower parts of the    
{valley;main villages being Aberdulais,
{Cadoxton,Cilfrew,and Tonna -also part 
{of Clyne. The open ground above is    
{taken up with a number of pastoral    
{farms. Transport is mainly road;the   
{railway is now confined to a mineral  
{line carrying coal from the Dulais    
{Valley to Aberthaw Power Station.The  
{area is no longer industrial in       
{character,the majority of people have 
{to travel for employment. Recreation  
{facilities include a Golf Club,a Wild-
{life Park,and fishing,and there has   
{recently been a drive to restore old  
{canals &amp; industrial sites for tourism.</content>
