		<title>02Dinas Powys/Wenvoe Economy</title>
		<content> This rural area, to the south-west of 
 Cardiff, features two main villages:  
 Dinas Powys (or Dinas Powis) and      
 Wenvoe.   In earlier times, limestone 
 quarrying and lime-burning were       
 important local activities.   Today,  
 though, it is an area of small farms  
 concerned mainly with dairying and    
 some beef, interspersed with tracts of
 pleasant woodland.   Market gardening 
 and horticulture are also of local    
 significance.   In addition to the two
  villages mentioned, there are also   
 smaller pleasantly-situated           
 settlements, some with interesting    
 churches of historical and            
 architectural interest.
