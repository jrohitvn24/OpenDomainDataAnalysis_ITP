		<title>11Shopping</title>
		<content> Shopping is a high priority for all   
 families.Most people(60%) make such   
 purchases everyday and for these the  
 local small shops are convenient." A  
 local shop is where I spend my pocket 
 money. Mum buys a pint of milk and    
 Gran does all her shopping because it 
 is a friendly place."                 
 Family shopping on a weekly basis     
 needs a car to travel to a favoured   
 Supermarket.Frequently this is a      
 family outing.For special occaision   
 shopping e.g. at Christmas,the nearby 
 cities of Chester and Liverpool are   
 used.                                 
 Local street markets(Thursday and     
 Sunday) are very popular. " Every     
 Sunday I go with my family to Coed    
 Mawr Market.We travel by bus.There    
 are many different stalls and the     
 stall holders shout out prices and    
 bargains and it gets quite crowded"   </content>
