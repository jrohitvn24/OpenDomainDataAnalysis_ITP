		<content> The{Inmos microchip company}was built 
 in 1982 by a man called Richard       
 Rogers. It has one of the most        
 advanced microchip production         
 facilities in the world. It produces  
 2 million chips a month with a        
 potential capacity of 5 million chips 
 a month. The Duffryn site was chosen  
 for the present development because it
 is in an attractive position, is a    
 good size and has very good motorway  
 connections.  The workers can         
 therefore have easy access.  The      
 building cost Â£11 million and was     
 partially financed by the {British    
{Technology Group}.  There are six     
 departments:- production, back end,   
 personnel, quality control and        
 facilities.  The silicon for the chips
 is imported from Japan.
