		<content>  Llangurig is situated in the         
 south-east corner of the block which  
 consists generally of hills covered   
 mainly with improved grassland, due to
{extensive draining and re-seeding     
{programmes.                           
  The village is placed in the{centre  
{of Wales}in the upper reaches of the  
{Wye Valley,}at a point where the{A470 
 joins the{A44}to{Aberystwyth.}It is   
 said to be the{highest village in     
{Wales}(about 270m above sea-level). It
 could be a good area for walkers, but 
 it is badly served with footpaths. The
 area has a{high rainfall}and a short  
 summer season. The river{fishing}is   
 poor, but the village is in easy reach
 of three good{reservoirs}-{Clywedog,  
{Elan Valley}and{Nantymoch.            
  Some{Welsh}is spoken by older        
 people,but{English}is the everyday    
 language.                             </content>
