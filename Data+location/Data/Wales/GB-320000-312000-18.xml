		<title>18A Typical Family Weekend.</title>
		<content> _Party'.My sister and her friends went
 to a party at Welshpool Town Hall.    
    Saturday was another hectic,and    
 busy day.My sister had to be in       
 Welshpool by 8.15a.m.She occasionaly  
 manages to get some part-time work in 
 a cafe.I travelled down with my siter 
 and mother.I was meeting my fellow    
 Brownies and Guides for a special fun-
 day.Luckily,it was a fine,hot         
 afternoon and everyone seemed to have 
 a pleasant day.                       
    Becouse my father is self-employed,
 and there is always plenty of work on 
 the farm,he is usually busy at the    
 weekend.When I arrived home,Garry and 
 my father had filled in the           
 foundations in our new back kitchen.  
 On Saturday evening the whole family  
 remained at home,watching T.V.        
    On Sunday morning I walked to a    
 near by Chapel for Sunday School.     </content>
