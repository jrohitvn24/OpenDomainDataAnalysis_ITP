		<title>11Family Life</title>
		<content>   Families have a stable homelife. We 
 have{virtually no unemployment,       
 divorce is uncommon. Houses are       
 privately owned and have gardens.     
 There are 18 children under 16 years. 
   Our interests are centred around    
 farming, animals, countryside and     
 activities in the Village Hall.       
  Generally, meals are wholesome- fruit
 &amp; vegetables being home grown &amp; meat  
 is locally produced.{Some farmers kill
{pigs &amp; lambs for home consumption.}We 
 eat puddings &amp; home made cakes.       
   Retired &amp; young couples have come   
 from 'other parts' to live in Hyssing-
 ton some don't adjust to village life 
 and quickly move. Our fear is rural   
 depopulation. Many cottages in the    
 Todleth area are{weekend/holiday homes
 and families aren't resident long     
 enough to become an integral part of  
 the Community.                        </content>
