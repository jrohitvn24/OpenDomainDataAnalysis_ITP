		<title>14Local history of Caerhun</title>
		<content> The area is full of the remains of    
 Pre-historic and Roman civilisations. 
 At Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen are standing      
 stones and the remains of round huts. 
 East of Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen is a stone   
 circle. To the east of Cae Coch, off  
 the track to Rowen, is a well-        
 preserved cromlech or burial chamber. 
 On the other side of the track is     
 another standing stone, Maen-y-Bardd, 
 above Rowen. A strongly-walled Iron   
 Age fort crowns the summit of         
 Pen-y-Gaer; inside are the foundations
 of twelve round huts. To the south and
 west of the fort are two areas set    
 with pointed stones to form a 'chevaux
 de frise' to deter any attackers. The 
 many tracks were originally made by   
 early man crossing from the coast at  
 Aber to the River Conwy and further   
 inland. The upland area was commonland
 until the Enclosures Act of 1832.     </content>
