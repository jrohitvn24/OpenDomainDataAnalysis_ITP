		<title>18 Employment.</title>
		<content>   One of the great concerns of people 
in the area is the high incidence of   
unemployment which is in the region of 
17%.                                   
  The town received a shattering blow a
few years ago when the main factory    
employing over 300 people closed.      
Attempts at attracting a new employer  
to take over the works sited on the    
south bank of the Wye have failed.     
  Local councillors have striven to    
attract new industries to the area,but 
still many of the young people leave   
the area to seek employment elsewhere. 
  Tourism has been suggested as a means
of coping with the problem of lack of  
employment.There is only 1 hotel in our
block and few bed and breakfast        
residences.The old Priory Street School
has been converted into a Youth Hostel 
and receives visitors from all over the
world.                                 </content>
