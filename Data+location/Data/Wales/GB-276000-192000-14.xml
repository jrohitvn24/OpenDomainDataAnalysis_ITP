		<title>14Bridges of Pontrhydyfen.</title>
		<content>     Pontrhydyfen is well known for its
 two arched bridges.The now dis-used   
 railway{viaduct}was the last railway  
 bridge to be built in the Afan Valley 
 and unlike many of the others it was  
 built of brick.It was last used in    
{1962}when the railway line was closed.
     The{aqueduct}is the most well     
 known as it is the oldest surviving   
 bridge in the valley, having been     
 built in 1825 to supply water to the  
 Blast Furnaces in Oakwood. It has 4   
 arches,is 459ft in length,75ft in     
 height and 14ft wide.The bridge cost  
 Â£16,000 pounds to build.Now it is used
 for cars and pedestrians.In February  
 1985 cracks were discovered on the    
 Aqueduct and it was closed,thus       
 cutting off a pedestrian access to    
 Oakwood. There is now scaffolding over
 the top of it. They might have to pull
 it down, who knows?              E.L. </content>
