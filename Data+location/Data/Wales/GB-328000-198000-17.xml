		<title>17PONTYPOOL HERITAGE 2</title>
		<content>   Iron works were operating in        
 Pontypool because the ore was readily 
 available in the area,coal and timber 
 were here for fuel in the smelting    
 process and a plentiful supply of     
 water.Engineers in this valley were   
 pioneers in iron then steel           
 manufacture.Our Museum has more       
 detailed history of their patents.    
   Tinplating was a development from   
 the iron_rolling industry.Black       
 lacquered tinplate ware highly        
 decorated with scenic and floral      
 pictures became known as Pontypool    
 Japan Ware.The oils and varnishes used
 to produce the highly polished finish 
 were extracted from coal.The vessels  
 had the ability to withstand heat.    
   Samples are displayed at Pontypool  
 Further Education College,our Museum, 
 and the National Museum,Cardiff.
