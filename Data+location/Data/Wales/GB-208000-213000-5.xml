 IN THE OLDEN DAYS THERE WERE TWO      
 SCHOOLS IN NARBERTH,ONE THE CHURCH    
 SCHOOL AND THE OTHER WAS AN ORDINARY  
 SCHOOL.BECAUSE NARBERTH IS IN THE     
 MIDDLE OF PEMBROKESHIRE THERE WAS A   
 STAGE COACH STOP ON THE ROAD TO       
 LONDON.THERE USED TO BE AN OLD MART   
 GROUND WHERE PEOPLE USED TO GO TO THE 
 MARKET,THEY SOLD AND BOUGHT           
 ANIMALS.NARBERTH DID NOT HAVE AS MANY 
 HOUSES AS IT HAS NOW.IT WAS A SMALL   
 VILLAGE UNTIL THEY STARTED BUILDING   
 MORE HOUSES.THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE
 LIVING IN NARBERTH UNTIL THEY PRODUCED
 MORE JOBS AND THE RAILWAY WAS BUILT.  
 THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE HERE EVEN   
 TODAY,THE POPULATION IS 1072.
