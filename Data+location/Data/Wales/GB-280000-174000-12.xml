		<title>12PORTHCAWL-Transport</title>
		<content> Great changes have occurred in        
 transport systems during the past     
 20years.There has been a major swing  
 from public to private transport.The  
 train which once brought day tourists 
 to Porthcawl by the hundred,no longer 
 runs,no traces of the line or station 
 remain.Large numbers of private cars  
 now arrive causing severe problems at 
 the end of the day as they pour out of
 the town.Coaches bring large numbers  
 of day tourists and ranks of them can 
 be seen parked near Coney Beach.The   
 number of vehicles coming into town   
 causes much congestion.Large areas of 
 what was once the harbour are now car 
 and coach parks.The volume of traffic 
 in and around the town makes it       
 difficult for tourists and residents  
 to shop and move around without       
 extreme caution in the summer months.
