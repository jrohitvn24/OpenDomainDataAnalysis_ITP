		<content> Communication has altered through the 
 years and by now most people have     
{phones}in their homes.                
 For the ones without phones there are 
{phone boxes}scattered in the country  
 but are sometimes vandalised.We have  
 tall red{phone boxes}here.In one part 
 of Cardiff they are orange and in some
 cities yellow.Our{phone box}in Cribyn 
 stands by the door of the{Post        
 Office.Many young boys have{C.B}in    
 their cars and like communicating with
 others insted of going out of the car 
 and to a phone.

 the square . It is many things,a      
 grocery,{Post Office}and even a small 
 farm.You can buy stamps and post      
 letters.Sweets,cards and china are    
 sold .Our little{Post Office}saves a
