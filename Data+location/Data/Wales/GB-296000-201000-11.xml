    The Laurels is a small nursing home
 for old people.It can only cater for  
 about 15_20 old people.The Laurels is 
 a private home so the elderly have to 
 pay to be cared for.This expense comes
 to about Â£100 a week.The nursing home 
 will not accept the elderly unless    
 they can walk up the stairs and around
 the home.                             
    Tegfan is a place for the elderly  
 which is paid for by the country.     
 Tegfan caters mostly for old people   
 who can't look after themselves.Some  
 old pensioners come to Tegfan for 1_2 
 days to be looked after,or to meet old
 friends.They can have their hair cut  
 or washed,they are bathed and fed and 
 do all sorts of different activities. </content>
