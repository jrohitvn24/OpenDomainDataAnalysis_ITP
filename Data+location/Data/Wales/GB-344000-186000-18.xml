		<title>18May Day Spectacular</title>
		<content> The May Day Spectacular was held on   
 6th may in the grounds of Caldicot    
 Castle. It was organised by members   
 of Chepstow Round Table. The proceeds 
 went to local charities.              
    At the fair there were things like 
 'the Cage', helter skelter, dodgem    
 cars and an unusual ride called       
 the American Scambler. There were many
 side shows such as dart throwing and  
 rifle shooting.                       
    In the central arena there were    
 stuntmen on motor cycles and there was
 also an aerobatic display team.       
    For Â£7.00 you could have a ride in 
 a helicopter. There were many stalls  
 manned by local organisations and     
 throughout the day the Severn Tunnel  
 Band played a medley of tunes.
