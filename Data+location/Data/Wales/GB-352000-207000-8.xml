		<content>{Newland church}is very big. A church  
 has been on this site since 1200. By  
 1400 it had reached its present size  
 with, at least, 12 priests carrying   
 out their ministries from here in     
 outlying districts.                   
{Almshouses}to the south of the church 
 were built in 1615, founded by{William
{Jones}of the{Haberdasher's Company.   
{Canon Blade,}the  warden,lives in the 
 warden's house adjoining. Cottages on 
 the north side of the churchyard used 
 to be{Bell's Foundation}almshouses.   
 Nearby, now a private house, is the   
 16th. century{Bell's School.}         
 A 100 year old{cross}in the churchyard
 was probably a village assembly point,
 marking the point where 4 paths met.  
 The{Newland Oak,}mentioned in the{    
{Domesday Book,}died a few years ago   
 and has been replaced by a young tree 
 grown from one of its own acorns.     </content>
