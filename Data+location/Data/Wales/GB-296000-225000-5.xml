		<content> An Eisteddfod is a festival of arts,  
 that is a tradition in Wales. The Urdd
 is an organisation for the young      
 people of Wales that encourages the   
 use of the Welsh language. Each year  
 the Urdd organises local Eisteddfods  
 for the young people of Wales; winners
 from the local competitions are       
 eligible to compete in the Urdd       
 National Eisteddfod, which is held    
 annually alternating between North and
 South Wales. The competitions for the 
 stage events are all in the medium of 
 Welsh_ singing, reciting, dancing and 
 playing musical intruments. There are 
 art and craft competitions and        
 sporting events. The pupils at Libanus
 C.P. School take part in the          
 eisteddfods each year and have won at 
 local and national level.
