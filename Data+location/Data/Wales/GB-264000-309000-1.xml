		<content> For the most part the general features
 of this area include large tracts of  
 moorland, heath and grassland, with   
 occasional patches of eciduous trees  
 and granite outcrops. Many of the     
 valley which permeate the site are    
 steep river valleys, and although     
 there are a few farms in the area,    
 much of the land is uninhabited except
 for the many sheep that inevitably    
 dominate the region.  As a result, the
 land tends to be rather foreboding    
 and expansive, cold and windswept.    
 And yet, it has a rugged beauty that  
 defier description, a freedom that    
 needs to be felt rather than          
 vertalised.  It is truly a splendid   
 place.
