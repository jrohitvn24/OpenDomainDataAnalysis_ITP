		<content> Hairstyles of 1985.                   
 In Cardiff today you see many young   
 people with strange hairstyles.They   
 are called Punks.Some have their hair 
 dyed black and set into sharp spikes  
 all over the head.Others have the     
 sides of their heads shaved and the   
 hair in the middle dyed red with blue 
 stripes which stick up.These are      
 called Mohicans after the American    
 Indians.Others just dye their hair    
 outrageous colours like orange,pink,  
 purple and yellow.Skinheads have all  
 their hair cut off so that they appear
 to be bald.There is another style     
 called a rat's tail which is when all 
 the hair is cut short except for a bit
 which is left long at the back.These  
 young people wear their hair in       
 strange styles to shock their parents 
 and other grown ups.Many of the young 
  people are unemployed.               </content>
