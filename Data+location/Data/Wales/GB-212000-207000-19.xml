		<content> Kaye Evans' father and Verity's mother
 work at what is now called the        
 Kilgetty Co-op.  Its real name is     
 Pricefighter but they will change the 
 name soon to Market Fresh.  Mr.       
 Phillips, the manager, said that      
 customers come from St. Clears,       
 Whitland, Tenby and Carew.  It is in a
 good central position with a large car
 park.  Sales have been maintained     
 despite the by pass.  52 full time and
 part time people work there.  They    
 receive about l00 deliveries of food  
 per week.  The takings double during  
 the summer months.  People still have 
 membership numbers and can buy shares 
 or use their stamps to buy reduced    
 foods.  It is open late on Thursday   
 and Friday nights.  It is part of a   
 large chain of Co-operative Societies.
 The turnover per year is about 3.5    
 million pounds.                       </content>
