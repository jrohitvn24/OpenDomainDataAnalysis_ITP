		<title>13FARMING (AMAETHYDDIAETH)</title>
		<content> The 7 farms in our area range from    
 600-1000 ft. They are all family farms
 working together &amp; have been passed on
 from father to son for generations. It
 is a very high rainfall area, the     
 hilly land is very steep and has been 
 ploughed &amp; seeded from old bracken to 
 fertilized pasture. The farming is of 
 sheep &amp; beef cattle. The ewes used for
 breeding are Welsh Hill Speckled Face 
 &amp; Welsh Mountain. They are crossed    
 with lowland rams for fat lamb        
 production. This year many lambs have 
 died from pneumonia. The cows are very
 important too. The Welsh black suckler
 cows are crossed with continental     
 breeds which are sold as store cattle.
 The fishing rights on the Dyfi are    
 owned by The Royal Prince Albert,     
 Macclesfield. Many large barns &amp; new  
 farm hill roads have been constructed.
