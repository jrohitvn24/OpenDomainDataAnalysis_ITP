		<content> At 7.30 A.M. I get up and get dressed.
 We have breakfast at 8.00. I usually  
 have cereal for breakfast and lemon   
 juice which is very sour. After that I
 have a wash, brush my hair, and put on
 my coat. By this time it's usually    
 8.25 A.M. The taxi comes at 8.30 A.M. 
 It's only a quick drive up to school  
 so we have about 25 mins playtime.At  
 9.00 A.M. we go into school. We have  
 to read for half an hour. At 9.30 we  
 have assembly. We sing and listen to a
 story. Mr Williams ( our headmaster)  
 sometimes talks to us . Or if there is
 a new child Mr Williams introduces us 
 in assembly.After that,we come back   
 into the classroom and do maths.I'm on
 Beta 4.At 10.40 A.M. we have a break .
 We have have a drink of milk and go   
 outside.At 11.00 A.M. we come into the
 classroom and do Welsh and English.At
