  A{Public Enquiry}was held into the   
 scheme of the Gwalia Housing          
 Association,of Swansea,to build an    
 estate of houses on the site of the   
 old{Glyncollen House.                 
  The{Ynysforgan Residents'}Association
 was successful in its appeal against  
 the building of flats which would have
 overlooked many small bungalows in the
 area.                                 
   The Welsh Office Inspector,Mr.Donald
 Lindsey said that the threatened fine 
 copper beech specimens should be      
 preserved at all costs.The nearby     
 Motorway would also create noise in   
 excess of the 68 decibel level.       
   In June 1985 the area was made into 
 a play area.A tree planting ceremony  
 was attended by Glyncollen children   
 and by Cllrs Moriarty and Adams.
