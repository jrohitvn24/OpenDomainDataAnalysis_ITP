		<content> There are few local customs but the   
 people of the village are always ready
 and willing to take part in anything  
 to raise money for a good cause. There
 are two traditional events that are   
 held annually they are the Boat Race  
 and the Carnival.                     
{THE BOAT RACE                         
  This event is organised by the rugby 
 club and takes place every Boxing Day 
 morning. The competitors dress in     
 fancy-dress and run in the river from 
 one bridge to another and back, a     
 distance of 300 meters. A collection  
 is made and the money given to        
 charity.                              
{THE CARNIVAL                          
  This event takes place in the summer.
 It gives the village a chance to 'Let 
 it's hair down'.
