		<content>      I  live on one of the housing    
 estates in our area it is called THE  
 RISE. Lots of people come to our      
 estate the postman,the milkman and    
 corona man.The estate is about 4 or 5 
 years old and still has not been      
 finished there are lots of pieces of  
 land you can buy to build on.Some of  
 these plots have good views and you   
 can see Trearddur Bay beach.Sometimes 
 we see people having  picnics on the  
 grass at the far end of our           
 estates.There is a road going down -  
 you go over 2 stites , walk across a  
 pipe and your on a beach.On the estate
 there is a big board saying what the  
 houses are called , our house is      
 called Dinam.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
