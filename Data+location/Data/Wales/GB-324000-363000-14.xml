		<title>14      Social Concerns</title>
		<content> On the questionnaire sent out to the  
 Buckley sample, the parents were given
 an opportunity to state what, in their
 opinion, should be done to improve the
 town. The replies were indicative of  
 concern about a variety of            
 improvements which they felt would    
 prove most beneficial to the          
 community. 38 wanted better recreation
 facilities for the young. 32 felt that
 improved shopping facilities,         
 especially large department stores,   
 would be highly desirable. 25 would   
 like to see the provision of parks and
 gardens, and many felt that the large 
 areas of common land would lend       
 themselves admirably for this purpose.
 23 were anxious to have the town      
 'cleaned up', and there are a number  
 of 'eyesores'. 13 wanted better town  
 planning and 12 improved roads. 10    
 wanted better policing.               </content>
