		<title>02TRANSPORT TRAFFIC NORTHOP</title>
		<content> A useful exercise in any village is to
 determine the weight of traffic. At   
 the present time Clwyd is busy        
 constructing new roads and Northop is 
 being considered for a new bye-pass.  
 We thought that it would be           
 interesting to carry out a survey of  
 traffic to see just how busy Northop  
 is.On July 8th six pupils from Argoed 
 High School carried out two traffic   
 counts of thirty minutes. Each pupil  
 was given one road to cover and the   
 following were counted:- cars, large  
 vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.   
 Here are the results:-                
           Count 1   Count 2    TOTAL
