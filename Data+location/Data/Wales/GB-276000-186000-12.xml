		<content>      Several main bus routes pas      
 through our area. One of these        
 routes run from Margam to the bus     
 station in town centre .The other     
 route runs from the station to        
 Porthcawl. Besides these the town is  
 one of the major stops on the National
 inter city route.                     
      Also just outside our area we    
 have a Railway station in town,which  
 is part of the main line service of   
 the Swansea to London route which     
 serves most of South Wales.           
      Most people in our area own a car
 or have access to the public transport
 systems. Many people get together and 
 hire a mini bus or a taxi to get back 
 and forth from work.Also many children
 hire a mini bus to get back and forth 
 from school.
