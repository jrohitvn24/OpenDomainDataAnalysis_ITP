 comprehensive and further education   
 schools.We also cover centres for slow

 Lane Open Air School.                 
    Nursery education is found in      
 Cwmdare and Comin.They take children  
 from 5_11 years of age and teach them 
 a variety of subjects.                
    Comprehensive education  is found  
 in the Girls'Comprehensive,Boys'      
 Comprehensive and St.John the Baptist.
 Children go to these schools from     
 11_18 years of age.It is in these     
 schools that many children take their 
 O and A levels to go onto further     
 education.                            
    At the bottom of Cwmdare hill there
 is a college of Further education     
 where students go from school to gain 
 diplomas and certificates.            </content>
