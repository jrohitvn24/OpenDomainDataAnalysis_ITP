		<content> Without a doubt the main coverage of  
 local affairs and events is to be     
 found in the "Leader".  For the area  
 of Aberaman, Godreaman, Cwmaman and   
 Abercwmboi the Aberdare Leader is     
 produced but for the area of Glenboi  
 the "Mountain Ash Leader" is produced.
 The "Leader" was first printed in 1901
 and within the Cynon Valley it has    
 high readership figures; but,         
 unfortunately in the past several     
 years these figures have fallen       
 slightly, this is most probably due to
 the increase in the number of video   
 recorders.  The area has not had any  
 books written on it in recent years.  
   One great literary figure to come   
 from Cwmaman was the poet Alun Lewis. 
 He was one of this century's renowned 
 poets but he unfortunately died during
 the Second World War.
