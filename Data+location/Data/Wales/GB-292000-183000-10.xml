		<title>10Rieondel Cattery.</title>
		<content> Mr. Raymond Sealy's interest in       
 breeding cats encouraged him to open a
 cattery. Cats are boarded there whilst
 their owners are away from home.      
 During the high season as many as 18  
 cats are catered for at the cattery.  
  The name {Rieondel}is made up from   
 the names of Mr.Sealy and his wife    
 Marie Elizabeth.                      
  The cattery is clean,caring and      
 safe,with ample facilities for the    
 cats. It also has proper facilities   
 for breeding cats.                    
  Mr. Sealy has three cats of his own, 
 a male stud cat and two females. He   
 regularly 'shows' his cats and their  
 show names all start with {RIEON.}
