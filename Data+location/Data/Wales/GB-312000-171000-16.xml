		<content> the site of Cwrt_yr_ala.In the late   
 eighteenth century Cwrt_yr_ala was    
 owned by the Rous family and in 1820  
 Thomas Bates Rous erected a mansion   
 house on the site of the old          
 house.Described as an "Italian villa" 
 it lasted until 1940 when Sir Herbert 
 Merrett, a coal magnate, demolished it
 and built instead a substantial       
 country house, possibly the last of   
 its type to be built in Wales.The new 
 house was designed by Sir Percy Thomas
 in the late Georgian style and is     
 occupied today by a Cardiff solicitor,
 Mr. Layton Lougher.This property is   
 currently on the market.
