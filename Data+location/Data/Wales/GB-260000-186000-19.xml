		<title>19Oystermouth - Old Mumbles</title>
		<content>   Mumbles is not really a village     
 nor is it a town but a group of small 
 communities huddled together on the   
 West side of Swansea Bay. At the      
 centre of the group which includes    
 Norton, Newton, Langland and          
 Thistleboon is Oystermouth which grew 
 up around the Norman Castle.          
   The first Castle was built by the de
 Breos family at the end of the 12th   
 Century. It was made of wood but this 
 was not secure enough when attacked by
 the native Welsh, so the present stone
 one was built.                        
   In the last century Mumbles was a   
 fishing village and on the beach there
 were farms where oysters were grown.  
 It was, and still is such a beautiful 
 place                                 
 that people travel many miles to come 
 and see it.
