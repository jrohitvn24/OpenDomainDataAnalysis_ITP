 THE POPULATION IS SMALL,- SOME 230    
 ADULTS AND 75 CHILDREN(18-).          
 THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF PENSIONERS  
 MAINLY BECAUSE THEY FIRST CAME TO     
 SETTLE IN THE VILLAGE AS YOUNG PEOPLE 
 TO WORK IN THE DEPOT.                 
 THE BIRTH RATE HAS ALSO BEEN LOW,     
 ALTHOUGH TWO FAMILIES EACH HAVE SEVEN 
 CHILDREN. THIS IS MUCH THE EXCEPTION, 
 WITH TWO CHILDREN AS THE USUAL.       
 ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT MANY OF THE    
 YOUNGER FAMILIES HAVE OPTED TO BUY    
 THEIR OWN HOMES, THIS NECESSITATING   
 LEAVING THE VILLAGE SINCE NO PRIVATE  
 HOUSING IS EITHER FOR SALE OR CAN BE  
 BUILT.                                
 THE POSSIBILITY THE BARHAM ROAD AND   
 HILL ROAD WILL BE DEMOLISHED HAS ALSO 
 ACCELERATED DEPARTURE AND HINDERED    
 INCOMING.                             </content>
