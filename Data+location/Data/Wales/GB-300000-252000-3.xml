		<title>03ACIDIFICATION OF THE RIVERS</title>
		<content> In this section of the Wye the quality
 of the trout fishing has declined over
 the last two decades and the numbers  
 of grayling and chub have increased.  
 This might be due in part to the      
 acidification of the rivers in recent 
 times. The acidity of the nearby River
 Irfon has changed from pH7 (near      
 neutral) in 1963 to about pH4.7 (near 
 the acidity of vinegar) today. The    
 problems of acidity are not as bad    
 where there is lime in the water to   
 neutralise it. Crayfish require lime  
 for their shells, so are indicators of
 lime, (calcium), in the water.        
 Crayfish are not found in any streams 
 further upstream on the Wye than the  
 Dulas at Cwmbach. In many parts of    
 Britain "crayfish plague" a fungal    
 disease has killed the Briish crayfish
 but not in this area yet, fortunately.
