		<content> Our area of study is in the{Western   
{Valley of Gwent},which is part of the 
{South Wales Coalfield.                
 The land of this area is that of      
 mountains separated by valleys.The    
 valleys have steep sides and are      
 heavily forested both with natural    
 beech and oak woods and with man_made 
 coniferous forest.What flat land there
 is is heavily used chiefly for        
 building.                             
 The area is both rural and urban,with 
 part of{Abertillery}town in the       
 southern section.Abertillery had a    
 population of 30,000 in the early     
 fifties but this has declined to      
 14,000 with an unemployment figure of 
 18% to 20%,mainly due to the closure  
 of four collieries and associated     
 heavy industries.{
