		<title>13LOCAL HISTORY CORN MILL</title>
		<content> The old corn mill was built around    
 1685 and was used for grinding corn.It
 was powered by water from the stream  
 called Cwmshenkin.The water wheel     
 drives the cogs round which drives the
 grindstones to grind the corn.Grain   
 was used to feed animals and make     
 bread.The farmers brought it to be    
 ground at the mill.Mr. Cuthbert Jones 
 the owner did not live in the mill,he 
 lived at Govilon House.The workers    
 lived at the cottages near the        
 mill.The cogs inside the mill were    
 made out of wood and the main building
 was made from Welsh stone.The mill    
 wheel does not work any more and the  
 outside of it is not original,but the 
 inside is.The work was completed in   
 1978 and the present owners are Mr.   
 and Mrs. Booth.
