		<content> Besides the permanent shops we have a 
 market in the area.                   
 This market is held on Thursday and   
 Saturday each week.The market is      
 situated in{Church Street,}the main   
 shopping street of{Abertillery.}      
                                       
 The market is of a general kind with  
 produce,clothing,household and        
 domestic goods predominating.Many of  
 the stallholders travel around the    
 markets{Gwent}on a regular route:_    
{Abergavenny Tuesdays,Pontypridd       
{Wednesdays and Abertillery Thursdays. 
                                       
 The market attracts people from the   
 whole of the Abertillery district and 
 the surrounding area.This is a welcome
 boost to the local shops usual trade  
 but does cause some traders concern if
 they have a specialist commodity that 
 is in competition with a market stall.</content>
