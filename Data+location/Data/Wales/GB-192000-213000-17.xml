		<title>17Haverfordwest in Pembs.</title>
		<content> Until local government reorganization 
 Haverfordwest was the County Town of  
 Pembrokeshire. Many local people      
 regret the loss of status for the town
 and, as they see it, a remoteness of  
 local politics. There is a movement   
 "Bring back Pembrokeshire" which is   
 campaigning, and has met with some    
 success---the Post Office now accepts 
 Pembrokeshire as an address.          
    There is, however, an area         
 administration office within the new  
 county of Dyfed with an Area Education
 Officer. The Ministry of Agriculture  
 maintains a local office and the Water
 Authority has built a new area        
 administrative centre, but the main   
 Post Office and Electricity Board's   
 offices have been moved away.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
