		<content> There is a mixture of farms and small 
 holdings within the block but the     
 majority  of them are too small to    
 provide work except for the farmer,   
 his wife and family. In some instances
 the farmer is also in full time       
 occupation and only runs the farm with
 the help of his family during his     
 leisure time.                         
   Mixed Farming is the main form of   
 Agriculture. Most of the open land    
 near the River Gwendraeth and to the  
 South West of Tumble is used for      
 grazing, the soil is unsuitable for   
 growing crops being to wet and of poor
 quality. The land has also been       
 extensively worked for coal by means  
 of Opencast Mining. On top of the     
 ridge to the South and South East of  
 Tumble the land is very boggy, marshy 
 and heavy and most of it is unsuitable
 even for grazing.                     </content>
