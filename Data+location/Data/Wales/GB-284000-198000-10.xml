		<content> Glyncorrwg is a dead-end and the only 
 form of transport is road. There is   
 only one road into the viilage.There  
 is a regular bus service to the towns 
 and a bus leaves the village every    
 hour. There is a limited service on   
 Sundays. This however is due to change
 with the buses leaving ever two hours 
 and no service on Sundays. There are  
 private services for people travelling
 to work; the colliers have their own  
 transport and workers in the Borg     
 Warner Plant have their own transport.
 The N.C.B. supply transport free but  
 the Borg Warner transport is paid for 
 by the workers. The majority of the   
 working population have cars which are
 necessary for them to go to work.
