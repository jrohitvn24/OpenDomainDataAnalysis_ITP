		<title>07RICHARD WILLIAMS JNR.CHOIR</title>
		<content> The {Richard Williiams Choir}are aged 
 from just 7 up to 16.The 40 girls and 
 boys come from in and around          
 Tonyrefail.Many of them are brothers, 
 sisters and cousins.Every Tuesday and 
 Thursday from 5 pm up until 7.30pm we 
 hold rehearsals. We rehearse in a     
 large room next to Mr.Williams's      
 house.He is very strict and does not  
 allow us to talk because he wants us  
 to sing perfectly.                    
   We have been to many different      
 countries such as{Czechoslovakia,     
{Canada, Germany, France and Russia.}  
 Next year we are going to{Switzeland  
 and we are now learning some German   
 songs.When we go to other countries we
 do not stay in hotels but stay in     
 peoples homes.When visiting choirs    
 come to Tonyrefail they stay in our   
 homes.We like the choir because we    
 learn new songs and meet new friends. </content>
