		<content> We interviewed two people who are part
 of our local community.Mrs.Bowen,the  
 district nurse and health visitor,told
 us that in her job she cared for      
 people from their birth until their   
 death.She said that she had delivered 
 over 400 babies.she visited them and  
 their mothers to make sure they were  
 both healthy.She told us that there   
 were many old people living in the    
 area because people lived much longer 
 these days.She visited old people     
 every day.P.C. Price told us the      
 discipline of his job and we were     
 surprised to learn that he could not  
 even roll up his sleeves without      
 permission from the chief constable.He
 showed us his radio,note book,        
 handcuffs and his truncheon.He        
 explained how and when he used them.It
 was his aim to get to know all the    
 local children.           {Talycopa}  </content>
