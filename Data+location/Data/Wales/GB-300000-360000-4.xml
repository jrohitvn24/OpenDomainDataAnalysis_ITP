		<title>04THE SMITHY AT NANTGLYN.</title>
		<content>    The building to show local history 
 is the 200 year old blacksmiths forge,
 now used as a craftshop. Originally   
 the blacksmiths would shoe horses and 
 cattle before their long journey to be
 sold in England.                      
    The leatherworker,a Californian,   
 has kept the artefacts from the old   
 smithy, such as saddles, horseshoes,  
 blinkers, shears and animal traps. He 
 has a large single bellows, 150 years 
 old which still works. A hundred year 
 old bellows is used to light his wood 
 burning stove.The old ranges and      
 suspended chimney hoods are still in  
 good condition, so is the slate       
 flagged floor.                        
    The best quality leather bags are  
 sold for Â£48, and purses bracelets    
 and keyrings are around Â£1.Nantglyn   
 is off the main tourist routes so most
 of the crafts are sold elsewhere.     </content>
