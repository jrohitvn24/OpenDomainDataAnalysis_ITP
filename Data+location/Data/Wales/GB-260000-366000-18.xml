          A YOUNG MAN                  
         ___________                   
 We asked a young man what he thought  
 of our area and this was his reply.   
  "There is a great deal of            
 unemployment in the area and finding a
 job is very difficult.I will probably 
 have to move away to a bigger city to 
 have any hope of a job.There is hardly
 anything to do during the evenings    
 other than the youth club during the  
 Winter months.We could do with a sport
 centre in the area because the nearest
 is 5 miles away in Bangor and to catch
 a bus every time is expensive.I would 
 like to see the youth club open       
 throughout the year so that young     
 people can have somewhere to go.We    
 seem to be ten years behind the time  
 here."
