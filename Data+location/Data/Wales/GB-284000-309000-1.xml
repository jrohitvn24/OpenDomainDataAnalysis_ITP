		<content> Persuing one of his hobbies Mr Will   
 Breese has made,on a rough piece of   
 ground,near his house an interesting  
 small industrial museum. Pieces of    
 machinery used in the past in         
 surrounding quarries &amp; on the old     
 tramline through the village are      
 carefully painted, arranged &amp; labelled
 Old photographs of villagers, many now
 dead, engaged in their daily work are 
 displayed in glass frames and a       
 fascinating model of a working quarry 
 is one of the highlights of the scene.
 Summer visitors may often be seen     
 admiring the exhibits. No charge is   
 made but donations may be given to a  
 Railway charity for the blind. Mr     
 Breese now retired from his job as    
 railway signalman is the right man to 
 consult about Aberangell in the past.
