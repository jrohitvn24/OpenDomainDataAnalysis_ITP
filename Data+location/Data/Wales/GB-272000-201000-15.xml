 Holidays are public holidays when the 
 majority of people do not work.       
    On March 1st. in Wales schools     
 celebrate St. David's Day with a half 
 day's holiday and concert during which
 children sing, dance and recite in    
 Welsh and English.  The girls dress in
 Welsh costume - checked woollen skirt,
 betgwm shawl, blouse and a tall black 
 hat.  Most people wear a leek or      
 daffodil.                             
    A 'duck' race is held to raise     
 money for the Folk Festival.  People  
 pay for numbered plastic ducks which  
 are raced down the River Tawe.  The   
 Folk Festival is held in August.      
 People attend from different parts of 
 the world for a weekend of folk music 
 and dance.  There is a parade of      
 dancers and bands through the village 
 of Pontardawe and also a craft market.</content>
