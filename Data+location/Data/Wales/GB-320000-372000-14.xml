		<title>14GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> This block contains a part of the town
 of Flint known as Cornist. Cornist    
 consists of a series of housing       
 estates which have been built during  
 the past 15 years. There are few shops
 or amenities, some of the houses are  
 private and a large minority are      
 corporation houses.                   
 Flint Industrial Estate lies between  
 Cornist and the River Dee. The Estate 
 is fairly new and for the most part   
 consists of small factory units. There
 is one large factory, Kimberley Clark,
 but this is highly mechanized and     
 employs few local people. Some of the 
 factory units were built on the site  
 of the demolished textile mills.      
 Much of the rest of the block is      
 sparsely populated mixed farmland.    
 Part of the small village of Bagillt  
 is in the block, this is mostly       
 housing estates.                      </content>
