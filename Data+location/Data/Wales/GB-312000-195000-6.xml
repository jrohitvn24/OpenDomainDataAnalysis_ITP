		<content> The two industrial areas in the region
 are at Tir-y-berth and the Penallta   
 Industrial Estate.                    
        These have been developed to   
 bring employment to the region where  
 coal mining is being phased out.      
        The Tir-y-berth industrial area
 has the Norgine factory which makes   
 pharmaceutical products.The company   
 employs eighty people.Most of the     
 workers are local people,but the      
 managers and scientists come from     
 other areas.The head office is in     
 Oxford.The firm has been in           
 Tir-y-berth for sixteen years,since   
 January 1969.The original product was 
 produced in Prague in Czechoslovakia. 
 The name Norgine is derived from the  
 word Norway and the"gine"from algenic 
 acid obtained from seaweed which was  
 brought in sailing boats from Norway  
 and then transported to Prague.       </content>
