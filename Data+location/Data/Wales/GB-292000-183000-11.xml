		<title>11The Mayor.</title>
		<content>  Councillor Embling represents this   
 community on the Ogwr Borough Council 
 and this year he has been our Mayor.  
  He was born in Heol-y-Cyw and was a  
 pupil at this school from 1929 to     
 1935. At 14 years of age he left      
 school to train as a bricklayer. Four 
 years later he became a miner and     
 began to take an interest in community
 activities. He has been very active in
 all aspects of community life and for 
 the last 10 years he has served as our
 Councillor.                           
  He is the Vice-Chairman of the School
 Governors and has been very active in 
 the life of the school. His knowledge 
 of the area has been very helpful to  
 us in our research for this project.
