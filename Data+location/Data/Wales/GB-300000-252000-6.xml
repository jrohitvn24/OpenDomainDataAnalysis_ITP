		<title>06THE ANIMALS OF MID-WALES</title>
		<content> The most typical "Welsh" animal in the
 district is the polecat which, just   
 after the 2nd. World War, was more or 
 less restricted to Cardiganshire but  
 is now reported as far east as the    
 outskirts of Birmingham. The otter is 
 a distant relative of the polecat and 
 its stronghold in England and Wales is
 now the upper Wye and upper Severn    
 catchments. It is therefore pleasing  
 to note that it has bred within the   
 last few years on this part of the    
 Wye. Foxes are plentiful and kept in  
 check by hunting which probably kills 
 half the population each year. Badgers
 on the other hand are protected by law
 and found in several local woodlands. 
 There has been concern that they may  
 be carriers of bovine tuberculosis,   
 but no badgers in Powys have been     
 found to be infected. There are bats  
 in Cwmbach Church.                    </content>
