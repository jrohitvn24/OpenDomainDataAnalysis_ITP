 The land is put to  either            
 agricultural or commercial use.The    
 higher land is generally to the North 
 West and North East, away from the    
 river and its swampy meadows and      
 streamlets                            
                                       
 To the South West crops are planted   
 and are well cultivated.  The         
 buildings are well scattered apart    
 from the industrial complex and the   
 housing estate.  Many old dwellings   
 Chapels etc have been converted into  
 dwelling places.  Farm houses and     
 cottages are mainly brick pre 1900    
 buildings and the hosing estate and   
 factories are architect designed post 
 war buildings.  The sewage works has  
 its own specialised buildings.
