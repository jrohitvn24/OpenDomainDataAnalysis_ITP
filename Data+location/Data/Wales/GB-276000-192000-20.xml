		<content> Ponrhydyfen is{liked}because it is a  
{quiet village with helpful and        
{friendly people full of a community   
{spirit and nestling in picturesque    
{surroundings within easy reach of     
{surrounding towns. }Many of the senior
 citizens also stated that they were   
 born in the village and would not     
 dream of leaving the village          
 atmosphere.                           
   An interesting point was that 8     
 households found the bus services     
 convenient whilst another 5 found them
 infrequent.                           
                                       
   Children also felt that there should
 be more places for them to go and more
 things to do. They wanted more        
 equipment in the parks, more shops and
 a cafe. The majority felt that it was 
 still a very nice place to live.
