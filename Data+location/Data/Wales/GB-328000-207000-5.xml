		<content> My dad usually gets up at half past   
 five,he is very busy on the farm and  
 has a contracting bussiness to run.We 
 get up later,between seven and half   
 past,and the school mini bus picks us 
 up at half past eight.We get to school
 about twenty to nine,but sometimes it 
 varies.While we are at school my mum  
 washes up the breakfast things,and dad
 comes in to have a cup of coffee and a
 biscuit.It is usually at that time    
 when the phone begins to ring,it is   
 probably for my dad so he answers.This
 time of year it is usually forage     
 harvesting,but if it is for my mum he 
 will fetch her,and he will go and     
 finish his coffee.After they have had 
 their coffee mum will clean the house 
 or go out shopping,and my dad will go 
 out to work,or if it is a market day  
 he will go to Abergavenny market,and  
 may sell some sheep or cows.          </content>
