		<content> There is a children's playground and  
 recreation field next to the village  
 hall.A children's club for under 12's 
 meets once weekly in the hall,also a  
 mother and toddlers group.Occasionally
 a disco is held for young teenagers.  
 A few boys play cricket with the men's
 team and some girls attend ladies keep
 fit.The boy's football team disbanded 
 because there was no home pitch.      
 Children have to be transported to    
 Pontypool,Usk or Goytre by parents for
 organisations and activities such as  
 Scouts/Cubs, Guides/Brownies, Air     
 Training Corps.,Army Cadets, swimming,
 ballet,Kung_Fu,gymnastics,tennis,etc. 
 The Village Hall Committee are now    
 hoping to build on a room for         
 youngsters to use for sporting        
 activities etc.but it has yet to be   
 decided if this is economically       
 viable.                               </content>
