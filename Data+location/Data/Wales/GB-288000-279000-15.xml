		<content>  Three main historical features of the
 village are the{church, the fountain  
{and the cenotaph.                     
{ Saint Curig's Church}has been        
 renovated in 1984/85. It has been     
 re-roofed, the spire re-clad in copper
 and the tower re-pointed. The church  
 was founded by Saint Curig who died in
 A.D.550. The present church dates     
 from the 15th century. The tower was  
 built in 1330. The lychgate was       
 erected in 1740.                      
  The{fountain}was a gift of a water   
 supply to the village by George Hope  
 Lloyd Verney in 1888. He was a local  
 benefactor.                           
  The{cenotaph}is sited at the junction
 of the main road and the Clochfaen    
 road. There are plans to re-locate it 
 by the church.
