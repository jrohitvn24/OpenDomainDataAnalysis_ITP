		<title>05SULLY ISLAND</title>
		<content> Sully Island is in Swanbridge         
 Bay,in the Bristol Channel.It         
 is a small island and on rough        
 days the tide washes over the         
 top.                                  
    Sully Island has an Iron Age fort  
 occupying the eastern end of the      
 island, on the summit of which is a   
 bronze age barrow.                    
    Sully Island is about 500 metres   
 from the mainland, Swanbridge. It is  
 joined by a causeway.                 
    When the tide is out people can    
 walk across to the island, but when   
 the tide is in you can't cross. The   
 current is very strong and many people
 have been trapped on the island.      
    On the island there is a lot of    
 grass and bushes, but on the other    
 side there are lots of caves and      
 rocks.                                
                                       </content>
