		<content> On a survey of the area we found that 
 most of the housing was of an older   
 design.  Some of the smaller cottages 
 being approximately{120 years old}and 
 built by mine owners etc. for their   
 imported workforce.                   
 Today there is also a large number of{
{Council Houses}in the area, with only 
 very few transfered to private        
 ownership.                            
 The vast majority of houses were built
 of stone taken from local quarries    
 (there is an old,{diused stone quarry 
 in the north east corner of the survey
 block).                               
 As work began on council homes the    
 emphasis changed from stone to brick  
 work as bricks were readily available 
 from a local brickworks.              
 Very few modern private houses have   
 been built within the block.
