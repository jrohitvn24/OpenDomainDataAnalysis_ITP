		<content>  All of the churches in the survey    
 area have an ageing membership with   
 most congregations having over 50's   
 as the majority. Bethlehem, in        
 Cefnybedd has a Sunday School with 25 
 youngsters attending.                 
  Most churches have memberships of    
 less than fifty and all are faced with
 financial problems because the income 
 from membership does not cover        
 expenditure. Apart from contributing  
 to the minister's wage, the biggest   
 problems arise from heating and       
 maintenance costs.                    
 Mr.John Meirion Evans, a deacon at    
 Bethlehem church,Cefnybedd, reports   
 that members do what is possible to   
 maintain the church, but that some    
 jobs have to be contracted out. His   
 church,like others, holds regular     
 fund-raising events to help meet      
 costs.                                </content>
