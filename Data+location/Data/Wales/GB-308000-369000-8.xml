		<content> The hobbies and pastimes of the       
 children in school are many and       
 varied.They include sporting interests
 such as football, rugby and swimming. 
 Many children belong to Denbigh       
 Swimming Club.                        
       Music plays an important part in
 many children's pastimes.Recorder     
 lessons are given at school, and      
 children receive private tuition in   
 cello, piano, cornet,clarinet and     
 guitar.Some children are considering  
 joining the recently formed Denbigh   
 Schools Orchestra.                    
       Since this is a rural area the  
 pastimes of horseriding,sailing,      
 shooting and fishing are very         
 popular.Some of the above events are  
 combined to form the popular event of 
 tetrathlon.
