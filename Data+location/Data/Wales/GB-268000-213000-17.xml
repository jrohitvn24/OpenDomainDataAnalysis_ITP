		<content>  Trade in our area is limited to small
 shops privately owned.  On our survey 
 of buildings in the area there was a  
 large numbered of shops which had     
 ceased trading; many of these being   
 converted into private dwellings.     
 Most consumer goods are available at  
 these local shops though prices are a 
 great deal cheaper at the neighbouring
 towns.                                
 Trade for these local firms is boosted
 by the difficulty in travelling to    
 neighbouring towns and returning with 
 large amounts of shopping.            
 There is no doubt that local traders  
 would suffer if transport to these    
 towns was more frequent.
