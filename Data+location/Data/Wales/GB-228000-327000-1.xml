		<title>01MYNYDD RHIW AND LOW LAND</title>
		<content> This area is dominated by Rhiw        
 mountain rising to three hundred and  
 five metres. The vantage point        
 overlooking the Lleyn peninsula and   
 out to Barsley Island, is the site of 
 a radar station and a radio mast. The 
 village of Rhiw has only a post       
 office but in the past has had a      
 shop, garage, pub and a mine on the   
 mountain. The welsh community is mixed
 with some {English}people and many of 
 the local homes are empty for most of 
 the year, being only used as holiday  
 homes. Farming is the only local      
 industry supporting dairy and beef    
 cattle, and sheep.
