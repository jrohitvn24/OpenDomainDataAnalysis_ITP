		<title>19A Famous Naturalist</title>
		<content> Mr. John Barrett, OBE, is a famous    
 naturalist who lives in Dale. He      
 learned about nature first as a boy at
 school and then during his time in the
 RAF. When he was a POW in Germany, he 
 continued to study birds. After the   
 war he became Warden of Dale Fort     
 Field Centre, wrote books and made    
 broadcasts. As members of the public  
 came repeatedly to consult him, he    
 inaugurated a series of walks and     
 talks on the local flora, fauna,      
 geology and history. He has been      
 called the "Pied Piper of Dale". He   
 believes that nature will find its own
 balance provided that man does not    
 upset things by pollution and killing.
 We, the children of Dale School who   
 have worked on this survey, agree with
 him.
