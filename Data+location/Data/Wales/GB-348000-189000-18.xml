		<title>18FARMING NEAR CHEPSTOW.</title>
		<content>   Much of our area is used for        
 agricultural purposes so we asked some
 of the local farmers what advantages  
 there were in farming in this part of 
 Wales.                                
                                       
   The farmers said that the very      
 fertile soil in the Chepstow area     
 allowed great versatility for most    
 types of arable farming and stock     
 rearing.  Also, there is very good    
 access to markets, and the motorway   
 system aids communications and        
 deliveries.                           
                                       
   Split-site farming was one of the   
 disadvantages in this area and,       
 although nearby urbanisation provided 
 employees, tresspassers, vandals and  
 motor-cyclists caused problems because
 they have little knowledge of country 
 side behaviour.                       </content>
