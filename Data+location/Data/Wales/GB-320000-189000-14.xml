		<content>  Following the recent revival of      
 interest in the Welsh language, the   
 influence of the Welsh Nationalist    
 Party{Plaid Cymru}has increased, at   
 Local Government level at least.      
 However, the area is still very much a
{Labour}controlled one, despite the    
 closeness of the recent Wattsville by-
 election. In this,{Plaid Cymru}came   
 within 200 or so votes of{Labour}who  
 retained the seat.                    
  The M.P. for Islwyn Constituency is  
 Neil Kinnock, leader of the{Labour}   
 party. He visits the constituency     
 often and on 21st June 1985 he        
 launched the "Scitech" Open Tech      
 project at Crosskeys College. The     
 influence of the{S.D.P.}is minimal    
 (only one member on Islwyn Borough    
 Council) and the{Tory Party}is        
 virtually non-existent.
