		<content> The things I like about{Bethlehem}are 
 that I can keep a pony and it is not  
 very far from my home.In the summer we
 can walk to the river to swim in about
 twenty minutes.We can also ride our   
 bikes to the river because there is   
 not a lot of traffic on the roads.    
 Another good thing is we don't have   
 people living right next door to us,  
 and there are not many people in the  
 village so I know just about everybody
 here.We are also very lucky because   
 the air is always clean and fresh for 
 there are no{factories}or any other   
 fumes to pollute the atmosphere.The   
 things I don't like about{Bethlehem   
 are there are no shops in the village,
 if you forget o'r run out of something
 .The other thing I dislike is that we 
 do not have any buses exept once a    
 week.
