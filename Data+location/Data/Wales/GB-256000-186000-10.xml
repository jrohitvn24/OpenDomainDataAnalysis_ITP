		<title>10THE STANDARD OF LIVING</title>
		<content>   I am fifteen years old. I have to go
 to school by law and my parents are   
 totally in charge of me. At this point
 in time 3 million people are on the   
 dole and 4 million are unemployed. And
 so most people of my age are facing   
 unemployment unless something drastic 
 is done. These days the latest craze  
 is drugs and although it is illegal it
 is very easy to get hold of them and  
 at this time it seems to me that the  
 police aren't doing much.             
   The standard of living in the       
 Western world is improving all the    
 time, with advances in medical fronts 
 all the time. However in the eastern  
 world the living standard is bad.
