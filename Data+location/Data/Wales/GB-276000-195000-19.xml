		<title>19THE GNOLL PARK, NEATH</title>
		<content> The Gnoll Park is a popular           
 recreational area for the inhabitants 
 of Neath town . The local authority is
 responsible for the maintenance of the
 park, woodland and ponds contained    
 within the grounds. There is an       
 obstacle course, children's play area 
 with swings, roundabout and slides,a  
 pitch and putt golf course, four ponds
 and several woodland walks. The       
 largest pond is used for coarse       
 fishing and is stocked with perch,    
 rudd, tench and carp. A special       
 licence is required to fish here but  
 this is not expensive or difficult to 
 obtain. This pond is also stocked with
 a small number of exotic wildfowl     
 including a black swan. The park is   
 often used by people walking their    
 dogs and by joggers keeping fit. Many 
 wild birds breed in the park. There   
 are several exotic trees,e.g.redwoods.</content>
