		<title>05TONMAWR - EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Although all the collieries in the    
 immediate vicinity of the village have
 closed, mining is still a major source
 of employment in Tonmawr.. both       
 National Coal Board pits and          
 private mines.                        
 Other employment sources are British  
 Steel Corporation, British Petroleum  
 and Metal Box Manufacturing Co.       
 Within the village itself the main    
 employer is The Creamline Bus Company 
 ; there is garage which services      
 vehicles - a family business which    
 employs 1 or 2 apprentices; the       
 non-teaching staff in the school are  
 all from the village; there is a      
 Mountain Centre which employs people  
 from the village.                     
 The farms in the area tend to be small
 and run by the families that own them.
