		<title>05Sunday family together.</title>
		<content> Sunday is  usually the only day in the
 week that we spend together as my     
 mother normaly works on a saturday.   
    We generally all stay In bed until 
 10.00 and then get up and have        
 breakfast.                            
   My mother prepares dinner and cleans
 up; Dad sometimes works in the garden 
 or cleans the car. My sister and I    
 normally play in the garden if the    
 weather is fine.                      
   After lunch we visit our            
 grandparents at Maes Y Cwmmer which is
 about seven miles away. After a two   
 hour visit we leave for home. During  
 Sunday evening we watch television and
 play games. The Kendrick week end is  
 full of activity.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
