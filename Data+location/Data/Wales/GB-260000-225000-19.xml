		<content> The village of  Salem  was  originally
 named Heol Galed (Hard Road). The main
 street  was one of  a network of Roman
 roads  linking the  gold mines at Caio
 with the various  staging posts in the
 area. It was also on the Drovers route
 to mid Wales and the Marches-   at one
 time there were four alehouses  in the
 village!   The name changed with time,
 by the use of 'Salem Heol Galed'  when
 referring to the Chapel. Cock fighting
 took place at a pit sited between  the
 Chapel and the Angel Inn.             
{CUSTOMS}  -St. David's Day  (dydd Gwyl
 Dewi Sant)  on March 1st,is celebrated
 by the community.   The children dress
 in traditional costume and many adults
 wear leeks or daffodils.    Many local
 organisations hold  folk  concerts and
 suppers with national fare.           
   The custom of 'First Footing' on 1st
 January is widely followed.           </content>
