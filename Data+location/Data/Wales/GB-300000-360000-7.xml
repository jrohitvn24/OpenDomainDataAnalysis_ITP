    The influence of religion in the   
 area is strong with 5 active          
 churches:the only Anglican one is in  
 Nantglyn village.Dedicated to St.     
 James it is 200 years old but there   
 has been a church on the site for 700 
 years.The 6 century Celtic saint      
 Modeyrn(sovereign of the sea) was     
 supposed to have a chapel and well    
 nearby.                               
    Famous men buried in the churchyard
 are Robert Davies(Bardd Nantglyn) and 
 Dr. William Owen Pughe the translator 
 and linguist of the early 19 century. 
    There is a yew tree the girth of   
 which is the linked outstretched hands
 of seven young schoolgirls. There are 
 steps in the tree leading up to a     
 pulpit said to have been used by John 
 Wesley.
