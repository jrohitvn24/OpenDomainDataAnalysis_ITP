		<title>20SUPERNATURAL IN MORFA BYCHAN</title>
		<content> A famous man of our past was Syr Howel
 y Fwyall(Sir Howel of the Axe) of Bron
 y Foel,always the most important farm 
 in the area.He fought for the Black   
 Prince at Poitiers and took the French
 king prisoner after cutting off his   
 horse's head with his battle axe.Howel
 died about 1372,but still haunts the  
 hillsides of his birthplace.          
 A ghostly visitor to the village is a 
 white stallion,thought by some to be  
 the French king's horse.One night he  
 peered in at a caravan window and     
 caused such terror that the family    
 inside returned to their safe home in 
 England next morning.
