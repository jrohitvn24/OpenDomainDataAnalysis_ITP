		<title>03TONMAWR TODAY - GENERAL</title>
		<content> The Pelenna Valley is steep sided,    
 with the{Pelenna River}running        
 north-east to south-west. The         
 Eastern side of the valley is         
 covered in conifer forests,but to the 
 West is high sheep pasture. The       
 valley is a culdesac, as far as       
 road traffic is concerned and so      
 gets few casual visitors passing      
 through.Two communities, Danycoed and 
 Tonmawr itself, are in the valley, but
 only the latter is in the Domesday    
 block.                                
 There are many signs of Tonmawr's     
 industrial past - the embankment on   
 which the railway ran, quarries from  
 which building stone was taken, and   
 the blocked up entrances to numerous  
 derelict drift mines but the spoil    
 tips associated with mining have gone.
 The general impression is rural and   
 beautiful.                            </content>
