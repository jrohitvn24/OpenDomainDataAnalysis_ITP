		<title>11EDUCATION IN NANTGLYN.</title>
		<content>    The present building has been a    
 school since 1859.Earlier the balcony 
 of St. James' Church was the classroom
 where Twm o'r Nant attended.This      
 colourful 18c. character wrote Welsh  
 morality plays known as Interludes.   
    There are 38 pupils in 2 classes   
 and all lessons are conducted in      
 Welsh.At 11 most transfer to the Welsh
 medium school, Ysgol Glan Clwyd, St.  
 Asaph 12 miles away. There is a       
 special school bus for them.          
    All the children like their school 
 as shown on the survey on page 12.    
    Over the last 10 years many English
 people have come to Nantglyn, and 11  
 of the 24 families represented in the 
 school are English speaking. The      
 school can still retain its totally   
 Welsh approach and it is supported in 
 this by the parents.
