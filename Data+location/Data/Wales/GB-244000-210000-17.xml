		<title>17EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY - QUARRY</title>
		<content>      There is only one working        
 quarry in this area and it is known as
 Fan Quarry.  This quarry has been     
 working for around six hundred years. 
      The materials extracted are mixed
 aggregates such as chippings and      
 duff, hardcore, agricultural lime and 
 coated macadams.                      
      Transportation of the above      
 mentioned materials is by lorry.      
      This quarry employs a workforce  
 of about twenty four.                 
      At one time there was a lime kiln
 at the quarry.                        
      There are many disused quarries  
 in the area, but they have been closed
 for many years.                       
      This quarry is situated at       
 Meinciau.
