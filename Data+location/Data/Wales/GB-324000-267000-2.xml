		<content>  There are six large farms in the area
 keeping cattle and sheep ranging in   
 size from about 100 to 500 acres,but a
 few small holdings are only about 20  
 acres-here the people have other jobs 
 as well.There are some cottages lived 
 in by people working in towns and also
 about 20 holiday homes which are empty
 for most of the year.Most houses are  
 old. The village of Whitton has about 
 12 houses and a small post office.Four
 of the houses are council houses and  
 one was built by the Forestry         
 Commission.There are no shops in      
 Whitton and no modern houses - the new
 est is about 30years old.A lot of the 
 land is owned by the Dame Anna Child's
 Charity which helps pay for the       
 village school and this has stopped a 
 lot of building in the area-lots of   
 other villages round here have new    
 houses.                               </content>
