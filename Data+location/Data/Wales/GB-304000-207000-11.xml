		<content>  . Dowlais Police Station is a modern 
 building set alongside a new housing  
 estate.It is called a SECTION and is  
 linked with the CENTRAL POLICE STATION
 MERTHYR TYDFIL two miles to the south.
 It has two floors.On the ground floor 
 there is a general office,a charge    
 room,a store room ,an inspection      
 office and two cells.Upstairs there   
 is a parade room,a store room,a rest  
 room,a locker room and a canteen.     
 Outside there is a car park,kennels   
 for the two police dogs,garages and   
 a room for stolen property.           
     We were taken around the station  
 by a very friendly Sergeant O'Keefe.  
 He showed us the riot equipment used  
 in the recent miner's strike.We tested
 the shields and helmets.They were very
 strong.Then we had our fingerprints   
 taken.It was really interesting.
