         _____________                 
 There are three police stations in our
 area,at Rachub,Tregarth and           
 Bethesda.The station at Rachub is     
 unmanned,the same as many other areas 
 in North Wales.Welsh speaking         
 policemen are scarce.Many people would
 like to see the return of the village 
 policeman.                            
           There is a lot of           
 vandalism,housebreaking and           
 hooliganism in our district.When the  
 criminals are arrested they are taken 
 to Bangor police station,about 4 miles
 away.The Magistrste court sits at     
 Bangor,but the serious crimes are     
 dealt with by the Crown court usually 
 at Caernarfon,Mold or Chester.A       
 policeman will help if you are in any 
 trouble-he is our friend.
