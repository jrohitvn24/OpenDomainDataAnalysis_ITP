		<title>10A FAMILY SURVEY IN BRIDGEND</title>
		<content> Unit 1  Father, mother, daughter 8.   
 Father - lecturer in College of       
 Technology. Mother - housewife.       
 Unit 2  Father, mother, sons 7 &amp; 10.  
 Father and mother - teachers.         
 Their weeks are taken up principally  
 in work, preparation for work,        
 shopping and leisure. One of the      
 mothers is undertaking an Open        
 University degree. Fathers help with  
 shopping and domestic chores. The main
 leisure pursuits for the adults are   
 walking, wine making and social       
 gatherings in local pubs. One father  
 is a keen gardener and has an         
 allotment, the other is interested in 
 conservation. Both groups assist their
 children with homework and the        
 children enjoy playing in New Bridge  
 fields and attending local clubs and  
 Brownies organisations.
