		<content> The most common type of farming in    
 Libanus area is hill sheep farming.   
 There are some cattle but they are    
 mostly bred for slaughter for meat or 
 breeding. A few farms have 2 or 3 cows
 for their home dairy supply they are  
 milked by hand. The most popular      
 winter food for the animals is silage 
 and hay some buy bags of animal cake. 
 Nearly all farmers send their yearling
 lambs to a milder area for winter     
 grazing. The most popular breeds of   
 sheep are Welsh, Suffolk and speckled.
 They are bred for their wool and meat.
 All the family help with the work on  
 the farm, neighbouring farmers help   
 each other at busy times such as      
 harvest and sheering. The two main    
 markets attended by farmers in the    
 area are Brecon (Friday and Tuesday)  
 and Sennybridge (Wednesday and        
 Friday).                              </content>
