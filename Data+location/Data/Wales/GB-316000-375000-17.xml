		<title>17A55 HOLYWELL BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The main A55(T) road into North Wales 
 carries heavy{freight traffic}from    
 Ireland to Britain and Europe. Since  
 Britain joined the E.E.C. this traffic
 has greatly increased. During the     
 summer{tourists}travelling by coaches 
 and cars, (many towing caravans),     
 create traffic jams at the Holywell   
 traffic lights as up to 3000 cars per 
 hour pass through.                    
 1985 saw the beginning of construction
 of the{A55 Holywell By-pass.}Due to be
 completed by the autumn of 1987 this  
 dual-carriageway follows a southerly  
 route around the town over Halkyn     
 Mountain. Among the obstacles to be   
 overcome are the many disused mine    
 shafts, a legacy of the lead mining.  
 Costing Â£13 million the by-pass forms 
 part of the planned{ Euro-route}      
 linking Ireland to Britain and the    
 continent.                            </content>
