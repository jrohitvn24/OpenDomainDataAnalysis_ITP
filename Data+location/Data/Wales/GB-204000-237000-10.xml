		<title>10Traditional Events.</title>
		<content> This May some local people tried to   
 play Cnapan for the first time for    
 many many years.Some say this was the 
 beginning of Rugby football and it was
 played between Newport and Nevern.    
 But there are some events that have   
 carried on almost without break for   
 many many years.                      
 Ffair Gurig is celebrated every last  
 week in June,we have our School Sports
 that Wednesday,there are many other   
 events but the main attraction is the 
 street fair with numerous stalls along
 Long St.                              
 We hav a Regetta,a Carnival,and I've  
 been smacked on Bedd Morys stone on   
 the Beating of the Bounds.            
 Our Mayor is the only mayor in Britain
 that is made the same time as the     
 Mayor of London in November.There is  
 also the Plygain,a Welsh service at   
 6a.m.Christmas Day which is different.</content>
