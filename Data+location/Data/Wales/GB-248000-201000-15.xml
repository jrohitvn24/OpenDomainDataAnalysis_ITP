		<content> In the late 1870s, Mr.C.W.Mansel      
 Lewis,squire of Stradey Estate,became 
 president of Llanelli (Scarlets)Rugby 
 Club and allowed the club to lay out a
 playing area within his walled        
 estate.  The club colours were then   
 blue,but two years later a decision to
 play in rose and primrose hoops was   
 not popularly received and eventually 
 in the season 1883_84,the Scarlet     
 jersey was approved.  The ground was  
 first situated alongside the Cille    
 Brook,almost on the exact area now    
 used by Llanelli Wanderers, and the   
 series of international matches staged
 at Llanelli in the late 1870s and     
 early 1880s were played on that       
 ground. {It is, in fact, the only     
{international ground on which Wales   
{has never been beaten!
