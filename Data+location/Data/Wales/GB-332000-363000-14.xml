		<content> receive the same sort of commercial   
 air traffic as, for instance,         
 Liverpool airport.   We do have visits
 from light aircraft, and managers from
 the various British Aerospace         
 factories around the country quite    
 often fly in aboard BAe. 125 business 
 jets or BAe Doves.   We also have a   
 flying club based here, which is part 
 of our Sports and Social Club, and    
 members use the Chipmunks, Beagle Pups
 and Cassnas that the section owns.    
 We no longer have a commercial air    
 service making regular flights from   
 the airfield.                         
 Our current employment rate is near   
 the 4,000 mark.                       
 If you need any other help with your  
 project please don't hesitate to      
 contact me.                           
             Yours sincerely,
