		<title>15PUBLIC TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN OUR AREA IS NOT   
 VERY GOOD, SO MOST FAMILIES HAVE TO   
 HAVE CARS OR BIKES. NONE OF THE       
 VILLAGES HAS ANY DECENT SIZED SHOPS,  
 SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRANSPORT TO GO   
 SHOPPING. MOST FAMILIES GO TO OSWESTRY
 OR WREXHAM TO SHOP AND USUALLY GO ON  
 THURSDAY OR FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN THE     
 SHOPS STAY OPEN LATE. WHEN PEOPLE GO  
 TO WORK, THE BUSES DON'T RUN OFTEN    
 ENOUGH, SO THEY HAVE TO GO BY CAR OR  
 BIKE. THE BUSES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. IT
 COSTS ABOUT Â£1.50 TO GO TO WREXHAM OR 
 OSWESTRY. WHEN OUR MUMS GO SHOPPING,  
 THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS SHE     
 BUYS:BREAD,MEAT,POTATOES,VEGETABLES,  
 FRUIT,BREAKFAST CEREALS,CAT AND DOG   
 FOOD,JAM,MARMALADE,FISH FINGERS,      
 BEEFBURGERS,PIZZAS,LEMONADE AND       
 TOILET ROLLS.
