		<title>16FARMING, FORESTRY</title>
		<content> Some planting of conifers to serve as 
 shelter belts has been carried out on 
 these farms for many decades and      
 several strips of mature timber which 
 are no longer of much use for shelter 
 are to be seen on the Cnewr land.     
 However a third aspect of the         
 integrated plan for Cnewr is to lease 
 larger tracts of land for coniferous  
 plantations.  Because of its situation
 within the Brecon Beacons National    
 Park there has been some controversy  
 about this aspect of the plan.        
 However in 1980 the Secretary of State
 for Wales finally decreed that        
 planting should go ahead.  Siting of  
 plantations has been done so skilfully
 that it is difficult to see where     
 planting has been done from any of the
 roads in this part of the area. It    
 shows that forestry does not necessar-
 ily conflict with amenitiy interests. </content>
