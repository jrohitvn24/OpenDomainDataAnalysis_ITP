		<content> At Tredustan Hall, the mean temp-     
 erature of the coldest month (January)
 is 3 degrees Celsius and that for the 
 warmest month (August) is 15 degrees. 
 These temperatures may be compared    
 with the temperatures recorded in the 
 adjacent area on Fan Frynych which    
 have been described under GR 02929222 
 as MOUNTAIN TEMPERATURES.  Because    
 Tredustan Hall is lower than Pont     
 Blaen-Cwm ddu, the average temperat-  
 ures are about one half degree warmer.
 The highest temperature recorded at   
 Tredustan Hall was 29 degrees C on    
 8th July 1984.   The coldest was the  
 remarkable -20.0 degrees Celsius on   
 14th January 1982.  However the       
 minimum temperature of -16 degrees C  
 on 12th December 1981 is also         
 noteworthy, particularly because it   
 occurred so early in the winter. Very 
 low tempeatures seldom come before Jan</content>
