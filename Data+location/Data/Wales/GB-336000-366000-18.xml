		<content>   The football stadium where 4th      
 division Chester play, and the        
 Greyhound Stadium where 100 dogs race 
 each week stand side-by-side on       
 Sealand Road. They not only attract   
 spectators to their sports, but       
 promising local boys may join the City
 Juniors club who train at Chester's   
 ground. Several locals keep greyhounds
 and may enter the races held on Monday
 and Saturday evenings if accepted at  
 trials.                               
   Residents must travel outside the   
 D-block to swim or use indoor sports  
 facilities. The nearest being at the  
 Northgate Arena in Chester.           
   The public may use playing fields at
 Blacon High and the former Bishop's   
 school. There are also several open   
 spaces for casual use by locals some  
 with swings etc. The adventure        
 playground on Kipling Rd is the best. </content>
