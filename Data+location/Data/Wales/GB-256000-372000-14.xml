		<content>     The environment in our block      
 supports much wildlife and plants.    
 This is because of the variety of     
 landscape such as sea and sea shore,  
 woodlands, open fields, hilly areas   
 and built-up parts.                   
     The Menai Strait provides living  
 conditions for many varieties of fish 
 e.g. cod,plaice, dog fish, eels, shell
 fish etc. The shore is a mixture of   
 rock, pebbles and mud flats. Birds    
 such as gulls, oystercatchers and     
 puffins.                              
     The woodlands mainly consist of   
 deciduous trees. Many of these trees, 
 especially oak, grow on the banks of  
 the Strait, and support both birds and
 animals. The most common birds are    
 thrushes, blackbirds, robins, tits,   
 magpies and chaffinches. Some of the  
 animals to be found include rabbits,  
 foxes, stoats and grey squirrels.     </content>
