  Every summer we shear the sheep.We   
 have to prepare for the shearing. We  
 had to make a place where we catch the
 sheep. Then make a place for the men  
 to shear.Then we go to get nettles to 
 put under the sheep because it does   
 not stick in the wool like straw.The  
 day after we go and get the sheep. I  
 have a sheep dog to help me go up the 
 hill to get the sheep down. We put the
 sheep in the shed. Then we begin the  
 shearing. Thereare two people         
 catching, four are searing the        
 sheep.There are some packing the wool 
 and putting it in bags. The men do    
 about 150 sheep a day. When they have 
 finished shearing and packing the wool
 in the bags we sell the wool.
