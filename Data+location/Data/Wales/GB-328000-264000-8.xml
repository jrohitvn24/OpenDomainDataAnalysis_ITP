 at the trial,Justice Harding always   
 visited her grave when he came to     
 Presteigne and later he died in the   
 town.The townspeople erected a        
{headstone}which reads:                
      'In memory of Mary Morgan who    
 suffered April 13th 1805,aged 17.He   
 that is without sin among you let him 
 first cast a stone at her......'      
     Fresh flowers are still placed    
 near her head stone by.....well nobody
 actually knows by whom!
