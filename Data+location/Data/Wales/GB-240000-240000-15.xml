		<title>15A SPORTING LIFE FOR ME</title>
		<content> Previously most sports activities took
 place in the public park or on the    
 local Grammar School fields. When it  
 was learnt that an area of land       
 adjacent to the park and river was to 
 be sold, a{Sports Association}was set 
 up to puchase the land for sports     
 facilities. The{Angling Club} put up  
 the purchase price of{Â£20,050}in{1981 
 and sold most of it to the Sports     
 Association for{Â£15,050}keeping the   
 rest for a fishing area. Various      
 grants, donations, and fund raising   
 activities help pay for the ground and
 its development.                      
 Much voluntary work has been done to  
 clear and level the ground and already
 the{football, cricket}and{hockey      
{pitches}and{tennis courts}are         
 installed, and a{bowling green}laid.  
 The Complex's development and use is  
 progressing satisfactorily.           </content>
