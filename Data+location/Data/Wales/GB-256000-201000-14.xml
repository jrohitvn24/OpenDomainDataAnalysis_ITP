 by Suzanne Robinson, aged 11.         
                                       
 The carnival was soon so Jennifer and 
 I decided to dress as Litterbugs. We  
 worked at our costumes and they were  
 ready for the Saturday. It was 12.45. 
 Jennifer came to my house. We changed 
 and travelled down to{Hendy Square}by 
 car. Judges wandered around deciding  
 on winners in each category. By 2.00  
 we had been judged and started walking
 down{St.Teilo Street.}We had pink,    
 orange and purple hair with black     
 sacks covered with all kinds of       
 litter. Everybody laughed at us and   
 somebody even thought we were         
 hedgehogs. We thoroughly enjoyed      
 ourselves even though we did not win. 
 At least we had tried. Now for next   
 year.
