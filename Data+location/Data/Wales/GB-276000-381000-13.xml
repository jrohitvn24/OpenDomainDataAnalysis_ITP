{Oriel Mostyn,}a major art gallery  run
 by an independent trust, is situated  
 on Vaughan Street. It is now in dire  
 financial trouble and has applied to  
 the Gwynedd County Council Finance    
 Committee for an interest-free loan.  
  The gallery, which opened in 1979,   
 organised a major exhibition in 1984 -
{The Turner in Wales Exhibition.}Around
 140 works by the major artist J.M.W.  
 Turner (1775-1851) were brought togeth
 -er from important collections through
 -out Britain and the exhibition       
 brought art lovers from a wide area to
 the town. Surprisingly, admission to  
 the exhibition was free.              
  There are three{Cinemas}in the town, 
 the Astra and the Palladium on Glodd- 
 aeth Street, and the Savoy on Mostyn  
 Street.
