		<title>02THE PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Church ,as it now stands, is a    
 building the architecture of which is 
 of a composite character. There are   
 portions of it, at the west end, which
 may probably be assigned to the early 
 part of the twelfth century, iif not  
 an even earlier date.                 
{A Norman column,}forming part of an   
 arcade, and adjoining  the present    
 square tower, was discovered during   
 restoration of the church in 1871.    
 The{easternmost window}in the south   
 wall of the church belongs to the     
 period of early pointed architecture. 
 The{east window of the south aisle    
 filled with painted glass in memory of
 members of the family of Mytton of    
 Penylan, is of the style called       
 Decorated.At the{west end}of this     
 aisle, a similar window, a gift from  
 Mrs. Hayhurst of Ystumcolwyn in memory
 of the husband, H.H. France Hayhurst  </content>
