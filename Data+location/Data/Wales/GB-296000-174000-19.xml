		<content>  Most of the people in our area take  
 part in recreation activities.        
 Unfortunately the ability to pursue   
 certain sports or other leisure time  
 activities is hampered by the lack of 
 the neccessary facilities. Cowbridge  
 Athletic Club provides facilities for 
 outdoor sports such as rugby, tennis  
 and cricket. The Comprehensive School 
 allows its pitches to be used by local
 teams but demand for pitches is far   
 greater than the supply. There is no  
 large meeting hall, however a new     
 leisure centre is being built in the  
 Bear Field.There is no public         
 swimming pool in the area. We surveyed
 the children in our school and the    
 most popular outdoor hobbies were     
 horse riding, cycling and gardening.  
 The main clubs children belonged to   
 were Gym, Brownies and Cubs. Popular  
 indoor sports were squash and ballet. </content>
