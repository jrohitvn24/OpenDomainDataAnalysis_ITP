		<title>08THE HEALTH CENTRE</title>
		<content> When Dr.Humphreys first came to       
 Crickhowell in 1948 there were only   
 two doctors and the surgery was at    
 Bryn-Rhos. They moved to Llanbedr Road
 and then employed a secretary.They are
 now at the{War Memorial Health Centre 
 where they employ many people. There  
 are now four doctors plus two training
 doctors. A Dentist, Chiropodist, and  
 an Optician all use the Health Centre 
 at certain times.                     
 The medical profession now prefers to 
 treat their patients at the surgery   
 and make fewer home visits than was   
 once the case.                        
 The main attempt in medicine is       
{prevention}which they do by           
 encouraging good health practice,i.e. 
 exercise, no smoking and good eating  
 habits.
