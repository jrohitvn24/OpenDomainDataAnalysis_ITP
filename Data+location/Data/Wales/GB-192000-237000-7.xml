 In the year 1797 the French sent an   
 invasion force to Britain.  The French
 were heading towards Bristol, but     
 strong winds took them off course.    
 They landed in Carreg Wastad Bay on   
 the Pembrokeshire coast.  They marched
 inland.  The first farm they came to  
 was Trehowel.                         
  They took over Trehowel and made it  
 their strong_hold.  Then they marched 
 on to Brestgarn.  They raided Llanwnda
 village and one of the prisoners stole
 the church plate.  They stormed St.   
 Nicholas village but did not go much  
 further south.                        
  At Trehowl the French commander who  
 was an American soldier called Tate   
 decided to surrender.  They           
 surrendered at Goodwick beach and they
 signed a peace treaty at the Royal Oak
