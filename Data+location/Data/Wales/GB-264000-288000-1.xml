		<content> The block which we are studying now is
 in the Northen part of the county of  
 Dyfed,in Ceridigion the area is a     
 rural one with many farms,some        
 woodlands run by the Forestry Comision
 and some privately owned.Most of these
 are coniferous although some are      
 deciduous.                            
     Almost in the middle of our block 
 is the village of Talybont which is   
 one of the largest in Ceridigion.In   
 Talybont the language is mixed        
 beetween English and Welsh but in the 
 surounding countryside the language is
 mostly Welsh.There are two rivers in  
 our block,(the Leri and the Ceulan)   
 both have a woolen mill on and there  
 is also a flour mill .                
     The North-West corner of our block
 is a peat bog called Cors Fochno it is
 one of two in Wales.There are also two
 Iron Age forts.                       </content>
