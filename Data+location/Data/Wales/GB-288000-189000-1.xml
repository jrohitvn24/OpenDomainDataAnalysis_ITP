		<title>01The location of Pontycymer</title>
		<content>  Pontycymer, a mining settlement,     
 eight miles north of Bridgend,on the  
 South Wales coalfield, stands on the  
 River Garw which has cut a deep       
 "V-shaped" valley and it is in the    
 narrow valley bottom that Pontycmer   
 grew up.                              
  The Mid Glamorgan anticline          
 brings coal fairly close to the       
 surface, and thus Pontycymer's growth 
 has been based entirely on the coal   
 industry. The Garw Valley can be      
 considered as typical of any of the   
 South Wales Coalfield valleys through 
 its industrial history, social and    
 economic structures and physical      
 setting.                              
  As most other mining areas, it has   
 gradually declined since its peak     
 before the First World War. This      
 decline, unfortunately highlights the 
 plight of all South Wales Valleys .   </content>
