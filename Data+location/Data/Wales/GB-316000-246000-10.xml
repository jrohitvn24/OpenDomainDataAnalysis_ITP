		<content> The only food{supermarket}was opened  
 in October 1982 by a family which came
 to the area, built a small private    
 housing estate and then fronted it    
 with a shop. It is used by about 175  
 people weekly. The shop keeper has    
 doubts if she would establish a shop  
 elsewhere as this one has to be       
 subsidized by herself. Those who do   
 not use it go to Hay, Brecon, Builth  
 or to Hereford. Price is the deciding 
 factor. Most women have large deep    
 freezers and buy in bulk also there   
 are travelling shops for groceries,   
 clothes and household goods as well as
 the daily milkman. The{post office}is 
 used by about 20 people each week. Its
 greatest problem is that not all use  
 it. The{building society}office housed
 in the shops is well used. It         
 encounters few problems. The main     
 investors are children!               </content>
