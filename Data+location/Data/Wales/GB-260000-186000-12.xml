		<title>12From Mumbles to Abercregan</title>
		<content> Our class went on a field studies     
 week to Abercregan.There is a great   
 difference between Mumbles and        
 Abercregan.The first thing we noticed 
 was that there was no castle,park or  
 shop.There was a small Post Office,but
 we were disappointed as it sold no    
 sweets.There was no beach as we were  
 away from the sea and no boats or     
 promenade.Sixty out of every hundred  
 people in the area were unemployed.   
 During the week we went on long walks 
 of between five and ten miles.While we
 were on the walks we saw farms in use 
 and in ruins,also coal tips and we    
 walked through conifer forests.We     
 tested soil and air temperature,soil  
 drainage and acidity,and windspeed.   
   At night we slept in bunks in       
 dormitories.By Carlo Crooks.
