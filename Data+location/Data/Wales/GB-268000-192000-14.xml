		<content> Llandarcy in 1918. In 1920 the Queen's
 Dock was opened to handle this trade  
 and in the 1950's oil imports and     
 exports through the Dock totalled 8m  
 tons per annum. The Queen's Dock today
 also handles the Port's extensive     
 petro_chemical traffic. The Port also 
 acts as a supply base for the         
 off_shore oil rigs in the Celtic Sea  
 and has dealt with a number of oil    
 drilling vessels and supply ships in  
 connection with exploration to date.  
 Because of its inability to take large
 tankers, the import of crude oil into 
 Swansea has declined.  Today most of  
 Llandarcy's crude comes via pipeline  
 from Milford Haven. The Queen's Dock  
 still handes exports from Baglan Bay  
 Petro_Chemical Works.                 
 Other commodities passing through the 
 port include aluminium, dredged       
 sand,quartzstone and manganese ore.   </content>
