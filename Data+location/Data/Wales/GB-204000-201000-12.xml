{the householders are car owners,}with 
 50% using the car for work.{40% have  
{more than 1 car.                      
{ The Pembroke Dock to Tenby bus route 
{passes through the area,}but it is not
 a regular service and is probably     
 subsidised by the County Council. An  
{Express Coach passes once a day on the
{Haverfordwest to Bristol route.}About 
 40% of the children at Primary level  
 travel by bus to school and the       
 majority of Secondary School children.
