		<content> 9am Saturday morning my mother woke me
 and gave me my comic to read. Then I  
 had my{breakfast}of cereal and fruit  
 juice. My father was still in bed     
 after coming home from work at 6am.   
 Afterwards I dressed and watched      
 television until it was time for my   
 music lesson at{Garth.}I went there on
 the local{bus}paying 10p fare. During 
 my lesson I had theory and played on  
 the piano and organ. My father picked 
 me up and we called at the fish shop  
 to take home portions of fish and     
 chips. After lunch we went by car to  
{Mumbles}where we walked along the     
 seashore. On the way home we called at
{Joe's Ice-cream Parlour.}That evening 
 we changed into our old clothes and   
 watched television. Saturday is an    
 excepton because I can stay up later  
 than usual but when I go to bed I fall
 fast asleep.                          </content>
