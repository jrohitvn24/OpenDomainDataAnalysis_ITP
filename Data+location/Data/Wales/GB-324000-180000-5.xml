		<title>05    SCHOOL AND BIRDS</title>
		<content> Our school has three houses.          
 Each child belongs to a house.        
 The houses, which are like teams,     
 compete against each other for sport  
 and other activities.                 
 Each house has a special name and     
 colour.The colours are red,white and  
 green.They have been taken from the   
 Welsh National Flag.                  
       The houses have been given the  
 names of birds found locally.Red house
 is called Kestrel.The Kestrel reminds 
 us of red blood.White house is called 
 Heron.The Heron is an elegant white   
 bird.Green house is called Mallard    
 because the Mallard duck has beautiful
 green colours.
