		<title>06A WELSH MOUNTAIN FARM.</title>
		<content>   In May we visited Gwrhyd Uchaf farm.
 We travelled from school by car and   
 reached the farm by travelling down a 
 rough dirt track.                     
   The farm is owned by Mr. and Mrs.   
 Davies and their three children. Mr.  
 Davies has a full-time job so Mrs.    
 Davies is the farmer. They have lived 
 there for thirty years but the        
 farmhouse is ninety years old.        
   The farm is average in size. There  
 are 165 acres, about 30 fields in all.
 Most of the land is rough hillside so 
 the main stock is Welsh Mountain      
 sheep. At the time of our visit they  
 had 600 ewes, 15 rams and 800 lambs.  
 It was the tail end of the lambing    
 season but there were still twenty    
 ewes waiting to give birth. All the   
 ewes are scanned to see how many lambs
 they are going to have. Many have     
 twins,a few have triplets.            </content>
