		<title>12Shopping Precinct in Cwmbran</title>
		<content>   At Greenwillows Shopping Precinct   
 there are six shops employing about 15
 staff. These are a grocer, a butcher, 
 a green-grocer and newsagent with a   
 post-office,a general store and a     
 hair-dressers. There has been a wool  
 shop, pet shop and a chemist.         
   People find these local shops very  
 convenient and enjoy the personal     
 service. The majority go daily for    
 small items of food and newspapers.   
   The most busy days are Tuesday and{ 
 Thursday when pensions and allowances 
 are paid and Saturday when people are 
 home from work.                       
   Some people would like to have a    
 fish and chip shop, others a          
 dispensing chemist, here as well.
