		<title>07RHYMNEY VALLEY LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>                                       
 The town of Rhymney is situated at the
 top end of the Rhymney Valley, through
 which the Rhymney River flows.        
   The Valley itself is shaped rather  
 like a marrow bone, with the town of  
 Rhymney situated in the wide part at  
 the head of the valley.Between the top
 and the bottom of the valley, the     
 houses are built on the sides of the  
 mountains which are rather steep in   
 parts.This has, in effect, produced a 
 landscape of{ribbon development,}with 
 long rows of terraced housing.This  is
 in complete contrast to the rather    
 more flattened effect of Rhymney Town.
  The River Rhymney eventually flows   
 into the Bristol Channel at           
 Rumney, Cardiff,                      
 having flowed through one of the most 
 industrial valleys of South Wales.
