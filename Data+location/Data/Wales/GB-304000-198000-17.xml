		<title>17CLIMATE AND VEGETATION</title>
		<content> The climate is classed as {maritime}  
 due to the prevailing westerly winds  
 from the Atlantic Ocean.The winters   
 are generally mild.February is the    
 coldest month with an average         
 temperature of 40 degrees F and August
 the warmest month with an average of  
 60 degrees F.The rainfall is heavy    
 with about 725mm per year,most of     
 which falls in late autumn and winter.
                                       
 The natural vegetation is deciduous   
 with examples of oak,beech and elm.On 
 the higher ground the trees are       
 stunted due to the high winds.On the  
 mountain tops, the trees are replaced 
 by poor grasses,ferns and heathers.   
                                       
 Soils are poor due to heavy rainfall  
 and are wet,cold and infertile.
