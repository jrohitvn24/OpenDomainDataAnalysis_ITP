		<content> The river Ogmore rises above Nantymoel
 and flows to Ogmore by Sea, joined by 
 the tributaries Garw and Llynfi.      
 People fish for trout sewin and salmon
 but the water is sometimes polluted.  
 The river has flooded the town, so in 
 1984 the Welsh Water Authority        
 widened and deepened it. The banks    
 where sand martins used to nest are   
 now concrete.                         
 In 1982 the M4 motorway link between  
 London and West Wales was completed.  
 Rapide coaches travel between London  
 and Bridgend in under 3 hours.        
 Bridgend bus station, the first in S. 
 Wales was opened in 1922. The railway 
 was designed and built in 1830 by     
 Brunel. In 1960 B.R. closed the valley
 lines. The intercity diesel London to 
 Fishguard travels at 125 mph and was  
 introduced in 1976.
