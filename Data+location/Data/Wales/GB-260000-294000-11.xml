		<content>    Children were called to school by a
 large bell which could be heard all   
 over the village.They had to be in the
 playground before the bell stopped.   
 Three age groups were taught in the   
 same classroom at the same time.There 
 was no heating other than a large coal
 fire.This was surrounded by a massive 
 fireguard and on a cold day five      
 children at a time were allowed to    
 warm their hands by the fire.         
    Every morning all the children     
 gathered in the hall and were tested  
 on their tables.A correct answer meant
 they could go out to play.            
    A childrens' policeman visited     
 homes to check on children absent from
 school.The accepted punishment for    
 naughty children was the cane.        
{   Bramford Primary School would like 
{to place on record their thanks to Mr.
{Lewis for his interest in their work. </content>
