 full time workers in the village at   
 the time of the survey were:          
 Pontypool(19%),Cwmbran(16%),          
 Mamhilad(10%) and Newport(9%).        
      The village is well located in   
 relation to these centres with links  
 via the {A4042}trunk road between     
 Abergavenny and Newport.In particular,
 the construction of the{New Inn}      
 By-Pass,completed in 1982,has improved
 the journey to work for residents     
 working in Pontypool,Newport and      
 Cwmbran.                              
     It was found that {76%}of the     
 workforce travelled by car and only{6%
 travelled to work by bus,mainly to    
 Pontypool and Mamhilad.{13%}of the    
 workforce had jobs in and around the  
 village itself.Figures released in    
 1979 revealed no serious unemployment 
 problems.                             </content>
