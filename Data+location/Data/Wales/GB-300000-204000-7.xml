		<title>07Sarah's Day in Heolgerrig.</title>
		<content>    At 7.30 I get up to watch Breakfast
 T.V. for half an hour.   I have a     
 breakfast of cornflakes and orange    
 juice, after  I run upstairs to dress.
 My mother who teaches at Pen y Dre    
 Comprehensive School drives me to     
 school on her way to work.            
    I go to Heolgerrig Primary School. 
 Lessons start at 09.00 and finish at  
 15.30.   I walk home and arrive at    
 about 15.45.   As soon as I get home I
 do my homework then watch TV for half 
 an hour.   I play the flute and violin
 and that takes up at least two and a  
 half hours of my time each day.       
    When I have finished I watch TV for
 the remainder of the night until 21.30
 and that's when I go to bed.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
