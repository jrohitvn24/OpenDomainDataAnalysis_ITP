		<content> The older houses in Risca are mainly  
 made natural stone from the nearby    
 quarries.But like thr rest of the     
 country,the newer houses are made of  
 red or other coloured brick.Risca was 
 a very small town surrounded by hill  
 and field,until in the last 25 years  
 they started developing one of the    
 biggest housing estates in the        
 area.Which has doubled the population 
 of Risca.Most of the houses are       
 teraced,mostly two bedroomed without  
 side tiolets.Most of the council      
 houses are peblle-dashed,with steel   
 window frames and vary from two to    
 four bedrooms. A lot of the houses    
 still use coal for heating. All the   
 old houses had slate rooves.even the  
 newer houses are built with           
 chimneys.Alot of people are now having
 their houses modernised by having     
 replacement windows and doors.        </content>
