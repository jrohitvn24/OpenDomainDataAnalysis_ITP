		<title>15A Night Shift Coalminer</title>
		<content> At 9 p.m. my father catches the miners
 bus which takes him from the bottom of
 our hill to the Nantgarw Windsor      
 Colliery about 25 miles away. He      
 arrives at about 9.50 p.m. and goes to
 the canteen for a glass of milk or    
 tea. At 10.50 p.m. he goes to the     
 lockers and changes into his working  
 clothes. Then he goes to the lamproom 
 and collects his lamp and self-rescuer
 . When he is ready he gives a signal  
 to the winder who lowers him down a   
 shaft. When he arrives at the pit     
 bottom he leaves the cage and catches 
 the train.The train takes him for     
 about a mile to his place of work. Ay 
 22.30 a.m. he stops for 20 minutes to 
 have a dink and some sandwiches. His  
 shift finishes at 5.30 a.m. When he   
 arrives back on the surface he returns
 his equipment, has a shower and       
 catches the bus home.                 </content>
