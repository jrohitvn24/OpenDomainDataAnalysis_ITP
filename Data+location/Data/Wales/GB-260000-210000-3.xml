		<title>03AMMANFORD'S WEEKLY MARKET</title>
		<content>  A survey was conducted in Ammanford's
 Friday market, with 20 shoppers and 12
 stall holders being interviewed.      
  It was found that 90% of the shoppers
 lived within 6 miles of Ammanford, 40%
 living in the town itself. Over half  
 the people had travelled in by car,   
 only 2 came by bus; this could be why 
 30% suggested the parking facilities  
 should be improved. Almost 75% of the 
 shoppers said they came to the market 
 because it was cheap, indeed 55% said 
 they attend weekly and 65% had bought 
 items on that particular day.         
  Of the stall holders, 3 came from    
 Swansea and 6 from other places in    
 SE.Wales. Over half said they found   
 the town's facilities good, that trade
 was fair but that business had fallen 
 during the 1984-85 coal strike and    
 trade had not yet recovered.
