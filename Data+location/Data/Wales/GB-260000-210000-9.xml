		<content>  Every weekday I get up at 6.30. I    
 shower and dress by 7.30. Then I join 
 my sister Anne, for a light breakfast.
  We usually watch TV-AM until 8.30    
 when it's time to leave for school.   
  I am in the 3rd year and Anne's in   
 the 4th year in the A.V.C.S. School   
 is just down the road from home and so
 we arrive in time for the 8.40 bell.  
  We have 8 lessons a day, 2 before    
 morning break, 3 before and after     
 lunch. Although there is a canteen I  
 always go home for lunch. School      
 finishes at 3.05.                     
  My favourite lesson is English. I'm  
 not very fond of History. Every       
 Tuesday I attend the local Urdd Aelwyd
 and on a Wednesday I have Drama and   
 Elocution lessons. I am allowed to    
 watch only 2 hours of TV. each night. 
  When I leave school I want to be a   
 solicitor,like my father.             </content>
