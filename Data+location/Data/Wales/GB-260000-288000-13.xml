		<title>13MY HOME _ BORTH</title>
		<content>    We came to live in our home in     
 1982. Before us, it was a holiday     
 home. From our bedroom window we can  
 see the church, cliff, beach, village 
 and Borth bog, and opposite is the    
 Youth Centre.                         
    There are six houses in our row,   
 they are all now permanently lived in.
 Number 1 used to be a holiday home    
 until last summer.                    
    When we look through our           
 binoculars, we can see all the way    
 down to Ynyslas and Aberdyfi. Dad has 
 built a bird table in the corner of   
 our garden, so we can watch the birds 
 through our window. We put            
 breadcrumbs, crushed biscuits and nuts
 for them to eat. The most common bird 
 we see is the Blue Tit and the rarest 
 bird we have seen was a Greenfinch. A 
 black and white Wagtail comes         
 sometimes.                            </content>
