		<content> On the basis of interviewing young    
 adults in the age group of eighteen to
 twenty one, the main form of          
 recreation appeared to be visiting    
 public houses and various social clubs
 i.e. working mens clubs, and political
 clubs. Other interests were shown to  
 be sporting, swimming, football,      
 rugby, snooker,pool and jogging. Among
 this age group there were many who    
 were unemployed and these people      
 obviously had more leisure time than  
 people who were employed. Adults in   
 the 21+ age bracket gave the following
 leisure activities, family outings,   
 jogging, gardening, cars, reading,    
 walking, wine making, television and  
 video films, golf, cricket and playing
 darts. In this age group the interests
 were less regularly followed and the  
 reason given was family committments  
 and demands of work.                  </content>
