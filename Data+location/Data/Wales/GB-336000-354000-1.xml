		<title>01COOK'S BRIDGE FARM</title>
		<content> Cook's Bridge Farm is a dairy farm,   
 with 132 dairy cattle and 70 beef     
 cattle. The farmer gets up at 6 AM and
 at 6.30 AM he starts to milk the cows;
 this usually takes about 2 hours.The  
 milk is collected at 9.00 AM by a     
 tanker from the M.M.B.                
 The farmer does not own the farm;it is
 owned by the council.4 people work on 
 the farm,they are _the farmer,his son 
 and two workmen. There are six large  
 buildings on the farm,these include   
 the farm house &lt;which was built before
 Rossett Mill_approx 1500 AD>, two     
 large barns, a milking parlor and a   
 cow shed.                             
 The farm has 214 acres of land for    
 grazing and 42 acres for growing      
 barley crops.We saw the cow shed where
 the in_heifer cows slept.When we      
 went in the cows mooed so noisily that
 we couldn't hear ourselves speak.     </content>
