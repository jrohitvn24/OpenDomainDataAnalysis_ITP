		<content> Within our block the majority of      
 people are {bi-lingual.}The languages 
 spoken are {English}and {Welsh.}      
      There are two villages within our
 block and both these villages have    
 their names taken from welsh          
 descriptive words.                    
      One of these villages is {       
{Brynamman }formerly known as {Gwter   
{Fawr.  }Brynamman translated means the
 "hill near the Amman (local river)"   
 whereas Gwter Fawr translates to "the 
 large gutter".  The other village {   
{Glanamman }translates to "the banks of
 the river Amman".                     
      Of the two schools within the    
 block one is a Welsh medium school    
 and the other is a bi-lingual school. 
      The welsh language is kept alive 
 in the community by various cultural  
 and leisure groups.
