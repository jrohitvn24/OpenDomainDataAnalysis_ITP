		<title>20Changing Face of Glanaman.</title>
		<content>    Changes have taken, and are taking 
 place in the Glanaman area.           
    Coal mining is no longer a major   
 source of employment for the local    
 people. Unemployment is now a major   
 concern, with 50% of all workers      
 unemployed.                           
    Tracts of local farmland have been 
 altered by opencast mining; hedges    
 having been uprooted and waste        
 material deposited in the topsoil.    
    Therefore, although Glanaman no    
 longer depends economically on the    
 coal industry, the consequences of its
 development will remain with the area 
 for some time to come.
