		<title>08VOICES OF LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> Population 1007 at the last census,   
 including 380 men, 412 women and 215  
 children under 16.  210 or 26.5%      
 drawing Old Age Pension.  Of these 74 
 are men over 65 and 136 women over 60.
 Average of 15 babies born each year.  
 In the past Laugharne had two distinct
 classes, one of professional or       
 retired shop-keepers and small traders
 owning their own houses and the other 
 of manual and farm workers, fishermen 
 and women, in rented cottages.  The   
 distinction between the two groups has
 largely disappeared and there are no  
 barriers to social intercourse        
 nowadays. A branch of the Conservative
 Party in Laugharne hold fund-raising  
 events and address envelopes as does  
 one member of the Ecology (Green)     
 Party.  Politics play no part in      
 candidature for any of the tiers of   
 local government.                     </content>
