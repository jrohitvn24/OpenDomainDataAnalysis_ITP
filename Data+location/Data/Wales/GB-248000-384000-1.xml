		<title>01SUMMARY OF MOELFRE DISTRICT</title>
		<content>                                       
      Our area contains three villages.
 Moelfre, the largest has a population 
 of 1,500 and is compact. Marianglas   
 the middle size has the population of 
 300. Penrhoslligwy has a population of
 approx. 150. These two are widespread.
         The coastline is rocky with   
 sandy beaches in the S.E. Moelfre is  
 Welsh for "Bare area", and has very   
 few trees. Marianglas    which means  
 "Green common" is built around common 
 land. Penrhoslligwy, which means "The 
 marsh above the river Lligwy",has a   
 main road running through it.         
          Many visitors stay in the    
 district during summer. It is quiet in
 the winter.                           
           The rock found here is      
 mainly lime-stone. Bodafon Mountain   
 which over looks the district is      
 granite.PETER WALKER.                 </content>
