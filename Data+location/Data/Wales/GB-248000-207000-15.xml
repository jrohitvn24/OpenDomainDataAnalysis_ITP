		<content> Apart from the B4309 road,which runs  
 from Carmarthen to Llanelli,and the   
 B4317,which runs from Pontyates to    
 Pontyberem,which are 2 laned,the rest 
 of the roads in this area are single  
 track with passing places.Two bus     
 companies run services on the main    
 roads.They are South Wales Transport  
 and Eynons Buses.                     
 British Rail own the mineral railway  
 which runs past Cynheidre.This railway
 was first opened in the early 19th    
 century to transport coal,limestone   
 and iron ore to Llanelli.No coal has  
 been transported on this line since   
 the Miners' strike of 1984-85.This was
 a decision made by British Rail.The   
 coal is now transported by road so the
 number of large lorries on the B4309  
 is greatly increased.
