		<content>           THE QUARRY                  
           __________                  
 The main industry in our area is the  
 PENRHYN SLATE QUARRY .It employs about
 250 men,but during the early 1900's   
 there were nearly 3000 men working    
 there.That is how our village         
 started,with the men moving here to   
 work in the quarry.It makes roofing   
 slates and granite chippings for road 
 surfacing.It is the largest open cast 
 quarry in the world.                  
                     We are not allowed
 to visit the quarry because it is very
 dangerous there.They have lorries and 
 cranes to dig out the slate,but in the
 old days the men used to blast it out 
 of the mountain.Men are still needed  
 to split the slate_no machine can ever
 do that accurately.The slate tips are 
 an eyesore in our beautiful           
 countryside.                          </content>
