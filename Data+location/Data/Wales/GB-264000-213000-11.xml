		<content>    Bro Ryan is a housing complex built
 specifically for the elderly. It      
 opened in 1984 and was named after the
 late Ryan Davies, a local entertainer.
    The complex consists of a number of
 bungalows built around a central hall.
 Each house is a separate and complete 
 unit, which can be adapted for use by 
 the disabled, and is linked to the    
 warden's residence by an intercom     
 system. This provides each resident   
 with a method of contacting the       
 warden, who is on call 24 hours a day.
    The community hall is the heart of 
 the housing complex, where residents  
 come together to meet, make friends   
 and to enjoy numerous entertainments. 
    Present-day (1985) residents number
 42 men and women, the oldest being a  
 lady of 92. They live within a secure,
 caring community, whilst maintaining  
 their independance.                   </content>
