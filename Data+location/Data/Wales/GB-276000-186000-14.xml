		<title>14FARMING</title>
		<content>      There is only one farm which is  
 situated on the MYNYDD MARGAM         
 moutain.Its main activity being       
 the breeding of sheep for both        
 meat and wool.                        
      In the past one of the main      
 industries was that of farming, it    
 still is in some sections of the      
 borough but not in Margam or Taibach. 
 Here the onslaught of the steel making
 industry has steadily encrouched upon 
 the farm land until all that is left  
 is very hill terrain, unsuitable for  
 many forms of farming. Perhaps a      
 typical case of how society changed   
 with the industrial revolution.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
