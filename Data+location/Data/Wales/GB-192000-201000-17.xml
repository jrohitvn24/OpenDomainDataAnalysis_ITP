		<title>17Pembroke Power Station Pt 3.</title>
		<content> The stack is actually 4 chimneys in 1.
 Dust is removed before the waste is   
 emitted,by means of a grit arrester   
 which spins and drags the dust to one 
 side.The waste leaves the top of the  
 stack at a speed of 50 m.p.h.which    
 further helps in it's dissipation.On  
 the site there is a secondary,self    
 contained gas turbine power station,  
 producing a maximum 100 megawatts,but 
 due to very high running costs (10    
 times that of oil) it is used only in 
 dire emergencies.It can however be    
 utilised at the flick of a switch and 
 was used a lot during the recent year 
 long coal strike.The station employs a
 total of 500 people having an annual  
 wage bill of Â£5,000,000.This,with the 
 Â£5,000,000 annual running costs and   
 Â£3,000,000 annual rate bill from the  
 local authority,makes it a very       
 important asset to the locality.      </content>
