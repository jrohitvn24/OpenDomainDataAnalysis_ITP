		<content> Denbigh is surrounded by beautiful and
 varied countryside.The open           
 countryside is easily accessible by an
 intricate{public footpath}system.The  
 Ramblers Association and local Civic  
 Society are endeavouring to make sure 
 that the less frequently used rights  
 of way are reopened or kept open for  
 future generations.                   
             The Civic Society is also 
 involved with architectural and       
{natural conservation}in the area.The  
 local council have been made aware of 
 this and pressure brought about by    
 this society.                         
             The housing development at
 Bwa Fflats has been suspended as a    
 result of public pressure.It is hoped 
 by many that future building will take
 place within existing boundaries and  
 not on randomly chosen land as has    
 seemingly been past practice.         </content>
