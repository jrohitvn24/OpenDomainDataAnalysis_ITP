		<content>{Deeside lies along the south-west     
{slope of the Dee valley.} The         
 settlement consists of the historic   
 village of Hawarden,the Aston Park    
 Estate and the town of Shotton. There 
 are rail links to Holyhead,Chester,   
 Wrecsam, and Liverpool. The A494 which
 carries 3000 vehicles per hour        
 connects the M56 with the A55 N.Wales 
 coast road. On the south-east valley  
 slope lies the Shotton steelworks ,   
 the major employer till its' partial  
 closure in 1981. The unemployment     
 level is some 20% but the Deeside     
 Industrial Estate, Sealand now        
 attracts small scale industry to the  
 area. Farming is mainly pastoral with 
 some market gardening on the sandy    
 soils of the valley floor. Facilities 
 for recreation include the Deeside    
 Leisure centre and Wepre wood, a large
 area of woodland much used by locals. </content>
