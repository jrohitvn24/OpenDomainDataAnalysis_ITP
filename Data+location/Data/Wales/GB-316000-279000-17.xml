		<title>17    BEGUILDY POTTERY</title>
		<content>    Beguildy Pottery is in a cottage   
 opposite Beguildy Church and was      
 opened in 1984. Mr. Jim Galbraith     
 is the potter. He makes jugs, cups and
 saucers, plant pots and vases. Cathy  
 Taggart makes jewellery and sometimes 
 vases. They use white china clay from 
 Cornwall and brown clay from The      
 Potteries in Staffordshire. Jim has   
 two electric wheels for throwing his  
 pots. He has a small electric-firing  
 kiln in his workshop and he has also  
 built a much bigger kiln outside. He  
 experiments with different powders to 
 decorate his pots in different ways.  
 He sells his pottery in a shop in     
 front of his workshop and he sells to 
 dealers who come from different parts 
 of the country. Some of his pottery is
 on display in the village shop. Jim   
 and Cathy welcome visitors to the     
 pottery for demonstrations.           </content>
