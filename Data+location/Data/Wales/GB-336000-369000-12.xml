		<content>   The Saughall area is flat;          
 underneath is sandstone covered with  
 clay. It is a very green and leafy    
 place, with grass fields which are    
 basically rectangular.Most have hedges
 and shallow ditches for boundaries and
 many have ponds. You see mature       
 deciduous trees, telegraph poles and  
 pylons.                               
                                       
   There are two main roads in our     
 block but most are narrow, quiet      
 lanes. Saughall village is a          
 residential place, Mollington and     
 Backford are much smaller villages.   
 Public Footpaths allow you to cross   
 fields.                               
                                       
   The canal runs through a valley,    
 crossed on a viaduct by the Birkenhead
 to Chester railway.
