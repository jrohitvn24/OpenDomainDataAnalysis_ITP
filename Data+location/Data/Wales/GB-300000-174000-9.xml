		<content>   There are 31 houses in Aberthin, and
 although there are no shops, there are
 two pubs. 15 people attend churches in
 Cowbridge regulary. Most people like  
 the country area, but complain about  
 the lack of amenities. The most       
 popular entertainment is the cinema,  
 and most people enjoy visiting the    
 local pubs. Almost all the villagers  
 have pets, cats being most popular. 17
 people have 2 cars and as most work   
 in Cardiff or Bridgend, Aberthin can  
 therefore be seen as a commuting      
 village. The (B.4270) runs directly   
 through Aberthin, and this provides   
 easy access to nearby towns. Almost   
 all children attend schools in        
 Cowbridge, car again being the main   
 form of transport. Most children      
 attend youth organisations, eg.scouts,
 and most adults do not object strongly
 to blood sports, eg. hunting.         </content>
