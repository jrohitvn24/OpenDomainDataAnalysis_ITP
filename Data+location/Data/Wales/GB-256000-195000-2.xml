		<title>02Farming at Cefn Stylle.</title>
		<content> The farm that we visited was on the   
 way to Penclawdd,about three miles    
 from our school.                      
      There are three farms in one at  
 this site,Cefn Stylle,Berthlwyd Uchaf 
 and Pant y Cob.The farm covers 400    
 acres,half of which is tidal land     
 which can be used to graze animals in 
 the summer                            
      Mr Evans keeps 400 breeding ewes 
 which in a good year produce about 600
 lambs,The busiest time of year is in  
 March and early April during the      
 lambing season.It is not unusual for  
 the farmer and his son to stay up all 
 night to make sure the lambs are      
 healthy and safe.                     
      There are 150 cows on the        
 farm,they are bought at auction in the
 autumn.They are fed under shelter     
 during the winter months to fatten    
 them ready to sell to the butcher.    </content>
