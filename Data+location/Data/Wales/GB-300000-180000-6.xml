		<content>  Some 50% of the area surveyed is     
 farmland with an average farm size of 
 60 hectares.Most farms in the area are
 mixed stock or dairy farms.Cattle and 
 sheep are sold at Cowbridge or Newport
 Market and milk is sold to the Milk   
 Marketing Board.The farms are mainly  
 family run businesses and therefore   
 no more than two people,other than the
 family are employed.Most ofthe land   
 is permanent pasture with some ley    
 pasture and fodder crops.Liver fluke  
 is the most common problem in the area
 and this requires farmers to treat    
 cattle frequently.                    
    During winter months most animals  
 are kept under cover.This is a busy   
 period as calving also begins at this 
 time. Food for the winter is collected
 during spring and summer. Shearing    
 occurs in May.Wool is sold to The Wool
 Marketing Board.                      </content>
