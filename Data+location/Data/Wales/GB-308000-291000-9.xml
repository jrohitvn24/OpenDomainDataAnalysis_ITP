		<content> Every year the Evangelical church     
 holds a Baptism service in the river  
 Severn at Dolerw park.At a Baptism    
 service the candidates for Baptism    
 state that they have come to know God 
 and are prepared to witness to others.
 When you are immersed in the river it 
 means that you are cleanzed of your   
 sins and the Holy Spirit comes into   
 your life.At the service hymns were   
 sung and portions of scripture were   
 read.A chorus was sung when the people
 were immersed in the water.This year  
 seven people were baptized and before 
 being immersed some said their        
 testimony and some read their favroite
 verses from the bible.Two deacons     
 officiated at the service and the     
 candidates for baptism were assisted  
 in and out of the water by two other  
 deacons.Candidates wear white clothes 
 and it is a very moving experience.   </content>
