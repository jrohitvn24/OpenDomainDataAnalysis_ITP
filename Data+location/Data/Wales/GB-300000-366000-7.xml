		<title>07FARMING IN HENLLAN (3)</title>
		<content> Sheep are fattened and provide  wool. 
 The main breeds kept are Suffolks or  
 cross bred Welsh Mountain,Leicester   
 or Dorset.There has been a trend to   
 produce leaner lambs due to a change  
 in public demand. Some wintering of   
 sheep brought down from the Denbigh   
 Moors still takes place.              
 Fat sheep are either sold in local    
 markets at Denbigh,Ruthin and St.Asaph
 or to the Welsh Quality Lamb abbatoir 
 at Henllan.Wool is also sold locally  
 to the Wool Producers of Wales sorting
 and grading depot at Denbigh.         
 Membership of the EEC.has led to a    
 gradual change in farming with better 
 financial support from CAP.for sheep  
 output leading to an increase in their
 numbers whilst milk quotas have led to
 a decline in milk production.
