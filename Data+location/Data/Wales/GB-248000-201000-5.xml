		<title>05Local History Old Iron Works</title>
		<content> At Cwmddyche an iron blast furnace was
 built by Messrs Ingman and Givers in  
 1791.Mr Alexander Raby took over about
 1796.The coal was brought first from  
 Penyfinglawdd in carts,drawn by mules 
 but after the opening of  the Caer    
 Elms and Caerbad collieries,the       
 transport of coal improved.Some of the
 iron ore was brought in ships from    
 Lancashire and carried by rail to the 
 furnace,but most was obtained from the
 Gwendraeth Valley transported in      
 coarse sacks on the backs of mules.The
 Napoleonic wars stimulated the        
 activities of his works because       
 "so prompt are the measures of the    
 Government at this time that four     
 furnaces are at work night and day at 
 Llanelly,solely confined to the Board 
 of Ordnance."  Remains of the Old Iron
 Works can still be seen in the village
 of Furnace,named after the industry.  </content>
