		<title>05The history of Gwynfryn</title>
		<content> Gwynfryn village stands on a limestone
 ridge.It is over a thousand feet      
 above sea level.In English the        
 name Gwynfryn means White Hill. Some  
 people say that this is because of the
 colour of the limestone but others    
 think it might be because , in        
 winter, it is often white with snow.  
  Many years ago there were a large    
 number of quarries and lead mines     
 worked in the area and because people 
 came to work in them the village      
 grew.The good quality stone from the  
 quarries was used to build some of    
 Liverpool's best known buildings but  
 there is only one quarry working today
 -that's the Tarmac Roadstone Quarry.  
  There are many abandoned lead mine   
 shafts in the area and this makes it  
 dangerous for children and animals.
