		<content> With the decline of the coal industry,
 the majority of working people living 
 in the area commute to Swansea,       
 Llanelli, Carmarthen, Ammanford and   
 other larger centres of population to 
 work. The work ranges from being      
 employed in Local and National        
 Government, in Professional Services, 
 in Service Industries and in          
 factories.                            
 In the area itself there are small    
 private businesses which provide work;
 a Farmer's Co-op, two private bus     
 companies, a small private coal mine, 
 local shops and cafes and a coal      
 depot. There are also many            
 self-employed builders living in the  
 area. Local and National Government   
 also provide work for local people in 
 2 schools, a small N.H.S. Hospital, a 
 Fire Station, an Ambulance Station and
 a Job Centre.                         </content>
