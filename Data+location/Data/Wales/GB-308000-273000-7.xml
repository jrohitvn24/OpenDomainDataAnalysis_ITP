		<content>    A typical year for the Welsh,      
 Beaulah, Speckled and Half bred ewes  
 commences by feeding on good pasture  
 ready for mating in October with      
 Border and Blue Faced Leicesters or   
 Suffolf rams.Supplementary feeding    
 follows in the last six weeks of      
 pregnancy plus a copper boost to      
 protect expected lambs against        
 Swayback.Lambs arrive in the month    
 from mid March.They are drenched at   
 a month old against worms, ear marked,
 castrated, vaccinated, and tails cut. 
   July ending sees the lambs weaned   
 and fattened on good pasture,ewes go  
 to the hill.Lamb sales start soon,    
 peaking in early November. Dead weight
 averages between 14 and 17 kilos. In  
 June the ewes are sheared. The year   
 ends with dipping against Scab and    
 drenching against fluke and worm.
