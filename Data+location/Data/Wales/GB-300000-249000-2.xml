  Builth Wells is fortunate in that    
 Powys has the lowest youth            
 unemployment rate in Wales.However,   
 these figures are distorted because of
 more school leavers joining the Youth 
 Training scheme and various vocational
 courses.Even some farmers sons are    
 now going on these courses.           
  However,there are some modern        
 suburban factories in our area which  
 have had their 'ups and downs'.       
 SATELITE TV ANTENNA SYSTEMS LTD,are a 
 prosperous firm making prototype      
 satelite TV receivers.They hope to go 
 into full production in Winter 1985   
 and increase their 16 man workforce.  
  In contrast to this a furniture      
 factory(QUALICANE LTD)a few hundred   
 yards away is owned by the owner of   
 Saturn and was closed down in May 1985
 with the loss of 50 jobs.             </content>
