		<content> In the town of Rhuddlan, there are two
 schools.{Ysgol y Castell}is the local 
 primary school which in 1985 had some 
 220 pupils aged between 4 and 11 years
 of age on roll.The school also has a  
 newly opened 'nursery unit' although  
 the future of this looks increasingly 
 bleak in view of the current economic 
 climate. Pupils follow a wide ranging 
 course of education through the medium
 of English and Welsh.The school has an
 excellent sporting and music/drama    
 tradition, winning honours in both    
 fields.It is also the centre of many  
 communal activities .Money has been   
 raised within the community for the   
 purpose of establishing a new comm-   
 unity centre on another site.         
{Ysgol TirMorfa}forms part of a school 
 complex providing education for those 
 with special educational needs.
