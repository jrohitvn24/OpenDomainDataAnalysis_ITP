 Work on the castle started in 1283 and
 it was completed in 1534 but the      
 castle was never finished .The Queen's
 Gate was left unfinished on the inward
 side. It was built by Edward 1 as a   
 defence against any possible Welsh    
 uprising and as a ceremonial centre   
 for a new dynesty of English princes. 
 The castle was overrun by Madog ap    
 LLywelyn in 1295.It successfully      
 withstood sieges by Owain Glyndwr in  
 1403 and 1404.                        
 During the civil war c.1650 the castle
 was garrisoned on the kings behalf but
 was taken and retaken no less than 4  
 times before the final defeat  of the 
 kings men. Between 1880 and 1900 a    
 programme of repairs and renewals at  
 government expense was carried out by 
 sir LLywelyn Turner deputy constable.
