		<title>16Religion in Caerhun Parish</title>
		<content> The older members of the community    
 take an active part in church and     
 chapel. The young inhabitants are not 
 at all anti-religion but they feel    
 there is little there to motivate     
 them. Only a few attend services and  
 as a result there is a sharp drop in  
 membership. There is a Welsh          
 Congregational Chapel at the upper end
 of Rowen village. The building is in  
 good condition but the congregation is
 small, numbering only six. There is no
 minister in charge of the chapel and  
 there are no longer weekday meetings. 
 Members meet one Sunday each month.   
 Some residents belong to Caerhun or   
 Llangelynin churches. Salem chapel at 
 Llanbedr-y-cennin has been converted  
 into a private house.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
