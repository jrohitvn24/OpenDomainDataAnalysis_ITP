		<title>18Ewloe Interchange</title>
		<content> The Ewloe Interchange is part of the  
 Hawarden By-pass, work began in       
 february 1982 and it was opened       
 September 1984. It was built because:{
 tourist traffic jams in summer months 
 made it impossible for local people to
 go about their business. It is part of
 aroad plan which allows factories to  
 send goods quickly and easily in      
 lorries between {N.Wales, Liverpool , 
{&amp; the rest of Britain &amp; Europe }via   
 the E22 Euroroute as far as {Sussnitz 
{on the Baltic Coast.                  
{ }Lighting at Ewloe is provided by    
 high mast system 30m high. The        
 interchange has an extra 3rd lane to  
 allow traffic to enter or leave the   
 dual carriageway.The lanes were made  
 of concrete because it is cheaper. The
 2 firms involved in the building were 
 Sir Alfred McAlpine and Fairclough    
 Civil Engineering.                    </content>
