		<content>  In 1913 local coalowners started a   
 school of mines at Crumlin, north of  
 Crosskeys. In 1929 Monmouthshire      
 L.E.A. took responsibility for the    
 school, and it became the "Technical  
 College of Monmouthshire", moving to  
 its present site in 1961. In 1976 the 
 College "went tertiary", becoming the 
 sole centre for post_16 academic/     
 vocational education for students     
 leaving the six local 11_16           
 comprehensive schools.                
  In 1982 the name "Crosskeys College" 
 was adopted. The name changes reflect 
 the decline of mining in the area. The
 College enrols 1200 full_time and a   
 similar number of part_time students  
 each year, about 50%  coming from     
 outside the College's catchment area. 
 This reflects the "open_access"       
 philosophy of tertiary education. The 
 present Principal is Dr. W. Bleazard.{</content>
