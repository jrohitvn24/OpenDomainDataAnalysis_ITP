		<title>11The Llandaff Rowing Club.</title>
		<content> The Llandaff Rowing Club on the banks 
 of the river Taff was founded in 1879 
 and is the oldest in Wales. There are 
 400 members but only 60 are active    
 rowers. The boat-builder and organiser
 of the club, which shares facilities  
 with the University College of Wales, 
 Cardiff, is Mr John Essex. He is the  
 third generation of his family to have
 worked there. The rowers use 0.75 mile
 stretch of the Taff. The water is far 
 cleaner now than it was 10 yrs ago,   
 and has some fish and eels in spite of
 polution. The highest cost for a boat 
 is between Â£6,000 and Â£7,000 and the  
 oars cost Â£1,200. The club also has a 
 bar, shower room, and a weight room.  
 There is an annual regatta in July.
