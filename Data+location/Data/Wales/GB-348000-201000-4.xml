 is dominated by coniferous woodland.  
 The Forestry Commission manages the   
 ecology of Tintern, Ninewells,Creigiou
 and Broadmend woods. The main tree    
 are Sitka Spruce, Scots Pine and      
 Corsican Pine.Other species are       
 Japanese Larch, Norway Spruce, Western
 Red Cedar and Lodge Pole Pine. The    
 main planting in the area was between 
 1924 and 1954. Further planting took  
 place in 1975,'76,'81,and is still    
 going on.The soil is poor being on    
 quartz conglo_ merate.Near Cleddon Bog
 tree's are planted on mound's to help 
 drainage around the roots. Japanese   
 Larch are planted as fire breaks.In   
 1981 a grass fire at Cleddon Bog      
 scorched the Larch but spread no      
 further. Water tanks, ponds and       
 beaters are sited to fight fires.
