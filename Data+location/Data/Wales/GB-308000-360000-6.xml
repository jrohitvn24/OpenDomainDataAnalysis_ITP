		<content> Rhewl originally meant in Welsh "Yr   
 Hawl" = "The Right"; i.e. the right   
 for the Drovers of 1300-1870 approx.  
 to cross the River Clywedog at the    
 ford on their route from Ruthin to    
 Cerrig-Y-Drudion.A Public House       
 bearing the name "Drover's Arms stands
 adjacent to the ford.Old Drover's Inns
 frequently have Scots Pine growing    
 nearby, and this is no exeption, they 
 being used as a landmark over the     
 years.                                
 The railways arrived in 1860 with a   
 stop at Rhewl and continuing to Rhyl  
 which was emerging as a Holiday       
 Resort.The line fell foul of the      
 Beeching Axe in 1963.                 
 Road Transport is foremost today,the  
 A 525 being a particularly busy       
 thoroughfare,other roads being        
 relatively quiet country lanes.
