		<title>13Holiday chalets Llanddulas</title>
		<content> There are 82 chalets on a cliff-top,  
 set between the quarry and Llanddulas 
 village,near the Llanddulas Hall      
 Country club.There are also chalets on
 the beach,near the railway line.The   
 chalets are a local landmark,looking  
 like multi-coloured model houses from 
 the coast road below.They have        
 balconies,and are built on stilts     
 because of the very steep slope.The   
 chalets are made of wood,with steel   
 stilts.They are for holiday-makers'   
 rest and leisure.                     
   All the chalets have very nice      
 facilities,and people come from all   
 over the Northwest and Midlands for   
 holidays,mostly Merseyside and Man-   
 chester.The holiday-makers swell the  
 village population in summer by       
 between 500 and 1000 people,which is  
 very good for village trade,pubs and  
 shops.                                </content>
