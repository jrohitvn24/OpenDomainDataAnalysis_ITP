		<content> Most children enjoy playing ball      
 games.They all love to run about and  
 talk with their friends.Many children 
 enact television programmes they have 
 watched,instead of making up their own
 games.They seem to have lost their    
 imagination.                          
 A very popular pastime with youngsters
 is playing computer games.Computers   
 are linked up to television screens   
 and the games are fed into them       
 through cassette players or disk      
 drives.                               
 1985 was the 75th anniversary of      
 guiding.In this area there are active 
 packs of Brownies,Guides,Rangers and  
 Cubs.Many girls and boys enjoy        
 belonging to these.                   
 Older boys in this area belong to the 
 Air Training Corps or the Army Cadets.
