		<title>20LITTLE MILL W.I.</title>
		<content> Our W.I.is an active group of nearly  
 50 members who cater for the market,  
 charity events and visiting W.I.s.    
 Members visit elderly residents of a  
 local residential home when it is the 
 elderly person's birthday.We provide  
 teas every month at the local Cheshire
 Home.                                 
 Monthly meetings, where speakers give 
 an insight into a wide variety of     
 topics, are held at the village hall. 
 We also hear news from the County and 
 National Committees which organise    
 events for us.Competitions are held   
 bimonthly with the person gaining the 
 most points winning a cup at the end  
 of the year.                          
 We can give a woman's opinion about   
 impending legislation to government   
 during the bill's consultative stage  
 via the organisation so we are more   
 than just "Jam and Jerusalem".        </content>
