		<content>{CHURCHES AND CHAPELS.                 
   Within our survey area there are 6  
 churches.They are St. Elvan, St.      
 Margaret,St. Mary Magdalene,St.       
 Matthew and St. John.There is one     
 Roman Catholic church called St.      
 Joseph's.There are numerous chapels:  
 Baptist (5),Methodist (3),Presbyterian
 (4),Congregationalist (4) as well as  
 many other denominations. A school    
 survey showed less than 5% of the     
 pupils attended regularly at any place
 of worship.However, every school is   
 required by law to conduct a religious
 service every day (i.e. a Christian   
 service). This usually contains a     
 moral story, a prayer, and a hymn     
 followed by any school notices. Most  
 children find assembly boring and     
 irrelevant.
