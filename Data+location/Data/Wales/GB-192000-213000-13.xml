		<title>13Housing in Haverfordwest (2)</title>
		<content> The Council have built 4 large housing
 estates mostly of semi-detached       
 properties but with some terraced     
 houses. Recently some of these houses 
 have been sold to sitting tenants.    
 There are two estates of service      
 houses and flats, owned by the        
 Government and inhabited by servicemen
 from R.A.F. Brawdy. There is little   
 other evidence of flat or apartment   
 type dwellings except above the       
 businesses in town. There has been a  
 policy to renovate old properties with
 Government grants being issued.The old
 buildings of St. Thomas's Hospital    
 have recently been converted into     
 flats for the use of one parent and   
 homeless families. It is rare to find 
 more than one family unit living in   
 one house. Occasionally one aged      
 parent may reside with a family.
