		<title>20Mari Lwyd (Grey Mare)</title>
		<content> The Welsh ceremony of{Mari Lwyd}still 
 survives in Pencoed at Christmas      
 time.a horse's skull, decorated with  
 ribbons and glass eyes, is carried    
 around the streets on a pole by a man 
 hidden under a white shroud. It is    
 carried from door to door, snapping   
 its jaws at bystanders, and only goes 
 away on payment of a fine - and it is 
 said that those who refuse to pay are 
 sure to have bad luck.                
    The Mari used to be a familiar     
 sight in the area until about 40 years
 ago. The skull was usually accompanied
 by a variety of characters, including 
 the leader, a Sergeant, a Merryman    
 carrying a fiddle, and Pwnsh and Siwan
 (or Punch and Judy).                  
    Although the Mari was usually      
 associated with New Year's Eve, it    
 appeared in different villages at any 
 time over the Christmas period.       </content>
