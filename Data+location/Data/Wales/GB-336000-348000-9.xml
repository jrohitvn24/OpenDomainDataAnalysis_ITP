   As this is a time of economic       
 depression there is much unemployment 
 in the general area.Here it is less   
 because the scattered homes house men 
 and women who work locally.Others as  
 with many on the housing estate travel
 to different places to perform a      
 variety of tasks.Many are             
 operatives,process workers,shop       
 assistants and clerks in the various  
 manufacturing and service industries  
 in the area.Some are retired (usually 
 over 65 years of age) some are        
 unemployed unable to secure           
 employment,andsome were made redundant
 from industries unable to compete in  
 present day trading conditions.The    
 present rate of unemployment in

 working population.
