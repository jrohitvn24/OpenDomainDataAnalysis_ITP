		<content> On New years day a dark man walks     
 through the house from the back to the
 front,he carries a lump of coal.It is 
 supposed to  bring good luck.         
 It is bad luck if a black cat crosses 
 in your path.                         
 Don't open a umbrella in a house.     
 The Peacocks feather is known as the  
 devils eye.                           
 If you see a white horse,spit and it  
 brings you good luck.                 
 If the oak is out before the ash we   
 shall have a splash,and if the ash is 
 out before the oak we shall have a    
 soak.                                 
 If if rains on St.Swithins we shall   
 have rain for fourty days,and if it is
 sunny we shall have sunny weather for 
 fourty days after.                    
 Don't wear red in a field where there 
 is a Bull or he will charge at you.
