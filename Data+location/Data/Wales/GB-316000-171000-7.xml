 meadowland with a beautiful field     
 surrounding it, and has a good view of
 Penarth. When it was opened on the

 children and 8 staff. There were 3    
 Infant classes and 3 Junior classes.  
 In 1966 there was an annex built for  
 children with special learning        
 difficulties. Now in 1985 there are   
 197 children, 9 staff, a Welsh        
 teacher,remedial reading teacher and  
 secretary all of whom work part time, 
 plus 2 Nursery assistants. Our school 
 is lively and interesting, with good  
 sport and educational facilities. We  
 have a very active P.T.A. who help us 
 to buy important equipment. Every year
 we have concerts, school trips, discos
 and parties. We play netball, football
 and baseball and we won the 1984-5    
 football league trophy.               </content>
