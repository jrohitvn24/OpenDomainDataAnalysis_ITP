		<title>01THE BURTON AND NEYLAND AREA</title>
		<content>   Our area is in{Pembrokeshire}near   
 the estuary of the{River Cleddau.}It  
 is split in two by the river;on the   
 north (which is by far the biggest    
 area) is farmland apart from the small
 town of{Neyland . }On the south side  
 there are some disused oil tanks and  
 an old army barracks that have been   
 turned into offices.                  
{  Neyland}has just had a new boom in  
 its tourist attractions for a new {   
{Marina}has just been built on         
 Westfield Pill.                       
   Not many people work in{Burton}and{ 
{Burton Ferry }but they go into nearby 
 towns.Many of the men work in the{Oil 
{Refineries}at{Milford Haven.          
   We think that the people in our area
 are contented with their life style   
 and dont want it changed.
