		<title>20THE LOCAL POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> I was appointed Post Mistress of      
 Velindre in 1953. During this period  
 there have been vast changes in the   
 postal services in the area. In 1953  
 there were three part-time postmen    
 employed at this office, together with
 one full-time Royal Mail van driver,  
 who brought the mail at 7 a.m. to     
 Velindre from Llandysul to be  sorted 
 out and delivered. The three part-time
 postmen delivered on cycles. In 1973  
 this office ceased to be a delivery   
 office and all the mail is now sorted 
 at the main Post Office at Llandysul  
 and delivered  by two full-time Royal 
 Mail van drivers. This office covers a
 wide area, and includes  the hamlets  
 of Drefelin,Penboyr,Cwmpengraig,      
 Cwmhireth as well as Drefach,Velindre.
 In 1953 95% of the population spoke   
 Welsh, but today 50% of the customers 
 are English       {MRS A.DANIELS JONES</content>
