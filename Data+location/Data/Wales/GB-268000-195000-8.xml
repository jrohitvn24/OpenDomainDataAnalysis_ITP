		<content> There were three English chapels:Salem
 Apostolic,Peniel Green Congregational 
 and Lon Las Mission.These chapels had 
 three facts in common.                
 1.All were evangelical chapels.       
 2.All were well attended and had      
 growing congregations.                
 3.All were actively involved in the   
 local community,especially with       
 children and young people.            
 There was one church,St Samlet Parish 
 Church.This was also quite well       
 attended and the clergy often visited 
 local schools to take services in     
 assembly.                             
 We held a survey in school to find out
 how many children and adults attended 
 church.                               
 Children attending Sunday School=15%  
 Children attending Sunday services=7% 
 Parents attending Sunday services=7%  
 Parents attending services in week=5% </content>
