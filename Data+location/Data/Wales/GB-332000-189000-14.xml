		<title>14One Day of my life</title>
		<content> By Simon Goodwin Age 7                
 On a tuesday I get up from my bed     
 early because Adam jumps on me so I   
 get up and go downstairs and turn the 
 television on and I fall asleep on the
 chair. When I wake up I make breakfast
 and get dressed and make a cup of tea 
 for Mum and Dad and then when it is   
 time for school I get my coat on and  
 get in to the car at ten to nine. When
 I get in the playground I can never   
 stop running because I get the        
 reception after me. When we go in I   
 take my coat off and get the pens and 
 green book and give them to Mrs       
 Thomas. Then we have the register and 
 we talk about what we are writing     
 about. Then someone changes the chart 
 and I listen to what I have to do     
 Then when I have done about one and a 
 half jobs the asssembly bell goes.    
 Then we line up for assembly          </content>
