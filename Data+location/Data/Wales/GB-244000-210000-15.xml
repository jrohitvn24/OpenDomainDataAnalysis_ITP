		<content>      There are two 'B' roads running  
 through this area and both have a bus 
 service.  Three services run daily,   
 except Sundays, on the B4306 route    
 Pontyberem-Carmarthen, but there are  
 eleven buses, on the B4309 route      
 daily, except Sundays,                
 Pontyates-Carmarthen.                 
      The majority of the population   
 live on farms and have some means of  
 private transport e.g. car, van,      
 landrover.                            
      The nearest railway station is at
 Carmarthen, which is a market town.   
 Trains travel to Fishguard or as far  
 as London from this station.          
      Only cars are suitable on most of
 the minor roads because they are so   
 narrow.  Tractors and other large     
 vehicles are too wide and churn up the
 hedge banks making roads muddy.
