		<content> 54 people are employed at the Health  
 Centre including doctors, nurses,     
 receptionists, secretaries, health    
 visitors and cleaning staff.          
    Surgeries are held in the morning  
 and afternoon and doctors visit some  
 patients at home. There is always a   
 doctor on call when the centre is     
 closed.                               
    Clinics are held for chiropody,    
 audiology, speech therapy and obesity.
 There are also ante natal clinics and 
 relaxation classes. There are visiting
 dentists and opticians to treat       
 children under sixteen.               
    Social workers, psychiatric nurses,
 a clinical psychologist and marriage  
 guidance councillors visit once a     
 week. In the evenings the centre is   
 used by St. John's Ambulance and the  
 Family Planning Clinic.
