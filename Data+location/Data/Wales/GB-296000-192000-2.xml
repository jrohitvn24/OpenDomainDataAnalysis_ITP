		<title>02TYPICAL HOUSING OF AREA</title>
		<content>     In 1860, Archibald Hood came from 
 Scotland to the Rhondda and sunk the  
 Glamorgan Collieries.  Men came from  
 all over to work in the mines and Hood
 , being a fair master, had to quickly 
 build rows of terraced houses for his 
 workers. They were first built from   
 local stone and later brick, made in  
 the local Scotch(Glamorgan) Colliery. 
 These terraces are unique in the      
 Rhondda. The front of the houses      
 overlook large gardens purposely made 
 for the people to be self-sufficient. 
 They have, however, no front entrances
 The main entrance to the houses is at 
 the back of the house.                
    Today most of the people of        
 Llwynypia still live in these terraces
 The old toilets which were opposite   
 the back of the house have been made  
 into car ports. This is because the   
 lanes are far too narrow to park cars.</content>
