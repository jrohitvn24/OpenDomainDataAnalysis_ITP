		<title>10COEDELY KENNELS-TONYREFAIL</title>
		<content> The kennels are situated just outside 
 Coedely on top of a hill.The National 
 Canine Defence League own the kennels 
 but Mrs Roberts looks after the dogs  
 with the help of another girl.        
   The dogs have often been badly      
 treated or abandoned.People bring in  
 stray dogs they feed them and try to  
 find homes for them. "Lucky" my dog   
 was found in a plastic bag floating   
 down the river.A man found him and    
 took him to Mrs Roberts.They phoned   
 my mother and told her to come up     
 the kennels.When I came home from     
 school I went to pick him up.         
  They raise money by taking the dogs  
 on sponsored walks or by selling      
 Christmas cards. They sometimes have  
 dog shows for the dogs with the       
 waggiest tail or ones with the        
 prettiest face.
