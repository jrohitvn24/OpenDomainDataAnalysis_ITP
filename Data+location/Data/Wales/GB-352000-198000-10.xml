		<title>10TINTERN STATION</title>
		<content>  Tintern Station,situated between the 
 main Chepstow to Monmouth road (A466) 
 and the River Wye,about a quarter of a
 mile north of Tintern,is a reminder of
 the days of steam engines which ran   
 between Chepstow and Monmouth,the old 
 Wye Valley line.The line was single   
 track the only passing place being at 
 Tintern.                              
  Its present function is as a Wye     
 Valley Railway museum where there are 
 many photographs and artefacts,one of 
 the most important being the token    
 which had to be carried from one      
 station to the next,its presence at a 
 station showing the line was clear.   
  The signal box has been preserved    
 together with the signals.The waiting 
 room and ticket office now display    
 models of steam engines and provide a 
 refreshment area and outside a picnic 
 area.                                 </content>
