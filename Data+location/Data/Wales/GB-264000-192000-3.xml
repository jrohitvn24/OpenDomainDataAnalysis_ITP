 Riflemans Row and Taplow Terrace are  
 two rows of small terraced houses     
 which date from the mid-nineteenth    
 century.  They were buiit by local    
 industrialists for men who worked in  
 their metal works.  Many of them have 
 been modernised.                      
 Gwyndy Road is made up of             
 semi-detatched council houses which   
 are traditional in design.  These     
 houses were built about 30 years ago. 
 During the last 10 years many new     
 council houses have been built to a   
 more modern design.                   
 These newest houses have been built   
 where there were once{'prefabs'.} The 
 'prefabs' were built after the Second 
 World War as a quick way of providing 
 homes for all the people who had been 
 bombed out.                           </content>
