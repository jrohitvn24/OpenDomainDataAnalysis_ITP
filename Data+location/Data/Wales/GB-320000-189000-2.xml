		<content> A major event in 1985 is the building 
 of the new by-pass(seeTransport).Where
 it crosses the Ebbw at Crosskeys an   
 underpass follows the river bank and  
 the walls of this under-pass bear a   
 mosaic mural depicting Crosskeys'life 
 in the 1920's and 1985.(Photo"B").The 
 mural shows a famous street corner,a  
 marching band, a Whitsun tea-party, a 
 rugby match and a Baptist "Band of    
 Hope".The foreground shows an Italian 
 ice-cream seller,typical of the       
 valleys.Opposite is a scene from the  
 mining world with a retired miner, Mr.
 Clarke,portrayed in 1985 mining gear. 
 The mural,commissioned by Gwent       
 County Council was made by Mr.Kenneth 
 Budd and his son Oliver of Kent.They  
 have designed other murals in         
 S.Wales(in Newport &amp; Caerleon)as well 
 as on Birmingham's inner ring road.
