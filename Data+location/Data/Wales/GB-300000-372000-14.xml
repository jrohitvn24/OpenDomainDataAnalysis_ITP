		<content> 65% OF THE PEOPLE INTERVIEWED HAD     
 LIVED IN ST.ASAPH FOR MORE THAN 10    
 YEARS.                                
 THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WERE ATTRACTED 
 TO ST.ASAPH BECAUSE IT WAS  QUIET AND 
 NEAR THE SHOPS BUT AWAY FROM THE      
 NOISEY TOWNS.                         
   ONLY 10% OF THE PEOPLE INTERVIEWED  
 COULD SPEAK WELSH.                    
   ALL OF THE INTERVIEWED PEOPLE USED  
 LOCAL SHOPS, SOME DEPENDING ON THEM   
 AND OTHERS JUST TO BUY ODD THINGS.
