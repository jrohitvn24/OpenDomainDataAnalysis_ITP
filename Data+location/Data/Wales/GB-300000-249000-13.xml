		<title>13BUILTH (W): RELIGION</title>
		<content>  Builth (W) serves as the religious   
 centre of the surrounding area.St.    
 Mary's Parish Church is part of the   
 Church of Wales in the diocese of     
 Swansea and Brecon.The church tower is
 14th century,but the rest of the      
 church was rebuilt in 1875.The        
 Reverend Elwyn John is the vicar.     
   A number of nonconformist churches  
 surround the parish church : Horeb    
 United Reform Church Wesleyan         
 Methodist Church,Memorial Baptist     
 Church and just out side the D-block, 
 Alpha Calvinistic Methodist           
 Church.These churches generally have  
 congregations of ten to twenty and    
 share a minister with other           
 churches.Further west but still in    
 Builth (W) there is the Roman         
 Catholic Church.This is a very  lively
 church at the moment,attracting quite 
 a large congregation,of all ages.     </content>
