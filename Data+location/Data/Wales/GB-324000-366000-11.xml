		<title>11RELIGION THE GRAVEYARD</title>
		<content> A study of a graveyard can reveal some
 very interesting facts.In Northop     
 there is quite a large graveyard and  
 one of the activities we carried out  
 was an examination of it.The oldest   
 was dated 1832 and the most recent was
 1985, with over 400 graves in total.  
 There were also 3 family plots which  
 housed multiple burials.The youngest  
 person named on a gravestone was a    
 certain Mary-Anne Jones who died on   
 May 27th 1873,. aged 10 months. We    
 noticed that there were many graves of
 servicemen who had died during The    
 Great War of 1914-1918 and there was  
 also a grave of a Belgian refugee.    
 One sign of our times is that like the
 church, the graveyard was always under
 close scrutiny as damage had been     
 caused quite recently.It was sad to   
 see that some gravestones were in bad 
 repair.Much work is needed.           </content>
