		<content>      Blackwood, as the district's     
 focal point, hosts the main           
 entertainment. It has a cinema which  
 opens daily. It's operatic society has
 two or three productions a year whilst
 the dramatic society has a four placed
 season. Both of international class,  
 practice at Cefn Fforest and Libanus  
 respectively. Outside this, popular   
 enterainment is provided by working   
 men's clubs. On the organised side is 
 a general conformity of presentation. 
 The weekend is invariably set aside   
 for dancing, bingo and the "concert". 
 This might take the form of resident  
 artists singing or playing and a      
 general sing-along. Occasionally a    
 professional artist is engaged. Week  
 days see skittles, pool and cards take
 place competitivley. The clubs always 
 provide Christmas parties and Summer  
 outings for members children.         </content>
