		<content> After the interviews had been         
 conducted the children came to the    
 following conclusions.                
 I think the park is an ideal place for
 a{walk}or a{picnic.}It is the ideal   
 place for older people but it does not
 cater enough for teenagers. It needs a
 small{swimming pool}or a more         
 elaborate{adventure playground.}I also
 think the{adventure playground}should 
 be moved from its present position to 
 the grass area in front of the        
 outbuildings wherethe ground is safer 
 if a child fell. It would be safer as 
 well if it was away from the lake as  
 young children have a tendancy to     
 wander.                               
 Also there are not any toilet         
 facilities for disabled people and the
 cafe has steps leading to it which can
 cause great difficulty for those in   
 wheelchairs.                          </content>
