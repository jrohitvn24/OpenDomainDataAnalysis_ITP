		<content> When Mr.Ashley Davies was a boy in    
 1930 there were 42 houses in Lamphey. 
 Cottages were small with 3 or 4 rooms.
 There were no bathrooms or indoor     
 toilets.Some families had many        
 children.To save space beds folded    
 into cupboards in daytime.One bed     
 could sleep four children,two at the  
 top and two at the bottom.Furniture   
 was plain and made of wood.Food was   
 cooked over the kitchen fire.A few    
 houses had a coal fired range.Water   
 had to be collected each day from the 
 village pump.The coal was bagged at   
 the railway station and taken to the  
 houses on trucks.The coal dust was    
 mixed with wet clay or slime and made 
 into balls to burn on the fire.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
