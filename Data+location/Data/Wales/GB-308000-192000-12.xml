		<title>12The media in Abercynon</title>
		<content> Our Domesday Block is covered by a    
 number of local newspapers.           
 The two most popular are THE MOUNTAIN 
 ASH LEADER, which is the one most read
 in Abercynon the largest town, and the
 PONTYPRIDD OBSERVER. THE LEADER sells 
 between 3,000 and 4,000 copies a week 
 and has been in print since the late  
 1960's. Before that date, the ABERDARE
 LEADER covered the area from 1902.    
 There are four paid reporters and a   
 photographer as well as local         
 correspodents. About 15 to 20 letters 
 are sent to THE LEADER each week,many 
 about local and national POLITICS.    
 Over the last year, the most important
 story has been the{miners strike.}Even
 though  the strike has been over for  
 some months, letters are still being  
 written about the cost to the country 
 of providing free meals for the       
 children of striking miners.          </content>
