		<title>11Thoughts on Presteigne</title>
		<content>     Presteigne is far away from any   
 really big towns and it is hard to get
 to them.Knighton is the nearest town. 
 It is hard to drive down the main     
 street of Presteigne because of the   
 cars parked there,more{car parks}are  
 needed.I also think that Presteigne   
 should be left alone because it is    
 being spoilt by lots of adventurous   
 ideas.It is a little{rural town}and it
 should stay that way.There should also
 be more{public footpath.}Presteigne is
 a lovely place to walk around if only 
 you could without being shouted at by 
 a farmer.                             
     The town has plenty of{shops}and  
 the jams on the High Street have been 
 relieved by the{new by-pass.} I don't 
 think there could be anywhere more    
{peaceful}than Presteigne.
