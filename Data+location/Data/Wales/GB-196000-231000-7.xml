 THESE ARE FEW.                        
 FOR ADULTS, THERE ARE TWO LICENSED    
 CLUBS.                                
 ONE IS RUN BY THE M.O.D. POLICE AND IS
 GENERALLY USED FOR DANCING, PARTIERS  
 AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT CAN INCLUDE 
 CHILDREN, SINCE THE BAR IS TOTALLY    
 SEPARATE. NOT OPEN EVERY NIGHT.       
 THE OTHER CLUB IS RUN BY ITS OWN      
 COMMITTEE AND PROVIDES DRINKINH       
 FACILITIES EVERY NIGHT OF THE YEAR.   
 THIS CLUB ALSO PROVIDES BINGO,        
 SKITTLES AND OTHER PUB PURSUITS, AND  
 IS OPEN TO BOTH SEXES.                
 OUTDOOR FACILITIES FOR CHILDREN ARE   
 LIMITED TO ONE SMALL FOOTBALL FIELD
