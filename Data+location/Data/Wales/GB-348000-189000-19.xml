		<content>   Whilst we have been working on the  
 Domesday Project, a number of local   
 issues have been in the national      
 headlines:                            
                                       
 1.  Is there a need for a second      
 Severn crossing?  The Severn Bridge is
 constantly in need of repairs, and    
 frequently causes traffic congestion. 
                                       
 2.  There has been an increase in the 
 toll for crossing the Severn Bridge,  
 and the new charge of 50p for cars has
 caused much controversy.              
                                       
 3.  Should there be a Severn barrage  
 to generate electricity from the      
 strong tides in the estuary?  If one  
 is built, could it be combined with a 
 road crossing of the river?           
                                       
                                       </content>
