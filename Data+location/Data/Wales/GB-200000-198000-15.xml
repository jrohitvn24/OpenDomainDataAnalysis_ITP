		<content> Although there are a number of doctors
 living in Lamphey there is no surgery 
 in the village or in any of ther other
 villages in the block.The nearest     
 surgery is in Pembroke some two miles 
 away,there area also surgeries in     
 Tenby and Saudersfoot.There is a small
 cottage hospital with limited         
 facilities in Pembroke Dock,this is   
 staffed by the local G.P.s.For more   
 extensive facilities the residents    
 have to travel to Haverfordwest some  
 ten miles away.The most disturbing    
 aspect is that for children requiring 
 E.N.T. treatment the nearest treatment
 available is in Carmarthen some thirty
 miles away.The nearest ambulance      
 station is in Pembroke Dock,three     
 miles away.Dentistry is also to be    
 found in Pembroke whilst the clinics  
 are in Pembroke and Pembroke Dock.
