		<title>18Changes In The Village</title>
		<content> There have been many changes in the   
 village since the turn of the century.
    The work on building the council   
 housing estate was started before 1916
 and continued for several years.      
    During the Second World War, a     
 large site of temporary hostal        
 accomadation was built on the         
 outskirts of the village to house some
 of the workers from the arsenal at    
 Bridgend. This site had disappeared by
 the mid 1950's.                       
    Perhaps the most important change  
 to affect the village was the building
 of the M4 motorway link between       
 Cardiff and Sarn Park. This has       
 allowed people to travel further      
 afield to work, and the population of 
 the village has increased.
