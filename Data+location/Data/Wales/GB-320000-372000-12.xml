		<title>12My Diet</title>
		<content> The sort of foods I like to eat are   
 chips, salads and Chinese food. At    
 home we eat lots of fried things like 
 beefburgers, bacon and sausages. When 
 we are out shopping we often go to a  
 fast food restaurant like MacDonalds  
 or Wimpys. At these places we buy     
 burgers, chips, pie and coffee or tea.
 Sometimes we drink cola or milkshake. 
                                       
 Many of the things we eat at home are 
 packaged, things like fish fingers or 
 baked beans. On Sunday we have a big  
 family lunch of roast meat, potatoes  
 (sometimes roast and boiled) and two  
 vegetables with gravey. If we have    
 beef we also have Yorkshire Puddings. 
 This is my father's favourite meal,   
 but I prefer burgers or a Chinese meal
 from the local fish and chip shop.
