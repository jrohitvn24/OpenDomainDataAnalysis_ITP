		<title>13PORTHCAWL-Pedestrianisation</title>
		<content> In 1985 the Ogwr Borough Council      
 organised a local project with the    
 schools in Porthcawl. They intend to  
 pedestrianise the main shopping centre
 and asked the schools to design ideas 
 that they felt would be suitable for a
 precinct.The schools came up with some
 excellent suggestions and all involved
 worked extremely hard.On 8th July 1985
 all the models and maps were displayed
 for the public in the main hall of the
 Grand Pavilion.We learned a lot about 
 our town and about Town and Country   
 Planning in our area.Eventually when  
 the Borough Council do pedestrianise  
 the centre we,the children of         
 Porthcawl,will be eagerly awaiting the
 features of the new precinct,wondering
 what part of our project,if any,will  
 be used.
