		<title>16Tuesday with Nicola</title>
		<content> On Tuesday I get up at about 7.50am. I
 have Rice Krispies and a cup of tea. I
 watch TV-am for about 15 minutes. At  
 about 8.20am I get ready for school.  
 Then,at about 8.30am,I go to let my   
 one duck and my nine chickens out.    
 After that I come back from the       
 chicken pen and put my coat on.At     
 8.50am I set out for school.My mother 
 takes me in the car because I live    
 quite a long way from the school.     
 School starts at 9.00am. At 9.05am we 
 go into assembly where we sing Welsh  
 hymns.During the morning we do Maths, 
 PE,English and we go out to play      
 rounders.At 12 noon we go home for    
 lunch.At 1.30pm we come back to       
 school.Then we do sewing,singing      
 together and reading cards.At 4.00pm  
 we go home.
