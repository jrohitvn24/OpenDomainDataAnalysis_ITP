		<title>12Margam Park. Kitchen Garden</title>
		<content> The site of the former village of     
 Margam demolished in the 1840's and   
 latterly a Kitchen Garden.  It now    
 forms part of the formal gardens.     
 Recent excavations revealed the drains
 and part of the Guest House of the    
 former Abbey and the forecourt of the 
 Village Inn.                          
 Here are the vine and propagating     
 house, Pinetum and Garden Museum.  A  
 maze covering one acre and containg   
 3,250 conifers was completed in the   
 winter of 1982 but the trees are of   
 insufficient height for it to be      
 opened to the public.  An amphitheatre
 for open air concerts has also been   
 constructed.
