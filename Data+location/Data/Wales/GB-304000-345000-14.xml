		<content> One tavern is now a thriving garage,  
 and with the break up of the large    
 estates, rows of cottages were built  
 in the village itself.In{1880}the     
 local wealthy families renovated the  
 church and built the tower, the spire 
 was added later in memory of a son    
 killed in the War.                    
 Since the two World Wars the large    
 landowners have lost their influence  
 over the village and major facilities 
 such as the Village Hall and Sports   
 field are provided by the community.  
 Marched across by{Llewellyn, Glyndwr  
 and{Cromwell,}the village has         
 maintained its independant character  
 and is mainly welsh-speaking. Over the
 centuries houses have been build,     
 repaired and improved but never       
 abandoned, and it remains a           
 self-supporting independant community.
