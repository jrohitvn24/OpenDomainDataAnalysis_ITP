 people who speak welsh fluently.We are
 taught welsh as one of our subjets in 
 school.We gave out some questionaries 
 and asked Do you speak welsh? the     
 reply was out of 100 only 5 could     
 speak welsh.We entertain the school on
 S.t Davids Day by singing,danceing and
 playing music and by telling poems.We 
 have two colours in our school. One is
  Blue it stands for Cwic the other is
