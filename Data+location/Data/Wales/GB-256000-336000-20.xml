		<content> Porthmeirion village,facing south over
 the Dwyryd estuary from a wooded      
 peninsula,was developed by the        
 architect{Sir Clough Williams Ellis.  
 Starting in the 1920s,he built here a 
 holiday village in whimsical Italian  
 style,very different from the grey    
 stone houses native to this area.     
 Instead the buildings here are painted
 in gay colours_pink,blue,ochre and    
 turquoise.In the centre of the village
 is an elegant stone piazza with a pool
 Sir Clough designed some of the       
 buildings himself,others such as the  
 colonnade were rescued from demolition
 and rebuilt here.The main hotel,      
 converted from a 19th century house,  
 was destroyed by fire in 1981 but is  
 now being restored.The woods nearby   
 are also being given attention after  
 years of neglect.They contain many    
 fine rhododendrons and azaleas.       </content>
