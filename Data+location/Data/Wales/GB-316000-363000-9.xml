		<content> Sheep: About 370 Welsh Half-Bred      
 breeding ewes are kept.These are mated
 with Suffolk rams in the autumn and   
 the lambs are born in March.The sheep 
 are brought down from the higher      
 ground to the farm to avoid the worst 
 of the winter weather and are kept    
 inside for lambing. The sheep are     
 housed in groups in semi-open sheds,  
 but the ewes are placed in individual 
 pens for the birth of the lambs.Since 
 many have twins,500 lambs may be born.
 The ewes and their lambs are allowed  
 outside after the first day or two. In
 mid-April most of the sheep and lambs 
 are returned to the higher land. About
 80 ewes and their lambs may be kept on
 better grazing nearer the farm: these 
 lambs are fattened more quickly for   
 earlier sale. The remaining lambs are 
 weaned by mid-August and sold         
 throughout the autumn.                </content>
