		<title>02VICTORIAN WEEK</title>
		<content>   Every year in Llandrindod Wells     
 there is a Victorian week.It started  
 in 1982 because Llandrindod Wells used
 to be a Victorian town.To open the    
 week we have a festival opening.All   
 through the week people are able to   
 ride in a horse-drawn carriage.Most   
 people dress up in victorian costume  
 during the week and the children are  
 allowed to wear their costumes to     
 school.At the Holy Trinity Church     
 there is an exhibition of victorian   
 Reformers.The shop owners decorate    
 their shop windows as if they were    
 Victorian shops.In Middleton St there 
 is a street party for children.At the 
 end of the week there is a torchlight 
 procession where everyone carries a   
 torch.The procession goes around all  
 the hotels and then to the lake for a 
 firework display.                     
                                       </content>
