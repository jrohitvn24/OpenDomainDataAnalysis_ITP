		<title>20Dagoes, Work</title>
		<content> Local people called these squatters   
 "Dagoes".Every so often the police    
 warned the squatters that their shacks
 would be burnt down for fear of       
 disease.After a week they would return
 and rebuild them.                     
                                       
               WORK                    
 There were three bakeries.My parents  
 owned the one in Ashfield road.Bread  
 had to be fresh for the boxes of the  
 miners who worked at the Celynen North
 ,South and Navigation pit at Crumlin  
 and for those who worked at the mining
 levels at Treowen and Penar.There used
 is be a slaughter house in Riverside  
 terrace (now a garage),where pigs,    
 sheep+cows were slaughtered and the   
 freshmeat was then delivered to       
 butchers shops in the area....        
 THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN     
 NEWBRIDGE THEN AND NOW.........       </content>
