		<content> We live in a part of Wales where the  
 language spoken is mainly Welsh. The  
 school is a bilingual one and every   
 child whether Welsh or English leaves 
 the school at eleven able to speak    
 both languages.All the shopkeepers    
 speak Welsh and this helps to preserve
 the language in the area.             
 Over the past 10-15 years many English
 families have moved inti the area     
 either to work at the University at   
 Aberystwyth or at the Welsh Plant     
 Breeding Station at Bow Street, others
 have bought smallholdingsand have     
 turned to farming.Thus there has been 
 a decline in the number of Welsh      
 speakers in the area. Welsh Learner   
 classes for adults have been          
 established and are very popular and  
 this helps to keep and preserve the   
 Welshness of Talybont the and the     
 surrounding area.                     </content>
