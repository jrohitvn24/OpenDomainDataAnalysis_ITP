{Swansea is lucky to have two theatres.
 The oldest is the{Grand Theatre}which 
 is owned by the council.  As part of  
 urban renewal Â£5,000,000 has just been
 spent on improving the facilities.    
 Events in the Grand include plays on  
 their pre-London run, ballet, opera   
 and music hall.  Some people would    
 like to rename the Grand as a         
 memorial to the late{Richard Burton.  
 In 1979 the{Swansea Little Theatre    
 bought a car saleroom to convert into 
 a permanent home for them.  This      
 theatre is in Gloucester Place near   
 the new marina.  Much of the          
 conversion has been done by members   
 themselves and they produce plays     
 about six times a year.  They named   
 their theatre after{Dylan Thomas}the  
 famous Swansea poet and playwright.
