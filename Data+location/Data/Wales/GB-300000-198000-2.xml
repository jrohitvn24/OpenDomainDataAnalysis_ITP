		<title>02Ecology: Mid Cynon Valley</title>
		<content> Building is restricted to the lower   
 valley sides, leaving the upper       
 stretches of the valley covered in    
 moorland and heath (Calluna, Mollinia,
 Nardus).  Soils such as (podzols) are 
 common. Much of the original deciduous
 woodland has been removed either for  
 use as fuel or pit props, and remnants
 of this ecosystem are scattered.  The 
 Forestry Commission has planted trees 
 in several areas.  Some natural       
 marshland can be found on the         
 flood-plain of the Cynon.  The climate
 and weather are typical for this part 
 of Wales.  Rainfall is orographic and 
 frequently associated with Tropical   
 Maritime air masses, rainfall is      
 heaviest in autumn and winter.  April 
 is usually the driest month.          
 Pollution of the valley from the      
 emissions of the Phurnacite affect    
 soils and plants.                     </content>
