		<title>10     MELIDEN CHURCH</title>
		<content> There is little doubt that a church   
 has existed on its present site from  
 the earliest times.The earliest known 
 record is contained in the{Domesday   
{Book A.D. 1086}.The church is situated
 at a natural focal point in the       
 surrounding district,and is the only  
 church in Wales dedicated to{St. Melyd
 who came to Britain in{601,}became    
{first Bishop}of{London}in {604}and    
{Archbishop}of{Canterbury 619}.The chu-
 rch recorded in{Domesday}would almost 
 certainly have been of timber.The pre-
 sent stone structure has parts dating 
 from{13.C.,14.C.,15.C.}The rectangular
 plan is typical of many churches built
 in Wales during that period.The long  
 narrow nave ends in the square-ended  
 chancel,with a porch on the south     
 side.Major restoration was carried out
 in{1885}.Today the church is an       
 important centre for village life.    </content>
