		<content> The name of the village means little  
 church and the church is dedicated to 
 St. Martin. The date of the first     
 church is unknown but the first       
 vicar's name was David (1537).Church  
 records from 1605 tell an interesting 
 story about the village. The present  
 building dates from 1837. The Wesleyan
 Methodist church was built in the 19th
 century. Local Baptists were attending
 meetings in a nearby village two      
 hundred years ago but the local chapel
 was built in 1878. The Calvinistic    
 Methodist chapels at each end of the  
 village were built in 1884 and boast  
 the largest congregations. There has  
 been a steady decline in church and   
 chapel attendance since 1945, but     
 fifty years ago worship and Sunday    
 School teaching in Welsh saved the    
 language from extinction. Declining   
 attendance now threatens the language.</content>
