		<content>  United World Colleges offer students 
 of all races and religions the        
 opportunity of developing             
 international understanding by        
 providing a programme for which the   
 students need high academic           
 qualifications and a sense of         
 adventure and social responsibility.  
 Atlantic College is the first of many 
 United World Colleges.There are six   
 altogether.These are situated at New  
 Mexico,Trieste,Vancouver Island,      
 Swaziland,St.Donats and Singapore.    
  The idea behind these colleges came  
 from Dr.Kurt Hahn and others who      
 thought that the enormous loss of     
 young life in two world wars was      
 tragic.Their idea was to start a      
 school for young people of all        
 countries to attend,to learn to live  
 together in peace and to take these   
 ideas back to their own countries.    </content>
