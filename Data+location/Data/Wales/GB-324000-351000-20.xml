		<title>20Nant-y-Ffrith Hall</title>
		<content> Bwlchgwyn had one large hall called   
 Nant-y-Ffrith Hall. It was built in   
 the 1820's by a Mr.Fry a tea-merchant 
 from Liverpool. He died shortly after 
 the Hall was completed. It was then   
 bought by another tea-merchant, a Mr. 
 Peak from London. At this time the    
 Hall was used as a rural residence.   
 However in about 1833 Mr.R.V. Kyrke   
 bought the Hall. He was a descendant  
 of a Richard Kirk, who founded the    
 Bwlchgwyn Mines. The Hall then changed
 from being a country retreat to being 
 a place which was lived-in, and the   
 place where a man who depended on his 
 locality had his headquarters. Perhaps
 the attraction of the Hall lay in its 
 price as it had been sold cheaply, or 
 in the fact that it was in an area of 
 great natural beauty. The Hall has two
 cottages, a gardener's cottage and a  
 laundry cottage, still standing.      </content>
