		<title>10THE YEW TREE GARDEN,LYDART</title>
		<content> The garden of one hectare has been    
 developed since 1955,although some    
 trees are clearly much older. The     
 actual 'yew tree' is very old,and is  
 now reduced to a leafy globe which,   
 with a wintry cap of snow,looks like  
 a traditional Christmas pudding.      
 The acid soil is ideal for heathers,  
 rhododendrons and ericaceous plants.  
 The garden has a great variety of     
 maturing rare,unusual trees and shrubs
 as well as choice plants in beds,stone
 troughs and rockeries.                
 From the depths of winter with witch- 
 hazel and hellebores in flower,there  
 is a constant succession of flowers   
 and foliage changes until the waning  
 days of autumn produce brilliant      
 colour in maples and mountain ashes.  
 Indeed,the Yew Tree is a garden for   
 all seasons,and every year brings dis-
 appointments,successes and surprises. </content>
