		<title>16ST. JOSEPH'S SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>  St. Joseph's Roman Catholic School   
 Sully Road, was built as a replacement
 school in 1970. The new school was    
 officially opened on May 18th. 1970.  
 It was planned for a total of 270     
 children, but this figure was soon    
 passed and in a very short time the   
 numbers reached 320. Today there are  
 230 pupils on roll, with Mr. Lane as  
 Headteacher and nine class teachers.  
   The original St. Joseph's was built 
 in the town centre as a combined      
 school and church in 1878 and was     
 consecrated to St. Joseph by Bishop   
 Hedley. By 1881 there were 68 pupils  
 and Miss Hart was the only            
 certificated teacher.                 
   As numbers increased, other         
 buildings in the town were used as    
 classrooms. There was a class in the  
 Church Hall and two infant classes in 
 Bute Lane School.                     </content>
