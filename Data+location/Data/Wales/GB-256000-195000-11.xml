		<content> Congregations in the Welsh            
 Nonconformist Chapels have diminished 
 in latter years.Tabernacl,the Welsh   
 Independant chapel in Gowerton shares 
 a minister with 2 Swansea chapels;    
 Bethania and Bethel have no minister  
 at all.One united Sunday School is    
 held for these three chapels.Although 
 this is true for the Loughor area too,
 the future might be brighter with the 
 new generation of Welsh speakers.A    
 Gymanfa Undebol-A Festival of Praises 
 is held annually.                     
    Loughor became famous at the       
 beginning of this century with Evan   
 Roberts beginning his ministry at     
 Moriah chapel in 1904.Such was the    
 effect of his preaching,over 32,000   
 people joined the churches by the end 
 of that year.The social effects were  
 many,drunkards and theives mended     
 their ways,families were happy again. </content>
