		<title>01Llansilin - Cynllaith Valley</title>
		<content> The area covers a beautiful Welsh     
 border valley with undulating valley  
 floor 145m and steeply rising ridges  
 Pentre Cyn on SE 317  "Coed Cochion" -
 the Red Wood - E - 362m and           
 Bryn-ellyll NW 412. The Eastern slopes
 are partly covered in trees -         
 deciduous and fir woods but the main  
 crop is intensively farmed grass. Only
 3 dairy farms, the rest beef and sheep
 mainly for suckler store cattle and   
 fat or store lambs. The N part of the 
 village of Llansilin has a            
 preservation order on it - there are  
 no outstanding buildings just a street
 of houses all different but nearly all
 joined up and a beautiful church, very
 old. SE of Llansilin barley and wheat 
 grow well and one "small farm" in the 
 area rear thousands of pheasants and  
 partridges. There are miles of        
 hedgerows and wild life flourishes.   </content>
