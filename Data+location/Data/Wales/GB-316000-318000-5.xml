		<content> The National school was opened AD     
 1832.It's by the main road to         
 LLanfyllin and LLansantffraid.It had  
 got two class rooms and a cloak       
 room.Itis stone built.It closed down  
 in 1951.The stove used to smoke.It    
 would be cold for the children,       
 because the teacher would be by it all
 the while.In 1928 they had bucket     
 toilets which were modern in those    
 days.Dr Evans from the Mount was      
 Father Christmas giving out           
 presents.His beard caught fire.He had 
 severe burns to his face and          
 hands.This happened in 1930.
