 Children are generally encouraged to  
 go to a place of worship, to Guides,  
 Scouts or other youth group, music or 
 dancing lessons and to take part in   
 sport. Parents support their          
 children's activities and provide     
 transport. Adults also have outside   
 interests - sport, council work,      
 voluntary organisations - often       
 raising money for charity. They attend
 evening classes in many subjects. Many
 homes have central heating, automatic 
 washing and drying machines, fridges, 
 freezers and microwave ovens. Cooking 
 and heating is by electricity, gas,
