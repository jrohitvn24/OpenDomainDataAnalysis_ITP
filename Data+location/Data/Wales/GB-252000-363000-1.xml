		<content> This lowland region north west of     
 Caernarfon is mainly used for the     
 rearing of cattle and sheep.          
 Ocassionally, kale or potatoes are    
 grown. There is one coniferous        
 plantation. Most fields are divided by
 dry stone walls and netting fences.   
 The two straggling villages have new  
 private housing estates in them now   
 for people employed in Caernarfon     
 which is also used as their shopping  
 area. The River Seront which flows    
 from south east to north west has a   
 wide valley floor which floods        
 seriously each winter.
