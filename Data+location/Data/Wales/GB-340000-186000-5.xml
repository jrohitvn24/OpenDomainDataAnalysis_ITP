		<title>05History Procurators House</title>
		<content>  The Procurators house in Magor is one
 of only two known examples in         
 Britain,the other being Chesterton    
 Towers near Cambridge.                
  When Gilbert Marshall,Earl of        
 Pembroke and Lord of Chepstow bestowed
 the church of Magor and its income    
 upon the abbot and Convent of Santa   
 Maria Di Gloria in Central Italy in   
 1238, the abbey appointed a           
 procurator,a certain Deodatus,to act  
 in the capacity of agent or steward   
 for the Monastery,collecting the rents
 and other dues of the church of       
  Magor,including tythes,and           
 transferring the profits to Anagni in 
 Italy.As a centre for his work,the    
 procurator built himself a fine house,
 and even today it's ruins give us some
 indication of its original importance 
 in the life and work of the parish.
