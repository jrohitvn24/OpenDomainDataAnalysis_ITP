		<title>04Crynant Community Council.</title>
		<content>       In 1974, the Local Government   
 Act set up Community Councils in Wales
 (although Parish Councils still remain
 in England).                          
      For a great many years the Dulais
 Valley was governed by two councils - 
 Dylais Higher and Dylais Lower Parish 
 (later Community) Councils. In 1983   
 the valley was re-organised to form   
 three Councils - Onllwyn, Seven       
 Sisters and Crynant.                  
      The powers of a Community Council
 are limited by statute. In Crynant the
 Council has spent a lot of money      
 (raised froma local 'rate') renewing  
 all the wayside seats, repairing the  
 playground equipment, providing a     
 B.M.X. cycle track and cleaning up the
 cemetery. The Council has also made   
 substantial financial grants to many  
 local voluntary organisations whose   
 work is of benefit to the community.  </content>
