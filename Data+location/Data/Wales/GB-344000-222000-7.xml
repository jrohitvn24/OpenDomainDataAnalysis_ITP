		<title>07Whipping Tops</title>
		<content> During breaktimes at Garway School    
 some children play with whips and     
 tops. The whips are made of lengths of
 dowelling with thongs of leather      
 attached to them. The top is round and
 tapers to a metal tip. At the thick   
 end there is a groove into which the  
 leather of the whip is wound. When    
 the whip is given a sharp tug the     
 leather unwinds and the top starts to 
 spin. If you have pulled hard enough  
 then the top should keep spinning for 
 a long time. When it starts to slow   
 down you whip it to keep it going. If 
 you whip it the wrong way it just     
 stops. Joanna's grandfather made the  
 tops for us. At the school fete this  
 year Richard ran a sideshow to see who
 could keep the top spinning for the   
 longest time.
