		<content> Farming is the major occupation and   
 landuse of the area, which consists of
 marginal land with sheep farming      
 predominating along with some beef    
 cattle. Only 1 farm has a dairy herd. 
   E.E.C. grants have helped to produce
 a marked improvement in fencing,      
 drainage and access roads, leading to 
 increased stocking rates on the       
 improved fields. Some fodder crops of 
 barley, swedes and rape are           
 occasionally grown.                   
    Lambing, shearing and hay-making   
 are the busiest times of the          
 year.Lambing often occurs indoors in  
 special sheds to enable the farmer to 
 supervise the sheep easily. Shearing  
 is either done by the farmer himself  
 or a contractor.                      
    Haymaking is becoming increasingly 
 mechanised.Many of the farmers also   
 make silage.                          </content>
