		<title>19Graig-yr-Hesg quarry</title>
		<content> Graig-yr-Hesg quarry is on the        
 outskirts of Pontypridd.It is a       
 gritstone quarry which makes          
 aggregates for roadstone materials.It 
 is a quality stone because it is      
 hard-wearing and its very high        
 anti-skid characteristics.It is used  
 to make hot tarmacs for laying on the 
 roads locally within a radius of 40   
 miles.Chippings from Graig-yr-Hesg    
 have been sold as far away as Falkirk 
 in Scotland,Cornwall and Kent.The     
 quarry produces approximately 200,000 
 tonnes of crushed rock each year,of   
 which about half is sold as Bitumen   
 coated materials.There are 30 hourly  
 paid employees and 4 staff permanently
 employed at the quarry,with outside   
 firms to transport the chippings.
