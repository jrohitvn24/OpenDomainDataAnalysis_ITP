		<title>02NEWCASTLE CHURCH, BRIDGEND.</title>
		<content>  Newcastle Church stands on a         
 limestone bluff below the remains of  
 the Norman Castle.It overlooks the    
 River Ogmore and the Old Stone Bridge 
 that gave birth to the town of        
 Bridgend.                             
  The square tower has recently been   
 repointed and,although almost four    
 hundred years old,is an impressive    
 structure.Inside we admired the simple
 stone font,the fine timbers and       
 beautiful windows.                    
  We were interested in the varied work
 of the Church.A youth group meets     
 during the winter.Mothers and their   
 children form another group.A fete is 
 held annually.Â£1500.00 had been raised
 on the Saturday before our visit      
 although it had rained heavily        
 throughout the day.                   
  Since Norman times Newcastle Church  
 has served village,town and community.</content>
