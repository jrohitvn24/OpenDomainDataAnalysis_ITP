		<title>10The Edney Gates</title>
		<content> The{Edney Gates}are part of Tredegar  
 House.They were made in 1714 by{      
{William Edney.}They cost Â£650.After a 
 while they started to rust.People     
 searched for a blacksmith to restore  
 them.They found a man called Paul     
 Dennis.They cost Â£52 000 to be        
 repaired.The gates were reopened on   
 May 7th by the Mayor of Newport.We sat
 on the grass to watch the ceremony.We 
 watched the Mayor and Mayoress get out
 of their carriage.A lady gave the     
 Mayor some scissors and he cut the    
 ribbon.The cover came slowly down.The 
 gates were gold plated and were carved
 in very awkward places.They looked    
 lovely.
