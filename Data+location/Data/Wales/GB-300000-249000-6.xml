		<title>06BUILTH (W): FARMING</title>
		<content>  The main occupation locally is       
 farming.The farms are generally family
 -run and average 150 to 250 acres in  
 size.Increased government grants in   
 recent years have allowed             
 more machinery to be bought and       
 contractor are now brought in : to lay
 farm roads or to clear woodland and   
 hedges.Some older farms still have    
 dipping tubs.(where sheep are ducked  
 in insecticide,to prevent sheep       
 scab),which drain into streams.This   
 offends conservationalists.Sheep      
 are shorn from mid June onwards,the   
 wool being sent to factories,to be    
 processed.The breeds of sheep         
 include,Beulah Speckled Face,Suffolk  
 and Welsh Mountain.There are some beef
 cattle:Hereford and Charolais         
 bulls.There is a weekly market in     
 Builth,on Mondays,and the Royal Welsh 
 Show,held annually,at the end of July.</content>
