		<title>01Afon Dysynni</title>
		<content> Most of the hills north of the Afon   
 Dysynni are covered by heath, moor and
 grassland. Much of the lower sections 
 have various tree clusters that sweep 
 down to the river plain (conifer and  
 deciduous). The flood plain is        
 enclosed rough grazing land, chiefly  
 used for sheep and cattle.  Numerous  
 homestead dot the landscape and small 
 tributary valleys flow into the       
 Dysynni and its offshoot canals. Much 
 of the hills that surround the river  
 plain is composed of steep open u or v
 shaped valleys  The Abertrinant Hills,
 South of the Pont Y Garth Weir, are   
 the same as the other surrounding     
 hills except for a densely covered    
 confier and deciduos wood at the      
 bottom of te hill, as it reached the  
 valley floor.
