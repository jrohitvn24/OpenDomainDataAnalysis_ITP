		<content> Llanelli is a great sporting town,    
 with rugby union being the traditional
 game.The Llanelli Rugby Team are known
 as "The Scarlets" and have a great    
 following in the area.In 1985 they    
 defeated Cardiff in the Schweppes cup 
 final at Cardiff Arms Park.There are  
 also two football teams in the South  
 Wales League and a successful cricket 
 team.

 regularly against other schools.We    
 have a 11-a-side football team as well

 team,a cricket team and a netball
