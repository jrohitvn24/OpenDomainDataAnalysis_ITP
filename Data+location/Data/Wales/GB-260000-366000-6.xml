 One day two people came to perform a  
 play for our school.It was called     
 "RAINBOW THE CLOWN".The clown had a   
 friend called Jamie,who was very      
 poor.Jamie wanted to be a clown in the
 circus.Rainbow showed Jamie a trick or
 two.Jamie showed the ringmaster the   
 trick but the man said it was not good
 enough.Jamie went back day after day  
 after day until the man said "o.k you 
 may join the circus,but you must work 
 very hard".                           
            It was a very good play and
 was performed by the NORTHERN AND     
 SCOTTISH DRAMA COMPANY.They visit our 
 school once a year to perform.A WELSH 
 DRAMA COMPANY visits the school once  
 a term and we are allowed to act with 
 them.  Written by Corrina Zarach aged
