		<content>  There is a group of about twenty     
 houses which forms the village of     
 Skenfrith.Apart from this the         
 remainder of the housing is very      
 scattered-mainly farmhouses and       
 cottages.                             
  There has not been much building in  
 the area for over thirty years when   
 some council houses were built in the 
 village.One reason for this is that   
 this is an area of natural beauty and 
 planning has been very strict about   
 new housing.Another reason is that    
 there is no main sewer.The only type  
 of building which has been allowed is 
 the odd infilling in the village and  
 accomodation for farm workers.        
  Some of the houses date from about   
 1600.Most of the houses are built of  
 stone.
