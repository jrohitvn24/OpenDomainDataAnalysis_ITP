		<title>01A day in my life</title>
		<content> I wake up at half past six and go and 
 see if my dad is awake.If he is awake 
 I go and get dressed.I make my bed    
 every morning.After I have made my    
 bed I go and see what is happening    
 downstairs.I put the television on to 
 watch TVam.I lay the table and make a 
 cup of coffee and tea.When my mum     
 comes down she makes my breakfast.When
 I have finished I wash and brush my   
 teeth.I plait my hair.I put my riding 
 hat and boots on.I say goodbye to my  
 mum and dad.I get my bike from the    
 shed,collect the potato peelings and  
 cycle off.I go across the pavement and
 down the lane to my friends place     
 where I keep my pony for the summer.I 
 go and see if Lisa is coming that is  
 the girl who shares a field with me.We
 collect the ponies and bring them down
 and brush them.We put their tack on.We
 normally go for a ride on the lane.   </content>
