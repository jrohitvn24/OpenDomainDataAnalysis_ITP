		<title>06The Welsh Language In Dinas</title>
		<content>    According to census returns,In{1951
 Welsh was spoken in Dinas by{83.6%}of 
 the population.But in{1961}the amount 
 dropped down to{77%.}Then in{1971}it  
 dropped down again to{70.9%.}Then it  
 dropped yet again to{59.6%.}It had    
 gone down every ten years.Less and    
 less each time .                      
 Why is this?.In{1951}I think more     
 people spoke Welsh because there      
 weren't so many people from other     
 places.Most people were local         
 people,and spoke Welsh all the        
 time.In our school now,{1985,}only    
{29%}children speak Welsh out of 51    
 children.But experts predict that the 
 amount of Welsh language spoken in    
 Dinas in years to come gets even less 
 if present trends continue.In{1991}-  
{50.7%}.Then by {2001}it will be{40.8%.
 Sadly the Welsh language seems to be  
 fading away.{Bethan Rees              </content>
