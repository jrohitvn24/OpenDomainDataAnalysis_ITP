		<content> Pentre Dwfr is in a steep sideded     
 valley. Most of the mountains are     
 covered in coniferous trees. The      
 ground is too poor to grow crops and  
 is mostly rough grazing. There are the
 remains of an old quarry on the left  
 side. The school building has been    
 closed                                
 for 4 years. The children of the      
 village now go to Llangollen for their
 education. There was a chapel but this
 had been turned into a house and the  
 pub had been made into a holiday home.
 There was a sign in a window of a     
 house that read "yr hen siop" (the old
 shop) but it is not a shop today. The 
 village has a bus stop, a letter box  
 and a telephone box. There are        
 several cattle grids to stop sheep    
 wandering on the roads.
