		<content> Island". It is surrounded by water and
 reeds but we put down a sort of wooden
 bridge down to cross over. We have    
 camped on the island for days on end. 
 There are badgers on the island and   
 sometimes we see them come out at     
 night.

 My Dad has a lot of dogs. I go with   
 him up on to the hill with them and we
 catch rabbits. Every Boxing Day lots  
 of people meet on Baldwin's Beach with
 their greyhounds and whippets. Races  
 are organised between the dogs to see 
 which is the best.
