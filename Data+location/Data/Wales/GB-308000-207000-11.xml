		<title>11RHYMNEY VALLEY-ECOLOGY (1)</title>
		<content>   Over the last decade or so, land in 
 Rhymney, which has been in the past   
 used for industry, has been reclaimed 
 and it is pleasing to note that       
 considerable success has been         
 achieved.Once again, both flora and   
 fauna are beginning to re-establish   
 themselves in many areas.Sightings    
 have been made of species which are   
 not common in any part of the country.
  Plants from old farm pastures are now
 beginning to establish themselves in  
 mining areas: yellow rattle,wild thyme
 and the trefoil family can seen as can
 a wide variety of grasses.            
   There has been an increase in the   
 butterfly population due mainly to an 
 increase in larval food.Although the  
 cabbage white has probably always been
 present there are now peacock and Red 
 Admirals,Tortoise Shells and Painted  
 Ladies.                               </content>
