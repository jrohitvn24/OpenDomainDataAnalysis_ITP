		<content> Most people in Killay and Sketty are  
 monoglot, but a few are bilingual. My 
 mother speaks Welsh and English. My   
 grandpa spoke Welsh and English and so
 does mv Nan. When I go to the         
 Comprehensive School, I want to take  
 Welsh as a subject. The Headmaster of 
 the Welsh School in Brynmill told us  
 that out of 700 children in Killay,   
 only 10 go to his school, which I     
 think is a great shame. I was going to
 go to the Welsh School, but because my
 father cannot speak Welsh, I did not  
 go. My mother was brought up in a very
 Welsh part of Dyfed. She spoke Welsh  
 until she was 10, then she learnt     
 English. My mother still speaks Welsh 
 to her family. Because this is a      
 University area, there are many       
 students speaking languages other than
 English or Welsh ,e.g. Arabic,Chinese.
