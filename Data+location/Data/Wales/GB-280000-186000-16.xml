		<title>16Scout Jamboree 1985</title>
		<content> In July, 5,000 scouts converged on    
 Margam Park for the largest Jamboree  
 ever held in Wales.  An event staged  
 at a cost of Â£125,000.  The 1500 tents
 covered an area of 50 acres and housed
 scouts from 15 countries. Electricity,
 water, toilets and other services had 
 to be provided, and in addition the   
 scouts had their own Post Office,     
 supermarket, bank and newspaper, the  
 'Margam Mail'.  A radio station was   
 set up with a special call sign and   
 broadcasts were made to radio hams    
 throughout the world.  Activities     
 enjoyed included: abseiling, parascend
 -ing, swimming and rock climbing.  The
 Duke of Kent paid a three hour visit  
 to the Jamboree, but part of the      
 itinerary had to be cancelled because 
 of the driving rain which persisted   
 for most of the event.
