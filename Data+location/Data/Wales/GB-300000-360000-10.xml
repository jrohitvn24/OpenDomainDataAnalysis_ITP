		<title>10HEDGE SURVEY AT NANTGLYN 2.</title>
		<content>    The school hedge was a good site to
 study local ecology.Despite recent    
 cutting plenty of flora and fauna     
 could be observed.The most important  
 flowers were:  Cow Parsley            
 Wild Geranium  Red Campion            
 Buttercup      Greater Stitchwort     
 Wild Rose      Dead Nettle  Charlock  
 There were several unidentified types 
 of grass.                             
    The foliage of the hedge was dense 
 and it was an effective barrier to    
 animals.No birds nests were seen but  
 the following were present,robin wren,
 house martin, swallow,and blackbird.  
    The sunny June weather encouraged a
 variety of insects:                   
 Caterpillars  Red Admiral Butterfly   
 Blackbeetle   Cabbage White Butterfly 
 Greenfly      Wood Slater       Wasp  
 Wolf Spider   Bladder Spider    Earwig
 Crane Fly     Ladybird          Moth  </content>
