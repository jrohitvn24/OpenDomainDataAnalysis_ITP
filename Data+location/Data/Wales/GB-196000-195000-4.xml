		<title>04Housing in Stackpole</title>
		<content> Stackpole village consists of two     
 small council housing estates,houses  
 erected by Lord Cawdor and one private
 house.The council estates were erected
 in the late nineteen forties and      
 early seventies respectively.The      
 former comprises 12 three bedroomed   
 semi_detached houses;a half of these  
 houses are now privately owned.The    
 other estate consists of 23 terraced  
 bungalows grouped in blocks of        
 six,five and three groups of four.Some
 of the bungalows have two bedrooms and
 others have three.Retired people live 
 in the smaller bungalows.             
   The remainder of the houses,except  
 one,have conections with the Cawdor   
 estate.There are 14 of these in       
 all.Three:the School House and the two
 buildings which have been used as a   
 post office,are quite old,possibly    
 dating back to the late 17th.century. </content>
