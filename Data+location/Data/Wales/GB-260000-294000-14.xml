		<title>14OUTWARD BOUND ABERDYFI</title>
		<content>    The first Outward Bound course ,run
 in 1941 at Aberdyfi,was to train young
 Merchant Navy cadets how to handle the
 demands of armed conflict.During our  
 stay in the village we were fortunate 
 enough to meet an elderly gentleman   
 who had moved to the area as an       
 instructor on these first courses.    
    After the war the Outward Bound    
 Trust was formed to promote 'personal 
 development training'for young people.
 Located in a large house overlooking  
 the estuary the Aberdyfi centre is    
 famous for its dinghy and cutter      
 sailing and general water activies.   
    Outward Bound Wales in liaison with
 the village forms the local mountain  
 rescue service, maintains the Aberdyfi
 Sailing Museum and provids crew for   
 the lifeboat station.
