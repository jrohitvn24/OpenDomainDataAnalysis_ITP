		<content> This area is generally associated with
 the{Non Conformist Church Movement}and
 there are numerous examples of chapels
 such as{Methodist,Independent}and     
{Baptist,}to be found.There are also   
 examples of other faiths to be found  
 in the area such as{Church in Wales,  
{Catholic Church}and{Jehovah's Witness.
 However apart from the latter two     
 faiths,there appears to be a general  
 decline in the number of people       
 attending church or chapel services.  
 A few chapel buildings have been      
 abandoned altogether and are now for  
 sale.These tend to be in a state of   
 decay and are subjected to a great    
 deal of vandalism.                    
 It would seem that the once strong    
 influence of the chapel within the    
 community has disappeared and is now  
 only prevalent with the older         
 generation.                           </content>
