  The fashions I like best are jeans   
 and tops but I also wear nice clothes 
 like quite shhort mini-skirts which   
 are black leather and I wear a stud   
 belt with them.                       
  And I have got a disco dress which is
 black with dots on and sequins around 
 the top.And I also wear nice jogging  
 suits and all-in-one suits,the last   
 one I had was white with black lines  
 on it.                                
  I wear high healed shoes and I have  
 had a new pair which are white with   
 plated sides.And I like low back      
 dresses and I have got two.Ialso like 
 flick back hair styles.My freind      
 Rebecca also likes jeans and tops but 
 she doesn't like low back dresses or  
 high heals and she also doesn't like  
 mini skirts thats the fashions I like.</content>
