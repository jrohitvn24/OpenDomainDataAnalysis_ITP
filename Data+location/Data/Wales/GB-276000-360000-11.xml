		<content> The housing in Llanrwst, although     
 mainly old, is of a more urban nature.
 Many of the oldest buildings, some of 
 which had fallen into disuse and      
 disrepair have recently been restored 
 as dwellings. A group of very old,    
 dilapidated cottages have been turned 
 into single person accommodation,     
 warden controlled, and other homes    
 built nearby make a compact group. The
 old brewery has been adapted into 5   
 apartments, and in the same street the
 old Tannery has been altered to make a
 workshop and 2 flats. There is an     
 estate of council houses and many     
 privately owned homes.                
 Trefriw has a small council estate    
 situated at the top of a very steep   
 hill and includes houses for old      
 people. Houses in great variety are   
 scattered between the two main centres
 of population.                        </content>
