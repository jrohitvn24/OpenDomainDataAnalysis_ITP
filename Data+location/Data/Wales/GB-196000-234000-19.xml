		<title>19THE SPIRIT UNDER THE STAIRS</title>
		<content> Have you ever noticed that when you   
 walk up your stairs a moaning and     
 squeaking comes from them? Do you stop
 to think what it might be? One day I  
 decided to go through the doorway     
 under the stairs to see what made the 
 noise.Through the door I went and ran 
 out again with fright.After a while   
 overcome with curiosity I went in     
 again and there it hung floating in   
 the air moaning dreadfully! Are you a 
 ghost I stammered? I am a spirit who  
 has roamed for 300 years. The name of 
 this house is Cilgelynen&lt;the house of 
 the holly>.I was a priest.This was a  
 safe house.I went into the priest hole
 to sleep and there I died.I became a  
 spirit and haunted the house.The house
 was built by a Scotsman who built a   
 priest hole to allow enemies of the   
 Roundheads to hide.It was used by     
 people like me to hide.               </content>
