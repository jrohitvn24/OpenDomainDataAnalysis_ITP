		<content>   This block contains several country 
 houses once occupied by the gentry.{  
{Trefeirian}is now a licenced club, its
 members being employees at the N.Wales
 Hospital;{Gwynfryn}has been adapted as
 a unit for patients;{Wynne's Park}has 
 become a nursing/residential home for 
 the elderly;{Brondyffryn Hall}is a    
 Special school for autistic children. 
   The Ystrad river once powered the   
 corn mills at{Segrwyd}and{Brookhouse.}
 The former is now a private residence 
 and the latter a licensed restaurant. 
   Substantial areas of farm land      
 adjacent to Lon Llewelyn have been    
 developed for municipal and private   
 housing. Animals once driven on foot  
 to and from Smithfield are now carried
 in livestock lorries. Forms of        
 transport once dependent on horse-    
 power have been replaced by motor     
 vehicles so garages have been erected.</content>
