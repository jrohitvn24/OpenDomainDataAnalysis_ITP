		<title>18Sarn Young Farmers</title>
		<content>  The Young Farmers meet in the{Village
{Hall}every{Monday}at eight o'clock.   
 They used to let people of eleven join
 but they soon stopped that,because    
 they only spoilt it for the older     
 ones.Now they only allow children of  
 thirteen or older to join.            
  There are{twenty nine members}in     
 Young Farmers Club.The young farmers  
 have a{Rally}once a year.A girl has to
 change a car wheel and a boy has to   
 iron a shirt.There is disco dancing,  
 boys shear sheep while the girls lap  
 the wool.There is cooking.You can     
 either cook Chinese or Japanese food. 
 Not so long ago they did a play in{   
{Theatre Hafren.}It was a western.Once 
 they did a{sponsored bike}ride which  
 was twenty miles.Every year they have 
 a competition against each other.They 
 practise for the rally nearly every   
 day of the week.                      </content>
