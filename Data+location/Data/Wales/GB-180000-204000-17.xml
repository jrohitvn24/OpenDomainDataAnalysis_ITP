		<title>17Windsurfing in Dale</title>
		<content> Many visitors and some local people   
 enjoy windsurfing in Dale Bay.It      
 is particularly suitable for beginners
 because there are seldom very big     
 waves and a good rescue service is    
 available from the coastguards and    
 from the West Wales Windsurfing       
 School.Windsurfing is also popular    
 because cars can be parked by the     
 water's edge and boards launched      
 easily.Spares,boards and wetsuits can 
 be obtained from the nearby shop.The  
 usual windsurfing area is about 2     
 sq.km,though some experts like        
 to go for longer trips.Lessons and    
 courses are given by the windsurfing  
 school,and people can learn the basic 
 techniques in about a day.There is    
 hardly a day from April to Oct. when  
 there are no windsurfers out sailing  
 and in the height of the summer season
 up to 60 boards a day may be seen.    </content>
