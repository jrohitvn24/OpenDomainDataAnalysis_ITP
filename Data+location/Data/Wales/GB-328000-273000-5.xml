		<content> Farming and forestry provide the main 
 employment. All four farms are worked 
 by the family with contract labour    
 being engaged for special jobs at     
 harvest itme, and for hedge cutting   
 and sheep shearing. Among the few not 
 engaged in farming, one is a salesman 
 and one an engineer working on methane
 gas, produced from farm waste, at     
 Bishop's Castle 12Km away. A scrap    
 metal dealer has a yard near Five     
 Turnings and employs three men who    
 live in Knighton.
