		<content> THIS IS A RURAL AREA WITH ONE SMALL   
 VILLAGE AND A NUMBER OF SMALL FARMS   
 SITUATED AMONG THE FOOTHILLS OF THE   
 BLACK MOUNTAINS OF BRECONSHIRE, POWYS.
 THE A438 BRECON TO HEREFORD ROAD      
 CROSSES ONE CORNER AND THE A4078 FROM 
 TALGARTH TO HAY WHICH CROSSES OVER TWO
 KILOMETRE SQUARES IN THE ONLY OTHER A 
 ROAD. A GOOD METALLED BUT TWISTING    
 ROAD JOINS THIS TO VELINDRE VILLAGE   
 AND ON TO HAY AND CARRIES THE WEEKLY  
 MARKET BUS. ALL OTHER ROADS IN THE    
 AREA ARE DESIGNATED POOR. THE         
 CONIFEROUS HAY FOREST COVERS ONE      
 KILOMETRE BORDERING THE MOUNTAIN AND  
 THE REST OF THE AREA IS MAINLY GRAZING
 FOR SHEEP, CATTLE AND HORSES. THERE IS
 ONE RESIDENTIAL CENTRE, AN OUTDOOR    
 ACTIVITY CENTRE AND A COMMERCIAL      
 TREKKING CENTRE, A POTTERY AND AN     
 ANCIENT CHURCH.
