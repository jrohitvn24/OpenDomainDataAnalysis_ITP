		<title>06FARMING-UPPER RHYMNEY VALLEY</title>
		<content> Much farming in the Upper Rhymney     
 Valley, is mainly on land reclaimed   
 from the coal and iron mines of the   
 last century.The land has been        
 flattened and seeded for rough        
 pasture.Many consider that this new{  
{pasture}is not as productive as the   
 old established pasture.              
 There is no arable farming in the area
 and animals kept are mostly Welsh     
 mountain sheep which produce          
 fleece.The sheep are kept for about 4 
 seasons and served by 1 ram.Lambs are 
 sold when 7-8 months old before winter
 sets in.                              
   There are small numbers of Welsh    
 Black Cattle and there is one pig farm
 in the area,  together with small     
 numbers of goats and poultry.         
   Each farm supports two or three     
 horses,  but there are a considerable 
 number of wild ponies on the hillside.</content>
