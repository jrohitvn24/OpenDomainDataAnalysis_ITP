		<title>09Lead mining in Eryrys</title>
		<content>  The earliest records of lead mining  
 in Eryrys are 1295, when the Earl of  
 Surrey recruited skilled lead miners  
 from Eryrys to work in Devon.         
  In the 18th century several mining   
 companies operated in Eryrys and      
 continued to produce ore according to 
 demand. By the early 19th century     
 mining was expanding, much of Eryrys  
 was built. Records show that the      
 population was over 1000. Miners came 
 from other areas including Cornwall,  
 their names are still evident in the  
 area today.                           
  Work was hard and poorly paid. Miners
 supplimented their wages by collecting
 heather to make brooms for sale.      
  The mines had closed by the begining 
 of the 20th century, evidence of their
 earlier importance can still be seen  
 in old buildings, ruined cottages,    
 spoil and shafts, often capped.       </content>
