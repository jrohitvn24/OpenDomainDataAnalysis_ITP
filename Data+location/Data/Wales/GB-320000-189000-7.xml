		<content>  Crosskeys Junior and Infant mixed    
 school is an historic building. It was
 built in 1880 following the Education 
 Act of 1870.                          
  The school was built to cater for    
 some 300 pupils although in 1980 the  
 number was 50.                        
  In 1985, the school has a roll of    
 just 34 and is due to close at the end
 of the summer term 1985. The reasons  
 given by the Welsh Office are "social,
 economic and environmental". Most of  
 the pupils will transfer to Waunfawr  
 Junior and Infant School. It has 137  
 pupils and 45 under-5's in the nursery
 section. This school was built in 1897
 and will be taking 19 children        
 following the closure of the Crosskeys
 school.
