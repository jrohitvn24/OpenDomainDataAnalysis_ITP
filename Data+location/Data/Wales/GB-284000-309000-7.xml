		<content> The Presbyterian chapel which         
 accommodates over 300 is seldom full  
 nowadays except on special occasions  
 like the Cymanfa Ganu when Welsh      
 voices are raised in a glory of sound.
 There is a regular singing practice. A
 service is conducted most Sundays, the
 regular minister living at Cemmaes. 20
 children attend Sunday school and     
 there is a children's service every   
 Christmas. The bible class is not as  
 well attended as in former years. The 
 cost of maintainance is constantly    
 rising and can only present a worrying
 future. The smaller Congregational    
 chapel is in a similar postion. Some  
 villagers attend church at Cemmaes or 
 Mallwyd. The burial ground for the 2  
 chapels was given by Major Walton of  
 Cwmllecoediog &amp; a committee of members
 of both chapels superintends its      
 upkeep.                               </content>
