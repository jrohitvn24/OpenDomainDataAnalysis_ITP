		<content> We wanted to find out what people     
 thought of Abercynon as a shopping    
 centre.We made up two{questionnaires} 
 and asked all the parents of children 
 in the school to answer four questions
 so that we were able to find out      
 peoples opinions.Most people shop less
 in the town since the Co-Op has closed
 and that a new supermarket was        
 needed,but only one of the shopkeepers
 agreed with.Only four of the shoppers 
 were satisfied with the centre when it
 came to buying clothes,most of them   
 prefer to use Cardiff or Pontypridd   
 the majority of shoppers said that{   
{prices}were to high  but almost all of
 them thought that the{service}they got
 was good.Younger people with families 
 use their cars to shop once a week in 
 large supermarkets because the prices 
 are more reasonable.
