		<title>14TOURISM   PENARTH.</title>
		<content> Penarth, a gracious Victorian seaside 
 resort, is still a popular destination
 with the day tripper. The town's      
 streets, colourful gardens and parks  
 are the reason for Penarth being      
 called the garden by the sea.         
   Alexandra Park extends from the town
 centre to the esplanade. The park     
 contains many beautiful shrubs, trees 
 and flower beds. The Windsor and      
 Italian Gardens are other areas of    
 beauty. There is also a municipal     
 bowling green at Belle Vue Park.      
  There is a variety of things to do in
 the area including sports, disco      
 dancing at the Commodore on the pier, 
 play bingo at the old Washington      
 Cinema, watch theatre groups or shows 
 at the Paget Rooms or perhaps visit   
 the Turner Art Gallery to see fine    
 paintings, bronzes and furniture.
