		<title>12  Schools on the Patch</title>
		<content> There are two primary schools,a       
 comprehensive and a special school on 
 our Domesday patch.The special school 
 takes care of children who are        
 disabled.Pupils from my               
 school,Maesyrhandir primary,are       
 allowed to go and{play with the       
{children from the special school at   
{dinner time.                          
  The comprehensive,Newtown high,has   
 1200 pupils and a staff of 76.One in  
 five children stay on for O or A      
 levels.A choir from the school has won
 many prizes in local and national     
 eisteddfodau.                         
  Some of the pupils have become quite 
 famous;football players,golfers and   
 journalists on famous newspapers.     
 The head master told us that most of  
 the children don't mind wearing the   
 school{uniform.All are worried about  
{jobs when they leave.                 </content>
