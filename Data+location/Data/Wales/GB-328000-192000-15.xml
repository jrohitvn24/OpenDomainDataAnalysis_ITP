		<content>  Alfa-Laval is a prosperous marketing 
 company,supplying pumps to the British
 Dairy Farmer and exporting to fifteen 
 countries world wide.                 
  Their modern offices and warehouse   
 facilities are set in parkland on the 
 Ty-Coch Industrial Estate. The site   
 was chosen for its proximity to both  
 town and leisure resources.           
  Alfa-Laval came to CWmbran in 1974   
 because the location was ideal. There 
 was a good transport network, also    
 government grants were available and  
 housing in the area was plentiful.

 people who all work from 8.30am until 
 4.30pm. They draw the majority of     
 their workforce locally.
