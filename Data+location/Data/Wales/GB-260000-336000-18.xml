		<title>18INDUSTRY COOKE'S WORKS</title>
		<content> Although the area is mainly rural in  
 character, Penrhyn is usually         
 associated with Cooke's Explosive     
 Works, a subsidiary of I.C.I.         
 Employing 150 people in 2 shifts      
 6am-2pm-9pm the explosive produced is 
 known as PENOBEL ( after the village  
 and the inventor of dynamite). Raw    
 materials from many sources are taken 
 by train to Blaenau ffestiniog and    
 then by lorry to the factory. The     
 explosives produced are also          
 distributed by road and rail through  
 B. Ff. to coal mines and quarries in  
 the UK and abroad. The local stone    
 quarry also uses the explosives.      
 Until the Barmouth viaduct was        
 weakened by marine worms, materials   
 were handled at the local station, &amp;  
 although repair is almost complete the
 goods sidings were lifted in 1985 so  
 goods trains will not stop here again.</content>
