		<title>15THE CATHEDRAL</title>
		<content> The Cathedral of St.Asaph was founded 
 in 560 by St.Kentigern from           
 Scotland.He landed on the banks of the
 River Dee and explored the surrounding
 countryside.                          
                                       
    He chose the present site because  
 it was geographically perfect with two
 rivers and a steep hill to keep away  
 unwanted visitors.Nothing of the      
 original "LLAN" is left.The present   
 structure was mainly built in the 15th
 century.The Nave was built c.1370.The 
 Quire was rebuilt in the early 1800's 
 to replace the one destroyed by Owain 
 Glyndwr in his rebellion against the  
 English in 1402.The present Bishop is 
 Alwyn Rice Jones and his diocese      
 stretches from Newtown to Queensferry 
 and Llandudno to Bala.
