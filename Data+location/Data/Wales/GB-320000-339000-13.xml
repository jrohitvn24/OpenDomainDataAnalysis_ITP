		<title>13THE TANNERY,LLANGOLLEN.</title>
		<content> This works is in{Church Street,}the   
 original main road through the town.It
 opened{250 years ago}as a woollen     
 mill.Later it became a tannery.Then in
 the 1950's when plastic was introduced
 it was cheaper to produce than        
 leather, and the demand for leather   
 fell.Now it is a{Collection Depot}for 
 sheep skins.{Eight}men work there five
 days a week for eight hours a day.The 
 skins come from the{Isle of Man,}the  
{North Wales}coast and{Wrexham.}The    
 actual work has not changed much over 
 the years.They still use the concrete 
 bath with wooden paddles to beat the  
 fleeces clean.The only modern machines
 they use are forklift trucks and      
 lorries to load and unload the        
 skins.When the skins have been cleaned
 most of them go to{Newtown}and are    
 used to make slippers,mittens,gloves  
 or rugs.                              </content>
