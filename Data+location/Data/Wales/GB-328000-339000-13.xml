		<title>13ROADS</title>
		<content> MOST OF THE ROADS ARE REALLY TRACKS   
 AND COUNTRY LANES .THERE ARE TWO MAIN 
 ROADS ,THE A5 GOING FROM LONDON TO    
 HOLY HEAD AND THE A483 FROM CHESTER TO
 SWANSEA .THE MAIN ROADS ARE VERY BUSY 
 INFACT WE DID A SURVEY AND FOUND THAT 
 THE A5 CARRIES ONE VEHICLE EVERY FOUR 
 SECONDS. CHILDREN THINK THAT THE A5 IS
 BAD BECAUSE IT HAS NO WAYS OF GETTING 
 ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD. 
 MOST OF THE LANES ARE IN VERY BAD     
 CONDITION AND SOME INFACT ARE BREAKING
 UP AND SUBSIDING .THIS IS BECAUSE     
 THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY FROM THE    
 GOVERNMENT , AND THE LOCAL COUNCIL    
 CANNOT AFFORD TO MEND THEM.
