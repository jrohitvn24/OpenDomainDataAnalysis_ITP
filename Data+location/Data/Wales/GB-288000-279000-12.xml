		<title>12LLANGURIG - HOUSING</title>
		<content>  A disturbing feature at this time is 
 that there is{outline planning        
 permission for only{4 private         
{dwellings}in Llangurig and{no plans   
 for{council dwellings;}a feature that 
 could well effect the future of the   
 school.                               
  All but one of the existing council  
 dwellings have been purchased by the  
 tenants.{Most houses are privately    
{owned.                                
  Properties available to rent are poor
 little terraced dwellings owned mainly
 by the two chapels.                   
  Several{run-down country cottages    
 have been purchased and{renovated}by  
{people from England.                  
  The lack of any planning suggests the
 village will be static for some years 
 to come.                              
  There are 4 council-owned old peoples
 bungalows.                            </content>
