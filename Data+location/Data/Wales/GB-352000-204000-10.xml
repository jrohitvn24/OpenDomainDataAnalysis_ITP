		<title>10My Village School,The Narth.</title>
		<content>    I attend The Narth Infant and      
 Junior School.It is a small village   
 school with 29 pupils and two         
 teachers.It was built in 1910.There   
 are 15 infants and 14 juniors.We also 
 have a dinner lady,a clerk and a      
 caretaker.                            
    In the main building,are an infant 
 classroom,a quiet room for library and
 television, and a cloakroom.The junior
 classroom is a demountable. There are 
 four outside toilets and a shed.      
    My favourite lessons are           
 Mathematics and English.We do a lot of
 other subjects such as pottery,       
 religious education,science,history,  
 nature,drama,goegraphy,games,health,  
 art, needlework and music.            
    School begins at 9am and ends 3pm  
 for infants &amp; 3:30pm for the juniors. 
 We have a playtime in the morning &amp;   
 afternoon and lunch at midday.        </content>
