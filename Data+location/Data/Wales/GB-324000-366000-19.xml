		<title>19INDUSTRY  LOCAL SURVEY.</title>
		<content> The block we surveyed was mainly      
 agricultural land with very little    
 present day industry.In the past,     
 however,coalmines and clay pits were  
 important sources of employment and   
 these sites,now derelict,are a useful 
 resource for industrial archaeology.  
 Modern day industry within the survey 
 area is limited to mechanical         
 engineering and haulage.The two small 
 haulage companies specialise in retail
 and distribution of packed food and   
 drinks to supermarkets and local high 
 streets.The mechanical engineering    
 firm concentrates on the repair of    
 delivery trucks.They are small scale  
 employers, one employing 20 people,the
 other only 2. As can be seen from the 
 above description, industrial activity
 plays a minor role in what is         
 basically an agricultural community.
