		<content> The undulating landscape, with fields,
 dingles, woods, cliffs, dunes,        
 saltmarsh and beach, provides a varied
 habitat for all sorts of flora and    
 fauna, including some rarities. In the
 1984/85 Estuary Bird count, 2 Brent   
 Geese, an unusual species for this    
 area, were seen. In summer 1985 a pair
 of Ringed Plover surprised bird       
 watchers by successfully hatching two 
 young from a nest on the beach despite
 constant disturbance by visitors. The 
 heronry on Craig Ddu cliff had 19     
 occupied nests. Over 400 different    
 species of wild plant have so far been
 identified in the tetrad around the   
 village; recording goes on. The cliffs
 here are geologically interesting. The
 climate is relatively mild, wet and   
 windy, with usually pleasant but      
 unpredictable summers and the winters 
 escaping the worst of the cold.       </content>
