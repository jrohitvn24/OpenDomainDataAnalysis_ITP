		<title>11PUBS AND CLUBS</title>
		<content> The{pub}opened in 1830, most likely to
 serve the passing drovers. It is well 
 used by people from outside the area, 
 who like a visit to Painscastle for a 
 meal and a drink. It suffers now      
 because some locals go to the golf    
 club but the landlord feels his main  
 problem is that customers will not    
 keep to the permitted hours, behave   
 themselves and act in a proper manner.
 The{Golf Club}opened in 1983 and is   
 the up and coming place to go. A local
 family, the Merediths, sponsered it   
 and it provides a place of            
 entertainment and work for the local  
 people.Its attractions are frequent   
 apperances of celebrities, good beer  
 at lower prices than other pubs and a 
 reasonable meal at a good price. It   
 particularly appeals to the younger   
 set as children are welcomed there    
 with their parents.                   </content>
