		<title>03MAENDY VILLAGE - ATTITUDES</title>
		<content>     There are about 30 houses. The    
 B4270 virtually cuts the village in   
 half. Many people would like a bypass 
 built. It has a primary school &amp; a    
 chapel which holds services &amp; Sunday  
 School in Welsh. Only 9 people speak  
 Welsh, 2 fluently. Most people come   
 from England, though 1 family was from
 the USA &amp; 1 from S.AFRICA. Only 2     
 families were native to the Vale. The 
 chapel goers come from all over the   
 area.                                 
     There are no shops &amp; the Post     
 Office has closed from lack of trade. 
 People use Cowbridge for their daily  
 shopping &amp; usually Cardiff for more   
 important purchases.                  
     Most people liked the village, the
 adults complained about noise &amp; litter
 from the school &amp; some children found 
 it boring because their friends didn't
 live close by.                        </content>
