          Brynna's local goverment has 
 found people like Mr T Hughes to stand
 for election and who ever has the most
 votes wins and becomes a local        
 councillor. The local authority       
 services clean roads,sweeps them.As   
 well dustmen are also a local         
 authority service.So are fireman and  
 they also provid policemen.The civil  
 servents do the paper work involved in
 the local goverments plans.A          
 councillor  holds a surgery to let    
 people come and say what must be done 
 or what they don't understand.A       
 councillor is a link between goverment
 and the people.
