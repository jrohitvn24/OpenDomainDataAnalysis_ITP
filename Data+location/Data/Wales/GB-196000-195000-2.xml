		<title>02Farming in Stackpole</title>
		<content>  The Stackpole area contains a variety
 of types of farming.Included within   
 its boundaries are dairy, beef, sheep,
 grain and early potato farms. There is
 also a horticulture business.         
 Individual farms do not specialise but
 instead diversify into two or even    
 more of the above products. Dairy,beef
 and sheep,the main industries,are now 
 farmed in roughly the same proportions
    A  farmer in the area describes the
 current state of the  farming as being
 "in crisis".The introduction of EEC   
 quotas in the dairy industry two years
 ago has meant a decrease in the amount
 of milk produced locally and therefore
 a derease in the income of the dairy  
 farmer.One farm has subsequently      
 changed to beef.The potato harvest has
 also been a disaster this year with   
 potatoes beung allowed to rot in the  
 fields.                               </content>
