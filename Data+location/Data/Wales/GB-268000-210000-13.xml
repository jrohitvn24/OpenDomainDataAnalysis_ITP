		<content> Our school is one of four in the      
 immediate area but is not the         
 smallest.                             
 The main language of our school is    
 Welsh as is the language of three of  
 the schools.                          
 Our school was built in 1912 and has  
 ages ranging from three year olds who 
 only attend for a morning, to eleven  
 year olds who attend full time and    
 will leave to attend the Comprehensive
 School which is a mere three          
 kilometres away.                      
 We come under the West Glamorgan      
 Education Authority.
