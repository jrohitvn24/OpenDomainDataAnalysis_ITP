		<title>10Rare Birds in Sarn 2</title>
		<content>  Mr Pritchard first became{interested}
 in birds when he was eleven years old.
 He spends 2 hours per week with his   
 birds.The birds stay in their house,  
 summer and winter.The houses are not  
 heated in the winter because the birds
 are used to cold weather.His{favourite
{bird}is called the Cockateal because  
 it will live in an aviary with any    
 other bird, and can be taught to talk.
 He loses about 5 birds in the winter  
 months because of the cold weather.   
 Sometimes some of his birds abandon   
 their nest after being disturbed by   
 mice, or fighting with other birds in 
 the area.The only wild birds that     
 frighten his are the hawks.The only   
 loud noises that disturb his birds are
 low flying aircraft.The first birds he
 started breeding were racing pigeons. 
 The highest price he has been paid    
 for a bird is Â£100.                   </content>
