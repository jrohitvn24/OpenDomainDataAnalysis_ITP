		<title>10RHYMNEY BIOGRAPHIES</title>
		<content> The Valleys of South Wales have       
 traditionally produced poets and      
 musicians of the highest calibre, and 
 the Upper Rhymney Valley is no        
 exception.                            
  It seems that the Welsh way of life  
 is conducive to producing talent and  
 genius.                               
   Those of artistic talent were born  
 into a harsh working class            
 background,and yet against almost     
 insurmountable odds reached up to the 
 pinnacle of success in their own      
 chosen fields.Much of their work centr
 ed on the life of the working man and 
 the impact of early industrial        
 communities on an often drab and drear
 y existence.As chroniclers of their   
 times their social comments are       
 invaluable,since they were often able 
 to bring out the warmth of family life
 in those hard depressing times.       </content>
