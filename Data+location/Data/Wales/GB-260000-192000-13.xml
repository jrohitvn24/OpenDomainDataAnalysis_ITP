		<content> In our area, there are sandstones,    
 shales and some coal seams. Shales and
 coals are soft &amp; form "flat benches". 
 At the tops of the slopes, we have    
 rough grazing &amp; quarries. Some small  
 areas of farmland are used as         
 unofficial rubbish dumps, but most    
 farmland is unspoilt and animals such 
 as foxes &amp; hares are common. Many     
 parts of the area have families of    
 magpies and a pair of buzzards is     
 often seen. An increase in the amount 
 of allotment land has curbed the      
 activities of rabbits and hares during
 the day. Cwm-llwyd Reserve features   
 deciduous woods,ferns,marshland and   
 grazing land.There are many grasses   
 and wild flowers, such as             
 sea-couch,false oat, purple moor grass
 and brown knapweed.
