		<content>    A general day in the life of a     
 smallholder is very busy. It starts   
 early in the morning because the dogs 
 have to be taken for a walk and then  
 fed and given a drink. There are three
 dogs called Sir Mutt, (Smutty) who is 
 the oldest and the friendliest dog, he
 is 13 years old, Bilbery (Billy) is   
 10 years old, and Friend, (Friendy)   
 also 10. The dogs are exercised along 
 the lane. Then the other animals have 
 to be tended to and cleaned out. The  
 goats are let out to graze, there are 
 3 goats and 1 kid. There names are    
 Titch, Polly, Bonny and Daniel. You   
 can't get Bonny to move when she      
 doesn't want to, and she bites        
 Wellington boots. The chickens are fed
 and then the eggs are collected. By   
 now it's lunchtime. After lunch Girlie
 the horse is checked to see if she has
 enough food and that she is safe.     </content>
