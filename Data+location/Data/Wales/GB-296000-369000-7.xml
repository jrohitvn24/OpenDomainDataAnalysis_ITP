		<title>07MILK HAS GOT A LOT OF BOTTLE</title>
		<content> A typical modern farm is one like{Tal 
{Y Bryn}with its intensive farming.On  
 this 20 hectar farm Mr &amp; Mrs Roberts  
 keep 50 fresian cross holstein cows.  
 Eight cows are milked at the same time
 in the milkimg parlour and the milk   
 goes straight from the cow along the  
 pipes to the dairy.It is then cooled  
 before it goes into the bulk tank.On  
 most farms the story ends when the    
 tanker comes for the milk,but at Tal Y
 Bryn they bottle the milk themselves. 
 The milk flows from the tank through  
 the pasteuriser into the bottles.Twice
 a week the milk is put through the    
 separator to produce cream and skimmed
 milk,some of which is used to make    
 yogurt and buttermilk.These are then  
 sold as{Llaeth Y Llan}products.In July
 1985 milk is 23p a bottle,skimmed milk
 is 20p,buttermilk is 20p a carton and 
 yogurt is 18p a pot.                  </content>
