		<title>11   FELINDRE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>   The village hall was built in 1950. 
 It was built because the people wanted
 a place where they could hold meetings
 dances,whist drives and concerts. It  
 was built by Garth Garages in Knighton
 and it cost Â£1,560. The money was     
 raised by the people in the community.
 The hall is run by the village hall   
 committee. Every year they hold a show
 and sports to raise money to clean the
 hall and repair it. In 1983 the hall  
 was renovated. The improvements cost  
 Â£15,342. The hall is a vital amenity  
 for the community. It  is used by the 
 Young Farmers'Club and the Women's    
 Institute. They hold regular meetings 
 there. There are concerts in the      
 winter months. On November 5th a      
 bonfire is built in the field outside 
 the hall and there is a firework      
 display. Afterwards refreshments are  
 served in the hall with a disco.      </content>
