		<title>13St.Donats Castle</title>
		<content>  St.Donats Castle is thought to date  
 back to Norman times, but none of the 
 present buildings has any Norman      
 connection.The tiny church next to the
 castle contains some early Norman     
 work, which might suggest there would 
 also have been a castle here in Norman
 times.If this were so it would        
 probably have been a wood and earthen 
 motte and bailey affair.              
  The stone castle was built by the    
 Stradling family who probably came    
 over with William the Conqueror.The   
 earliest parts of the present castle  
 were built at the end of the 13th. or 
 the beginning of the 14th.century.The 
 present castle is in the form of two  
 concentric rings ,or curtain walks    
 against which later buildings have    
 been constructed.The Stradling family 
 lived at the castle for 4 centuries.
