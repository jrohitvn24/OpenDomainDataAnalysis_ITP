		<content> We looked at churches and chapels in  
 the area and found that there were    
 eleven.There were seven Welsh chapels:
 Ebenezer,Bethel,Zion,Carmel,Tabor,    
 Eglwys Adulam and Capel Sion.These    
 chapels had three facts in common.    
                                       
 1.All held their services in Welsh and
 there were very few Welsh speaking    
 people now living in the area.        
                                       
 2.All the buildings were over one     
 hundred years old and the             
 congregations elderly.                
                                       
 3.All were poorly attended and two;   
 Ebenezer and Capel Sion, were about to
 close down.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
