		<title>02TONMAWR - AN OUTLINE HISTORY</title>
		<content> Tonmawr was built to house the        
 colliers who worked in any of half a  
 dozen drift mines in the              
 immediate area. Drifts -or{levels-    
 were started by a number of           
 independent capitalists who moved into
 the area. In one or two cases, local  
 farmers started drift mines on their  
 land. Local sandstone was quarried out
 for building. The problem of getting  
 the coal out of the valley was solved 
 by building railways. The main coal   
 carrying line ran from{Abercregan}via 
 Tonmawr, down to{Briton Ferry.}The    
 most ambitious railway development is 
 credited to a capitalist called{Parson
{but as this}enterprise broke him      
 financially, a bridge in the area -now
 demolished- that was built by him is  
 called Parson's Folly ... a name      
 sometimes given to the whole Parson   
 railway.                              </content>
