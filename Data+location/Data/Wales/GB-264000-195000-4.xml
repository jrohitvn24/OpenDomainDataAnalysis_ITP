		<title>04CAERSALEM CHAPEL, SWANSEA</title>
		<content>    Caersalem Baptist Chapel, built in 
 1840, is of interest today because of 
 its continued use of the Welsh        
 language. Regular services held       
 entirely in Welsh take place here.    
   Welsh was the main spoken language  
 of the area until the Second World    
 War. Its decline can be attributed to 
 the prewar arrival of immigrant       
 workers needed to build the railway   
 lines for the collieries and to the   
 post-war construction of large housing
 estates, both private and Council.    
   Caersalem is also of interest       
 historically. The original chapel for 
 the area was Mynyddbach Chapel        
 (Nonconformist, built 1761).          
 Contrasting views caused a split in   
 this congregation and half set to work
 to build Caersalem, using local stone 
 and the labour of 'strike-bound'      
 miners.                               </content>
