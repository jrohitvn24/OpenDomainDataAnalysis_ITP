		<content> Our 4km by  3km area of land can be   
 split into three broad areas -        
{(1).An area of mainly deciduous trees,
{with a smaller area of introduced     
{conifers. }                           
{(2).An area of mainly dairy farming   
{with smaller areas of market gardening
{with three small reservoirs.          
{(3) A modern residential area with    
{the most expensive houses built in the
{last 50 years.                        
 Many interesting people live in our   
 area including the Lord Lieutenant of 
 Dyfed and Mr.Adriano Candelori,a      
 famous sculptor.                      
 We have seen a wild service tree in   
 our area,which is one of the rarest   
 trees in Britain.We have also found   
 out many facts about two famous       
 houses,a local brewery and old iron   
 furnaces,as well as typical days in   
 the lives of five children.           </content>
