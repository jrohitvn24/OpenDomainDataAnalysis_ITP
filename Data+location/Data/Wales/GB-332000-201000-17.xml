		<content> Glascoed villagers attend social      
 functions organised by the village    
 social committee.A party for adults   
 and children is held to begin the New 
 Year.Spring and summer activities     
 include walks and treasure hunts.     
 In September our main event is        
 Glascoed Expo.which takes the form of 
 a horticultural show,displays and     
 demonstrations of local craft also    
 being staged with sideshows for more  
 entertainment.A Bonfire Party held in 
 November brings the year's events to a
 close.                                
 Winter evening classes ceased this    
 year because the school building in   
 which they were held closed in        
 February 1985.The future of some      
 social functions is in doubt as there 
 are inadequate facilities to cater for
 the number of residents.
