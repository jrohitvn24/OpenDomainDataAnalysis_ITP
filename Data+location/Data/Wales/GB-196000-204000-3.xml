		<content>   On Friday 3rd May the Secretary of  
 State and County M.P., Nicholas       
 Edwards unveiled a plaque stating that
 the{Â£1.2 million}Westfield Marina was 
 open.                                 
   The Marina was built by Preseli     
 District Council with aid from the    
 Welsh Office and the European Economic
 Community. The operators Camper and   
 Nicholsons have spent over half a     
 million pounds equipping the Marina   
 for the boats that they hope will come
 and board there.The Marina, when      
 complete, will hold 350 boats.        
   Govan Johns who was born and bred in
 Pembrokeshire, is now the manager of  
 the Westfield Marina. He said, "The   
 Marina which will eventually provide  
 over 300 berths is the first in       
 Pembrokeshire and is setting the scene
 for the expanding tourist industry."
