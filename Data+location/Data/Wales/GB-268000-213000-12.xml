 The English language paper is the     
{'Ammanford Guardian'}a paper of long  
 standing which covers news within the 
{Amman Valley. }A more reent addition  
 to the area is the{Welsh}language     
 paper{'Glo Man'(Small Coal).}It is    
 a monthly publication which is paid   
 for by 'Clwb y Cnape' an organisation 
 formed to fund the local paper.  All  
 contributions to the paper are given  
 free of charge thereby enabling the   
 publication to be sold for 40 pence   
 per month.  This local paper is very  
 popular with the older people of the  
 community.
