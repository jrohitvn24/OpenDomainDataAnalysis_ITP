		<content> All the farmers receive government    
 hillfarm subsidy. They concentrate on 
 rearing cattle and sheep, and growing 
 cereals, roots and grass for animal   
 feed. Stowe Farm, 560 acres, is rented
 from the Stanage Estate and worked by 
 a family plus hired labour. They keep 
 1200 sheep (Kerry and cross breed) 130
 calves and grow 80 acres of barley.   
 The rest is pasture, rough grazing and
 woodland. Stud Farm, 205 acres, is    
 owned freehold and run by a father and
 two sons. They keep 323 ewes, 10 rams,
 43 Friesian/Hereford cross cattle for 
 fattening plus one for milk and 10    
 hens for eggs. They grow 30 acres     
 barley, 5 oats, 10 swedes, 110 acres  
 pasture and 50 acres scrub and oak    
 woodland. Upper Lurkenhope and Garn   
 Bank Farms follow a similar farming   
 pattern and all sell stock in Knighton
 Market.                               </content>
