		<title>08Community life in New Hedges</title>
		<content> We interviewed an elderly resident who
 has witnessed the changes in community
 life within New Hedges village.       
        The village has changed        
 considerably over the last seventy    
 years.Originally it was a close knit  
 farming community , composed of twelve
 farmsteads,and twelve cottages for the
 farm workers and their families.Now   
 the number of buildings and residents 
 has increased considerably;but there  
 only remains four of the original     
 farms.                                
 The New Hedges By_pass has helped     
 enormously to sustain village life no 
 longer is the village divided by a    
 constant stream of traffic.           
 The once thriving farms have directed 
 their interests to tourism,developing 
 their land as suitable caravan and    
 camping Parks.The village is retaining
 it's community spirit which is vital. </content>
