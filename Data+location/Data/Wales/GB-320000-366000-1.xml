		<content>{A typical weekend for Richard Baker,  
{Farm Boy. }                           
  I wake up at 8.30 a.m. and get       
 dressed into my jeans and a T-shirt. I
 hurry downstairs to have my breakfast.
 I have cornflakes and toast on a      
 Saturday and Sunday. After breakfast I
 go out to see to my bantams and chicks
 then I have to clean my show bantams  
 out. Then I have to go and help my dad
 feed the cows in the fields. First we 
 go to a place called the "Quarry"     
 where we have about 30 acres of land. 
 We have about 50 cattle there and we  
 also store hay and straw in a building
 near the Quarry house. After that we  
 go up to Rhosesmor. We have about 20  
 acres there to check then we go back  
 to the farm for dinner. We usually    
 have crackers and cheese for dinner at
 night.                                
                                       </content>
