		<title>15TIDENHAM CHASE CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The land on which this church was    
 built was given by the owner of Chase 
 Farm who later became the church's    
 first organist.She was succeeded in   
 the post by her friend,Miss Grace,    
 who's name has been given to the lane 
 which leads to the otherwise isolated 
 farms.The present organist is only the
 fourth holder of the post.            
  The church,although built of stone   
 and giving the appearance of age,is   
 thought to be little more than a      
 hundred years old but there is no     
 record of when it was built or dates  
 of past vicars.The church is of the   
 Church of England and shares its vicar
 with two churches in the neighbouring 
 area,Tidenham and Tutshill.           
  The earliest gravestone to be found  
 in the church is eighty years old     
 and,as the area is so sparsely        
 populated,burial continues.           </content>
