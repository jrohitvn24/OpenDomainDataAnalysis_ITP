		<content> IN THE PAST RHONDDA WAS A STRONGHOLD  
 FOR CHRISTIANITY.WELSH AND ENGLISH    
 CHAPELS SPRANG UP EVERYWHERE.1904     
 BROUGHT REVIVAL TO THE VALLEY.        
 DEPOPULATION AND A GENERAL DECLINE IN 
 CHAPEL ATTENDANCES HAS NOW LED TO THE 
 CLOSURE AND DEMOLITION OF MANY        
 CHAPELS.THE REMAINING CHAPELS HAVE A  
 NUCLEUS OF MEMBERS STRUGGLING TO      
 SURVIVE.SOME CHURCHES ARE STRONGER    
 THAN OTHERS EG. ST. MATTHEW'S CHURCH  
 AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAVE INCREASED
 IN NUMBER .FOUR BAPTIST CHURCHES HAVE 
 FORMED THE UPPER RHONDDA GROUP OF     
 BAPTIST CHURCHES _UNDER ONE           
 MINISTER.DISILLUSIONED WITH MODERN    
 LIFE,PEOPLE ARE SLOWLY RETURNING TO   
 THE CHURCH,EG.THE ABOVE GROUP HAD 8   
 BAPTISMS RECENTLY.THERE IS A FEELING  
 THAT REVIVAL MAY WELL BE ON THE       
 WAY,ONCE AGAIN.
