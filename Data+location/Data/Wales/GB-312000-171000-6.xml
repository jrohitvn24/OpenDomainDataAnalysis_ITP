		<title>06The Church Of Saint Andras</title>
		<content> There has been a place of Christian   
 worship on the site since the         
 Thirteenth Century.   Parts of the    
 church are Norman, Tudor, Victorian,  
 and Modern.                           
 The dominant feature of the churchyard
 is the Preaching Cross.   This was    
 only recently restored after having   
 been seized by the Roundheads in the  
 Seventeenth Century.                  
 The area is predominantly rural and is
 sparsely populated, but the church is 
 highly active with a congregation of  
 twenty-five.                          
 The church is the main feature of the 
 hamlet, both historically and         
 socially.                             
 The local school is a church school   
 and the children form a choir monthly,
 which keeps the religion alive in the 
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
