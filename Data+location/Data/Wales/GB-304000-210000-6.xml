  The steam engines at Pontsticill come
 from all over the world.There are some
 from West Germany,East Germany and    
 also South Africa.One of the West     
 German one's is called Graf Schwerin- 
 Lowitz, built in 1908 this is the     
 one used most often on the railway.   
 Sybil was built in Leeds in 1903 and  
 was used in a slate quarry in North   
 Wales.                                
     The next steam engine hopefully to
 be acquired was built in Philadelehia 
 USA in 1930 for the eastern Province  
 Cement Co.Near Port Elizabeth and is a
 Baldwin 4_6_2,"Pacific".
