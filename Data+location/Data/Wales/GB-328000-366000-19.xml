		<content> Mr Jenkins is the school caretaker. He
 has lived in the same house in Ewloe  
 for 30 years. The greatest change he  
 has seen has been the number of houses
 built. Carlines Park Estate &amp; Penarlag
 school are built on what was          
 farmland.Wopod Lane used to have 25   
 cottages but now has 2000 houses. Mr  
 Jenkins can remember {steam trains }  
 passing down the disused track at the 
 side of the school playing field.     
 Almost every home today has a washing 
 machine.Mr Jenkins can remember his   
 mother &amp; wife using a{dolly tub}.The  
 washing was put in a big tub and a {  
{dolly }was used to work it around, it 
 was wrung by hand and then put out to 
 dry. Going to the cinema was very     
 popular, people had to queue form 1730
 hrs to get in at 1830 hrs. Now        
 television seems to be the most       
 popular entertainment.                </content>
