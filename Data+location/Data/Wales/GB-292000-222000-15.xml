		<content> Because the valley lies within the    
 National Park and is an attractive    
 part of it, the area has tourist      
 potential.                            
 However there are no hotels within the
 area and, indeed, only one farm offers
 bed-and-breakfast accommodation to    
 visitors.  Moreover there are no      
 public transport services whatsoever. 
 It follows that,apart from those using
 their cottages, the only visitors who 
 come to this area are passing through 
 and may stop for a picnic.            
 Some walkers visit the area but,      
 because there is only limited access  
 to the mountains here, this is not an 
 important activity.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
