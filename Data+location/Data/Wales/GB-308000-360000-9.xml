		<content> Rhewl village houses some 200 people  
 in all.Some 60% live on the Council   
 Estate built in the '50's; the rest in
 private dwellings.The Post Office     
 includes the only shop.No other       
 amenities exist to date besides       
 recreational ones.Llanynys hamlet     
 houses some 120 without amenity.      
  Housing conditions are good- older   
 properties having been improved, often
 with Council Grant aid.Many of the    
 once humble rural cottages have been  
 modernised,and command prices beyond  
 the reach of most local people, who   
 are left with the choice of waiting   
 for a council house to become vacant  
 or moving to Town.Some of the larger  
 farms have tied cottages for their    
 employees.The occasional cottage is a 
 second home,thus contributing very    
 little to the community.
