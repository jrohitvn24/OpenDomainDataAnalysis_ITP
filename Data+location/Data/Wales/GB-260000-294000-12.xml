		<title>12ABERDYFI LIFEBOAT STATION</title>
		<content>    Aberdyfi was a busy port in the mid
 nineteenth century with its own       
 lifeboat station.Established in 1850  
 the station was located in a special  
 building in Penhelig.This building is 
 now part of a garage.The wooden       
 slipway still leads down to the waters
 edge.Between 1850 and when it closed  
 in 1931 there were 31 launches and 51 
 lives saved.                          
    An inshore rescue boat was housed  
 in part of the old wharf buildings in 
 1963.Today the station is manned by   
 villagers and staff from the Outward  
 Bound Sea School.                     
    The present lifeboat is called out 
 approximately 30 times per year making
 an average of 12/13 rescues.Tourists  
 using an assortment of canoes,        
 dinghies,inflatables and more recently
 sail boards provide the majority of   
 today's incidents.                    </content>
