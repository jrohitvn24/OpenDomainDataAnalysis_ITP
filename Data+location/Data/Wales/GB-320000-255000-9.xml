		<title>09GWAITHLA FARM GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> Our farm is called 'Gwaithla'. It is  
 about 330 acres. It was once five     
 separate farms. These farms were      
 called Gwaithla, Cefn-hir, Lower      
 Cwmeinon, Lower Gwaithla, and Derw.   
 Some of the buildings are old and some
 are new. On the whole farm there are  
 thirteen barns.They are used for      
 storing hay and keeping animals in.   
 The buildings are not all in the same 
 place. At the Derw we have a big new  
 shed where the hay and straw is kept. 
 In the old buildings at the Derw we do
 shearing and dipping. The sileage     
 clamp is there as well. There is      
 nothing left of Cwmeinon. We let      
 Cefn-Hir house for holidays. The stock
 that we have is sheep and cattle.Up at
 Cefn-Hir the ground is a steepish, but
 down at Gwaithla it is fairly level.  
 We also have rights to keep sheep on  
 Caety Traelow, the hill behind us.    </content>
