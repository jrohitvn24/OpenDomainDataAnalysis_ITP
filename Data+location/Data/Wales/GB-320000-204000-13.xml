 rugby and football matches by small   
 local clubs and in two cases a        
 childrens' play area is on the same   
 site.A third play area is near the new

 play areas have the usual swings,     
 slides and roundabouts.               
 The main entertainment facility within
 this section is the {'Metropole'}
