		<content> There is little  evidence of pollution
 generally, but some accidental fouling
 of the  streams   does  occur  due  to
 overflowing slurry pits, but the local
 farmers have taken  steps  to  control
 this  in  recent  years.  The district
 abounds in oak trees, also  two  Scots
 pines are growing  between   Crosswell
 and Rhydygwydd,and a fine beech by the
 road below Tirmynnydd.                
{Bird life}is prolific, buzzards,herons
 sparrowhawks and barn owls   are often
 seen,and a Marsh Harrier was   seen on
 two occasions this summer.
