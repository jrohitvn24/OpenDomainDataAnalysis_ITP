 to Bridgend which is twenty miles west
 of Cardiff. It mainly consists of     
 houses and shops although there are

 areas. Pencoed has the usual small    
 town facilities, such as parks,       
 swimming pools, banks, petrol filling 
 stations, dentists and doctor's       
 surgeries. There is a railway track   
 running through the centre of town    
 which often causes a build up of      
 traffic when the crossing gates are   
 closed. There are two primary schools 
 and one comprehensive school in the   
 locality. The area also includes the  
 villages of{Brynna}and{Llanharan.     
 Llanharan is dominated by a huge      
 open-cast colliery, although the      
 village contains shops, houses and a  
 primary school which caters for       
 children who speak Welsh and English. </content>
