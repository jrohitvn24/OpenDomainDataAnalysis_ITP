{by Paul Herridge and Huw Davies.      
 Brynithel is a fairly large and close 
 knit community.The Mount Pleasant and 
 Penrhiw Estates make up Brynithel.    
 There are two general stores the      
 Spar,and Hammonds.We also have a      
 fishshop and a PostOffice.There are   
 three public bars one in Mount        
 Pleasant,one on Cemetery Road and one 
 near ST. Illtyds Church.We have a     
 community centre which is used for    
 bingo,dancing and on Sundays Chapel is
 held there.There is a youth club held 
 up at the local football field and    
 also one held in Tyr Graig            
 School.Apart from youth club there    
 is not much for the children of       
 Brynithel to do.There is a park but   
 without any swings.The nearest park or
 playground is in Aberbeeg or          
 Llanhilleth.                          </content>
