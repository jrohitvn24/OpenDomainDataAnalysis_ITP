		<title>15GALA WEEK ,THREE CROSSES</title>
		<content>  The School Parents' Association      
 organised a series of events during   
 this week to raise funds to purchase  
 equipment for use in the School.      
        Helping to create a carnival   
 atmosphere in the village were such   
 events as a pram race for adults,a    
 sports evening, football competition, 
 treasure hunt,disco and,finally,to    
 conclude the proceedings,a fete held  
 in the School playground.One thousand 
 six hundred pounds was raised but what
 was perhaps more important was the    
 community spirit which was again      
 aroused.
