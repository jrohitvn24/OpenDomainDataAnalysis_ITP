  Our Domesday patch lies south-west of
 Newtown,in mid-Wales.It stretches from
 the river{Severn}in the valley to     
 within one kilometre of the{hill      
{village}of Dolfor.Most of these hills 
 are just over 300 metres.We think that
 a thousand years ago,when the first   
 survey was made,this part of Wales was
 covered in forests and thinly         
 populated.Today it is surprising how  
 much it has changed.In the Mochdre    
 Industrial Estate can be found        
 thirty factories;there is a large     
 sports centre,three schools,a         
 college with a theatre,a college farm 
 with a nature trail,two chapels and   
 much more.On the hills are several    
 farms keeping sheep,mainly.It is a    
 beautiful part of Wales;unfortunately 
 there is a lot of{unemployment}in our 
 Domesday area.{                       </content>
