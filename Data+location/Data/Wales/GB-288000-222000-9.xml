		<title>09FARMING,ACCESS TO CNEWR LAND</title>
		<content> Although the land belonging to Cnewr  
 Estates Ltd. extends over the water-  
 shed and the escarpment of the Brecon 
 Beacons including the two summits     
 FAN NEDD and FAN GIHIRYCH it is never 
 -theless enclosed farm land and not   
 open to the public for walking.       
 An agreement made in 1980 allows for  
 public access by means of a path which
 traverses the high land, taking in    
 these summits.  Access to the land is 
 still prohibited during the lambing   
 season (15th April to 10th May) and   
 in times of prolonged dry weather.    
 This prohibition results from a       
 disastrous moorland fire during the   
 prolonged drought of 1976 when the    
 peat soil of the land to the south of 
 Fan Gihirych was entirely stripped    
 away by fire. The fire had, in fact,  
 been started by lightning.
