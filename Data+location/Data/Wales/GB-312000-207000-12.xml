		<title>12COUNTRY PARK - BRYN BACH</title>
		<content>                                       
 Bryn Bach Country Park is a large park
on the outskirts of Tredegar. It was   
an  open-cast mine, the large craters  
have been lined with plastic and then  
filled with water.  They contain many  
fish and provide opportunity for many  
different water sports - sailing,      
skiing, windsurfing and fishing.  The  
park is on a bleak mountain-side, it   
rains there often. There are many      
footpaths for people to use, running   
across from Tredegar to Rhymney.  The  
park is for people to use, it will     
have an air strip and hangers, there   
will be a hotel and a camp site.       
Local school children have planted     
many different kinds of trees in the   
park.  There are many different wild   
plants that must not be picked.
