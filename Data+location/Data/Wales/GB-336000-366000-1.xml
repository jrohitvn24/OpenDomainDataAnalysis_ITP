   This D-Block includes all of Blacon,
 which is a suburb of Chester mainly   
 providing a housing area for the city.
 With its high-rise flats, community   
 centre, small shopping precincts and  
 other typical modern ammenities, it   
 surprises many that Blacon was in the 
 Domesday Survey of 1086 (as Blachehol 
 a farming area and fishery).          
   Over 3kms of the England/North Wales
 border passes through the D-Block     
 roughly following the old course of   
 The River Dee. This land bordering the
 aptly names Sealand Road leading from 
 Chester into Wales is mainly reclaimed
 land used for farming except for the  
 thriving Sealand Industrial Estate.   
   Two kms of tidal Dee waters,        
 re-routed in 1735-6, flow within the  
 D-Block, as well as about 2kms of the 
 Shropshire Union Canal.               </content>
