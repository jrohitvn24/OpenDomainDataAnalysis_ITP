		<title>12PENTRE CONTROLLED SCHOOL</title>
		<content> THIS IS A SMALL VILLAGE SCHOOL WITH   
 ONLY 31 CHILDREN FROM 4 TO 11 YEARS.  
 THE BUILDING IS ABOUT 150 YEARS OLD   
 AND IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS A CHURCH.  
 IT ISN'T A CHURCH ANY MORE, BUT THE   
 SCHOOL STILL HAS CONNECTIONS WITH     
 ST. MARY'S CHURCH IN CHIRK. THERE ARE 
 ONLY TWO CHILDREN OF PRIMARY SCHOOL   
 AGE IN THE VILLAGE, ALL THE OTHER     
 CHILDREN COME TO SCHOOL IN CARS OR ON 
 A BUS. IN THE PAST SOME CHILDREN HAD  
 TO WALK 2 MILES TO SCHOOL THROUGH     
 HALTON WOOD. IF THEY WERE LATE THEY   
 WOULD SOMETIMES GET CANED.NO-ONE GETS 
 CANED NOW, BUT SOMETIMES THE CHILDREN 
 ARE STILL NAUGHTY. THE SCHOOL IS A    
 HAPPY ONE.THERE ARE ONLY TWO TEACHERS.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
