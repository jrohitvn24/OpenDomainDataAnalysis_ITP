 school a long time ago.Now the village
 hall is used for the youth club,guides
 ,brownies,play group,jumble sales and

  The  youth club is used once a week. 
 They have darts, snooker, pool and    
 music.In the play group it is used    
 every morning.The jumble sales are    
 sometimes in the summer and sometimes 
 in the winter.People bring allsorts   
 to be sold and when everything is sold
 the money is collected and counted and
 put towards the hall.Every Monday     
 in the village hall they have bingo.  
 If there is a holiday like Bank       
 Holiday Monday or Christmas there is  
 no bingo.In bingo they have raffles.  
 Some people bring things for the      
 raffle.At Christmas they have a big   
 raffle and there are lots of things   
 brought in.                           </content>
