		<content> The area is dotted with small cottages
 and farms, many of which have been    
 purchased and used as holiday         
 retreats.  Farmhouse accommodation for
 the holidaying public is also much in 
 evidence.  Many of the cottages, which
 were bought for holidays originaly are
 not being used as permanent homes as  
 their owners are finding themselves   
 prematurely out of work and retired   
 from their places of employment or    
 made redundant by this Conservative   
 government's economic measures.  This 
 is bringing the younder people back   
 into the area with children and thus  
 reversing the trend of years ago when 
 the young were leaving the land to    
 work in the Cities.  Rundown farms and
 smallholding are being modernised by  
 both the Welsh and English and being  
 farmed again by these people trying to
 make a new lifestyle.                 </content>
