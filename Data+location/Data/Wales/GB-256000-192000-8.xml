		<content>{Community Centre.}The original wooden 
 building was built by unemployed men  
 of the area,under the auspices of the 
 South Wales School of Social Services,
 during the depression in the 1930's.  
 This building was destroyed by fire   
 and replaced by a modern structure in 
 1977.The new Centre offers more       
 facilities and is used by several     
 local organisations including the     
 Women's Institute,karate and dance    
 clubs.Badminton is played in the main 
 hall which also has a large stage on  
 which plays and pantomimes are        
 performed by local groups.            
{Clyne Valley Country Park.}This newly 
 established park enables the people of
 Dunvant and Killay to enjoy a pleasant
 tree-lined walk to Swansea Bay,three  
 miles away.The path,for cyclists and  
 pedestrians,is built on the route of  
 the railway line which closed in 1962.</content>
