		<content> Although most people come to{Grosmont 
 to see the{castle}and the{church}they 
 find there are a lot more interests to
 see in our village.The stone castle is
 built on the site of an earlier wooden
{Motte and Bailey castle.              
 It has a large ditch around it.There  
 is a Great Hall inside and towers on  
 most of the corners.The castle has    
 been a ruin for years but at one point
 you can climb up to the very top of a 
 wall.One of the most attractive things
 about the castle is the chimney which 
 is still complete with its carved     
 stone decorations.{St.Nicholas' Church
 was built by{Hubert De Burg}at the    
 same time as the castle under the     
 order of{Queen Eleanor}.Since the     
 Victorian Restoration the Old Nave,   
 which is is paved with grave stones is
 not in use for services.Pamphlets     
 about both buildings are available.   </content>
