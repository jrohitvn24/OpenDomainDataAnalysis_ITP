		<content>  I am 4. My favourite toy is a{plastic
{cookery set.} It has a teapot,        
 saucepan, cooker and frying pan.      
  I am 5. I play with a{toy pony}that  
 has a coloured mane and tail.         
  I am 6. I like a fluffy{clockwork    
{monkey}that plays "Rock a bye baby".  
  I am 7. My favourite toy is a life   
 like new-born{baby doll.              
  I am 8 and I like playing with a     
{Sindy doll}which you can dress up. She
 is like a human because she has lots  
 of things that humans have.           
  I am 9. I like a{baby-crawl-away}that
 runs off batteries and wiggles her    
 bottom as she moves along.            
  I'm 10. My favourite toy is a dapple 
 grey{rocking horse}on an oak base.    
  I am 11 and my best toy is a{teddy   
{bear}called Hug Me. I take him to bed 
 with me because he's lovely.
