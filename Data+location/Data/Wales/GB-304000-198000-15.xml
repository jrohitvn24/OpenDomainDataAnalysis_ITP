		<title>15POPULATION IN MOUNTAIN ASH</title>
		<content> The population in Mountain Ash is in  
 steady decline.This is clearly shown  
 by the falling roles in our schools.It
 has become a steadily ageing          
 population.{Since 1951 the population 
{has dropped by as much as 18 per cent.
 The number at present is only 15,418. 
                                       
 The closure of the Deep Duffryn       
 Colliery in 1980 saw the end of       
 mining in the town and the loss of    
 even more of the population.This lack 
 of industry in the town and the Cynon 
 Valley as a whole has meant yonger    
 people leaving the area in search of  
 employment elsewhere.                 
                                       
 Mountain Ash is now more or less a    
 dormitory town with almost the entire 
 working population employed somewhere 
 else.
