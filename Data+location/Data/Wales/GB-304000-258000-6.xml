		<content> to the present day.In addition to     
 post-war council housing at the       
 southern end of the village there is  
 a recent housing development designed 
 to meet the needs of the elderly.     
  The ground floors of some of the     
 larger Victorian houses have been     
 converted into shops.There was one    
 purpose-built Edwardian shop in the   
 Ridgebourne now sadly modernised      
 called the Grosvenor Store.There is   
 an excellent example of inter-war     
 architecture in the Automobile Palace 
 while the old 13Cth parish church on a
 hillock above the Lake is well worth a
 visit as is Old Hall Farm next door,a 
 fine example of a traditional Welsh   
 longhouse dating from the 16Cth.
