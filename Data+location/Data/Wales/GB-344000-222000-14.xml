		<title>14Garway Church Graveyard</title>
		<content> We collected information from the     
 gravestones at Garway Church. We wrote
 down the names and dates of 85 people.
 There are some more gravestones, but  
 we could not get at them because the  
 grass was too long, and they are badly
 worn down. Usually there are two or   
 three names on a gravestone. Though   
 the church is Norman, the earliest    
 date we found was 1764. There were    
 three 18th century dates, 24 from     
 the 19th century, and the rest from   
 this century. The oldest person lived 
 to be 95. There were 7 graves of      
 children. The most common surname was 
 Morgan, with 17, though none since    
 1907. There were 7 Barrells and 7     
 Benjamins. Both those names are very  
 common in the village now.
