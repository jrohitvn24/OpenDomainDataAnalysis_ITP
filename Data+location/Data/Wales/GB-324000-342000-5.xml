 is situated at the edge of Rhos-y-coed
 housing estate and serves the need for
 a population of approximately 2500    
 people.The centre is used by many     
 local organisations such as the{,Youth
{Club,Darts Club,Senior Citizens and   
{the local}school.Concerts and Bingo   
 Nights and rummage sales are also held
 there quite frequently.               
             The pupils of{Garth School
 use it to perform their annual        
{Christmas Concerts}and they are well  
 attended by parents and people from   
 the village.                          
             There is a{library room}at
 the centre and it is used by the      
 children quite a lot,but it is going  
 to be{closed owing to lack of money.  
         My dad says that it's a       
 disgrace and he is going to protest .
