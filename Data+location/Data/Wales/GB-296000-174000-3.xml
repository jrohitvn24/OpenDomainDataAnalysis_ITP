		<title>03Cowbridge Half Marathon</title>
		<content>  Ian Beard who was the first man to   
 complete the course said that the     
 course was tough. Paul Prosser who won
 the first under 16 award this year    
 came in at 1hr 30mins and 6secs.      
 Corris Thomas who is an ex-rugby union
 international referee came in after   
 1hr 31mins. Paul Morgan who is a pupil
 at Y Bont Faen School was one of the  
 youngest who entered came in at 2hrs. 
 All of the people who entered enjoyed 
 the marathon, although they had to pay
 Â£2:00 to enter which went to the fire 
 brigade and the famine relief of      
 Ethiopia. The competitors followed    
 this course: The fire station         
 (start/finish), down St.Mary Church   
 Road, turned right at Eglwys Brewis,  
 under the bridge at Llanmaes, past    
 Llandow warehouses and up to the fire 
 station at Druids Green, Cowbridge.
