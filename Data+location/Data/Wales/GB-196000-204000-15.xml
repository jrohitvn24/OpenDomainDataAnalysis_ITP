		<title>15FARMING IN BURTON (1)</title>
		<content>    Brompton Park is one of the most   
 important farms in our area. It is a  
{240 acres}mixed farm and the{main crop
 is{early potatoes.}The potatoes are   
 planted and harvested by machine which
 is a great advantage for faster work  
 - two men can plant{70 acres}a        
 day. When the potatoes are harvested, 
 they are sold in the{Midlands,        
{Liverpool}and{Manchester.             
   Other vegetables grown are{cabbages,
{swedes and cauliflowers,}which are    
 sold for Local Trade. The potatoes and
 other vegetables are irrigated by     
 sprinklers from four irrigation       
 reservoirs, constructed on the farm,  
 each holding{half a million}gallons.  
{Barley}is grown on 40 acres of land,  
 to feed animals. Some barley is used  
 on the farm but most is sold. The     
 straw is not burnt, as on some farms, 
 but it is used for bedding calves.    </content>
