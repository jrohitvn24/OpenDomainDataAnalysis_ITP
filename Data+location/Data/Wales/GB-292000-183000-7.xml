		<content>  Most people have four meals a day,{  
{breakfast,dinner,tea and supper.}     
  For many {breakfast}consists of      
 cereals or toast with marmalade or jam
 and a cup of tea. Some however enjoy  
 bacon and egg with beans and sausages.
{ Dinner,}eaten at mid-day, is varied. 
 On Sunday most have roast meat,       
 vegetables,gravy followed by a sweet. 
  On Weekdays it could be egg and      
 chips,sausage and chips,fish and chips
 or a roast dinner.                    
  Tea is always a light meal of        
 sandwiches or bread and butter with   
 cake or biscuits followed by tea or   
 coffee.                               
{ Supper }can either be a light or     
 heavy meal. Many do not eat{supper }  
 because it is not good to eat a meal  
 before going to bed. A drink is       
 sufficient for me.
