		<content> Our area used to be farmland e.g:     
 Caereithin farm.There were also       
 collieries here e.g: Mynydd Newydd.   
  Before the big estates were built,the
 area developed along Linear lines.    
 Middle Road was built up in 1933 with 
 brick semi-detached houses.These      
 houses would have seven rooms.        
  People needed housing quickly after  
 the war.The council built             
 prefabricated houses for them.These   
 houses were in Fordd-y-Brain,Heol     
 Awstin and Rodfar Brain.              
  Council estates consisting of        
 terraced and semi detached were made  
 in 1953. They had tile roofs and metal
 windows. The houses have six rooms    
 inside.The area could have been better
 planned because there is not much open
 space.Maes-a-Felyn and Pant-yr-Helyg  
 are now open plan development
