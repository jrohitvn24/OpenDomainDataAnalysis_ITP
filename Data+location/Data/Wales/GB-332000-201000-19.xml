		<title>19LITTLE MILL SAWMILL</title>
		<content> The blacksmith's shop of 150years ago 
 developed into a carriage shop where  
 many local wheelwrights learned their 
 trade and now it is the sawmill.      
 The present owner who had had a fire  
 block round developed many contacts   
 for his present business.Having       
 abandoned the haulage side the cutting
 of the wood took over.Logs are sawn   
 with a 5ins.band saw into the right   
 sizes according to order.Both local   
 soft and old hardwoods are used.      
 First quality oak may be used as fence
 posts,planking and beams whilst second
 quality for industrial packaging,     
 chocks and coverboards.Other than     
 notching,the wood is left in plain    
 lengths.The sawdust is used to make   
 flakeboards and any waste for the     
 owner's fuel.The owner is proud to be 
 a selfmade businessman having started 
 with minimal capital.                 </content>
