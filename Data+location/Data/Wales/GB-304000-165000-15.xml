		<content> There are a number of concerns which  
 merit noting. They are, in the main,  
 typical village issues...             
 1) That there are not adequate bus    
 services connecting Rhoose with major 
 towns.                                
 2)That sending children to secondary  
 schools nine miles away cannot be     
 avoided but it is a problem           
 nonetheless.                          
 3)That there is a regular amount of   
 "fallout" emitted by the Aberthaw     
 Cement Works and Quarry which coats   
 anything (washing, cars etc.) left out
 overnight.                            
 4)That local council provision for    
 amenities etc. is dictated by the     
 amount of money provided by the Vale  
 of Glamorgan Borough Council and that 
 this council has not enough interest  
 in the outlying areas such as Rhoose.
