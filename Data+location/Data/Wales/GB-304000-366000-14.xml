		<title>14AGED IN DENBIGH.</title>
		<content> With advances in medical care many    
 people are enjoying a greater life    
 span.Oldage does present problems and 
 the people of Denbigh are helped by a 
 number of voluntary organisations e.g.
{meals on wheels,W.R.V.S. }as well     
 as having a day centre at Eirianfa.   
 The public sector has provided        
 accomodation for the more needy at    
 Dolwen old peoples home and sheltered 
 housing at Cysgodfa.{Private nursing  
 and rest homes have increased recently
 and there is concern that some might  
 be exploiting the aged.               
         At Wynne's Park,a private     
 establishment,residents are provided  
 with their "own" self-contained       
 bungalow.Qualified  nursing staff are 
 permanently in attendance.Residents   
 therefore maintain a sense of         
 independence and dignity.
