		<title>10DIALYSING (3) LITTLE MILL</title>
		<content> The effect on my eldest child was more
 noticeable than on my younger one.The 
 youngest had grown up with my renal   
 failure and knew no other way of life 
 for me.My eldest was 8 years when I   
 fell ill,old enough to know that I    
 nearly died when I first started      
 dialysis and could remember life prior
 to the machine days.The machine and   
 way of life causes stress amongst the 
 family.My husband has been a constant 
 "tower of strength" for me.           
 I rely on water,electricity,specialist
 medical staff,high technology and     
 technicians and a stable home         
 situation to survive. However one can 
 live with these conditions and will   
 strive to survive because is an inborn
 characteristic.                       
 I have lived in this way for 11 years 
 and hope to live to have a successful 
 transplant and return to normal life. </content>
