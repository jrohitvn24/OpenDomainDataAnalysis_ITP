		<title>18Rugby and Soccer in Swansea</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 Two major features of sport in Swansea
 are rugby and soccer.                 
{Swansea RFC}is known as the{'All      
{Whites'}because of its kit.  It       
 plays at St.Helens ground. It is      
 considered one of the major teams in  
 Wales.  It has won the major Welsh    
 rugby team prize as well as providing 
 players for the national XV.          
 The{soccer team}is known as the       
{'Swans'.} It is not as lucky as the   
 rugby team.  It has lost a lot of     
 support in its slide from the 1st to  
 3rd divisions.  It looks as if it     
 will not be playing at the beginning  
 of next season because of financial   
 difficulties.  This is a great pity   
 since it is one of only 4 Welsh teams 
 in the Football League and it is a    
 side which has produced great players.</content>
