		<content>{Day in the life of Martin Davies,}    
  August 17th 1984                     
       My day started early at 7.30 am.
 I went out to suckle 4 'Charolais'    
 calves(a French breed introduced some 
 years ago), on 2 Hereford and Friesian
 cows. I then fed the Hereford bull, a 
 specail  interest of mine. As soon as 
 the dew  lifted  we were  combining 7 
 acres of spring Barley  variety kym. I
 then  cleared  30  sacks  which  would
 be  required  for seed   next year.Our
 Massey  Ferguson  combine  was working
 quickly.  The corn bin at the farm was
 almost  full, so I then had to level  
  corn  as  it  came  out of the auger.
     We started bailing straw, which   
 was left behind the combine. I stacked
 the straw bails into flat eights,which
 were loaded onto the trailer. At the  
 end of the day 759 bails were stacked.
