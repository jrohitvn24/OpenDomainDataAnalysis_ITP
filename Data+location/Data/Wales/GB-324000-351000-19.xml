		<content> The School was founded and scheduled  
 for opening in 1874, hence the date   
 MDCCCLXXIV incorporated in the        
 brickwork of the building. It appears,
 however, that it was actually opened  
 on June 7th 1875. When the School was 
 opened all the pupils and adults had  
 to speak English because all education
 was conducted in English. The home    
 language of most pupils was Welsh     
 however.Recorded in the log books are 
 some unusual occurences including     
 several cases of snow in June(due to  
 the fact that the village is at 1150  
 feet above sea-level).                
 The present headteacher is Mr. G.W.   
 Jones. There are four classes which   
 are Infants taught by the Deputy Mrs. 
 G. Wood, 1st and 2nd year juniors     
 taught by Mrs. J. Burke, Nursery      
 taught by Mrs. J. Williams and 3rd and
 4th year juniors taught by the Head.  </content>
