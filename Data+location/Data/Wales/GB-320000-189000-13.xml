		<title>13Working Men's Libraries</title>
		<content>  There is still the remnant of a      
 large library in Crosskeys Miners'    
 Institute. The majority of the books  
 were transferred to University College
 Swansea in the early 1970's where they
 joined the libraries of many other    
 valley "stutes". Crosskeys "stute",   
 built in 1910, has a reading room,    
 a games room and a billiards room. In 
 its heyday though, local miners used  
 the library avidly often reading heavy
 economics texts as well as literary   
 classics. The "stute" was also used   
 for evening classes in Economics and  
 Sociology. Today, the literary        
 function of the "stute" has largely   
 been replaced by the screening of     
 video films, suggesting perhaps that  
 the institutes no longer function as  
 an educational, as well as an         
 entertainment and social, centre for  
 the community.                        </content>
