		<content> This is a childrens hospital. Children
 aged 6 months to 16 years go to the   
 hospital if they need their tonsils   
 taken out. When they have infected    
 tonsils and adenoids often they cannot
 breathe or hear very well. Sometimes  
 they go quite deaf. There are 28 beds 
 in the hospital but when we visited   
 there were only 4 children in them    
 waiting for operations. Usually the   
 children only stay in for about two   
 weeks. In each ward there are         
 television sets and books for the     
 children. There are two wards and one 
 playroom where we saw a boy painting. 
 There is also a room for the mums to  
 stay in, vandals have broken some     
 windows in this room. The Matron told 
 us the hospital might have to close   
 down because of the damage the vandals
 do, they do not have money to keep    
 repairing things.         cont.       </content>
