		<content> Farming is the main economic activity 
 in the block.Almost all the farms are 
 owner-occupied family farms of medium 
 size (100to200 acres).The farms       
 specialise in livestock rearing with  
 cattle and sheep equally important.   
 Farming is based on the use of grass  
 for fodder as few other crops are     
 grown.The is grazed in the summer and 
 also provides the main bulk of winter 
 fodder in the form of hay and silage. 
 Because of the vagaries of the climate
 silage is now more important than hay.
 The farms are highly mechanised and   
 the use of forage harvesters has led  
 to a larger number of bigger tractors 
 being used. Some of the harvesting is 
 carried out by contractors.
