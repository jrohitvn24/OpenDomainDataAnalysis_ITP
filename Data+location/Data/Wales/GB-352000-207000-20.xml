		<title>20NEWLAND WITH REDBROOK</title>
		<content> In this parish the population of{     
{Redbrook}increased with the develop-  
 ment of the tin-plate works, the brew-
 ery and the boats on the river. As    
 a result of this the{Church of St.    
{Saviour}and{Redbrook C. of E. School  
 were built and opened in 1874. The    
 school then admitted Newland and Red- 
 brook children. The church and school 
 have always worked closely together   
 and it is hoped that this will        
 continue.                             
 The Church at Redbrook has also been  
 restored over the last few years. It  
 is now used for all sorts of events:  
 fetes, bazaars, school events and     
 concerts. Above all the church is for 
 local people to use: to sit and be    
 quiet, to pray, to join in some event,
 to meet people, to give thanks, to re-
 member, to sing and to worship. In a  
 way it is the soul of the village.    </content>
