		<title>05THE SUN CENTRE, RHYL</title>
		<content>  The Sun Centre, opened by Stuart Hall
 in 1980, cost Â£4,250,000 when it      
 should only have cost Â£1,250,000.     
 There is a heated pool with waves and 
 something more adventurous is the     
 surfing pool which is Europe's first  
 indoor surfing pool. If you want to   
 relax there is a choice of lying on a 
 sunbed or sitting at a table with a   
 drink as there is a bar with anything 
 from orange squash to spirits. If you 
 want to look down on things go up in a
 cable car which travels around the    
 roof of the building. For the children
 there is a dragon slide, elephant     
 slide, octopus slide and a bumpy      
 slide. Even the smallest children can 
 enjoy themselves as there is a small  
 pool with imitation animals for them  
 to climb over.
