		<content> IN MY SPARE TIME I MOSTLY WATCH       
 TELEVISION. MY FIRST CHOICE IS "TOP OF
 THE POPS". IT IS A GOOD PROGRAMME TO  
 SEE WHAT THE SONGS OF THE GROUPS ARE  
 LIKE. IT IS PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT DJ'S
 EVERYWEEK. MY SECOND CHOICE IS THE    
 "TUBE". IT IS ALSO ABOUT POP MUSIC BUT
 IT IS BETTER BECAUSE THE GROUPS ARE   
 ALWAYS LIVE IN THE STUDIO AND IT IS   
 PRESENTED BY JOOLS HOLLAND AND LESLEY 
 ASH. MY THIRD CHOICE IS "JUST GOOD    
 FRIENDS" WHICH IS ABOUT TWO           
 ADULTS,PENNY AND VINCENT WHO WERE     
 GOING TO MARRY BUT HE DIDN'T TURN UP  
 FOR THE WEDDING. THEY DID NOT SEE EACH
 OTHER FOR FIVE YEARS AND ARE NOW      
 TRYING TO BE GOOD FRIENDS AGAIN. MY   
 LAST CHOICE IS "IN SICKNESS AND IN    
 HEALTH" AND IS ABOUT TWO PEOPLE WHO   
 ARE GROWIING OLD.
