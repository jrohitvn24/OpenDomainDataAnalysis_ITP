		<content> This church in Danescourt is over 100 
 yrs old, but there was no regular     
 vicar here in the 19th century. The   
 vicar now is Rev. W. G. Barlow and he 
 has been here for 3 yrs. He is also   
 vicar of Christ Church, Radyr Chain.  
 There are regular services every      
 Sunday, and sometimes in the evenings 
 on weekdays. The average congragation 
 for the 9:15 am Eucharist service on  
 Sundays is about 70. Other services   
 held here are Eucharists on Saints    
 days, marriages, baptisms, and        
 funerals, but confirmations take place
 at Christ Church because there are so 
 many candidates. The parents of the   
 writer, Roald Dahl, are buried in the 
 churchyard.
