		<content> The coastline comprises of{limestone  
{cliffs and areas of sand, shingle and 
{pebble.                               
 Due to the limestone there has been   
 over the years a large amount of      
 quarrying on the coastline. There is  
 evidence of worked out quarries  at   
 various points. The{cement/asbestos   
 works to the south of Rhose which were
 set up to use the raw material from   
 the quarries is no now longer used.   
 However, the area surrounding it has  
 developed into a small industrial     
 estate. This house various light      
 industries, for instance a garden     
 fence manufacturer, vehicle salvage   
 company etc.                          
 Further to the East and West of this  
 site are two caravan sites which hold 
 permanent mobile homes.
