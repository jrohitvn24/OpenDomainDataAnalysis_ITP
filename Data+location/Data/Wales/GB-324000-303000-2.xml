		<title>02Leighton Hall</title>
		<content>     A mid-victorian mansion built for 
 a banker is now for sale.There was    
 once an old Tudor hall on the same    
 site.Leighton hall was owned by an    
 American senator,and it was recently  
 used for television films e.g.Blott on
 the landscape, and East Lynne.        
       This beautiful Hall was once    
 used as a private school.Its interior 
 has decorated woodwork,carved         
 ceilings,marble sculptures,galleries  
 and chandeliers.No expense was spared 
 when it was built.It was designed by  
 the architect W.H. Gee,and the        
 interior by Pugin.There is a 100 foot 
 carillon tower in this listed         
 building.The grounds are well-kept    
 still,and we went to the annual church
 fete held there last Saturday.This is 
 a pleasent and beautiful place.
