		<content> TRANSPORT                             
 THE ONLY PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS ONCE A   
 WEEK . A BUS RUNS FROM OSWESTRY       
 PASSING THROUGH A SMALL SECTION OF THE
 AREA . THE NEAREST DAILY BUS ROUTE IS 
 ABOUT 3KM AWAY FOR MOST PEOPLE . SO   
 THE ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORT IS BY     
 PRIVATE CAR . TWO OF THE ROAD BRIDGES 
 IN THE AREA WERE DAMAGED BY FLOOD TWO 
 YEARS AGO AND BAILY BRIDGES WERE      
 INSTALLED . ONE HAS BEEN REPLACED     
 RECENTLY BUT THE SECOND IS STILL IN   
 PLACE .                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
