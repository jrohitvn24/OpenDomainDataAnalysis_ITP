		<title>19Caldicot-Waghausel</title>
		<content> For more than ten years Caldicot has  
 had a twinning connection with a town 
 in Germany. The first contact was     
 with Wiesental near Heidleberg and    
 Bruchsal in South Germany. When       
 Germany underwent local government    
 boundary changes Wiesental joined with
 the villages of Kirlach and Waghausel.
    There are many exchanges made by   
 members of associations such as       
 youth clubs, sports clubs, choirs and 
 bands.                                
    Visitors from Germany stay with    
 local families in Caldicot and are    
 able to visit places of historic      
 interest and join in social events.   
    This arrangement has helped to     
 build up social, cultural and trade   
 relations between the people of       
 Caldicot and Waghausel.
