		<title>16CAPEL ED CHAPEL GOYTRE</title>
		<content>   The chapel was built in 1807.       
 Originally the Coedcae Farm stood on  
 the ground where the chapel is now.   
 Many years before the chapel was built
 the services were held in the kitchen 
 of the farmhouse.                     
   Capel Ed Chapel derived it's name   
 from{Joshua chapter 22 verse 34}      
 "...and the children of Gad called the
 altar Ed." For the first 70 years     
 there was no organ or piano so all the
 hymns were sung unaccompanied.At this 
 time one of the chapel stalwarts was  
 John Powell, who lived 4 miles away on
 the other side of the river Usk.      
 Undeterred by the fact that there     
 was no river crossing he provided     
 himself with a coracle and every      
 Sunday he would paddle his family     
 across.There was a special service to 
 celebrate the chapel's 175th year in  
 1982.{                                </content>
