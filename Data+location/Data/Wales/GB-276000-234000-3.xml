		<content>     The majority of people in this    
 block possess a{motor vechicle        
 (car,van or Land Rover).In our class  
 of 26 children 3 had no car and 1     
 parent had a motor bike .             
    For those wishing to use{Public    
{Services}there are{Trains}(page 2)    
 and{Buses.}A local company runs a bus 
 service to neighbouring villages.The  
 bus runs 3  times a day (except       
 sunday) to Llandeilo where connections
 can be caught to further destinations.
 There is a bus on a Friday to         
 Cynghordy and Rhandirmwyn. Some people
 also use the{School Bus service}to get
 to and from town.In our class we      
 discovered that 8 children had never  
 travelled on a service bus and one    
 never on a train.                     
   Each child has his own{bicycle}and 4
 have{motorbikes}to ride in the fields.
