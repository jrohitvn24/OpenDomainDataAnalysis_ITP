		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN CARMARTHEN</title>
		<content>             JOB CENTRE                
     We went down to the job centre in 
 Carmarthen to ask Mr.Evans questions. 
 The part time jobs are difficult t0   
 get.Nobody wants the catering jobs.You
 are most likely to get a job if you   
 are over 25-35.If you are over 50 it  
 is more difficult. Popular jobs are   
 clerical,labouring and shopwork and   
 about 150-200 people come in each week
 to look for a job.                    
    The average unemployment rate in   
 the Carmarthen area is 9.2% but it is 
 about 15% nationally.                 
  Often the first person to apply for a
 job gets it but for some jobs over 100
 people apply.                         
  Mr. Evans,the supervisor,thought that
 conditions are improving during 1985  
 and that employment prospects should  
 gradually improve. Karen Beardmore,   
 Jessica Murphy and Cathy Brennan.     </content>
