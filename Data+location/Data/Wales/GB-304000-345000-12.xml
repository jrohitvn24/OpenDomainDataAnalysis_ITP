		<title>12Law and Order (Gwyddelwern)</title>
		<content> Gwyddelwern is a small peaceful       
 village, consisting of a tightly knit 
 community of which in general, all its
 inhabitants are well known to each    
 other, therefore they respect the     
 other person and their lifestyle.     
 The requirements for internal law and 
 order are thus considerably less than 
 larger communities and are catered    
 for by the local{Police Station at    
{Corwen,}which is approximately 3 miles
 away.                                 
{The Magistrates Court}is held in      
{Corwen}twice a month.                 
 Solicitors are practicing in the      
 surrounding towns.
