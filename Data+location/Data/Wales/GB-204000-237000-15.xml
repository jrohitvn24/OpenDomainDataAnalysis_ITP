		<content> The Mayor's Committee and local       
 Clubs etc.look after entertainment in 
 the town,our Community Council,Preseli
 District Council and Dyfed County     
 Council and the National Park don't do
 anything like that.                   
 But these Councils can shout a lot for
 us and get things done.This year we   
 have had a T.V.Booster station,better 
 street lighting,new railings for thr  
 Cemetry,better road surface and more  
 because the Council asks for it.      
 The Nat.Park has drawn a Plan for     
 Newport in the future (and they can be
 nasty and tell you to build your house
 from stones!).                        
 We have many new places in town,new   
 surgery,telephone exchange,bus        
 station,bank,library and more.Our     
 school is very old and is falling     
 down,I don't think the Councils really
 care.                                 </content>
