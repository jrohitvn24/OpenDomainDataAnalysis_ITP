		<content>    In our block there are three       
 chapels,two are in Heolgerrig and the 
 other one is in Swansea Road.Also     
 there is Cephas Church in Brondeg and 
 it is Evangelical.                    
    Many people living in Heolgerrig   
 go to other churches like Cyfarthfa   
 ,Mormon  or the  Catholic  church.    
  About seventy people from Heolgerrig 
 go to Cyfarthfa church and a lot of   
 children from Heolgerrig go to        
 Brownies or Cubs because they are     
 held in the church hall.              
     Salem is Welsh Congregational.Most
 of the service is in Welsh and a      
 little Ennglish has been introduced.  
 there are about fifty five members,   
 thirty people attend on Sunday        
 evenings,about twelve on Sunday       
 morning.  Salem started behind the Six
 Bells but has been in the present     
 building on the main road since 1852. </content>
