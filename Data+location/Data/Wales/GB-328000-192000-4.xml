		<title>04   Transport in Cwmbran</title>
		<content>  The main forms of transport operating
 on the roads in the grid are cars and 
 buses. There are 21 bus routes        
 operated by one company, National     
 Welsh, which has a large depot in     
 Cwmbran. THe majority of children in  
 the school have a car at home, but    
 most walk to school.                  
   Behind our school, and running the  
 full lenght of the grid, is "Cwmbran  
 Drive". This road is under            
 construction, and has meant disruption
 in the village with clouds of dust and
 noise descending on our school.       
   This road has followed the disused  
 railway line and resulted in the      
 desruction of the canal in Cwmbran. It
 is being built to take away the       
 traffic from the main centre of the   
 town.
