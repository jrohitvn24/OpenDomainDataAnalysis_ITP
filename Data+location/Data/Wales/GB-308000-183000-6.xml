		<content> Residents of Efail Isaf are worried   
 about the prospects of a new and large
 housing development on the outskirts  
 of the village and are actively       
 opposing the plans.                   
 The developers plan to build 100      
 detached houses selling for between   
 #30,000 and #50,000 each .            
 They argue that such a large          
 development will, by increasing the   
 population, generally make the area   
 more attractive, provide a base of    
 labour and therefore encourage        
 employers to the area and provide     
 extra custom for local shops making   
 them more viable.                     
 The main concern of the opponents is  
 that Efail Isaf will become like      
 Radyr. Twenty years ago Radyr was a   
 small village on the outskirts of     
 Cardiff. One housing development grew 
 into another and so on.               </content>
