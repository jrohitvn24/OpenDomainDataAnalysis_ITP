		<title>16Public House in Llangunllo</title>
		<content>  The Greyhound Inn is still essentialy
 a working farmers club and a male     
 preserve.There are active Women's     
 Darts teams and a Rounders team (     
 shared with the W.I. ) but still women
 do not use the pub as often as men,   
 even if the days are gone when it was 
 seen as a ' House of Sin ' not to be  
 entered by a woman evem to buy        
 cigarettes.                           
  The coming of the Car and Television 
 means that the pub is no longer the   
 place where farmers meet after six    
 months absence at Christmas,          
 spontaneous sing songs only happen at 
 celebrations now but it is still the  
 social centre for local farmers.The   
 trophies won by the male darts and    
 dominoes teams, as well as by women,  
 are displayed proudly above the bar.
