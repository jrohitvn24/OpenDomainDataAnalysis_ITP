		<title>13PAUL AND MRS. HERRING'S DAY</title>
		<content>     I get up at 7.45am and have eggs  
 and bacon for breakfast. I then pack  
 my school bag and my mum gets ready   
 for work. My mother drives me to      
 school, which is only about half a    
 mile away. Sometimes we stop at the   
 local shop to buy some sweets. Then I 
 walk around to the school playground  
 at about 8.45am and school starts at  
 9.00am.                               
      My mother drives to work in      
 Nevill Hall Hospital Abergavenny which
 is about six miles away. She works as 
 a secretary for Dr.Jones a consultant.
 She goes into the foyer and then      
 catches the lift up to the third      
 floor. In her office she has a coffee 
 and then puts on her earphones and    
 starts typing from her dictating      
 machine.
