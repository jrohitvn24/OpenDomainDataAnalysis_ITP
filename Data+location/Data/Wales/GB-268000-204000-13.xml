		<title>13THE LIFE OF A VICAR. cont.</title>
		<content> The vicar, Mr. Jones, has a very      
 varied job, often the unexpected can  
 happen - perhaps an accident or a     
 death. Generally, on Mondays he writes
 and answers letters and tries to      
 prepare a plan for the week. He keeps 
 Monday afternoon free for visiting    
 hospital. During the rest of the week 
 he does many things. Basically, as a  
 vicar, he admimisters the Parish,     
 keeping his four churches open,       
 visiting the sick and bereaved, taking
 services, weddings, burials, baptisms 
 and confirmations. He tries to keep   
 Fridays as a day off and likes to     
 spend it doing nothing. Often he goes 
 shopping to Swansea, visits his mother
 or just potters about in the garden.
