 Q.What was the education like?        
      Education was of a very poor     
 standard and you only had primary     
 education until the 1930's when       
 Greenfield Central School was         
 built.Children had to pass an         
 entrance exam.If they failed they had 
 to stay in the primary school until   
 aged 14 years.                        
 Q. and what about the employment?     
     The employment then was mainly    
 mining which was under private        
 enterprise and was never regular for  
 example,men would go to work every    
 morning dressed for work in their     
 dirty clothes yet only half of them   
 would be able to work.Some women      
 worked in the tin works in Abercarn.  </content>
