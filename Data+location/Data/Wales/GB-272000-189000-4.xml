		<content>   Although our docks have fallen into 
 disuse, the deep water habour employs 
 160 people. The 100,000 ton ships that
 come into the harbour bring coal and  
 iron ore and other materials for the  
 steel works.                          
   Most of the working men in Port     
 Talbot work in the steel works. On the
 moors at Baglan there is the          
 J.R.Freeman cigar factory and about   
 1,100 work there.  Then to the        
 north-west of our area is a big       
 chemical works called B.P.Baglan Bay  
 where about 500 people work.          
   A new industrial park on Baglan     
 Moors is going to take up 146 acres.  
 The M4 motorway and railway adjoin on 
 the north side.                       
   In the south-east of our area are   
 some engineering works, many of which 
 rely on the British Steel Corporation 
 for their work.                       </content>
