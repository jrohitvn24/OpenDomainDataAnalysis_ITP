		<title>19LOCAL HISTORY MOELFRE</title>
		<content>{Two retired sea captains interviewed. 
 We went to the  Llanallgo School that 
 closed in 1977.We walked about a mile 
 from the village along a track, the   
 present road was built on it in 1922. 
 Moelfre did not change a lot between  
 1800-1945, then it grew slowly. After 
 1962 it grew quickly when the Wylfa   
 Power Station was built.              
 Until 1933 Moelfre had a busy herring 
 fishing industry a railway station was
 built in Benllech to carry the catch  
 in barrels to Manchester.Suddenly the 
 shoals of herring stopped coming and  
 the fishermen had to find other ways  
 of making a living.Before then many   
 lived on smallholdings,they made their
 own nets and pickled the herring for  
 their own use.
