		<content> GLASCOED FILTER STATION continued     
 All the filters at the station have   
 recently been converted to a dual     
 media operation.  A considerable      
 improvement in output has been        
 achieved by this modification and with
 the new filter the plant should be    
 capable of filtering about 4 million  
 gallons per day.  The water after     
 treatment is stored in Clear Water    
 reservoir tanks before being          
 distributed to St. Asaph, Abergele and
 Prestatyn.  All the Water Treatment   
 Plant is underground except for the   
 Filter House.  All the area is well   
 looked after, grass bankings, lawns   
 and gardens are tended by the workmen 
 employed at the plant.  They are      
 divided into Filter men and outside   
 maintenance men who work on the       
 rivers, reservoirs, boreholes etc.    
 that feed the treatment plant.        </content>
