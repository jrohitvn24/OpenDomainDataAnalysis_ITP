		<title>11Changes in Bangor</title>
		<content> It is over 30 years since it was first
 agreed that a new hospital was needed 
 for the area.Work was finally started 
 on a new district hospital in 1976 and
 finally some two or three years behind
 schedule the new{Ysbyty Gwynedd}was   
 opened in 1984. The old{Caernarfon and
{Anglesey Hospital}site has been sold  
 possibly to make way for a new        
 supermarket.                          
 Changes are proposed to the{Wellfield 
{Shopping Area.}Within the last year   
 over Â£1 million has been spent in     
 giving it a facelift and now a further
 Â£2 million is to be spent redeveloping
 a substantial part of the complex.    
 Included in the plans are a 20,000    
 square foot unit plus several other   
 smaller shop units.
