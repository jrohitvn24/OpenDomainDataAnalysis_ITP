		<content>  The playground looks desolate and    
 bare now that the children have gone. 
 There are loads of houses in Ynystawe.
 They all lead up to Clydach. Some are 
 very old and their gardens are untidy.
 Some houses have recently been built  
 and look like boxes in a row. There   
 are washing lines in the gardens and  
 mothers putting washing on the line,  
 staggering up the garden with bundles 
 of washing, like snails carrying their
 houses.                               
  I can see where the stack used to be.
 Bricks remain scattered on wasteland  
 from the time when the stack was blown
 up.                                   
  I can see Ynystawe Park . The        
 roundabout looks like a large cake.   
  This is how I see Ynystawe from the  
 sky. The birds are very lucky. I wish 
 I was a bird.
