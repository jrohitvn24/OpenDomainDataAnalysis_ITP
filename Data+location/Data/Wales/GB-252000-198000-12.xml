		<title>12FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> On Sundays my family wake up at       
 8.30a.m.We all have breakfast together
 which is usually cereal,toast and a   
 cup of tea.My mother then puts the    
 dirty washing in the machine and we   
 all get ready to go to visit my       
 grandparents.My family include my mum,
 my dad,my two brothers and myself.We  
 come back from my grandparents at     
 11.30a.m. so my mother can make Sunday
 dinner.My favourite is                
 beef,potatoes,carrots,cabbage and     
 gravy with syrup sponge for pudding.  
 After dinner I might play with my     
 computer,radio-controlled car or my   
 B.M.X. bicycle.At 5 o'clock we have   
 Sunday tea:sausage rolls and cakes,   
 then we're allowed to play until      
 8.00.p.m. We have a bath and the whole
 family watch "That's Life" on T.V..At 
 10.30. I go to bed and read comics    
 before finally going to sleep.        </content>
