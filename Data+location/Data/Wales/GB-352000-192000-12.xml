		<title>12Education. Hospital school</title>
		<content> St. Lawrence has a special school.It  
 is a school for children that are     
 badly burned or injured.The Head of   
 the school is Mrs. Cavill,who has been
 Head for 7 years.The school can take  
 20-40 children.In the school there are
 4 teachers and 3 nursery nurses.They  
 teach the children in all subjects.   
 It's more difficult to teach children 
 who can't move,so they are taught     
 in their beds.The school has been     
 attached to the hospital for 34 years.
 The nurses look after the children    
 after school hours.The most children  
 they have had in the school at one    
 time is 70.Children come from all     
 over South Wales and over the         
 border in England.If the Burns Unit is
 eventually moved from Chepstow then   
 this very special school will have to 
 close.
