		<title>14WATCHING TELEVISION 1985.</title>
		<content>   We can watch television on four     
 channels.  They each broadcast for    
 about sixteen hours every day.        
   We surveyed the children aged 5 to  
 11 in our school and discovered that  
 they watched, on average, 2.5 hours of
 television each week-day.  The most   
 popular channel was I.T.V. and the    
 least popular was B.B.C.2.            
   The types of programmes children    
 enjoyed watching were{comedy          
{programmes}like Bewitched (an American
 programme),{soap-operas}like The Young
 Doctors (Australian) and Emmerdale    
 Farm (British), and{light             
{entertainment programmes}like Give us 
 a Clue, Lift Off, and The Wall Game.  
   In our school, 64% of pupils have a 
 video recorder and most of them belong
 to a video library from which they can
 hire video films at a cost of Â£1 to   
 Â£1.50 per night.                      </content>
