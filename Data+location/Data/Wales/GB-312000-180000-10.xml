		<content> There are very few places where people
 can go for their entertainment in the 
 area.There is only one cinema,the     
 Monico,which is used by a great       
 proportion of people young and old at 
 some time of the year.It is not a     
 large cinema but it does show some    
 very modern films.Much of the people's
 home entertainment consists of        
 watching television and video films.  
 Children who were surveyed on leisure 
 interests listed watching television  
 as the fourth most popular for girls, 
 behind swimming,Girl Guides and music.
 For boys it was third most popular    
 behind swimming and Boy Scouts.The    
 most popular types of television      
 programme are cartoons,quizes,pop     
 music shows and adventure films.      
 Many of the families have video       
 recorders.
