		<content> This is the oldest business in        
 Llandysul, and was established in 1896
 to undertake the printing of books,   
 posters and pamphlets. It now employs 
 40 people and operates a newsagent    
 shop and delivers newspapers within a 
 3 mile radius. Although it undertakes 
 the printing of community newspapers, 
 posters, tickets etc, its main work is
 concerned with the printing of books, 
 porticualy in{Welsh.}It does a great  
 deal of work for the{Local Education  
{Authority}supplying all the schools in
 Dyfed with the majority of their text 
 books, and also some of the libraries.
 Much of the work they do, and material
 published, is aimed at fostering the  
 Welsh language and arresting its      
 decline. They print a number of items 
 for the{National Eisteddfod,}e.g.the  
 confidential list of winners in the   
{Crown}and{Chair}bardic competitions.  </content>
