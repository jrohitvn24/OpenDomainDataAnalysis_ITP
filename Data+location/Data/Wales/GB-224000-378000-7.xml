		<content>    There are many living things at the
 sea shore.We had a look at a starfish.
 We turned it upside down and had a    
 look at it's legs.We saw its mouth and
 it put it insideit stomach.There are  
 lots of rocky pools in Trearddur Bay  
 and in these pools there is a lot of  
 life.We can find blenies in shallow   
 rock pools - they are very well       
 camouflaged.We can also see lug worm  
 trails also - near them there are     
 holes usally.
