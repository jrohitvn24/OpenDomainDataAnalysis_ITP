		<title>17PELLS SWEET FACTORY</title>
		<content>     {Pells}was established in 1870. It
 was a family business until 1983.     
 There are 21 people employed there    
 most of whom are women. The factory   
 has 24 machines which produce 1.5 tons
 of sweets every week - a large output 
 for a small enterprise.  The sweets   
 produced from a sugar-glucose base,   
 are exported to the{Bahamas and other 
{countries}but most are sent to the    
{North of England.}They produce{22     
{varieties,}the most popular of which  
 is one called{"Old English Mints".}The
 stripes are put into the mints by     
 laying strips of white mixture on the 
 brown coloured base. The whole mixture
 is then rolled together, stretched and
 fed into the machine. Accidents are   
 quite frequent, the common being burns
 from the hot sweet mixture.
