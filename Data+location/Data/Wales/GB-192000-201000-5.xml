		<title>05Wallaston Farm Part 2</title>
		<content> I was surprised to see the farmer use 
 a large wheeled tricycle instead of a 
 dog,to get in the cows and sheep.He   
 said it was much cheaper,and the jumbo
 wheels did not mark the soft ground in
 winter.There are many dangerous things
 on the farm perhaps the most dangerous
 being electricity from the overhead   
 power cables and the many appliances  
 on the farm.Farmers have to be careful
 all the time and must not take        
 risks.The farmer told us that an angry
 cow was far worse than an angry bull  
 because it will not give up and said  
 he once had a cow chase the dog into  
 the farmhouse,causing a great deal of 
 damage,because the dog had barked at  
 it's calf!
