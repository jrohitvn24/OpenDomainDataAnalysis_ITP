		<title>02PONTSTICILL SINCE 1800</title>
		<content>    In the early 1800's the Pontsticill
 area was an important agriculutral    
 region, it played a very important    
 part in supplying food for the        
 industrial town of Merthyr Tydfil.    
    In the last century the most       
 important member of the community was 
 the farmer.It was his job to provide  
 food for the surrounding areas. To    
 provide the farmer with what he wanted
 there were other tradesmen,such as the
 shoemaker,the itinerant cloggers who  
 would make clogs from the alder trees,
 the fuller used the farmers wool to   
 make cloth for clothes.               
    After the Pentwyn reservoir was    
 built in the 1860's many people       
 travelled from Dowlais and Merthyr to 
 Pontsticill to attend summer fairs and
 fetes,with over 6000 people present on
 a single day,some of whom even sailed 
 on the lake steamer built in 1865.    </content>
