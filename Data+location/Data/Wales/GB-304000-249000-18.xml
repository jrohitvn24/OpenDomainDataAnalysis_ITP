		<title>18FARMING AROUND BUILTH WELLS</title>
		<content> The farmland around Builth is mostly  
 grassland. Sheep are grazed           
 extensively on the higher ground,     
 especially on Mynydd Epynt while quite
 a few cattle are kept on the richer   
 lower ground,especially in the Wye    
 valley.Hay and silage is made in large
 quantities in early summer and stored 
 in barns or silage clamps for winter  
 feed.Many of the farms in the Builth  
 district have hill rights for sheep   
 and ponies though most of the hills   
 are covered with bracken. Even this   
 bracken is harvested by some farmers  
 for animal bedding in the autumn.     
 Cattle are kept mainly for beef with  
 some kept on for breeding.Some milk is
 sold. There is a thriving local market
 for sheep and cattle in Builth though 
 some farmers send their animals to    
 Brecon,Hay,Talgarth,Rhayadr,etc. Sales
 are also held on the Royal Welsh.     </content>
