		<content>   Llandrindod Wells is a small town of
 some 4,000 inhabitants set in the     
 heart of rural Wales, nestling        
 peacefully on the banks of the River  
 Ithon. It is situated in the county of
 Powys (formerly Radnorshire) and is   
 now the Administrative Headquarters of
 the new county.The town itself has a  
 very Victorian air about it due mainly
 to the popularity of the Spa Waters at
 the turn of the century. At that time 
 it was a thriving and prosperous      
 community and its impressive          
 architecture is a legacy of this      
 period. The surrounding area is almost
 totally rural with farming and tourism
 together with the Local Government    
 Headquarters being the major form of  
 employment in the area.
