		<content> CONCERN IS FELT BY THE INHABITANTS    
 THAT THE ROYAL AIR FORCE ARE TAKING   
 THEIR LOW FLYING EXERCISES SO         
 SERIOUSLY IN THE AREA. PARTICULARLY ON
 CLEAR, SUNNY DAYS, HIGH-SPEED JETS    
 ROAR ACROSS THE SKY AND SEEM SO LOW   
 THAT THEY CAN BE TOUCHED. THE         
 TARGET FOR THE JETS IS THE RIVER      
 WYE WITH ITS DISTINCTIVE BRIDGES THEY 
 FLY BELOW THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS AND      
 FRIGHTEN THE PONY TREKKERS ALTHOUGH   
 THE SHEEP HAVE NOW BECOME USED TO THEM
 AND HARDLY PAUSE IN THEIR GRAZING.    
 WINDOWS RATTLE AND OLD PEOPLE MUTTER  
 AS THE JETS HURTLE ALONG THE VALLEY - 
 A LOW FLYING TRANSPORT PLANE IS ALSO A
 REGULAR VISITOR TO THE AREA. IT WAS   
 NOTED WITH SOME AMUSEMENT THAT THE    
 VERY REGULAR FLY PASTS CEASED ALMOST  
 ENTIRELY DURING THE RECENT            
 PARLIAMENTARY BY ELECTION.
