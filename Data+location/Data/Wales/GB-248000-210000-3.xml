		<title>03Land Utilisation of the Area</title>
		<content>  The soil of the area is not very     
 fertile;thus little arable farming is 
 carried on by local farmers.There is a
 predominance of pasture and meadowland
 which supports a local dairy industry.
 There are many extensive tracts of    
 rough pastureland in the area of {    
{D1;D2;D3}and{D4}.The same kind of land
 can be seen in blocks{D5;D8;D9;D10;D11
{and D12}.In these areas,sheep_rearing 
 is the chief occupation of the        
 farmers. The little arable farming    
 that is carried on concentrates mainly
 on the cultivation of potatoes,       
 turnips,swedes and green veg.These are
 sold locally or in the markets of     
 Llanelli and Carmarthen.              
  Much of the land in block{D10}has    
 been taken up by the local colliery in
 the form of railway sidings and tips  
 of waste slag.These still remain      
 although the mine has been closed.    </content>
