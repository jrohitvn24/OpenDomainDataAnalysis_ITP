 The city centre provides different    
 types of shopping environment.        
{Kingsway and Oxford Street are        
{traditional shopping streets}with a   
 variety of local and national stores. 
 The council has tried to make shopping
 easier by creating pedestrian         
 precints.   Most of the big chain     
 stores have moved into the{Quadrant   
{centre.}Shopping is very easy here    
 because it is all under cover, and the
 atmosphere is pleasant because there  
 is music, no litter and no graffitti. 
{The new covered market}replaces the   
 one destroyed in the war. It is a     
 fascinating place with all its food   
 stalls, many of which have been in the
 same family for several generations.  
 It is possible to buy all types of    
 food including cockles and laverbread.</content>
