		<title>02PORTHCAWL-Tourist Centre</title>
		<content> When the harbour closed in 1906,      
 Porthcawl began to grow in popularity 
 as a tourist centre.Today it is a     
 thriving holiday town,containing many 
 protected coves.                      
 As well as the many natural features  
 of the coastline,Porthcawl has many   
 other attractions for the tourist.The 
 remains of the old dock is now used as
 a small harbour and it is the centre  
 of the Porthcawl Motorboat and Ski    
 Club.Keen fishermen can find an       
 extraordinary variety of fish in the  
 area.There is a large Amusement       
 Park,as well as many cafes,restaurants
 and hotels.To the east of the         
 Amusement Park,is one of the largest  
 caravan parks in Europe.In the main   
 shopping area,housed in the old police
 station,there is a small museum.
