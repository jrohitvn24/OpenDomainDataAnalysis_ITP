    The working horses were the main   
 asset of the farm before the advent of
 the tractor.Corn was sown and thrashed
 by hand and a weekly visit made to the
 local mill.The sheaves of corn gave   
 the countryside quite a different     
 aspect from nowadays. The farm        
 employed two workers who earned 10-12 
 shillings a week and had a house      
 provided.Today Mr.Anstey's son runs   
 the farm and only hires contract      
 labour at busy times.In the past      
 Mr.Anstey knew ninety per cent of the 
 community,so help was always at hand  
 from a neighbour 'unlike today'.Home  
 life too was very different.Cooking   
 was on an open fire.Every farm had a  
 pig sty and always had two or three   
 sides of bacon hanging.Food was salted
 for preservation and butter,milk and  
 cheese all produced on the farm.      </content>
