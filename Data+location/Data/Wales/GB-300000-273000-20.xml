		<content> It is becoming more difficult to be   
 able to live in a rural area as remote
 as this one of Bwlchysarnau. There are
 problems of declining services, the   
 increasing cost of petrol as a car is 
 essential and the distances involved  
 to the various amenities that are     
 taken for granted by many people in   
 this day and age e.g. sports centres, 
 cinemas, theatres and supermarkets.   
 Farmers are also having problems with 
 the declining value of land and       
 increases in the price of feedstuffs  
 etc.                                  
     Nevertheless I for one wouldn't   
 live anywhere else. The benefits of a 
 slower way of life can't be counted in
 financial terms.
