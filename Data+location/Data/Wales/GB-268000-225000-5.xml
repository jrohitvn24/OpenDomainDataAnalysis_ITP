		<title>05My Special Day 2</title>
		<content> At half past three we finished playing
 and I helped Hefin,my brother to put  
 manure in the garden.By the time we   
 had finished it was tea time.After tea
 Daniela friend came down and we went  
 to the field to play soccer.We all    
 took turns at scoring and saving.We   
 finished playing at twenty five past  
 seven and we went in.I watched        
 Coronation Street and ate my supper at
 the same time.After supper I watched a
 film called Hawk the Slayer on H.T.V. 
 and it finished at ten o' clock.I then
 went to bed,contented with my special 
 day.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
