		<title>10   'PARSON'S FOLLY'</title>
		<content>    Within the village of Tonna we have
 many places of interest,one of which,a
 local landmark,is the{Ivy Tower.}This 
 tower used to be a Summer guest house 
 for the people visiting the old{Gnoll 
{House.}They used to hold Summer dances
 there.Very near this place is the area
 known as{'Parson's Folly'.            
        This area used to have a bridge
 with railway lines crossing over it.  
 Long ago it carried trucks of coal    
 from one of the local collieries.One  
 local story tells us of a{Mr.Parsons, 
 who was the architect who designed the
 bridge.Apparently after being in use  
 for a while,something went wrong and  
 the bridge collapsed.Mr.Parsons       
 worried so much over this that he     
 committed suicide - and hence the name
{'PARSON'S FOLLY'.
