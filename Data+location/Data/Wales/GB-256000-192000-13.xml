		<title>13THREE CROSSES VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Like Dunvant and Killay,Three Crosses 
 or Crwys,to give it its Welsh name,has
 become a dormitory area for people    
 working in Swansea and districts near-
 by,the only employment in or near the 
 village being on five small farms and 
 in three shops.                       
 Although there are two public houses, 
 the village lacks amenities for young 
 people as is evident by the number who
 congregate on the village green in the
 evenings.The new Community Centre is  
 too small to cater for large groups   
 although the Young Farmers' Club,the  
 Women's Institute and a Mother and    
 Toddler Group make use of its         
 facilities.                           
 Use is made of the School Hall for    
 meetings of Brownies and Guides and a 
 Kung Fu Club.It is also the venue for 
 a monthly disco for local youth.
