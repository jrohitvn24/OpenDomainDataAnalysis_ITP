		<title>11BUILTH (W): EDUC.(PRIMARY)</title>
		<content>  Builth (W) serves as the educational 
 centre for the surrounding area       
 stretching westwards as far as        
 Llanwrtyd Wells,northwards to         
 Newbridge on Wye and Hundred House and
 southwards as far as Erwood.          
  The primary school is housed in a two
 storey stone building,which was       
 erected in 1911. There are eight      
 classes for the four to eleven age    
 range,and there are about 230 pupils  
 on roll.There are no playing          
 fields, so the Groe has to be used for
 any team games.Dining facilities are  
 shared with the high school.
