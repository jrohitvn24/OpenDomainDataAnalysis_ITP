         The main road from Swansea to 
 Brecon (A4067)winds along the floor of
 the Swansea Valley.                   
         At Ystalyfera a new road was  
 made in the 1960's to by-pass the     
 village of Godre-Graig,when the old   
 road was partly destroyed in a        
 landslide.                            
         The road from Cwmllynfell down
 to Cwmtwrch is a twisting road mainly 
 following the course of the river     
 Twrch (B4599)                         
         A road to by-pass the town of 
 Ystradgynlais was built in the 1970's 
 on the route of the old Swansea canal.
 This main road now passes through the 
 village of Gurnos.
