		<content> Most of the inhabitants of this       
 sparsely populated community speak    
 English and Welsh.  Most of the farms 
 are occupied by people who are        
 bilingual but whose mother tongue is  
 Welsh.  However in recent years some  
 of the farms have been bought by      
 entirely English speaking people,     
 resulting in a very Welsh area        
 becoming more Anglicized.  In the     
 owner-occupied cottages and pockets of
 houses in the area the same applies.  
 All people speak English fluently,many
 speak Welsh fluently, some have a less
 fluent command of Welsh, some have a  
 smattering, and a few have no         
 knowledge of the language at all.     
 There are two centres of worship in   
 our block, one has services entirely  
 in Welsh, and the other is bilingual. 
 Public meeting and clubs are generally
 conducted in English.                 </content>
