		<title>12Shops in Glanaman.</title>
		<content>    There has been a decline in the    
 number of shops in Glanaman during    
 recent years. Several former shops are
 now empty, bearing witness to the fact
 that most people now prefer to do the 
 bulk of their shopping in the large   
 supermarkets of the nearby towns.     
    There is however, a concentration  
 of small shops selling basic          
 necessities on and around the village 
 square. These include a grocery, a    
 post office, a chemist, a butcher and 
 a bakery. There are also two cafe/fish
 and chip shops, which are quite       
 popular with the local community.     
    In addition to this nucleus of     
 shops, there are two newsagent/       
 groceries in the outlying areas of    
 Glanaman, which serve local           
 concentrations of housing.
