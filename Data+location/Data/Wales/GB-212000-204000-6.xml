 building as we use today.The school-  
 master had a high desk in the middle  
 of the hall and often gave the boys   
 the stick.                            
 Girls wore high-button boots,boys     
 clogs with horseshoes or hobnailed    
 boots which made sparks on the stones.
 All the clothes and shoes were made in
 the village.
