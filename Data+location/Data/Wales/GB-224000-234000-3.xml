		<title>03Fishing on the river Cuch.</title>
		<content> I like going fishing with my father on
 the river Cuch.My father goes fishing 
 to have a rest from his work.We use   
 worms for bait and sometimes we use   
 spinners.Father and I get the worms   
 from the dunghill.Sometimes I get a   
 bucket of hot water and I put some    
 Fairy Liquid into the bucket and I tip
 the water onto the lawn and the worms 
 come up to the surface.We catch       
 rainbow trout most of the time.Once   
 dad caught a flat fish in the river   
 Cuch.It had red spots on it.Father and
 I buy a trout fishing licence at the  
 beginning of the season.The licence   
 costs Â£6.80 for my father and Â£4.60   
 for me.I have a red and black rod     
 which is four feet long.My dad has a  
 five foot light brown rod.I enjoy     
 fishing very much.
