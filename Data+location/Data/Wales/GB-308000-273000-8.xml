		<title>08SHEEP DOGS IN LLANBISTER</title>
		<content>    The Scotch Border Collie is best   
 for both work and trials. the points  
 look for are a medium sized dog with a
 good friendly temperament, not shy or 
 nervous. Must be a "wide" worker with 
 plenty of power and stamina and       
 obedient. Spotting a good dog is a    
 gift.                                 
    The three month training starts at 
 six months old.Hard work, patience and
 skill are essential. Dogs are         
 indispensable in this hilly area, it  
 being imposible to collect sheep      
 without them. The dogs are well looked
 after and fed on a high protein diet. 
    Sheep Dog Trials are very popular  
 and a local farmer achieved national  
 fame in 1982 when he won the BBC's    
 "One Man and his dog" singles title   
 with his dog Rod. Such dogs are well  
 sought after both at home and abroad, 
 Rod is now in the United States.      </content>
