		<content> TALYBONT PRIMARY SCHOOL               
 There is only one school in our block 
 which is the Talybont Primary School. 
 The present School was opened in 1969 
 and it is a semi-open plan school.    
 There are four classrooms each with   
 individual  cloakrooms and toilets.   
 The reception class and infants class 
 open their partitions on to the school
 hall, while the lower and top junior  
 classrooms can either have an open or 
 closed partition between them.        
 There are for teachers in the school- 
 Mr Thomas the Headmaster who teaches  
 the top juniors, Mrs Jones the Deputy 
 Head who teaches the infants, Mrs     
 Charlton who teaches the 7-9 year olds
 and Miss Jones who teaches the top    
 infants. There are at present 96      
 children in the school but 12 of them 
 will be leaving for Secondary School  
 at the end of this Summer Term.       </content>
