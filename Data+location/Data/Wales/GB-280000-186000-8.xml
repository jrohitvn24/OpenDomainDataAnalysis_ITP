		<content> The house designed by the architect   
 Thomas Hopper was built between 1830 -
 40 for Christopher Rice Mansel-Talbot 
 and his family.  Sold by order of the 
 estate trustees in 1942 it was        
 requisitioned and used by American    
 soldiers.  Unoccupied from the end of 
 the second World War it was largely   
 neglected and gutted by fire in August
 1977.                                 
 Restoration is taking place.  The     
 north wing has been rebuilt and       
 refurbished for use as offices with   
 plans for converting ground floor     
 rooms to recreate the furnishings and 
 atmosphere of such living quarters in 
 the heyday of the castle.  The        
 entrance hall and staircase tower has 
 also been re-roofed.                  
 Outbuildings house an exhibition,     
 shop, restaurant and audio visual     
 theatre.                              </content>
