 In Tredegar we have the Leisure       
Centre.  The sports it organises are   
football, swimming, tennis,            
roller-skating and netball.  The parks 
in the area are not safe for children. 
There is a lot of rubbish which has    
been left, plastic bags and broken     
glass bottles.  In Tredegar Park,      
there are bowling greens, tennis       
courts, swings, slides and a           
round-about. There is a new county     
park in Tredegar, in this park there   
are water sports, fishing, camping,    
walking and there will be an aeroplane 
landing site. Swimming is the activity 
which everybody enjoys.  In the park   
there is an open air pool - it's no    
wonder it only costs 20p because it is 
always cold.  In Tredegar we have many 
kinds of sporting activities for both  
old and young.                         </content>
