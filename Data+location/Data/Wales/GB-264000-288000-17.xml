		<content> TALYBONT 40 YEARS AGO                 
 40 years ago there were more people in
 Talybont than there are now,that was  
 mainly due to the lead mining industry
 at Allt y Crib and the mountains above
 Talybont.At that time Welsh was the   
 language spoken by most people.There  
 were 12 shops in the village where as 
 now there are only 3.There were 3     
 chapels and 1 church but 40 years ago 
 many more people attended the         
 services.The smithy in the village was
 a very busy place as so many farmers  
 depended on horses,and on the Square  
 there was a bakery where everybody    
 brought their bread to be baked.There 
 was also 2 woollen mills and a flour  
 mill,all depending on water from the 2
 rivers.One of the highlights of the   
 year was the Talybont Fair held on the
 Square where farmers bargained for    
 servants for the year.                </content>
