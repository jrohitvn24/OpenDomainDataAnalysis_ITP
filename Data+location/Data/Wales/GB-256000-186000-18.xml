		<title>183.5 MILLION ARE OUT OF A JOB</title>
		<content>   My name is Tom O'kane. I live down {
{Cilonnen Road}next to{Three Crosses.} 
 It is a very rural area and there are 
 not many houses within a mile. I am 12
 years old. The world we live in is a  
 world of modernization. I go to{      
{Bishopston}school although I am}nearer
{Gowerton}school.                      
   About 3.5 million are out of jobs.  
 Lately there has been an outbreak of  
 AID's. Drugs are quite normal to hear 
 of in{Bishopston}but police are not   
 doing anything about them.            
   President Reagan has just met with  
 the Russian leader who does not want  
 Star Wars project to go ahead.        
   My main hobbies are golfing, surfing
 and sailing. Talking of modernization 
 they are threatening to knock down    
{Carmel Chapel}which is a very old     
 chapel down my road.
