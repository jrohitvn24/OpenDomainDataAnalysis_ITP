		<title>06BMX bike riding.</title>
		<content> Many of the boys in our area have had 
 BMX bikes as birthday or christmas    
 presents.These are special strong     
 bikes which can be used for doing     
 tricks.I can do "wheelies",which is   
 riding on the back wheel with the     
 front wheel in the air,and a"bunny    
 hop" this is when first one wheel is  
 lifted off the ground followed quickly
 by the other wheel.BMX bikes are great
 but not everyone thinks so! a few days
 ago our school had a visit from our   
 local policeman pc Flynn.He came to   
 warn us of the dangers of doing tricks
 on the roads and pavements.Luckily    
 this might stop soon because a BMX    
 track is being built on our estate(the
 Gurnos).                              
 There are competitions for BMX riders 
 in the leisure centre and famous      
 riders give demonstations.The sport is
 really popular throughout Merthyr.    </content>
