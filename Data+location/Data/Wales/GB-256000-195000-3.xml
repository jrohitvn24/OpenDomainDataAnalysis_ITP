		<title>03Gowerton Livestock Market.</title>
		<content> The livestock market is held in       
 Gowerton every Tuesday.A lot of the   
 local farmers have to go to Carmarthen
 market because that is bigger but a   
 lot still attend Gowerton Mart still. 
     The main animals that are sold in 
 the mart are calves,sheep,goats and   
 some cows.They arrive at the market by
 11.00am on Tuesday morning,if they are
 not sold the farmer has to take them  
 away with him back to the farm.       
     When we visited the mart we had   
 the chance to talk to the             
 auctioneer.He told us that he was the 
 sixth person in his family to have    
 been an auctioneer in Gowerton        
 market.It was his Grandfather that had
 moved the market to its'present site  
 in 1927 from the original 1917 site.  
      The market is a busy place and   
 one day every week it is the centre of
 all activity in the town of Gowerton. </content>
