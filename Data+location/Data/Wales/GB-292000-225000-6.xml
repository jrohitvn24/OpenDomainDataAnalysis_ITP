		<title>06DEFYNNOG &amp; THE NATIONAL PARK</title>
		<content>   Defynnog is in the National Park. A 
 National Park is an area of untamed   
 beauty. In the National Park you will 
 see mountain ponies, badgers, rabbits,
 buzzards, moles, mice, hawks, kites   
 and lots lots more! There are farms in
 the National Park as well and they    
 have more animals. Some farmers also  
 grow crops of barley &amp; oats. Within   
 the Park there are three main mountain
 ranges. The most famous range is the  
 Brecon Beacons; Defynnog lies between 
 these &amp; Fforest Fawr (another range). 
 A Field centre has been set up quite  
 close to Defynnog. Many tourists &amp;    
 locals visit this. The fences and     
 stone walls are the farmers property  
 but you can walk through them by using
 public footpaths &amp; gates &amp; stiles. The
 National Park is bounded by Ammanford,
 Abergavenny, Merthyr, Hay and Brecon.
