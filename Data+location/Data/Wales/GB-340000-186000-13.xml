		<title>13INDUSTRY MAGOR BREWERY</title>
		<content>  The Magor brewery cost Whitbread over
 Â£52m and was originally designed to   
 supply the rapidly expanding UK lager 
 market.It is now able to brew both    
 ales and lagers and is the home of    
 Welsh Bitter.It has been designed to  
 cater for the future:currently it can 
 brew over 1 million barrels of beer a 
 year,but there is sufficient          
 potential to double output if         
 required.                             
  The site chosen for any new brewery  
 in South Wales had to be served by    
 good communication routes.The 58 acre 
 site is next to the M4,London to South
 Wales motorway,and near the           
 North/South M5 route.                 
  Magor is made up of eight separate   
 buildings,all linked by elevated      
 walkways allowing easy access to all  
 parts of the brewery.These walkways   
 also carry the service pipes.         </content>
