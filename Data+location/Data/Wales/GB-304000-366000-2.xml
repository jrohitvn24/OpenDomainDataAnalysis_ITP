		<content> The area is mainly open countryside   
 interspersed with much mixed          
 woodland.The land height increases    
 from{100'}A.S.L.in the East to{600'}in
 the West,with the limestone outcrops  
 emerging as height increases.A wide   
 variety of wildlife is supported      
 throughout the whole area,{37}species 
 of flowers were identified during a 1 
 hour observation,the{early purple     
{orchid}occuring but once on a         
 sheltered bank.The{primrose}was scarce
 despite the abundance of favourable   
 sites.                                
   All the common birds were seen      
 including{ravens}which nest in the    
 nearby{limestone quarry.}Many small   
 mammals are also known to exist.{Foxes
 are present although there is no      
 evidence of{badgers,}the land being   
 too low lying tothe East and too close
 to human habitations in the West.     </content>
