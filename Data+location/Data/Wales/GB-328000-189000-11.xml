		<title>11The Canal at Bettws,Newport</title>
		<content>   In{1792} permission was granted to  
 build a{canal}from Newport to both    
 Pontwewydd and Crumlin.The canal was  
 22 miles long and took 3 years to     
 build.Only picks and shovels were used
 in its building.{Barges}transported   
 iron and coal to Newport docks.The    
 canal was at its busiest between 1800 
 and 1850.In 1852 the railway opened   
 between Newport and Pontypool and the 
 canal became derelict.                
   In{1971 Gwasted lock,}Malpas was{   
{restored}to working order and part of 
 the canal and towpath cleaned.On our  
 visit to the canal we saw the lock    
 working.A crack has appeared in the   
 lock wall recently and may prevent it 
 being filled and emptied.Some parts of
 the canal are very pretty while other 
 parts are dry and full of rubbish.
