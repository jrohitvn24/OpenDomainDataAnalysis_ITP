		<content>        The day we went to the farm we 
 walked up the lane until we came to   
 the farm gate.Mr.Evans the farmer met 
 us.First of all he showed us young{   
{chicks.}We all held one.We also saw{  
{goslings}and noticed their webbed     
 feet.                                 
  There was a{cow}in a field as well as
 a{horse}and a{donkey.}We also saw two 
{goats.}There were{sheep}and lambs in  
 the fields too.Farmers need{dogs}to   
 help look after sheep.Mr.Evans had    
 three dogs called Brandy , Lady and   
 Nuffy.Mr.Evans breeds{budgerigars}and 
 he showed us the birds in their cages.
             After we had been shown   
 around the farm we asked the farmer   
 questions.Before we left,the farmer's 
 son gave each of us an apple.We said  
 thankyou and walked back to school.
