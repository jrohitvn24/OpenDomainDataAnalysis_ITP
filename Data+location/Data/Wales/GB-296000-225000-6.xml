		<content> In Libanus there are two types of     
 building  material used; stone and    
 brick. The majority of the stone      
 buildings are the older houses and    
 farms. Many of the farmhouses were    
 built by the farmers, when the land   
 was first cultivated, using the local 
 stone for walls and slate for the     
 roof. The modern houses are built of  
 brick or simulated stone and they have
 tiles for the roof. Today it is easier
 and cheaper for the builder to buy    
 bricks, artificial stone and tiles to 
 build with. Most of the farms have    
 coal or log fires and some have       
 central heating.The majority of modern
 houses are heated by central heating. 
 The village houses and some farms have
 a piped water supply and mains        
 drainage but some of the more remote  
 farms have their water supplied from a
 spring and have septic tanks.         </content>
