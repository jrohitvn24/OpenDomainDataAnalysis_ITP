		<content> At present there are approximately 50 
 teachers and 1000 pupils at Darland   
 School.  The current headmaster is    
 D.J.Gwilliam who came to the school in
 1978.                                 
                                       
 There have been plans to further      
 extend the school including another   
 hall and a swimming pool but education
 cuts have meant that only mobile      
 classrooms have been added.  Mobiles  
 are now to be removed as pupil numbers
 decrease.  Two classrooms are in the  
 process of conversion into an         
 electronics laboratory.               
                                       
 In 1984 the school bought a minibus   
 with the assistance of the Parent     
 Teacher Association.  They have also  
 helped to buy camping equipment and   
 microcomputers.
