		<title>10LOCAL HISTORY-COITY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      When I attended Coity Primary    
 School, I began in the Reception Class
 in l946. Later I progressed to the    
 Junior Department. The last class I   
 went into was the top class. There    
 were only four classrooms and outside 
 toilets for everyone. The church hall 
 was used as a canteen. Each classroom 
 was heated by a large coal stove with 
 a guard around it. There wasn't a hall
 and four small yards around the school
 were our playgrounds. Discipline was  
 strict and the 'Stick' was used if    
 anyone was very disobedient or        
 naughty. Arithmetic and English were  
 taught in the morning. Art,           
 singing,geography and history in the  
 afternoon. Sometimes nature study and 
 scripture too. "Drill" was taken in   
 the yard, and we lined up in          
 regimental lines after playtime to go 
 into the school.                      </content>
