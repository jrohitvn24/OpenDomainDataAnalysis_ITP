		<content>   Meliden and Dyserth each have their 
 own constables,P.C.Steve Harris in    
 Dyserth and P.C.Neil McAdam in        
 Meliden. Both constables are          
 responsible for keeping law and order 
 in their areas (patch). This is       
 achieved mainly through regular foot  
 patrols.Further support is available  
 from Prestatyn Police Station, where  
 Chief Superintendant Owen has overall 
 charge for the district. He in turn is
 responsible to the Chief Constable of 
 the North Wales Police Force,whose    
 headquarters is in Colwyn Bay.        
   The crime rate in both areas is     
 relatively low, the most frequent     
 crime being burglary.In fact Ysgol    
 Hiraddug and Ysgol Melyd have been    
 broken into during the past twelve    
 months, and electrical goods stolen.  
 The crime detection rate in Dyserth is
 about 40% .                           </content>
