		<content> In our DOMESDAY plot there are many   
 hills and valleys, although they are  
 not steep they cause a lot of         
 inconvenience for the  people who     
 manage them.A prominent feature of    
 the region's topography is a complex  
 system of glacial drainage channels.  
 Both the Gwaun valley and the Esgyrn  
 regions show features of glaciation.  
 The Gwaun valley shows a typically    
 glacial feature of a "U" shaped       
 valley, with a wide flood plain a     
 misfit river and steep valley sides   
 between 20 and 40 degrees,which are   
 densely wooded. The Crinei brook      
 valley also has a wide flood plain    
 with a tiny brook meandering through  
 it.The valley floor is very soft and  
 is made up of layers of peat.The      
 presence of reeds and other moisture  
 loving plants is further evidence of  
 the valley's swampy nature.           </content>
