		<title>15Churches and Chapels</title>
		<content> The predominant religion is Welsh     
 non-Conformism with a large number of 
 chapels scattered throughout the area.
 Although{Llangennech}has three        
 chapels, only one, the Welsh baptist  
 chapel comes within this block. It    
 also has a Church, and the Roman      
 Catholic faith also meet twice every  
 Sunday in the Church in Wales church  
 hall.                                 
{Hendy}has four Welsh chapels, one of  
 which is nearly 300 years old. The    
 Church building itself burnt down in  
 1979, and parishioners now meet in the
 church hall nearby.                   
{Pontarddulais}contains the greatest   
 number of churches and chapels and    
 these serve most denominations. Most  
 of the chapels have been established  
 for a number of years and the services
 are still mainly conducted through the
 medium of Welsh in most.              </content>
