		<title>16Crosskeys Rugby Club</title>
		<content>  Crosskeys can boast that it is the   
 smallest village in Wales to have a   
 first class rugby club - and 1985 is  
 its centenary!                        
  The club began with just a field and 
 the players had to wash in the local  
 pubs after the game. In 1929 Lord     
 Tredegar donated a local farmhouse to 
 be converted to a clubhouse and       
 bowling greens and tennis courts were 
 also added. The present clubhouse was 
 built in the early 1980's when the old
 one was demolished to make way for the
 new by-pass. A local man, Mr. Jack    
 Tamlyn, played for the club for some  
 years as a prop forward, joining in   
 1956. This was also the year when the 
 last Crosskeys player - Rex Richards -
 won a full Welsh cap. It is the local 
 opinion that the club's relative      
 decline after this followed the       
 decline of mining.                    </content>
