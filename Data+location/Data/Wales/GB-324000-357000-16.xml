		<title>16Family Life in Leeswood</title>
		<content>   There is a variety of life_styles   
 enjoyed by people in this area.Some   
 people are quite rich,others are quite
 poor.The working class houses are     
 ordinary with a living room,kitchen,  
 bathroom and bedrooms.The same old    
 things happen each day;children go to 
 school,dad goes to work and mum does  
 the housework but sometimes she may go
 out to work.                          
   Pets are kept such as cats,dogs and 
 so on.Occasionally families have the  
 odd day out.Some families do not have 
 any transport but that is quite       
 unusual as most people have cars.     
   T.V. is watched a great deal and    
 videos,computers and other luxuries   
 are appearing in working class homes  
 whereas the more wealthy families     
 think nothing of having luxuries such 
 as videos,computers,big cars and      
 swimming pools.                       </content>
