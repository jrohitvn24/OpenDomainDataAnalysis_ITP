		<content> THIS IS A MOBILE SHOP FOR AND AROUND  
 MARCHWIEL. IT IS USEFUL FOR OLD PEOPLE
 BECAUSE THEY CAN BUY THE FOOD THERE   
 INSTEAD OF WALKING OR PAYING FOR A BUS
 TO WREXHAM. COMPARED TO THE SHOPS HIS 
 PRICES ARE AVERAGE THIS IS SURPRISING 
 BECAUSE HE HAS TO PAY FOR PETROL OUT  
 OF THE MONEY HE MAKES. HE DOES NOT    
 JUST SELL FRUIT HE ALSO SELLS DRINKS  
 AND PLANTS. HE USUALLY HELPS WITH     
 ANNUAL EVENTS LIKE THE CARNIVAL, AND  
 HE IS ALSO VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE     
 VILLAGERS.
