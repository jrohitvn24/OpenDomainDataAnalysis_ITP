		<title>05The cockles of Penclawdd.</title>
		<content> One of our local industries in this   
 area is the collection of cockles.They
 are collected on Llanrhidian and      
 Wernffrwd sands on the North coast of 
 the Gower peninsula.                  
     Most of the collectors are        
 women,they must be very wary of the   
 incoming tide.They also collect       
 seaweed and mussles to make a         
 traditional Welsh dish of larva bread.
 After they collect the cockles,mussles
 and seaweed,they have to take them to 
 the factory to be washed and cleaned, 
 ready to be sold at the market in     
 Swansea.                              
         The cockle women also go      
 around our area selling cockles from  
 their vans,a small bag costs 40p,a    
 wine glass full costs around 35p.     
         The cockle women enjoy their  
 work very much,they are a good example
 of a traditional industry in the area.</content>
