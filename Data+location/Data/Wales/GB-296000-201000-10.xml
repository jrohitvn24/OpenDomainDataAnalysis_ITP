		<title>10Games Children Play</title>
		<content> The children of Cwmdare School play a 
 variety of games in the school yard   
 such as "Touch","Fireball","Traffic   
 Lights","May I","Killer","Polo"and    
 "Corners."The most popular games are  
 "Under The Apple Tree","Link Touch"and
 "King."Some children have invented    
 games such as "Heinz Invaders."       
    To play "Heinz Invaders" one child 
 goes "on it" and has to catch the     
 other children.The child on it counts 
 to 10 and shouts "Heinz Invaders!"The 
 other children have to run.When the   
 child on it catches another child both
 of them go on it.When everyone gets   
 caught the first person who got caught
 goes on it.                           
    These games are played by children 
 from the "Infant"and "Junior"         
 department.They are also played at    
 home or in the street as well as in   
 the school playground.                </content>
