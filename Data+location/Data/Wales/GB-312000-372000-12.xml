		<content> The hedgerows were mainly of hawthorn 
 and hazel with many deciduous trees   
 like oak and sycamore.In the hedges we
 found these wild flowers:-{           
{Sheperd's Purse,Wild Strawberry,Sanide
{Jack-by-the hedge,Crosswort,Common    
{Speedwell,Mouse Ear,Chickweed,Violet, 
{Red Campion,Cow Parsley,Ladies        
{Slipper,Water Avens,Periwinkle,Cow    
{Chevil,Wild Rose and Herb Robert.}    
 We continued over a crossroads and    
 turned left along a footpath back     
 towards Caerwys.We took care not to   
 frighten some milking cows and then   
 entered the town behind St.Micheal's  
 Estate and returned to school via     
 Holywell Road,Drovers Lane and        
 Pen-y-Cefn Road.                      
 The walk was between 2 and 3 miles    
 long and took us nearly two hours.
