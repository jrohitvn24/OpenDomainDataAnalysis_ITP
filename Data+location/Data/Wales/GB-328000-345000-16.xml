		<title>16Social Concerns in Rhos</title>
		<content> Accoring to our survey,people seem to 
 hold very strong feelings for         
 important buildings like the Miners   
 Institute in Rhos.All the people who  
 we asked remembered with fondness ,the
 'stute'in its former glory.           
 The next social concern of Rhos is the
 open cast mmining.It is situated at   
 Maes Einion which is near Hall        
 Street.The National Stripmining       
 Company are applying for permission to
 mine.There is great suspicion about   
 any any company's proposals to create 
 a quarry.This is due to the previous  
 workings at the "Delph"site.This      
 company went broke and failed to      
 redevelop.During a local meeting at   
 the community center there was a      
 unanimous vote agaist the proposal    
 when discussed with councillors.People
 care about jobs but care about their  
 environment more!                     </content>
