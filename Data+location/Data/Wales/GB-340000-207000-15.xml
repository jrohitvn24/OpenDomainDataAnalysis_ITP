		<content>                  {FARMING}            
 The aspect of farming Mr.Bayliss      
 enjoy's most is the constant looking  
 forward.The issues that concern him as
 a farmer revolve chiefly around       
 Britains membership of the Common     
 Market Mr.Bayliss is not happy with   
 a situation where Britain no longer   
 fixes its own prices.He makes the     
 observation that what suits one       
 country does not necessarily suit     
 another. Like all farmers he is       
 concerned about mountains of wheat    
 corn,beef,butter in fact everything   
 except for lamb.In his view the farmer
 who is in the best position is the one
 who has a heavily subsidised poor hill
 farm or alternately the farmer who    
 farms the rich fertile land of East   
 Anglia.Mr.Bayliss concluded farming is
 more uncertain today than it has ever 
 been.                                 </content>
