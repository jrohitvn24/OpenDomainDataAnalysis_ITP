  This area was once extensively mined 
  for both coal and iron ore,for use   
  in the local iron works.The valley,  
  up until the beginning of this cen_  
  tury was covered in coal tips and    
  mine workings.When the industry ran  
  down,these areas were left derelict. 
                                       
           {LANDSCAPE                  
                                       
  Over the last decade,the area has    
  been completely reclaimed.The old    
  tips having been leveled,pools and   
  ponds cleaned and created.Trees have 
  also been planted and the old derel_ 
  ict buildings levelled or made safe. 
  the whole valley has been tured into 
  a recreation park,part of which con_ 
  tains a golf course.
