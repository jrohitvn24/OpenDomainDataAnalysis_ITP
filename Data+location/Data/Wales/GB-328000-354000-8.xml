{Tip:}Three or more players are needed.
 One player is picked to be'on' and    
 counts to ten whilst the other players
 get as far away as possible.Once the  
 count is completed the person who is  
 'on' tries to 'tip'(touch) one of the 
 other players.The first person        
 'tipped' then becomes the next person 
 'on' and the game begins again.       
                                       
{Donkey:}In this game four or more     
 players stand apart and throw a ball  
 to each other.A player who drops the  
 ball becomes a 'D' and is given each  
 of the letters of the word Donkey each
 time the ball is dropped.Once a player
 has spelt 'donkey', he/she is out of  
 the game which continues until only   
 one player is left.
