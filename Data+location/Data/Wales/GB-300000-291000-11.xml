		<title>11      AN INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>  MRS D A NURSE IN THE HOSPITAL DURING 
 WORLD WAR 2 WAS ASKED," WHAT HAPPENED 
 IN{1941}?".                           
  NURSES USED TO PACK THEIR SUITCASES  
 WITH WHATEVER THEY NEEDED AND WHEN THE
 ALARM WENT OFF THEY WOULD TAKE THE    
 PATIENTS DOWN TO THE CELLARS.THEY HAD 
 TO  SLEEP ON VERY UNCOMFORTABLE STRAW 
 MATTRESSES. THE{GERMAN PLANES}WOULD   
 COME OVER BETWEEN 10 AND 12 O'CLOCK AT
 NIGHT. A BOMB DID LAND IN THE FIELD   
 NEXT TO THE HOSPTAL BUT DID NO DAMAGE.
   NURSES USED TO RIDE AROUND THE      
 VILLAGE ON BIKES WITH VERY LOW LIGHTS 
 WHEN THEY WERE ON NIGHT DUTY. EVERY   
 WINDOW IN THE HOSPITAL HAD BLACK      
 CURTAINS SO THAT THE PILOTS WOULD NOT 
 SEE THE HOSPITAL.                     
  WE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE TRAMPS       
 BECAUSE THEY USED TO SLEEP IN THE     
 CELLARS AND IT WAS THE JOB OF THE     
 NURSES TO SEND THEM ON THIER WAY.     </content>
