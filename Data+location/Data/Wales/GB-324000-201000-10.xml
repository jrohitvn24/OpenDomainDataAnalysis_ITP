		<title>10     TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>   We have been conducting a survey of 
{traffic}using the{A4043}in{Pontnewyn- 
{ydd.                                  
  {At 9:00}we counted in 15 minutes,{67
{cars, 1 motorbike 3 vans and a bus    
 using the road between{Pontypool and  
{Abersychan.                           
  {At 1:30.}our count for a quarter of 
 an hour showed{127 cars, 5 motorbikes,
{11 vans and 5 buses}used the road.    
{ At 3:00}we took our last count and in
 15 minutes{125 cars, 4 motorbikes, 25 
{vans, 7 lorries, a minibus and 3 buses
 used the road.                        
  {Paul thought}lunch time was the     
 busiest because people used their cars
 to go to town lunchtime. We noticed   
 that{Welsh Water and Torfaen Authority
 vehicles used the road regularly.     
  {I think}it would be better if there 
 was a{by-pass around Pontypool}so that
 it would't be so busy and dangerous.  </content>
