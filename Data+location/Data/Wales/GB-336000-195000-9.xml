		<title>09Landscape in Llangybi</title>
		<content> Mainly gentle hills divided by hedges 
 into fields for pasture and country   
 lanes with hedges on either side.The  
 hedges in many cases contain mature   
 trees.There are a few deciduous       
 coppices and a small,mainly coniferous
 wood.From the hills on the west side  
 of the village there are extensive    
 views towards the Wentwood Hills.The  
 dual carriageway from Newport to      
 Monmouth can be seen in the Usk River 
 Valley,also the parish churches of    
 Llangybi and Llantrisant.There are    
 water meadows streching almost from   
 the road through the village of       
 Llangybi to the River Usk.In every    
 direction there are farmhouses dotted 
 about.Most of these have large modern 
 barn structures in their yards and a  
 few have silo towers.
