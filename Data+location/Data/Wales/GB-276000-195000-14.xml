 the day hospital.The day unit admits

 by a doctor and may be treated by a   
 physiotherapist, chiropodist or speech
 therapist.They may shower or bath,    
 have lunch and tea.They  go home by   
 ambulance in the evening. Previously  
 the hospital was for tuberculosis but 
 this disease is rare in the area now.
