		<title>04LLANSAMLET PAST AND PRESENT</title>
		<content> Mr Dai Smith was born on January 6th  
 1910.He told me all about the area of 
 Llansamlet, past and present.He said: 
 Llansamlet is a much healthier place  
 now.People would walk along Peniel    
 Green Rd. with hankies over their     
 mouths, to stop the fumes of the      
 copper and smelting getting in.People 
 would die quite young because the     
 smoke and fumes, would give them      
 cancer.Years ago, the houses around   
 the area were all dark brown, this was
 due to the industry.Now, they are     
 bright colours.When you walked into   
 Church Rd., it was like walking into a
 village.The church was always full, so
 were the Sunday schools.Children would
 pay two pence a week to go to school. 
 On Llansamlet square, there used to be
 a little "Green" where the children   
 would play, now it is a flower        
 shop.Llansamlet park was a fair.      </content>
