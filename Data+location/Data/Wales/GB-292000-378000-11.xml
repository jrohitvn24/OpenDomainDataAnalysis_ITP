		<title>11THE STATION.</title>
		<content>    The station of Abergele and Pensarn
 is situated on the North Wales coast  
 line which forms the important link   
 between London and Dublin.The use of  
 the station has declined to the point 
 where the closing of the station would
 not be surprising .                   
    The original track was built by    
 George Stephenson for the Chester to  
 Llandudno Junction railway but was    
 later built up to Holyhead and        
 London.At Holyhead the ships would    
 sail to Kingston-Ireland to join up   
 Dublin by rail to London for trade.   
    The track was built in the 1840's  
 along with the station.Many           
 alterations have been made to the     
 station:platforms and sidings were    
 extended in 1883 and a footbridge was 
 constructed at the same time.Widened  
 lines and a new station were brought  
 into use in July 1902.                </content>
