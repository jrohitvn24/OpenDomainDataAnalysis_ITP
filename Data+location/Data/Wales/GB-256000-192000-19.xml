		<content>{Cila Primary School                   
{ }Opened in 1912, the School caters   
 for children of this village only.    
 Residential development in the 1950's 
 and 1960's necessitated the addition  
 of a pre-fabricated classroom. With a 
 decline in the number of children in  
 recent years it has been possible to  
 add a nursery class.                  
                                       
{Congregational Chapel                 
{  }Built in 1911,the Chapel facilities
 are used by the local branch of the   
 Women's Institute,Brownies and Guides.
                                       
{Community Centre                      
{  }This was opened in 1981 and is used
 by several local organisations such as
 the Senior Citizens,Mother &amp; Toddler  
 Group,Embroidery and Sewing Club,the  
 Cricket Club and Horticultural        
 Society.                              </content>
