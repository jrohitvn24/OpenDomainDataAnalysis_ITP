		<content> In September 1984 a toddler group was 
 started in the village of Bodfari.It  
 is run by two of the mothers in the   
 village and is open to children aged  
 between two and a half years old and  
 three and a  half years old. The group
 meets two mornings a week on          
 Wednesdays and Fridays in the         
 recreation room opposite Bodfari      
 School.                               
           At the present time there   
 are sixteen toddlers and they spend   
 their time painting and playing with  
 toys.They are also given a snack half 
 way through the session.              
           Many of the toddlers will   
 join the part time  nursery at Ysgol  
 Bodfari at the beginning of the school
 year  they are four years old.
