		<title>07FARMING,DUNVANT AREA.</title>
		<content>   A few small farms remain in the area
 with the emphasis on milk production. 
 Most of the farms were established in 
 the seventeenth century and are       
 mentioned in Cromwell's Survey of     
 1650.Some woodland and rough pasture  
 are to be found on most.              
                                       
   {Killan Fawr Farm.   }This is worthy
 of special note because of its links  
 with the Norman period and, later,    
 with the Knights of the Order of St.  
 John who established a guesthouse for 
 travellers on the site.               
                                       
   {Prior's Wood and Meadow.   }Given  
 to a party of monks by the Normans,the
 land has borne these names throughout 
 the centuries and the links are       
 further perpetuated by the naming of  
 two local roads, Prior's Crescent and 
 Prior's Way.                          </content>
