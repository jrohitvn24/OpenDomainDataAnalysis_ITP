		<title>18An interview with R.M.Owen</title>
		<content>   We asked R.M.Owen,retired headmaster
 and local historian about changes he  
 has seen in our area in :-            
{Education:}Selection testing abolished
 and secondary education now organised 
 on Comprehensive lines.Primary schools
 re-housed in modern buildings.        
{The Castle:}Once swings etc. were pro-
 -vided and children played there.Con- 
 ducted tours now form the main{tourist
 attraction,plus{Cadw's}planned events.
{ The Hospital:}In the treatment of in-
 -mates the emphasis was previously one
 of containment. Nurses were known as  
{keepers,}all wards were locked and    
 discipline was severe. Nowadays a more
 sympathetic approach allows most of   
 the patients more freedom.            
{ The Railway:}'Beeching' cuts in 60's 
 led to the end of this form of trans- 
 -port.A valuable facility was lost and
 the volume of road traffic increased. </content>
