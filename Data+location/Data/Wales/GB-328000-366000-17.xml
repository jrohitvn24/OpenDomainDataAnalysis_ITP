		<content> Deeside high school in Clwyd not only 
 offers education for children from the
 ages of 11 to 18 but also to any      
 person who wishes to use its'         
 facilities. The school has a pupose   
 built community wing with a coffee bar
 which is used daily by the community  
 and a series of rooms which           
 organisations can use.                
 People who wish to gain skills which  
 they did not achieve in their normal  
 schooling are encouraged to come to   
 the school and join in lessons with   
 the pupils. Many courses are offered  
 from Basic maths and English up to    
 subjects at O level and A level.      
 In the evenings many groups such as   
 computer clubs, rugby clubs, wine     
 making groups and cycling clubs use   
 the facilities of the school. This    
 means that the buildings are used for 
 the good of the community at all times</content>
