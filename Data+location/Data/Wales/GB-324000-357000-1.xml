		<title>01Leeswood and district</title>
		<content>  Leeswood is a peaceful place and has 
 many interesting and amusing places.  
  We have a number of picturesque      
 churches and chapels in the area.     
  The best place to look at the beauty 
 of the area is from the top of Hope   
 Mountain from where you can see part  
 of Cheshire and Merseyside.           
  In Coed Talon there is an old railway
 line which used to be in use,but now  
 is shut down.There is now a pub there 
 which is called The Railway Inn to    
 mark the spot.                        
   We have a craft centre on the side  
 of Hope Mountain and also a cafe which
 lots of people go to for dinner or for
 tea.
