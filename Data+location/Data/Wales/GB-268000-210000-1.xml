		<content> An interview with a local farmer.     
 Mr. Glen Davies has lived at          
 Cwmnanthopkin Farm all his life. His  
 family came to live there in 1890 but 
 the farm was mentioned in manorial    
 rolls in 1610.Mr. Davies runs a stock 
 farm on his 7o acres of land. he used 
 to be a dairy farmer but now he runs a
 suckler calf system. he has 75 cows   
 and calves, Herefords, Friesians,and  
 Aberdeen Angus crossed with a         
 Charolais bull.He takes his calves to 
 Carmarthen market to sell them.       
 Although he has two tractors, a JCB   
 and a trailer, he employs a contractor
 to make the silage to feed his stock  
 in the winter.Cwmnanthopkin is one of 
 eleven farms on the Penlerfedwen      
 Mountain, most of which is owned by   
 the NCB.
