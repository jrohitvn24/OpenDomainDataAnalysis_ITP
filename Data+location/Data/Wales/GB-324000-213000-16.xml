		<title>16RECREATION &amp; LEISURE SURVEY</title>
		<content> A survey was carried out during June  
 1985 on the leisure and recreation    
 activites of pupils in Govilon Primary
 School(class 4).The results were as   
 follows.Most of the pupils in class 4 
 of Govilon Primary School stated      
 watching television and reading were  
 their favourite pastimes.The          
 other pastime most people             
 liked doing was cycling.Many other    
 activities were listed from fishing to
 using a computer, to other things like
 listening to tapes and records.Only a 
 few  people took part in              
 Scouts,Cubs,Girl Guides and Brownies, 
 which was very surprising.In the      
 nearby town of Abergavenny there is a 
 Leisure Centre.It has many activities 
 for instance a swimming pool,squash   
 courts,gymnasium,cafeteria etc.However
 only 4 people in the class use the    
 Leisure Centre more than once a week. </content>
