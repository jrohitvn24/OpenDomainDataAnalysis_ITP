		<content> Rossett, Lavister, Pulford and Poulton
 lie directly on the border between    
 England and Wales.  They are situated 
 on the main Chester to Wrexham road   
 except for Poulton which is situated  
 'behind' Pulford.  They are about six 
 miles from Wrexham and five miles from
 Chester.                              
                                       
 The main employment in the area,      
 especially in Poulton is farming.     
 Most people living in the area travel 
 to other places to work. The rate of  
 unemployment is very low compared to  
 Wrexham.                              
                                       
 Most of Rossett, Lavister and part of 
 Pulford is made up of residential     
 areas whereas Poulton and the rest of 
 Pulford is made up of farming         
 communities.
