		<title>19Medical Services in StDavids</title>
		<content> Doctor Middleton is the G.P.in        
 St.Davids.He has 2200 patients on his 
 books and on a busy day he has up to  
 60 patients in his surgery.The doctor 
 has a special radio in his car so that
 he can speak to ambulance men if he   
 needs them. He usually reaches people,
 but in the winter when there is       
 snow on the ground if he was needed   
 badly he would go by                  
 helicopter,tractor or he would borrow 
 a Landrover.In 1982 there was a person
 who he could manage to reach as there 
 were snow drifts of two to four       
 feet.The farthest daily call was      
 420 miles there and 420 miles         
 back.This was by helicopter to an     
 injured man on a ship off Ireland.    
 e.He works in the surgery from 9.00am 
 till 10.30am then he goes on his      
 rounds The surgery opens again at     
 600pm.                                </content>
