		<content> Cockett Police Station is J Division  
 Headquarters for Glamorgan Police     
 Constabulary. The Police at Cockett   
 are responsible for motorway patrols  
 on the M4.There is a C.I.D. office and
 police cells. Alsatians and labradors 
 are used in police work and their     
 handlers look after them at home.     
 There are several community policemen,
 who work from smaller stations and    
 police houses. They attend Community  
 Council meetings,visit schools and    
 patrol their areas on foot, using     
 radios to contact their H.Q. They can 
 use police cars if necessary.         
 In this force the policemen wear      
 helmets rather than flat caps and are 
 allowed to wear spectacles.           
 Generally, this area is fairly        
 law-abiding,burglary and vandalism    
 being the main problems for the       
 police.                               </content>
