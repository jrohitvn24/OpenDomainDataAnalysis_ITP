		<title>11Work on a typical local farm</title>
		<content>  I live on a typical mixed farm in the
area.We have 400 ewes,30 rams and 50   
cattle.We grow 8 acres of corn.        
  Two workers are employed on the farm 
and they start work at 7.30a.m. and    
finish at about 6.00p.m..In the Spring,
at lambing time, the men work in       
shifts,with 1 working during the day,  
and 1 at night.The fattened lambs and  
calves are sold at either Hereford or  
Ross Market in the Autumn.             
  Shearing in late Spring normally     
takes a week and uses a lot of labour  
who work long hours.Some farms hire    
contractors to do the shearing.Feeding 
the animals is expensive and many      
farmers make silage to save costs.Hay  
and silage making take up much of the  
summer months.Then the land is ploughed
and resown.                            
  The modern farmer must be cost       
effective and work hard to succeed.    </content>
