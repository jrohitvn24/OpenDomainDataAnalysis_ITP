		<title>13ARTS AND CRAFTS</title>
		<content> An interesting development has been   
 the creation of a form of arts and    
 crafts co-operative in the village    
 which is based upon an old chapel.    
 Amongst the activities here are silver
 and leather working and fabric design 
 and printing.  The building is open   
 in most days during the summer six    
 months and, of course the products are
 for sale.                             
                                       
 There is a pottery based upon the old 
 stables block at Llwyn Cyntefin.  This
 may also be visited by arrangement.
