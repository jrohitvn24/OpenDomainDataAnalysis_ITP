		<content>  A social evening was held at the     
 village hall on 26th July 1985 to mark
 the retirement of the local Vicar,Rev.
 A.W.McAdam.                           
  The local people raised over Â£550 to 
 buy him a music centre.               
  During the evening a local artist,   
 Mr.Sweetingham,gave an amusing account
 of various stages and happenings in   
 the Vicar's life.He had portrayed     
 these events in cartoons which were   
 displayed for all the gathering to    
 enjoy.Mrs McAdam was presented with a 
 portrait of her husband which had been
 painted by the same artist.           
  A splendid buffet was provided for   
 everyone. The evening ended with      
 a glass of sherry and a piece of cake,
 and the toast-'Happy Birthday,Vicar'. 
  Mr and Mrs McAdam will continue to   
 live in Grosmont.
