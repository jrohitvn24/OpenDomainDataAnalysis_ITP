		<title>01General Review of area.</title>
		<content> Our area is one of rolling hills      
 overlooking a wide river valley.The   
 hills are cut by deep wooded dingles  
 with streams flowing down to the{River
{Wye.                                  
 There are only two small villages,    
{Llowes and Ffynnon Gynydd.            
 It is predominantly a farming area.   
 The only heavy industry is that of a  
 constructional engineer who builds    
 barns and repairs farm machinery.     
 The River Wye provides recreation for 
 many.Local outward bound schools use  
 it for canoeing.There is an annual    
 raft race.The fishing rights are      
 privately owned.The Wye is noted for  
 its Spring salmon.                    
 It is an area of great beauty with    
 panoramic views of the Black Mountains
 and the Brecon Beacons.               
 The{Maesllwch Estate}owns a large     
 percentage of our area.               </content>
