		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF HOLYWELL</title>
		<content> The limestone plateau of Halkyn       
 Mountain dominates our area,reaching a
{height of 837ft}at Penyball.This is   
 open country dotted with outcrops of  
 Carboniferous limestone.Falling to    
 about{500ft,}the line of the A55 Road 
 to Holywell skirts the plateau.Several
 streams cut into the lower slopes of  
 the Holywell shales  and coal measures
 which fall more gently to the Dee fore
 shore.These valleys are deep and well 
 wooded and the most significant is    
 that leading from Holywell known as   
 the{Greenfield Valley.}This is        
 followed by the stream derived from   
{the Well}from which Holywell takes    
 its name. Clays,sands and pebbles are 
 found covering the area,left by the   
 Pleistocene Glaciation.The Dee fore-  
 shore is reclaimed marshland and the  
 steep slope on the A548 at Greenfield 
 marks the former cliff coastline.     </content>
