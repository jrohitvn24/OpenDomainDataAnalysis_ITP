		<title>08BODAFON HALL FARM</title>
		<content> Bodafon Hall Farm is a farm of about  
 150 acres which specialises in{dairy  
 farming.The pedigree herd of seventy  
{British Friesians }has been built up  
 over the past fifty years by the      
 present tenant whose family have      
 farmed the land since 1876. All{fodder
 for the animals is produced on the    
 farm; grazing during the summer months
 and silage during the winter months   
 when the cattle have free access to   
 sheds for shelter from the prevailing 
 north and north-westerly winds.       
{Each animal}produces an average of    
{5500 litres of milk per year.}This is 
 sent to the local creamery for pasteur
 isation and then is mostly sent for   
 processing. In the summer months      
 some returns to the area as liquid    
 milk for the large influx of tourists.
