		<content>   I am Nicky. It is November 1st 1985.
 I live in{Rhossilli,}a rural village  
 on the{Gower peninsula.}My father is a
 farmer and sometimes I help him on the
 farm. The place in which I live is    
 very nice as it is a mixture between  
 country and beach land. My father owns
 a Ford Escort car and every Tuesday my
 mother drives 20 miles to town to get 
 the food for the following week. Last 
 night, October 31st, I went to a      
 Halloweeen party. Halloween celebrates
{All Hallows Eve}when all the witches  
 and ghosts are supposed to come out   
 and spook all the humans that are out.
 I went out to a party where I was     
 ducking apples and eating hot dogs.   
   Some people complain that there     
 isn't much to do in our area but      
 although it's fairly quiet I enjoy the
 peace and beauty of the landscape.
