		<title>16Brownie Pantomines</title>
		<content>   The first Brownie Panto's started in
 1970 because Mrs.Anne Stewart and Mrs.
 Abraham wanted a change from native   
 plays. The dresses were the same as   
 now and they acted the usual fairy    
 tales like Cinderella and Alladin.    
 They Have always been held in the     
 Vernon Institute and they were put on 
 to entertain the over-sixties, but now
 it is for fund-raising. The plays have
 always been acted very well. Mrs.     
 Stewart was never in any of the       
 pantos in Saughall. The Mayor went    
 every year to see them and sometimes  
 the Sheriff did. It was Mrs.Abrahams  
 idea to start the pantos and Mr.      
 Murphy has always written the scripts.
 The pantos have a been held at        
 Christmas, on the weekend of the      
 Golden Link Party. There are normally 
 24 people in the plays.
