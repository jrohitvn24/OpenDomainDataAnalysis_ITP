		<title>06FARMING AROUND LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> Farms, varying from 20-70 acres, rain-
 fall 35"-40", from sea-level to 500'. 
 Of the 21 farms, 6 are Friesian dairy 
 (3 are County Council Smallholdings), 
 15 beef with sheep and corn on some.  
 All except Council farms are owner-   
 occupied, none employ labour.  Fields 
 usually 3-12 acres, many less than 5. 
 Some of Laugharne Corporation land,   
 167 acres at Hugdon (from Norman      
 Knight, Hugh's Down) is owned by      
 burgesses during their lifetime,      
 grazed communally Nov/Jan and farmed  
 in 1-3 acre strips by cropping for hay
 or silage during season.  Milk        
 collected daily by MMB tankers, sheep 
 and calves taken by horse-box or      
 similar to St Clears weekly mart, cows
 and store cattle by lorry to          
 Carmarthen.  Milk quotas/wet summer   
 1985 causing problems.  Two local     
 farmers do most of hay-baling.        </content>
