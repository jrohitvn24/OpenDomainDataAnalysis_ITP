 there are a variety of shops, Gateway 
 Supermarket, chemists,shoe shops,     
 butchers, bakers, newsagents,         
 hairdressers, carpet shop, children's 
 clothes shop, photographers,          
 greengrocers, wallpaper shop and      
 ironmongers.  There are fish &amp; chip   
 and Indian restaurants, a Chinese     
 takeaway and a small cafe.  For bulk  
 buying, variety and competitive prices
 villagers have to travel outside the  
 area to larger superstores eg. Asda &amp; 
 Tesco.These  larger stores also sell  
 household items eg. paint, wallpaper, 
 tools, toys, clothing and footwear.   
 Neath or Swansea have to be visited if
 a greater selection is required.      </content>
