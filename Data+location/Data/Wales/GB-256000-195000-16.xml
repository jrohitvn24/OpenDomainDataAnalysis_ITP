		<title>16Gowerton Riding Centre.</title>
		<content> Gowerton Riding Centre is one of the  
 local tourist attractions in our area.
 They have twenty six horses and a few 
 ponies in the stables.                
        The lessons cost Â£3.50 for a   
 private half hour lesson and Â£3.50 for
 an hour if you are part of a class.The
 Centre also caters for resedential    
 courses where you can camp on the farm
 and have riding lessons too.          
         The Centre has a tack room    
 where they keep all the equipment and 
 a feed shed where the food such as    
 bran,barley oats and horsenuts are    
 kept.The vet comes every fortnight to 
 check the health of the horses and to 
 see that they are not working too     
 hard.The stables are mucked out every 
 day and disinfected at the weekend so 
 the horses are kept very clean.After  
 their working life is over the horses 
 are sold to a good,caring home.       </content>
