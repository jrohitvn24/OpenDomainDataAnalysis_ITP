		<content> The majority of the people speak{Welsh
 although the number of English and non
 Welsh speaking immigrants is          
 increasing annually.This effects the  
 percentage of Welsh speakers in the   
 area.                                 
      The number of Welsh speakers in  
 the area of{Glyndwr District Council  
 has fallen from{61.7% in 1951 to 43.3%
{in 1981.}However,it must be remembered
 that the area in the square is one of 
 the most "Welsh" in the Glyndwr area. 
        Every child which leaves       
 Pentrecelyn Primary School is         
{bilingual,and out of the 97 children} 
 at school 60 hear Welsh at home.This  
 is{61.1%.                             
        The local population(i.e. those
 who have lived here for generations)  
 are all Welsh speakers.The field names
 and farm names are all in Welsh.      
      What will be spoken here in 2085?</content>
