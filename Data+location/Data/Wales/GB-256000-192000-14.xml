		<title>14PRIMARY SCHOOL,THREE CROSSES</title>
		<content> Three Crosses,or Crwys, Primary School
 celebrated its centenary in 1975.In   
 1918 its catchment area was extended  
 to include part of Dunvant.With       
 extensive housing development in      
 Dunvant during the 1950's and 1960's  
 the School premises were inadequate to
 house all the pupils.In 1972 Glamorgan
 Education Authority opened a new      
 school at Dunvant for the children of 
 that area.The number of children      
 attending Crwys School was therefore  
 cut dramatically and the School       
 reverted to its original role of      
 catering for its own village children 
 including those of nursery age.Sports 
 facilities are limited,use having to  
 be made of the village green or 'Banc'
 as it is known,any inter-school foot- 
 ball matches having to be arranged on 
 pitches some distance from the        
 village.                              </content>
