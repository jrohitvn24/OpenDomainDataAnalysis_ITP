		<title>18The Court Leet 'B'.</title>
		<content> This second court,the Area Court,met  
 once a fortnight with the Mayor as a  
 Chairman.Its most important task was  
 to try trespassers,debtors,slanderers 
 etc.and settle any arguement that     
 arose.The fines given to wrong-doers  
 went into the pocket of the Lord.     
 As in olden times,the Lady Marcher of 
 Cemais still appoints her Mayor my    
 receiving three nominations from her  
 Burgesses and making her own          
 selection,nearly everything else has  
 changed.Burgesses are still           
 appointed,the Court Leet still meets  
 and acts in the interest of the Lady  
 Marcher and the town.                 
 Few such Courts remain by today and   
 Newport is virtually unique in having 
 its Mayor 'made' in early             
 November(same date as London's Lord   
 Mayor).Virtually all other Mayors are 
 now Town Mayors 'made'in May each year</content>
