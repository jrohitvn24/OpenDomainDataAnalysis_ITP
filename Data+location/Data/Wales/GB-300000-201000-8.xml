		<content>{SHOPPING SURVEY (cont'd)              
  Most of the shoppers had travelled to
 the centre either by car or bus,some  
 of them travelling up to 5 miles.The  
 future of the centre could therefore  
 depend upon the provision of improved 
 car parking facilities and local bus  
 services.Already there are problems   
 with the annexing of the Ynys car park
 by the new Aberdare by-pass.This area 
 may now only be reached by a high foot
 bridge.                               
  In the last 3 years some supermarkets
 have moved out of the centre into the 
 surrounding residential districts.Here
 they provide car parks and in some    
 cases a free bus service e.g.         
 Kwiksave.In the survey 8% of those    
 surveyed bought the bulk of their     
 shopping in these supermarkets,a trend
 which could threaten the future of    
 shopping in Aberdare centre.          </content>
