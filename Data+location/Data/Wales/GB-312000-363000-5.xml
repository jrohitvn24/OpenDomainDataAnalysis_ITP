		<content>   HOUSES (TYPES).                     
    The homes in the area are well     
 maintained and are roughly of two     
 categories. Scattered small farm      
 houses, working farms, and the small  
 hamlets of the area, with the farm    
 workers cottages or cottages that have
 been modernised, and extended, for the
 commuters living in the area.         
   SERVICES.                           
    The area benefits from an          
 electricity supply, brought by pylon  
 and has mains water, but there is no  
 gas supply or sewage system, for the  
 latter, homes depend on septic tanks  
 and the 'night soil service'.         
   TRANSPORT.                          
    There is a bus service (no 76),    
 which runs four times a day between   
 Ruthin and Denbigh.
