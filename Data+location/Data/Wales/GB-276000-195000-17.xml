		<title>17HOBBIES IN CIMLA</title>
		<content> Children in class 4H,Crynallt Junior  
 school, carried out a survey into the 
 leisure activities of the members of  
 their families.They found that most   
 people had at least one hobby or      
 interest.The list of hobbies included 
 reading,needlework,fishing,playing    
 rugby and soccer football,playing     
 chess,cricket,cooking,art and craft,  
 computing,jogging,model-making,stamp- 
 collecting,shell-collecting and fossil
 collecting.Wine-making and keeping-fit
 was popular with adults and children  
 enjoyed "collecting".Two boys had     
 rather unusual hobbies,one enjoyed    
 motor-bike scrambling,the other was a 
 keen "annual"collector.The annuals he 
 collects are comic annuals like Beano,
 Sparky,Dandy,Topper and Beezer.He has 
 a lot of the early annuals and he has 
 almost every Beano annual since it was
 launched in 1938.                     </content>
