		<content>{Nimbus Records}employ about 65 people.
 The company (see page 16) produces:   
     1.{L.P. Records-}one record is    
 produced every 30 seconds and they    
 operate from 0700-1800. This analogue 
 disc technique is being replaced by:  
     2.{5 inch Laser Discs.}These are  
 made of{poly carbonate}which has      
 minute dots and dashes for the laser  
 to read. It is called a{digital disc} 
 and because it is read by a laser it  
 does not wear out and is very         
 difficult to damage.{Wyastone Leys    
 is the only factory in G.B. and is one
 of only 3 in Europe.(France,W.Germany)
 The discs are made in a modern unit   
 which has to be totally free of dust. 
 The air in the factory is 100 times   
 cleaner than in an operating theatre.{
 The discs can store pictures and words
 as well as sound-{Nimbus Records think
{it is the technology of the future.   </content>
