		<content>   In my dad's spare time he cuts      
 the lawn and waters the garden if it  
 hasn't rained.He cleans the garden if 
 it is untidy with crisp packets and   
 many other things.                    
   In my mam's spare time she reads    
 books written by Agatha Cristie.      
 She also weeds the garden and goes to 
 see my nana.When she goes to bed she  
 takes a book to read.                 
{Michael's spare-time activities.      
  On Sunday I go with my friends       
 to the fisheries. When we  get there  
 we should see a big place where you go
 fishing.Before we come to the fishing 
 pond we see a place where they sell   
 fish. When we get there we go on a    
 raft made of wood into the water.We go
 for a walk in the woods. After we have
 been in woods we go to Ysceifiog to   
 play in the park and talk to the      
 people there then we go home.         </content>
