 was illegal.Then the men would go up  
 the wood and start again.             
       For entertainment the kids would
 go to the cinema,there was one in     
 Newbridge which I used to go to called
 The Grand.It was by the Redifussion   
 offices next to the river,and I can   
 remember the rats coming in.I never   
 had any money,so,I would sneak in     
 through the side door .The kids used  
 to walk from Crumlin and Abercarn to  
 go to the Grand,they did not catch the
 bus like they do now.People used to   
 travel everywhere on bikes,though     
 there were a few utility buses from   
 Blackwood.They used these to go to the
 village to do their shopping,though   
 most people used the corner shops.    </content>
