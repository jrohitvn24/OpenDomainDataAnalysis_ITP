		<title>16THE JONES</title>
		<content> Stuart Jones is a member of a family  
 of seven which is unusual this days.  
 Mr Jones is a builder and his wife    
 stays at home but takes an active part
 in local affairs and school life - she
 teaches netball. Sunday begins with a 
 lie in followed by a cooked breakfast.
 The children and their mother go to   
 Llanbedr Church for the 10.30 service.
 Dad stays at home to read the         
 newspaper. Lunch is often salad on a  
 sunday. Later they watch cartoons on  
 the television and after that they go 
 outside to play. Sunday tea is special
 with jelly, icecream and so on. Sunday
 evenings find most of the family      
 either having a bath or preparing for 
 school the next morning, so bedtime is
 earlier on sundays.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
