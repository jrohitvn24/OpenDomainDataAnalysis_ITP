		<content> The Gellifor School building is very  
 old.The school was opened in 1868,117 
 years ago.It has three classrooms,two 
 of which have been joined.There is a  
 large field,a small yard and a        
 community centre which serves as a    
 school hall and dining room.          
    The school has 43 children,22      
 infants and 21 juniors.Of these,26    
 come to school by car,12 walk,1 comes 
 by bike and 4 by taxi.The children    
 come from Llandyrnog, Llangynhafal,   
 Hendrerwydd and Gellifor itself.There 
 are three teachers, one with the      
 infants and two with the juniors.Four 
 other people work at the school, two  
 in the kitchen,one as secretary and   
 one cleaner.                          
     Most of the children from Gellifor
 go to Brynhyfryd Secondary School in  
 Ruthin, but a few go to Denbigh High  
 School and Ruthin Private School.     </content>
