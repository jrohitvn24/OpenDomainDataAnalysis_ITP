		<content> Our block, on the west side of        
 Carmarthen town, and the river Towy is
 rich in natural beauty, an area       
 consisting of 3/4 agricultural land   
 where mixed farming is carried on with
 emphasis on dairy farming.  The       
 remainder consists of scrubland,      
 deciduous and coniferous woods, and   
 marshlands, found mainly on the banks 
 of the tidal river Towy.  It is       
 sparsely populated, comprising of one 
 small village, the corner of a housing
 estate, a group of modern houses, plus
 farms and cottages dotted over the    
 area.  It lies seven miles from the   
 coast, where the estuary of the Towy  
 meets the sea.  The furtherest point  
 on our block is five miles from the   
 market town of Carmarthen.  The area  
 is linked with Cardiff and Landon by  
 the Fishgruard to London main line    
 railway.                              </content>
