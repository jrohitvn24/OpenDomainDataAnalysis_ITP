		<content> CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL WERE ASKED WHAT
 THEIR PARENTS DID FOR A LIVING.       
 ALTOGETHER 100 CHILDREN WERE ASKED AND
 THE ANSWERS WERE DIVIDED INTO FATHER'S
 AND MOTHER'S OCCUPATIONS.             
 THE SCHOOL WAS BUILT ON AN ESTATE THAT
 WAS MADE TO HOUSE PEOPLE WORKING IN   
 LOCAL INDUSTRY,ESPECIALLY THE NEARBY  
 LLANWERN STEELWORKS.                  
 A CUTTING DOWN ON THE WORKFORCE HAS   
 MEANT A GREAT DEAL OF UNEMPLOYMENT AS 
 MORE MODERN METHODS TAKE THE PLACE OF 
 WORKERS.                              
 THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE FIGURES THAT 
 WERE COLLECTED WITH 32% OF THE FATHERS
 BEING UNEMPLOYED.                     
 OF THE MOTHERS 36% WERE NOW WORKING,  
 PROBABLY TO HELP IN THE RUNNING OF THE
 FAMILY.                               
 IT IS INTERESTING THAT ONLY 18% OF    
 FATHERS NOW WORK IN INDUSTRY.
