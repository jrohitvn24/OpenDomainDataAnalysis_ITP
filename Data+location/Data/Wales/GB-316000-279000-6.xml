		<content>     Although it is in Wales, the      
 Beguildy Parish is served by the      
 Midlands Television Transmitter,      
 so it is impossible to receive B.B.C. 
 Wales or H.T.V. Wales. All of the     
 national newspapers are delivered     
 daily to the village shops in Beguildy
 and Felindre. The evening paper, which
 is also delivered daily,is the        
 Shropshire Star.The local weekly      
 papers are the Mid Wales Journal,     
 which has a local press officer and   
 therefore contains much local news,   
 the County Times and Gazette and the  
 Brecon and Radnor Times. It is        
 possible to obtain a wide variety of  
 stations on the radio but the         
 reception for all Welsh transmissions 
 is poor. A parish magazine is produced
 once a month which contains items of  
 parish news and a wide variety of     
 interesting articles.                 </content>
