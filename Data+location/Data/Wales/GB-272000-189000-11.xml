		<title>11Holy Trinity Church</title>
		<content>   On Wednesday, May 15th. we visited  
 Holy Trinity Church to interview      
 Father Dowding.                       
   When we arrived we looked at the    
 outside of the church.  We noticed the
 spire and read the Service Notice     
 Board.  Father Dowding met us by the  
 gate and we went inside.  Father      
 Dowding told us about the different   
 parts of the church.                  
   Then it was time for the interview. 
 Most of us went into the church hall  
 with Mrs Dowding and                  
  Father Dowding.                      
 We used a tape-recorder to record the 
 interview.                            
   A group of boys were left in the    
 church with Mrs Taylor to sketch parts
 of the church.  When we had finished  
 the interview we returned to the      
 church to ake photographs.
