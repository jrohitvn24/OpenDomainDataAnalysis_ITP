		<content>     My father's spare time is spent   
 working on little projects. At the    
 moment he is restoring an old         
 stationary farm engine called the     
 Wolseley. The machine is fifty years  
 old and at one time it was used to    
 drive a water pump at my grandfather's
 farm. The machine is green in colour. 
 He is also restoring an old water     
 pump. It is hoped that the Wolseley   
 will be shown at a local vintage      
 machinery show next year.             
     My mother's hobbies are cooking   
 and knitting. Her cooking varies from 
 chocolate eclairs to fruit scones. I  
 enjoy cooking with my mum. She has    
 knitted me a jumper and a waistcoat   
 and at the moment she is knitting me  
 another jumper.                       
     My hobbies include pony riding,   
 reading, looking after my pet dog, cat
 and six rabbits.                      </content>
