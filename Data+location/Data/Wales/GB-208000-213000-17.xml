 BETWEEN NARBERTH TOWN MOOR AND VALLEY

 AND PASSES THROUGH QUIET WOODLAND OF  
 DECIDUOUS TREES.MANY FLOWERS GROW     
 ALONG THE PATH INCLUDING,BLUE BELLS,  
 PRIMROSES,WILD ROSE AND VIOLETS.THERE 
 IS A LARGE BADGER SETT QUITE CLOSE TO 
 THE TRACK AND MANY BIRDS SING IN THE  
 BUSHES.A SHORT WALK ALONG VALLEY ROAD 
 TO THE WEST WILL BRING YOU TO CANASTON
 WOODS A LARGE CONIFEROUS FOREST       
 COVERING THE SOUTH WEST CORNER OF OUR 
 BLOCK. THE WOODS ARE CROSSED BY MANY  
 BRIDLE PATHS,ONE OF WHICH BRINGS YOU  
 TO AN ANCIENT HILL FORT.MODERN        
 FORESTERS ARE WORKING CONSTANTLY,     
 FELLING TREES AND MAKING FENCING      
 POSTS AND PIT PROPS.MOUNTAIN CHURCH
