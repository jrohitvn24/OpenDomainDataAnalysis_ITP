		<content> My name is{Steven.}When Iget up in the
 morning I have my breakfast .Then I   
 dress and put the television on.At    
 five to nine I come to school.        
 In the morning we usually do mathe-   
 matics and when we have finished we go
 out to play at 10,45. After play we   
 come in and do some writing or watch a
 T.V. programme until 12 noon.         
 I have sandwiches in school or go home
 for dinner.After dinner we play on    
 the playground if it is dry.          
 In the afternoons we work on projects,
 go swimming,do handwork or art, games 
 or P.E.,music,read,listen to stories  
 and poetry, or change our library     
 books.We have a short afternoon break.
 At 3.30. school finishes and I go     
 home,change and play with my friend   
 Ben.My mum calls me in for tea and    
 afterwards I play with my star wars   
 toys until it is time for bed.        </content>
