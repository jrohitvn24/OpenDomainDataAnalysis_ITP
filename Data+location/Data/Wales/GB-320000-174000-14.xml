		<title>14Sunday Morning in Tremorfa</title>
		<content> We get up in the morning at about     
 8a.m. except my dad,he gets up at     
 about 9.30.He then has his breakfast  
 of bacon ,egg and fried tomatoes.We   
 have cornflakes or toast.Then we get  
 washed and dressed for church and     
 Sunday School.My father goes out at   
 11.30 and he comes back at 3.00 and   
 has his dinner.We come out of Sunday  
 School at 12.15 and then we feed the  
 dog,the cat, the rabbit and the       
 fish.Then we have something to eat    
 ourselves.We sometimes watch a video  
 tape or a film on television.When my  
 father comes in and has his dinner my 
 brother and I call for our friends and
 go out together.When we get in again  
 at about 7.00 we have our tea and then
 we go to bed.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
