		<title>14BIRD LIFE _ FOREST OF DEAN</title>
		<content> This is an outstanding area for birds 
 both in terms of variety and          
 number.The most common bird on the    
 river is the{Mallard Duck}which nests 
 in the woods away from water-loving   
 predators. In the rocks and rapids the
{Dipper}canbe seen. The{Buzzard}is the 
 most common day-time predator and at  
 night many {Owls}can be seen. The     
 forest makes an ideal home for rare   
 birds found only in England and Wales.
 A good example is the{Bowfinch.}The   
 trees form nesting sites for many     
 species and the bird population would 
 be greatly affected by tree felling   
 during the Spring and Summer nesting  
 seasons.To avoid this problem the{    
{Forestry Commission}does most of its  
 felling during the Winter.
