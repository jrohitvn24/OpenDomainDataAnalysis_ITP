		<content> In my spare time there was always     
 plenty to do. I often had to make     
 shirts for my brothers or darn their  
 aprons. One was a blacksmith and the  
 others worked at Gillbertson's        
 tinplate works in Pontardawe. I loved 
 to help out on the local farms        
 particularly raking in the hay.       
     I left school at fourteen. I      
 didn't have a job until I was much    
 older. I stayed at home to help my    
 mother with the housework.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
