		<title>14FARMING IN WISTON cont.</title>
		<content> Secondary cover was woodland,mainly   
 natural deciduous trees,one farmer had
 planted conifers twenty five years ago
 and is now self sufficient in fencing 
 posts,saving 60p per post!            
  Four of the five farmers who produced
 milk expect to be affected by the     
 E.E.C.quotas this year having escaped 
 penalties last year due to the drought
 and the natural decrease in milk      
 production.Farmers are feeling the    
 pinch whatever they do. Few major     
 changes have taken place over the last
 few years.In a farming area only two  
 out of the seven farms still have tied
 cottages.All tractors are British     
 except for one.All of the farmers were
 interestes in wild life and left wood 
 land for conservation areas.They all  
 had foxeson their land and are not    
 very popular.The farmers wives shopped
 mainly in Haverfordwest. THE END.     </content>
