		<title>15The Garway Questionnaire</title>
		<content> We sent out questionnaires to the 92  
 houses in our 12 square kilometre     
 patch. The only places left out were  
 those known to be empty, holiday homes
 or derelict. 59 of these sheets have  
 been returned. One other was handed   
 back completely blank because the     
 person who received it thought it was 
 a Government plot to find out personal
 information about her. It included a  
 housing survey, a population and age  
 distribution survey and a shopping    
 survey. Two of us went round          
 delivering them with the school       
 secretary. We could not deliver at    
 one farm because the dogs were too    
 fierce, so we sent that form by       
 post.The milkman collected about a    
 dozen of the completed forms, and Mrs 
 Smith at the Post Office collected    
 about 30. The remainder were brought  
 in individually.                      </content>
