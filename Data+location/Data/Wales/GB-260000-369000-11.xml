		<content>       Mr.Williams has about nine      
 hundred breeding ewes and 39 breeding 
 rams. This year (1985) his lambing    
 percentage was 135%. He also keeps 108
 Fresian milking cows at about 2 years 
 6 months old.                         
       To control his stock, he has    
 five sheep dogs, which he uses to move
 his sheep from one field to the next. 
       A new milking parlour has just  
 been built. It is a modern system     
 called herring bone because it is     
 spaced out and shaped like one. There 
 is a pit in between the two rows of   
 milking equipment and it makes the    
 men's jobs much easier.
