		<title>08COLWYN BAY BEACH</title>
		<content> Colwyn Bay beach has large stretches  
 of sand.It also has rocks and rock    
 pools,and old wooden groynes going all
 along the beach. It is important that 
 the beach is kept clean and free from 
 pollution especially as Colwyn Bay is 
 a holiday resort.                     
 The beach is usually free from litter 
 but we have found broken glass,drinks 
 cans,steel wire and rusty iron in     
 places.The sewage from the town goes  
 into the sea.The disposal pipe is near
 Rhos Point.It is six hundred metres   
 long.The sewage is released into the  
 sea at high tide and flows North West,
 away from the beach into the Irish    
 Sea.In the early summer we sometimes  
 get an algal bloom on the sea and the 
 beach.This comes from millions of tiny
 algae.When they die and decompose they
 cause lots of brown and white froth to
 form and this creates a pungent smell.</content>
