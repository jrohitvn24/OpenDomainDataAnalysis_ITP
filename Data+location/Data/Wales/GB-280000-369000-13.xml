		<title>13TV Viewing in Eglwysbach</title>
		<content> Television starts in the morning at   
 six thirty with the TVam programme and
 finishes at about midnight. As soon as
 I get home, my mum is watching either 
 Young Doctors or Sons and Daughters   
 and then I watch Children's ITV. It is
 fab on Wednesdays and Thursdays. At   
 six o'clock I watch Brookside on S4C. 
 I like cartoons like Road Runner and  
 Bugs Bunny and comedies like Carry on 
 Laughing but I think drama stories are
 very boring. The best comedy or film  
 starts at about half past seven to    
 about half past ten.                  
 Sport on television is very good as   
 well. I like snooker. My favourite    
 programmes are Coronation Street and  
 East Enders. In our house my mum has  
 always got the television on but I    
 think it is brilliant.
