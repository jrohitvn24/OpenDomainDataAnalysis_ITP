		<content> Aberaeron is still quite              
 uncommercialized with a very          
 attractive harbour.The character of   
 the town,especially the house types,is
 a very important tourist attraction.  
 Domestic visitors represent the most  
 important component of tourism.A      
 number of tourists were interviewed.  
 They all found Aberaeron extremely    
 attractive and liked it very much.Over
 half had been before and only 2 out of
 16 said they would not come again.    
 The sea,the quiet,and the scenery were
 the main attractions and of the 16    
 interveiwed, 6 came from the          
 Midlands,4 from the South West,2 from 
 Liverpool, and the rest from Wales.   
 Tourism is vital to the economy of    
 Aberaeron and is becoming busier every
 year.More shops were turning towards  
 the holiday trade and it is extremely 
 crowded during July and August.       </content>
