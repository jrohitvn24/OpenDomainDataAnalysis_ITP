      My dad was a teacher and was sent
 out to Africa.There he met my{mother} 
 and they were married ,bought a{house}
 and my mother gave birth to my        
 sister-Catherine.When they came to    
 Britain they bought a bungalow at     
 Butterslade Grove where I was soon    
 born.                                 
     I moved to Glyncollen School as   
 soon as it opened as it was nearer    
 than Ynystawe,two months later we     
 moved onto the new Wimpey estate      
 because we needed a bigger house.We   
 had a{piano}which used to be in my    
 room but now it's in the dining area. 
    There is much more room ,but I     
 prefer a bungalow myself.
