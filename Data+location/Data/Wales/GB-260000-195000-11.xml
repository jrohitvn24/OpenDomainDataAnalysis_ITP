		<content> We studied our local newspaper,{The   
{Evening Post,}for a period of a       
 fortnight beginning April 29th.There  
 were three main stories during this   
 period.The first was all about the    
 local County Council Elections. Three 
 Labour councillors were elected for   
 our ward which is called the Penderry 
 Ward.They are John Allison, Tom Jones 
 and Gwylfa Thomas. County Councillor  
 John Allison is also leader of the    
{Labour Party}in West Glamorgan while  
 the Councillor Gwylfa Thomas has      
 become chairman of{West Glamorgan     
{County Council.}The other two stories 
 both told of vandalism and roaming    
 cows and horses.Vandals have damaged  
 farm fences allowing animals to       
 wander. Cows and horses then frighten 
 old people and cause damage to        
 peoples' gardens.
