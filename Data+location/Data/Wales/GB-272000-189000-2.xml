		<title>02The River Afan</title>
		<content>                                       
   Today's Afan is a far cry from the  
 coal-ridden,effluent outlet of 1951.  
 This is largely due to the efforts of 
 the Afan Valley Angling Club assisted 
 by the Welsh Water Aurhority. Despite 
 the difficulties which emanated from  
 coal,iron, and sewage pollution, a    
 series of five-year plans have given  
 the Afan a new potential which has    
 since been realised.                  
     The river is being devloped as a  
 migratory fishery and at the same time
 caters for the needs of the trout     
 angler.                               
       The construction of a fish pass 
 and readjustment or gradients have    
 opened the river up to migratory      
 salmonids to enter the whole of the   
 Afan system, thus offering            
 high expectations for the future.
