		<title>02Life in our block.</title>
		<content>  Our block lies a few miles North of  
 Merthyr Tydfil the town of Tydfil the 
 martyr whom it is said was murdered   
 and buried where the town now stands  
 The town was also famous for its iron 
 and steel industry.Nowadays much of   
 its heavy industry has gone and now   
 the town depends on light industry for
 jobs.The main factory in the town is  
 the Hoover washing machine factory    
 which once gave 5000 people jobs.But  
 now many of these jobs have been lost 
 and there are many people out of work.
 Our block includes the old and new    
 parts of Merthyr.The new is seen in   
 the large modern housing estate of the
 Gurnos.The old area is the Dowlais    
 area.Here the old ironworkers cottages
 are built in terraces.Some with their 
 strange names like Alphonso Street    
 remind us of the people who came from 
 Spain,Ireland to work in the ironworks</content>
