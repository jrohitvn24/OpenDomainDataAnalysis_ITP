		<content> Around fifty years ago most people    
 were welsh speaking however this has  
 greatly changed. Many English families
 have moved into the area and it has   
 become far more Angliced.Today 50% of 
 the people in our block are welsh     
 speaking and eventhough all the       
 children are taught Welsh as a second 
 langauge the playground the language  
 today is English. The Welsh are very  
 proud of thier language and try to    
 keep it alive in the local            
 Chapels;there is an annual Eisteddfod 
 held in the local hall.Many people    
 especially the elderly still prefere  
 to speak welsh and many shops and     
 officers in the local towns insist    
 that there employees are welsh        
 speaking.On St David's Day the        
 children of the area dress in         
 traditional Welsh costume wear leeks  
 and daffodils and sing and recite.    </content>
