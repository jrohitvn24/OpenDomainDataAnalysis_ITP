		<title>17LEARNING IN WELSH</title>
		<content> Despite most adults speaking English  
 only, the area is able to provide a   
 complete education up to University   
 level in Welsh. The continuing growth 
 of these schools shows the desire of  
 young parents to maintain and         
 encourage the use of the Welsh        
 language which had almost become      
 obsolete in this area.                
 There are nursery schools where       
 children begin to learn the language  
 from the age of three and then        
 progress to a Welsh language unit at a
 local primary school or to Welsh only 
 primary schools in other areas.       
 Secondary education can now be        
 undertaken at a Welsh language        
 comprehensive school at Rhydfelen     
 which has been developing for the last
 15 years and now teaches only through 
 the medium of Welsh.
