		<content>   We are lucky to have the Maldwyn    
 Sports Centre in our area.There you   
 can{swim,play squash,badminton,table  
{tennis, basket ball,indoor football   
 and lots of other sports.Also you can 
 use the multi-gym and keep fit to     
 music.                                
    Our school uses the centre for     
 swimming and badminton.I do badminton 
 twice a week,on Wednesday evening and 
 Friday lunchimes.                     
    When we interviewed the manager we 
 asked him why so many people use the  
{centre.He said he thought it was      
{because lots of people now think that 
{exercise is important.On the way in   
 there is a machine that measures your 
 heart-beat.In the mornings unemployed 
 people use the centre and during the  
 school holidays there is a playscool  
 there.
