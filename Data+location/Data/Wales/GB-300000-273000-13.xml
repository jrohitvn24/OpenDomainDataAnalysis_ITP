		<title>13Climate in Bwlchysarnau</title>
		<content> The climate of the area is affected by
 the altitude (300-490m) which lowers  
 tempuratures and increases rainfall,  
 and snowfall in the winter months. The
 roads are often blocked with snow any 
 time from November to May, but the    
 Council snowplough usually copes      
 within 24 hours.                      
    The growing season is very short   
 and most flowers bloom at least 2     
 weeks behind the lowland areas. A     
 frost has been recorded in every month
 of the year at the university Plant   
 Breeding Station, Pantydwr, 1\ miles  
 to the West and strong winds are often
 a problem in the higher, exposed parts
 particularly.
