		<title>05TWO GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> FIREBALL_To play this game the        
 children make a circle by holding     
 hands.Then they drop their hands and  
 pass the ball around the circle in a  
 clockwise direction.If you drop the   
 ball you have to run round the outside
 of the circle while the rest pass the 
 ball round.If they beat you to your   
 place you are out .The game goes on   
 until there is only one person left in
 the circle and that child is the      
 winner.OSTIN YARD _First you draw 2   
 parallel chalk lines 8 metres apart.  
 One child stands between the 2 lines  
 whilst the other children try to run  
 across from one line to the other     
 without being caught by the one in the
 middle.Anybody caught has to help to  
 catch the other children.The winner is
 the one who is caught last of all.The 
 first one to be caught is on it for   
 the next game.                        </content>
