		<title>10ABERDYFI CHILDHOOD (1910)</title>
		<content>{   Mr.H.M.Lewis,born in Aberdyfi in   
{the year 1910,recalled his childhood  
{during a talk to school children on   
{3rd June 1985.                        
    Homelife was mostly happy and      
 simple.Although families were poor the
 children were almost always clean and 
 well fed.Few homes had bathrooms and  
 the weekly bath was taken in front of 
 the kitchen fire on a Saturday evening
 Everyone used the same water in a     
 small tin bath.A fresh kettle of      
 boiling water was used to heat up the 
 bath for the next child.              
    Children had to make their own     
 entertainment.In the summer months    
 water games were popular.A game called
 'DUCK'in which a good swimmer had to  
 dive and swim under water to avoid    
 capture was always great fun.During   
 the winter evenings they played round 
 the kitchen fire with toy soldiers.   </content>
