		<title>11THE LIFEBOAT CREW, RHYL</title>
		<content>  The "Harlil" can carry 35 people in  
 addition to its crew of 7. The crew   
 are all volunteers with other         
 occupations. Only the mechanic is paid
 by the R.N.L.I. for 4 hours work      
 daily. No ladies are in the present   
 crew but there was one on the inshore 
 boat in the 1970s. Training exercises 
 take place every six weeks.           
  Since June, 1982, personal bleepers  
 have been used to call out the men.   
 Before this 2 rockets were fired but  
 these are used tday merely to inform  
 the public of a launch. The Holyhead  
 Coastguard informs the Hon. Sec. when 
 a boat is required. An auxillary      
 coastguard station at the Lifeboat    
 station is only manned in bad weather 
 and at rescue times. An amphibious    
 tractor launches the boat which only  
 requires 1 metre of water. Launching  
 takes 4-7 mins. according to the tide.</content>
