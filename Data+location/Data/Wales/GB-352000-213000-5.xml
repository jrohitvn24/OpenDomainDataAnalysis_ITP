		<content> The conservation of the forest is a   
 major objective of the{Forestry       
{Commission.}The size{(22,500 acres)}is
 staying the same and they are         
 maintaining the balance between the   
 variety of trees. There are{160 }     
 different species of animals and birds
 but the most destructive is the{deer.}
 These are kept under control by       
 Rangers but poachers also shoot them. 
     The{Wye Valley}is a designated    
{"area of outstanding natural beauty"} 
 and the wooded slopes are of high     
 conservation value. The forestry      
 Commission has close links with the { 
{Royal Society for the Protection of   
{Birds}and the{Gloucester Trust for    
{Nature Conservation.}                 
     Waymarked paths, forest trails    
 campsites, car parks, litter bins     
 educational visits and so on are also 
 provided by the Commission.           </content>
