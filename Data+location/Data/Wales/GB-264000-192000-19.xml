{People born and bred in Swansea are   
{nicknamed 'Swansea Jacks'.            
 The original Swansea Jack was a small 
 terrier dog who became famous in the  
 1930's for rescuing people from the   
 sea.  He saved 27 people and won many 
 awards for this including the dogs    
 'Victoria Cross'.  He appeared with   
 his owner at shows and carnivals      
 raising a lot of money for charity.   
 He died in 1937 at the age of 7 as a  
 result of poisoning.                  
 Swansea people wanted to remember this
 brave dog and subscriptions provided  
 enough money to build a monument to   
 him on the promenade.  His name is    
 also remembered by the public house   
 named after him near Glamorgan Street.
