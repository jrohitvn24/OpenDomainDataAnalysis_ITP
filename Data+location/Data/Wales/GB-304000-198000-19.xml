		<title>19ARNOLD COLE TINSMITH MT.ASH</title>
		<content> Mr Cole is the last remaining tinsmith
 in South Wales.He made many of the    
 items used by the colliers in the mine
 such as food boxes and'tea jacks'.Mr  
 Cole pointed out that some of the     
 things in our school museum had been  
 made by him.He has now retired,and    
 his old tinsmith workshop in Mountain 
 Ash is now a tool shop.Sadly there    
 will be no one to carry on this trade 
 after Mr Cole's days.He said there is 
 very little demand for items made of  
 tin nowadays so nobody could earn     
 enough money to stay in business.     
                                       
 Mr Cole is still asked however to give
 demonstrations of his craft at the    
 National Folk Museum of Wales in      
 St.Ffagan's near Cardiff.He has also  
 had many magazine articles written    
 about him and special features in     
 various newspapers.                   </content>
