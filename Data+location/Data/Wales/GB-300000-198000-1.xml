		<title>01Landscape: Mid Cynon Valley.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The survey area is located in part of 
 the Cynon valley.The valley was eroded
 by ice during the Ice Age and the     
 typical trough-like feature of a      
 glaciated valley is present here.  The
 Cynon flows through this section in a 
 north-west to south-east direction,to 
 illustrate the typical superimposed   
 drainage of the South-Wales Coalfield.
 The Cynon Valley is at its widest     
 point in 0200, here the river meanders
 in a wide flood- plain with some      
 marshland.  The valley sides rise     
 steeply from the valley floor to the  
 mountain summits.  The mountains      
 themselves forming part of a          
 dissected plateau.  The Cynon has one 
 major west bank tributary the         
 Aman,which joins the Cynon at 020014
