		<title>03Mr.Punter's Day</title>
		<content>  Woken by our alarm clock,I get up    
 wash,shave,dress and go downstairs.We 
 have a noisy family breakfast and it's
 off to work (usually on my motorbike) 
 at the{university.                    
     I open up my workshop,switch on   
 the electricity and check the post.I  
 start my main work of repairing our   
 department equipment.Soon it's lunch  
 break-a quiet sit down maybe a trip to
 town to buy something.                
     After lunch I go to the colliery  
 where some of our equipment has       
 failed.When I return I prepare for the
 next day's work-maybe a survey at sea.
 17.00,it's time to go home.After a    
 lively tea I will probably carry on   
 with our home improvements.Tired,I sit
 down to watch the Nine o'Clock News,  
 have supper and then talk to my wife  
 before going to bed,exhausted.
