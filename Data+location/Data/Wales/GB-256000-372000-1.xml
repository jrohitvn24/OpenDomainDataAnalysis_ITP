		<title>01A description of our block.</title>
		<content>     The land within this block is very
 undulating with quite steep slopes in 
 places. To the West lies the coast of 
 Anglesey and the Menai Strait whilst  
 the city of Bangor lies, to a great   
 extent, in the valley of the river    
 Adda.                                 
     The city is divided into several  
 distinct areas both by geography and  
 administration. Upper Bangor lies on  
 top of the westerly ridge whilst      
 Maesgeirchen is hidden behind the area
 known as Bangor Mountain.             
     The area is fairly bilingual      
 (Welsh/English) and has 6 primary and 
 2 secondary schools 1 in each category
 offering education mainly through the 
 medium of Welsh.                      
     Unemployment is high at around    
 15-20%. The University and hospital   
 provide many jobs. A range of services
 are avaliable from lots of small shops</content>
