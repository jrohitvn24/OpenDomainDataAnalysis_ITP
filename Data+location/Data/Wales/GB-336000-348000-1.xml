 The area under study is situated two  
 and three quarter kilometers to the   
 South East of Wrexham town centre.    
 The countryside is generally          
 undulating towards the river Dee lying
 two kilometers to the East.  A large  
 percentage of the area is taken up by 
 the Wrexham Industrial Estate,        
 surrounded by open farmland with      
 small areas of woodland.  The farms   
 are on the whole substantial houses   
 with compact farm buildings and       
 constructed of red brick with slate   
 roofs. The Industrial estate, situated
 5km from the town centre was commenced
 after W.W.2 on the site of an old     
 Royal Ordanance Factory.  the estate  
 has been managed by the Welsh         
 Development Agency since 1976 when it 
 was designated a special development  
 area.                                 </content>
