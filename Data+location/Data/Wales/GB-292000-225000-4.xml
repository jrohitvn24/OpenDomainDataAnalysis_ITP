		<title>04A WALK THROUGH DEFYNNOG</title>
		<content>  If you cross the road to Merthyr by  
 the old Defynnog School (now a pine   
 restoration craftshop) you come to an 
 old narrow lane. The houses are small 
 and close together, just like in the  
 olden days. At the end of this lane,  
 by the disused chapel, is the village 
 stand pipe; now it is used to water   
 the gardens. Another relic is a horse 
 mount and ring set in the wall of one 
 of the nearby cottages.               
  When you go down the next lane you   
 walk on cobble stones until you get to
 the delapidated mill. The mill used to
 grind flour for the whole area, it    
 hasn't been used for years but you can
 still see where the river's course was
 altered to drive the wheel.           
  Right after the old mill is the main 
 road. If you cross by the Tanners Arms
 you can walk to the Parish Church.
