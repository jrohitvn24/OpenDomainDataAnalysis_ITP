		<content> Coal mining has been the chief source 
 of employment in the Tumble area for  
 over 150 years. The village prospered 
 and increased in size with the mining 
 of Anthracite coal when the "Great    
 Mountain" colliery was sunk in 1887.  
 The villages of Tumble and Cwmmawr    
 grew around the mine and the          
 population increased as men from far  
 and wide came to work there. The      
 families needed homes so houses were  
 built to accommodate them.            
                                       
 Coal mining remained the chief source 
 of work in the village until the      
 1950's. In 1947 with the coming of    
 nationalisation the Great Mountain    
 Colliery was coming to the end of its 
 existence and all the men were        
 eventually transferred to work in     
 Cynheidre Colliery when that opened in
 the 50's.                             </content>
