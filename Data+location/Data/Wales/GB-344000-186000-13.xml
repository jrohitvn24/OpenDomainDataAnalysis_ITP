		<content> My name is Melanie and I am eleven    
 years old. I live in{Longfellow Road} 
 in Caldicot with my parents, sister   
 and brother. We have four bedrooms,   
 one kitchen, a dining room and a      
 living room. Downstairs we also have a
 bathroom and toilet.  Our house is    
 heated by Gas and my mother uses a Gas
 cooker for cooking. As well as having 
 a radiator in every room we also have 
 a gas fire in the living room.  There 
 are two sliding glass doors between   
 the living room and the dining room so
 that we can have two separate rooms or
 one long one.  We have a large garden 
 at the back of our house. My father   
 takes care of this but he has given my
 sister and me a small plot for us to  
 grow flowers in.
