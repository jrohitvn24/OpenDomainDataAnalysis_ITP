		<title>04TOURISM IN PENNARD.</title>
		<content>    TOURISTS COME TO PENNARD A LOT     
 BECAUSE OF THE NATURAL SURROUNDINGS   
 AND LITTER FREE BEACHES.              
     TOURISM IN PENNARD IS GOOD FOR    
 THE LOCAL SHOPS BUT SOMETIMES IT IS   
 NOT SO GOOD FOR THE NATURAL           
 SURROUNDINGS.I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE 
 DONT LIKE TOURISTS IF THEY DROP LITTER
 IN THE AREA.                          
    TOURISTS OFTEN COME IN CARAVANS OR 
 TENTS. FARMERS IN THE AREA LET THEM   
 CAMP ON THEIR LAND AND PARK THEIR     
 CARAVANS IF THEY WANT TO.             
    TOURISM ALSO HAS A LOT OF EFFECT ON
 THE BEACHES, SOME DROP LITTER AND SOME
 JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME. THIS MEANS THE 
 BEACHES ARE MOSTLY FULL IN SUMMER.    
    TOURISTS SEEM TO LIKE  THE CLIFFS  
 IN PENNARD,BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO
 HAVE PEOPLE WALKING OR SUN BATHING ON 
 THE ROCKS IN THE SUN.
