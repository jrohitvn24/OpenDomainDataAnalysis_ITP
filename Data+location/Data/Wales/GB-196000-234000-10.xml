		<content> Some of the farm buildingssurrounding 
 the farmyard are very old and were    
 built with stones from the quarry that
 lies on the farm.The loft of one      
 building was the original meeting     
 place of the local baptists before a  
 chapel called GLANDWR(at the          
 waterside)was built nearby in         
 1894.New buildings have been          
 added,including a modern milking shed 
 where the milk is being piped to a    
 tank before being collected daily by  
 milk tanker lorries.                  
 One labourer is employed on the farm  
 and Mr Phillips approves of modern    
 machinery and technology which makes  
 farming easier and more efficient;the 
 first tractor was purchased in 1938
