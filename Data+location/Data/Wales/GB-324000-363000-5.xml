		<content> Of the 348 families returning the     
 questionnaire,334 men and 191 women   
 were at work doing a large variety of 
 jobs.14 men were unemployed and 157 of
 the women were housewives.The 14 men  
 represent about 4% of the men in the  
 sample, which is a surprising rate of 
 unemployment when compared with 15% in
 Clwyd.It is probable that the 72      
 families not returning the            
 questionnaire would have raised the   
 rate considerably.67 men and 82 women 
 work within a mile of home.252 men and
 104 women travel distances varying    
 between a few miles and 40 miles.11   
 men and 5 women are lorry drivers,some
 travelling ll over Britain,3 men work 
 abroad and 1 man travels all over the 
 world as an officer in the Merchant   
 Navy.
