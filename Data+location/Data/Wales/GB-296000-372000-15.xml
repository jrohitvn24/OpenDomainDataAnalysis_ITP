		<content> WATER TREATMENT CENTRE, GLASCOED      
 The Water Treatment Centre came into  
 operation in 1870, was bought by Rhyl 
 U.D.C. in 1893 and in 1965 was        
 transferred to West Denbighshire and  
 West Flintshire Water Board.  The 1973
 Water Act meant that the Board was    
 dissolved and the undertaking was     
 taken over by the Welsh National      
 Development Authority in 1974.  Water 
 is released from reservoirs at Llyn   
 Aled and Aled Isaf on the Denbigh     
 Moors, into the River Aled from which 
 water can only be pumped provided that
 the residual flow exceeds 5 million   
 gallons a day.  To increase any       
 necessary flow in the river, the water
 is then released.  Water from the     
 River Aled and various other resources
 (springs, boreholes etc.) are         
 integrated into the pipelines to the  
 Glascoed Treatment Plant.             </content>
