		<content> The local area is well served by a    
 flourishing{Rugby team}in both of the 
 villages.                             
 The team within the Garnant area do   
 not have their meeting place within   
 the given block but in a public house 
 to the East of the block.  They do    
 however play their home games within  
 the block.                            
 The Rugby Club in Brynamman is an     
{important centre}for local{social     
{groups. }It also houses a squash court
 complex.  Often at weekends local     
 people meet at the Rugby Club in the  
 evenings and the main cultural        
 passtime on such evenings is a sing   
 song with{traditional Welsh songs     
 being sung.                           
 There is also a large gardening       
 society within the area.
