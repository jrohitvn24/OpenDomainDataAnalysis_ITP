		<content>   Country dancing is very interesting.
 We are a part of the Welsh Folk       
 Dancing Society. We practice with     
 music and we have to listen carefully 
 to the beats. Later we have to do the 
 dance to music a few times. We have a 
 teacher called Mrs. Francis who helps 
 us learn the dances properly. When we 
 have learnt all the dances we         
 sometimes go to other schools and     
 dance with them.                      
   Once a year Gwent schools join      
 together in Cwmbran Town Centre to    
 dance. We all wear Welsh costumes.The 
 girls wear a white blouse, black and  
 grey skirt, red becum and a white lace
 pinny. The boys white shirts, black   
 waistcoats, and black trousers.
