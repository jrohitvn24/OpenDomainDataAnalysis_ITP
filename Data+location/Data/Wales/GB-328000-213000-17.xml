		<title>17The Fire Brigade Interview</title>
		<content>We interviewed Mr Ben Woolley the      
Station Officer at Abergavenny Fire    
Station.Mr Woolley told us that he     
started as a fireman in 1956.Mr Woolley
also works at the hospital.We asked him
how his job had changed.He told us that
a new fire station had been built in   
1983 which was in a better position.   
When a 999 call is made the Fire       
Brigade are now informed by a computer.
Details of the fire are sent to the    
fire station by the computer and we    
were shown the printer.The two engines 
can be on their way to a fire about 3  
minutes.There are about 300 call-outs  
a year.In one of the engines we were   
shown the breathing sets used by the   
firemen to enter smokey buildings.     
We very much enjoyed our visit to the  
Fire Station.
