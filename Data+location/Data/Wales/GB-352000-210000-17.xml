		<content> AN{ANNUAL SCHOOL TRIP}TO THE STATELY  
 HOME OF LORD BATH AT LONGLEAT HOUSE   
 ON THE 4TH JULY 1985 BY CLASSES 1 AND 
 2 OF WYESHAM JUNIOR SCHOOL.           
 It was funny when David fell asleep on
{the bus. }He fell off the seat and    
 banged his head but he was still      
 asleep when we got there. Mr.Bagwell  
 had to pickhim up and put him on the  
 seat. While the bus went round the    
{Safari Park}it was very hot because we
 had to have all the windows closed,   
 otherwise the monkeys would get in.   
 One of the monkeys scared me because  
 it shot on the roof of the bus.       
 Afterwards we all went on a boat trip 
 and bought some fish to give to the   
 sealions. We saw many different       
 animals. I took photographs of them.  
 Then we went{off on our own.}We       
 enjoyed getting lost in the maze best 
 of all.                               </content>
