		<content>   The {Central Wales Railway Line}    
 passes through Knighton.It runs from  
 Shrewsbury to Swansea. This line is   
 very important to the inhabitants of  
 Knighton as the mail is carried by    
 rail.The second class mail takes far  
 longer to arrive at its destination   
 now that all mail has to be sent      
 to Shrewsbury to be sorted.Knighton   
 Post Office has thirteen postmen      
 delivering mail on foot and by van to 
 outlying farms.The Post Office is open
 from 9a.m. to 5.30 p.m.each day except
 Wednesdays and Saturdays when it is   
 closed for half a day.                
 We have a Television Transmitter at   
 Knighton.It beams programmes to parts 
 of the area who were having difficulty
 in receiving transmissions from the   
 main transmitter in Ledbury.          
 We also have an automatic Telephone   
 Exchange situated near the town.      </content>
