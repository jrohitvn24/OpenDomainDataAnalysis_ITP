		<title>16LAW AND ORDER IN WELSHPOOL</title>
		<content>{The Welshpool Police Station}is       
 situated on the outskirts of the town,
 near the railway station. There are 35
 officers stationed there together with
 four special constables and one       
 traffic warden. The officers work in  
 shifts from 6am-2pm, 2pm-10pm,and     
 10pm-6am, but rural officers who visit
 local villages work from either       
 5pm-1am or 9am-5pm. The station has   
 three patrol cars but they can borrow 
 more from Newtown if required.        
 The police visit schools teaching road
 safety and also help local horse      
 owners about how to use the roads     
 properly.                             
 The most common crimes in the area are
 petty thefts and motoring offences.   
{The local court in Welshpool}deals    
 with these offences and sits weekly   
 with three judges in attendance.
