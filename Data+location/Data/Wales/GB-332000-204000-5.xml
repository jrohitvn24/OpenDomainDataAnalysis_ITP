		<content>        We start school at 9.00 a.m.   
 and finish at 3.30 p.m.Our lunch break
 is 12.15 p.m. to 1.15 p.m.Our class is
 class 5 and there are 33 pupils aged 9
 years to 11 years.We have a great deal
 of quite hard work especially in maths
 and English.Once a week we have P.E., 
 games and swimming.Occasionally we    
 have football,netball and cricket     
 matches against neighbouring schools. 
       Recently we have been doing a   
 project on {Science}called,{" Science 
{Around Us".}We did a lot of practical 
 work on electricity,water and heat and
 how they affect our lives.            
       At Christmas time we hold our   
 annual concert which includes drama   
 and singing and our parents come to   
 watch us perform.                     
       At the end of the day half of   
 the pupils travel home by mini-bus.
