		<content>   17 farms are located in the block.  
 The land has a sandy subsoil as it is 
 mainly reclaimed. For this reason, wet
 land was expected , but it is so well 
 drained that one farm has installed an
 irrigator to provide more water.      
   Much of the land is managed         
 grassland for pasture and silage used 
 on dairy farms such as Birchen Fields,
 Bumpers Lane and Fir Tree Farms.      
 Thornleigh Park had a dairy herd      
 before the 1967 outbreak of foot and  
 mouth disease. It now has new owners  
 with 190 beef cattle. Barley, wheat,  
 potatoes, oil seed rape, peas and kale
 are also grown; the widest range being
 at Bank Farm.                         
   Finding out about farming is great  
 fun. All of the farming families were 
 very friendly and helpful.
