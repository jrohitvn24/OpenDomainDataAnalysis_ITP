		<title>05Industries In The Area</title>
		<content> The area is considered an employment  
 "black spot."Industry is limited to a 
 few factories with low employment     
 figures.                              
    The two main factories are "Ready  
 Roasted Chickens" and "Pirelli        
 General."The former makes all kinds of
 chickens such as curries,pies and     
 pasties.The latter makes a specialised
 form of cables.                       
    There are goverment sponsered      
 schemes within the area.These         
 concentrate on renevating the homes of
 the elderly or reclaiming over_run    
 canals,churchyards etc.These schemes  
 only run for one year.                
    Two goverment sponsored private    
 buisnesses have started in the        
 locality.One concentrates on computers
 the other sells microwave ovens.      
   Another new buisness is the video   
 hire buisness.Three have opened lately</content>
