		<content> The area is predominantly grassland.  
 In the extreme north-west of the area 
 lies the edge of GLAS-FYNYDD FOREST   
 a major Forestry Comission plantation 
 which has now reached maturity and is 
 being clear-felled. This forest covers
 about 14 square kilometres and extends
 north-westwards to USK RESERVOIR.     
 Both valleys contain a certain amount 
 of deciduous scrub in those places    
 from which sheep are usually excluded.
 The upland tract in the south of the  
 area is predominantly uncultivated    
 grassland like the high ground in     
 other parts of the Brecon Beacons.    
 However this is enclosed farmland,not 
 common grazing, so that there have    
 been important attempts to improve the
 land by draining and application of   
 fertilisers.It is instructive to      
 compare this with FFOREST FACH to the 
 north which is unimproved.            </content>
