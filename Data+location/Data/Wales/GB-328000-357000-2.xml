		<content> To relate back to the dawn of Hope and
 Caergwrle's history we have to take a 
 journey back in time to about 4000 BC 
 when a short roundheaded tribe - the  
 Iberians - are believed to have       
 settled in Britain.  They are thought 
 to have been responsible for one of   
 the area's oldest relics - the Sarn - 
 a stone causeway built to bridge the  
 River Alyn. {(Local history)          
                                       
 The area can also be attributed to    
 being a scene of mass burials, since 4
 sites in Hope could be singled out as 
 prehistoric cemeteries.  The set of 4 
 mounds or 'barrows' could have been   
 'garnished' by food vessels.  One was 
 found in 1823 in an irrigated field by
 workmen and is now a coveted memorial 
 of the area's prehistory.  It is known
 as the Caergwrle Bowl and is kept in  
 the National Museum in Cardiff.       </content>
