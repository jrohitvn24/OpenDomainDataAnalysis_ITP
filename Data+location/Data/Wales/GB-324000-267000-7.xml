		<content> Almost all the houses around here are 
 very old. Most are farm houses or     
 cottages for farm workers which are   
 now lived in by people working in     
 local towns or as holiday homes. The  
 newest houses are in Whitton itself   
 where there are four council houses.  
 There are some new bungalows scattered
 about but these are mostly owned by   
 farmers for their sons or parents.    
 Lots of the old houses have been      
 rebuilt but the holiday cottages are  
 empty for most of the year.Most       
 villages have new houses - but the    
 land at Whitton is mostly owned by the
 Dame Anna Child's Charity and they    
 have not sold land for building on.   
 The people who live in Whitton do not 
 work there, they travel several miles 
 mostly to go to local towns or        
 farms.The biggest houses in Whitton   
 are the Rectory and School House.     </content>
