		<content>    Many children enjoy playing popular
 sports such as football, cricket,     
 netball, tennis or rounders during    
 their playtimes. However, there are   
 other games to be seen on the         
 playground, some traditional, and some
 which have come about as a result of  
 invention or adaptation on the part of
 the children.                         
    Younger children (5-7 year olds)   
 prefer games which follow a specific  
 pattern, such as 'In and Out the Dusty
 Bluebells' or 'I Sent a Letter to My  
 Friend,' whereas many of the games    
 enjoyed by older children (8-11 year  
 olds) involve chases and/or throwing  
 of a ball, such as 'Offground Touch,' 
 'Fox and Hounds' and 'Poison Ball.'   
    A detailed description of two games
 played by the children of Glanaman can
