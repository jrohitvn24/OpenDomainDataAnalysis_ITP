		<title>04Traffic in Mumbles</title>
		<content> Mumbles Rd. is one of the busiest     
 roads in Swansea.They have built a new
 roundabout at the junction of Mumbles 
 Rd. and Newton Rd.They put it there   
 last year because the traffic was so  
 heavy,and there were so many          
 accidents.They have a shortage of car 
 parks as well,so many people wanted to
 build one where the bus terminus      
 is.Mumbles roads are very narrow      
 because they were built for the       
 village,not for the tourists.The road 
 space is reduced when cars park on    
 either side of the road.People often  
 park on the yellow lines.In summer you
 have to get to the beaches at 9.30 or 
 10.00 because the car parks get full  
 very quickly.Off season the hotels,car
 parks and guest houses are empty.
