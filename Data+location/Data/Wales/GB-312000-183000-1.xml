		<title>01Taffs Well/Caerphilly Common</title>
		<content> The locality studied lies sandwiched  
 between Caerphilly to the north, and  
 Cardiff to the south.   The area is   
 known locally as the "Border Ridges"  
 as it overlooks and separates the Vale
 of Glamorgan and the Cardiff Basin in 
 the south, from the massive presence  
 of the S.Wales Coalfield to the north.
 It is essentially an upland region,   
 rising to over 800 feet (270 metres)  
 in places, notably Craig yr Allt (GR  
 134851) and Caerphilly Common (GR     
 154855).  There is, however, a        
 tendency for the northern fringe to be
 at a slightly higher altitude in      
 relation to the southern part.  Only  
 in the extreme west of the area is the
 pattern markedly interrupted by the   
 presence of the River Taff which has  
 etched into this region creating a    
 quite spectacular gorge-like feature.
