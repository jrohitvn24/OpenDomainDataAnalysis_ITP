		<title>11SHOPPING IN ABERAERON</title>
		<content>{May 17th }We carried out a shopping   
 survey of 40 people we found shopping 
 in Aberaeron. We asked 20 locals      
 and 20 tourists.                      
{LOCALS  }  12 of our 20 lived in      
 Aberaeron itself and the others came  
 from nearby villages eg.Llanon,       
 Llanrystud,Llanarth,Ciliau Aeron,     
 Aberarth,Gilfachreda and Cilcennin.   
 They bought their{food}from Aberaeron 
 but travelled over 25 miles or more to
 Swansea, Aberystwyth, Cardigan for    
 more {expensive items.                
 Shopping can be very difficult as we  
 have{little variety of goods          
 especially expensive items, furniture 
 electrical goods,clothes etc.         
{TOURISTS } They came from all over    
 Britain and were mainly interested in 
 buying Welsh souvenirs eg. woollen    
 products,local pottery, slate         
 products, Welsh rock,honey ice cream. </content>
