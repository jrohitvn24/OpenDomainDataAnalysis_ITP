		<content>     On Thursday,July 4th,we went into 
 Carmarthen to do a questionnaire for  
 the Domesday survey.This is some of   
 the information we got,mostly people  
 spend their spare time going to pubs, 
 and no one said they visited the      
 museum. People thought that there are 
 more  facilities for the age group 18-
 30 than other groups for those over   
 50.They thought the age group that had
 least facilities was 11-18. When asked
 what they would like to have in       
 Carmarthen people said a cinema and a 
 theatre. When we asked people for     
 their own ideas about what they would 
 like to see in Carmarthen, the things 
 that were mentioned were :- A proper  
 hall,a wild life park, a zoo and an   
 extension on the community centre.
