         __________                    
 Every year we have an event called    
 BWRLWM BRO.It is similar to the t.v   
 programme "IT'S A KNOCKOUT" where all 
 the surrounding villages select a team
 to compete against each other.The     
 competitions include pillow           
 fighting,tug-of-war(men and women)    
 BMX bike racing,a water marathon and  
 obstacle races.There are categories   
 for all age groups.The winning village
 receives a shield,which it keeps for  
 one year and Â£50 to spend on the      
 community.All the events are aimed to 
 give every age group a chance.The     
 favourite event is the "CELTIC        
 WRESTLING"which is performed within a 
 circle of sawdust.The first to gain   
 two falls wins the contest.
