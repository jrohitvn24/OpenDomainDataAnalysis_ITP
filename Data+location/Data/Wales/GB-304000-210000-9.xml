		<title>09THE RECTORY PONTSTICILL (con</title>
		<content> In 1981 the church put the rectory up 
 for auction,and it was bought  by it,s
 present owners the James's who have   
 undertaken the task  of modernernizing
 the house.They have not yet           
 encountered the ghost of the old women
 who used to own the house,and is said 
 to roam around turning the pictures to
 face the wall.The James family have   
 lived in Pontsticill for the last     
 twelve years,which means that their   
 fifteen year old daughter has had to  
 travel to attend school.She uses the  
 public bus to visit her friends and to
 attend local discos.Much of her       
 leisure time is spent at home practis_
 ing the piano and violin.None of the  
 family find it lonely living in the   
 country because there is so much to do
 to maintain the large garden and keep 
 the old stone house in good repair.
