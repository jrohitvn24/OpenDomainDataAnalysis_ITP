		<title>02WELSH LANGUAGE IN THE VALE</title>
		<content> There are several{Welsh}speaking      
 households in this area. The Ysgol    
 Feithrin (Welsh nursery school) in    
 Wenvoe closed several years ago       
 because of falling attendance. The    
 nearest are in Barry and Cowbridge.   
 One child attends Ysgol Gymraeg in    
 Barry (primary level), but none at    
 present attend secondary education.   
 This area lies within the catchments  
 of Glan Taff, Whitchurch and Coed yr  
 Gorf Cowbridge. There is a chapel     
 (Wallston) in Wenvoe where Welsh      
 services are held once a month. The   
 Welsh society in Barry is supported by
 inhabitants from the area who also    
 attend events given by the Dinas Powys
 Welsh society as well as Welsh        
 language events in Cardiff. A small   
 number of Welsh speakers are also     
 actively involved in the promotion of 
 their language.                       </content>
