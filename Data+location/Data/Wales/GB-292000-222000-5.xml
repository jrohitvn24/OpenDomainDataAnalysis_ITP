 Because the Fan Frynych stations were 
 only occupied for a short time they   
 only provide a rough indication of the
 conditions which are likely to be ex- 
 perienced at these altitudes.  For the
 summit of Fan Frynych, the coldest    
 month appears to have an average temp-
 erature of 1.7 degrees Celsius; the   
 warmest month is about 12 degrees. The
 highest temperature recorded was 24   
 degrees and the lowest was -6.2       
 degrees.The average  difference in    
 temperature between the top of Fan    
 Frynych and a station in Swansea near 
 sea-level was 4.5 degrees C.This means
 that the average spring temperatures  
 on the mountain are experienced 2     
 months later than in Swansea. For     
 example,the Feb. temperatures at      
 sea-level occur in April on the hill  
 tops.                                 </content>
