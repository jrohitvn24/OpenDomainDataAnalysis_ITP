		<title>05HOUSING IN MORFA BYCHAN</title>
		<content> Morfa Bychan is a scattered village   
 consisting of 312 high quality houses.
 Traditional stone-built houses and    
 cottages flank two main roads,both of 
 which lead to the beach.Several       
 unadopted roads branch off these      
 roads.Before 1960 lack of mains       
 drainage meant few other properties   
 were built.To allow further housing,  
 developers built treatment plants     
 serving five private estates,and in   
 1984 a sewage scheme was started to   
 serve the whole village.New buildings 
 are constructed of brick and breeze   
 block and,in accordance with planning 
 regulations,are rendered with cement  
 which is faced or colour-washed.The   
 new houses are roofed with local slate
 except for 5 timber houses which have 
 iron roofs.
