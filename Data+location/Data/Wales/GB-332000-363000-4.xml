		<content> have a bigger shopping centre, as the 
 present one is not in the centre of   
 Broughton.The majority of the         
 population live to the north east of  
 the shopping area . There is also a   
 hospital at Broughton which provides  
 facilities for mentally handicapped   
 children. This facility is not going  
 to be extended for at least ten years.
 The community is also served by a     
 doctor who is located on the main     
 road.There are also two schools, an   
 infants school which has two hunderd  
 and fifty pupils and a junior school  
 which has three hundred and twenty    
 pupils.On the whole Broughton has the 
 advantages of being accessible, with  
 enough new housing to meet the        
 increase in poulation.However there   
 are few opportunities for employment. 
 At the present moment there are enough
 facillities for the population.       </content>
