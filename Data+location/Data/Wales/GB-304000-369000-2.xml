		<title>02POLICE</title>
		<content> In Trefnant a policeman was           
 interviewed named William Howie who   
 was the only policeman in the village.
 The crime rate in the village is very 
 low.                                  
 In an average nights work firstly it  
 consists of collecting mail from      
 Denbigh, then he makes enquiries until
 9:oo pm. then he will take a break of 
 about 45 minutes.  Finally if he is   
 not called out he will check property,
 cars and local pubs.William Howie     
 enjoys being a policeman in the       
 village.  He considers himself lucky  
 to work in a small village with a low 
 crime rate rather than in a city with 
 a higher crime rate.
