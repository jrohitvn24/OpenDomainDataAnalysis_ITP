		<title>17HOW BRYNFORD HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content> The lady we interviewed has been      
 in                                    
 Brynford nearly 83 years. She thought 
 Brynford has changed a lot. Brynford  
 looked very poor during the war. She  
 likes Brynford better now. She went to
 Brynford school. She thought Brynford 
 wasn't as cosy after the Avenue was   
 built.When they were young they had to
 make their own games.She wants the    
 new road to be convenient for her. She
 would like the sheep to be away       
 because sheep-muck often gets on her  
 carpet.                               
   At first Brynford was a nice, small 
 village where all the people new each 
 other but the new houses have spoilt  
 it and people don't know each other   
 very well.There's a lot of vandalism  
 in the village;windows being smashed  
 and fires being lit on the mountain.  
 So Brynford has changed a lot.        </content>
