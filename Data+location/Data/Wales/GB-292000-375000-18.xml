		<content> There is lack of employment in the    
 town, however, Abergele is known as   
 the Motor Car Centre of North Wales,  
 with at least 8 garages and only two  
 of them sell petrol, the remainder    
 dealing in the sales of motor cars.   
 Slaters of Abergele employ 50         
 mechanics 20 staff, 25 salesmen.      
 There is also the Tanyard and a very  
 small industrial estate in Peel Street
 precision engineering, welders and two
 depots, largest being coca cola.      
                                       
 However, the area is rural and farming
 is predominant with a Beast Market    
 held every Monday and two Wednesdays  
 in every month.  The town is literally
 surrounded by caravan sites and the   
 population quadruples during the      
 summer months giving employment to    
 many towns people.
