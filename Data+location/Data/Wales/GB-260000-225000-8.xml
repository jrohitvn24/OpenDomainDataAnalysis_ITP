{Primary}   -The former  Welsh language
 based  Independent  primary  school in
 Salem,under the headship of Mr. George
 Jenkins  for some 25 yrs,  was finally
 closed in 1983.  Its closure, strongly
 opposed by villagers,   means that all
 the children aged  3 to 11yrs  have to
 be   transported  either  to Llandeilo
 English Primary  school or Ysgol Teilo
 Sant,  a bilingual school.  60% of the
 children travelling on the  bus attend
 the English school.                   
{Secondary} -11-18yr olds travel either
 to Tregyb (English medium,  Llandeilo)
