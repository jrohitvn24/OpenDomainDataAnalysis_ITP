		<title>19CHURCHES_COSHESTON/PEMBROKE</title>
		<content> Cosheston is one of the oldest        
 parishes recorded. There are remains  
 of an old monk's cell nearby and there
 is the socket from and old celtic     
 preaching cross in the churchyard.    
    St Michael's Church was rebuilt in 
 1881. There was a spire on the tower, 
 but in 1980 it was pulled down because
 it was unsafe. Also in Cosheston is a 
 Evangelical Mission Hall.             
    At Lower Nash there is another     
 Church in Wales building, dedicated to
 the Virgin Mary.                      
    Churchgoers in North Pembroke      
 attend the chapels and churches in    
 Pembroke &amp; Pembroke Dock. Not as many 
 people go to church now as in the past
 but there are still many chapels and  
 churches in the town. Especially      
 popular are the Non_ conformist       
 chapels, the Catholic churches &amp; the  
 Church in Wales churches.             </content>
