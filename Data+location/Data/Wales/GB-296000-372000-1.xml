		<content> The area is situated south of the     
 A.55 and it is also south of the      
 village of St.George and south west of
 the village of Bodelwyddan.           
 The area has no village within its    
 boundary.   It is mainly agricultural 
 land and although there is a park land
 marked on the map, this land is also  
 used for farming.                     
 There is the river Elwy that flows    
 from west to east at the southern     
 extremity of the area.                
 The area is of lowland but has several
 hills, but these do not rise to any   
 significant height and the overall    
 impression is that of undulation.   To
 view the area as a whole it would be  
 necessary to climb to the top of      
 MOELFRE ISAF 1086'which is outside the
 perimeter of the given area in a      
 westerly direction.
