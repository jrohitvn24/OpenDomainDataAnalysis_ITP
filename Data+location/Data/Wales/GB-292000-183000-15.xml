		<content>  Mynydd-y-Gaer is dotted with Hill    
 farms, many being hundreds of uears   
 old.                                  
  Cefn Carfan Uchaf is one such farm   
 and covers 45 acres. Mr.Griffiths, the
 farmer, has 40 cows and about 100     
 sheep. He grows no crops but 15 acres 
 is used for growing hay. The cows     
 graze the remainder whilst the sheep  
 graze the mountain land to the north. 
  Mr. Griffiths has been a farmer all  
 his life and would not consider any   
 other sort of work. He seldom has a   
 holiday because his animals always    
 need his attention.                   
  He is concerned about conservation   
 and recently he has planted over 500  
 young trees on a section of his land. 
  He hopes that his sons will continue 
 to farm the land after him.
