		<content> THE ROADS ARE NARROW WITH HEDGEROWS   
 ON EACH SIDE. BEYOND THE HEDGEROWS ARE
 FIELDS OF CORN BELONGING TO THE       
 FARMER. ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD ARE  
 SCATTERED OAK AND ASH TREES WHICH ARE 
 MAINLY COVERED WITH IVY. IN THE       
 HEDGEROWS GREW NETTLES, BRAMBLES,     
 DIFFERENT GRASSES AND WILD FLOWERS.   
 UNDERNEATH ALL THIS THERE IS A        
 DRAINAGE DITCH. TO THE SOUTH WE COULD 
 SEE WAT'S DYKE. ON THE WAY TO OLD     
 SONTLEY WE WALKED PAST A DAIRY FARM.  
 AROUND THE FIELDS THERE IS AN ELECTRIC
 FENCE TO STOP THE COWS GETTING OUT. ON
 THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD THERE  
 IS A 17TH CENTURY HOUSE WITH WELL     
 KEPT GARDENS. ON THE WAY BACK MEN WERE
 MAKING SILAGE.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
