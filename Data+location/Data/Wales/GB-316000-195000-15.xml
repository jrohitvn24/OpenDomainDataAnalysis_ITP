		<title>15The Tourist Industry.</title>
		<content>      Tourism has become of great      
 importance in our area due to the     
 decline of heavy industry. Many       
 industrial sites and tips have been   
 flattened out and grassed to restore  
 much of the area's former beauty. To  
 attract tourists to our area we have  
 golf courses, swmming baths and       
 numerous leisure centres. You can fish
 locally and there is pony trekking and
 walking near by. Special events in our
 area consist of sheepdog trials, hot  
 air balloon fair, a country fair,     
 ploughing and hedging competitions and
 a weekly market at Blackwood. Tourists
 will find numerous eating places which
 vary from hotels to pubs. The Plas    
 Inn, for example, is a 16th century   
 farm house which offers food and      
 refreshment to visitors. Our area     
 makes an ideal centre for touring to  
 many historical places of interest.   </content>
