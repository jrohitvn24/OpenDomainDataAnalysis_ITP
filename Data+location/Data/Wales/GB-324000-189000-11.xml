		<content> Some of the games we play today are   
 hockey,rounders,tennis,netball and    
 badminton.To play hockey you need a   
 curved stick and a ball,the idea of   
 the game is that you hit the ball     
 towards the goals.                    
    To play netball you need seven     
 players on each side,and a ball.You   
 cannot move while the ball is in your 
 hands.To score a point,you have to    
 throw the ball through the ring at the
 top of pole.                          
    To play rounders you need a bat and
 a ball and four poles which are called
 bases to play the game.When you hit   
 the ball you must run around all the  
 bases to a rounder.The fielders must  
 try to catch you out.                 
    Tennis is played wereby two to four
 people continue to hit a ball,with a  
 tennis racket,back and forward the    
 net.                                  </content>
