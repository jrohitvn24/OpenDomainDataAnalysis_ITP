 COMMENTS*                             
 These are all rather small farms of   
 approx. 100 acres and are used for    
 sheep-grazing mainly.  Some have very 
 rough mountain pasture which means a  
 good deal of hard work shepherding    
 during seasons.  Weather generally is 
 mild with quite a lot of rin in winter
 months.  Some summers (l984) are      
 unusally dry creating problems of     
 adequate pasture.  Some, like TECWYN  
 WILLIMS,Frondirion are part-time      
 farmers.              >>>END          </content>
