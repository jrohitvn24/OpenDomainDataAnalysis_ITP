 Our{Poetry}Evening-by Nick Evans      
    The chairs were set out in the     
 hall.                                 
 We were all nervous while practising  
 in the J4 area.                       
  The important guests started to      
 arrive and then our parents arrived.  
  We lined up in the staff room and    
 walked to our places.                 
  Mr.Stephen{Knight}read some of his   
 poems first then it was up to us.     
  We read some poems then it was the   
 turn of the choir.The{choir}came out  
 and sang their songs.                 
  At the end of the evening everyone   
 clapped and clapped.We all took home  
 a copy of the anthology,it had a      
 lovely green cover and was full of our
 very own poems and drawings.          
  It was hard work but we were glad we 
 took part in an entertaining evening. </content>
