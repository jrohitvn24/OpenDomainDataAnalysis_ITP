		<content> Some of the families consist of       
 several generations under one roof or 
 very close by. Older people, if they  
 don't live with their children, often 
 retire to a bungalow in Rhayeder.     
 Conversely someof the people that have
 moved into the area are retired       
 couples.                              
    The local shop is 3 miles away, but
 a mobile shop tours the farms once a  
 week, especially welcome during the   
 winter months, but bulk buying tends  
 to be done at the supermarkets of the 
 surrounding towns.                    
    The older families still have a    
 'best' parlour only used on special   
 occasions, and a large farm kitchen   
 which is used for most everyday       
 activities. Nearly everyone has a     
 freezer to store large amounts of food
 for the winter or busy spells on the  
 farm.                                 </content>
