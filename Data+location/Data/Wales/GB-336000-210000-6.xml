 The Stable Blocks were originally     
 stables when the school was owned by  
 the Herberts. Over the past 20 years  
 they have been used as classrooms. The
 stables are in a rectangular form     
 with an arched entrance. Converted    
 classrooms include a junior science   
 lab, music room and an art room.      
 Linked to the Stable block is a sports
 hall. Other activities taking place   
 around the stable block include       
 woodwork, shooting (on a range) and   
 judo takes place in the gymnasium.
