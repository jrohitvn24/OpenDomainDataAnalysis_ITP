		<content> The houses and barns built of local   
 stone blend into the landscape. At    
 Stowe they nestle into the hillside   
 while the others all have their       
 shelter belt of trees. A stream runs  
 through the old barn at Stowe, but the
 newer barns and cattle sheds are of   
 concrete blocks, with corrugated iron 
 roofs. The Stud Farm has a steel silo 
 with fibreglass roof for corn storage.
 The church at Stowe is basically 13th 
 century but little remains visible    
 after 19th century 'restoration' when 
 new windows were inserted into the    
 thick stone walls, and the timber and 
 stone porch and pyramidal wooden      
 clapboard bell turret were added. The 
 interior has a fine 17th century black
 and white timber roof and an unusual  
 Italian 'Art Nouveau' reredos in      
 mosaic panels of coloured stone,      
 mother of pearl and copper.           </content>
