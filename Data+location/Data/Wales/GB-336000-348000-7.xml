		<content>    With the development of post-war   
 light industry, buildings erected in  
 1940 as part of the Royal Ordnance    
 Factory were adapted for housing. The 
 Board of Trade built 100 houses for   
 rent in 1947 to attract key workers at
 a time of manpower shortage. In the   
 1960's they were bought by Wrexham    
 Rural District Council. They are of   
 traditional brick with tiled rooves,  
 cement rendered walls and colour      
 washed. There are detached,           
 four-bedroomed houses and smaller ones
 grouped together in blocks. The       
 houses, with their small paned metal  
 window frames, are very well          
 maintained with attractive flower beds
 and well-cut open grass areas. One    
 part is called "Pilgrim's Way" - a    
 reference to a nearby pilgrim's grave 
 on an old route of the Middle Ages.
