		<content> BIRDS IN THE TALYBONT AREA            
 Herons have been seen fishing along   
 the rivers Leri and Ceulan.           
 Woodpigeons,Blue tits,Great tits and  
 Pied Flycatchers nest regularly round 
 the village.                          
     Jackdaws and House sparrows are   
 very common as well as Robins which   
 are here all the year round.          
    In summer if you keep your eyes    
 open you can sometimes see Red Kites  
 which are very rare,the other birds of
 prey found in the area are the        
 Buzzard,Kestrel and sometimes         
 Sparrowhawks are seen.Greenfinches,   
 Chaffinches and Blackbirds are common 
 in the area.                          
     In winter we get plenty of        
 Redwings,Fieldfares,gulls and         
 sometimes even Siskins and Bramblings.
 Near Talybont is a bog called Cors    
 Fochno which is rich in bird life.    </content>
