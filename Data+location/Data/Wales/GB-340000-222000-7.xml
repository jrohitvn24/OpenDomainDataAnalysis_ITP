 For a thousand years or more the      
 people of the{Grosmont}area have been 
 involved in farming.On the grassy hill
 sides sheep predominate but the more  
 fertile,flatter river valley is most  
 suitable for cattle rearing and crops.
 This pattern of agriculture was formed
 quite early,because we know that in   
 the thirteenth century,the{King}of    
{England}was making profits from the   
 sale of wheat,barley and oats as well 
 as fleeces,while the{Abbot}of{Dore    
{Abbey}was raising sheep on the hills, 
 the wool from which probably supplied 
 the local cloth industry.Today,the    
 cloth industry has gone but the local 
 farmers still raise sheep and cattle  
 and grow cereals but the profits no   
 longer go to the{Crown}or the{Church  
 and the methods they use are more up  
 to date.                              </content>
