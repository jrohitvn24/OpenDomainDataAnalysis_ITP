		<title>15LLANSTEFFAN: PUBLIC SERVICES</title>
		<content> Llanybri and Llansteffan are          
 administered by Dyfed County Council, 
 Carmarthen District Council, and the  
 local Community Council for which we  
 are divided into 2 wards. We are in   
 Carmarthen parliamentary constituency.
 A mobile policeman from Carmathen     
 visits once a week. There is little   
 crime: salmon poaching was the sole   
 recent crime. But there is quite a lot
 of minor mischief such as vandalism by
 children. Police and coastguards are  
 readily available in emergencies. Fire
 Service and ambulances also have to be
 called from Carmarthen. In a recent   
 drowning tragedy, RAF rescue          
 helicopters from Brawdy saved a life. 
 Most people have telephones, but a    
 substantial minority, especially      
 pensioners, do not. There are adequate
 public call boxes - so far, but       
 perhaps for not much longer.          </content>
