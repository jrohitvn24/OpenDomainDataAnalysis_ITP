		<content>  A popular activity at the week-end is
 to go on a visit to a local attraction
  Some people enjoy visiting{museums   
 such as the Nelson Museum in Monmouth,
 Chepstow Museum, or Wolvesnewton Folk 
 Museum.  The new Roman Museum in      
 Caerleon should be interesting too.   
  There are lots of{castles}in this    
 part of Wales: Raglan, Caldicot and   
 Chepstow are interesting ruins whilst 
 Penhow Castle is a super renovation.  
{ Wildlife parks}are popular for day   
 trips because you can get close to the
 animals in their natural surroundings.
 The lions at Longleat and the wildfowl
 at Slimbridge provide interesting     
 visits.                               
  Usually families go in their cars and
 take a picnic meal to eat on their day
 trip, but sometimes large groups of   
 people will go together on a coach.
