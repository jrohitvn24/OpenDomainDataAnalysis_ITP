		<content> North Gwynedds' main paper is the     
{North Wales Weekly News},which has its
 head office and works situated on the 
 edge of the Conwy River. Due to the   
 expansion of the company this is the  
 second site,originally it was sited on
 the quay at Conwy,this is now a       
 bandstand.With further expansion over 
 the past five years (1980-85),it has  
 incorporated other regional newspapers
 such as the{Caernarvon and Denbigh    
{Herald.}Originally the paper was      
 printed with line o'type machines     
 taking a long time.With the need for  
 modernisation it is now assembled and 
 printed with the aid of computers and 
 other high-technology machines.Further
 expansion of the site is visualized   
 for the future due to the prosperity  
 and popularity of the paper.
