		<content> THE FIRST SCHOOL FOR THE CHILDREN OF  
 MARCHWIEL WAS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE AND 
 HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE CHURCH IN WALES.
 AS THE VILLAGE GREW A LARGER SCHOOL   
 WAS BUILT BY THE CHURCH, NEARLY       
 OPPOSITE THE PARISH CHURCH, WITH A    
 HOUSE FOR THE HEADMASTER ADDED TEN    
 YEARS LATER. IN 1974, HOWEVER, THE    
 PRESENT OPEN PLAN PRIMARY SCHOOL      
 SITUATED AT THE RIDGEWAY WAS COMPLETED
 THE OLD BUILDING BEING SOLD TO THE    
 LOCAL FURNISHING FIRM, SCOTTS. AS A   
 RESULT OF A SURVEY OF PARENTS CARRIED 
 OUT BY THE AUTHORITY IT WAS DECIDED   
 THAT THE NEW SCHOOL SHOULD BE RUN     
 INDEPENDENTLY OF THE CHURCH. THE      
 SCHOOL MANAGERS DECIDED TO RETAIN THE 
 150 YEAR OLD LINK WITH THE CHURCH BY  
 NAMING THE NEW SCHOOL AFTER ST DEINIOL
 TO WHOM THE CHURCH IS DEDICATED.      
 HENCE, DEINIOL COUNTY PRIMARY SCHOOL.
