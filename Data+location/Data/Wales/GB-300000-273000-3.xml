		<title>03Employment in Bwlchysarnau</title>
		<content>  The major form of employment is      
 farming with 12 of the households in  
 the area being family farms or        
 associated dwellings. Only 1 person is
 actually employed as a farmworker,    
 most farms making do with family help.
 Three people are self employed, a     
 builder, an agricultural contractor   
 and a garage owner, who also employs a
 mechanic / bus driver.                
    One person works in the Forestry   
 Commission, six housholds consist of  
 retired persons and the remainder     
 travel to employment in the           
 surrounding towns ranging from factory
 work to Local Authority employment.   
 The distance travelled each day is a  
 problem in finding a job as are the   
 weather conditions in winter. At the  
 moment there is no unemployment       
 problem, although several of the      
 schoolleavers are on YTS schemes.     </content>
