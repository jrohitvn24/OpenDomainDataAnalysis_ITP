		<content>  Litchard Primary School opened in    
 February 1953,but in February 1969 it 
 split into infant and junior schools, 
 taking children from four to six and  
 seven to eleven years of age.The      
 infants has 206 children and the      
 juniors 275.                          
  Ten years ago the Nature reserve was 
 started and completed in 1980,when it 
 won a Prince of Wales award.          
  In 1983 the School won one of the    
 first ever Schools'Curriculum Awards. 
 Thus becoming the only school in      
 Mid-Glamorgan to gain one.            
  The children study subjects including
 Maths,English,Welsh,Art,History,R.E., 
 Geography,Science,Environmental       
 Studies,Health,P.E.,Games and Folk    
 Dancing.Swimming is also on the Time  
 Table,for the school has its own      
 swimming pool,due to the efforts of   
 its very active P.T.A.                </content>
