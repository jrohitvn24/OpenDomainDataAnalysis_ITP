		<title>02NATURE RESERVE AT LAVERNOCK</title>
		<content>                                       
 The nature reserve at Lavernock is a  
 14 acre area of scrubland             
 extending along the cliff top from    
 Lavernock Point (from where Marconi   
 sent his first radio message across   
 water) to St.Mary's Well Bay.         
   The reserve is designated a{Site of 
{Special Scientific Interest.}This is  
 because of the great variety and      
 comparative rarity of some of the     
 plants which grow there. These wild   
 plants attract 20 species of          
 butterflies to the reserve.           
   In Britain there are 60 species of  
 breeding butterflies. Only 8 species  
 are not declining in numbers. This is 
 because in most areas the profusion of
 wild plants has gone as land is       
 ploughed and hedges and woodland are  
 cleared for the cultivation of crops.
