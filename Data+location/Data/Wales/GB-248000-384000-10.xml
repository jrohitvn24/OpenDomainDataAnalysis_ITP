 A member of the diving team came to   
 school to discuss The Royal Charter.  
 We saw some underwater slides of their
 work and some artefacts. Some         
 artefacts were encrusted in marine    
 life. They had to be kept in water or 
 they would fall apart.                
    They are convinced that they will  
 find gold bars, Australian &amp; British  
 sovereigns &amp; the ship's engine. The   
 engine is very valuable and was built 
 in Greenwich.They hope to find several
 cannons and valuable wine like that   
 sold at Sotheby's for Â£250,000.       
     They have no intention of bringing
 up the ship because of the expense.   
 The R.Ch did not break up in the storm
 as books claim.It was broken up during
 later salvaging attempts.             
      David Mathews and Carey Lambert.
