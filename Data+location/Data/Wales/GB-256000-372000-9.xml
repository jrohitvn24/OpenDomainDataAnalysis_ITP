 Our local paper, published weekly, is 
 called The Chronicle. The front page  
 of the 6 June, 1985 issue told us that
 a mini Science Park was planned for   
 the downtown area of the city. Gwynedd
 County Council, Arfon Borough Council 
 and UCNW Bangor had agreed between    
 them to build a 50,000 square foot    
 building next to the Science Library, 
 Deiniol Road for this purpose. It is  
 hoped that some much needed new jobs  
 will be created.                      
        Other stories included one     
 about four pupils from Friars Upper   
 School who were given the opportunity 
 of being the main characters in a film
 being made to publicise the needs of  
 Women's Aid.                          
        The youngest winner at this    
 years's Urdd National Eisteddfod was a
 four year old Bangor girl.            </content>
