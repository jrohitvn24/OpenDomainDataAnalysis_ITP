		<content> About two thirds of the families do   
 not go to the local libraries but most
 have newspapers.About half have a     
 daily paper including everything from 
 the Sun to the Observer,Guardian and  
 Times.Far more popular are            
 agricultural and local papers - Mid   
 Wales Journal, Hereford Times, Farmers
 Weekly, and Shropshire Star are taken 
 in some sort of combination by almost 
 all the families in this school.      
                                       
 Television is very popular despite the
 fact that a significant proportion    
 (about 30%) get very bad reception and
 cannot receive, in many cases, all    
 four channels.Despite being in Wales  
 we cannot get Welsh tv services.      
 Listening to the radio is not popular.
