		<content> The{Delyn Enterprise Zones}in Flint   
 are pieces of land in the Borough of  
 Delyn used for industrial development.
 It is trying to provide much needed   
 employment in the area. As there are  
 disadvantages in relying on one big   
 factory in the area, the Council are  
 trying to concentrate on smaller      
 factories. The Enterprise Zone is     
 ideally situated for industry, as     
 there are very good{road links.}      
{Shipping}is also easy, as there is    
 Mostyn and the large Liverpool Dock.  
 With three{airports}nearby, Hawarden, 
 Speke and Manchester, transport by air
 is convenient. People should come to  
 Delyn because of the Enterprise Zone  
 and because of the{historical}places  
 such as Flint castle and the seaside  
 resorts and{leisure}activities.       
 All in all, Delyn is an attractive    
 area of North Wales.                  </content>
