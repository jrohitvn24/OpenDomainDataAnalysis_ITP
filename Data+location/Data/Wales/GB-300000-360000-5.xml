		<content>    The activities of the Welsh        
 Methodist Capel Waen show the Welsh   
 lifestyle of the area. The membership 
 is 90 and half will attend either one 
 of the Welsh services or the Sunday   
 School. The Sunday School has classes 
 for all ages up to adults, with       
 separate groups for men and women. An 
 encouraging sign is the group of 14   
 teenagers and young people.           
    The minister stresses the value of 
 the family service which has sections 
 on one theme to suit all ages in the  
 congregation.                         
    Good support comes for the midweek 
 religious meeting.The young group,    
 called{trwro}was originally a mission 
 group concerned with work in India,   
 its emblem is a dove. Older groups    
 have Bible classes or discussions on  
 video programmes.
