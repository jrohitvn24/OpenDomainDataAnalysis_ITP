		<content> archeologist.they say that in the     
 Second World War they used the caves  
 to store ammunition and old paintings 
 from old Gallerys.                    
 She told us about the White Marble    
 Church in St. Asaph. The story goes   
 that a man met his wife on that spot, 
 when her coach broke down so he built 
 a church. The blank graves in the     
 churchyard are Canadians from Kimnel  
 Camp next door, some say they mutinied
 and some say they died of the 'flu. At
 that Point her daughter came in and   
 told us what there is for the young   
 ones to do, the main thing seems to be
 horseriding, there is a Youht Club on 
 a Wednesday night and between 6 and 20
 people go to that.If she wants to go  
 to a disco she has to be driven to    
 St.Asaph. Mrs.Day thinks it is very   
 important to drive in the area.
