		<title>11Gospel Hall/Calfaria Chapel</title>
		<content> The Gospel Hall congregation          
 originated in 1919 when a group of 12 
 members erected a tent for worship.   
 The Evangelists at this time were a   
 Mr. Benard and a Mr. McCoulough. Later
 in 1919 the members erected an army   
 hut for their meetings. In 1926 local 
 land owner Mrs. Blandy Jenkins        
 provided a plot near the Llanharan    
 Colliery to build the permanent hall  
 which was to hold 150 people. The hall
 was opened in 1927. Today there is    
 still an active congregation at the   
 Gospel.                               
    Calfaria chapel had its beginnings 
 during the 1926 General Strike when a 
 stage was erected to provide          
 entertainment for striking miners. It 
 was also used by Welsh Baptists. The  
 chapel was built in January 1929 and  
 forced to close in 1968, due to a lack
 of Welsh-speaking attenders.          </content>
