		<content>  In the given area it is true to say  
 that it is staunch "Labour".  Apart   
 from Glenboi (03.99) the area, under  
 local boundaries is known as Aberaman 
 South; and under county boundaries the
 area is known as Aberaman.  The       
 Aberaman south_ward has three out of  
 three local councillors, (all labour);
 Mr. Ned McCue, Mr. William Pearson,   
 and Mr. Peter Perry.  The County ward 
 of Aberaman returns one councillor    
 (also Labour), Mr. Robert Reed J.P.   
 During the 1960's the Welsh           
 Nationalist Party, "Plaid Cymru" was  
 strong in this area but never gained a
 councillor.                           
      Not every part of the area is    
 Labour though, one part, Park View    
 Terrace (023.003), Abercwmboi is known
 as "Little Moscow".  One can only ask 
 "Where's the Kremlin?".
