		<content>    We are situated within easy reach  
 of a variety of contrasting ecological
 habitats. Within the area itself is   
 the rocky shore, cliff face, sea,     
 upper grassland areas and bog, Cors   
 Fochno. Within easy reach are the     
 Ynyslas sand dunes, Dyfi estuary and  
 salt marsh.                           
    {Cors Fochno} is the largest and   
 most important sea level bog of its   
 kind in Europe.About 12,000 years ago,
 it was a lake with a reed bed which   
 grew into a forest. A change in sea   
 level swamped the forest and the bog  
 was formed.                           
    The bog has a collection of rare   
 plants and animals, including a rare  
 species of marsh orchid, visits from  
 the Greenland white fronted geese, the
 rosy marsh moth which was rediscovered
 there in 1965 and a rare harvest mouse
 discovered a few years ago.           </content>
