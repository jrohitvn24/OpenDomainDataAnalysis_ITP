		<title>07Rock quarrying Llanddulas</title>
		<content> The Quarry was first called Kneeshaw  
 Lupton.It was taken over by two       
 Scottish brothers called Robinson.    
 After them came Powell Dyffryn. The   
 present owners of the Quarry are Amey 
 Roadstone Corporation.                
           When blasting, dynamite is  
 put in a drilled hole,which is then   
 ignited electrically.When the blast   
 takes place,a hooter is sounded to    
 warn people of danger.                
           The limestone is transported
 through a tunnel to a crusher, at     
 20,000 tons a week.                   
           This year the Quarry opened 
 a part of the Quarry as a tip. This is
 unique, as this is the first in Wales,
 and it incorporates three Borough     
 Councils.It is covered each day with  
 soil,so that nobody would know that a 
 tip was there.Many people disapproved 
 of siting the tip so near the village.</content>
