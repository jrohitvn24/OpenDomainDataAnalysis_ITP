		<title>15Family Possesions</title>
		<content> Information about family possesions   
 compiled from our questionaire.Of the 
 80 houses we interviewed only 20 had  
 videos.Five people out of the lot had 
 black and white T.V's others had      
 colours.Forty five families had a car,
 seven had caravans or tents and 14 had
 computers.Every family with a computer
 had children.Most of the families had 
 pets whether they had children or not.
 Only thirteen families didn't have a  
 pet.Most people had one pet only.Few  
 families had hamsters,ferrets,rabbits 
 or budgies.More people had dogs or    
 cats than anything else.Almost all the
 children had a bike.
