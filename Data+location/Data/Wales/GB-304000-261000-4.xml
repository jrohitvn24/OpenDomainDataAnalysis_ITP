 stands in the centre of the little    
 village of Llanyre.The vicar is Canon 
 Winford Rees who lives in the         
 vicarage.Every Sunday there is a      
 service usually Holy Communion.We have
 five servers and one other man helping
 the vicar.We have Sunday school every 
 Sunday afternoon at half past two.We  
 also have a choir which meet every    
 Monday night for choir practice.      
   Every year we have the annual       
 Harvest Supper in the Church Hall.    
 Before the supper we have a service of
 Holy Communion.The Harvest Supper is a
 happy event and people from lots of   
 other parishes join us.               
   Last year it was the vicar's        
 anniversary of being with the church  
 for 25 years.
