		<content> Because of the importance of CRAY     
 RESERVOIR, the dam of which lies      
 within this area,a series of rainfall 
 measurements have been maintained     
 continuously since the first decade   
 of the century. These are both        
 reliable and of long duration.Annual  
 rainfall totals decrease from 2150    
 millimetres near the head of the      
 reservoir to 1959 mm  beside the dam. 
 Associated with these records are the 
 rain gauge measurements formerly made 
 at Crai Post Office at the height of  
 283 metres. Here the total is 1803 mm 
 indicating the rapid decrease in the  
 amount of rainfall in the rain shadow 
 north of the mountains.               
 As elsewhere in this part of Wales the
 wettest months are usually November   
 and December.
