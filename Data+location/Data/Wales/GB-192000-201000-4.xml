		<title>04Wallaston Farm Part 1</title>
		<content> Wallaston is a 220 acre dairy farm.It 
 has 152 milking cows, 100 sheep, 60   
 cattle and 2 horses.The horses are    
 show horses and used for hunting.Twice
 a day all 152 fresian cows are milked 
 in a modern milking parlour,taking    
 about two and a half hours,by just one
 cowman.When the farmers wife came to  
 the farm about 15 years ago only 30   
 cows were milked,taking the same time 
 as today.The milk from cow to tanker  
 does not come into contact with the   
 air as it travels through pipes to the
 cooled tank and  pumped into a tanker 
 which comes round the farms of the    
 area each day and transports the milk 
 to the Milk Marketing Board depot at  
 Whitland.All kinds of machinery such  
 as tractors,trailers,balers,muck      
 spreaders and mowing machines to      
 produce food for the cows such as     
 silage and corn,are to be seen.       </content>
