		<content> Some ways of improving the area were  
 suggested.One of the main ones being  
 the provision of a playground for     
 children. It is also felt that more   
 could be done for the employment of   
 young people so that they do not have 
 to travel away from the area. Many    
 people suggested that the bus service 
 could be much more efficient. Traffic 
 on the narrow country lanes can be    
 quite heavy and many would like a     
 speed  restriction put on all         
 vehicles.The surface of the roads     
 caused some concern and some dangerous
 corners needed widening. Occasionally 
 low flying aircraft disturb the peace 
 and frighten people and animals,and   
 these should be stopped.              
    Others felt that the preservation  
 of the Welsh way of life and culture  
 was vital and people moving into the  
 area should be made aware of this.    </content>
