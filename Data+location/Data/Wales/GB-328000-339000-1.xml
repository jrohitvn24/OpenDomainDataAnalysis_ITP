		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> THIS IS A VERY RURAL AREA. THERE ARE  
 TWO VILLAGES, TWO HAMLETS, ONE MODERN 
 HOUSING ESTATE ON THE EDGE OF A SMALL 
 TOWN AND A LOT OF SPACED OUT COTTAGES 
 AND FARMS. MOST OF THE LAND IS        
 AGRICULTURAL, INTENSIVELY MANAGED     
 GRASSLAND USED FOR COWS AND SHEEP. IN 
 THE SUMMER THERE IS A LOT OF HAY AND  
 SILAGE MAKING.THERE IS VERY LITTLE    
 INDUSTRY HERE AND NOT MANY JOBS,PEOPLE
 HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THE TOWNS AROUND    
 (WREXHAM,OSWESTRY,CHESTER,SHREWSBURY) 
 TO WORK. THE A5 ROAD RUNS NORTH TO    
 SOUTH ACROSS OUR AREA AND IS VERY     
 BUSY.THERE IS ALSO A RAILWAY AND THE  
 SHROPSHIRE UNION CANAL.IT IS A VERY   
 PEACEFUL PART OF THE COUNTRY, BUT     
 YOUNG PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THERE IS   
 NOT ENOUGH TO DO.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
