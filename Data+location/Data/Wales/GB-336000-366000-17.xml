		<title>17Blacon Library</title>
		<content>   The library was built in 1968 and   
 covers an area of 486 sq.m. It was    
 well-stocked with books when new, but 
 now there is a lack of money to fully 
 replenish book stocks, provide more   
 full-time trained staff or open more. 
   Nevertheless, friendly staff strive 
 to provide a library geared to the    
 needs of the locality. Despite fewer  
 books, the shelves do not look empty  
 and uninviting - they have been       
 altered to provide notice board or    
 display space. Advice on everyday     
 problems like tax and welfare benefits
 is available and local information. On
 Saturday mornings, local councillors  
 hold a 'surgery' at the library.      
 People are encouraged to read the wide
 range of newspapers and periodicals in
 the refernce room, or swap magazines. 
 East chairs have been put in.Children 
 may call in to play games like chess. </content>
