		<content> BP Plastics sports and social club is 
 a nice place to go. There is a        
 football pitch and some swings and    
 slides. There is a bar, a place to    
 eat, tennis courts, bowling and it is 
 near the sea. There is a car park,    
 rugby pitches, cricket pitches and    
 toilets. It is very nice on a hot day.
 There are some trees, shrubs and a lot
 of grass. The Sully community council 
 have rented a half of it for the Sully
 Colts football teams to use and for   
 other villages who want to use the    
 facilities of the sports club.
