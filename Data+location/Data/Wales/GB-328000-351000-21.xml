<title>21Tan y fron 2011</title>
<content>

The village of Tan y fron has changed extensively since the 80's. Since the demise of the steel works the community has lost a lot of it's community spirit. You still have large families groups still resident within the old Tan y fron village, nowadays, a lot of integration of 'outsiders' has nibbled away at the solid community spirit. &lt;br />&lt;br />The Fourwinds local pub shut down, predominately because of a landlord who was eager to make a living from a community who now didn't have the social monetary funds that it once had. The Brymbo Sports and Social Complex ( The Cric), still maintains it's position as the village's local pub. &lt;br />&lt;br />With the 'extension' of the village due to the large new housing developments, the infrastructure is struggling to cope. The local nursery, infants and junior school is oversubscribed every year. Although a new school is on the drawing board, albeit, outside of the village but within 3 miles. The main road that was laid to feed the steelworks is now busy again, not with tons of steel but commuters.   &lt;br />
