		<content> The various cement works and ancillary
 buildings were built after the first  
 world war.                            
 What follows are the recollections of 
 an electrical engineer who served his 
 apprenticeship at the Cement Works    
 from 1944 until August 1949.          
 "I went there when I was fifteen and a
 half but had to wait until I was      
 sixteen to become an apprentice. I was
 paid six shilling a week for the first
 year. We started work at seven o'clock
 in the morning until five o'clock. On 
 Saturdays we had to work from 7 till  
 12 noon.                              
 In those days, before I had a motor   
 bike I used to catch the train from   
 Barry Station at 6.25 a.m. Of course  
 the line is now only used for goods   
 trains and emergencies.               
 I had to do general maintenance work, 
 on switchgear, wiring and motors."    </content>
