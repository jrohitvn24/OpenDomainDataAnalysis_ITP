		<content> When we start school we have an       
 assembly,then when we come in we      
 either read or do our timetables.My   
 favourite subjects are maths,history  
 and geography.My worst subject is     
 science.School dinners are at quarter 
 past twelve.I enjoy cooked dinners and
 chips,but my sister is choosy and only
 likes chips.When we get home my mum is
 usually watching Sons and Daughters or
 Young Docters.On Monday we have piano 
 lessons for three quarters of an hour 
 each,my sister Kathryn is on grade 1  
 and I am on grade lV we will be having
 our examinations in June .In the      
 evening we have tea and watch the     
 television we enjoy watching          
 Dynasty,Dallas,Eastenders and Roll    
 Over Beethoven.They are our favourite 
 programmes,we go to bed at nine       
 o'clock but mum and dad go later.We   
 read for an hour and then go to sleep.</content>
