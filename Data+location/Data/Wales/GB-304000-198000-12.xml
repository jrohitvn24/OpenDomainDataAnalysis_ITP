		<title>12MINERS STRIKE 1984/85</title>
		<content> The mining communities of Mountain Ash
 and Aberfan were seriously affected by
 the miners'strike.Families on strike, 
 were without pay for almost a year and
 many had problems paying the every day
 household bills such as mortgages,    
 electricity,gas and food.People were  
 to be seen outside supermarkets,      
 collecting tins and other various     
 items of food. These were then taken  
 to special distribution centres and   
 shared out amongst mining families.   
 All of the miners' children in our    
 school had free meals during the      
 strike even in the school holidays.   
 Toys were collected for Christmas     
 presents and some children in our town
 had holidays paid for them by miners  
 and trade unionists in other countries
 such as France and Belgium.
