		<content>   Mr Ifor Williams has worked at      
 Deganwy Station for 47 years,and feels
 that the L.M.S. was a better employer 
 than British Rail.In 1950 the station 
 was much busier than today.The average
 number of people travelling on the    
 train for one week day in 1985 is 200 
 daily .In 1950 around 70 steam trains 
 daily went towards Llandudno and 80   
 towards Llandudno Junction.Today 40   
 diesel engines go towards Llandudno   
 and 45 towards Llandudno Junction.In  
 1950,eighty trains stopped daily in   
 Deganwy,while today 64 stop.12 people,
 including a Station Master were       
 employed in 1950,while today only four
 persons are employed without a Station
 Master.
