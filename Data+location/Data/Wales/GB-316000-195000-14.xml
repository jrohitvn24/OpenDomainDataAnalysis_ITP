		<title>14Mr.Jackson's Farm.</title>
		<content>      Mr.Jackson employs one full time 
 helper with additional temporary help 
 to bale hay used as Winter feed for   
 the cattle. The lambing season in     
 February and March is the busiest time
 of the year. He has about 100 sheep   
 and 80 beef cattle.                   
      Mr.Jackson visits markets at     
 Abergavenny, Nelson and Newport to buy
 and sell his produce. He gets up at 7 
 a.m. every day. Machinery found on the
 farm includes:-                       
 tractors, rollers, bulldozer, mowers, 
 manure spreaders, livestock box and   
 harrows. Mr.Jackson thinks that to be 
 a farmer you have to be interested in 
 and fond of animals. You also need    
 financial backing to begin with.
