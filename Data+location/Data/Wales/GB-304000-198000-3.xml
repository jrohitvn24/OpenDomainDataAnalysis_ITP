		<title>03FALLING SCHOOL ROLLS</title>
		<content> The drop in the birth rate has had a  
 considerable efect on schools in this 
 area.Falling rolls have cut the size  
 of these schools drastically.Many     
 schools have had to lose teachers as  
 class sizes have fallen.Most of the   
 primary schools now support mixed age 
 classes.For example:-                 
{Standard 1 and 2                      
{Standard 3 and 4                      
                                       
 The drop in the number of pupils has  
 also affected sport.In a traditionally
 strong rugby union area,most primary  
 schools find it impossible to field   
 sides.However there are still active  
 sporting traditions within the area.  
 There is a 5 a side football league,an
 X1 a side cup,a netball tournament for
 the girls,together with cricket and   
 rounders during the summer
