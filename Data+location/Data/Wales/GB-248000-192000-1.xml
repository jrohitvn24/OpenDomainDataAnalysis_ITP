		<content> OVER HALF THE QUADRANT IS SALT MARSH  
 AND ESTUARY.                          
 THE SOUTH WEST (LOWER LEFT) CORNER OF 
 THE QUADRANT IS LIMESTONE AT 60 METRES
 SLOPING SHARPLY DOWN TO THE MARSH. IT 
 IS ON THIS SLOPE THAT THE VILLAGE OF  
 LLANRHIDIAN AND ITS CHURCH IS FOUND.  
 THE SOUTH EAST OF THE QUADRANT IS     
 MILLSTONE GRIT AND THERE ARE LARGE    
 TRACTS OF MOORLAND SUCH AS WELSH MOOR 
 AND THE HIGH GROUND OF CIL IFOR TOP.  
 TOWARDS THE NORTH EAST IS THE EDGE OF 
 THE LOWER COAL SERIES AND HERE IS     
 FOUND THE SMALL HAMLET OF WERNFFRWD.
