		<title>05FARMING-TIRLAS GOCH.</title>
		<content> Tirlas Goch Farm is owned by          
 Pilkintons but managed by Mr Lee. The 
 only produce of the farm is milk about
 1800 litres on average per day.The    
 milk is kept in a large refridgerated 
 tank.The cows are all machine milked  
 as it would take well over a day to   
 milk them all by hand.The milking     
 parlour will hold about 24 cows at a  
 time.In the middle of the parlour was 
 a pit where the person involved would 
 connect the cows to the milking       
 machine.The number of cows in the herd
 is about 160.With 120 cows milking and
 about 40 dried off(which means they   
 have stopped producing milk).The      
 oldest cow in the herd is about 12    
 years old.When she grows old she will 
 be sold for milk.This year there were 
 about 140 calves born,most of these   
 will be sold for meat after being     
 treated with growth chemicals.        </content>
