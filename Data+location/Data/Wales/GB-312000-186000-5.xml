            There are many small       
 mammals - mice, rats, voles, rabbits, 
 moles, grey squirrels, hedgehogs and  
 foxes. We can often see kestrels      
 hovering. Buzzards too can often be   
 seen,as well as tawny owls, barn owls,
 and little owls. We have an abundance 
 of garden birds. The commonest are    
 house sparrows, starlings and         
 chaffinches. Most of the tit family   
 are here - and the nuthatch and tree  
 creeper are sometimes to be seen.     
 Swallows, house martins,swifts and    
 cuckoos are summer visitors.          
                                       
            The castle moat, where     
 there are mallards, tufted ducks and  
 greylag geese to feed and study, is a 
 popular place with small children.
