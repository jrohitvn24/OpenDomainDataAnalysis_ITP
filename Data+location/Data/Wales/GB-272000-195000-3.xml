		<content> A Typical School Week.                
 In Maths we did measurements,angles   
 and directions,graphs,maps and        
 co-ordinates.First of all we did      
 measurements.We had to trace a map of 
 a garden then we had to measure       
 different lines.We were finding the   
 correct scale.Then we did degrees.We  
 had to draw a circle and then we putin
 numbers which went up in tens.We then 
 used this to make a compass.After this
 we did co-ordinates.                  
 After we we had finished all our      
 maths we did English.First we had to  
 read the passage then answer questions
 on it.Then we had punctuation.Another 
 thing we had to do in English was an  
 essay about the Easter Holidays.I     
 wrote one and a half pages.During the 
 week we also have Art/Craft and       
 Games.Sometimes we have Geography and 
 Music.                                </content>
