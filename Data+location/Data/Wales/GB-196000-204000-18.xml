		<title>18THE NEYLAND RAILWAY (2)</title>
		<content>   The station was opened in{August    
{1855}and was a great success.         
                                       
   The first passengers arrived from   
 Ireland in 1856.But changes were to   
 come,for the{Great Western Railway,}as
 it was now called, decided to build a 
 port at Goodwick in North             
 Pembrokeshire, in 1906. From then on  
 Neyland declined in importance. It was
 estimated that 400 people left Neyland
 to live in Goodwick.                  
                                       
{  The last train left the station}on  
 Sunday June 14th. 1964.               
                                       
   Now the line has disappeared and    
 Brunel's Quay is part of the new      
{Westfield Marina.
