		<title>03 Local History of Cwmbran</title>
		<content>   The name Cwmbran is reputed to have 
 derived from "Bran", the father of    
 Caradoc, although these days the      
 English translation of Cwmbran is     
 generally taken to be "Valley of the  
 Crows".                               
   The Monmouthshire-Brecon canal runs 
 behind our school and skirts the edge 
 of the new town. It was built in 1792 
 and carried iron and coal to the docks
 in Newport.                           
   Llantarnam Abbey, a very historic   
 building, is now a convent, and houses
 the Sisters of St. Joseph. It was once
 owned by R.J.Blewitt, an 18th century 
 owner of the local iron works. During 
 World War II it was used as a depot   
 for the RAF.
