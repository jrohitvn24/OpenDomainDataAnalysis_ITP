		<title>09Ecology _ Leeswood area</title>
		<content>  The ecology of this area is typical  
 of grassland areas, of which the area 
 is mainly composed.Most of the fields 
 are separated by hedges of quickthorn 
 or blackthorn.                        
   In the woods there are small mammals
 which include squirrels,mice,hedgehogs
 badgers and rabbits which are fascina_
 ting to see.                          
   There is a wide range of insects to 
 see such as crickets,grasshoppers and 
 different kinds of spiders etc.       
  We have several streams in the area  
 and a large pond which has several    
 varieties of coarse fish.The pond pro-
 vides homes for frogs and other       
 amphibians.                           
  This area is peaceful and is lovely  
 for going on nature walks.
