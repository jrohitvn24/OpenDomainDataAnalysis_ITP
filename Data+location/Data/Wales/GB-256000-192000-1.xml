		<title>01DUNVANT,THREE CROSSES,KILLAY</title>
		<content>  The area contains the nuclei of three
 villages,Dunvant,Three Crosses and    
 Upper Killay which grew in the 19th.  
 century due to the development of coal
 mining and quarrying.These activities 
 have ceased.Today the villages strive 
 to retain their identities against the
 tide of urban sprawl which threatens  
 to make them suburbs of Swansea. This 
 is especially so in the case of       
 Dunvant where proposed plans to extend
 residential development bring fears   
 that what rural aspect remains will be
 lost.New residents have shown a marked
 interest in the villages retaining    
 their indentities and their enthusiasm
 has rejuvenated a number of local     
 societies.Welsh used to be the        
 predominant language of the area but, 
 with the influx of English-speaking   
 residents,the native language is now  
 rarely heard.                         </content>
