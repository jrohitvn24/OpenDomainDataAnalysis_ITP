		<title>02Tabernacle Chapel,Pontypridd</title>
		<content> This Welsh Baptist Chapel was built in
 1810 near the Old Bridge in Pontypridd
 The present Coed-y-lan Primary School 
 started in Tabernacle on Feb.6th 1893.
 The chapel is now being converted into
 a historical/cultural centre.The      
 basement will be used by local        
 societies.On the ground floor and in  
 the gallery there will be exhibitions 
 showing the history of Pontypridd;    
 maps,books and photographs of the old 
 town and district.The beautiful organ,
 which was installed in 1910,is to     
 remain but will be converted into an  
 electronic organ.The decorated ceiling
 and stained glass windows are being   
 restored.The total cost of the work is
 estimated at Â£250,000.Pontypridd town 
 council is paying for the interior    
 work and the EEC for the exterior.It  
 is hoped that the centre will open on 
 Mar 1st 1986. (from Coed-y-lan school)</content>
