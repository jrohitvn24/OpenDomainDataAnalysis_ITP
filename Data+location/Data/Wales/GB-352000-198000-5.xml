		<title>05RESIDENTS' OPINIONS</title>
		<content>  The residents are equally divided    
 between those whose families have     
 lived in the area for generations     
 and those who have chosen to move to  
 this area because of its beauty even  
 though their place of employment may  
 be as far away as London.This division
 is reflected in their attitudes,the   
 former expressing great concern over  
 the lack of public transport,large    
 shops and places of entertainment,the 
 latter having a strong desire to      
 retain the unspoilt nature of the     
 area.                                 
  The concern which unites all         
 residents is that of low flying       
 aircraft,this being a designated area 
 for low flying practice by the Royal  
 Air Force.Within the valley planes fly
 lower than some houses,vibrate        
 buildings and cause distress to humans
 and livestock.                        </content>
