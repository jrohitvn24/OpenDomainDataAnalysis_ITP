		<content>  The area under consideration is a    
 plateau which lies between the river  
 Ithon and Gilwern Hill(439 metres).The
 generous amount of rainfall 40-45     
 inches p.a. runs rapidly off the hills
 via various streams the most important
 of which cuts the Ithon between Howey 
 and Disserth.Clay makes for poor soil.
 To the east of Howey and adjacent to  
 Llandrindod lake,there are several    
 relict areas of deciduous woodland.   
  The broadleaf woodland is important. 
 Its avifauna are representative of    
 Welsh oakwood birds. In addition to   
 their indigenous population of        
 avifauna,the pools and river Ithon are
 of regional significance for their    
 dragonflies.Land improvement schemes  
 (drainage and reseeding) have affected
 old meadows and damp grassland with   
 concomitant effects on the flora and  
 fauna of certain areas.               </content>
