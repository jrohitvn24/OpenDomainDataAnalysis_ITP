 Although English is the predominant   
 language of the town the Welsh        
 language can be heard on the streets  
 and in the shops.                     
 The majority of those people who speak
 Welsh are the senior section of the   
 population,that is those people who   
 moved into the town from the country. 
 The schools have a bilingual policy,  
 and specialist teachers are employed  
 to travel from school to school to    
 aid classroom teachers.               
 Many of the schoolchildren can        
 understand simple instructions in     
 Welsh but only a few can hold a       
 prolonged conversation in Welsh.
