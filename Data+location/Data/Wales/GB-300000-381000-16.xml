		<title>16NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD, RHYL</title>
		<content>  The Eisteddfod is a Welsh cultural   
 festival held during the first week of
 August, in N. Wales one year, in S.   
 Wales the next. The Bards of the      
 Gorsedd perform the crowning and      
 chairing ceremonies which can be seen 
 in the Pavilion. The Gorsedd honour a 
 number of people, chosen for their    
 service to Wales or for having been   
 successful in the Gorsedd examinations
 and they wear green, blue, white and  
 gold robes.                           
  On the Tuesday and Thursday morning  
 of Eisteddfod week a ceremony is held 
 and lots of people come to see it. The
 Archdruid comes dressed in his gold   
 robes. On the Eisteddfod field there  
 will be the Main Pavilion, many       
 smaller pavilions, stalls and side    
 shows all using the Welsh language.
