		<title>10SAILING IN PONTSTICILL</title>
		<content> Dolygaer Outdoor Pursuits Centre near 
 Pontsticill offers junior children the
 chance to sail on Pontsticill reser_  
 voir.So while we were in Dolygaer we  
 had the opportunity to sail and we    
 took it.First of all when we got onto 
 the boat we put up the jib sail by    
 clipping the sail onto a stay and     
 pulling a rope down.Next we hauled up 
 the main sail,attached to the bottom  
 of it is a boom which fits onto the   
 mast.We put the rudder into the water 
 at the back of the boat and attached  
 the tiller to it.We put the centre    
 board into the water to make the boat 
 go in a straight line.We released the 
 boat from the mooring and set sail.Our
 instructor would shout"Ready about!"  
 the crew shouted "All clear",then he  
 would shout "Lee ho!"and push the     
 tiller hard across to turn the boat.We
 enjoyed our day sailing very much.    </content>
