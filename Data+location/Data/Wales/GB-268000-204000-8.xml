   {Sheep dipping }time is also a very 
 busy time for the Davies family. At   
 the beginning of July sheep must be   
 dipped to prevent diseases like sheep 
 scab and to stop maggot flies laying  
 their eggs in the sheep's wool. The   
 sheep are pushed into a large bath    
 filled with a special disinfectant.   
    Sheep are weighed and when they are
 fat enough they are taken to Builth   
 Wells, 50 miles away, to be           
 slaughtered. When new stock has to be 
 bought the Davies' visit Neath or     
 Carmarthen markets.                   
   In the winter the animals are kept  
 in sheds and fed on silage. This is   
 grass which has been cut, put into big
 piles, clamped and sealed in airtight 
 bags. The Davies' do not have         
 machinery for this so they have       
 contractors to do it.                 </content>
