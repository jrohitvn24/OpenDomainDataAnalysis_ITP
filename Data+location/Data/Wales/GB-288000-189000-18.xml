		<content>  How different the valley in the      
 strike of 1984. So many of the pits   
 are closed that there was little      
 visible effect of any hardship.       
 Schools provided free meals for miners
 children during the week, on saturday 
 and during the holidays.Womens groups 
 made up food parcels and mine leaders 
 organised fetes to raise strike funds.
 There was still much evidence of      
 unity, goodwill and community spirit  
 but we all know that the valley has   
 changed for all time from its heyday  
 in the mining area.                   
  Education is not treasured as before 
 but if the region continues to develop
 its potential as a residential area   
 and if opportunities become more      
 limited to qualified personnel, then  
 perhaps its value will be restored.
