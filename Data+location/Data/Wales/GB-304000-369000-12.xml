		<content> We met a lady called Mrs. Jones. She  
 works part-time as a domesic at the   
 local hospital.                       
 She has lived in Trefnant for35 years 
 and said that she really liked it     
 there. She lives on the Council Estate
 but was not bothered by the amount of 
 traffic going through almost every day
 and night.                            
 She told us her husband had died a    
 year ago and she feels really lonely. 
 Her favorite TV programmes are Dallas,
 Crossroads, and Coronation Street.
