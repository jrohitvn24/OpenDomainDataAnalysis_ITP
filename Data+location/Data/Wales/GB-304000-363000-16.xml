		<title>16Smithfield market Denbigh</title>
		<content>   Our first impression of{Smithfield  
 market was of a{very busy}scene with  
{Land-Rovers + trailers and large      
{cattle wagons}constantly turning on to
 the large car park. Signs on the      
 wagons showed that people had         
{travelled}from all over{N.Wales}to    
 attend this{Fat stock market}held     
 every{Tuesday.}Animals were unloaded  
 and the{Beef cattle, sheep and lambs  
 taken to be{weighed}and{graded}before 
 being penned ready for{auction,}mainly
 to{butchers}and{wholesalers.          
   Small groups of farmers are         
 scattered about the market place      
 engaged in conversation. Such topics  
 as milk quotas, grant reductions,     
 market prices, weather conditions and 
 the odd bargain are regularly         
 discussed -the market place being     
 the ideal place for mixing business   
 with pleasure.                        </content>
