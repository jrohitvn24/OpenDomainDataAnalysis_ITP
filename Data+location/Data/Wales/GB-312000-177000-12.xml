		<title>12Llandaff Cathedral today.</title>
		<content> The Catherdal is the impressive centre
 of religious and social life of       
 Llandaff and is a hive of activity    
 every day of the week.                
    The Bishop is assisted by the Dean,
 Vicar and 3 Priests. The most popular 
 Sunday service is the parish Eucharist
 at 9:00 am. The Holy Eucharist at     
 12:15 is the least well attended.     
    10 pupils of our school are members
 of the Parish Choir and 57 attend the 
 Cathedral Sunday School. Many active  
 clubs and societies are connected with
 the Cathedral, including the Young    
 Wives, Mother's Union, The Men's      
 Society, Guides and Scouts. Every day 
 Tourists visit the ancient building   
 and view the Majestas by Epstein.
