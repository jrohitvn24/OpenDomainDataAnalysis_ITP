		<title>16Sport/Leisure in Pontyclun</title>
		<content> Pontyclun is reasonably well          
 provided with sporting and leisure    
 facilities.In the early years of this 
 century it was felt that the rapidly  
 growing community sorely needed a     
 social centre.Accordingly, the local  
 squire, Godfrey Clarke, built the     
 Pontyclun Institute in 1910.Bowls,    
 tennis and a variety of indoor games  
 were provided.The institute provided a
 very valuable service for years, even 
 being used as an army hospital in     
 World War 1.Some years ago it was     
 decided that the Rugby,Soccer and     
 Cricket Clubs of the district should  
 have a common centre and the Institute
 was put to that use.The sporting clubs
 have their own sports fields and in   
 the Rugby Club's case, its own        
 Clubhouse.In the adjacent areas there 
 is also a Leisure Centre,a Golf Club a
 Cricket Club and a 400m running track.</content>
