		<content> Gellifor is a quiet village from which
 most people travel away to work.Many  
 travel a great distance to their      
 workplace,but communications are quite
 good.Unemployment affects this area as
 much as everywhere else.There has been
 a lot of movement of population over  
 the years with older people coming to 
 retire as well as families with young 
 children.Many of the young people have
 to leave the area to find work.People 
 come here from all parts of the       
 U.K.The majority of the older         
 population speak Welsh,but there is a 
 gradual change and at present only    
 five children from fortyfive at the   
 school speak Welsh as a first         
 language.
