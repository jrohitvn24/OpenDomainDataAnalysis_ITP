		<content>   The area surveyed by our school     
 consists of the villages of Llanhari  
 and Pontyclun together with parts of  
 Llanharan and Talbot Green.Since the  
 implementation of boundary changes in 
 1985,most of the area surveyed lies   
 within the communities of Llanhari    
 and Pontyclun.In 1981 the community of
 Llanhari had a population of 2550 and 
 the community of Pontyclun had a      
 population of 4090.The M4 motorway    
 runs through the southern half of the 
 area surveyed and the main London-    
 South Wales railway line crosses the  
 area from north-west to south-east.   
   Data was collected by three schools,
 Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari, Llanhari Primary
 School and Pontyclun Primary School.  
   Pages 1-11 were written by pupils
