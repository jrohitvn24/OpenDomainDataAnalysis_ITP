		<title>15     UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>   The{unemployment figures}in this    
 area have{increased sharply}since     
{1972.                                 
   The figures shown below are for the 
{Blaenavon to Cwmbran}area as there are
 no figures for our D-Block area alone.
  {In 1972, 5.7%}of the population (men
 and women who were looking for employ-
 ment) were unemployed.                
  {In 1981,}this figure had risen to   
{13.9%                                 
  {Now in 1985,}the unemployment figure
 for the above mentioned area is{14,%  
 and this is likely to rise in the     
 future.                               
   Mine closures and fewer job         
 oppotunities in the area would seem   
 to indicate hardship in the future for
 this area.
