		<title>04Deeside Industrial Estate</title>
		<content> The fist part of the Industrial Estate
 was formed at the end of the 19th     
 century when British Steel reclaimed  
 marsh land which covered 980 acres.In 
 this land many miles of roadways and  
 also railways were laid out to enable 
 British Steel to transport the steel  
 they made to their customers.Later the
 Welsh Development Agency bought part  
 of R.A.F.Sealand and transformed this 
 into the part of Deeside Idustrial    
 Estate.When the government decided to 
 finish steel making at Shotton in     
 1980.British Steel provided 500 acres 
 of land to the Welsh Development      
 Agency to help to create more jobs for
 the people of Deeside and the many    
 redundant Steel workers.Such firms as 
 Harrison Monarch,Hyphen,Wirral        
 Builders,Squibb Surgicare took        
 advantage of the offer of 3 years'    
 rent-free tenancy of small factories. </content>
