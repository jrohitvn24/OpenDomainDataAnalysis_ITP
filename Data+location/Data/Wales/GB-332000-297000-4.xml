		<content> The church overlooks the village and  
 is surrounded by the graveyard. The   
 most recent grave is dated 1983 and   
 the oldest we found  was dated 1835.  
 There appeared to be too many graves  
 for the small village. The windows are
 arched with small diamond shaped      
 pieces of stained glass. There is a   
 cross on the roof. There is an iron   
 gate which was unlocked. There were   
 many lilies growing around the graves.
 Inside the very small church, which is
 served by an itinerant vicar,there is 
 a tiny gallery with one bellrope.     
 There is also a visitors book.
