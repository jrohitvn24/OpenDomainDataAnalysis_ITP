		<title>18Transport in Caerhun Parish</title>
		<content> There is no public transport directly 
 serving this area. A bus service from 
 Llandudno and Conwy to Llanrwst runs  
 through the lower end of Rowen and    
 along the main road near Llanbedr     
 every two hours. Most people have     
 their own cars, which is essential in 
 this hilly rural area. Those without  
 rely on the goodwill of their         
 car-owning neighbours for lifts. There
 was resistance to the suggestion of   
 having a bus service into Llanbedr    
 village. Residents preferred to keep  
 the village quiet and did not mind the
 walk to the bus stop on the road.
