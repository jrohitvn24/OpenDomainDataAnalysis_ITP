		<content>     This is my school.It is a Junior  
 Primary School and has children from  
 seven to eleven years old.Children    
 come here from Ysgol Bryn Golau,the   
 Infant School.The school was opened in
 1977 and is a modern design called    
 'an open plan school'.This means that 
 the classrooms or bases have no doors 
 only curtains.                        
     The headmaster is Mr.M.Hopwood and
 the Deputy Headmaster is Mr.A.Owens.  
 There are nine other teachers.This    
 year, 1985, we have 250 children      
 divided into nine classes.            
     The fourth year classes are taught
 in wooden huts outside because there  
 is not enough space for them in the   
 main building.                        
      When we leave we go to Bryn Alyn.
 This was opened in 1972.The school has
 over 1000 pupils.
