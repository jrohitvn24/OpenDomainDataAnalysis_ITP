		<title>07Farming 1 - Little Bottom Fm</title>
		<content> Little Bottom Farm is situated \ mile 
 south of Wrenrhyeolydd.               
 As we arrived in the farmyard we were 
 greeted by 3 snarling sheep dogs and  
 an array of panic stricken chickens.  
 Bottom Farm has 150 acres of land and 
 is mainly concerned with sheep and    
 beef cattle. But htey are very proud  
 of their 5 acres of orchards. They    
 have 450 apple trees and some plum    
 trees. The cider apples are havested  
 around August-September and sold to   
 Bulmers cider factory in Hereford. The
 farmers wife estimated that 2 tons of 
 cider apples are picked each year from
 the old trees. They have just planted 
 250 young trees. In a barn by the yard
 we were shown the farmer's hobby-     
 peacocks. They had 4 hens and 3 cocks,
 all of them just 1 year old. A full   
 grown cock was strutting about the    
 farm grounds.                         </content>
