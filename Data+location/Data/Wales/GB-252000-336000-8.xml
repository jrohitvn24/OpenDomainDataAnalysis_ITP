 busy organizing fund-raising events to
 repair and improve the property.It is 
 let at a low rent to various clubs and
 societies and is fully booked during  
 the winter.It is regularly used by a  
 dance club,Welsh learners,computer    
 club,sewing classes,men's circuit     
 training,women's keep fit,ramblers'   
 club and the Women's Institute.       
 Occasional events are organized like  
 card games,slide shows and public     
 meetings about matters of concern to  
 the community.The most popular event  
 of the year is the Carol Evening,which
 includes a visit from Father Christmas
 and a feast of mince pies.
