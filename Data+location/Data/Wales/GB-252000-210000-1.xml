		<content> The block contains the villages of    
 Tumble and Cwmmawr with 29 farms on   
 the fringes of both. The village of   
 Tumble is reputedly with others one of
 the largest in Wales. It has been     
 divided into two, Lower and Upper     
 Tumble. Population is approx. 3 000.  
 For Local Government purposes the area
 comes under Dyfed C.C., Llanelli B.C. 
 and Llannon Community Council.        
   Both villages are linked to the M4, 
 A48 and the A476 by the B4310 which   
 also joins the B4317 at Cwmmawr.      
   The landscape surrounding both      
 villages is predominantly rough       
 grassland with small man made         
 plantations of coniferous trees and   
 small natural deciduous forests.      
 Running from N.E. to S.W. there is a  
 ridge with the highest point being    
 246m. The land drops suddenly to the  
 N.W. down to the River Gwendraeth Fawr</content>
