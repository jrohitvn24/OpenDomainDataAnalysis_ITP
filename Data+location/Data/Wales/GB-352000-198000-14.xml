		<title>14FARMING</title>
		<content>  Sheep and cattle graze the           
 comparatively small area of farm land 
 available,just as they did when the   
 monks first farmed the area hundreds  
 of years ago.The only noticeable      
 change is that one of the two main    
 farms,that on the Gwent side of the   
 river,now grows potatoes,various      
 vegetables and soft fruits for the    
 'pick-your-own' trade which has become
 very popular in the 1980's.The other  
 main farm,along the highest point of  
 the Gloucestershire area,Which is     
 predominantly a sheep farm,has now    
 developed a large caravan park.       
  On a south facing bank on the        
 northern edge of the area a vineyard  
 is being developed utilising the      
 reasonably equable climate provided by
 the warming influence of the Gulf     
 Stream.
