		<title>19Law and Order, Wye Valley.</title>
		<content>    A local police constable was       
 interviewed to find out about life as 
 a policeman and law and order in this 
 area. The type of work that the P.C.  
 does is patrolling the main streets of
 Monmouth, controlling traffic,        
 attending road accidents, visiting    
 schools, advising on shop security,   
 arresting shoplifters, keeping public 
 order and visiting scenes of          
 burglaries. There are about 25 police 
 men stationed at Monmouth.            
    The main crimes committed in this  
 area are poaching salmon from the     
 River Wye and deer. The other main    
 crime is burglary. Poachers catch the 
 salmon by spreading large nets across 
 the river at night. They sell the     
 salmon to hotels and public houses.   
 Burglaries are common because of the  
 high number of isolated houses and    
 because it is an affluent area.       </content>
