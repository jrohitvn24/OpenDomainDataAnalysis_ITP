 Mr.Ansteys grandchildren have endless 
 choices of leisure pursuits,but when  
 he was a boy his main delight was the 
 boxing matches arranged with the local
 lads in the fields.Apart from these   
 matches there were games with         
 marbles,bow and arrows,cricket and    
 football.Outings organised by the     
 Parish were enjoyed by all the        
 community.Although Mr.Anstey regrets  
 many changes he appreciates some have 
 been for the better.Mechanisation has 
 made the day to day running of the    
 farm much easier.More generally a     
 change which has affected the lot of  
 the common man greatly the National   
 Health service,is praised by Mr.Anstey
 Mr.Anstey's intimate knowledge of the 
 area over a number of years gives an  
 invaluable insight into changes that  
 have taken place over the years.      </content>
