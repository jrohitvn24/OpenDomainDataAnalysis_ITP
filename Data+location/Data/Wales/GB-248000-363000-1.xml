 The area we are describing contains   
 most of the town of Caernarfon and a  
 small area of S.W.Anglesey in         
 N.W.Wales.A stretch of the Menai      
 Straits is also included.             
 Caernarfon is the county town of      
 Gwynedd.It is in the centre of the    
 Welsh speaking heartland of Wales.    
 The town is dominated by the castle   
 built by Edward 1st in the 13th       
 Century.The traffic problems in the   
 town have been alleviated when a new  
 fly over was built during the 1970's. 
 The farms in the area are small family
 run units.The oldest remains in the   
 area are the Celtic settlement at     
 Twtil and the Roman Fort at Segontium.
 There are two statues on the Maes at  
 Caernarfon one of David Lloyd George  
 and the other is of Syr Hugh Owen.    </content>
