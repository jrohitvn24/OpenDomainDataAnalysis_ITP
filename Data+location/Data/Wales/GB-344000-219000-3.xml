		<title>03Skenfrith Castle</title>
		<content>  Skenfrith Castle,Grosmont Castle and 
 White Castle were all controlled by   
 the Crown during the reign of Henry   
 II.Together they dominated the area   
 between the Wye and the Black         
 Mountains.They became known as 'The   
 Three Castles'                        
  The castle at Skenfrith consists of a
 rectangular grassed area enclosed by a
 stone wall which is practically as    
 high as it was originally.There is a  
 drum tower at each corner plus one    
 other tower in the middle of the west 
 side.A round tower stands in the      
 centre.There is evidence that the     
 castle was surrounded on three sides  
 by a 2.7m deep moat, the River Monnow 
 forming protection on the east side.  
  Most of the remains of the castle    
 date from the first half of the       
 thirteenth century.
