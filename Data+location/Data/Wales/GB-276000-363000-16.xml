		<content> This eastern side of the area is a    
 region where deteriorating services   
 cause anxiety about the survival of   
 the existing scattered community. Few 
 houses have main services - most rely 
 on wells or streams, and septic tanks 
 are universal.Cars are a necessity as 
 buses are infrequent and seasonal,    
 though a special bus conveys children 
 to school.                            
  There is fierce resistance to        
 threatened closure of the primary     
 school,which teaches through the      
 medium of Welsh,spoken locally. The   
 school is the main focus of local     
 activities, such as whist drives and  
 the May Day Rose Queen festival.      
  There is no local policeman, the     
 nearest being in Llanrwst, and there  
 is only one public telephone in this  
 locality.
