		<title>19THE MOUNTAIN OVER CADOXTON-1</title>
		<content>    The most famous thing on the       
 mountain behind our school is the{Golf
{Club.}People come from all over the   
 place to play there. It is a large    
 course,covering{approximately 220     
{acres of land.}It was founded in 1934 
 by a man called Mr.J.Braid,with only a
 few members but today the membership  
 is 570. The course is mostly mountain 
 pasture but there are many shrubs as  
 well as coniferous and deciduous trees
 dotted around the area.               
    Also on top of the mountain are two
{farms - Ty-Draw and Gelli-march.      
 Mrs.E.Price owns Ty-Draw and the farm 
 covers 90 acres of land. The land-use 
 is mostly rough-grazing,so the farmer 
 specialises in keeping store cattle.  
 There are 34 cattle on the farm at    
 present;they are bought from Neath    
 Cattle Market,kept for a year and sold
 again at the same market.             </content>
