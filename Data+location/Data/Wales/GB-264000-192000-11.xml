 The person I questioned about the     
 Blitz was my granny Lilly Jones.      
 'The war broke out in 1939. I was 14  
 years old and had just left school.   
 The windows had to be blacked out and 
 the streets were very dark. Every     
 street had an ARP warden. Every street
 had to have a water pump, ladder and  
 bags of sand. I remember helping my   
 father to put out an incendery bomb.  
 These were sent before the big bombs  
 so that the pilots knew their targets.
 A bomb was about 10 yards from where I
 lived, in Dyfatty school. I was in the
 Elysium cinema when all of a sudden   
 the sirens went and a bomb was dropped
 near to the cinema. We all had to get 
 outside and lie in the gutter until it
 had passed.'                          </content>
