		<title>08Home Improvements.</title>
		<content> Due to most of the houses being old in
 our area people have to spend quite a 
 lot of money repairing them.We decided
 to study a typical street to see just 
 how many houses in that street had    
 been repaired.As we could not really  
 expect people to let us inside their  
 houses the survey only noted outside  
 improvements.There were 30 houses in  
 the street.These were the results.    
 New roofs-10                          
 New windows-15                        
 New doors-27                          
 New pebble dash-10                    
 All four improvements-2               
 From this you can see that people have
 to spend quite a lot of money on their
 houses so that they can continue to   
 look nice.
