		<content> This area has been grazed since the   
 Iron Age out of neighbouring Hill     
 Forts which are still very much in    
 evidence archaeologically.            
 Existing farms have their roots in the
 Feudal System.The Welsh word "Plas"   
 means "Manor",and farms bearing       
 this name, e.g. "Plas y Ward" &amp;"Plas  
 yr Esgob"(Esgob=Bishop) exist         
 today,denoting Church as well as      
 gentry ownership.                     
 Farms today range from approx.150-250 
 acres with Dairy Farming predominant  
 on the best land and sheep grazing on 
 the more difficult terrain.Most feed  
 crops are grown.Silage has taken over 
 from hay as part of the general       
 mechanisation of farming in the       
 region.Some farms are owned but most  
 are tenanted.
