		<title>10Mynydd Newydd</title>
		<content> Mynydd Newydd in English is{"New      
{Mountain".}Today Mynydd Newydd playing
 fields has facilities for Rugby,      
 Association Football,Cricket and      
 Netball.The area used to be a coal    
 mine called{"Mynydd Newydd Colliery",}
 so when it rains the pitches become   
 practically unplayable,because the    
 coal under the ground doesn't let the 
 water drain away quickly enough.      
    The Colliery was opened in{1840}and
 was abandoned in{1933}because of      
 floods.In{1844}there was an explosion.
 Five miners were killed. With the     
 owners consent the miners built two   
 underground chapels hewn out of coal, 
 they built these in memory of the     
 miners.They met in these chapels every
 Monday at 6 a.m. for a Prayer Meeting.
 These must be two of the most unusual 
 chapels in recorded history.
