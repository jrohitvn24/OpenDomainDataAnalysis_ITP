		<content> The Forestry Commission has planted   
 thousands of conifers which include   
 Japanese Larch, Conican Pine, Lodge   
 Pole, Pine, Norway Spruce, Sitka      
 Spruce and Scotch Pine.               
 Tree felling has been going on in the 
 Ogmore Forest for a number of years.  
 In certain parts of the valley, trees 
 such as Siver Bush, Rowan, Apple      
 Blossom have been planted to make the 
 area look more attractive. Last year  
 children from the school planted Rowan
 and Silver Bush Trees just outside the
 school as part of the National Tree   
 Planting Week.                        
 The laregest broadleaved woodland is  
 the Aber woods which consists mainly  
 of oak trees. There is a Tree         
 Preservation Order covering a group of
 mixed hardwoods in the gounds of      
 Gorwyl House, Ogmore Vale.
