		<content>{St. Illtyd My Local Community written 
{by Craig Davies.                      
 My community St. Illtyd's, is a very  
 small hamlet.There are only 25 people 
 there,living in 6 houses.There is 1   
 public house and a caravan.There is   
 also a very old church,built over 700 
 years ago but closed down for safety  
 reasons in 1968.The church,St.Illtyds 
 has been in a state of disrepair since
 and a fund to restore the church was  
 set up by Mr &amp; Mrs Hale.Most houses in
 this area are over 200 years old.     
 I live in an old welsh long house,and 
 over the road is an old welsh cottage,
 ,Castle Cottage,next to this is a     
 smaller cottage,and next to that is   
 the local pub.,The Carpenters Arm's,  
 which was owned by Mr D.Jones but is  
 now owned by Mr&amp;Mrs Joseph Hale from  
 London.Opposite the pub. is a unique  
 modern bungalow,Crad-y-Awel.          </content>
