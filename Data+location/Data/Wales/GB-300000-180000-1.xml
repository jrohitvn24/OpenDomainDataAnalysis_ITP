		<title>01Geology-Llanhari area</title>
		<content>    The area surveyed by our school    
 lies north and east of the village of 
 Llanhari in Mid-Glam.Most of the area 
 is undulating land between 50 and 100m
 above sea level.The lowest lying      
 land is found in the east of the      
 area in the valley of the river Ely,  
 whilst to the north the land rises    
 steeply to 120m on Mynydd Garthmaelwg 
 (269m),part of a south facing scarp   
 formed by the Pennant measures.       
   In the south the area is underlain  
 by Carboniferous limestone which gives
 way northwards to Millstone grit and  
 the coal and shales of the Lower coal 
 series.North of Llanhari village the  
 Carboniferous limestone is overlain by
 Triassic marls and much of the surface
 of the area elsewhere is covered by   
 more recent deposits of boulder clay  
 or alluvium,giving rise to a wide     
 range of soil conditions.             </content>
