		<content>   I have owned Trigger,a 14 year old{ 
{gelding,}for about a year.I keep him  
 at Pentwyn Farm,Bettws and spend hours
 with him every evening.We practise    
 going in and out of sticks in the     
 ground and practise jumping over low  
 fences.                               
  On Saturday I took my pony to compete
 at the{gymkhana}at Grove Park,Malpas  
 run by Magor and District Riding Club.
 The events started at 10.30a.m.and    
 finished at 5.30p.m.There were riders 
 from the Malpas and Bettws area as    
 well as competitors from Magor.I      
 entered 12{races}and won{rosettes}in  
 6 of them.I also won the trophy for   
 being the best in some races.         
   There were about 60{spectators}but  
 there is not much room to watch at    
 Grove Park which is near the motorway 
 and river.
