		<content>{T.V. IN OUR LIVES-}Amazing results    
 were obtained when 10 year-old        
 children calculated their viewing     
 times of T.V.The lowest total for a   
 weeks viewing was 11 hours.The highest
 was 58 hours.The average was 28.6     
 hours.In one year this would total 62 
 days.In 10 years,1 1/2 years viewing. 
 In 60 years this would be about 10    
 years viewing.The boy who watched 58  
 hours a week including breakfast,lunch
 and evening programmes produced even  
 more incredible results.In one year he
 would watch 125 days a year,in 10     
 years about 3 1/2 years and in 60     
 years about 20 1/2 years viewing.     
 Approx. 1/3 of his life was being     
 spent in front of a T.V. set.The      
 results were so frightening he has now
 cut down on this bad habit.
