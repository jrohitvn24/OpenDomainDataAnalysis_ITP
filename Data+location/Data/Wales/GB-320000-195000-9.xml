 Did you have a job?                   
      Yes I did have a paper round     
 every morning and I had 12.5 new pence
 a week.                               
                                       
 Q.What was the average wage for men?  
      The average wage for men in 1945 
 was Â£2.00 (new money) a week.         
                                       
 Q.Where did men and women go out for  
 entertainment?                        
      Cinemas were appearing in        
 1945, every village had one. The film 
 was changed twice a week, Mondays,    
 Tuesdays and Wednesdays and another   
 film on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
 On a Saturday night prices ranged from
 2.5p for front row and 1'6(7.5p) on   
 the balcony.
