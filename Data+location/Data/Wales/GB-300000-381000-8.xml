		<title>08RHYL PROMENADE</title>
		<content>  Rhyl Promenade is long and flat and  
 always has many attractive flowers in 
 gardens and hanging baskets. Along the
 Promenade is the Floral Hall which is 
 going to have aquaria and live        
 butterflies in it. There is an open-  
 air swimming pool which is closed for 
 re-development. The Promenade Bowling 
 Green is used for Crown Green National
 Tournaments and this year's tournament
 will be sponsored by the Midland Bank.
 Further along are putting greens and  
 crazy golf. There is a Cyclorama track
 mainly for B.M.X. bicycles. There are 
 paddling and boating pools and a      
 roller skating rink for children of   
 all ages. Facing the Promenade are    
 amusement arcades and lots of bingo   
 halls. There are hotels, guest houses 
 and flatlets a few minutes walk from  
 the beach. There are also many kiosks,
 cafes and snack bars.                 </content>
