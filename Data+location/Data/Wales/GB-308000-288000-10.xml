		<title>10Before Treowen</title>
		<content>  Before I lived in Treowen I lived in 
 Glasgow.I lived in a high block of    
 flats.Boys used to smash milk bottles 
 in the street.There was a lot of glass
 around.                               
                                       
  I now live in Treowen.I have lived   
 there for four years.Before that I    
 lived in Barmouth.Before Barmouth I   
 I lived in a village in Vietnam.I went
 from there to Hong Kong.I lived in    
 Hong Kong for one year.               
                                       
  The place I now live in is called    
 Treowen estate.Before I lived in      
 Maesydail and before that in Morcambe 
 in a hotel.I can always remember when 
 I had breakfast with the residents the
 waitress said tea or coffee and I     
 always said squash.
