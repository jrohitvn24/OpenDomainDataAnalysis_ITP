		<title>12Attitudes, The Narth</title>
		<content>    A survey of attitudes to village   
 life was carried out among 12         
 villagers of The Narth. It revealed   
 that most of the participants had     
 lived here for 10 years or more.      
 No-one minded newcomers moving into   
 the village, half welcomed it. The    
 village has changed in recent years   
 with the in-filling of plots of land  
 with high quality housing.            
    Most of the people questioned      
 enjoyed attending activities organised
 in the village such as dances, flower 
 arranging, and keep fit classes.      
 Eleven wanted a recreation area and   
 one didn't know. Probably these people
 all had children who could use it. The
 majority believed a cottage industry  
 should be introduced to the area.     
    Suggestions to improve village life
 included the provision of a play area,
 larger shop and more community spirit.</content>
