		<content>  The main religion is Christianity    
 though the Bahai'i faith,the Jehovah's
 Witnesses and Buddhism have made some 
 converts.There are two Anglican       
 churches,one Catholic church,and a    
 number of nonconformist places of     
 worship covering the following denom- 
 inations:United Reformed Church,      
 Baptist,Presbyterian,Society of       
 Friends,and the Evangelicals.The      
 Jehovah's Witnesses have a Kingdom    
 Hall in Howey and there is a Sharma   
 Study Group.A Christian Conference    
 Centre and a Baptist Christian Guest  
 House are also in use.For a small town
 there is considerable religious       
 activity and this is indicative of the
 predominantly middle-aged and aged    
 character of the population.Religious 
 groups which prove most attractive to 
 the young are those with a definite   
 set of beliefs such as the Baptists.  </content>
