 This is a study of a small stream,over
 approximately half a mile of its      
 length,flowing roughly in a           
 North-South direction,but with many   
 twists and turns.On a normal day,the  
 depth varies between 380mm in the     
 deepest part and 20mm over a man made 
 weir.After very heavy rain the stream 
 becomes a dangerous,fast moving       
 torrent,breaking its bank in          
 places,Flowing through many           
 culverts,it enters a man made lake    
 before flowing into the river Rhymney 
 and thence the sea.The lake is popular
 with fishermen and a variety of fish  
 are caught there including            
 tench,perch,carp and rudd.            
 Flora:Plants found in the stream and  
 on the water's edge included a variety
 of rushes,flag iris,bur-reed,lesser   
 duckweed,water lily,starwort,         </content>
