		<title>12TRADE &amp; TOURISM IN LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> Apart from food shops and a newsagent 
 most businesses (eg 3 'antiques'      
 shops) are 'up-market' or geared to   
 the tourist.  The Sub-Post Office is  
 combined with a dispensing chemist and
 Off-Licence.  Some weekly shopping is 
 done in Carmarthen or St Clears.  Fish
 and cockles caught and sold locally   
 and at Milford Haven. Sea-weed is     
 gathered by Land Rover in West Wales  
 and taken to W Glam. to make lava     
 bread.  Farm produce is sold at local 
 marts, milk by tanker to Whitland     
 factory.  Business boosted by large   
 numbers of tourists staying in 1 of 2 
 caravan and chalet parks, touring     
 caravan and tent sites, holiday       
 cottages/flats/guest houses.  Many    
 tour in coach/car and see Dylan       
 Thomas's Boathouse, Castle, Church,   
 beautiful scenery and waterfront and  
 wonderful birdlife.                   </content>
