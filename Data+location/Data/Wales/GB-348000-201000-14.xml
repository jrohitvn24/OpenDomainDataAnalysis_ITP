		<title>14Community Council</title>
		<content> Local government in the UK is divided 
 into three tiers: County, District and
 Community or Parish Councils.  In     
 Wales the first level is called the   
 Community Council.  The area in which 
 we live is covered by the Trellech    
 United Community Council.  There are  
 ll Council members who are elected    
 every four years.  The ward which     
 covers Catbrook is represented by four
 Councillors and also includes  The    
 Narth and part of Trellech itself.    
 The Council meets once a month in full
 session and discusses matters like    
 planning applications, preservation of
 buildings and historical landmarks,   
 the general administration of the area
 and also takes up issues and          
 complaints on behalf of local         
 residents with the larger local       
 authorities.
