		<content> Walking is a very popular activity.   
 Other pastimes include gardening and  
 do-it-yourself activities. The local  
 extra-mural classes run by Bangor     
 University are well-supported. Rowen  
 Village Hall is the venue for many    
 activities such as country dancing    
 classes, snooker, whist drives, bingo 
 sessions, coffee evenings and         
 bring-and-buy sales. There are no     
 purpose-built recreational facilities,
 sports centres or playing fields      
 in this area. The village inn, the    
 Ty Gwyn, is a popular meeting place,  
 especially for the young people and   
 newcomers in the vicinity. Blackburn  
 Education Authority owns Bron-y-Gader 
 on the slopes of Penygadair and use it
 as an outdoor pursuits centre for     
 their school pupils.
