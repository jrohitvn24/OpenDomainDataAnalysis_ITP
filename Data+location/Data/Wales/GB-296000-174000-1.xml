		<content>  The market town of Cowbridge is      
 believed to be built on the site of a 
 Roman Camp. Notable buildings include 
 the 13th century Holy Cross Church,   
 Georgian houses and the Bear Hotel;   
 the latter being an old coaching inn. 
 There are a variety of shops both in  
 the main street and adjacent alleys,  
 as well as a Health Centre, a Library,
 Town Hall, Banks, Building Societies  
 and eight Public Houses. The Old Boys 
 Grammar School with its historic links
 with Jesus College, Oxford, is still  
 in use, although today the locality is
 served by a mixed comprehensive school
 and both English and Welsh speaking   
 primary schools. A marked increase in 
 housing and population has occured    
 during the last 20 years throughout   
 the area. Around Cowbridge with       
 Llanblethian the area is mostly       
 farmland with 4 hamlets and villages. </content>
