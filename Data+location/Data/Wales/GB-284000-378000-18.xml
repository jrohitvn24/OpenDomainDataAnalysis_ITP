		<content>  The Colwyn Bay Sorting Office was    
 built in November 1984 and was opened 
 in the summer of 1985.It cost{Â£162000 
 paid by the Welsh Office.It was built 
 alongside the Post Office because the 
 new Expressway cut 17 ft. off the old 
 sorting office.It has 17 vehicles     
 which cover 4000 miles per week.There 
 are{57 employees}at the office,3 of   
 which are postal executives.The rest  
 are postmen,some only part_time.      
  The post,which consists of letters   
 and parcels,arrives by train at the   
 near-by station.600 bags arrive each  
 week and 170 are despatched.          
  On average{120000}letters arrive in  
 season but only a{quarter}of that     
 amount arrive out of season.          
  The Colwyn Bay Sorting Office has no 
 new technology _ all of the sorting is
 done by hand. Most outgoing mail is   
 sent to Chester for sorting.          </content>
