		<content> In the last few years great efforts   
 have been made to improve the roads in
 our area.At weekends the traffic is   
 very heavy indeed,with many tourists  
 in cars,buses and caravans going into 
 North Wales.We are just on the edge of
 the motorway network.We are only a few
 miles away from the M56 which takes us
 to the M6 motorway and from there we  
 can travel to all parts of Britain.Our
 area has many bus services.We can go  
 to Chester,Liverpool,Manchester       
 and London as well as local buses to  
 Mold,Rhyl,Queensferry and Caernarfon. 
 We have no stations although the main 
 London to Holyhead line cuts our      
 rectangle in half.The nearest station 
 is Shotton,but Chester is only some   
 five miles away.If we need to fly we  
 have Ringway Manchester or Speke at   
 Liverpool.
