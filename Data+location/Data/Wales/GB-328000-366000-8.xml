		<title>08Wepre Hall</title>
		<content>{Wepre Hall}was{rebuilt}in 1770 by a   
 man called{Edward Jones.}They employed
 several servants who wore a           
 distinctive black uniform. Edward     
 Jones died in 1815 and his son Trevor 
 Owen Jones took over. During its' time
 Wepre has had a number of visitors.   
 One a royalist, Edward Morgan stayed  
 at the hall during the civil war.     
 Another royalist who stayed there was 
 Lord Petrie who took refuge after the 
 defeat of the royalists at{Rowton Moor
 in 1645. One of the most famous people
 to stay there was{Charles Kingsley}the
 author of the Water Babies. Local     
 people remember a pets graveyard in   
 the garden, but the gravestones were  
 moved to another pets graveyard in    
{BALA}after a lot were vandalised.     
 Before the hall was knocked down in   
 1966 it was converted into flats for a
 time. {Gillian Lambert.               </content>
