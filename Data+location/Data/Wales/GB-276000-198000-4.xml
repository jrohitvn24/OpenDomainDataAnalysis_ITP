		<title>04   TONNA HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>       The hospital was built in{1939  
 by L.Gower and Sons.Since then,Ward 3 
 has been added.It was first used as an
{Isolation hospital.}Later it was used 
 for children with ear,nose and throat 
 problems.Today it is a geriatric      
 hospital and day centre for the aged. 
 There are only two wards open,each has
 18 people.The hospital has two doctors
 a consultant,a registrar and ten      
 nurses.The visiting times are         
 unrestricted.                         
              There are plans to change
 the hospital tremendously in the      
 future as they hope to convert the    
 wards into family units where people  
 can be more relaxed and feel at home. 
        The patients usually stay for 6
 to 8 weeks,but some just come for a   
 very short time to give their family a
 break.The oldest patient is 98.
