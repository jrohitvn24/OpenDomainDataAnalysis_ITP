		<title>08FARMING IN GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> The farms are small farms of between  
 90 and 300 acres. Most farmers keep   
 sheep and cattle. Some farmers grow   
 potatoes, swedes, and barley. A lot of
 the farms are made of two or more     
 smaller farms. Most farms have grazing
 rights on the hills. In Spring there  
 is lambing. In June there is silage   
 and shearing. In July there is hill   
 gathering. Then the sheep are dipped  
 to keep off scab. In July and August  
 there is hay-making. There are quite a
 lot of changes. Old fields have been  
 ploughed and new sorts of grass       
 planted. A lot of open hills have been
 ploughed to get rid of bracken. More  
 people are making silage in big bags  
 because it better for the sheep. There
 are lots of big new buildings so that 
 more sheep can be kept under cover in 
 winter. There are many new farm roads 
 up to the hills.                      </content>
