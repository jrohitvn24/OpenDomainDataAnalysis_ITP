		<title>13TEACHERS STRIKES</title>
		<content>    My name is Amanda Williams and I   
 live in the village of{Bishopston.}I  
 go to{Bishopston Comprehensive School}
 but my friends and I have a lot of    
 time off school lately because of     
 teachers' strikes. I am 15 and in the 
 final year at{Bishopston.}When I leave
 school I hope to go to study art. We  
 live in a world of {videos}and{laser- 
{beams, hifis}and{space shuttles.}I am 
 not looking forward to my O-levels in 
 the summer, I blame it all on the     
 teachers!                             
   {Bishopston}has become quite a built
 up area in the last few years,        
 although there are not many places    
 where people around my age group are  
 able to go out and enjoy ourselves. We
 hear a lot ofmurder in the news and it
 is very rarely that we hear any good  
 news. It is all war and murder.
