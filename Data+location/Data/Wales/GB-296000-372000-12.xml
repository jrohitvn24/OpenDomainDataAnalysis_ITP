		<content> A local resident who retired into the 
 area from England has seen several    
 cottages disappear into ruins because 
 the land has been joined together to  
 make larger farm units.  Several      
 houses were used as holiday cottages  
 but in the last 5 years this has been 
 halted and now the trend is for empty 
 cottages to be bought, rebuilt or     
 renovated by local people who live in 
 them all the year round.  He thinks   
 that the farming industry would in the
 future level out and that the effect  
 of the E.E.C. would mean that farmers 
 would have to alter their pattern of  
 farming.  We have probably seen the   
 end of the Golden Age of farming and  
 the bigger the better argument would  
 have to be replaced by a return to    
 working the land as the demand        
 dictated.                             
                                       </content>
