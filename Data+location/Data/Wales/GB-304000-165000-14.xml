		<title>14HOUSING IN RHOOSE</title>
		<content> As mentioned on page 13 the housing in
 the older part of Rhoose is pre       
 W.W.II. Since about 1960 a large      
 amount of development has taken place 
 with well-known building companies    
 like {BARRATT and WESTBURY and WIMPEY 
 building large estates on sites which 
 were predominantly agricultural. These
 new estates are positioned to the     
 North of the village with the bulk of 
 them being built at the Western end of
 the village. The position of          
 Cardiff Wales Airport makes           
 development of desirable              
 residential areas difficult at        
 the North Eastern edge of the         
 village. It is an important           
 feature of most of the new            
 housing that windows facing the       
 airport runway have usually been      
 double-glazed to provide adequate     
 sound insulation.                     </content>
