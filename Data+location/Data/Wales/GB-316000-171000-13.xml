		<title>13The Seafront  Penarth.</title>
		<content> The seafront's most popular feature is
 the pier, from which it is possible to
 enjoy views across the Bristol Channel
 as well as the islands of{Steepholm}  
 and{Flatholm.}During the summer months
 there are regular steamer trips aboard
 the Waverley to Ilfracombe or Lundy   
 Island. Sailing,fishing and water ski-
 ing are favourite pastimes for many   
 people. Others prefer to stroll along 
 the Esplanade, which backs the pebble 
 beach, and extends from the amusement 
 arcare to the Yacht Club. The Italian 
 Gardens, a sheltered suntrap facing   
 the Esplanade, are attractive with    
 their palm trees and flowerbeds. Along
 the front there are several well know 
 resturants, the old Public Baths which
 have recently been closed and the     
 ruin of the once grand Esplanade Hotel
 destroyed by fire some years ago which
 is soon to be demolished.             </content>
