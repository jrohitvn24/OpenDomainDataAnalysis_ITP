		<title>19LLANWERN STEELWORKS,NEWPORT</title>
		<content>      Llanwern steel works were built  
 by Richard,Thomas and Baldwin (RTB),  
 but was nationalised by the Labour    
 Government to join the BSC group.     
                                       
      When Llanwern was in full        
 production in the 1970's it had the   
 largest steel output in Europe.       
                                       
      There has been a large reduction 
 in the number of people employed in   
 Llanwern. This has affected the job   
 prospects of young people in this     
 area.                                 
                                       
      Llanwern's future is in the      
 balance, because the EEC is           
 pressurising for a cut in steel       
 production in the United Kingdom. The 
 workforce has fought this and the     
 plant has become profitable after     
 making huge losses in the past.       </content>
