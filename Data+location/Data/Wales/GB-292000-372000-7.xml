		<content>   The sheep are{sheared}at the        
 beginning of June and the wool sold   
 through the{British Wool Marketing    
{Board.                                
   The lambs are sold at eight months  
 and are used either as breeding       
 animals on other farms or are fattened
 for meat.                             
   The sheep have to be{dipped}to kill 
 flies and other pests that breed in   
 the fleece. This usually takes place a
 few weeks after shearing in July using
 a long concrete bath which contains   
 the sheep-dip, into which the sheep   
 are herded and submerged.             
   In recent years the farm has        
 fattened more lambs{on the farm}by    
 producing more fodder crops, hay and  
 silage so that animals can be kept    
 through the winter. The fattened lambs
 are then sold direct to butchers when 
 they weigh 17 kgs each.               </content>
