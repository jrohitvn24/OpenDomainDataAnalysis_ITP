		<content>       Fireball                        
           At least six girls form a   
 circle. A ball is passed around.When  
 someone drops it they get the ball and
 throw it to the person next to them,  
 then they have to try and run round   
 the outside of the circle and get back
 to their place as the ball is passed  
 from one girl to the next. If the ball
 reaches the space first,the girl is   
 out.If the girl gets back first the   
 game begins again.If someone is out   
 she sits in the middle and sucks her  
 thumb until someone else is out.      
       Skipping Rhyme                  
           One of our favourite        
 skipping games is 'Drip Drop'         
   Drip drop,drop it in the sea.       
   Please pull the rope for me.        
   Are you coming?

   No No the fair's not there!         </content>
