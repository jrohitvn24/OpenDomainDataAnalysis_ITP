		<title>06HAMLET, MWYNDY CROSS</title>
		<content>{LANDSCAPE:}On a low hill overlooking  
 the river Clun Valley, 1 mile         
 southeast of Talbot Green.{           
{POSITION: It is on the}crossroads of  
 the Llantrisant to Cardiff and Miskin 
 to Cross Inn routes.                  
{HISTORY: }Provided minerals and stone,
 served by a spur of railway line, now 
 abandoned. Today, replaced by a coal  
 processing plant with much pollution, 
 explosives storage and one or two     
 minor industries. Nearby are two      
 petrol filling stations, and a Heavy  
 Goods Vehicle Testing Station.        
{PROBLEMS:}The hamlet is dispersing    
 because the new Cardiff Rd. built in  
 the cutting has separated the village 
 in two and it is now a hazardous      
 crossing point from Miskin. New       
 development is difficult owing to     
 present planning and zoning           
 restrictions.                         </content>
