		<content>      The majority of the families     
 living in our area have done so for   
 twenty years or more.Most families    
 consist of 2 or 3 people with         
 the occasional large family of 5 or 6.
 Most own a colour T.V,a hi-fi and at  
 least one car.                        
      Nearly all the families shop in  
 the local shops or town center, which 
 they find inadequate. The feeling is  
 that a greater variety of shops is    
 needed.                               
      The most popular past-time is    
 sport,including squash,canoing and of 
 course the national game,rugby. The   
 younger element being the participants
 and the older element the spectators. 
      The survey showed that while some
 people smoked many had either given up
 or were in the process of giving up.
