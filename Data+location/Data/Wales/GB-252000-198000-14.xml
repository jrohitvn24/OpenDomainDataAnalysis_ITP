{ELDERLY COUPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN THE  
{AREA FOR 80 YEARS:                    
  The couple interviewed had witnessed 
 phenomenal changes in the area during 
 their lifetime.They believe one of the
 major changes has been transport-they 
 remember trams and trolley buses where
 there are now busy main roads with    
 three lanes of heavy traffic          
 School was different:they had the cane
 if they were late and there were no   
 school dinners;they left school at the
 age of thirteen.                      
 Shops were mainly corner shops but    
 "Lipton's" was popular for buying     
 food-just like today.                 
 There was no T.V. so they amused      
 themselves by playing games and       
 listening to the radio.               
 The couple prefer life today because  
 the standard of life is higher.       </content>
