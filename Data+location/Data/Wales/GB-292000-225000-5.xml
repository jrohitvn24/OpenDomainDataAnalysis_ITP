		<title>05GOINGS ON IN DEFYNNOG</title>
		<content>  This is about some of the things that
 go on in Defynnog.                    
  In farming the people keep animals   
 like cows and have lots of land. At   
 night some people like to go to       
 have a drink and to enjoy themselves  
 in the Tanners Arms or the Lion; the  
 Lion is about eight hundred years old.
  Also in Defynnog there is a forge and
 a smithy which are run by brothers;   
 Paul Denis and Ian Denis.             
  There is also a brass rubbing centre,
 which we visited last week. Daddy some
 times goes to the antiques place in   
 Defynnog, he is looking for a big pine
 table. There is also a little post    
 office that shares the old court house
 and police station with the brass     
 rubbing centre. In my opinion Defynnog
 is a nice place to live.
