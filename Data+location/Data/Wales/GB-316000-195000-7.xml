		<content>      Used to be flat before Ice Age.  
 Water and glaciers have cut valleys in
 southerly direction.                  
      Mainly deciduous woodland but    
 much cut down for farming, building   
 and smelting. Tops of mountain        
 grassland, poor grazing. Housing in   
 area mainly terraced but developments 
 on estates at Penllwyn, The Bryn,     
 Springfield, Grove Park, Cefn Fforest.
      Large number of people           
 interviewed liked the area because of 
 its proximity to shops and amenities, 
 yet the area is still small enough to 
 be 'friendly'. There is concern about 
 vandalism and the amount of litter. It
 is a popular area as it is close to   
 jobs and good roads like the M4 and   
 the Heads of the Valleys Road.
