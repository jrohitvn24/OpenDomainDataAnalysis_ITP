		<content>   This hilly area lies a short        
 distance inland from the North Wales  
 coast between the Market Town of      
 Abergele in the North and the Valley  
 of the River Elwy to the South. The   
 whole area is farmland except for a   
 few small areas of woodland. There are
{no towns or villages}in the area but  
 a number of scattered farmhouses and  
 cottages.{Amenities}in the area are   
 consequentley very few, with the      
 people visiting the nearby coastal    
 towns for most of their requirements. 
   An investigation into the shopping  
 habits of the people in this area     
 revealed the following pattern:       
   For groceries, meat, fruit and      
 vegetables, almost all the people in  
 the area (97%) shopped in Abergele,   
 Rhyl and the Asda supermarket in      
 Kinmel Bay.
