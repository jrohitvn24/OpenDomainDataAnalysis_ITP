		<content>  Haberdashers' Monmouth School for    
Girls is a public school,founded in    
1891 as a result of the enlargement of 
a trust created by William Jones,a     
merchant.He left certain property to   
the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers,
of which he became a liveryman in 1600.
  The school caters for about 600      
pupils between the ages of 7 and 18.   
With over 50  members of staff,the     
school can boast of a far lower        
pupil/teacher ratio than state schools.
  Religious principles are seen as an  
important element in the building of   
character and every girl is expected to
attend a church service on Sundays.    
  The school provides a wide range of  
subjects and activities for the 1518   
pounds per annum charged.Although most 
of these can be found in other schools,
the school has a fine tradition in the 
unusual sport of lacrosse.             </content>
