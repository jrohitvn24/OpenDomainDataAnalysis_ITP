		<content> The rundown of public transport over  
 recent years is of great concern. Many
 people have solved this by their own  
 form of transport, but for those who  
 cannot afford this or cannot drive,   
 life can be difficult, especially for 
 the elderly and young people. Although
 the survey statistics show 7 buses    
 running all year round, only one of   
 these is a daily service, running from
 Llanrwst to Llandudno through Trefriw 
 hourly. The other buses run to        
 Llanrwst only on market or Fair day ie
 once a week from outlying districts.  
 School children have their own        
 services and where only a few children
 live in an isolated area, a taxi      
 service is used. Fares, though        
 subsidised, are high, and visits to   
 the doctor, dentist and chiropodist   
 are made expensive for old people for 
 whom there are no concessionary fares.</content>
