		<content> Originally the police station was in  
 Llanfair Road but in the mid 1950's   
 the present section station coming    
 under Colwyn Bay was built.  There are
 24 policemen and 2 policewomen        
 operating from this base covering     
 Abergele, Pensarn, Towyn (which also  
 has its own small station) and local  
 villages.  There are 4 rotas covering 
 a 3 shift system with 5 uniformed     
 officers and 2 CID officers on duty.  
 The most senior officer is the        
 sergeant.  In 1984 there were 1,500   
 crimes committed in the area.  The    
 detection rate is 40/45%.  The busiest
 period is July/August holiday period. 
 There is one CID vehicle and three    
 general service vehicles. Two cells   
 adjoin the magistrates court where    
 local cases are heard and terms of    
 imprisonment up to 6 months can be    
 enforced.                             </content>
