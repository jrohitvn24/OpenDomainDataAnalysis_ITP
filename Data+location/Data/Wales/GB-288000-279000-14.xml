		<content>  There is no real social life in the  
 village. There seems to be those who  
 enjoy a drink, and those who do not.  
 There is no choice for young people - 
 no youth club, no societies, other    
 than the Y.F.C.                       
  Discos are held in Llanidloes. The   
 nearest theatre is in Newtown.        
  Some local people are involved in    
 singing in choirs in Rhayader. Some   
 are concert soloists. The majority of 
 the inhabitants are musical, but do   
 little about it.                      
  Clothes fashions are very reserved   
 even among the young.                 
  Very few people gamble, but there is 
 a betting shop in Llanidloes.         
  Generally life is quiet and          
 unaffected by national cultural       
 trends. There are no coloured people.
