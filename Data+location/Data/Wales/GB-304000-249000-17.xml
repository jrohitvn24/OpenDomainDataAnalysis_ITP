		<title>17RIVER WYE AND WYE BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The River Wye rises in the Plynlimon  
 Range and runs into the sea in the    
 Bristol Channel.It passes through     
 Builth where it is joined by the      
 Irfon.There are two bridges in Builth,
 one over the Wye and one over the     
 Irfon.There used to be a ford through 
 the Wye at Builth before a bridge was 
 built.The present bridge is built of  
 local stone but there was an earlier  
 wooden bridge. The community of Builth
 developed because of this crossing    
 place. The river used to flood badly, 
 but things have improved since a flood
 prevention scheme was introduced.It is
 a very clean river and we try to keep 
 it that way.The river is famous       
 throughout England and Wales for its  
 salmon and trout and many fishermen   
 visit its banks every year.Canoeists  
 are also very fond of the Wye.
