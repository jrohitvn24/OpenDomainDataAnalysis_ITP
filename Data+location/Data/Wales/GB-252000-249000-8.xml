		<content> On Saturday I play outside if it's    
 not raining .I play with our rabbit   
 and I climb trees.My mum usually      
 does the shopping on Friday after her 
 work. When it's raining I usually     
 draw pictures or read books .Last     
 Saturday we went to Aberystwyth to    
 get some sandals .We looked in lots of
 shops but in the end we found some.In 
 the morning I get up and dress,go down
 and have breakfast.After breakfast I  
 go to feed our rabbit.I give him      
 grass,lettuce,bread and fresh water   
 to drink.After that I draw if it's    
 raining and stay outside if it        
 isn't.I'm not usually allowed inside  
 if it's nice weather because my mum   
 and dad want to clean the house.at two
 o'clock I have lunch because the      
 cleaning takes so long.After lunch I  
 am allowed to go in.Sometimes we go   
 for a trip.Then I have my tea.        </content>
