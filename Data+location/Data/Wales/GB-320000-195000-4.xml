 Q.What was transport like?            
      There was a railway,a canal,horse
 and carts,and a few Charabancs,but    
 most people used to walk.             
 Q.What about the social life?         
      Families were very close_knit    
 and very religious.Most families      
 attended chapels or churches regularly
 on Sundays.It was common practice for 
 mothers to pawn their best clothes on 
 Monday  and redeem them again on      
 Saturday to wear them the next day for
 chapel or church.Parents took         
 their children on walks in the area on
 picnic outings.The evening life       
 consisted of entertainment within the 
 home.Men would go out to drink but    
 women were not allowed in Public      
 houses.                               </content>
