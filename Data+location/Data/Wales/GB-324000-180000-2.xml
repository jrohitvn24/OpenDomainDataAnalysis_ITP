		<title>02A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> On a school day most of us have the   
 same routine.When we wake up,we get   
 up ,get washed and dressed and have   
 breakfast.Some of us have bacon and   
 eggs or cereal and toast for          
 breakfast.                            
     School begins at 9.25am and we    
 all   have  different ways of getting 
 to school. Some of us travel by bus or
 car;some of us cycle and some of us   
 live close enough to walk to school.  
     During our time in school we      
 do maths,writing,crafts,reading,      
 games,P.E.,singing and have stories.We
 have one hour for lunch as none of us 
 lives close enough to go home in the  
 hour.                                 
     School ends at 3.25pm,when we go  
 home for tea.Some of our dads finish  
 work and come home by about 6pm.We    
 play outdoors or watch television.By  
 8pm most of us are in bed.            </content>
