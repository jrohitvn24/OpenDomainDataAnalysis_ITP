		<title>17TONMAWR - SOCIAL TENSIONS</title>
		<content> A degree of tension exists between the
 two communities that make up the      
 village: when the community centre was
 first proposed about 5 or 6 years ago,
 each community insisted that it should
 belong to that particular community in
 name and location, if nothng else. To 
 get everyone's support for the scheme 
 the organisers hit on a neutral name  
 'PELENNA' - named after the river, and
 a location near the school, \ way     
 between the two communities.          
 Jealousies were rekindled however,    
 when Prince Charles opened the Centre.
 Quarrels caused during the debate     
 about who should meet the Prince still
 smoulder on. Signs that the two       
 communities are beginning to work     
 better together can be seen in groups 
 like the school's PTA and in the      
 groups organising summer play schemes 
 for children.                         </content>
