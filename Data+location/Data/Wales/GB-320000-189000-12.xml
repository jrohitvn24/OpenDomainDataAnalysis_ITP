		<title>12Blackvein Pit Disaster</title>
		<content>  On the 1st. of November 1860, there  
 was a violent explosion at the        
 Blackvein Colliery, Risca, and 142 men
 and boys, 20 of them under 15 years of
 age, were killed. The bodies were     
 later recovered; some were burnt and  
 charred, while others were those of   
 people who had died of asphyxiation.  
 Many of them were buried in a small   
 cemetery, made especially for the     
 purpose, in the middle of a field on  
 the opposite side of the valley to the
 pit, adjacent to the canal and near   
 what used to be the Greenmeadow Inn.  
 The cemetery, enclosed by a very      
 small brick wall, stands neglected in 
 the field, with nothing to mark it    
 since all the headstones have been    
 taken away over the years.            
 The last headstone, carved in Welsh,  
 marks the grave of a man and his 10   
 year old son, both killed in the mine.</content>
