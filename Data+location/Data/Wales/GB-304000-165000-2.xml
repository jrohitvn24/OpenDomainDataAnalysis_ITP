		<title>02TRANSPORT SYSTEMS IN RHOOSE</title>
		<content> Rhoose is bounded on its Northern side
 by a relatively new by-pass (opened in
 the mid-70's).Prior to this the       
 village was served by the {B4265}.    
 This road passes through the length of
 the village and used to carry a large 
 amount of heavy traffic heading for   
 the Aberthaw Cement Works, RAF St     
 Athan or the Power Stations at East   
 Aberthaw.Such traffic is now banned   
 from the village and has resulted in a
 change of atmosphere along the length 
 of what is known as {Fontygary Road.} 
 To the{Southern and coastal}side      
 Rhoose lies a railway track which     
 serves as a goods line except on      
 Sundays when the Paddington - Swansea 
 train uses this stretch of track      
 through the Vale of Glamorgan to allow
 maintenance work to be carried out on 
 the main line.              (cont.)
