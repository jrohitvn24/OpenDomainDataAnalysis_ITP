		<content> Last Saturday 8th June,1985,I walked  
 ten miles in a sponsored walk.We are  
 collecting money for the National     
 Eisteddfod of Wales in Fishguard in   
 1986.We have to collect Â£600.Last     
 year before Christmas we had a coffee 
 evening and we raised Â£200.There were 
 nine people walking.Their names were  
 Mr.and Mrs.Thomas,my mother,Vera      
 Richards and I,Gill Davies,her friend 
 Mary White,Robina Elis-Gruffydd,Angela
 Williams and Cliff Salmon and his dog 
 Hannah.I was the only child           
 walking.When we had walked nearly five
 miles the people behind us saw a fox  
 running across the road.I would have  
 liked to see the fox.I found a pound  
 note and I was really happy.All the   
 other children rode ten miles.They had
 to cycle round the block from         
 Bwlch-y-groes to Clun and Waunlwyd    
 four times.                           </content>
