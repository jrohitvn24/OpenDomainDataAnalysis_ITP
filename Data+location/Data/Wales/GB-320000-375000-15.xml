		<content> Most of the local inhabitants live in 
 council owned houses.There are  6     
 large council estates in the area.    
 Recently quite a few people living in 
 council houses have bought their      
 houses from the council.The privately 
 owned houses are more spread out as   
 opposed to being on estates.Most of   
 the council houses are 3 bedroomed    
 semi-detached.Quite a few of the      
 privately owned terrace houses used   
 to be owned by the lead works and     
 collieries.10/12 years ago,some       
 council tenants had to be rehoused in 
 other local council houses due to land
 subsidence.Riverbank estate was built 
 between 1926-1938.Bron Haul estate was
 built between 1958-1960.Bron y Wern   
 was built between 1949-1954.Wern Uchaf
 was built between 1953-1958.Highfield 
 Road was built in 1973.There are quite
 a few old age people's bungalows.     </content>
