    The fair is an annual event and    
 because of an old charter in the town 
 it is always there on May 19th.It is a
 place to go where you can enjoy       
 yourself,and meet people you don't see
 very often.It is very expensive and   
 some people think it is a waste of    
 money.Rides on the fair used to be    
 very reasonable a few years ago.There 
 are all sorts of rides.For little     
 children there are rides like the     
 aeroplane,and for the older ones the  
 bumper cars,the cyclone, twist, the   
 cage and the scream machine.There are 
 lots of  side shows and games         
 too.You can win prizes on the side    
 shows but they are not very good. It  
 is lovely to have a hotdog or toffee  
 apple or even chips to go home with.
