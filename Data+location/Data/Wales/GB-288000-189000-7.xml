		<title>07Unemployment in Pontycymer</title>
		<content> The decline of the industry was       
 accompanied by pit closure and        
 unemployment.                         
  In 1928, 71.7% of the Garw work force
 was unemployed, in 1938 66.7% .       
  Today unemployment is still very high
 . 80% of school leavers are on the    
 dole  and unemployment is twice the   
 national average.                     
  With unemployment, local shopkeepers 
 have suffered, and dering the recent  
 strike, shops were forced to close    
 early on saturdays because of lack of 
 trade.                                
  The only 3 large employers in        
 Pontycymer are the two factories,     
 Rexel and Flextank, and the one       
 remaining colliery, the Garw. However,
 these only employ about 15% of the    
 workforce, so large numbers of people 
 are forced to commute to Bridgend,    
 Cardiff and even further afield.      </content>
