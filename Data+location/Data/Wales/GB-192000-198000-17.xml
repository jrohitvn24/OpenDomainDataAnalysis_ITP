		<title>17HIGHGATE INN HUNDLETON</title>
		<content> The Inn owned by Mr. and Mrs. Michael 
 Williams. It is five years old (in    
 1985) and caters mainly for local     
 people and summer visitors. It employs
 eight staff. There are about one      
 hundred customers a night, and the Inn
 can cater for one hundred and seventy.
 July, August and December are the     
 busiest months, January, Febuary and  
 March are not very good. There is live
 music, with the occasional "disco" -  
 dancing to records. There is a        
 juke-box, arcade games and darts. The 
 inn is the centre for the local       
 community's social life, and offers a 
 range of food and drink, also to the  
 summer visitors. Before becoming the  
 'Highgate Inn' the building was a very
 old four bedroomed house called 'New  
 House'.
