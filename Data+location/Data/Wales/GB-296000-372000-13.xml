		<content> A 16 year old looks to the future.    
 He has just taken his 'O' levels and  
 has gone back to school to the Sixth  
 Form.  He is interested in farming and
 works at a local farm at week ends.   
 He would like to be a farmer owning   
 his own farm.  He does not think this 
 is a probability as he will not be    
 able to afford land and animals and   
 equipment, so he has to decide on     
 another career.  He will go in for    
 science and accepts that to get a job 
 in this field he will have to leave   
 the area and this saddens him.  He is 
 of Welsh parentage and has been born  
 and bred in the area and attends a    
 Welsh medium secondary school and     
 speaks Welsh fluently.  He would like 
 to live in the area when an adult.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
