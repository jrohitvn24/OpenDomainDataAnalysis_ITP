		<title>03PLAS GWILYM QUARRY</title>
		<content> The Plas Gwilym quarry opened in 1885 
 to provide stone for the sea wall in  
 Colwyn Bay.Six acres of land are owned
 by the quarry,but only one acre is    
 quarried.Once,they had to excavate to 
 get under a road to quarry new land   
 and this took eight months.The stone  
 they quarry is limestone and they use 
 low explosives to break the rock.They 
 use a diamond circular saw to cut the 
 stone.This gives the stone a square   
 face.This stone was used in the       
 building of Conway bridge and the new 
 expressway.The greatest demand for    
 stone is March to June.October to     
 November is a less demanding period.  
 The men start work at 6.30a.m.on most 
 days but when something special is    
 needed they work in two shifts, night 
 and day.
