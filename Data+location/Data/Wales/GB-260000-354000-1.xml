		<title>01The Snowdon Massif</title>
		<content> This area covers the summit of        
 Snowdon, 1085 metres above sea level, 
 and the ridges which meet at this     
 point. In the north west the land     
 drops steeply to the Llanberis Pass   
 only 208 metres above sea level; and  
 in the south west to Llyn Llydaw; an  
 in hospitable mountain lake. Over     
 400,000 people walk on the paths which
 lead to the summit each year and these
 are becoming badly eroded. National   
 Park Wardens &amp; volunteers are trying  
 to allay the situation. Day trippers  
 use the mountain railway to ride to   
 the summit from Spring until Autumn.  
 Most of this area however has only    
 visits by rock climbers, feral goats  
 and peregrine falcons since the rock  
 faces and gulleys deter the majority.
