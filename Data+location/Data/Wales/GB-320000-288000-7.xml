		<title>07Sarn Chapel</title>
		<content> The Chapel in Sarn is above the pub.It
 will seat about 100 people.There is an
{organ.}We do not have a proper        
 minister,but we have different{       
{ministers}to take the service every   
 week.Mostly there are only about      
 fifteen people who go.Every Sunday    
 morning, the service is at 10.30 until
 11.30 and the one at night is at 6.30 
 until 7.30.During the morning service 
 the children go out into the          
 school-room, where Miss Evans tells   
 them a story or we have a quiz.The    
 school-room is joined on to the side  
 of the chapel.We have to go down four 
 or five steps to get into the         
 school-room.The chapel was built in   
 1887 and the school-room was built in 
 1938.
