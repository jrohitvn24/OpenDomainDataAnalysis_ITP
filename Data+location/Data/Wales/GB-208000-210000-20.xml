		<title>20TEMPLETON'S HISTORIC  SITES.</title>
		<content>  In the 14th Century Templeton was    
 known as Templars' Tun.The Knights    
 Templar had a hunting lodge in the    
 area.St.John's Church is built on the 
 site of the Knights Templars' hospice.
    There is an ancient earthwork at   
 Molleston Back.The original Narberth  
 Castle was built by the Normans at    
 Sentence field,which is sometimes     
 known as "Castles".The earthen Motte  
 still remains,surrounded by trees.    
    The name "Sentence"and the area    
 known as " King's Park" probably date 
 back to the Civil War.Trees were grown
 for use by the Navy on Narberth       
 Mountain in the 17th Century.The name 
 of Wood Office is derived from this.  
    There are many long narrow fields  
 in Templeton dating back to the strip 
 system in Saxon times.                
  Templeton's derelict airfield was    
 built during World War II.            </content>
