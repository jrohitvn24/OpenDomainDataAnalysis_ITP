		<title>08LAW and ORDER in RHAYADER</title>
		<content> The Police Station in Rhayader has 2  
 cells for offenders and is only manned
 for 1.5 hours per week on Mondays,    
 Wednesdays and Fridays,i.e.1/2hours   
 each day.At all other times           
 Llandrindod Wells (12miles away) has  
 to be contacted for help.There are 3  
 Policemen and 1 Police Special.       
  The Magistrates' Court "sits" on the 
 first Wednesday of every month with 6 
 magistrates.They deal with minor      
 offences and pub and club licences.All
 the more serious cases go to the Crown
 Court in Welshpool.                   
  In contrast to the more urban areas  
 the local policemen are known and     
 accepted as ordinary members of the   
 community.                            
  There is very little crime of any    
 sort in the area neither is there any 
 noticeable amount of vandalism.
