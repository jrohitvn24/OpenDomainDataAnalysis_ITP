		<title>04Events the Carnival</title>
		<content>  Weeks before the carnival the        
 organizers are busy writing away in   
 books thinking about what to do.A day 
 before the carnival all the lorries   
 are waiting gathered in a car park.On 
 route there are decorations,bunting   
 hanging over the lamposts.Some people 
 dress up as pirates and some dress up 
 as clowns.                            
  All the barriers are up and          
 ready,Children get on the floats and  
 we all get started.The first lorry    
 goes and then a couple of minutes     
 later another one goes.On route       
 mothers and fathers take thousands of 
 pictures to put in their albums.There 
 are hot dog and ice cream vans.       
  When it is all over people take down 
 the barriers and a lot or litter is   
 left to blow away."Next year,"the     
 organizers keep muttering"We'll plan  
 a way to control the litter."         </content>
