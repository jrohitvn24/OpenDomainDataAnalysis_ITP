		<title>05A TYPICAL SATURDAY</title>
		<content> I usually get up at 7.30a.m.on        
 Saturdays.Iwash and change,and have my
 breakfast(usually cereal but sometimes
 toast and jam or sausage and          
 egg).I watch breakfast television and 
 play with my toys.At about 9.30a.m. I 
 get ready to walk up with my mother or
 father to Holywell.It takes about 15  
 minutes to walk up.The swimming pool  
 opens at 10a.m.I go swimming while my 
 mother does the weekend               
 shopping.Sometimes I go up on the     
 bus,the bus fare for children is      
 24p,for adults it is 32p.It costs 27p 
 to go swimming.You can stay in the    
 water as long as you like.I usually   
 stay for 3 hours.I take sandwiches to 
 eat in the park.The park is next to   
 the swimming pool.Sometimes I go to   
 town and buy a bag of chips.I met my  
 mother in town and we walk home.
