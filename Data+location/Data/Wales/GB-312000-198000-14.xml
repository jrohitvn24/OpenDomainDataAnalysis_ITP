 Today I got up at a quarter to eight  
 to face a bright sunny morning. I     
 washed, dressed, plaited my hair and  
 put my sandwiches in my bag. I ate    
 breakfast with the rest of the family 
 and watched T.V. a.m. before going to 
 school. In our morning service Mr.    
 Williams told us a story and then we  
 went back to our classroom to work. We
 did Maths  until playtime. Last week  
 in playtimes we played skipping, this 
 week it is tennis. After we went back 
 to our class for English and Reading. 
 We ate our sandwiches during lunchtime
 and played in the yard. Then we did   
 some topic work and after play Mr.    
 Rees took us to practise Athletics.   
 It was then time to go home for tea   
 and to watch television until 5.15 pm.
 After playing outside for a while, I  
 had my supper and got ready for bed.  </content>
