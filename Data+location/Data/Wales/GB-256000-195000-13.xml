		<content> Facilities for leisure in the Loughor 
 area are provided in the main by      
 Penyrheol Leisure Centre,and by the   
 Swansea Recreation Centre.However     
 there is a local park with a well     
 tended attractive flower garden,open  
 fields,two soccer pitches,tennis      
 courts,paddling pool for toddlers,a   
 playground and a bandstand.The whole  
 area is surrounded by trees and is an 
 attractive foil to the castle         
 remains,the church and Loughor bridge.
      This park was provided for       
 Loughor by the descendants of John    
 Williams,once a native of Loughor who 
 in the hard times of the industrial   
 slump went to America to make his     
 fortune.He founded the huge Weirton   
 steelworks,many of whose employees are
 related to the first Welsh exiles.He  
 also founded a scholarship for Loughor
 scholars to study in America annually.</content>
