		<content> Considering that the communities      
 within the block are rural the block  
 is served by a reasonable transport   
 service.                              
 History shows us that over the years  
 transport in our area has             
 deteriorated.  Until quite recently   
 the communities were served by a      
 flourishing rail network.  With       
 stations at both Garnant and          
 Brynamman.  Today there is no rail    
 service left within the block.  In the
 past 12 months the bus services within
 the block have been drastically cut.  
 Services to Ammanford and Swansea (the
 nearest large shopping centres) have  
 been cut by half.  Many old and infirm
 people are hindered from travelling to
 these towns by the need to change     
 buses at a central meeting point, many
 buses traveling only as far as        
 Pontardawe or Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen.       </content>
