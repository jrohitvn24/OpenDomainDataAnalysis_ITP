		<title>10A WEEKEND IN WELSHPOOL</title>
		<content> It is 09.45 on saturday July 6th and I
 am dressed in old clothes ready for   
 cleaning out my rabbits, which live in
 a shed in the back garden of our      
 public house in Welshpool.{I am 12    
{years old}and one of a family of      
 seven (slightly more than average!).  
 Every saturday I get up at about 08.00
 and after breakfast go and clean out  
 my rabbits. From about 11.00 I do some
 reading, homework and watch television
 until lunchtime at 13.30. The rest of 
 the afternoon I spend relaxing,       
 possibly going for a walk, or to the  
 seaside in the summer. Saturday       
 evenings are mainly spent watching    
 television, listening to records or   
 doing homework. I have tea at 19.00   
 and go to bed at about 22.00.         
{Sunday is usually a very quiet day}as 
 I go to Sunday School between 11.00   
 and 1200 and then just lounge around. </content>
