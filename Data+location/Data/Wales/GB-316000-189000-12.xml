		<content>  Law and order in our area is         
 maintained by our local policeman ,who
 is a member of the Gwent Constabulary.
 He is the village Bobby.His duty area 
 covers the whole of Cwmfelinfach and  
 Ynysddu and the mountainsides around  
 them including fifteen farms. The     
 police station is situated in the main
 street of Cwmfelin,it is only a       
 village station manned for a few      
 hours a day by P.C.Thomas.Each day he 
 is on duty he must report to his      
 headquarters at Blackwood 3km. away.  
    P.C.Thomas patrols the village on a
 cycle and also on foot.His daily      
 rounds involve taking statements,     
 checking all the buildings for signs  
 of vandalism or break in.He is often  
 approached by people who tell him any 
 problems they might have.The most     
 recent serious case he has been       
 involved with was a fatal car crash.  </content>
