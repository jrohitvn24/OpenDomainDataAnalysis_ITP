    There are two main areas, those    
 earning their living working on       
 the farms, or in small industries     
 connected with farming, producing     
 slurry machines or working at         
 Llandynog creamery,and those who      
 commute to work in the towns of       
 Ruthin, Denbigh, Mold and the City of 
 Liverpool.                            
   LANGUAGE.                           
    The area is equally divided between
 those speaking Welsh, and the English 
 speaking section.                     
   RELIGION.                           
    There is one church in the area at 
 Llangynhafal, where the vicar is in   
 charge of three parishes, with regular
 services, well attended. There is no  
 chapel, but roughly half the          
 population of the area attend the     
 Welsh chapel at Llandyrnog.           </content>
