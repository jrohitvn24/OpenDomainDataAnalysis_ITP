		<content> Grytvicken Harbour in South Georgia in
 24 metres of water and was fully      
 primed with torpedoes.The divers had  
 to raise the submarine and tow it 50  
 miles out of harm's way, then sink it.
 They used various types of equipment  
 on the Santa Fe:- cutting discs to    
 make holes in the submarine and also  
 welding patches over the shell        
 holes.Working in extremely cold       
 conditions all the divers had to wear 
 special diving suits.The              
 decrompression chamber is used to help
 divers suffering from the 'Bends' or  
 decrompression sickness the most      
 common form of which is a bubble of   
 nitrogen which hasn't dispersed and   
 has lodged somewhere in the body.By   
 the use of specific tables the bubble 
 can be dispersed.The chamber is       
 sometimes used to help people         
 suffering from arthritis.             </content>
