		<title>07PEOPLE OF STRYT_YR_HWCH</title>
		<content> WE WALKED FROM SONTLEY_FORD,WHICH     
 LAST'S FOR ABOUT ONE MILE.            
  THE FORD COMES OUT BY KILN_FARM      
 BUNGALOW WHICH WAS MOST PROBABLY BUILT
 IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE COULD NOT    
 CONFIRM THAT BECAUSE NOONE WAS IN.    
  WE WALKED A BIT FURTHER UNTIL WE     
 REACHED THE NEW COTTAGES. WE TALKED TO
 THE OWNER OF NUMBER ONE. HE SAID THAT 
 STRYT_YR_HWCH WAS NOT A VILLAGE IT    
 JUST SCATTERED IN THE COUNTRY SIDE.   
  AFTER A BIT MORE WALKING WE CAME TO  
 CLAY_PITS_BUNGALOW WHICH WAS MADE OF  
 HAND MADE BRICKS. AGAIN THERE WAS     
 NOONE IN.                             
  WE THEN CAME ACROSS CLAY_PITS_FARM   
 WHERE WE TALKED TO THE FARMER WHO SAID
 THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN 1905.          
  WE PASSED A FEW MORE HOUSES THE YEW  
 TREES, OAK COTTAGE AND GROVES COTTAGE.
