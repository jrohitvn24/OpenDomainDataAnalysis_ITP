		<title>01GROSMONT 1  LOCATION</title>
		<content> Grosmont is located on a hill which is
 why the the Normans called it{Grosmont
 which means{Big Hill.}They placed the 
 castle on the hill because it has a   
 magnificent view over the{Graig}and   
{Garway Hills}and the{River Monnow     
{valley}.It is central to{Ross,        
{Hereford,Abergavenny}and{Monmouth.    
 The majority of visitors come to the  
 village by car,some by bus or bicycle 
 and a few on foot.Most of the roads   
 around Grosmont are narrow and winding
 but it is a popular touring area      
 because it is so near to historical   
 sites like{Hereford Cathedral}and     
{Abergavenny,Skenfrith}and{White       
{Castles.}Very few visitors come into  
 the village by public transport,      
 because the service is so poor with   
 only two buses a week.These provide a 
 local service to Abergavenny and      
 Hereford on market days.              </content>
