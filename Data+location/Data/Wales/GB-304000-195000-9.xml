		<title>09A Visit to the Town Hall</title>
		<content> When we went to the town hall,the     
 first thing we did was ask questions  
 to the {Chief Executive Officer.}He   
 said that there are 38 councillors on 
 the Borough Council and that there    
 were 14 wards where elections took    
 place.He also said that to become an  
 officer you have to have a few years  
 in the council and pass a few         
 exams.The first council meeting was   
 held in 1894.We then went to an       
{Environmental Health Committee }      
 meeting.They discussed vandalised bus 
 shelters,but there is no money left to
 repair them this year.                
 The Lady Mayoress then took us to     
 another room where we had crisps and  
 biscuits.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
