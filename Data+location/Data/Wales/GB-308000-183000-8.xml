		<title>08FAMILY LIFE- EMPLOYED 1</title>
		<content> Family life tends to follow quite a   
 regular pattern.                      
 I earn enough for us to live          
 comfortably and my working hours are  
 regular so I have time to be with my  
 children. My wife works part time     
 because we think it is important for  
 there to be someone in the house when 
 the children come home from school. We
 have a car and manage to take regular 
 holidays.                             
 I am happier for my children to be    
 brought up in an area like this. I    
 think the education in the local      
 school is better than any they would  
 get in a Cardiff school. I also think 
 that there is less chance of then     
 getting involved in drugs, glue       
 sniffing and other bad habits.        
 I think the children are envious of   
 other children who live in towns but  
 believe they are better off here.     </content>
