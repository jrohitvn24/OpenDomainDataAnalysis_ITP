		<title>14ECOLOGY of the RHAYADER AREA</title>
		<content> The Rhayader area consists of small   
 fields for grazing or fodder crops,   
 with the higher ground covered with   
 heather and gorse.The River Wye and   
 Rydhir Brook flow through the area,   
 Salmon and Trout being caught in the  
 river. Numerous wild flowers grow in  
 the small deciduous woods and hedge-  
 rows.Two protected wild birds,Red Kite
 and Peregrine Falcon nest just outside
 the area but can be seen flying about 
 together with many other birds.       
 Footpaths and Bridleways are well     
 signposted and regularly used by both 
 Ramblers and Pony Trekkers.           
 The area receives a high annual rain- 
 fall causing resevoirs to be built in 
 the nearby Elan Valley.               
 There are no major manufacturing      
 industries and consequently pollution 
 is very low.                          
                                       </content>
