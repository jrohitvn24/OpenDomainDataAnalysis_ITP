		<content> The cottages in Arthog village on the 
 south side of the A493, their gardens 
 on the north side, are now mainly used
 as holiday homes.  The vicarage serves
 the Church of Wales in Arthog as well 
 as Fairbourne 3 miles SW.  Deciduous  
 woodlands rise steeply above the      
 village to open hill farm country and 
 the southern end of the Cader Idris   
 range at Tyrau Mawr, the whole area   
 forming part of Snowdonia National    
 Park.  The region is of interest to   
 geologists and popular with walkers   
 and tourists, especially Crogenan     
 Lakes and the waterfalls of Afon      
 Arthog.  Six hill farms cover and     
 extend beyond the area, rearing Welsh 
 Black cattle and agile little mountain

 first language of the farming         
 families.  Cottages formerly occupied 
 by smallholders and railway workers,  </content>
