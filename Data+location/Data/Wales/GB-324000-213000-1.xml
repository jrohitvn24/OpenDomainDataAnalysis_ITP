		<content> Gilwern and Govilon are situated in   
 the Usk Valley and inspite of the     
 agricultural nature of the area came  
 into being because of the Industrial  
 Revolution.In the surrounding         
 hillsides iron ore,limestone and coal 
 were discovered which resulted in the 
 establishment of the Llanelly and     
 Clydach Ironworks.Tramways were built 
 to all the neighbouring iron making   
 towns.Subsequently the Brecknock and  
 Abergavenny Canal was built,which     
 established a link with the tramways  
 and extended from Brecon to Newport   
 Docks.With the building of the canal  
 the villages expanded and became      
 flourishing communities.Today no      
 industry exists.Since the last war the
 villages have developed into much     
 sought after residential              
 areas.Residents commute to work to all
 parts of Wales and England.           </content>
