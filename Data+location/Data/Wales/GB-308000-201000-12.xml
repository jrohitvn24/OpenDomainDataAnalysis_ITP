		<content>     We have a local doctor who holds a
 surgery time a day and because the    
 village has no chemist shop the doctor
 dispenses the medicines he prescribes.
 The nearest hospital is Prince Charles
 hospital,Merthyr Tydfil.              
     There is a large number of owner  
 occupied houses in the village and a  
 small council house estate was built  
 in 1945.Since then very few new houses
 have been built due to the attitude of
 the County Council in restricting     
 development outside the village       
 boundary.
