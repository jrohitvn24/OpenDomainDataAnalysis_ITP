		<title>15Police station,Abercynon</title>
		<content> The old police station was opened in  
 1906 and had creepy cells,two large   
 courts and was very large.It closed   
 in1984 and the new police station with
 only three rooms,opened.There are six 
 police officers,one sergeant,a clerk  
 and a traffic warden who comes in     
 twice a week.The area has a lower{    
{crime rate}than other areas.When there
 is a crime where they need police dogs
 or other{special services,}they are   
 always availible.{Police training}in  
 Mid.Glam.takes place in Cwmbran and   
 Bridgend.People would rather the      
 police patrole on foot but the people 
 also want a fast reaction if there is 
 a crime.Thereis no other police       
 station in our block but people in    
 Cilfynydd would like a station in     
 their area.
