		<content> The old railway line runs along the   
 eastern side of our block.The station 
 was situated at STRATA FLORIDA just   
 off the north-eastern junction of our 
 map.It was closed in the mid fifties. 
 In SWYDDFFYNNON there is a war        
 memorial on the village square,and    
 also a smithy and old mill.One of the 
 villagers,Mr. Tom Davies remembers    
 being an apprentice there over 50     
 years ago.If you go in a              
 south-easterly direction towards      
 Ynys Y Berfedd you will reach CORS    
 CARON ,famous the World over as a     
 nature reserve.Another more recent    
 place of interest is the private home 
 set up by Mrs. Price of Llys Yr Awel  
 for the elderly.In 1985 for the first 
 time ever Swyddffynnon entered the    
 BEST KEPT VILLAGE competition-we did  
 not win,but we could be a place of    
 interest of our own if we do win ever.</content>
