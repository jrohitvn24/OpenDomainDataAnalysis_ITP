		<title>01THE POSITION OF GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> Our area is in Wales. We are near the 
 border with England. Our county is    
 Powys. Our part of Powys is called    
 Radnorshire. We live in the           
 Radnorshire Hills. There are no towns 
 near us. Kington is our nearest town  
 but it is only small. There are  2000 
 people in Kington. Kington is in      
 Herefordshire in England. It is five  
 miles to Kington from Gladestry. The  
 nearest big town is Hereford.  It is  
 twenty six miles to Hereford from     
 Gladestry. Hereford is where there are
 big shops. Our area is rural. We have 
 no factories around Gladestry. There  
 are mostly farms. There are not many  
 people in Gladestry. There are more   
 sheep than people. A lot of people    
 from outside come to live in Gladestry
 and many come to retire here because  
 they like the quiet way of life.
