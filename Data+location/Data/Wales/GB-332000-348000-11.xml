		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE (cont.)</title>
		<content> At 2.45 p.m. we go back indoors again 
 and have another lesson like Welsh.   
 Welsh is another language which Mrs.  
 Meredith teaches us. At 3.30 p.m. it  
 is home time. When I go home I make   
 myself a drink of cola on the Soda    
 Stream and I take some biscuits out of
 the tin. I watch television or do     
 homework that the teacher has given   
 me, usually Maths or English. At about
 4.45 p.m. I have tea. My favourite tea
 is fish-fingers and chips. Sometimes I
 go out to play with my friends        
 Danielle and Nicola, we play games    
 like frisby and tennis. At 7.30 I come
 in again and watch television. At 8.30
 p.m. mum gives me supper,a drink of   
 coffee and some biscuits. I then go to
 bed and fall asleep.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
