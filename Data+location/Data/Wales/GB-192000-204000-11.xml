		<title>11EARLY POTATOES AND DAIRYING</title>
		<content>    The farming in this area is{"mixed"
 mostly{early potatoes}and{dairying.   
    Early potatoes were started by a   
 small group of Pembrokeshire farmers  
 because the conditions are suitable.  
    The{potatoes}are planted in        
 February and lifted in late May to    
 June to command high prices. A new    
 type of potato{"the Puffin"}has       
 recently been introduced. Cheap{EEC   
 and{Egyptian potatoes}are proving     
 tough competition for local farmers.  
   {Dairy farming}is very{specialised  
 and farmers are extremely dedicated.  
 The farmer has to list every animal in
 the herd; he draws the markings and   
 records each calf's sex, date of birth
 and mother's pedigree.                
    The cows graze in the summer months
 and are fed indoors on silage, barley 
 and concentrates in the winter.
