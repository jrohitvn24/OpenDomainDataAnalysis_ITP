		<title>18RECREATION IN GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> There is not much in the village for  
 young people. There is no youth club. 
 The nearest youth club is Kington, or 
 there is the Young Farmers, which     
 meets in the Radnor Valley. Sometimes 
 there are discos in the village hall. 
 A lot of young people have to go out  
 of Gladestry to meet other people.    
 Some of them go to the pub instead,   
 and some are busy at home on the farm.
 For ladies there is the W.I. This     
 means the Women's Institute. The W.I. 
 meets every month in the hall. They   
 have visiting speakers and outings.   
 They also have a Rounders team.       
 There is not much for men to do, so a 
 lot of them go to the pub.            
 There is a football team called Vale  
 of Arrow. You can play golf at        
 Rhosgoch or Kington. The nearest      
 public swimming pool is at Hereford.  
 Some of the farmers go shooting.      </content>
