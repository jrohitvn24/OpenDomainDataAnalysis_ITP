		<title>16Llanfihangel to Capel Seion</title>
		<content> There is usually at least one member  
 of each community on the Community    
 Councils. Capel Seion people would    
 like to see a post office/shop in the 
 area &amp; generally people wanted a      
 tidier area with more liter bins for  
 the tourists. Both communities hold a 
 number of fund raising activities     
 either for their respective schools or
 chapels or for local &amp; national       
 charities &amp; hospitals. Llanfihangel   
 would like to see more activities for 
 the children in the village. Both     
 communities would like to see some    
 cottage industry in the area, although
 in the main they prefer the villages  
 to stay as they are.
