		<content> St. John's Church, Alltwen which is   
 mainly in the Cilybebyll Parish of the
 Llandaff diocese was built in 1868 by 
 a local landowner, Mr. Moore Gwyn.    
 There are 101 people on the electoral 
 role with an average of 55 people     
 attending each Sunday.  The Rector,   
 Mr. Hough is also Rural Dean of Neath.
 There are 2 church wardens - a        
 people's warden elected by church     
 members and a church warden chosen by 
 the Rector - with a Parochial Council 
 consisting of elected church members, 
 chosen in the Easter Vestry meeting   
 every year.  Communion service, Sunday
 School and Evensong takes place every 
 Sunday with baptism when needed taking
 place during these services.  The     
 language of worship is English with an
 occasional Welsh hymn.  The Rector and
 the minister of Alltwen Chapel now    
 exchange pulpits 1 Sunday each year.  </content>
