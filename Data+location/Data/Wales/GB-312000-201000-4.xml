		<content> I rise at 7.30 and I start organising 
 the children for school. While they   
 are eating breakfast, I make the beds 
 and clean up. At 9.00 the girls Claire
 and Nina leave for school &lt;ELLIOT TOWN
 PRIMARY SCHOOL>, and then I clean the 
 kitchen. I leave for work at 9.30, to 
 work at my fathers "Off Licence" which
 closes at 13.00.                      
  My afternoon is spent dressmaking,   
 gardening or cleaning; also I  prepare
 dinner for my husband who is a welder,
 and my children.                      
  When the family are home and dinner  
 is over, I sometimes go cycling or for
 a walk with my family. The girls go to
 bed around 21.30 and then my husband  
 and I watch television, and Inormally 
 knit during this time. We go to bed   
 about 23.30.
