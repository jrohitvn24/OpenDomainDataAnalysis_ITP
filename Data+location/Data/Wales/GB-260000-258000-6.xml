 when he studied at St.David's         
 University Lampeter.                  
   He wakes at 6 am and gets dressed.He
 then takes his dog for a walk.At about
 6:30 he reads the Bible and prays     
 until breakfast at 8:00.              
   After breakfast he goes to his study
 where he reads and writes until lunch 
 at 12:30.After lunch he visits his    
 parishioners,especially the sick      
 and elderly.He enjoys visiting people.
   When he returns to the Rectory he   
 has his tea and relaxes for a short   
 time before he attends meetings.      
   On Monday evening he runs a         
 children's club called The            
 Explorers.After his evening work he's 
 tired and ready for a rest.
