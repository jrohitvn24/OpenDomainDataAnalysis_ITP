		<content> This area is well served by both      
 chapels and churches.The number       
 indicates the greater population of   
 the past and the a more religious     
 community.                            
 There are three parishes within the   
 block and their respective churches.  
 All are Church of Wales.There is also 
 a Roman Catholic church and a         
 Salvation Army citadel.               
 The majority of religious buildings   
 are chapels _ten in all:they represent
 several denominations:_Baptist,       
 Methodist, Congregational and         
 Jehovah's Witness.                    
 Many of these Chapels share a minister
 and in two cases hold services on a   
 rota basis.                           
 The chapels are declining in          
 attendance and some are being closed  
 and amalgamated. There is also a      
 chapel and public cemetery.           </content>
