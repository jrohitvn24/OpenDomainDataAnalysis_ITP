 One game is tick lines. One person is 
 on and chases the others along the    
 lines of the netball pitch trying to  
 tick them. We call the centre circle  
 "Bally", nobody can tick you in Bally.
     British Bulldog is a popular      
 game.At the beginning one child stands
 in the middle while the others run    
 from one side of the playground to the
 other. The child in the middle tries  
 to catch the running children. If he  
 is successful he shouts "British      
 Bulldog 123" and the caught child     
 helps to catch the others.            
      We also play a handstand game    
 called Knives, Forks and Spoons.      
 Another tick game is called Buzz Off. 
 We have a song game called The Wind.
