		<title>02Farming in the Leewood area</title>
		<content>  Farming in this area is varied. A    
 survey found the following activities:
 dairy and beef cattle,sheep,poultry,  
 pigs,cereals and potatoes.            
  Cattle are mainly Friesians or       
 Herefords.                            
  Some farms have sheep which they own 
 thoughout the year,but other farms    
 have tack sheep which are brought     
 down from the mountains near Bala in  
 winter and kept on the farm for six   
 months.                               
  Some farms own horses for riding.    
  The cereals grown include barley     
 and oats. Many fields produce silage  
 and hay.                              
   A minority of farms have poultry,   
 while others breed pheasant and trout 
 for sportsmen.
