		<content> Habitats range from marshy fields     
 often flooded by the Conwy, through   
 steeply sloping woodland, to high,    
 bare,rocky moorland, thus supporting a
 variety of wild life. The climate is  
 mild, sheltered by the mountains to   
 the north west, but with above average
 rainfall.                             
 Fauna includes toad, frog, adder,     
 grass snake,slow worm,mole, shrew,    
 weasel, stoat, fox, badger, rabbit    
 and grey squirrel.                    
 Birds include buzzards, sparrowhawks, 
 kestrels, owls, woodpeckers, tree     
 creepers,jays, magpies,pigeons,collar 
 doves, goldcrests,spotted fly-catchers
 tits,finches and most common birds.   
 Herons and other water birds are found
 near the river, whilst jackdaws are   
 common near houses,ousting the        
 ubiquitous starlings of towns.        
 Ravens occur in the hills.            </content>
