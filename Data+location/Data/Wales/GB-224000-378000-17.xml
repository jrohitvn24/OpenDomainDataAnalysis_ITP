		<content>   I play a lot of games , heres a list
 of them football , climbing , looking 
 for shells , skipping stones ,        
 skipping , swimming ,  fighting , go  
 for walks , looking for old houses.   
   I play football in Cae Bog.I think  
 it is a good place to play football as
 the ground is hard.There are two      
 goals each side.                      
  I climb nearly everywhere.It is a    
 good hobby but sometimes it is        
 dangerous.                            
  I have a wide selection of shells.I  
 collect them from beaches.            
  Skipping stones is quite good.You    
 have to remember to do a lot of       
 things.                               
 Looking for houses is a good hobby.But
 it is best to go with a grown up as it
 is dangerous.
