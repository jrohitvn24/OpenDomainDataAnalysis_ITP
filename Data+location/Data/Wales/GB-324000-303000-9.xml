   We often visit Holy Trinity Church  
 and sometimes take part in special    
 sevices. The owner of Leighton Hall,  
 John Naylor, had it built in 1851. It 
 is a beautiful church,built of Cefn   
 sandstone. It has a tall spire which  
 is a landmark in the area. There are  
 buttresses supporting the walls and   
 high roof outside, and stained-glass  
 windows and carvings inside. Thereis a
 small chapel to the right of the      
 pulpit, which contains memorials to   
 all the Naylor family. The central    
 sculptured figure of an angel is the  
 work of Georgiana Naylor. Although in 
 Wales, it is in the Diocese of        
 Hereford.
