		<title>01Entrance to Olchon Valley</title>
		<content> Olchon Valley is a dead end valley    
 situated below the main Black Mountain
 ridge on the Easter Side.  This       
 glacial valley is blocked by Black    
 Hill to the east and Hay Bluff to the 
 north.  Looking south down the valley 
 it joins golden valley which runs down
 to Pontrilas on the main Hereford  to 
 Abergavenny road.  Several remote     
 farms are in evidence maily concerned 
 with grazing cattle and ship.  The    
 ridges either side of the valley rise 
 very steeply to over 2000 feet with   
 many spring and feeder streams running
 into Olchon Brook on the valley floor.
  A public road runs along the valley  
 to the Northern end on one side and   
 passes over the brook at the extreme  
 to return on the other side of the    
 valley. A public right of way footpath
 links the 2 sides of the road loop at 
 Beili-Bach to little Black Hill.      </content>
