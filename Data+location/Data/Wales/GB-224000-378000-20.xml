		<title>20FARMING</title>
		<content>    There are lots of farms in our area
 and quite a few people work on these  
 farms.We get lots of food from farm   
 animals_ from pigs we get pork and    
 bacon _ from cows _ milk and beef _   
 from lambs we get meat. To_day the    
 farmers have machinery to help them   
 with their work.                      
    Anglesey aluminiym owns a lot of   
 land on Holy Island their main farm   
 is TY Mawr and this is next our       
 school.                               
   Ty mawr is a large farm but there   
 are many smaller ones on Holyhead     
 too.These farmers keep a few animals _
 cows _ sheep _ hens etc.Sometimes     
 these farmers allow their land to be  
 used for camping too.
