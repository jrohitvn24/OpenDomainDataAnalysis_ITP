		<content>{A COUNCILLOR'S VIEW OF ABERDARE.      
  County Cllr Fitzgerald thinks the    
 main problems facing this area are    
 poor housing,unemployment and a run   
 down of services generally. Although  
 there have been many environmental and
 recreational improvements such as the 
 Sports Centre,Country Park and the    
 clearing of waste tips,the area still 
 lags behind other similar areas in the
 country.It was suggested to Welsh     
 M.P.s that the valleys should be      
 allowed to decline as people move away
 to find work.Cllr. Fitzgerald sees    
 this as a serious threat to community 
 spirit.This spirit was demonstrated   
 during the recent year-long miners'   
 strike.He believes that although this 
 is a difficult period,Aberdare will   
 still survive and retain its identity 
 and not become a commuter belt for    
 Cardiff.                              </content>
