		<content> The area we have studied is a tipical 
 Welsh mining valley.                  
    The housing consists of council and
 private "estates"and older terraced   
 housing.                              
    Education ranges from "nursery"    
 through to further education and      
 "special"education.                   
    It is a "black spot"for employment.
 The few factories in the area are     
 small and employ a limited number.    
 Therefore people travel outside for   
 work.                                 
    With high unemployment and people  
 leaving the areas trade and           
 recreational facilities have been     
 affected.Many shops and cinemas have  
 closed leaving derilect buildings.    
    The redeeming features are the     
 country park and the wide range of    
 facilities for care of the elderly.
