		<title>03Transport in Flint</title>
		<content> The{main coast road}linking the       
 Midlands to the coastal resorts of    
 North Wales passes through the town of
 Flint bringing frequent{traffic jams} 
 especially during the summer months   
 with the{tourist traffic.}As a result 
 the County Council are planning a     
{bypass.}Two routes are being          
 considered- the{Brown route}through   
 farm land, and the{Blue route}which   
 crosses waste land between the Estuary
 and the Castle. We decided to{debate} 
 the issue in school with pupils       
 playing the part of Councillors. The  
{farmers}in class were worried that    
 their farms would be demolished.      
 James, a boy in class 4, objected to  
 the Blue route because of the danger  
 to the{foundations}of the Castle. The 
{final decision}was in favour of the   
 Blue route, crossing the marsh land. I
 wonder what the council will decide?  </content>
