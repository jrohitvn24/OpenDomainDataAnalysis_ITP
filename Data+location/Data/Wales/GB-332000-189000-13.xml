		<content> All this together with its friendly   
 atmosphere, attractive setting,       
 community events and abundance of pubs
 and restaurants, make Caerleon a very 
 pleasant place to live                
 To do the survey we had to go around  
 asking people why they liked living in
 Caerleon. Everyone I asked said       
 they didnt like the new houses being  
 built. Some said it is near to work,  
 motorway, country and Newport. Not    
 many people liked the traffic.
