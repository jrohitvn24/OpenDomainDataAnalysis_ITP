		<content> We came out of the woods at the top of
 the hill where there was a large field
 which was being cut by the farmer for 
 silage.Over the field we saw a Sparrow
 Hawk hovering over a creature probably
 disturbed by the tractor.To the right 
 of us was the ruins of a farm         
 "Trefraith".The next field brought no 
 luck at all,Gareth Parry lost his     
 fountain pen and Mark Draper lost his 
 65p dinner money.                     
 We crossed three fields all growing   
 either silage or hay,we passed a      
 Tumulus and joined a narrow lane and  
 proceeded along it in a north westerly
 direction.The fields on either side   
 were either silage,hay or pasture.We  
 saw cattle,sheep and horses.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
