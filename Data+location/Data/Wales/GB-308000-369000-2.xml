		<title>02BODFARI SCHOOL POPULATION</title>
		<content> Ysgol Bodfari is a small bilingual    
 rural school.There are sixty full time
 pupils and eight pupils in the        
 school's part time nursery.It is      
 interesting to note that only 54% of  
 the children come from the Bodfari    
 area,the remaining children coming    
 from the surrounding villages of      
 Llandyrnog (12%),Tremeirchion (7%),   
 Afonwen (3%) and from the town of     
 Denbigh (22%) which is four miles     
 away.                                 
       With so many children living    
 outside the village it is not         
 surprising that only one in ten of the
 children walk to school.In fact 26% of
 the children living in the area need a
 taxi to come to school because they   
 live in the farms and small holdings  
 dotted around the village.
