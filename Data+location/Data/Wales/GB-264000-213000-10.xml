 these families spend their leisure    
 hours at home.                        
    It seems that{98%}of families spend
 some time reading,{62%}have a hobby   
 which they pursue and{77%}of families 
 have access to some kind of musical   
 instrument.

 on electrical/technical equipment as a
 means of entertainment. The table
