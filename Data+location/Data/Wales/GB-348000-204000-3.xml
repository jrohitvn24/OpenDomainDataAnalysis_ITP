		<content> THERE ARE 33 CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL, 2
 TEACHERS, A NURSERY ASSISTANT, A      
 SECRETARY, 3 COOKS, AND 1 CARETAKER.  
 THE SCHOOL IS DATED 1820 AND THERE IS 
 ONE ROOM. IT IS HEATED WITH A GAS     
 HEATER AND AN OPEN FIRE. THE FOOD IS  
 COOKED IN THE CANTEEN AND IS EATEN IN 
 THE CLASSROOM. WE DO P.E. AND CONCERTS
 IN THE CHURCH HALL. THE TOILETS ARE   
 OUTSIDE. ON THE FOOTBALL PITCH THERE  
 ARE TWO TREES. OUR HEADTEACHER'S      
 OFFICE IS UPSTAIRS. IT IS A NARROW    
 STAIRCASE AND VERY WINDEY. THE AGE    
 RANGE IS 4 TO 11. THE JUNIORS AND     
 INFANTS ARE SEPARATED BY A SCREEN.    
 I COME TO SCHOOL IN A TAXI, SOME COME 
 IN PARENT'S CARS AND SOME WALK. IT IS 
 DUE TO CLOSE IN TWO YEARS.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
