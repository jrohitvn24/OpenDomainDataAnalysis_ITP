		<title>05THE CAMP</title>
		<content> The camp was opened in 1960 by{Her    
{Majesty the Queen.}The Junior Soldiers
 who live in the camp are from the     
 Prince of Wales Division. The camp is 
 an Infantry Depot where the           
 soldiers train to use rifles. There   
 are 325 Junior Soldiers. In the camp  
 there are no helicopters or tanks but 
 they have five land-rovers. The Junior
 Soldiers join at the age of sixteen.  
 They get up at about 6.30 a.m.,have   
 their breakfast at 7.00 a.m.They need 
 to be very fit.When they are out they 
 take a haversack,a gun,a water        
 bottle,a sleeping bag,a ground sheet  
 and a gas mask. It has now been       
 decided that the Junior Soldiers are  
 going to a new camp near              
 Folkestone.The camp will remain in the
 hands of the army as a Territorial    
 unit.
