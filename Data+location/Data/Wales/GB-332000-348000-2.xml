		<title>02WREXHAM BEAST MARKET</title>
		<content> The beast market is packed with       
 people. Most people have prams and    
 pushchairs and buggies. Some people   
 have lots of bags and especially      
 carrier bags. There are thousands of  
 stalls here not to mention the people 
 who come to look round. Some people   
 buy clothes, others jewellery or      
 shoes. Little children buy toys, books
 or games. Housewives buy brushes,     
 dish cloths, soap or toilet tissue.   
 The market is very different to       
 Tesco's or Asda. The market is an open
 market but Tesco's and Asda isn't.    
 There are a lot of food shops here and
 even ice cream vans and hot dogs      
 etc... We also have a Thursday market 
 now which means that if people want to
 come to the Monday market but they    
 can't get there, then they might be   
 able to go to the market on a Thursday
 instead. The Markets are very big.    </content>
