		<title>11The Rugby Football Club.</title>
		<content> The game of Rugby Football is         
 important to the people of West Wales,
 it is more a way of life than a game  
 played by 30 persons. Ninety nine per 
 cent of West Wales villages have a    
 Rugby Team and Tumble at the moment is
 one of the strongest in the West Wales
 Rugby Union League. The team was      
 formed in 1897 and they use the Great 
 Mountain Club as Headquarters. The    
 Club now has become the focal point   
 for the villagers.                    
   The team during the past seasons has
 won numerous trophies, and this season
 1984-85 they were League Champions    
 after finishing at the top of Section 
 "A".They also won the "President's    
 Cup" which is played for between the  
 League Champions and the Cup Winners. 
   Tumble has produced several Welsh   
 Senior and Youth Internationals, the  
 most recent being Gareth Davies.      </content>
