		<content> Since 1968 there has been an annual   
 agricultural and horticultural show   
 held in Llangadog.It is organised by  
 members of the local Y.F.C.and other  
 villagers.The show was held on a      
 Wednesday,but is now always held on   
 the first Saturday in August in a     
 field at Glansawdde Farm.             
    The entries in the Friesian cattle 
 section is very high and the local    
 people think that the standard of     
 Llangadog show is higher than in the  
 Royal Welsh Show.Horses,ponies,sheep  
 and goats also compete. In the        
 horticultural tent there are          
 competitions in cookery,fruit,floral  
 art,flowers,vegetables,handicraft and 
 art.There is also a dog show, baby    
 show,tractor handling,gymkhana and    
 horse jumping.There is a rodeo or

 followed by a disco dance in the tent.</content>
