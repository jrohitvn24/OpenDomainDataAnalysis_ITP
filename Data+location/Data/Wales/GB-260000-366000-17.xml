       ________________                
 We asked an old man who has lived in  
 our village all his life what changes 
 had taken place in his lifetime.This  
 was his reply.                        
    "I have seen many changes but the  
 biggest change was when we got        
 electricity for the first time.Another
 change was the building of the council
 estate some 30 years ago.The village  
 doubled in size and maybe lost some of
 its warmth.People now mind their own  
 business,whereas in the old days      
 everyone knew everyone else.The       
 number of men who work in the quarry  
 has gone down a lot.One change that   
 I'm glad took place is the Health     
 service.People live a lot longer today
 because of a good health service."
