		<title>16PONTYPOOL HERITAGE 1</title>
		<content>   In recent times there has been more 
 interest in preserving our industrial 
 heritage.                             
   Coal mining and iron industries were
 the basis of this valley's prosperity.
 The iron trades have gone and coal    
 mining is declining but mementoes of  
 this time are being preserved for     
 tourism.                              
   The "Truck"shop at Pontymoile is to 
 be restored.This was a shop used by   
 iron workers who exchanged their pay  
 of Tokens for household goods at      
 prices fixed by the owners who were   
 the Ironmasters.                      
  Colliers and miners cottages higher  
 up the valley are preserved for us to 
 see how ordinary working people used  
 to live in the 18th and 19th          
 centuries.Industrial artifacts are    
 displayed at our Valley Inheritance   
 Museum at Pontypool.                  </content>
