		<content> Ten schools are situated within the   
 block providing nursery,infant,primary
 secondary,Welsh medium,private and    
 special education.The{E.S.N.}school is
 closing to make way for the resiting  
 of{Frongoch Primary School,}its pupils
 being intergrated into existing       
 "mainstream" schools.                 
 The{High School}is under-going  major 
 re-modelling since it has become      
 situated on a single site.First       
 priority has been given to the school 
 building work although there is public
 concern over the delay in starting the
{sports centre}project which has been  
 delayed due to a Welsh Office spending
 moratorium.The present gymnasium was  
 built more than 25 yrs. ago when the  
 school had 300 pupils.It has now      
 become inadequate for a school of{1000
{pupils}and a town with an approximate 
 population of{9000. }                 </content>
