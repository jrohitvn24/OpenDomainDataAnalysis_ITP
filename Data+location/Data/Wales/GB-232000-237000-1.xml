		<content> This is a rural area in the parishes  
 of Llangeler and Penboyr. The dividing
 line between  the two is the River    
 Bargod which flows  through blocks    
 3538 and 3539. (Bargod is a Welsh word
 meaning  edge,eaves) The land surface 
 is uneven and varied but beautiful,   
 overlooking the fertile Teifi Valley. 
 On the  southern  side there is the   
 peaty high ground _ now cultivated and
 used as grazing land for sheep and    
 cattle. The land slopes gradually to  
 the north,forming deep and densely    
 wooded valleys, and finally levelling 
 out to form the rich pasture land on  
 the banks of the Teifi.Farming is very
 prominent in the district and is the  
 main industry  since the decline of   
 the woollen industry in the 1920s.Most
 of the farms are mixed and dairy      
 farms.                      {A.Davies.
