		<content>     {Lliswerry High School}was first  
 opened in November 1974 and attracted 
 a large number of pupils. The first   
 headmaster was Dr.John Herbert, who   
 retired in December 1984.             
      An art block,a music suite and a 
 sixth form block were added to the    
 original buildings as the school      
 developed until there were seven years
 in the school. Then a leisure centre  
 was added which extended the sports   
 facilities for the school.            
      The school regularly has winners 
 at the{National Urdd Eisteddfod,}being
 the only school in Newport where{Welsh
 is studied. Pupils have represented   
 Wales and Great Britain in Sports     
 teams. Pupils have left school to     
 attend many Universities. A team of   
 staff and pupils ran a relay from John
 O'Groats to Lands End to raise money  
 for the Ethiopian Appeal.             </content>
