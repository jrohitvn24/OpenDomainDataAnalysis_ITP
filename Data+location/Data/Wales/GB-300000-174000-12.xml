		<title>12FORESTRY COMMISSION_TREE USE</title>
		<content> The Forestry Commission in our block  
 consists of the nursery at Tair Onen  
 and the plantation at Hensol Forest   
 which we visited. It covers 8000      
 hectares of land. Most of the trees   
 are conifers but some are deciduous to
 attract wildlife. Oak trees mature in 
 120 yrs, spruce trees in 60,so        
 conifers are the minimum cash crop.   
 The volume of wood taken from the     
 forest is planned by computers.Felled 
 trees are taken to local sawmills.The 
 trees are mainly used for making      
 paper,but others are sold for timber  
 and firewood. Every year 40-50,000    
 Christmas trees are grown but more as 
 a public service than for profit      
 making.                               
   Fire is a problem. If it starts in  
 dry ferns it can spread quickly and   
 cause much damage.{  cont. P.13}
