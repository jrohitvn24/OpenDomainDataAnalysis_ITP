		<content>      The railway which once linked the
 town of{Neath}with{Craig-y-Nos}in the 
 Swansea Valley, carrying hundreds of  
 men to and from their place of work in
 the many working collieries of the    
 Dulais Valley, lost its passenger     
 committment in the 1960s and is now   
 used to transport{coal}down the valley
 from the washeries at Onllwyn.        
      The main road artery through the 
 Dulais Valley is the{A4109}although at
 the period of the Roman occupation the
 major link between south and          
 mid-Wales,{Sarn Helen,}passed along   
 the ridge to the east of the valley.  
 From Crynant,the{A4109}may be followed
 to its joining with the{A465(T)}at    
 Glyn-Neath, in the Vale of Neath. As  
 an alternative there is a road link   
 with the Swansea (Tawe) Valley across 
 the Rhos Common to Ystradgynlais in   
 the County of Powys.                  </content>
