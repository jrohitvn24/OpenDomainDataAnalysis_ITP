		<title>12THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Rhosgoch primary school, which serves
 the whole area, was opened just thirty
 years ago and now has over 50 pupils  
 aged between 4 and 11 years old. It   
 has 3 teachers and numerous           
 peripetetic teachers come in for      
 specialist subjects. Nobody speaks    
 Welsh or studies it, this being an    
 anglicised area. The children study on
 a formal timetable maths, English,    
 history, geography, science, RI, art, 
 craft and sport. The older pupils also
 add French to their curriculum. The   
 hobby of the school is entering       
 competions and this adds much money to
 the government capitation of only Â£400
 p.a for the complete education of the 
 school. Meals are cooked on the site  
 and eaten by 42 of the 50 chidren in  
 the school. Only one child qualifies  
 for a free meal.
