		<content>  There are{thirteen pubs}in Usk and   
 some are very old.                    
 The{Castle Inn}was built in the 11th  
 century and was a quarter of the size 
 it is now. When it was built it was a 
 plain hut and inside it was dull and  
 shabby. The{Innbetween}is a public    
 house dating from the 17th century.   
 There used to be a ghost who sat on   
 the end of a bed. The{Cross Keys Inn  
 has changed little since it was       
 constructed, in the 16th century, and 
 the interior still retains much of its
 original plaster ceiling and beams.   
 The{Glan_yr_afon}is a magnificent     
 gothic villa of 1868, and is now a    
 hotel.The{Royal Hotel}was built about 
 18th century as a private house. It   
 has a very fine shop front with its   
 two bowed windows which make it look  
 very pretty.                          
 Pubs are popular as{entertainment.}   </content>
