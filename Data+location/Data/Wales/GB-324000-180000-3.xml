  The nearest large shop is a          
 supermarket where you can buy almost  
 anything but most especially food     
 .None of us live close enough to walk 
 there so we usually go once a week by 
 car to shop.                          
  Locally, we have several small shops.
 The main one is a post office where   
 you can buy stamps and postal orders. 
 Outside there is a post box to send   
 your letters. The post office also    
 sells food,newspapers,sweets,drinks,  
 vegetables,and some toys.             
  In the village there is also a small 
 food shop that sells tinned food and  
 frozen food. If we need things for our
 garden there is a garden centre in the
 village as well.                      
  The shops usually close by 5.30pm but
 sometimes an ice cream van will come  
 later, selling ice cream and drinks.  </content>
