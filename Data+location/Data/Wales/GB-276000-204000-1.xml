		<content>      Crynant is a village situated in 
 the Dulais Valley approximately six   
 miles north of the town of Neath.     
      The name 'Dulais' seems to be a  
 fairly common name for a river and is 
 formed from 'du' which is Welsh for   
 black, and 'glais' which means stream,
 hence the 'black stream'.             
      According to local historians the
 more common spelling of Crynant is a  
 mis-spelling of the Welsh{Creunant}   
 where the Welsh -eu- is given an      
 English y-sound. It is a compound word
 made from 'crau'+'nant' where the     
 latter means 'brook' but the former   
 'crau' could possibly mean 'bloody'   
 or 'sty,stockade'.                    
      Although the postal address of   
 the village reads{Crynant}the primary 
 school has the title of{Creunant
