		<content> There are many different types of     
 hedges such as thorn hedge, which is  
 the most common.  There are also      
 others such as box hedge, copper      
 beech, privet, holly hedge and many   
 more.                                 
                                       
 You mostly find thorn hedge around the
 fields.  They are grown from little   
 twigs which are cut from a hedge and  
 planted into the ground.  This is     
 mostly done between about October and 
 April and gives them a chance to catch
 and grow.                             
                                       
 A hedge is a very popular place for   
 birds to build their nests, out of    
 sight, so that people will not take   
 their eggs.  Birds are very wise.
