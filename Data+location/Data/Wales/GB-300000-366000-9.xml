		<title>09POPULATION IN HENLLAN</title>
		<content> \\                                    
                                       
 The population of the block is approx.
 700,most of whom live in the village  
 of Henllan.The remainder live in      
 isolated farmhouses.Two thirds of the 
 people were born in Wales,the rest    
 being English.Just over a 1/4 are     
 under 16 whilst just under 1/5 are    
 over the age of 65.                   
 The population has grown considerably 
 in the last 15 years mainly by        
 migration.                            
 There are few places of employment in 
 the block and most workers have to    
 travel varying distances to work.Due  
 to a limited public transport service 
 with only one bus route to Denbigh    
 there is a dependence on private car  
 transport. There is a high level of   
 car ownership - 1 car per household.
