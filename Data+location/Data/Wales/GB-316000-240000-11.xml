 The River Wye meanders through three  
 of our areas.The surrounding low land 
 is fertile and planted with corn.     
 This stretch of river is known as the 
 Maesllwch Fishery.The Fishery Manager 
 came to school to talk to us.He had   
 just caught a 10lb salmon which would 
 cost Â£40 in the shops.He showed us a  
 variety of rods,spinners,hooks and    
 weights for spin fishing.He also      
 showed us a beautiful variety of      
 flies for fly fishing.                
 The types of fish found in the Wye are
 Chub,Dace,Roach,Barble,Bleak,Gudgeon, 
 Grayling,Pike,Eel,Sea Trout(Sewin),   
 Twait,Shad,Perch,Trout and Salmon.    
 The scales of every salmon caught have
 to be sent to the Fishery Department, 
 Hereford together with the weight,type
 of rod used and date caught.The Wye is
 noted for its Spring Salmon.          </content>
