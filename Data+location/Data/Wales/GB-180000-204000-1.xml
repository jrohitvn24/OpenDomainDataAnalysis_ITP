		<content> This area is at the extreme s.w.      
 corner of Wales,in the former county  
 of Pembrokeshire,now merged into      
 Dyfed,but often referred to as "Little
 England beyond Wales".It is a coastal 
 region,adjacent to Milford Haven.The  
 land is used for mixed agriculture,   
 with the village of{Dale}(pop.171)    
 being the main centre of population.  
  The entry channels for the port of   
 Milford Haven pass through the sea    
 area which is also used for           
 recreational boating.The land is an   
 Old Red Sandstone plateau about 1-200'
 above sea-level,drained by 6 streams  
 flowing S and E into Milford Haven.The
 climate is mild but windy.Rainfall is 
 not excessive,sunshine is above       
 average and there are about 32 gales  
 per year.The whole area is part of the
{Pembs.Coast National Park}and tourism 
 is an important feature.              </content>
