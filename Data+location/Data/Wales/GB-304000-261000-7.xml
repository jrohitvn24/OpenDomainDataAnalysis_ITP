		<content>   Castell Collen is the largest main  
 Roman Camp in Wales.It has four       
 entrances.One entrance goes through   
 the river.There is always water at the
 camp.The camp itself inculdes an area 
 of nearly four acres forming almost a 
 square about 142 yards in length by   
 132 in breadth.The Romans built it in 
 75-85AD while fighting against the    
 Silures.In the 2nd century AD they    
 changed the defences to stone.There   
 is a long straight where they used to 
 train horses.The archaeologists found 
 that they had baths and a form of     
 central heating.All you can see now is
 a few stones and bumps.I went to see  
 it.It is also covered with grass.
