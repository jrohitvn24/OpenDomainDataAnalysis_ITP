		<title>01MOUNTAIN ASH AND ABERFAN</title>
		<content> Mountain Ash an Aberfan are both      
 South Wales mining communities,       
 situated along the edges of the steep 
 sided Cynon and Taff Valleys in long  
 rows of terraced houses.              
 They were developed at the latter part
 of the nineteenth century,with the    
 introduction of deep mining           
 techniques.                           
 Mountain Ash in particular is a       
 very run down locality with high      
 levels of unemployment,and virtually  
 no industry in the town itself.Aberfan
 does however have the Taff Vale       
 Colliery providing employment for some
 of the towns people.                  
 The population of both towns is about 
 15,000 and is tending to fall in both 
 towns especially Mountain Ash.Both    
 areas would be classed as working     
 class.
