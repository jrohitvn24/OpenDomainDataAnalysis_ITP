		<title>17A FARM VISIT TO G. VALLEY II</title>
		<content> they milked by hand,made butter for   
 the Fishguard market and sent the milk
 away in Metal Churns.Today the milk is
 collected in a bulk milk tank which is
 kept cool and stored until a large    
 milk tanker arrives on its daily visit
 to empty the tank and deliver it to   
 the bottling plant some miles away.It 
 was clear from our visit that farming 
 in the Gwaun Valley had not developed 
 as much as it was capable of.Machinery
 was generally basic but it did make   
 much easier than it had been in the   
 past.
