		<title>16PANTASAPH'S WHITE QUARRIES</title>
		<content> Recent years have seen a struggle to  
 prevent the re-opening of the "White  
 Quarries" at Pantasaph. After years of
 neglect,{nature had reclaimed the site
 as a sheltered habitat harbouring many
 interesting species of plant including
 wild orchids, cowslips, foxgloves and 
 a mixture of hawthorn,ash and sycamore
 trees.Rabbits,badgers and foxes are to
 be seen.Footpaths crossed the area,   
 which was used as a picnic spot and a 
 natural playground by children.Despite
 the campaign by the "White Quarries   
 Association" conservation group,the   
 first preparatory work on the{re-open-
{ing of the quarry,}to crush limestone 
 for industrial chemicals,began in 1985
 Heavy lorries,blasting and crushing   
 machinery causing plumes of dust will 
 soon{shatter the tranquility}of the   
 Franciscan Friars at the Monastery    
 and local residents.                  </content>
