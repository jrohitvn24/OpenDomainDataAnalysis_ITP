		<content>       The farmers rely on their cars  
 for transport and telephone for       
 communications.Some said that they    
 were the things that had helped       
 farmers and their wives the most in   
 the last fifty years. They made life  
 much easier.                          
  Shopping is done in Knighton, though 
 a few special items have to be bought 
 further afield where there is more    
 choice. They find their entertainment 
 in Knighton or on Television. The     
 nearest public houses are at Knighton,
 Bleddfa, Llangunllo and Lloyney.      
 Churches and Chapels of most          
 denominations are also within two or  
 three miles of the area. The farmers  
 were happy where they were living.
