		<title>18TRELLECH CHURCH</title>
		<content> THE FOCAL POINT OF TRELLECH VILLAGE IS
 THE LARGE GOTHIC CHURCH OCCUPYING THE 
 CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE. THE CHURCH GOES
 BACK TO THE 13TH. CENTURY, PROBABLY   
 REPLACING AN EARLIER NORMAN ONE.      
 SURROUNDING THE CHURCH IS A LARGE     
 CHURCHYARD,LOOKED AFTER, WITH GREAT   
 CARE, BY ALAN WATKINS. THERE HAS NOT  
 BEEN A VICAR SINCE APRIL 1984. IN     
 AUGUST 1985 JOHN DENERLY FROM KENT IS 
 GOING TO BE THE VICAR OF TRELLECH,    
 PENALT, AND CHAPLAIN OF THE CONVENT. A
 SMALL BUT ACTIVE SUPPORT FOR THE      
 CHURCH IS GIVEN BY TWO READERS, AND   
 ORGANIST, SECRETARY, AND A FLOWER     
 SECRETARY. THE CHURCH IS HEATED BY    
 GAS. APART FROM REGULAR CHURCH        
 SERVICES, IT IS ALSO USED FOR         
 WEDDINGS, AND FUNERALS.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
