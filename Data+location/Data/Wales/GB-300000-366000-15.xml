		<title>15HENLLAN COMMUNITY COUNCIL</title>
		<content>    In April 1985 Henllan was granted  
 its own Community Council after 600   
 years inside the borough of Denbigh.  
 For the previous ten years Henllan had
 a Neighbourhood Committee which borr_ 
 owed the constitution of a London     
 authority. This unofficial 'watchdog' 
 was established because local people  
 thought that Henllan was being neglec_
 ted by Denbigh.                       
    The ten members of the Community   
 Council meet once a month.Their brief:
 1) to discuss planning applications;  
 2) to improve the environment e.g.care
    of footpaths,bus shelters, and the 
    removal of abandoned vehicles;     
 3) to inform other Councils of the    
    needs of the village.              
 Henllan's one policeman gives the C.C.
 advice about traffic problems. He also
 serves Llannefydd and Groes.He helped 
 to police the miners'strike in '84-85.</content>
