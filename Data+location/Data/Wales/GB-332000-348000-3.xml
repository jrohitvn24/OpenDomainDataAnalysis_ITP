 My Dad John Hopkins who works in      
 Marstons Brewery gets up at 6.OO in   
 the morning with my Mum Pat Hopkins.  
 She has to get him ready for work. My 
 Mum makes him his breakfast and does  
 the housework. At 7.OO a.m. my Mum    
 gets me up ( Nicky Hopkins ) to get   
 ready for school. I get dressed and   
 washed and go down for my breakfast.  
 By now my Dad has gone to work, so    
 after I have had my breakfast I listen
 to Marcher Sound ( the local radio    
 station ) until 8.OO a.m. then I go to
 school. My Mum goes to town with my   
 Nanna. I get home at about 3.55 p.m.  
 and about ten minutes later my Dad    
 comes home, so then we have tea. After
 that we just watch the television from
 9.00 til about 9.30 p.m.,then I go to 
 bed. About ten o'clock til 10.30      
 p.m.,my Mum and Dad go to bed.        </content>
