		<content> The houses in the area are in the main
 the large farmhouse type still kept in
 their original form where ever        
 possible. The Elizabethan farmhouse   
 "Pwll Halog" being a perfect example, 
 (See Slide B).  Space in the home is  
 something now enjoyed as families are 
 much smaller than many years ago.     
 Smaller cottages are sold as soon as  
 they appear on the market with great  
 prospects for improvements being seen 
 by their purchasers. The local        
 Planning Authority is very strict and 
 no unsightly buildings or alterations 
 have been allowed to spoil the area.
