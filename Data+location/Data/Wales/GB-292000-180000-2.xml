		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY-COITY CASTLE</title>
		<content>   In the heart of Coity village stands
 the ruin of Coity Castle. It was built
 by the Turberville Family in the l2th 
 century.                              
   When William lst ordered The        
 Domesday Book to be written the chief 
 man in Coity was Morgan ap Meurig. He 
 lived in the court house (where the   
 ruin of the castle now stands) with   
 his beautiful daughter Sarah. After   
 Robert Fitzhammon had conquered       
 Cardiff he sent Payn de Turberville,  
 one of his fiercest knights to claim  
 the land around Coity. To avoid any   
 fighting with the well-armed Norman   
 soldiers, Morgan offered Payn the hand
 of his daughter Sarah. Payn and Sarah 
 were married and there was no blood   
 shed in Coity.                        
   The castle was occupied by the      
 Turbervilles from 1100-1360 and was   
 last used by the Gamage family.       </content>
