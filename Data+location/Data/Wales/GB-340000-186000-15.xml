		<title>15THE SCHOOL FIELD</title>
		<content>  In Magor,safe recreation areas are   
 not very easy to find,but when a child
 wants to go and play in a park,our    
 school is the best place to go and can
 provide many hours of pleasure.       
  On the school field campus there are 
 many amenities stones,two sets of     
 swings,hurdles and various other      
 things.                               
  There are not many places in Magor to
 play football but the school field has
 a set of goal posts so all of Magor's 
 budding footballers go there to       
 play.Everyone goes over to the field  
 to play many games or just to wait    
 until your friends arrive,as it is a  
 good place to meet.                   
  The school field is also a very safe 
 place to ride BMX bikes,the children  
 ride up and down the steep banks      
 around the field ,but it's also fun   
 just to follow the lines of the pitch.</content>
