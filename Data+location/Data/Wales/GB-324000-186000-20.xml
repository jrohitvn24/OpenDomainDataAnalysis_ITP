		<title>20RECREATION-THE CUB CAMP</title>
		<content>The first Rogerstone cub pack went to  
camp in Tredegar Park.It was raining   
all the time.When we went to bed we got
soaking because the water in the       
sodsheet got all over us.Also the 29th 
Sea Scouts went to camp.We all had a   
super time and being sea scouts we     
didn't mind getting wet.Some people    
said we ought to camp on the lake.Some 
of the ladies cooked our food which was
very nice.I and my two friends did our 
first aid badges.We got lost and Akela 
found us in the middle of the camp.Then
we cleaned out the stables that        
afternoon.The cubs had a singsong      
instead of a campfire because it       
bucketed down.We went back to our tents
and had tuckshop and when we went to   
bed we had a midnight feast.We put     
sherbet in coca cola and the coke      
exploded!
