		<title>12A MOUNTAIN WALK</title>
		<content> Where I live there are many mountains,
 this is because I live in a valley    
 near the{Brecon Beacons.}The most     
 attractive feature of Crickhowell is  
 the{Table Mountain}which overlooks the
 town.{Crickhowell}is  my town,deriving
 its name from a person called{Howell  
 who lived on the Table Mountain in a  
 large{Fort.}It is so quiet up in the  
 mountains,you can shut your eyes and  
 imagine you are{anywhere}or{anyone.   
 Also you feel as though you can touch 
 the clouds in the sky.Often when I    
 feel sad or miserable I go for a long 
 walk up the mountain and escape from  
 the problems and realities of life.It 
 is almost as though,a{perspex wall}is 
 erected between yourself and the town 
 below. The river and mountain streams 
 flow freely and often{squirrels}and   
{rabbits}are to be seen around the     
 mountainside.                         </content>
