 other birds of prey, crows and magpies

 other crops, and there are many       
 different kinds of tit and finch in   
 the hedgerows, including blue tit,    
 chaffinch and goldfinch, as well as   
 wagtails. Robins and wrens are seen   
 frequently. Seagulls come to feed on  
 crops and freshly ploughed land, from 
 the coast a few miles away. Many      
 kinds of snail and large slugs feed on
 the lush vegetation, and foxes,       
 rabbits, squirrels and hares are also
