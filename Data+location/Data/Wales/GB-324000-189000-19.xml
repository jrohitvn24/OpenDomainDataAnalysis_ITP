		<title>19SHOPPING SURVEY 2</title>
		<content> Of the 20 shops to whom we sent the   
 qustionnaire, only 16 replied. We do  
 not know why the other 4 did not. Five
 of the shops had suffered break-ins,  
 one of them only two weeks before.    
 They would not tell us how much had   
 been stolen.                          
 All the shops said their trade had    
 gone down since{ASDA}opened in        
 Rogerstone. Also, 6 shops have closed 
 in the same time.                     
 There is a new by pass road being     
 built around Risca, and all           
 shopkeepers are worried about how this
 will effect their trade.              
 When we asked our parents, we found   
 that most families do their grocery   
 shopping in{ASDA}and the average      
 weekly bill there for our families is 
 twenty seven pounds.
