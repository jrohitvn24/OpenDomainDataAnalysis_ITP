		<title>10THE RIVER OGMORE</title>
		<content> THE RIVER OGMORE STARTS AT THE BWLCH  
 AND FLOWS SOME SEVENTEEN MILES TO THE 
 SEA AT OGMORE-BY-SEA. THE GARW RIVER  
 JOINS THE OGMORE RIVER AT BRYN-MENYN, 
 THE LLYMFI RIVER JOINING IT A MILE    
 FURTHER ON AT ABERKENFIG.             
 THE RIVER ALSO FLOWS TO THE WATERWORKS
 IN NANTYMOEL, WHICH WAS BUILT IN 1926 
 AND IS SITUATED AT ONE OF THE HIGHEST 
 POINTS IN THE VALLEY.  IT FLOWS INTO  
 THE SETTLING TANK WHERE ANY MUD IN THE
 WATER IS FILTERED AND SETTLES AT THE  
 BOTTOM.  THE WATER GOES DOWN THE MAIN 
 PIPE INTO THE FILTER HOUSE WHERE IT IS
 CLEANED.  CHLORINE IS ADDED TO KILL   
 ANY GERMS LEFT IN THE WATER.          
 AT OGMORE-BY-SEA, A LARGE SEWERAGE    
 PLANT CLEANS ALL THE WASTE MATERIALS  
 SO THAT CLEAN WATER FLOWS BACK INTO   
 THE RIVER.
