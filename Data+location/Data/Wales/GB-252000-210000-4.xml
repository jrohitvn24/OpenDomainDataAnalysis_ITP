		<title>04Getting to work by a miner.</title>
		<content> I get up at 5.20 a.m.,I wash and go   
 downstairs. For breakfast I have a cup
 of coffee only as I do not like eating
 early in the morning. At 5.45 a.m.I   
 catch the bus to Cynheidre Colliery.  
 The bus arrives at the Colliery at    
 6.10 a.m. and I go to the baths to    
 change from my clean clothes into my  
 working clothes. Whilst changing I    
 have a chat with the men from the     
 oncoming shift.                       
 My day underground starts at 7 a.m.. I
 descend 600m. down the mine shaft in a
 cage. At this level I board transport 
 on an underground railway, this takes 
 me 4Km. to the end of the line, I then
 walk 200m. where I check in on a time 
 book. Before reaching my place of work
 I have another 300m. to walk, the time
 is now about 8 a.m..                  
                                       
                                       </content>
