		<content> It is a source of consternation for   
 the people of S.Glamorgan that now the
 airport has developed into a going    
 concern, the present Tory government  
 has decided to sell it off in line    
 with its plans to develop Stansted.   
 From{figures}available up to{1974}it  
 can be seen that at the start of the  
 expansion in{1969/70 125,017          
{passengers}were catered for. This     
 figure rose by more than{100%}to      
{275,888 in 1974.                      
 Facilities are first class and up to  
{1,300 cars}can be held in the carpark.
 A new cargo building has been built.  
 Main destinations are to holiday      
 resorts in{continental Europe.}During 
 the Summer months{Boeing 747's}fly    
 direct to{Canada and N.America}every  
 week. A further extension should be   
 completed by the early 1990's.
