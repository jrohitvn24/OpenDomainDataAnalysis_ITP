		<title>14School playtime games</title>
		<content> Our yard is very large and during our 
 playtime we play soccer,cricket,      
 rounders,skipping,hide and seek and   
 many other games.We enjoy having the  
 infants to join us in a game of"I sent
 a letter to my love".Everyone sits in 
 a circle and one person runs around   
 the outside carrying a handkerchief.  
 The person listens to the rhyme and   
 when the others start to say the      
 alphabet,he or she drops the hankie   
 behind a seated person.That person    
 rises and chases the other around the 
 ring before reaching the empty spot.If
 the first person is caught she or he  
 has to sit in the middle and suck his 
 thumb.Elastic skipping is also popular
 A circular chain is made of elastic   
 bands. Two people stand in the chain  
 using their ankles to keep it straight
 and a third person skips in and out.
