		<content> Mrs Jenkins was born in 1901.She is 84
 years old and has lived on the Graig  
 all her life.There were no taps or    
 toilets inside her house,they were in 
 the garden.She said that gas gave a   
 better light.She went to Graig-y-wion 
 school.If they were late they would   
 have the cane.It was a senior school, 
 boys were upstairs and girls down.She 
 said that school is more enjoyable in 
 1985 as she was only taught arithmetic
 penmanship and PE drill.They would    
 skip,play hop-scotch and whip the top.
 Now,children have more presents and   
 pocket money.She only had a market    
 penny to spend in Pontypridd market.  
 There are not as many shops on the    
 Graig now.Then people were more       
 friendly,you could leave your homes   
 open.Every night a policeman would    
 come around to check that everthing   
 was alright.(Lisa Marshall-Graig)     </content>
