		<title>07BRIDLEWAYS</title>
		<content>   Many people living in and visiting  
 the Lower Wye Valley area enjoy horse-
 riding and the woodlands and river    
 banks provide beautiful views for the 
 riders.Bridleways are paths which were
 originally used for villagers to get  
 to market.The bridleway from Brockweir
 to Bigsweir once extended to Monmouth.
   In 1830 it was moved nearer the     
 river so that men and horses could    
 pull barges up river.However in 1950  
 new maps showed the bridleway as a    
 footpath by mistake .When people      
 wanted to ride on the path a farmer   
 called Mr.Williams tried to stop them.
 It was left to a judge in the Crown   
 Court to decide that it was a bridle- 
 way,it was moved to its original posi-
 tion and the path by the river used as
 a footpath.Horse riders have to take  
 care not to use any footpaths in the  
 area,barriers are built to stop them. </content>
