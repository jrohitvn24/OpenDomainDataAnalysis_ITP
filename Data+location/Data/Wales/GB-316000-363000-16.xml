		<content> Three buildings have been used as the 
 village school in Cilcain. The first, 
 now a private dwelling, was built in  
 1799. A larger school was built about 
 1842, remaining in use until replaced 
 by the present school in 1962. It is  
 now used as the village hall.         
 Pupil-numbers at the school, called   
 'Ysgol y Foel', have risen in recent  
 years: there are now 88 children aged 
 4_11 at the school, while  3-year-olds
 normally attend a nursery-class each  
 afternoon. There are three full-time  
 and one part-time teaching staff, and 
 parents regularly help both in school 
 and with out-of-school activities. As 
 well as standard school-work, special 
 topics have recently included starting
 a school-garden and the monitoring of 
 nest-boxes erected in the grounds, and
 groups of older pupils have made trips
 to stay at two outdoor centres.       </content>
