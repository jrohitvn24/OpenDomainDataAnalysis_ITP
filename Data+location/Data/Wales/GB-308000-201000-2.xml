		<content>    The moutains have changed little in
 the last hundred years.Sheep graze    
 along with the mountain ponies.The    
 mountain roads are now tarmacadamed   
 and with the increase in car          
 ownership,much greater use is made by 
 the local inhabitants of these roads. 
 The Head of the Valley road is now    
 only six miles away and with the      
 closure of our railway station and the
 reduction in the bus services provided
 by South Wales Transport,the car plays
 an important part in our daily lives. 
 Also,the opening this year of the{A470
 &lt;South Wales to North Wales Trunk     
 road> duel carriageway,will also      
 affect this area.
