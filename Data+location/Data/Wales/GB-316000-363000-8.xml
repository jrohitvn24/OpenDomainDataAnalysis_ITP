		<content> Beef Cattle: Cattle are no longer bred
 on the farm; instead bull-calves are  
 bought in and raised and fattened     
 before being sold for beef. Usually   
 about forty Friesian calves are       
 purchased each year at the local Mold 
 cattle market. The calves, one week   
 old, may weigh about 50kg. They are   
 fed on reconstituted milk powder for  
 six weeks, with hay and barley-meal   
 being introduced after the first week.
 The calves are normally bought in the 
 late autumn and are kept inside over  
 the winter, before being let out to   
 graze in June. All the older cattle   
 are kept inside for the winter, often 
 from late November to early May, and  
 are then fed on hay or silage and     
 barley-meal. The barley straw is used 
 for bedding. The fattened bullocks are
 sold at two years old, when they may  
 weigh 600kg.                          </content>
