		<title>10A Typical Sunday At Sealand.</title>
		<content> On Sundays a lot people go to         
 Queensferry Church.The church is      
 called The Sacred Heart Of The Blessed
 Trinity.The church starts at 10:00am  
 till 11:00am. On Saturday, church is  
 from 6:30pm till 7:30pm. Church is    
 from 6:00pm till 7:30pm on Sunday     
 nights too.I usually go to church on  
 Sunday nights.I always go to church on
 holy days and if I get a chance to go 
 when we are off school in the morning.
 The church has a collection of money  
 for different people each week.I have 
 been to the Queensferry church since I
 was a baby,I was Christened there too.
 I have been confirmed there by a      
 bishop called Bishop Fox and I had my 
 first Holy Communion there too.Our    
 priest comes from Ireland and when he 
 goes to see his family a monk comes   
 and takes his place.
