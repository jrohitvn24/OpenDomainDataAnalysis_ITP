		<content> The surrounding roads are narrow,     
 twisty and steep in places, but the   
 traffic is not heavy, though it       
 increases in the summer months due to 
 tourists. The roads are badly affected
 by the snow and ice during the winter 
 but the council leave supplies of salt
 and grit to enable people to help     
 themselves when stuck as well as      
 ploughing out the roads when the snow 
 falls and gritting them if ice is     
 forcast.                              
   Every family owns at least one car, 
 a necessity to get anywhere and most  
 youngsters learn to drive as soon as  
 they are 17 with only a handful of    
 women unable to drive. The only public
 transport is a Postbus from/to        
 Llandrindod Wells in the afternoon at 
 an impractical time and really only   
 used by tourists for a scenic ride.The
 nearest railway station is 15m away.  </content>
