		<title>19CORN MILL, YSTRAD</title>

 1633)                                 
   The Corn Mill - a focal point in    
 local history - was probably set up by
 the Cisterian Monks of Penrhys who up 
 until the early 14th century farmed   
 sheep on their land.  The wool would  
 have been taken to the Tonypandy      
 Fulling Mill for washing whilst the   
 harvested corn would be ground into   
 flour at Ystrad.                      
   The mill was situated in what was   
 known as the Home Hamlet (as in the   
 1844 Tythe Map).  The old mill wheel  
 can be found at the bottom of Penrhys 
 Road in front of St. Stephen'S Church.
  When Baptist Churches were being     
 established, members were baptized in 
 the Mill's water.  Mill Street, Ystrad
 commemorates the Mill.
