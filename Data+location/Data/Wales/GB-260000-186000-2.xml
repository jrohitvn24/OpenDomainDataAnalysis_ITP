		<title>02Fawn-tagging at Margam Park</title>
		<content>   J3Y and Clase went to Margam park in
 a coach.When we stopped we got out of 
 the coach and put on our wellingtons. 
 We started to go through the bracken. 
 There were lots of grass snakes.I     
 thought I saw an adder.Then I saw a   
 fawn and I ran after it through the   
 boggy part and I was soaking. Then    
 Cyrelle and I went into the bush and  
 saw the baby fawn.Then we all went    
 deeper into the heart of Margam       
 Park.A girl found a 3 day old fawn    
 which was beautiful and very          
 frightened, with the most lovely      
 birthmarks I have ever seen. We went  
 deeper and deeper into the heart of   
 Margam and found 2 other fawns. Every 
 fawn we found had its ear tagged with 
 a red tag to say that it was born in  
 1985.When each fawn was tagged it     
 gave a high-pitched squeal.Then we had
 lunch with Clase school.Victoria Moore</content>
