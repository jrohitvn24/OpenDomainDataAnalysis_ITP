		<title>02AMMANFORD - SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content>  Ammanford is quite a small town, yet 
 it is the main shopping centre of the 
 Amman Valley.                         
  The town has four hairdressers, six  
 clothes shops, three chemists and six 
 restaurants and cafes. Many of these  
 shops have opened in the last five    
 years, but "Evans the Chemist" is an  
 old establishment. There are three    
 butcheries and three bakeries serving 
 the area, along with two newsagents,  
 two hardware and one D.I.Y. store.    
  The area's wealth may be reflected in
 three electric appliance stores, three
 jewellers and computer and video shops
 found in the town. Ammanford also     
 boasts two sports shops, five shoe    
 shops and two travel agents. Recent   
 additions are a Chinese take-away and 
 an Indian restaurant.                 
  Derelict houses are also being       
 refurbished for business in Wind St.  </content>
