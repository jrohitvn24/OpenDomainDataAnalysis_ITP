		<title>13FORESTRY COMMISSION_PEOPLE</title>
		<content> In 1984 1000 acres were lost. If fires
 start the fire service is called in or
 the foresters use their own helicopter
 which carries water from the lake and 
 tips it where the fire is worst.      
    There are 30 workers in this       
 forestry district but a maximum of 4  
 at Tair Onen. only 1 of the 30 is a   
 woman. Forester Williams who showed us
 around, has worked for the forestry   
 comission for 20 years &amp; has to change
 forests every 10. His hours vary. He  
 usually works from 7am to 10 pm and   
 must therfore live nearby.            
      There is a nature reserve. Foxes,
 squirrels &amp; badgers are protected but 
 rabbits are shot if they attack young 
 trees. There is a lake with many      
 different sorts of fish, wild ducks   
 &amp; moorhens. The lake has a weed       
 problem so grass carp have been       
 introduced to keep it clear.          </content>
