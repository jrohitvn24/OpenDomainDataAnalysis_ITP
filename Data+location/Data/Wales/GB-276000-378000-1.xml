		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF AREA.</title>
		<content> Our area  covers both sides of the    
 Conwy estuary.To the West lies the    
 Morfa,a sandy waste,devoted mainly to 
 golfing and summer caravans.To the    
 East are the residential areas of     
 Deganwy,Llandudno Junction and        
 Llanrhos.The early municipal housing  
 estates were built to alleviate       
 overcrowding in the town of Conwy     
 while much of the private housing was 
 for retired people mainly from the    
 North of England.However,recently,    
 young families have begun to move into
 housing once thought the preserve of  
 the elderly.Private development is    
 continuing.The new link road to       
 Llandudno will reduce traffic on the  
 present roads and preserve this as an 
 essentially quiet tree-lined suburban 
 area.The residents look towards       
 Llandudno as its main centre for      
 shopping and services.                </content>
