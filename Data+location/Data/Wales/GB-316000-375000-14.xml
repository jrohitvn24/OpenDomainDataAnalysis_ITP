		<title>14HOLYWELL'S EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>{Service industries}associated with    
 retailing and local government offer  
 the main employment opportunities in  
 the Holywell area. The town was once a
 market town serving the agricultural  
 hinterland. Small-scale{manufacturing 
 is represented by the old-established 
 woollen mill and Hall's soft-drinks   
 factory situated in the Greenfield    
 Valley. The impending closure of the  
 Courtaulds textile mill at Greenfield 
 indicates the decline of major        
 manufacturing,this will increase the  
{unemployment}rate of 18%. Holywell    
 has become a{dormitory town}with many 
 people travelling to work outside the 
 area. Among employers are the Vauxhall
 car plant at Ellesmere Port, British  
 Aerospace at Broughton and small-scale
 manufacturing units being established 
 along the coastal strip since the     
 closure of steel making at Shotton.   </content>
