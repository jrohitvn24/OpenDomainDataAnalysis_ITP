		<content> Mrs.Carol Bradley moved with her      
 family to Cwmfelin from Birmingham 13 
 years ago.She has lived in the same   
 house Bradley Stores ever since.A     
 friend reccommended the village as a  
 pleasant place to live.Since then     
 Carol says Cwmfelin has got worse it  
 has become rougher with most          
 children's facilities such as the     
 baths and cinema closed down.Carol    
 said that people have to shop outside 
 the village for their weekly shopping.
 Trips to the large supermarkets in    
 Newport,Pontllanfraith and Caerphilly 
 have to be done mainly by car as there
 is only one bus service.Mr.Bradley is 
 a long distance lorry driver and feels
 Cwmfelin is lacking after travelling  
 to so many different places.The       
 Bradley family car is a Datsun Sunny  
 used for Sunday outings and for       
 getting to work.                      </content>
