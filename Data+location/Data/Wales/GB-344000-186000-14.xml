		<title>14The Severn Tunnel Band</title>
		<content> This Brass Band was started fifty     
 years ago by men working at the Severn
 Tunnel Junction. We rehearse at Green 
 Lane Junior School and at "The        
 Haywain".                             
    The uniform which we wear for      
 concerts and competitions consists of 
 black trousers or skirts and specially
 made jumpers and blazers.             
    Many of the young members of our   
 band were taught to play by our       
 conductor, Mr. Ron Cummings.          
    We enter many competitions at      
 places such as Crosskeys, Swansea,    
 Treorchy and Stroud. In October 1984  
 we entered a competition at the Royal 
 Albert Hall. We didn't win because the
 standard was very high but we all     
 enjoyed playing in such a magnificent 
 Hall.
