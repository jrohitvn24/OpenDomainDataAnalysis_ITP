		<content> We play{Postman}on a hot day. Everyone
 sits in a circle. Then one person     
 takes a skipping rope and walks or    
 runs round the outside of a circle.   
 Nobody in the circle is allowed to    
 look behind them. The person with the 
 rope drops it behind someone. When the
 rope has been dropped you may look be-
 hind. Whoever has the rope behind them
 picks it up and runs round in the     
 opposite direction. The last person to
 reach the empty place is the next     
 postman.                              
{Queeny Ball behind the Wall}is a game 
 for three or more children. The person
 who is on it turns away from the rest 
 of the players. Someone has a rope and
 hides it on themself or someone else. 
 The person on it turns round and says 
 who has the rope and where it is hid- 
 den. If wrong 'he' tries again, but,  
 if right,the one with the rope is'he'.</content>
