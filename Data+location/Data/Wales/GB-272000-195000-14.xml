		<content> The Headmistress of Melin Infants     
 School.                               
 Mrs.Jenkins of Melin Infants School   
 gets up at 7-30a.m. She gets to school
 by car.She usually leaves the school  
 building at around 4-00p.m. The       
 facilities that she uses in the Melin 
 are the Post Office and some shops.She
 thinks that Melin people care about   
 their schools and education.The number
 of children in the school has remained
 stable.They do not have a P.T.A. but  
 mothers often come in to help.The     
 things she wants to change are the    
 nursery playground and she would like 
 an area of grass for the children to  
 play on.She said that the school used 
 to be for children between the ages   
 of 11-14 and then it was an Adult     
 Education Centre before it became an  
 Infants School.
