		<title>19CHILDREN'S PASTIMES, SWANSEA</title>
		<content>   The favourite pastime is watching   
 television. 85% of the children said  
 that they spend 3-5 hours viewing each
 day. Video films are popular but      
 owning a video recorder is kept secret
 in case it is stolen. 46% of the      
 children play computer games, but only
 5% have educational programmes. Infant
 children play lots of 'let's pretend' 
 games, usually based on TV programmes.
 25% say that they play lots of tag and
 skipping games. Older boys play foot- 
 ball all year round. There are no     
 local clubs so boys have to leave the 
 area to join teams. Only 20% of the   
 children belong to organisations like 
 Brownies or Cubs. There are no groups 
 like these in the immediate area. Only
 30% go out of the area for leisure    
 activities. Most children hang around 
 the roads or our school buildings. We 
 all wish we had a club to go to.      </content>
