		<content> The little village of Pontsticill has 
 decreased considerably in importance  
 since it's prime years in the 1800's. 
 The village used to have two chapels  
 and one church,now only the church in 
 Vaynor is in use.There used to be a   
 Post Office and also a shop,but they  
 closed down a few years ago because   
 they were not being used enough.Today 
 the children of the village have to   
 travel three and a half miles to the  
 nearest school.The old village school 
 closed down many years ago because    
 there were too few children.          
           Now there only three pubs in
 the village,they are the Red Cow Inn, 
 the Butcher's Arms and the Church     
 Tavern.It is called the Church Tavern 
 because it is right next to Vaynor    
 Church.In Pontsticill itself there is 
 a popular riding school with fifteen  
 horses.                               </content>
