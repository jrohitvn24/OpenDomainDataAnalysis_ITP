		<content>   In the past,the main form of trade  
 was fishing in The Irish Sea,but since
 these waters are being used illegally 
 by certain European countries,it has  
 resulted in fewer fish being available
 for the Conwy fishermen.              
   The other main form of fishing in   
 the river is the catching of          
 mussels,but this decreased in recent  
 years.                                
   The other main form of trade is     
 tourism,with many thousands of        
 tourists visiting each year.Due to the
 number of tourists visiting,there are 
 a large number of gift shops,resulting
 in a smaller number of services.      
   There are,however,a few chain stores
 to be found in the town.Most shops are
 family businesses,normally going back 
 for many generations.
