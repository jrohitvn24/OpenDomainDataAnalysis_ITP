		<title>18Being unemployed</title>
		<content>  During my working days I had to be up
 at 6.30,now that there is no immediate
 rush I am up for 8 o'clock.My day in  
 general starts by taking the children 
 to school,one{of life's pleasures that
{I had not experienced before.         
  On returning home I go to see my     
 mother,who lives just round the       
 corner.Then I go to town on three     
 separate days to do the bulk of the   
 shopping.When the sun shines I        
 garden;wet weather sees me doing odd  
 jobs about the house.                 
  Then it is time to fetch the children
 from school.I{don't have much time to 
{be bored,having}                      
 hobbies like gardening                
 and wine making to keep me going.So   
 being unemployed means simply having  
 more time on your hands to do the     
 things you enjoy and complete jobs you
 weren't able to before.               </content>
