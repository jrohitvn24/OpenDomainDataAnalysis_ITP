		<content> Upper Hill Park Estate is situated    
 to the south of the grid reference,   
 there is a residential area, fairly   
 densely populated.It is made up of    
 several parts _ Hill Park ; Upper Hill
 Park,Lady Park and Seascape.          
  Having made a survey of the area,we  
 found that Lady Park,situated at the  
 top of the estate on high ground is   
 made up of mainly detatched bungalows 
 with a few houses.                    
  Upper Hill Park and Seascape also    
 consists of a mixture of bungalows and
 houses.                               
  At the end of the Croft is now a     
 modern block of flats totally         
 unrelated to the Victorian houses.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
