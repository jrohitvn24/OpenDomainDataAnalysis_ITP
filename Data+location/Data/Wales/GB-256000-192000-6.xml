		<title>06DUNVANT MALE CHOIR</title>
		<content> The exact date of the formation of the
 choir is unknown but it was during the
 last quarter of the last century and  
 was formed,in the first place,from the
 male section of Ebenezer Chapel Choral
 Society.It has flourished ever since  
 and to-day has in the region of one   
 hundred members.Practices were held   
 weekly in the Vestry of Ebenezer      
 Chapel until 1972 when the growing    
 number of members necessitated the    
 seeking of larger premises.Practices  
 are now held in Gowerton Comprehensive
 School,a mile or so away.             
   Apart from being very successful in 
 eisteddfodau (choral competitions),the
 choir has given numerous concerts,    
 locally and nationally, in aid of     
 charities.In recent years the choir   
 has built up an international         
 reputation as a result of tours in    
 countries such as Germany and Canada. </content>
