		<content> The oldest houses in Tumble are       
 Terraced, they were built very quickly
 and cheaply by the Mining Company who 
 had opened the Great Mountain         
 Colliery. The houses were built on    
 either side of the main road and very 
 close to the mine. These houses have  
 now been modernised and bought by the 
 occupiers. By 1910 there were 263     
 houses (adult population 1 389) and   
 Tumble more or less was as it is      
 today, except for the eight Council   
 Estates and private homes that have   
 been built since then and the Second  
 World War. The majority of the houses 
 are semi-detached, especially the     
 council houses. Many of the council   
 houses have been bought by the        
 families who lived in them. Most of   
 the privately built houses are        
 detached bungalows and are owned by   
 the occupiers.                        </content>
