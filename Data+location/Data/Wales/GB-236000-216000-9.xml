		<content> There are two places or worship in the
 block, Llanllwch Church and Smyrna    
 chapel.  In this day and age there are
 some residents who do not attend a    
 place of worship with any regularity, 
 a few attend chapels or churches      
 outside this block, while others      
 attend the above named places or      
 worship regularly, but who live       
 outside the block.  Llanllwch is a    
 small well kept church of             
 approximately 200 members.  The       
 average attendance on an ordinary     
 Sunday is 70. The services are mainly 
 English, with a little Welsh included,
 but once a month one communion service
 is entirely in Welsh.
