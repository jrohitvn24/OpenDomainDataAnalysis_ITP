		<title>04Bus services-Llanhari area</title>
		<content>  The area surveyed is served by three 
 bus services operated by National     
 Welsh Bus Company.These services      
 operate between Cardiff and the       
 Rhondda Valleys,Pontypridd and        
 Porthcawl and Talbot Green and        
 Cowbridge. Together these provide a   
 half hourly service in the Talbot     
 Green and Pontyclun area,with an      
 hourly service to Llanhari and        
 Llanharan.                            
  A questionnaire survey was undertaken
 at Talbot Green Bus Station.          
  Half of the people questioned thought
 that the bus service was adequate, but
 some thought that half an hour was to 
 long to wait wait between each bus.   
 A high percentage of those questioned 
 thought that the bus fares were       
 reasonably good value but some people 
 thought that they were too high for   
 old age pensioners.                   </content>
