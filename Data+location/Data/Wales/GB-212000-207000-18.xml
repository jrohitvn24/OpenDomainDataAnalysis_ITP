		<title>18Kilgetty Railway halt.</title>
		<content> This used to be a station and the old 
 Co-op building stood nearby and used  
 the station for receiving farming     
 materials.  Farmers brought sugar beet
 and other crops to be loaded.  2 years
 ago Clifford Jenkins managed a Farming
 Co-op nearby but Clynderwen Co-op     
 became more powerful and no Farming   
 Co-op remains.  Trains run from       
 Pembroke Dock through Tenby to        
 Whitland where they join the main line
 to London. Only very few passengers   
 use Kilgetty Halt.  Verity's brother  
 sometimes comes home from Greenhill   
 Secondary School, Tenby and gets off  
 at the halt.  A new bridge had to be  
 built to take the railway over the by 
 pass.  It was put up in one evening by
 very large cranes.
