		<title>19Politics in Glanaman area.</title>
		<content>    Traditionally this area is a       
 stronghold of the Labour Party and    
 regularly returns members of this     
 party as council representatives in   
 the three different tiers of local    
 government- the Cwmaman Town Council, 
 the Dinefwr Borough Council and the   
 Dyfed County Council.                 
    The only other party of note in the
 area is Plaid Cymru, the Welsh        
 Nationalist Party. Locally this party 
 is supported mainly by people who have
 a great interest in Welsh culture and 
 traditions.                           
    This year the sitting Labour       
 councillor on Dyfed County Council was
 not re-selected by the local branch of
 the Labour Party as its candidate, but
 he decided to stand as an Independant.
 In a three-cornered contest he        
 defeated the Official Labour Candidate
 and the Plaid Cymru Candidate.        </content>
