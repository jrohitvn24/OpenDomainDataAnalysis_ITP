		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY THE  RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The first type of railway in Govilon  
 was the old tramroad,which was opened 
 in 1922.It ran from Nantyglo Ironworks
 down to the Wharf at Govilon.The owner
 of the tramroad was Crawshay          
 Bailey.Many songs were written about  
 his love of engines.Part of this old  
 tramroad route was absorbed by the    
 Merthyr,Tredegar and Abergavenny      
 Railway in 1859.The railway was used  
 to transport goods and passengers.It's
 coming brought a decline in the       
 usefulness of the canal and           
 tramroads.At it's peak it was a       
 valuable source of employment,for at  
 least one third of the Govilon        
 population worked there.The line      
 closed in 1958 and parts of the old   
 track have been made into Nature      
 Trails.
