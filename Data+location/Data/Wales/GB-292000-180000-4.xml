		<title>04COITY CHURCH REPAIRS</title>
		<content>   Last year the Church roof was       
 falling off so the builders started   
 to put on new slates. The church is   
 600 years old and has been in our     
 village all that time, while the      
 church roof was being put on the      
 church services were held in the      
 church hall. Our church holds a Sunday
 school for the children in the        
 village. The church roof took 5 months
 to repair and cost Â£70,000. On Easter 
 Sunday the church was repaired. People
 are very pleased now that they are    
 back.  Church services  start at nine 
 thirty in the morning and finish at   
 ten forty-five. Sunday school is after
 church in the church hall.
