		<title>05Llanddulas school.</title>
		<content> Our school is a new building,opened in
 1975 by Mrs.Lyons,S.R.N.,on the site  
 of the old Boys' School.We are a cont-
 rolled school,under the Church of     
 Wales,since money for the first Ysgol 
 Llanddulas came from the church.The   
 Girls' school opened around 1864,and  
 in 1941 the 2 schools were joined.The 
 Girls' school became the dining hall. 
 Today it is a private house,and David 
 and Anthony Howe live there.          
    We have a lovely hall for P.E. and 
 lunches and services,a mobile class-  
 room for an infant class,and a sports 
 field.We have good football and net-  
 ball teams,and this year we won the   
 Athletics cup.We are planting seeds in
 the grounds,and we are starting a nat-
 ure trail for Environmental Studies.We
 have four teachers in school,and Mrs. 
 Griffith takes the morning Nursery.
