		<content> In the village of Mochdre there are   
 other industries.There is the {Diamond
{Stylus}which is quite well known for  
 making stylus' for record players.With
 the coming of the compact disc player 
 we wonder about the future of such an 
 industry.                             
 Another famous industry in Mochdre is{
{J.K.Smit &amp; Sons(Diamond Tools)Ltd.}   
 This company makes diamond core cable 
 bits for rotary core drilling.These   
 bits are at present being used for    
 several site investigations for the   
 proposed immersed tube tunnel under   
 the Conwy Estuary.J.K.Smit's Technical
 Director John Holden commented"As a   
 North Wales company ourselves,we are  
 delighted that we have been able to   
 play a part in this interesting       
 project which is so important to      
 communications along the North Wales  
 Coast."                               </content>
