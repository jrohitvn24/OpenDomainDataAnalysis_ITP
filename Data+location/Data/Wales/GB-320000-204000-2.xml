		<content> Transport and communication in our    
 area is served by road and rail.      
                                       
 The railway,part of the old G.W.R. ,is
 now used only for mineral working and 
 heavy goods to Roseheyworth Colliery. 
                                       
 The main road link is the A467        
 Newport_Brynmawr trunk route.This     
 follows the lower eastern side of the 
 valley and passes through Abertillery.
                                       
 The valley is served by the National  
 Welsh bus company and by the local    
 firm of Henleys',which runs buses to  
 Cwmtillery,Blaenau Gwent and          
 Brynithel.The area also has several   
 coach hire firms and three taxi       
 services.                             
 Lorries deliver the majority of goods 
 while most families have a car as the 
 most convenient method of travel.     </content>
