		<title>15ORIELTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The School was opened with 40         
 children on Monday 15 December 1873.  
 The first master was Mr. John Crisp.  
 The school was apparently given its   
 name because of close ties with the   
 local Orielton Estate, whose owners,  
 the Saurin family, may have donated   
 the land.                             
 In the years following, up to the     
 present, 8 men have been Headteacher. 
 Mr. Clifford Davies has held the post 
 since 1972.                           
 Altogether 37 men and women have      
 taught as Assistant Teachers at the   
 school since it was opened, not       
 including 11 Supply Teachers and 7    
 Part-Time Teachers. On its registers  
 are details of 2087 pupils. Originally
 an all-age school, the pupils now     
 attending are all between the ages of 
 4 and 11+.
