		<title>11Housing in Caerhun Parish</title>
		<content> There are few new houses, most being  
 traditional country dwellings built of
 rubble and stone - 'tyddyn' or farm,  
 'bwthyn' or cottage, 'hafodty' or     
 summerhouse - which blend into the    
 landscape. Bryniau and Tyddyn-y-coed  
 are 17th century examples. Caecoch, at
 1260 feet, is said to be the highest  
 occupied cottage in North Wales. Most 
 homes are owner-occupied. Many have   
 mains water but householders are res- 
 ponsible for their own septic tanks.  
 Modernisations, e.g. extensions, damp-
 proofing, double-glazing, insulation  
 and well-planned kitchens transform   
 old houses into attractive homes with 
 fine views. Some farmhouses are sold  
 separately when farms become vacant.  
 Most homes have well-kept gardens     
 and small orchards. Pride is taken in 
 possession of Welsh dressers, chests, 
 clocks and the 'Cwpwrdd tridarn'.     </content>
