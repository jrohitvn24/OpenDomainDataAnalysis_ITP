		<title>20Pontycymer in transition</title>
		<content> Pontycymer today represents a         
 community in transition.  The sequence
 of pit closures has continued since   
 the First World War, resulting in     
 unemployment, out-migration, a low    
 standard of living and an inadequate  
 provision of amenities.               
 "How Green Was My Valley" could have  
 been written about this area, as the  
 harsh economic ENVIRONMENT was        
 lessened by the miners themselves, but
 as industry has retreated, it's scars 
 are being hidden, and the old         
 community spirit has been restored, so
 that the new greenery is being matched
 by a more optimistic attitude.        
 Thanks are recorded to Mr L.V. Kelly, 
 Miss C. Griffiths, First and Second   
 Year Pupils of Pontycymer and         
 especially to Karl Bibey and Paul     
 Brain for unstinting efforts.
