		<title>16Community Police.</title>
		<content>  In the past a Police Constable was   
 stationed here. He lived in the police
 house in High St.and patrolled the    
 district keeping law and order. Now we
 have two community policemen stationed
 at Pencoed, so they have a bigger area
 to patrol.                            
  P.C.Hammond and P.C.Smith spend much 
 time here and are very active in the  
 life of the village. P.C.Smith visits 
 the school often and teaches cycling  
 proficiency to the older children.    
 Both policemen are very kind and      
 helpful and we like them very much.   
 They arrange visits to the police     
 museum, games etc. and are always     
 making sure we are safe.              
  Sadly, P.C.Smith has been posted to  
 Bridgend and will be leaving us soon. 
 We will miss him very much but will   
 give a warm welcome to his successor.
