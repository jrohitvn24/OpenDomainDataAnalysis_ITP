		<title>07Pembrey Country Park</title>
		<content>  Close by our village is the{Pembrey  
{Country Park.}It opened officially on}
 July 31st, 1980. The Park is          
 approximately 6,000 acres of forestry,
 beach, sand dunes, grassland and salt 
 marsh. It is a beautiful place where  
 people come for peace, enjoyment and  
 relaxation. About 350,000 visitors a  
 year come to the Park - some from as  
 far away as Brazil, but most people   
 come from Llanelli and Swansea.       
   There are many interesting pursuits 
 for visitors-a small railway track, an
 adventure playground,a trim track,pony
 trekking, nature trails, orienteering,
 camping, exibitions and the beautiful 
 beach and forest. Many animals can be 
 seen rabbits, hares, foxes, squirrels 
 and numbers of different birds.       
   It is very difficult to imagine now 
 that for many years this lovely area  
 was used as a Royal Ordnance Factory. </content>
