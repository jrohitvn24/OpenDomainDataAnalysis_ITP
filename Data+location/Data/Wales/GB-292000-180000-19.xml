		<content>      Many children in school keep pets
 and it is important for them to know  
 how to care for them properly. Pets   
 need regular feeding and exercise and 
 they must have a comfortable place to 
 rest.                                 
      A survey was taken in school to  
 find what pets or small animals were  
 kept by our pupils. The results are as
 follows:-                             
         Cats          l4%             
         Dogs          32%             
         Gold fish     26%             
         Rabbits       l0%             
         Farm animals   2%             
         Budgerigars   l0%             
         Hamsters       4%             
         Other          2%             
      220 children took part in the    
 survey and from the results we can see
 that dogs are the most popular pet.
