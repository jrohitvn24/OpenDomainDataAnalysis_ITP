 The only lake in the block is called  
 "Llyn Helyg" which lies 587 feet above
 sea level. It is approximately half a 
 mile long by a quarter of a mile wide.
 It is an artificial lake privately    
 owned by Lord Mostyn, Mostyn Hall     
 Estates, Mostyn, Clwyd, constructed in
 the l7th Century for the purpose of   
 fishing and ice-skating. It is a      
 shallow lake fed by natural springs   
 and formed by a low dam at it's       
 Western end. There are two streams    
 running into it with the surrounding, 
 dense, deciduous wood forming a       
 natural habitat for birds and         
 wildlife.Today the lake is stocked    
 with Perch, Tench, Rudd and Pike      
 with the fishing rights being leased  
 by the Mostyn Estates to the local    
 Holywell and District Angling Club.
