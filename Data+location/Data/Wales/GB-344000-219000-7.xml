		<content>  For the tug of war there were six men
 on each end of a long rope.They were  
 very strong.They had to dig their     
 heels in the grass to stop being      
 pulled over the line and they heaved  
 and strained and pulled on the        
 rope.They were all farmers' sons.     
                                       
  The game of skittles is played on a  
 long board . Nine skittles are placed 
 on the end of the board and you bowl a
 ball towards them.If you hit some     
 down,say six or nine,you get six or   
 nine points.                          
                                       
  To test your strength you had to pay 
 20p for a big hammer. Then you had to 
 bang a little peg with the hammer     
 which made a metal cup-shape shoot    
 up a pole and hit the bell.
