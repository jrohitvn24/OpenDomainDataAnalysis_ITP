 on the site.A safe beach is near by   
 and pets are allowed. There  is a     
 playing area for Children but no      
 swings or roundabouts. This site is   
 closing down.The new road will emerge 
 from a tunnel soon to be built under  
 the Conway River and sweep through the
 caravan site.This is only one change  
 the new road will make to our area.
