		<content> PUPILS ARE ABLE TO JOIN IN MANY       
 ACTIVITIES e.g. RUGBY TEAMS, SOCCER   
 AND NETBALL TEAMS AS WELL AS THE      
 ORCHESTRA AND CHESS CLUB. MEALS ARE   
 PROVIDED IN BOTH SCHOOLS AND AVERAGE  
 OF 55% HAVE THESE MEALS. IN CONTRAST  
 TO THE COED EVA SCHOOLS HENLLYS SCHOOL
 IS OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD HAVING  
 OPENED IN 1878. IT IS A STONE_BUILT,  
 RURAL SCHOOL WITH TWENTY-NINE PUPILS, 
 RANGING FROM 4 TO 11 YEARS OLD, AND   
 TWO TEACHERS INCLUDING THE HEAD       
 TEACHER. THESE NUMBERS ARE STEADY.    
 ABOUT 66% OF PUPILS HAVE MEALS        
 PROVIDED BY THE SCHOOL AT MID-DAY. THE
 CURRICULUM FOLLOWED IS SIMILAR TO THAT
 OF THE MODERN SCHOOLS BUT ITS SMALL   
 SIZE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO RUN SCHOOL 
 TEAMS IN SOCCER,RUGBY OR NETBALL. AT  
 THE AGE OF 11 THE PUPILS TRANSFER TO  
 FAIRWATER COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL.
