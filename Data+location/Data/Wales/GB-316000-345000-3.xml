		<content> The Britannia Inn was once a small Inn
 set between three cottages that date  
 back to the 15 C. Owned by Llantysilio
 Estate untill after the second world  
 war. They were sold to the Williams'  
 in the 1940's and eventually the Inn  
 was extended  taking over  the three  
 cottages. The Inn has changed hands   
 four times,to date the present owners 
 Mr. and Mrs. C.Aston, have done a lot 
 of improvements, and have won many    
 awards for tourism,and 'The garden    
 in bloom' competitions.               
  The Britannia Inn orignally stood on 
 the main road but due to a fatal coach
 crash in 1950, involving a Sunday     
 School party from Chirk, the road was 
 altered giving  more ground to the    
 Inn.
