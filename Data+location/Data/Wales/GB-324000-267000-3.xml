 home at about 6.We have a cooked tea  
 and when the washing up is done we    
 help feed and see to all our animals  
 and in summer we work in the garden or
 help with hay making.In the winter we 
 pulp swedes then we go in and watch   
 television by a nice fire. Then we    
 have milk and biscuits a bath and bed.
