 activities are watching rugby,playing 
 bingo and playing darts and pool.     
 Visiting public houses and clubs are  
 also high on the list of enjoyable    
 activities.Many villages have their   
 own Rugby teams which compete in local
 leagues.Many public houses have their 
 own darts teams (male and female)and  
 also pool teams too.These also have   
 league tables.Pool is a form of       
 snooker.                              
 Watching television is the main       
 activity pursued by almost all the    
 population.This is the most passive   
 entertainment there is,but as there   
 are a variety of programmes people do 
 not get bored.Television provides     
 "company" for lonely people.
