		<content> The houses in Aberaeron were built in 
 the early{19th century}when the town  
 developed around the harbour.The town 
 is expanding so older houses and shops
 are at the the centre and newer houses
 are further out e.g. on Lampeter Rd,  
 Rhiw Goch etc.                        
 The vicarage was built in 1863 and has
 been recently modernized.{Sir Geraint 
{Evans,the famous opera singer}lives in
 Aberaeron in the house built in 1845  
 by John Harris, a local shipbuilder,  
 and the house is now called{Trelawney.
 The older houses are prettier than the
 modern ones and sell better (this was 
 confirmed by the estate agent).       
 Aberaeron is a holiday town and       
 attractive houses are expensive.      
 The typical house is a square layout, 
 emphatic quoins and keystones. The    
 surface is brightly coloured plaster, 
 large windows,and pillared porches.   </content>
