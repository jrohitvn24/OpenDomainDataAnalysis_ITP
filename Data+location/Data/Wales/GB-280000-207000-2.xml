		<content> Blaendulais Primary is the name of our
 school.We have 3 buildings ;a modern  
 nursery/reception unit,an infants     
 department and a junior department.The
 infants building celebrated its       
 centenary in 1983 while the junior    
 building is approximately 90 years    
 old.The campus is shared with the     
 Welsh medium primary school which also
 shares the canteen facilities for the 
 school meals service.There are about  
 214 pupils in our school and most of  
 them lie near enough to be able to    
 walk to school.A small number live at 
 the bottom end of{Seven Sisters}and   
 need transport to school.About half   
 the Welsh primary pupils are bussed   
 from nearby villages.The pupils may   
 attend our school from the age of 3+  
 and leave for secondary education at  
 11+.The L.E.A. is West Glamorgan.
