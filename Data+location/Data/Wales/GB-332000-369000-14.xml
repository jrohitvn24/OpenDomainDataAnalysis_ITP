		<title>14Adults Spare Time - Sealand</title>
		<content> Here are some of the things adults do 
 in their spare time. Well, the most   
 known things that adults do is to sit 
 down and read the paper, make a cup of
 tea or coffee, or watch television.   
 Sometimes they listen to the radio or 
 listen to their records.They often go 
 to the library to get some books to   
 read, or they sometimes read a        
 magazine. Sometimes they smoke        
 cigarettes or a pipe. In the week if  
 they haven't got anything else to do  
 they go to the shop to get something  
 to eat or they sometimes go to the    
 chip shop to get some chips. Sometimes
 they go to visit their friends or go  
 somewhere for a drive in their car.   
 Sometimes, if the weather is nice they
 sit or lie in the garden and sunbathe.
 Sometimes your dad has to go and do   
 some work in the garden like mowing   
 the lawn,digging up roots.            </content>
