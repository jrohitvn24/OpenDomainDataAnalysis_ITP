  This is a small village with a       
 population of 30. There are no buses  
 so the villagers are dependent on     
 their own transport. A school bus     
 pichs up children every day to take   
 them to Raglan junior school. There is
 a pond near the end of the village,   
 fed by a natural spring. The village  
 is a linear settlement.               
  One couple owns 7 acres of land and  
 use some of it as a certificated      
 camping site. They also have a goat, 2
 horses and 2 dogs. In a neighbouring  
 house an alderly retired lady helps   
 the "Disposal and Welfare of Horses"  
 organisation. This organisation helps 
 to find good homes for old or         
 mal-treated horses.                   
  All the villagers live locally or in 
 Abergavenny.
