		<title>07My work in Cardigan.</title>
		<content> Three days a week I drive into        
 Cardigan where I work as a clerk at   
 the Old Oak Insurance Brokers.There   
 are 2 Insurance Brokers in Cardigan   
 but Old Oak is the bigger and longer  
 established office.We have four full  
 time and two part time staff.As       
 Brokers we are agents for             
 approximately twenty Insurance        
 companies.So,for example,when a       
 customer asks for a quotation for his 
 car insurance we are able to compare  
 the rates and cover of several        
 companies thereby giving him a far    
 wider choice than that of an          
 individual Insurance Company.I find   
 the work very interesting as I enjoy  
 meeting and helping people.My time is 
 spent attending to customers,giving   
 quotations,taking premiums and        
 operating the computer.We have 4 VDU's
 and a printer which is a great help.  </content>
