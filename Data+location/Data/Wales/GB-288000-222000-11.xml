		<title>11FARMING,THE CNEWR COMPANY</title>
		<content> At some time between 1853 and 1859,   
 Joseph Claypon granted a lease on the 
 farm land to Robert McTurk (1833-1916)
 who farmed it until his death as the  
 CNEWR COMPANY.  In the 1860's he      
 bought other hill land and in 1891 the
 original Crown Allotment was also     
 conveyed to him. This increased the   
 total area of the farm to about 12,000
 acres (4,800 hectares).  The estate   
 has remained within the same family   
 since that time.Although it seems that
 Cheviot sheep had already been introd-
 uced by Christie, local tradition has 
 been that McTurk brought the first of 
 the Cheviot breed to the area.        
 Certainly he added considerably to    
 their numbers. At that time he had to 
 drive the flock all the way through   
 the Welsh borderland from Crewe, in   
 Cheshire, which in the 1850's was the 
 nearest point on the railway to Cnewr.</content>
