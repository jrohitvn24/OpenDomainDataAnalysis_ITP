		<content> It is interesting to see a more       
 liberal  attitude towards clothes.This
 is especially so in the case of       
 teenagers and young adults.It is      
 common to see many varied fashions    
 being acceptable amongst the same     
 peer group.                           
         Males are not as conservative 
 in their dress and it is now common   
 for young men to dye their hair,wear  
 jewellery and even wear forms of      
 makeup.                               
     It is common to see many groups   
 dressed in similar or near identical  
 clothing e.g. punk rockers,motorbike  
 enthusiasts.                          
          Young teenagers especially   
 girls have taken to "dressing up"     
 during all leisure time.Their dress,  
 especially footwear, being non-       
 conducive for "rough and tumble" type 
 playing.                              </content>
