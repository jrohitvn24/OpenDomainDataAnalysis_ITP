		<content> Tourists come to our block in order to
 visit the {Black Mountain.} From the  
 top of the mountain you can see to the
 North the historical ruins of Carreg  
 Cennen Castle.  To the South you can  
 see (on a clear day) as far as the    
{Swansea Bay}and out to the{Port Talbot
{Steel Works.}                         
 All traffic traveling from the South  
 in order to get to the mountain must  
 pass through our block.  The main     
 route from the South Coast is the {   
{A4069}which passes through the Eastern
 end of our block.                     
 Apart from these impressive mountain  
 areas and their views of the          
 surrounding countryside there is      
 little of interest to the tourist     
 around our block.
