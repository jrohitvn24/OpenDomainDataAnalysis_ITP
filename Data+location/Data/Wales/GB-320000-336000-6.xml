		<title>06THE PONTFADOG OAK.</title>
		<content> The oak tree is on Cilcochwyn farm    
 land,which is in Pontfadog.The tree is
 hollow in the middle due to its very  
 old age.It is said to be the oldest   
 oak tree in the British Isles,older   
 than a thousand years.It is a Sessile 
 oak and in 1966 it was in the Guinness
 Book of Records as having the largest 
 girth of an oak tree at 42 feet and 9 
 inches.Some time ago a section fell   
 off so it is no longer in the book of 
 British records.                      
 In 1984 a tree preservation order was 
 placed on it,as in the opinion of     
 Clwyd County Council, and the local   
 people it is worth looking after.
