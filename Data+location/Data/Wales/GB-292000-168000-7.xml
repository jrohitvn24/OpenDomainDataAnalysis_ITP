		<title>07Heritage Coast</title>
		<content>  The area that we studied falls under 
 the Glamorgan Heritage Coast.This is  
 an area of coastline selected for its 
 natural beauty,which stretches from   
 Aberthaw in the east, to Newton in the
 west, and extends a mile inland.Now   
 that most people drive cars,the coast 
 of Britain is invaded by millions of  
 holiday makers every year.To protect  
 and preserve the coast,certain areas  
 of it were designated heritage coast  
 areas.                                
 The Glamorgan coast was the first to  
 be opened in 1973.Certain points on   
 the coast were opened up and improved 
 and people were encouraged to go there
 by the opening of large car parks and 
 footpaths.This would leave other areas
 with certain rare flowers and animals 
 free from human interference.They are 
 patrolled by wardens and most of the  
 work is done by volunteers.           </content>
