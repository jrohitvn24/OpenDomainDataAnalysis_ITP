		<title>05Sea Fishing at Llanelli.</title>
		<content>  Fishing in Llanelli is fair all the  
 year round,but there is not a large   
 variety of fish to be caught.Fishermen
 go out on boats and some do a lot of  
 shore fishing.Some people come to     
 Llanelli for fishing holidays,and all 
 fishermen report that the catches are 
 improving in size and quantity.       
  Shore fishermen have a variety of    
 plaice,flounders,sand dabs,bass and   
 the odd few whiting in winter.        
  With a boat you can catch a much     
 wider variety of fish.A typical       
 fishing trip would catch              
 flounders,rays,skate,bass,whiting,cong
 er eels,plaice,dabs,gurnard and       
 several species of dog fish such as   
 spotted dogs,spur dogs and            
 smoothhound.Tope and small porbeagle  
 sharks have also been caught.You are  
 better off with a boat for fishing in 
 Llanelli.                             </content>
