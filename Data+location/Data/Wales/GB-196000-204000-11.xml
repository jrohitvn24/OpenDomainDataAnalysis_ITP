		<title>11AN ADULT'S DAY IN BURTON</title>
		<content>   On a normal day I rise at 5.30 a.m.,
 get my bag ready for work, and let the
 dog out into the garden. For breakfast
 I have coffee and some muesli.        
   I  drive to work getting there about
 6.40a.m.. I am a{Process Operator}at  
 the{Gulf Oil Refinery}at Milford      
 Haven. This involves grading and      
 testing petrol. Sometimes I work in   
 the control room where there are lots 
 of computers and machinery to         
 operate.I finish work at 7.00 p.m. and
 when I come home I have a meal, read  
 the newspaper, then take the dog for a
 walk. Sometimes I play cricket with my
 son. If there is local cricket match I
 like to watch.                        
   Later in the evening I have a bath  
 and watch television.                 
   At approximately 11.00 p.m. I       
 usually have a cup of cocoa and go to 
 bed.                                  </content>
