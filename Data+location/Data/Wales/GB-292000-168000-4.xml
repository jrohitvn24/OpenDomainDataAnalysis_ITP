		<content>  At Atlantic College there is a       
 programme for extra mural activities. 
 This programme has been organised to  
 help young people who are handicapped 
 and those who are at risk in the      
 community.During 1984-5 efforts to    
 make the social work teams in Mid     
 Glamorgan familiar with Atlantic      
 College were doubled.The Intermediate 
 Treatment group took part in a four   
 day sailing expedition from Falmouth. 
 A donation from Allied Steel will     
 enable ten similar projects to take   
 place.                                
  David Jones who joined the staff in  
 1984 has organised a very successful  
 residential youth training scheme for 
 young people with hearing             
 difficulties.There will be an         
 International Deaf Youth Rally in     
 1985.Trainees have built a climbing   
 wall at the pool for the handicapped. </content>
