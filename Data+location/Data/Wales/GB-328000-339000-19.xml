		<title>19WELSH LANGUAGE</title>
		<content> WE LIVE IN WALES. WALES HAS ITS OWN   
 LANGUAGE. IN OUR VILLAGE ONLY A FEW   
 PEOPLE SPEAK WELSH,AND, WE ONLY SPEAK 
 IT WHEN WE HAVE LESSONS. ROAD SIGNS   
 AND OFFICIAL LETTERS ARE IN WELSH AND 
 ENGLISH. THE WELSH LANGUAGE IS HARD   
 BUT I LIKE IT. IN MY SURVEY, MOST     
 PEOPLE LIKE THE WELSH LANGUAGE AND    
 THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT DIE OUT, ALTHOUGH
 NO-ONE SAID THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK  
 IT ALL THE TIME. THE FIRST LANGUAGE OF
 ALL PENTRE CHILDREN IS ENGLISH, THOUGH
 THREE CHILDREN DO HEAR WELSH SPOKEN AT
 HOME. THE WORD 'PENTRE' IS REALLY     
 WELSH FOR VILLAGE. THESE ARE MEANINGS 
 OF SOME WELSH PLACES IN OUR AREA:     
 CEFN BYCHAN...SMALL HUMP.             
 TY MAEN..STONE HOUSE                  
 COEDLEOEDD..PLACE OF TREES.           
 CEFN_Y_WERN...BACK OF THE MARSH.      
                                       
                                       </content>
