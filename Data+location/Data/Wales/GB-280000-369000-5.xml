		<title>05The Eglwysbach Show</title>
		<content> The biggest event in Eglwysbach is    
 the Eglwysbach Show which is always   
 held on the second Saturday in August.
 The success of the Show all depends on
 the weather. This year it was warm.   
 They started putting up the poles on  
 the Monday before the Show. There are 
 many visitors from the big towns like 
 Birmingham and Manchester who come    
 here. There are lots of sections,     
 for example, the Children's section,  
 flower section and cakes section.     
 There are lots of animals, sheep and  
 cows shut up in pens as well as       
 ponies, horses and shire horses.      
 This year, in the main ring, there was
 a fancy dress competion with children 
 on their ponies, including one dressed
 up as a postbox and another as a      
 knight. There was also a fire show,   
 tractor driving competion, riding and 
 gymkhana, and a fun fair.             </content>
