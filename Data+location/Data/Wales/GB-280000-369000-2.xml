		<title>02Amenities in Eglwysbach</title>
		<content> In Eglwysbach there are two garages.  
 One belongs to Jacksons and the other 
 to John Jones. There are two shops and
 one is called Gaynor's but it is also 
 known as  Stanley House. The other    
 shop was called London House but it is
 now called the Post Office. The       
 nearest supermarket is at Llanrwst or 
 Llandudno. There is a village hall in 
 Eglwysbach which is used for barn     
 dances and discos and lots more       
 things. The village has got a bus     
 service and a taxi service but there  
 is no train service. The church is    
 called St. Martin's Church and was    
 built more than five hundred years    
 ago. The first vicar was called David 
 and he came here in 1537. There is one
 public house in the centre of the     
 village, The Bee, but in the olden    
 days there used to be four.
