 village centre. In the 1930's a       
 village hall was built by the Walker  
 family of Bod-Hyfryd.Later it was     
 changed into a cafe owned by the Reid 
 family.In 1981 it was turned into the 
 British Legion.In 1983 an extension   
 was built.                            
   The Valentine pub is in the old     
 village near the Church.It is now     
 owned by Mr.Kerr and his wife.They    
 have been there one year.The Valentine

 certificate.The pub was built in 1872 
 which makes it the oldest pub in
