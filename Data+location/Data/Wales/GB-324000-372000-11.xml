		<title>11Places of interest in Flint</title>
		<content> The 1610 map by John Speede shows the 
 town of Flint as a rectangular shape  
 surrounded by defence banks called    
 dykes. Today the rectangular street   
 pattern can still be seen in the old  
 part of the town and the street sign  
 saying{Castle Dyke Street.}The town   
 has a great deal of local history. We 
 made a town trail in class showing    
 some of the interesting places to     
 visit. It included the old{Town Hall, 
 built in{1839,}which has a beautiful, 
 old{Council Chamber}containing many   
 historic civic treasures. Next is the 
 site of the{Roman Villa}at Pentre and 
 the{Druid's Stones.}Then{Cornist Park 
 with its hall and golf course, and, in
 contrast, we have the modern{Leisure  
{Centre.}Finally, Flint has an{ancient 
{castle,}built in 1284 by Edward 1,    
 which is well worth a visit.
