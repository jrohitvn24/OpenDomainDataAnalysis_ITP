		<content> The water from Penuwch Fawr fields    
 drawn into the Paith forming its      
 source. The stream has been helped by 
 entrenchment, making it grow in       
 confidence to eventually emerge       
 through a boggy copse of willow &amp;     
 alder, where the cuckoo sings in      
 spring, to the Llanfihangel-Pantycrug 
 road. It runs under the road &amp; falls  
 fiercely into a pool the otherside &amp;  
 continues through the open well kept  
 fields of Nantybenlog. The Paith      
 increases in volume, although not in  
 size, due to modern field drainage    
 techniques employed by the farmers.   
 The variegated small pebbles of       
 different shapes together with many   
 white stones on the banks &amp; in the    
 stream show the mark if water erosion 
 through the ages. From here the stream
 adopts a more meandering nature &amp;     
 flows towards Nantyrhudd.             </content>
