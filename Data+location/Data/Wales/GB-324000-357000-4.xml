		<title>04Transport-Leeswood area</title>
		<content>  On average 19 buses pass through     
 Leeswood in a typical day.The buses   
 go to or come from Mold and Wrexham.  
 Treuddyn does not have so many buses; 
 it has only 12 passing through a day. 
 The buses are either single-deckers(42
 seats) or double-deckers(72 seats).   
 Although they run almost hourly they  
 are rarely full exept on Saturdays.   
 The majority of people apparently     
 prefer to use their own transport;most
 families own at least one motor car.  
  In addition to the scheduled services
 of the National bus company,the       
 district  has two privately-owned bus 
 services operating on a casual or     
 contract basis.                       
  There was a railway but it is now    
 derelict,having been closed in 1950.
