		<title>15Transport Taff's Well</title>
		<content> The Taffs Well settlement is aligned  
 NW to SE, along the axis of the       
 transport system. The south west      
 part is predominantly industrialised. 
 In comparison, the north west consists
 mainly of woodland and rough pasture. 
 In the SW area there are two railway  
 lines, one now dismantled, providing  
 evidence of the former importance of  
 the extractive industries.  The main  
 Cardiff-Merthyr roads complete the    
 transport pattern.   A new housing    
 estate has been developed between the 
 rail axis and the road axis, possibly 
 to accommodate employees of nearby    
 works in the south and west of the    
 area.
