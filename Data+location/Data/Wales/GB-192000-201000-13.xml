		<content> their cars available for people to    
 use  where there is urgent need and   
 for essential shopping etc.at a small 
 fee.When asked about shopping problems
 he told us that in the main there were
 no serious problems but being in such 
 a specialised trade he did have       
 related difficulties such as obtaining
 special canvasses and woods for       
 framing,and these he had to obtain by 
 post.With normal shopping items he    
 said that there were certain problems 
 which forced him to make a special    
 trip to Carmarthen about once a       
 month.Like most countrydwellers he    
 grows all his own fresh produce for   
 which purpose he owns about 1/2 acre  
 of land.When asked about pets he told 
 us that he had three large guard dogs 
 because of the risk of being broken   
 into due to the remoteness of his     
 home.                                 </content>
