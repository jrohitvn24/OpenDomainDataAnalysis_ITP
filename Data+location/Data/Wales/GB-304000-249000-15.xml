		<title>15THE ROYAL WELSH SHOW</title>
		<content> Every year in late July,the Royal     
 Welsh Show comes to its permanent site
 at Llanelwedd,just outside Builth     
 Wells.Nowadays,the show lasts 4 days  
 though for many years previously,it   
 only lasted 3 days. At one time,      
 Wales' premier agricultural show had  
 no permanent site and,each            
 year,travelled around the counties of 
 the Principality. In 1963 it was      
 decided to site the show permanently  
 in Mid-Wales as the cost of staging   
 a "travelling" show was proving too   
 great. Before the Royal Welsh came to 
 Llanelwedd,the highest 3-day          
 attendance was a little over 40000    
 whereas,in 1985,more than 52000       
 attended on the Wednesday alone and   
 the total 4-day attendance was 175953.
 On most years, a member of the Royal  
 Family attends the show.   {
