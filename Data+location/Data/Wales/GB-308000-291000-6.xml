		<content> K.T.K. which manufactures electronic  
 testing equipment are already         
 established on the site.The Board is  
 currently responsible for a shopping  
 development in Broad Street.          
       One of the projects undertaken  
 by the Board is the building of       
 St.Mary's Close on the site of the old
 tannery,which moved in 1981 to a new, 
 modern tannery on the Pool Rd..       
 St.Mary's Close is on the banks of the
 River Severn and is close to the town 
 centre.49, one or two bedroomed       
 flats,and 13 maisonettes have been    
 built at St.Mary's Close.The occupants
 are either young married couples or   
 old people.The buildings have been    
 built in traditional red brick.       
 St.Marys Close is very important      
 because it improved the looks of the  
 town and brought people back to live  
 in the centre of the town.            </content>
