		<title>01Llanddulas,past and present.</title>
		<content>  Our survey area is a mixture of hilly
 countryside,and built-up areas like   
 Penmaenrhos and Llanddulas.It is also 
 by the seaside.Important features are 
 the A55 main road,the new Expressway, 
 and the Llanddulas limestone quarries.
 The roads are important because this  
 part of N.Wales is a tourist area.    
 There are many holiday chalets and    
 caravan sites here.The Hotel 70       
 Degrees is spectacular,on the edge of 
 a cliff overlooking Colwyn Bay.       
 The quarries are two huge holes in the
 local limestone,right by the road,with
 ships visiting 2 jetties for stones   
 and gravel.Many Llanddulas people work
 in the quarries.                      
  Llanddulas village is very old,sit-  
 uated in the valley of the River Dulas
 where it joins the sea.There is a     
 large new estate,as many people have  
 moved here for work and to retire.    </content>
