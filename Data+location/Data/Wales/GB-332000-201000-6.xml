		<title>06TRAFFIC AT LITTLE MILL</title>
		<content> The A472 is a very busy single        
 carriageway from Pontypool to Usk.    
 Lorries, buses and cars travel to a   
 nearby Defence Establishment and it is
 also used as a link road to the A4042.
 The effect of the heavy traffic upon  
 the infrastructure of this narrow road
 is causing concern.There is a speed   
 limit of 40m.p.h.through the built_up 
 area, but this certainly does not     
 deter some drivers from exceeding the 
 limit.                                
 The public bus service has been       
 drastically curtailled to three buses 
 per day with returns.The local        
 education authority provide private   
 buses for transporting children to    
 several primary and secondary schools 
 in adjoining villages and towns.
