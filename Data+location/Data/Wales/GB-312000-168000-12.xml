		<content> On monday I get up at 7.45am and go   
 downstairs to breakfast.  For my      
 breakfast I have cornflakes or        
 shreddies.  A cup of tea or an orange 
 drink.  After breakfast I wash, dress 
 and brush my teeth.  by the time I    
 have seen to my hair it is 8.30 m.  I 
 leave home for school at 8.45am where 
 I arrive at 8.55am.  There are two    
 school sessions 9am to 12 noon. and   
 1.15pm to 3.45pm.  After the second   
 session I make my way home to watch   
 television and have my tea.  For tea I
 have beans on toast or sausage and    
 chips with cake afterwards.           
 folllowing tea I play with my friends 
 or watch television.  At 8.45 pm I go 
 to bed.
