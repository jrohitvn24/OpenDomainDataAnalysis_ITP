 On Friday morning I get up at 8 a.m., 
 I have a wash and get dressed. Then I 
 have some cereal or toast for         
 breakfast. At 8.45 a.m. I leave for   
 school.                               
 In school we have an assembly and then
 a spelling test. At 10.35 a.m. we have
 play for 20 minutes. This is followed 
 by Maths ( or English ) until 12 which
 is lunch time.                        
 I have sandwiches for lunch.          
 In the afternoon, which begins at 1.30
 p.m., we have Music followed by an art
 lesson ,which lasts for the rest of   
 the day until 4 p.m.                  
 Then I go home and watch T.V. before  
 having tea at 5.30 p.m.               
 I watch T.V. until bed time at 11 p.m.
