		<title>16Penygawsi Estate Survey 1</title>
		<content>      The children of Penygawsi Primary
 school conducted a door to door survey
 of the estate around the school. The  
 following facts were discovered:-     
{                                      
{ 69%}have lived here 1-9  years       
  {7% }"     "    "  16-22   "{        
{                                      
{ 34%}moved here from  1-6  miles away 
{ 31% } "    "     "  10-12   "     "  
                                       
 These facts help to show that the     
 estate is a "young" one (the majority 
 of houses have not been built long) It
 is popular because people with local  
 knowledge have chosen to live here.   
 The people who have moved here from   
 10-12 miles away have come from the   
 Cardiff area or the Valleys.The       
 Cardiff people may have moved to avoid
 the high cost of housing whereas the  
 Valley people may have come for jobs. </content>
