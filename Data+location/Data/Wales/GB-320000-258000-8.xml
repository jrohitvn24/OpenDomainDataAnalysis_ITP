		<content> LAMBING STARTS ABOUT MID MARCH. FEW   
 CALVES ARE BORN THEN AS MOST ARE BORN 
 DURING THE AUTUMN. AFTER LAMBING IS   
 COMPLETED THE SPRING CORN IS SOWN.    
  THE SHEEP ARE PUT OUT ON TO THE HILLS
 AT THE END OF MAY, BUT IN LATE JUNE OR
 EARLY JULY THEY ARE AGAIN GATHERED IN 
 TO BE SHORN AND DIPPED,AND THEIR LAMBS
 ARE DRENCHED, BEFORE BEING ONCE AGAIN 
 RETURNED TO THE HILLS. THIS IS        
 FOLLOWED BY HAYMAKING  AND SILAGING.  
 DURING SEPTEMBER COMBINING TAKES PLACE
 AFTER WHICH THE FIELDS ARE READY FOR  
 THE AUTUMN CORN.                      
   AT AUTUMN TIME THE LAMBS ARE        
 FATTENED AND SOLD.                    
   DURING DECEMBER THE SHEEP ARE ONCE  
 AGAIN BROUGHT DOWN TO LOWER PASTURES  
 WHERE THEY ARE FED UNTIL MAY
