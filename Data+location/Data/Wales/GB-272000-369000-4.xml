		<content> Church and Chapel attendance is a     
 custom in this area and there are many
 associated festivals such as Harvest  
 Festival or Thanksgiving or           
 Diolchgarwch as it is called in Welsh.
 A singing festival, Cymanfa Ganu,     
 still has great appeal.               
 It is a custom for friends and        
 neighbours to visit bereaved families 
 to offer sympathy and help.           
 A village Carnival is held annually in
 July and a supervised bonfire on      
 November 5th to celebrate Guy Fawkes  
 is still a popular custom.            
 Among the children the Hallowe'en     
 customs of witches, making turnip     
 lanterns and playing 'bob apples'     
 still prevail. On New Years Day       
 children call at houses chanting      
 'Calennig' or 'Blwyddyn Newydd Dda' - 
 'Happy New Year' - and receive a small
 gift.                                 </content>
