		<content> A Northop woman is so impressed with  
 the treatment she is receiving from   
 Liverpool's Walton Hospital that she  
 is organising a round of fund raising 
 activities to buy medical equipment.  
 Mrs. Pauline Wakley of Rhos y Chellis 
 Farm broke her neck in a car accident 
 twelve months ago. As a result she    
 underwent a complicated operation at  
 Walton's Neurosurgical Unit where bone
 was grafted from her hip to the       
 damaged vertibrae.She said," While I  
 was recovering I realised just how    
 much the hospital was doing for Clwyd.
 Anyone from this area who suffers  a  
 severe head injury has to rely on     
 Walton a tremendous amount".Mrs Wakley
 still has to wear a surgical collar   
 but is hoping to get back to work on  
 the farm when it is removed in August.
 At present she is organising an appeal
 for the hospital.                     </content>
