		<title>15HOUSING IN PLASMARL, SWANSEA</title>
		<content>   Plasmarl is made up mainly of       
 terraced houses all neatly standing   
 row by row. They are quite old, made  
 of stone with slate-tiled roofs. Many 
 people are now having extensions built
 to their properties to make them      
 larger. They are also brightening them
 up with paint or pebbledash and new   
 front doors and windows (mainly double
 glazing).                             
                                       
   Most houses have no front gardens   
 but usually have a big back garden in 
 which the old outside toilet stands.  
 Most of the houses are built on the   
 hillside, with steep roads leading up 
 to them.                              
                                       
   Newer houses are built on the       
 outskirts of Plasmarl, most of them   
 bungalows.                            
                                       </content>
