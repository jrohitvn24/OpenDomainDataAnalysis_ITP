		<content>  The block is in a Welsh speaking area
 but less than twenty five percent of  
 the inhabitants of the district speak 
 Welsh and are therefore bi-lingual.   
 Some of the people are able to        
 understand Welsh but are unable to    
 speak or write the language. The      
 children are taught Welsh in Primary  
 School and some of them go on to a    
 Welsh Secondary School where all the  
 teaching is done through the medium of
 the Welsh language. In this respect   
 some of the children are bi-lingual   
 whereas their parents are not. As more
 English speaking only people move into
 the area the Welsh language is used   
 less and it is feared that unless     
 greater effort is made to learn Welsh 
 it will eventually become extinct in  
 the area.
