		<title>01SUMMARY OF THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content>{      LANDSCAPE:BUILDINGS:}Semi-rural 
 area with evidence of long occupation,
 certainly for 2000 years. There are   
 Iron and Bronze Age camp and burial   
 sites. Industrialisation with a       
 variety of extractive industries has  
 changed the landscape. Buildings vary 
 from stone cottages to modern houses. 
{      ECOLOGY:}The weather is Atlantic
 Maritime with cool summers mild       
 winters. Plant life is mostly         
 deciduous with coniferous plantations.
 The built environment is a balance of 
 new houses and factories and          
 dereliction of old industries and     
 railways.                             
{      EMPLOYMENT:}5% are engaged in   
 farming, mining and quarrying, over   
 30% in factory work but many commute  
 by car to office jobs etc. elsewhere.
