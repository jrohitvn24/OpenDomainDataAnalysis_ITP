		<title>08A NOTABLE EVENT</title>
		<content> The most notable event in our locality
 recently was the building of an       
 extension to the local village school.
 The work was commenced in August 1985 
 and completed in December.The original
 school was built in 1896.When the     
 education committee improved all the  
 schools in the area during the fifties
 and sixties,Swyddffynnon was on the   
 closure list,with only 11 pupils and  
 1 teacher.But local opposition kept it
 open,and numbers increased gradually  
 to secure its future.However the      
 school missed out on modernisation.   
 Now brand new inside toilets and a    
 staffroom have been built.There is a  
 long corridor and spacious cloakroom  
 and even an attic to store books.There
 are 3 store cupboards to keep books,  
 and a place of her own for the        
 caretaker.The staff have their own    
 toilet.It will be open in January 1986</content>
