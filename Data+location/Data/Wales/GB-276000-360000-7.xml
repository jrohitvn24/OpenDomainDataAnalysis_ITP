		<content> Farming is an important part of life  
 in the block. It consists mainly of   
 sheep farming,although some herds of  
 beef cattle are also raised. The sheep
 graze the less productive hill land in
 the summer and are brought down when  
 necessary for the winter or market.   
 Much of the valley land is used for   
 grazing or the raising of crops for   
 silage. The land is subject to        
 flooding which makes it very fertile. 
 Fisheries:                            
 Glan Gors lake is being stocked with  
 salmon at the rate of 18O per month.  
 They are brought from a fishery in    
 Scotland. Some fish are later taken   
 from the lake to be smoked and sold.  
 Fisherman pay Â£27 per day, Â£175 per   
 week,and Â£7OO per 3O week ticket to   
 fish the lake. Fishing rights apply in
 the local rivers.
