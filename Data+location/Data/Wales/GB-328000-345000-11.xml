		<title>11Law and order in Rhos</title>
		<content> The new police station was built in   
 1984 in Market Street.It is easy for  
 people to go there. In the police     
 station there are four cells. In our  
 school there have been about fourteen 
 breakins. We had our school video and 
 tapes stolen.We went to the police    
 station on a project. The man we met  
 was P.C.Williams(he has been in the   
 police force 22 years) he took us     
 around the station with Johnstown     
 school. We asked him a few questions  
 about the police station. Were Rhos   
 police aloud to break the speed limit?
  "Only in an emergency".At the station
 there are two sargeants,seven         
 constables and a girl on reception.   
 Ten police men were based there       
 altogether. They had four patrol cars 
 .We asked P.C.Williams if he used his 
 truntion."Only a few times with       
 violent prisoners",came the reply.    </content>
