		<content> Most people walked to work.Farmers had
 cars.Some workers had motor           
 bikes.People walked to Boncath to     
 catch the train to Cardigan.Food was  
 plain.Vegetables were homegrown,butter
 and cheese from the cows and          
 home-baked bread.Nearly everyone kept 
 a pig and a cow.Children made up their
 own games or played cards,dominoes and
 draughts.House games were few.There   
 were only 5 or 6 large families,but   
 more people lived in the district.    
 People worked long hours.In their     
 spare time they went to the youth     
 club,concerts or Eisteddfodau.Few went
 on holiday.The roads were poor.There  
 was no tar on the minor roads.Council 
 workers looked after 3 miles of roads 
 and hedges.The shops sold everything  
 from nails to shoes.People only had a 
 radio.Welsh programmes were few.There 
 were 2 batteries,1 wet and 1 dry.     </content>
