		<content>  Mr Jones remembers children's poverty
 being measured by the degree of       
 protrusion of their ribs. The picture 
 of undernourished children queueing   
 for a spoonfull of cod-liver oil still
 haunts him.Clearly the miners and     
 their families were sustained by the  
 degree of community spirit.           
  Valley children had little           
 educational oppertunity at the turn of
 the century. However the miners sought
 to improve their own knowledge, and   
 burning with a fierce determination   
 that their childrens should know a    
 better life, opened institutes,       
 libraries, clubs, societies supported 
 with voluntary contributions from     
 their pay(1 penny per week)           
  Two World Wars, women earning the    
 second income in munitions factories  
 changed the life of the village.
