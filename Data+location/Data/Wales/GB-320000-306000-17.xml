		<title>17WELSHPOOL TOWN COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The 13 members of the Council hold    
 their meetings once a month, plus     
 committee meetings. The council is    
 split into three committees which deal
 with, the Town Hall, the Recreation   
 Ground and the Armoury Sports Centre. 
 There is a market held on the lower   
 floor of the Town Hall with the upper 
 floor being rented out for discos and 
 fund raising. On the Recreation Ground
 is the cricket club and football      
 pitches while the Armoury houses the  
 squash courts and sports hall. The    
 Council are also trustees of the      
 Burgess land on which they have       
 already built some houses.            
 To raise money for the events that    
 they sponsor they take a proportion of
 the household rates. Some areas of    
 expenditure are met by the Montgomery 
 District Council.
