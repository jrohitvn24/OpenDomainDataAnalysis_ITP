		<title>12THE GOTHIC STYLE</title>
		<content> The Gothic style houses in Marford    
 first appeared in the early 1800's.   
 Features included rusticated trellis  
 work at their entrances and also      
 blocked up windows to avoid taxes.On  
 all of the houses the window and door 
 heads are arched over with what is    
 known as the "ogee curve."            
  Another feature of the houses were   
 the plain crosses left in the         
 brickwork or stone. These can be      
 explained by local superstition. A    
 tradgedy occurred when one of the     
 villagers died in dubious conditions. 
 The death put numerous villagers in   
 fright. All the houses were covered   
 with crosses to keep away the ghost of
 the dead woman, which several         
 villagers claimed to have seen.
