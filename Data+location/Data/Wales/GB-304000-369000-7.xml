		<content> Today we interviwed a blacksmith whose
 name is Tony Rogers.                  
 He has lived in Trefnant for about 7  
 years. In an average day they can shoe
 as many as 7 horses, and in an average
 week about 35 horses. He said if he   
 wasn't a blacksmith he would like to  
 be a stonemason or a thatcher.        
 Th eman who owned the Smithy before   
 Tony was Mr. Thomas. He owned the     
 Smithy for 50 years.                  
 He said it cost about Â£16.50 for 4    
 shoes including VAT.                  
 The Smithy was built before the last  
 Domesday  Book was written.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
