		<title>16Biography Of Famous Artist</title>
		<content>  Almost all his paintings describe    
 mining life around the 1920's.Mr.Evans
 rarely chooses comfortable poses.He   
 mostly works on deploreable conditions
 e.g.cramped positions,disasters,      
 lockouts and the soup kitchens.       
 Religous atrocities against the Jews  
 is also one of his favourite subjects.
    Mr.Evans was not taught how to     
 paint.He devised his own unique design
 and has used it ever since.           
    Mr.Evans frequently gives lectures 
 at universities and has very little   
 recreation.In his spare time he       
 exercises "Sheba"his yellow labrador  
 dog.                                  
    His "works of art"have been        
 received by numerous stately homes and
 museums including The National Museum 
 of Wales and the Duke of Devonshire's 
 house.Some of his paintings have been 
 received in the U.S.A. and Europe.    </content>
