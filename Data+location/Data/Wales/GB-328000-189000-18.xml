		<title>18Malpas Area Shops</title>
		<content>      The Malpas area supports a large 
 number of{shops.}There are no fewer   
 than five shopping areas of more than 
 five shops. These range from the      
 largest and oldest concentration near 
 Crindau to the new{purpose-built}units
 serving both private and council      
 housing estates.                      
  Out of a total of 79 shops, 25 were  
{food shops}although we found many{    
{Newsagents}and{garages}selling food.  
   Trade in many of the food shops in  
 the Crindau area seems to have        
 suffered since a large{superstore}    
 opened nearby.                        
{  Non-food}shops totalled 26 while the
 remainder consisted of {Post Offices,}
{Newsagents,Betting Shops,Garages}and{ 
{Public Houses.}We found only 8 public 
 houses in the area but there were 12  
 shops with {off-licences.}
