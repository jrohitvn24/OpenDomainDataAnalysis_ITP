		<content> The provision of a sound education for
 their children is a top priority for  
 most parents. Cil-y-cwm primary school
 built in the last century has a       
 teaching staff of one headmaster and  
 one teacher. Of the 34 pupils, only   
 five are from Welsh speaking homes.   
 The decline in the number of Welsh    
 speaking pupils has accelerated during
 the past 10 years. Older pupils are   
 conveyed by bus to Llandovery         
 Secondary School, 4 miles             
 away.Educational activities organised 
 by the W.I., Y.F.C. and Agricultural  
 Training Board are much in demand.    
 These include general knowledge       
 quizzes, lectures nature walks and    
 various demonstrations.               
 The local piano teacher gives lessons 
 to 40 pupils and there is a long      
 waiting list.Towy Valley assoc conduct
 nature walks,talks on ecology etc.    </content>
