		<content> The Parish{Church}of St. Cyfelach,    
{Llangyfelach.                         
                                       
 Ynystawe is in the parish of          
 Llangyfelach. We went to visit the    
 church in our school minibus. We went 
 along the M4{motorway.}It took us six 
 minutes. Many years ago a {fair}was   
 held there and stalls put on the grave
 stones. It would have taken two hours 
 to walk there from Ynystawe. The      
 school log book for March 1879 says   
 children had a day off to go to the   
 fair.                                 
                                       
 At Llangyfelach Church the tower is   
 not part of the church. The old church
 collapsed and a new one was built from
 a nearby barn. Behind the tower is a  
 Celtic Cross. It is from the tenth    
 century. Some of the grave-stones are 
 carved in Welsh and some in English.  </content>
