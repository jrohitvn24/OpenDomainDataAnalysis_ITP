		<title>14USE OF THE LAND</title>
		<content> Below the tree line the area was      
 originally woodland.From our study we 
 observed that on the valley sides this
 is still the case,but the land above  
 80m has been cleared and used for agri
 culture.This must have originally     
 occured over two hundred years ago.The
 "Cilshafe" group of farms (97 36)are  
 known to be over two hundred years    
 old.Llanwern farm (97 34)is also known
 to be of a similar age.The pattern of 
 the fields as seen from map evidence  
 and observation was found to be one of
 fairly small paddock type pastures    
 which have altered little over the    
 past centuries as the original dry    
 stone walls now covered with          
 vegetation,still exist.We found that  
 the large fields were used for cereal 
 growing whilst the smaller            
 paddocks were used as nursery paddocks
 especially during lambing time.       </content>
