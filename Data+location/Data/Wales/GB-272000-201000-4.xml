		<content> I get up at 07.30, dress and have a   
 breakfast of cereal, toast and tea.   
 My father takes my brother and I to   
 school by 09.00.  When the bell rings 
 we enter the school, answer our names 
 for the register and then assemble in 
 the school hall for prayers and hymns.
 During the morning I do my work, and  
 have playtime in the yard, playing a  
 game of 'England Ireland' with        
 friends.  At 12.15 I have a school    
 dinner of chips, meat with rice and   
 squash to follow.  In the afternoon we
 return to class to do more work, have 
 another playtime and at 15.30 we go   
 home.  At home I play Lego with my    
 brother or draw or read and do my     
 homework.  For tea I have cauliflower 
 cheese, baked potatoes, peach slices  
 and cream.  I watch television until  
 20.30 and then wash, brush my teeth,  
 comb my hair and go to bed.           </content>
