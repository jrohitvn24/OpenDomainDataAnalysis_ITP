		<title>14Special day in Oystermouth</title>
		<content>      I woke up and remembered it was  
 the day of the annual "Womble". After 
 breakfast I went to meet the rest of  
 the group at the "Big Apple" in       
 Limeslade Bay.                        
    Our group was clearing the litter  
 on Mumbles Hill. When at work we found
 an air-raid shelter used during the   
 war.                                  
    At our Womble we ask our friends   
 and relatives to sponsor us to tidy up
 the area. The money we earn goes      
 towards buying something special for  
 the school.                           
    We left Bracelet Bay at 12 o'clock 
 wearing our Womble Badge for 1985.    
 This badge was our pass to the        
 barbecue organised by the parents for 
 the Womblers at Rotherslade Bay.
