		<title>01THE HOLIDAY RESORT OF RHYL</title>
		<content>   Rhyl is a seaside resort on the     
 North Wales coast easily reached by   
 holidaymakers. It is about 30 miles   
 from the nearest motorway and it has a
 main line railway station.            
   Its sandy beach is 2 miles long and 
 the promenade and streets are flat so 
 it is a good place for disabled and   
 retired people. It enjoys better      
 weather than most parts of North Wales
 so the "WELCOME TO SUNNY RHYL" sign,  
 seen as you enter the town, is often  
 proved to be true.                    
   There are many self-catering holiday
 flatlets and today these are more     
 popular than the boarding houses.     
 Recently a new Sun Centre and Shopping
 Precinct have been built.             
   It is a good starting place for     
 tours into the pretty countryside of  
 the Vale of Clwyd and Snowdonia.
