		<content> There is one cinema within in the     
 block.  The most popular evening is a 
 Friday.  The cinema is within the {   
{Public Hall}building in Brynamman.    
 Five people work within the hall      
 itself.  It is very difficult to keep 
 the cinema open at times.  But the    
 hall is financed by the local miner's 
 Welfare Fund.  The hall itself is very
 important as it is the last in Britain
 to be financed in this way.           
 The hall is also used for the{        
{traditional Chapel Eisteddfod}every   
 year and will be used in the future   
 for the Welsh language{Drama Festival.
