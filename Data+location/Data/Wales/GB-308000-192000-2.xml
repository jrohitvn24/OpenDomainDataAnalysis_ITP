		<content>   From 1887 to 1966 the Albion        
 Colliery was the main industry in     
 Cilfynydd.Its closure led to more     
 commuting of workers,some to other    
 collieries but many to manufacturing  
 and service industries closer to      
 Cardiff and the main lines of         
 communication out of South Wales.     
   In the 1980's more local employment 
 was created by reclaiming the old     
 colliery site and building factory    
 units on the land.                    
   A survey in 1985 revealed that the  
 new units had many similarities:90%   
 were indepedent of any other          
 company;70% were involved in services 
 such as repairs with only 20%         
 in manufacturing.South Wales was the  
 main market for all of them;80%of them
 employed less than 10 workers,none    
 more than 50.Good road access was     
 given as the reason for the location. </content>
