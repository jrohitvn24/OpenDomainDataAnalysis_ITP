		<title>17THE NEYLAND RAILWAY (1)</title>
		<content>   In{1852}it was decided that there   
 should be a railway to connect{London 
 with{Pembrokeshire}to start a cross   
 channel service to Ireland.           
                                       
   The{South Wales Railway Company}had 
 the choice of either connecting the   
 line to{Neyland}or{Goodwick.          
                                       
   Eventually,{Neyland}was chosen.     
 In{1835 Neyland}was a small fishing   
 village of about 300 people, but great
 changes were about to be made.        
{Isambard Kingdom Brunel}was in charge 
 of the project. He built 1st., 2nd.   
 and 3rd. class waiting rooms, a       
 booking hall and a post office in{New 
{Milford}or{Neyland.}Also there were   
 cattle pens, coal hoists and          
 fishstages. A magnificent hotel was   
 built for Irish ferry passengers to   
 stay in.                              </content>
