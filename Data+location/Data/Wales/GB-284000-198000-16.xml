		<content> Many of the footpaths in the area have
 been fenced in by the local farmers   
 who have taken advantage of E.E.C.    
 grants to fence land that for years   
 was left unfenced. The local council  
 have also left many eye-sores with    
 their policy of demolishing old       
 houses. Most of the land around the   
 village is either forest or heath and 
 there is a lot of wildlife in the     
 area. The rainfall in the area is     
 generally regarded to be the highest  
 in Glamorgan which is a blessing to   
 the anglers as the river is usually   
 deep. The pollution of the river has  
 also ceased since the closure of the  
 mines in the area.
