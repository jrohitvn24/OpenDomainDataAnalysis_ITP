		<title>02HISTORY OF ABERAERON</title>
		<content> The town of{Aberaeron}had its         
 beginnings in the early 19th century. 
 Although a castle was built here in   
{1148}and the district had been known  
 as Aberaeron, the town itself is less 
 than two centuries old.               
 The modern town dates from{1808}when {
{Alban Gwynne} obtained Parliament's   
 permission to{"rebuild, enlarge,      
{improve and maintain"}the quay and the
 harbour. Then in 1811 he announced    
 that he would{"give liberal           
{encouragement to such persons as might
{be disposed to take building leases   
{near the harbour".                    
 Development from then onwards was     
 swift. An increase in sea trade, and a
 flourishing ship building industry    
 attracted many from the rural         
 hinterland. They brought with them    
 their skills, religions and customs.
