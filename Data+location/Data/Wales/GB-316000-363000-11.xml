		<content> The old buildings of the area were    
 mostly constructed of local stone with
 slate roofs. Some have been occupied  
 for centuries, although many have now 
 been modernized and extended, while a 
 few, like the old village smithy, have
 been converted for residential use.   
 Most new development has taken place  
 in the village, which has expanded    
 greatly in recent years. In 1947 some 
 timber-faced, semi-detached council   
 houses were built for local people to 
 rent: more recently detached houses of
 brick or rendered block-work with     
 tiled roofs have been built for owner-
 occupation and some bungalows have    
 been provided for local pensioners.   
 Little further building will be allow-
 ed,so that the village will retain its
 rural character, and the picturesque  
 old village centre is now protected by
 designation as a 'conservation area'. </content>
