		<content> THE WYNDHAM COLLIERY IS SITUATED IN   
 THE OGMORE VALLEY.  IT WAS SUNK BY    
 JAMES BROGDEN IN 1868 TO PROVIDE COAL 
 FOR THE TONDU IRON WORKS.             
    THE WESTERN COLLIERY ALSO SITUATED 
 IN THE OGMORE VALLEY (NEAR THE WYNDHAM
 COLLIERY), WAS SUNK IN 1887 BY THE    
 OCEAN COAL COMPANY. THE SHAFTS SOME   
 349 YARDS DEEP WERE SUNK TO THE NINE  
 FEET SEAM.                            
    THESE TWO PITS WERE LATER OWNED BY 
 DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THE WYNDHAM WAS SOLD
 IN 1907 TO THE CORY BROTHERS WHO THEN 
 PASSED IT INTO THE POWER DUFFRYN      
 EMPIRE UNTIL NATIONALISATION IN 1947. 
    IN 1972 THE TWO COLLIERIES MERGED  
 TO BECOME WYNDHAM/WESTERN COLLIERY AN 
 IDEA FROM THE N.C.B.                  
    THE WYNDHAM/WESTERN COLLIERY WAS   
 CLOSED IN 1983 AND HAS HAD A SERIOUS  
 EFFECT ON THE ECONONY OF THE OGMORE   
 VALLEY.                               </content>
