		<content> The ancient town of Conwy has long    
 been an obstacle to would-be invaders 
 of the territory of Gwynedd. Modern   
 invaders fare even worse than their   
 predecessors,for Conwy is an infamous 
 traffic{bottleneck}making Gwynedd as  
 hard to leave as it is to enter. {    
 The long-suffering residents look     
 forward to the Conwy River Tunnel as a
 means of restoring the Medieval peace 
 and atmosphere of this tranquil       
 place.The{Castle},built by Edward 1st 
 in 1283, dominates the town which grew
 around it.The walls are an extension  
 of the castle's defences and form the 
 shape of a harp which is appropriate  
 to Welsh folklore.
