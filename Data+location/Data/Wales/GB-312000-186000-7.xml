            As the more modern         
 renovations include heating, lighting 
 and kitchen and cloakroom facilities, 
 the castle is a popular venue to be   
 hired. The cost depends on the type   
 and size of the event: Â£50 for the    
 grounds for half a day and Â£300 for a 
 wedding reception and evening disco in
 the Great Hall. No facility fee is    
 charged for charitable fund-raising   
 events.                               
                                       
            Anyone may hire the castle 
 as long as the occasion is judged to  
 be in the character and tradition of  
 the monument. No visitor may be       
 excluded during normal opening times. 
 In 1984, Â£5,300 was collected in      
 facility fees from the 42 lettings.
