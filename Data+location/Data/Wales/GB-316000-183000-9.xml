 concluded that people lived in the    
 pleasant {dormitory suburb} of Lisvane
 &amp; travelled to work else where. The   
 decline of farming  occured when land 
 was lost to the motorway or was bought
 up for possible future housing        
 development.Some land still used for  
 grazing sheep,cattle or horses.
