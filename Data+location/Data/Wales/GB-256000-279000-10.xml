		<content> came from Scotland.EJ was the most    
 popular registration as it comes from 
 the Bangor area.Most cars were        
 registered in 1981_82 as 'X'.         
                                       
            Colours.                   
   The most popular colours are Red and
 Blue.We think this is so because      
 people like bright colours.Gold and   
 Silver are less popular because they  
 are metallic colours and are more     
 expensive.Black was surprisingly      
 unpopular because we thought it was   
 coming back into fashion.There were no
 Pink cars seen.There were only one    
 Peach and one Grey.We saw six Beige   
 cars going into town from Llabadarn.  
 Yellow was quite popular and so was   
 Brown.
