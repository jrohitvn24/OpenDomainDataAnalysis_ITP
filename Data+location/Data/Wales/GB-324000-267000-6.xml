		<title>06The Village School</title>
		<content> Whitton School has 4l children who    
 come by car and bus -only two live in 
 the village.They come from about 7    
 miles away.About five other village   
 schools have closed and the children  
 come here. We have an indoor heated   
 swimming pool. The school was started 
 in l724 with money from Dame Anna     
 Child who lived near here.Money comes,
 still, from l40acres  that is let out 
 every year and this helps the school- 
 it pays for books,equipment and things
 like trips.It also gives grants to    
 children going to college from around 
 here. The county council pay the      
 teachers and look after the inside of 
 the school. The school is very lucky  
 to have this money- most state schools
 have hardly any money.There is no     
 other school like this one in England 
 or Wales.
