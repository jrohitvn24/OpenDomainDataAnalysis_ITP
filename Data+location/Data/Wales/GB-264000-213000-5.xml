		<content>    Cwmaman Playschool began in        
 Brynseion Chapel Vestry in 1976 and   
 was organised by the mothers. It is   
 now held in the Community Centre, and 
 is attended by up to 32 children      
 between the ages of 2 and 4.          
    The Playschool is held on four     
 mornings a week from 9:30 a.m. till   
 midday. The aim of 'Ysgol Feithrin' is
 to teach the Welsh language through   
 play and song to both Welsh and       
 English speaking children.            
    Funds are always badly needed by   
 the Playgroup to provide both books   
 and toys. Fund-raising events are held
 throughout the year. The children are 
 often taken on interesting trips, and 
 one of the regular events is the      
 annual open day, when parents and     
 others are invited to go along to see 
 a display of the work done by the     
 children.                             </content>
