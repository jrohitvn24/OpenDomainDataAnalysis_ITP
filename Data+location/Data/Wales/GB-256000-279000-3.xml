		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE:R.Edwards.</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7:45 a.m. and went down  
 stairs to breakfast. On the way to    
 school we let a train go past on the  
 railway crossing.School starts at 9:00
 a.m. and finishes at 3:30 p.m.,nearly 
 everyone stays in school for lunch.I  
 had chips,sausage and beans with      
 rhubarb crumble and custard  for      
 pudding.                              
         In the afternoon we had games 
 and Mr. Lloyd played football with us.
 After, we had an art lesson with Mr.  
 John.My favourite lessons are Maths,  
 English and Games.When we got home we 
 watched television for an hour until  
 supper at 6:00 p.m. For supper we had 
 Liver,Bacon and Cabbage,Yuk!!!.After  
 supper Mum read us a chapter of "The  
 Woman in White" by Wilkie Collins and 
 then we went to bed at 9:00 p.m.      
 I read a James Bond novel for an hour.
