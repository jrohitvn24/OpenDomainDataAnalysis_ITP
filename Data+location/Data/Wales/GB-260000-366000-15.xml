         _______________               
 As we live in a rural area we have to 
 travel into town a lot to do our      
 shopping or go to the pictures.This   
 means using the bus a lot,especially  
 if you do not have a car.The buses run
 once every two hours with more buses  
 laid on during the weekend.The reason 
 for a small number of buses is that a 
 lot of people own their own cars and  
 therefore do not depend o             
 n the                                 
 buses.I would use my bike a lot more  
 if there were not so many hills to    
 push my bike up.There used to be a    
 train service from Bangor but they    
 pulled the track up about 30 years    
 ago.There was also a narrow gauge line
 running from the Penrhyn slate quarry 
 to the quay at Port Penrhyn near      
 Bangor but this was also dismantled.  </content>
