		<title>05PENRHYN BEACH LITTLE ORME</title>
		<content> I live on the Penrhyn Beach Estate.   
 The houses round us are nearly all    
 either holiday homes or the people are
 retired so we don't see much of them. 
 One of my neighbours works.           
 Most people near us spend their time  
 in their gardens mowing the lawns or  
 picking out weeds. There aren't many  
 dogs; infact the nearest one is about 
 a quarter of a mile away. There aren't
 many children because most families   
 live in Llandudno. I do like living   
 there because I get away from the     
 noise of Llandudno do my own thing.   
 My parents will probably stay on the  
 estate but I think I will move away.
