		<title>11FARMING IN A  NATIONAL PARK</title>
		<content> Because the  area is situated within  
 the  Brecon Beacons National Park,    
 planning regulations which do not     
 normally affect the erection of argic-
 ultural buildings are in force.       
 Consequently there are few of the     
 modern large lambing sheds which are  
 to be seen in other sheep-farming     
 areas  which make it possible to begin
 lambing  earlier in the spring than   
 if the ewes are out-of-doors.         
 The major problem affecting farming   
 in a national park, which is that of  
 tourist pressure, does not really     
 apply in this area because the number 
 of visitors is comparatively small.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
