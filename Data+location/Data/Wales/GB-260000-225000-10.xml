		<content> Salem and district is administered by 
 Dinefwr Borough Council. The district 
 is part of Llandeilo Fawr, and during 
 the County Council elections of 1985, 
 a   Social  Democratic  candidate was 
 returned for the first time. However, 
 at present the district has no strong 
 political bias.    Salem has a weekly 
 refuse collection.  Plastic bags were 
 introduced at the beginning of   1985 
 for rubbish.(The outer district has a 
 fortnightly collection)               
{Law and Order}      -Irregular mobile 
 patrols were recently  introduced, no 
 permanent police presence in village. 
 the crime rate is almost non existent;
 1 burglary in 1984, first ever.Within 
 the immediate village, irregularities 
 are noted,   and investigated -   the 
 outskirts are not so easily monitored.
      The nearest Police Station is in 
 Llandeilo.                            </content>
