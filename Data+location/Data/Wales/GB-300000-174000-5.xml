		<content>   A typical vale village with between 
 50-60 houses,most of which are 10-50  
 years old though 8 are over 200 years 
 old.The majority of people use it as a
 commuter settlement and use a car to  
 get to work.Most families had 2 cars. 
 Most people work in Cardiff,1 in      
 Cowbridge,4 in Bridgend and 1 travels 
 to London by train.Out of 30          
 households only 4 families were native
 to the vale.Two come from Northern    
 Ireland,1 from Scotland,the rest from 
 England.Only 9 families have any      
 knowledge of Welsh.Only 3 speak it    
 fluently.Trerhyngyll is attractive and
 well-kept.The size of houses and      
 number of cars indicate some wealth.  
    Cowbridge proved to be an important
 local shopping- leisure centre .Many  
 people went to Tesco ,Talbot Green for
 large scale grocery shopping.
