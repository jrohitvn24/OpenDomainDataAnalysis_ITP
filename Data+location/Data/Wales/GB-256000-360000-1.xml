		<content> This area covers Llyn Padarn which    
 runs from south east to north west. To
 the north of the lake are the lower   
 slopes of Elidir Fawr on which lie the
 scattered cottages of Dinorwig between
 ill kept fields close to the slate    
 tips of the old quarry. Beneath this  
 quarry now lies a huge pump storage   
 power station. The remnants of the    
 Snowdonia forest have now been        
 preserved as a country park alongside 
 the lake. This now attracts 100,000   
 visitors a year. To the south west of 
 the lake is Llanberis village with a  
 population of 2000 largely dependant  
 on tourism. It has 4 small light      
 industrial units which provide some   
 employment; but the impression of the 
 village is one of hardship and        
 impoverishment.
