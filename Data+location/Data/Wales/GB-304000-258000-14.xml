		<content> I do not necessarily believe in any   
 deity.I prefer to adopt the Pascalian 
 viewpoint and keep an open mind on the
 subject.However,we are all prisoners  
 of our time and the product of our    
 family backgrounds and social         
 environments.Mine are Welsh working   
 class and Calvinistic Methodist so in 
 many ways I had more difficulties in  
 coping with the challenge of the rel_ 
 tively free and open environment of   
 university.There was an awkward period
 of adjustment during which I was      
 forced to work out a whole new set of 
 criteria in order to cope with the    
 demands and responsibilities of       
 life.This process has continued ever  
 since based upon a healthy scepticism 
 and  spirit of toleration. In 1985,I  
 am most concerned about the threat to 
 world peace,help for poor countries   
 and an end to torture.                </content>
