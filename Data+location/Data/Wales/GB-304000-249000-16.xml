		<title>16ROYAL WELSH SHOW CONTINUED</title>
		<content> Money earned from the staging of the  
 show is largely used to improve the   
 site,repair buildings and roads and   
 to further develop the ground.Each    
 year,one of the Welsh counties is     
 featured which means that the county  
 concerned carries out a special       
 project on the site and stages an     
 exhibition during show week.Each year 
 the show brings hordes of visitors to 
 Builth and this means that shops,     
 hotels and restaurants do very well.  
 In the show itself,one can find       
 something of interest for everybody.  
 There are animals of every description
 including sheep,cattle,pigs,horses and
 dogs. There is a large poultry section
 and rows and rows of machinery,mostly 
 to help the farmers. The main ring    
 is used to stage all  the most        
 exciting events which might include   
 parachute drops and motorcycle display</content>
