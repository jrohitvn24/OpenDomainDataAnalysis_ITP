		<content> In our village there is a Nursery     
 Group for little children, aged 2-3\. 
 The Nursery is in the village hall,   
 called Aberconwy Hall. When they come 
 to the Primary School they start in   
 the afternoon. They then come all day 
 when they are four years old and stay 
 until eleven years old. School starts 
 at 9 o'clock. We have dinner at 12    
 o'clock and go home at about 3.30pm.  
 The school was 150 years old this     
 year. After the Primary School you go 
 to Llanrwst School or Creuddyn School.
 The school bus comes at 8.15am and    
 returns at about 4.15pm. The distance 
 from Eglwysbach to Llanrwst or        
 Creuddyn is about 9 miles and you stay
 in that school until you are 16, or   
 18 if you are really good. Then you go
 to Llandrillo Technical College or    
 Bangor Technical College and there is 
 a bus service to each college.        </content>
