		<content> In Cosheston village there is not much
 provided for leisure. For women there 
 is a weekly keepfit class and the     
 Women's Institute. For the children   
 there are cubs and brownies, all in   
 the village hall, and for the men,    
 a football team. There is a playing   
 field with swings and two Inns.       
     For most of their entertainment   
 and leisure activties, the villagers  
 would do the same as the people of    
 Pembroke. There is a sports centre in 
 Pembroke and many restaurants and pubs
 in the town.                          
     The nearest cinema is 1O miles    
 away in Tenby. There are discos and   
 youth clubs for young people and there
 is a theatre in Milford Haven. There  
 are also many beaches and miles of    
 lovely countryside in the area. Part  
 of the block is in Pembrokeshire      
 National Park.                        </content>
