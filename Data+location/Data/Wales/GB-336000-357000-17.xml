		<content> Lady Jones was a member of the        
 Boscawen family and was born at       
 Hanmer. She married in Gresford Church
 and celebrated her golden wedding     
 there.  Her husband held many         
 distinguished posts and served in     
 both wars with distinction. She       
 returned to the family home Trevalyn  
 Hall in 1955.                         
                                       
 Lady Jones was President of the       
 Rossett Women's Institute and         
 frequently entertained the            
 Denbighshire Historical Society in    
 Trevalyn Hall. In her book about her  
 family she said that 11 generations   
 had lived in the house since it was   
 built in 1560.                        
                                       
 Lady Jones died five years ago at the 
 age of 90.
