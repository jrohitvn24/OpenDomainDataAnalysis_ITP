		<content> Our School was 100 years old in 1975. 
 It is all local stone in the main     
 building which has 5 classrooms and a 
 small library and old toilets at the  
 bottom of the two small               
 playgrounds.The part facing North was 
 built first,then the front facing     
 St.Mary St. was added.Thirty years ago
 a HORSA hut was erected where many    
 other schools sent children to have   
 craft lessons before it became our    
 canteen and another classroom.It is   
 dangerous to cross the road for dinner
 and we have a lady watching us.       
 We can cross over a little bridge to  
 our playing field,the big evergreen   
 trees make it very hot in the summer. 
 I like this building,but we do not    
 have much room in the classes and the 
 high windows mean we can never see out
 and sometimes we do not know it's     
 raining.I don't like the toilets.     </content>
