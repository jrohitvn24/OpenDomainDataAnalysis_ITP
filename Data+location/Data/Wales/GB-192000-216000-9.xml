		<title>09The New By-pass</title>
		<content>      When we went to ask questions at 
{Preseli Dist.Council's Planning Dept. 
 these were some of the things we were 
 able to ask, and so found out about:_ 
      Why are you building another     
 by-pass through Haverfordwest?        
      ...Because of the ever increasing
 amount of{TRAFFIC CONGESTION}at the   
 base of {^ Prendergast Hill ^} We hope
 that this will improve the situation. 
      Will the buildings that are being
 knocked down be rebuilt elsewhere?    
      ...No, I do not think so.        
      Will the by-pass be a short cut? 
      ...No, because it is just about  
 the same distance...but it should be  
{[[[[[[[[[[!!  QUICKER  !!]]]]]]]]]]]] 
 as you will not get held up by slow   
 moving traffic.                       
      Will Bridge Street be affected?  
      ...No, but in the future I think 
 the Council will pedestrianise it.    </content>
