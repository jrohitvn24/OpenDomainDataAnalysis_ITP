		<title>12THOMAS WATKINS OF DEFYNNOG</title>
		<content>  I woke up at 7.30 am. I had 'Start'  
 for breakfast. At 8.40 am. I went to  
 school. I get my pencil case out first
 and put my hymn book in the hall. At  
 9.15am the whistle went for assembly, 
 today it was so boring I nearly fell  
 asleep. After English, topic maths,   
 maths, tables, etc.etc. it was time   
 for play. We had half an hour to eat  
 our dinner and half an hour to play,  
 usually football, touch or cricket.   
 After play we did the Domesday Project
 ..finding things out about Defynnog.  
 The bell rang for last play but we    
 went to change ready for swimming. In 
 swimming we practised breathing. In   
 the free swim at the end of the lesson
 I played with James. At 3.25 I went   
 home and watched T.V. I had tea then  
 watched T.V. again before going to bed
 at 8.00 and reading for an hour before
 going to sleep at 9.00.(27/6/85)      </content>
