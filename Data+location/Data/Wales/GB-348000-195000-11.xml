		<title>11OTTER HOLE The Expeditions</title>
		<content> The first expedition down Otter Hole  
 was lead by George Gardener with David
 Parker.They only got as far the Eye   
 Hole and then they lost the draught   
 they were following.Another expedition
 was arranged ,this time lead by Phil  
 Swarts.They also got as far as the Eye
 Hole.This happened a few times until  
 once they almost lost their lives in  
 the cave because of rising water. When
 they got out they noticed it was high 
 tide in the River Wye. They realised  
 that part of the caves were flooded at
 high tide. Expeditions were carefully 
 planed from now.The next time they got
 past the Eye Hole and found the Hall  
 of 30.Camp was made underground. It   
 took 3 days to clear a boulder that   
 blocked the passage. Once the passage 
 was clear more chambers were found.Now
 the search began for other entrances  
 to the system.                        </content>
