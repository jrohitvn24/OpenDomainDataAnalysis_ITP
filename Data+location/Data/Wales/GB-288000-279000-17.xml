		<title>17LLANGURIG, RELIGION</title>
		<content>  A typical Welsh village which was    
 once strongly religious but now the   
 local churches suffer from dwindling  
 support.                              
  St Curig's Church holds a service    
 every Sunday at 10 a.m. and at the    
 moment has a strong Sunday School.    
  The Ebenezer chapel holds a service  
 every Sunday and only one in four is  
 in English, which must be             
 counter-productive.                   
  The Wesleyan Methodist chapel holds  
 infrequent services.                  
  The congregations in all three are   
 small. There is no resident minister  
 in the village.                       
  The village school belongs to no     
 religious denomination, but readily   
 supports the local churches in        
 charitable fund raising when required.
