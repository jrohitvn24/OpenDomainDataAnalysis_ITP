		<title>19Arts and Crafts at Uzmaston</title>
		<content> Many country women join their local { 
{Women's Institute}to develop their    
 chosen craft or crafts and others are 
 introduced to crafts through compet-  
 -ition and team efforts within the    
 organisation.     At a monthly meeting
 one may be sitting next to an{artist} 
 who paints pictures of the locality or
 perhaps a keen bird watcher who{carves
 birds out of wood, and took a week's  
 course in this subject at Denman      
 College.   A demonstration of{macrame}
 prompted several members to learn this
 ancient craft and one self taught     
 member is now a demonstrator herself. 
 Competition within the organisation   
 demands a very high standard and in   
 order to gain extra marks, courses in{
{smocking, tailoring, embroidery, patch
{-work, upholstery, }and {knitting }   
 have been undertaken by interested    
 members.                              </content>
