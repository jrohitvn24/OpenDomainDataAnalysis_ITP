 the employment is quite varied.The    
 main employment around the outskirts  
 of the town is Farming.The farmers in 
 this area do not employ many farmhands
 as their sons join them on the farms  
 after leaving school at the age of    
 sixteen .                             
    Some men work with{Powys Highways  
 looking after the roads.Others work in
 the local factories and the Mill.Many 
 of the women work in the{Trouser
