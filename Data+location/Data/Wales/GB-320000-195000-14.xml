      Some of these corner shops like  
 Meadow and Pegglers wre the equivalent
 of our CO_OP.They would have their    
 provisions,and have them booked and   
 pay for them when they had their      
 wages.I can never remember having new 
 clothes as we used to go up Dr.Gregg's
 house and he used to give us old      
 clothes or we had hand downs from     
 relatives and friends.
