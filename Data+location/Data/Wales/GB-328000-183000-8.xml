		<title>08Shops on the Estate</title>
		<content> There are several small shops on the{ 
{Duffryn Estate.} There is a knitting  
 shop, a newsagent's shop, a fish and  
 chip shop, a grocery shop and a video 
 shop. We gave some children in the    
 school a questionnaire to ask their   
 parents about{Duffryn shop's.}We found
 that there was not everything at the  
 shop's that people needed. Most people
 didn't like the shop's because they   
 are to far away from their home's.    
 They only went there very             
 occasionally. The shop's were also too
 expensive.{Duffryn shop's}are not very
 popular.
