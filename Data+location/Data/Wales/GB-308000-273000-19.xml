		<title>19TOURISM IN  LLANBISTER</title>
		<content>    Farm tourism started in the 1960's,
 giving income to the farmers wives    
 providing Bed and Breakfast. Staying  
 at farms soon became popular with     
 British and overseas visitors found   
 that the friendly, personal attention 
 provided an opportunity to learn      
 about life on a farm. Home produce    
 and Welsh cooking enhances the appeal.
 A typical breakfast would be cereals  
 or porridge, fruit juice followed by  
 bacon, egg, sausage and tomato with   
 tea to finish. The average charge is  
 Â£7 per night. In 1981 an arts studio  
 was established. Visitors from home   
 and abroad are taught art and textile 
 crafts in the converted stable and are
 accommodated in a guest house on the  
 same site. Courses taught by the      
 qualified owners last from 2 days to 3
 weeks. There is a caravan site in the 
 area for static and touring caravans. </content>
