		<content>   In each ambulance there are two     
 stretchers which carry 8 sitting      
 passengers or two lying down. The     
 stretchers are on wheels and can be   
 raised and lowered,and many other     
 positions to give the passenger the   
 most comfortable ride.There is also a 
 scoop stretcher,which can be split    
 in half,to enable a person with a back
 injury to be picked up without being  
 moved.Ther is a carrying chair to     
 carry people up and down the steps.   
   The ambulance also carries oxgen,   
 ethanox (a gas that kills pain),a     
 breathing machine and an aspirator (to
 suck up blood or vomit).              
   There are also various types of     
 tools for fractures.Each ambulance man
 has his own first aid pack,consisting 
 of bandages,plasters,stethascope,     
 scissors,airways and safety pins.
