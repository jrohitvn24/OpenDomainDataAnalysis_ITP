		<content>    My name is Tracy Goode, I am 11. I 
 got up this morning, 5th June 1985,   
 and went downstairs to drink some     
 coffee. I went through to the bedroom 
 and washed myself. I went upstairs and
 got my pink pants, white and yellow   
 socks, blue jumper and skirt. For     
 breakfast I had cereal. I then started
 to walk to school. The bell went at 9 
 a.m. Samantha and I went in the hall  
 for assembly. We then had maths. At   
 10.30 the bell went for first break. I
 went outside for a game with Samantha 
 and Ruth. We did a couple of English  
 exercises after going back into       
 school. After that I had my dinner. At
 1 p.m. the bell went and we had to go 
 in and do maps. At 2 p.m. the bell    
 rang and we went outside and played.  
 After an hour the bell went for       
 hometime. I got my bag and bike and   
 rode home. I went to bed at 9 p.m.    </content>
