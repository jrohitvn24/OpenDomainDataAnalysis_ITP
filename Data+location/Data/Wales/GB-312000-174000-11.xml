		<title>11LANSDOWNE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>  Yesterday we went to Lansdowne       
 Hospital. When we got there we saw Mr.
 Welsh the Hospital Administrator.  He 
 took us to his office. First of all he
 gave us a map of the Hospital. It     
 looked a very big place. He said they 
 had a nurses home where the nurses    
 stay, for eighty nurses. We found out 
 that it is 19 acres in size. Lansdowne
 Hospital is just a hospital for old   
 people. There is one person who has   
 been there for 24 years. It is a      
 hospital where people stay for a long 
 time. There are 4 wards altogether.   
 The people who work there call the    
 wards houses because they try to make 
 the hospital homely. The four wards   
 are called Ann House which has 25     
 people, Andrew House which has 25     
 people, Elizabeth House which has 28  
 people and last of all there is       
 Charles House,                cont.   </content>
