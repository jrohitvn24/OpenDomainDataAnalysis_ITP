		<content>  A recent survey showed that men in   
 this area mainly spent their leisure  
 time gardening, watching television,  
 do-it-yourself, keeping fit and       
 watching sport.  The women like to    
 read, watch television, sew or knit   
 and keep fit.  The boys had very      
 varied and active pastimes including  
 rugby, cricket, soccer, racquet       
 sports, reading and television.  The  
 girls' main pastimes were reading,    
 television, sewing, knitting and      
 keeping fit.  Some chose their        
 pastimes through necessity (Keeping   
 the garden tidy, growing food).       
 Others to save money (D.I.Y.,         
 gardening, knitting, sewing), others  
 to keep healthy and fit, but the main 
 reasons were relaxation and enjoyment.
       The Leisure Centre proved an    
 ideal venue for most of these         
 pastimes.                             </content>
