		<title>04HOUSES IN PRESTATYN</title>
		<content> In{Prestatyn}there is a variety of    
 houses.Many new estates have been     
 built in the 1980s.There are some     
 attractive old buildings around the{  
{High Street}area. The materials on the
 new houses are different from the old 
 in lots of ways.They use bricks for   
 the outside wall but for the inside of
 the houses they use big concrete      
 blocks which help to keep the house   
 insulated.Many of the new houses have 
 double glazing which has aluminium or 
 UPVC frames, again to keep the warmth 
 in.In the older houses the window     
 frames are made out of wood.The       
 tiles on the roofs of the old houses  
 are made out of slate but on the new  
 houses the tiles are made out of clay 
 or concrete. There are{council estates
 to the west of High St. but most      
 houses are privately owned. {
