		<title>19Landscape-Leeswood</title>
		<content> The landscape of this area is rolling 
 and hilly.                            
   The highest point is 850 feet, near 
 the top of Hope Mountain.The lowest   
 point 375 feet is the valley of Nant  
 Brook as it leaves the area.The       
 highest and lowest points are only a  
 mile apart as the crow flies.         
   The landscape is crossed by a number
 of small streams,the largest being the
 Terrig,Cegidog and the Nant Brook of  
 Leeswood,Coed Talon and Pontybodkin.  
   The villages are clustered around   
 the sites of now-disappeared          
 collieries.                           
  The villages have grown considerably 
 in recent times;many outsiders have   
 moved into the area because housing is
 relatively cheap.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
