 pence a time.Mr Smith used to be the

 charge 6 pence for men and 3 pence for
 little boys.Llansamlet has changed a  
 great deal.Everyone was like one big  
 family, the same attitudes, the same  
 way of life.But now, the younger      
 generation have stepped in and the    
 family has gone it's seperate ways.Mr 
 Smith is a community warden.He has to
