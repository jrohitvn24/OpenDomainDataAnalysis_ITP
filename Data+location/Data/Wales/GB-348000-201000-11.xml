		<title>11Whitelye Methodist Chapel</title>
		<content> Whitelye Methodist Chapel was built in
 l86O as a place of religion.  Local   
 labourers, who fealt they needed      
 somewhere to worship, paid for the    
 materials and helped to build it,     
 under the supervision of a qualified  
 builder. At the moment there is a     
 sunday school of l3.  The service     
 starts at ll o'clock with a hymn and a
 bible story, then a game and a quiz   
 based on the bible story.  The service
 ends at l2.l5pm.                      
 On Sunday evenings at 6.l5pm there is 
 a church service. First there is a    
 hymn, then the laypreacher says a     
 prayer followed by more hymns and a   
 sermon and finally the grace is sung. 
 Sadly these services are under threat 
 of closure because so few people are  
 going.
