		<title>12Loughor Castle.</title>
		<content> After the Norman Conqust in 1066,the  
 Normans built a series of castles in  
 Wales.These were to help them rule the
 people.Many of these were built on the
 site of an old Roman fort.One of these
 castles was at Loughor where the      
 Romans had built a large fort to guard
 the river crossing,and the ferry which
 gave access to the Gower from the     
 West.The Norman castle was built by   
 Henry Beaumont,First Earl of Warwick  
 in 1099.                              
    All that remains of the castle     
 today is the mound or rise in the     
 ground and what appears to be the     
 outside of a tower.A lot of work has  
 been carried out on the ruins of the  
 castle before it is cleared for a new 
 road to be built.Many things have been
 found such as coins,jugs,cups and     
 rings.These ancient finds help us to  
 understand Norman life in our area.   </content>
