		<title>20Nercwys and Eryrys - Survey</title>
		<content>  This block has been researchd by     
 members of Nercwys Women's Institute, 
 some members of which live within the 
 block. Some members involved have     
 lived in the area all their lives,    
 others are fairly recent newcomers.   
  Much help has been received from     
 others. Official records in Clwyd have
 given information, as have the owners 
 of the local quarry and tarmacadam    
 plant. Much information was gained    
 from the book 'Just One Parish' by    
 Mrs.Seed Knowles, which is about the  
 parish of Llanarmon, including Eryrys.
  Many local people made valuable      
 contributions, including the Welsh    
 language and translation.             
  The researchers were:- Miss          
 W.Griffiths, Mrs.A.Roberts, Mrs       
 C.Williams, Mrs.H.Bravey,             
 Mrs.M.Thomas, Miss H.Ingman,          
 Mrs.M.Buckland, Mrs.E.Murphy.         </content>
