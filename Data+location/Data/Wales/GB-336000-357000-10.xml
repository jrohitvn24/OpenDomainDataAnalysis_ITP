		<title>10Farming in Rossett</title>
		<content> A typical local farm is Rossett Hall  
 Farm which is on the Chester/Wrexham  
 road equidistant from both towns. The 
 farmer, K.G.Brereton, has lived there 
 for 15 years.                         
                                       
 It is a dairy farm with 70 acres of   
 land and a herd of 50 friesian cattle.
 The milk yield per cow per day is     
 between 3 and 6 gallons. The average  
 annual milk yield is 1000 gallons.    
                                       
 The land is mainly used for grazing   
 but the rest is used for growing      
 winter fodder including corn, silage  
 and hay.  The hay is stored in an open
 barn and the corn in a loft. Silage is
 stored in a new silage pit.           
                                       
 Recently a modern milking parlour and 
 a cubicle shed have been built.
