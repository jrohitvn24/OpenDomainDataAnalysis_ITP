		<content> Although John Christie was not a      
 farmer he embarked upon an ambitious  
 plan to develop the not vey promising 
 resources of the Great Forest and he  
 invested as greast deal of money in   
 the projects. These fall into three   
 categories: limestone quarrying and   
 coal mining in the Tawe valley(which  
 does not concern us here) and farming.
 He developed Cnewr as a sheep farm and
 evidently tried some early experiments
 in grazing Cheviot sheep on these     
 hills.  He also built the Brecon      
 Forest Tramroad intended to transport 
 lime and coal from the Tawe valley    
 to Sennybridge.However the expence of 
 this veture eventually bankrupted him.
 Ownership of the Crown Allotment there
 -fore passed to J.Claypon(1788?-1859),
 a Lincolnshire banker who was the prin
 -cipal creditor.It was he who complet-
 ed and ran the Tramroad.              </content>
