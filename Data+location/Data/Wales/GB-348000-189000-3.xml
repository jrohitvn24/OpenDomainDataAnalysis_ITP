		<title>03MATHERN VILLAGE SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>    There is a little village in the   
 corner of Gwent called Mathern.  There
 lies our school which has 78 pupils   
 aged four to eleven.   In 1724,(260   
 years ago) a man called Charles Pratt 
 left money in his will for a school to
 be built so that the "poore children  
 of Matherne" could be educated "for   
 ever".                                
    In school we have 3 computers, 2   
 televisions, a video recorder, record 
 player and telephone.                 
    The lessons we have include Maths, 
 English, Music, Physical Education,   
 Art, Environmental Study Projects,    
 Games and Swimming.                   
    We enjoy many activities like      
 school trips, sports day, swimming    
 galas, pantomimes, and special church 
 services at Harvest Time, Christmas   
 and at the end of the school year in  
 July.                                 </content>
