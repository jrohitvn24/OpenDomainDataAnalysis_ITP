 are public services, e.g.{North Wales 
{Hospital}and commercial premises in   
 the town centre.The{industrial estate 
 provides skilled and unskilled job    
 opportunities in a variety of light   
 industries.                           
   The unemployment trend is rising    
 although seasonal factors bring about 
 a fluctuation in statistics.          
   The unemployment rate is{13.4%}.Of  
 those unemployed{712}are men and{446  
 are women. Opportunities for          
 employment are not encouraging        
 especially with the general lack of   
 industrial growth nationwide and in   
 nearby industrial areas such as       
 Deeside,which once provided many{job  
{opportunities.}Many feel they are in a
 desperate situation and are having to 
 endure the many hardships that        
 unemployment brings.                  </content>
