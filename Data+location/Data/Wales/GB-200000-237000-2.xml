		<title>02A Visitor's View of Dinas</title>
		<content>  {During April 1985 two children from 
{New Zealand spent a short time at our 
{school.Here is what one of them       
{thought of our area. }                
                                       
 I think of Dinas as a well            
 cultivated,clean area.I think that it 
 has lovely farmland and meadows and   
 paddocks.I also think that the people 
 there are always cheery and           
 pleasant,polite people.               
   The school is a friendly place as   
 well.I also believe that it is good of
 them to learn to speak as much Welsh  
 as they can so that the language never
 dies out.                             
    Dinas is a very quiet and pretty   
 village and I like it a lot.
