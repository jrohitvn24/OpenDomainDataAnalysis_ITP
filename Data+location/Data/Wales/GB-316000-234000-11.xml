		<content> OLD  GWERNYFED COUNTRY MANOR WAS      
 BUILT TOWARDS THE END OF THE 16TH     
 CENTURY ON THE SITE OF AN OLDER       
 DWELLING. IN 1633 IT WAS MODERNISED   
 AND THE OWNERS EXTENDED THE ESTATE TO 
 NEARLY 4000 ACRES, A PLACE OF GREAT   
 LOCAL IMPORTANCE. IN 1780 A FIRE      
 GUTTED THE SOUTH WING AND THE WOOD    
 FAMILY WHO OWNED IT LEFT. UNTIL 1930  
 GWERNYFED WAS LEFT TO DETERIORATE AND 
 USED AS A FARMHOUSE. THE FAMILY AGAIN 
 INTERESTED THEMSELVES IN THE HOUSE AND
 USED IT AS A SUMMER HOUSE AFTER THEY  
 HAD EVACUATED THEMSELVES HERE DURING  
 THE WAR. IN 1964 THE BEETHAM FAMILY   
 MOVED IN AND STARTED THE RENOVATION.  
 IN 1970 THEY BEGAN TO TAKE IN 'BED &amp;  
 BREKFAST' CLIENTS. NOW IT HAS A       
 FLOURISHING RESIDENTIAL TRADE WHERE   
 PEOPLE CAM ENJOY A RESTFUL HOLIDAY IN 
 THE BEAUTY OF THE BLACK MOUNTAINS.
