		<content> A great cause of dissatiscation       
 amongst the residents is that the     
 nearest Doctors surgery is held in    
 Dyserth. The elderly people find it   
 difficult to attend,especially since  
 the near demise of the public         
 transport system.They are also unhappy
 about the lack of provision with the  
 village for the dispensing of         
 prescriptions.Many voiced their views 
 that they would like to see the       
 re_instatement of a regular surgery in
 the village.The O.A.P. bungalows are  
 supervised by a Warden who assists the
 residents with their health           
 promblems.The nearest Dentist or Natal
 Clinic is held at the Health Clinic in
 prestatyn.A Chiropodist makes regular 
 weekly visits to Dyserth.Emergency    
 cases,requiring hospital              
 attention,have to go to the hospital  
 at Bodelwyddan.                       </content>
