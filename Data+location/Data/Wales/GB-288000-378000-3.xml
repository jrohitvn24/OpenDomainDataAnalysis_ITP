		<title>03The old village,Llanddulas.</title>
		<content> It's hard to say how old the old      
 village is,for it started as only a   
 few farm houses.                      
         In the 5th century damage     
 occurred to the church,and papers were
 found proving that there was a        
 church.The first church was originally
 whitewashed but is now grey stone.Many
 of the houses in the old village were 
 knocked down 12 years ago by Price    
 Brothers to make  room for the new    
 estate.There is still much of the old 
 village left.It goes up Minffordd Rd. 
 and along Abergele Rd.You can tell the
 old houses from the new because the   
 old houses are grey stone like the    
 present day church.The stone is local 
 limestone from Llanddulas Quarry.     
 People call the old village Llan,     
 meaning Church,because most of the old
 village was clustered around the St.  
 Cynbryd's church.                     </content>
