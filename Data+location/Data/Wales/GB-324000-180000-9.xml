		<title>09   FARMING</title>
		<content> The area lies between the mountains   
 and the sea on the costal plain,      
 between Newport and Cardiff.The farms 
 are all over a hundred years old but  
 have been brought up to date with     
 electricity,gas,piped water,etc...They
 are all between 50 and 100 acres in   
 size.They all rear animals as the land
 is too salty to grow crops.The main   
 animals kept were goats,horses,pigs   
 and cows kept for meat and skins as   
 little milk is sold to the dairy.The  
 farms are family run and provide      
 little employment for local people.   
 They grow few crops for their own use.
        The sea washed turf is popular 
 for lawns and much is cut in the area.
