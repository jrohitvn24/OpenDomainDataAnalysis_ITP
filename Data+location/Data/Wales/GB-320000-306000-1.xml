 about 7,000 people situated on the    
 River Severn near the English border  
 about 18 miles south west of          
 Shrewsbury.The old border between the 
 two countries,Offa's Dyke, runs about 
 1\ miles to the east of the town.     
 The town is in the middle of a farming
 community and is an important         
 agricultural and market centre.  The  
 town's Welsh name is{"Y Trallwng"}    
 which means a marshy place but in     
 spite of its name it has few Welsh    
 speaking inhabitants.  The town became
 known as Welshpool in the 19th Century
 to distinguish it from Poole in       
 Dorset.  The{livestock market}is one  
 of the largest in Europe.  Other      
 attractions include{Powys Castle,}one 
 of the two remaining{cockpits}in
