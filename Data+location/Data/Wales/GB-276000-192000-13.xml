		<title>13Fathers' Occupations.</title>
		<content> We compared the school records of     
 fathers' occupations now with those of
{50}years ago. We ignored the fact that
 families have grown smaller in recent 
 years and that many fathers were      
 obviously counted more than once.     
   Our results of {50}years ago gave us
 a total of {172}coal miners.At present
 there is only {1}father who works down
 a mine , an indication of the large   
 scale closure of pits that has taken  
 place over the years. The other main  
 jobs of {50}years ago were            
 steelworkers, railwaymen and          
 labourers.                            
   Today, the occupations of fathers   
 are very varied, with no predominance 
 of any specific job, apart from       
 possibly working in the Port Talbot   
 Steel Works.
