		<title>02DIET IN CARMARTHEN</title>
		<content> We visited the Tesco Supermarket in   
 Carmarthen and interviewed the Manager
 of the store.The questions asked were 
 about the eating habits of the        
 Carmarthen people.                    
  The most popular breakfast cereal    
 was found to be Kelloggs Cornflakes,  
 followed by Wheatabix and Sugar Puffs 
 came third.                           
  Of the meats eaten it was found that 
 beef was the favourite followed by    
 poultry,followed by Pork, and then    
 lamb.Out of the fruits the most       
 popular were apples followed by       
 oranges and bananas. The most popular 
 beverage is tea, but the gap between  
 coffee and tea is getting less.Of the 
 vegetables the most popular are peas  
 then carrots followed by sweetcorn.
