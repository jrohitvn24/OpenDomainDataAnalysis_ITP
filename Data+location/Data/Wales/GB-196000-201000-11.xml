		<title>11COSHESTON - OLD INDUSTRIES</title>
		<content>                                       
    Nowadays most people who live in   
 Cosheston work at the oil refineries  
 or power station. Most of them are    
 quite well off. 80 years ago it was   
 very different. Most of the villagers 
 worked on the land and many of them   
 were poor.                            
    Most people worked on farms. A lot 
 of horse training went on in the area 
 and some men worked at felling trees. 
 Others worked at rope making and stone
 quarrying at Cosheston Reaches.       
 A lot of lime burning went on and     
 there are old lime kilns still to be  
 seen today. There were lime kilns and 
 quarries at Lower Nash, too.          
    There was a small boatbuilding yard
 at Carton's Shipyard at The Bank,     
 Cosheston, and some men from the      
 village travelled to work at the big  
 Royal Dockyard at Pembroke Dock.      </content>
