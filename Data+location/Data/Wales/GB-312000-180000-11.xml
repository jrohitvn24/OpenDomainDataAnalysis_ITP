		<content> Our area has a variety of Sports      
 facilities.Caedelyn Fields and the    
 grounds of Whitchurch Hospital provide
 residents with football,rugby,cricket,
 bowls and tennis facilities.The       
 competitive spirit is fostered through
 competitions between local teams in   
 most sports.A golf course occupies a  
 large part of the area.It is one of   
 the few in the area and so people     
 journey quite a distance to play      
 there.There is not a single leisure   
 centre in our area.People living in   
 the area have to travel considerable  
 distances to swim.The pool at Radyr   
 Comprehensive is open both at weekends
 and evenings for local use.Local      
 schools compete at football,mini-rugby
 cricket and baseball.Whitchurch High  
 School is the base for a local junior 
 running club.
