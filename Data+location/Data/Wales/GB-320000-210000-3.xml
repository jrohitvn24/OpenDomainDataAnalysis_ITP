		<content> about a week.                         
  We have play for 20 minutes and      
 sometimes we can go down the bottom   
 yard.                                 
  The games I like to play are rugby,  
 football and tennis,I like playing    
 these games very much.                
  I like doing P.E.because it is fun,  
 sometimes you can do handstands and   
 lots of things like that.We sometimes 
 do piggy-back races but I hardly ever 
 win them.                             
  We go to Nant-y-Glo swimming baths   
 with the school for swimming lessons.I
 am in the deep-end.We sometimes do    
 swimming galas.                       
  We are going to collect some         
 caterpillars and keep them until they 
 are butterflies and we will let them  
 go.                                   
  That is what our school is like and  
 does.                                 </content>
