		<title>02Farming in  Uzmaston area.</title>
		<content> This area is mainly rural with 16     
 farms varying in size from 20 - 140   
 hectares. Twelve of these are now     
 owner-occupied whereas 30 years ago   
 they were all on estates. Those still 
 rented are {Millin, Cotts Park, Little
{Clarboro }and {Deep Lake.}Previously  
 all these would have been dairy farms 
 but now 50% are {livestock and arable}
 and all employ very little labour.    
 Winter and spring {barley}are grown   
 and {Cedar House}has about 10 hectares
 of {potatoes.}Grassland provides      
 grazing in summer and pit and big bale
 silage for winter use. {'Tack sheep'} 
 are brought from areas with a more    
 severe climate (e.g.Builth Wells) to  
 winter at {Hanton Farm,}a fixed sum is
 paid per sheep for shepherding and the
 sheep improve the pastures. {Mains    
{Water}supplies all farms and fields.
