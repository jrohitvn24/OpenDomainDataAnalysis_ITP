		<content>  Bryn Dafydd Fawr Farm is a tenanted  
 farm.It is owned by the family of Sir 
 John Llewellyn,the largest land owner 
 in our area.He once owned the         
 Blaen-y-maes area,until the council   
 bought the land off him to build a    
 housing estate.                       
  The farm is now run by Mr.D.M.Thomas 
 and his two brothers.They were brought
 up on the farm.His family has run it  
 since the middle of the last century. 
    The farm covers 300 acres of land. 
 It is a mixed dairy and a beef farm   
 with its main crop being grass which  
 is stored as silage.It also produces  
 a small crop of potatoes.The farm has 
 a herd of a 150 Freisian cows.The     
 E.E.C.milk quota will only allow the  
 owner to produce 400 gallons per day  
 and he is not allowed to keep any for 
 himself.
