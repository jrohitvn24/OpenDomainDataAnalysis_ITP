		<title>16DISASTER TWO AT CRICKHOWELL</title>
		<content> While the heating was being renewed { 
{ASBESTOS }was discovered in the       
 school. Asbestos is considered to be  
 highly dangerous and people can       
 develop cancer in later years.        
 After much discussion it was decided  
 that the school would have to be      
 closed while the asbestos was removed.
                                       
 The school was closed for two weeks at
 half term instead of the normal one   
 week.
