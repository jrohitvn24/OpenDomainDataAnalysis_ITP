		<content> The small graveyard surrounding the   
 church contains the graves of the     
 Jenner family who once held Wenvoe    
 Castle and owned Barry Docks.   The   
 graves are attended daily by a local  
 character, called Trevor, who is 74   
 years old.   He has been doing this   
 for the past six years.   He is also a
 master of topiary and has shaped a    
 teapot, cup and saucer from the hedge 
 in his own garden, opposite the       
 churchyard.   Situated near the church
 is a war memorial commemmorating the  
 heroism of soldiers from the village  
 who gave their lives in the Great War 
 of 1914-1919, including some members  
 of the Jenner family.   The names have
 been inscribed on a piece of rough    
 local stone.
