     Our rectangle is fairly near to   
 the coast.It has a recently built main
 road running through the middle.      
           Towards the  west of the    
 rectangle there is a small village    
 called Tal-y-Bont with a railway line 
 next to it.Penrhyn  Castle is an      
 historic building owned by the        
 National Trust. It is situated in the 
 North West of the rectangle.          
       There are a few farms and all of
 them are rented out by the Penrhyn    
 Estate.The Penrhyn slate railway      
 (which closed down a few years back)  
 used to run through the South West of 
 our rectangle.It took slate from      
 Penrhyn Quarry to Port Penrhyn docks  
 to be shipped to America.
