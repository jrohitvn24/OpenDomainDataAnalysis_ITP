 The annual cost of running the zoo is 
 a quarter of a million pounds.The cost
 of a single elephant's keep is around 
 Â£3,000 a year.In 1983 to help meet    
 these costs and to keep the zoo viable
 the zoo was taken over by,and became  
 the base of the{Zoological society of 
{Wales}.The Society is dedicated to    
 work in the fields of education and   
 conservation.                         
{Future plans}for the zoo include a new
 chimpanzee exhibit called {Chimpanzee 
{World.}Fund raising events for this   
 project were launched in July 1985    
 with the hope that the work could     
 begin in 1986.Other plans include an  
 otter complex and an adventure        
 playground.
