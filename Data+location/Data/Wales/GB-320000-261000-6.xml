 APPEAR TO BE ISOLATED BUT THEY ENJOY  
 MODERN AMENITIES PRINCIPALLY FROM NEW 
 RADNOR VILLAGE.  MOST HOUSES HAVE A   
 TELEPHONE AND THERE IS A DAILY        
 DELIVERY OF MAIL. CONSUMER GOODS MAY  
 BE BOUGHT IN KINGTON SIX MILES AWAY   
 BUT EVERYDAY SHOPPING IS DONE IN THE  
 VILLAGE WHERE A SMALL FAMILY BAKERY   
 BAKES BREAD AND CAKES AND SELLS       
 GROCERIES. ANOTHER SHOP HAS A WIDER   
 VARIETY OF GROCERIES AND ALSO SELLS   
 FRESH WELSH LAMB, HOME-MADE SAUSAGES  
 AND BEEFBURGERS. ROADS ARE WELL       
 MAINTAINED BY THE COUNTY COUNCIL      
 INCLUDING SNOW CLEARANCE. RUBBISH IS  
 COLLECTED FREQUENTLY. A MOBILE LIBRARY
 SERVES THE AREA.  THE SERVICES ARE    
 ALSO AVAILABLE OF A WATCH REPAIRER,
