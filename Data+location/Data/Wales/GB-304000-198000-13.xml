		<content> There are many coal tips overlooking  
 towns and villages in our area. Where 
 they look like becoming a danger or   
 are a real eyesore, the{Welsh         
{Development Agency and the National   
{Coal Board}have landscaped some of the
 tips with big machines.They have been 
 lowered and spread evenly over the    
 hillside and drainage channels put in.
 Grass and trees have then been planted
 to make them look attractive.         
 People in our area are very much      
 concerned about tips overlooking their
 towns.In{Aberfan in October 1966}a    
 coal tip did in fact slide down the   
 side of a mountain straight into a    
 school.{150 people were killed most of
{them children.}Since that time people 
 are more aware of the dangers and are 
 not prepared to put up with this      
 threat.
