		<content> People in Welshpool shop at the       
 village stores.  Sometimes they go to 
 Welshpool to the Kwiksave, or to      
 Tuffins at Churchstoke to buy all     
 their groceries.  Tuffins is open     
 on Sundays, which is very useful.     
 Bread is delivered by the baker two or
 three times a week, or we have to go  
 to Welshpool or Montgomery to buy it. 
 Most other things we can buy in       
 Montgomery or Welshpool.              
                                       
 We have to go to Shrewsbury or        
 Cardiff, sometimes as far as Chester, 
 to buy clothes and other big things.
