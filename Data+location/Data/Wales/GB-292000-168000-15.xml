		<title>15A Day at St.Donats</title>
		<content>  On a sunny Tuesday in late June      
 Classes 1 &amp; 2 from St Illtyds Junior  
 School were to spend a day at St      
 Donats Castle.We were greeted by a    
 student from the Falkland Islands who 
 was to be our guide.We were first     
 shown the farmland beloning to the    
 castle and then we walked past the    
 students quarters on our way to the   
 swimming pool.There  the students were
 doing a course on canoeing.Opposite   
 the pool was a lifeboat owned and     
 designed by the students named the    
 AMERICAN AMBASSADOR.We were then shown
 the launching pad of the boat.Next we 
 saw the students abseiling down the   
 cliff face.Every student has to go    
 through this training.After this we   
 wandered through the beautiful rose   
 gardens and saw also the places of    
 historical interest at the castle.We  
 had a very enjoyable day.             </content>
