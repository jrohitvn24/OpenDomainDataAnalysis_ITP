		<title>03THE RIVER WYE</title>
		<content>  The River Wye is well known for its  
 beauty and has been a source of       
 inspiration to poets through the      
 ages.This stretch of the river forms  
 part of the Lower Wye Valley which has
 been designated an Area of Outstanding
 Natural Beauty.                       
  It has its source in the Cambrian    
 Mountains,close to the source of the  
 River Severn,and after many miles of  
 meandering through beautiful          
 countryside flows into the Severn     
 Estuary at Chepstow,approximately four
 miles south of Tintern.               
  The Wye is tidal from the Severn,    
 through this area,to Brockweir Bridge 
 just to the north.It was once         
 navigable to trading ships,when the   
 area was industrial,but is now used   
 only by pleasure craft and for        
 fishing,particularly salmon and elver.
