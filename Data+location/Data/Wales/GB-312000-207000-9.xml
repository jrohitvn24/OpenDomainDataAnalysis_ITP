		<content> The roads in Tredegar need repairing  
because they are full of pot holes.    
people have had accidents because the  
roads are dangerous.  The worst roads  
are the main roads leading into and    
out of Tredegar.  Some of the side     
roads need attention as well.  We have 
two main bus services in Tredegar, one 
is the pubic service known as the "Red 
and White" and the other is the private
service "Hills".  It is a service that 
is well-known.  It is the bus service  
we use to go swimming and to go on     
trips.  There are two major car garages
in Tredegar, Ford and Vauxhall.  The   
most popular cars in Tredegar are Ford 
and Vauxhall.  The most popular car    
colours are blue and red.
