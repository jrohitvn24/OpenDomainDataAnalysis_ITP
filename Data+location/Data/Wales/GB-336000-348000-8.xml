		<content>    The Royal Ornance Factory had      
 formerly employed over 10,000 people  
 when in 1947 it was taken over by     
 Wales and Monmouthshire Estates Ltd.  
 Of the 2,400 acres of land 1,700 was  
 transferred to the Ministry of        
 Agriculture and went back to its      
 former use. Under the aegis of the    
 Welsh Industrial Estates Corporation  
 attempts were made to move away from  
 the previously predominant coal and   
 steel industries of the Wrexham area. 
 The first factory to arrive was       
 Johnson and Johnson, making surgical  
 tissues. Others were British Celanese,
 Hunt's Capacitors and Consolidated    
 Chemicals. Government aid brought the 
 Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. in 1967 
 as well as British Insulated Callender
 Cables, Fibreglass in 1970 and Kellogs
 in 1974. 6,000 people then worked on  
 the estate, which has expanded since. </content>
