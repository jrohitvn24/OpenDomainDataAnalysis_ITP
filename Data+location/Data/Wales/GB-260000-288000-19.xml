		<title>19TOURISM _ BORTH</title>
		<content>    Since Thomas Savin brought the     
 railway and the first tourists to     
 Borth in 1863, tourism has prospered  
 and the locals learned to cater for   
 them. The first hotel built by Savin  
 was soon followed by others, and there
 are now The Cliff, The Golf, The Grand
 and The Railway Hotels in Borth. Many 
 people also provide bed and breakfast 
 accomodation, there is a Youth Hostel,
 and there are various static and      
 touring caravan and camping sites _   
 Brynowen, Brynrodyn, Glanlery, Golden 
 Sands and Ysfron. Numerous houses,    
 cottages and flats are let for        
 holidays during the summer months.    
    Local walks, craft shops, clubs and
 activities at the caravan sites and in
 the community, swimming pools,        
 amusement arcades and donkey rides    
 help to cater for the entertainment of
 the visitors.                         </content>
