		<title>13FARMING IN WISTON-BY CLASS 4</title>
		<content> We surveyed several farms in the      
 Wiston area.The overall sizes of the  
 farms in our area varied from 95 acres
 to 400 acres.The average size of a    
 farm was 198 acres.We wanted to find  
 out how much labour was used in farms 
 in 1985 and this turned out to be on  
 average one man per 95 acres.All the  
 farmers told us that this depended on 
 whether the farm was beef or dairy and
 how much work was done by contractors 
 to make silage. All the farms we      
 surveyedkept cows as the main farm    
 income.Three were dairy,two were mixed
 dairy and beef and two were beef.The  
 dairy and mixed farms kept Fresian    
 cows while the beef farms kept        
 Hereford with some Holstein cross.Five
 of the seven farms were self          
 sufficient in feed stuff.             
  The major land cover on all the farms
 are cultivated grass.                 </content>
