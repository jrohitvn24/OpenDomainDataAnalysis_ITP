		<content> Much interest is shown in fashion and 
 beauty, pop music and many people     
 imitate the clothing, hairstyles etc. 
 of television and film personalities. 
 There is also a growing number of     
 people who regularly eat out. In      
 nearly every community there are      
 Indian and Chinese food take-aways in 
 many cases replacing the traditional  
 cafe-cum-chip shop. Many public houses
 are adding on dining rooms with an    
 ever increasing range of menu and     
 restaurants are frequently being      
 opened. In many areas more            
 sophisticated private clubs which     
 cater for gambling as well as drinking
 and eating at a more basic level the  
 betting shops cater for gambling on   
 horses, dog racing and major sporting 
 events.
