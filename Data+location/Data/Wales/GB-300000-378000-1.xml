		<title>01Rhyl: town and countryside</title>
		<content> Rhyl town is probably best known as a 
 seaside resort,lying on the North     
 Wales coast.The town has a{population}
 of around 20,000 and at the height of 
 the summer season it may triple in    
 size. The town lies on what was a     
 small hill about one mile from the    
 shore.The towns origional name        
 was'yrhyl' meaning a hill.Beyond Rhyl 
 is a chain of small towns leading     
 further inland to the{Clwydian}range  
 of mountains.The upland{farms}rely    
 upon{government}grants to support     
 livestock production.The Clwyd valley 
 farms are generally dairy farms.      
  Moving eastwards from Rhyl along the 
 coast the towns are more              
 industrialised.The highly polluted    
 River Dee flows into the sea along    
 this stretch of coast.Along its shores
 is the Point of Ayr Colliery, where   
 coal is mined from beneath the sea bed</content>
