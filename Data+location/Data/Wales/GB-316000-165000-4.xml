		<content>{Avalon}is a completely new concept in 
 leisure, health and beauty. It lies in
 its own valley in peaceful            
 surroundings, looking over the Bristol
 Channel.                              
   You can swim in or relax beside the 
 heated indoor swimming pool, and on   
 sunny days enjoy the natural sun,     
 lounging on the poolside patio.       
   Avalon has a spa pool and a natural 
 wood sauna cabin. There is also a     
 steam room, special exercise equipment
 and sun beds. It also has its own     
 resident beautician.                  
   You can enjoy eating and drinking at
 the snack bar which is open from 10am 
 until 10pm every day except Monday.   
   A three hour session costs Â£5 or you
 can spend the day at Avalon for Â£15.  
   Avalon is open to anyone over the   
 age of 18.
