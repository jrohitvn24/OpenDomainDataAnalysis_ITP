		<title>02COOK'S BRIDGE FARM (CONT.)</title>
		<content> Then we went to see a bull;he was     
 massive! He was nearly 2m.tall,       
 weighed nearly a tonne and had a ring 
 through his nose.                     
 Then we went to the milking parlour.We
 saw the electric milking machine and  
 the farmer told us to put our thumbs  
 in a black rubber thing which went on 
 the cows udders_ it felt like someone 
 was sucking our thumb.                
 14 cows could be milked at one time   
 using this machine.The milk travelled 
 along some pipes and was collected in 
 a large stainless steel container.    
 Every day the cows produced between   
 1700 and 1800 litres of milk.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
