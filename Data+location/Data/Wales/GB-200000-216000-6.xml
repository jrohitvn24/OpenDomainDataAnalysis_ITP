		<content> Clarbeston Road.                      
  An old water pump stood on the       
 'island'in the road just East of the  
 present school,at the head of the road
 leading to Conkland Hill.             
  Up until about 20 years ago,the      
 village blacksmith's shop was at Long 
 Garden now a private house in the     
 village.                              
  It was about this time too,that the  
 regular bus service to Haverfordwest  
 ceased to operate.                    
  Several farms in the area have       
 amalgamated since the last war,with   
 their farm houses converted to private
 houses.The numbers of people employed 
 at the farms has dropped dramatically 
 and now no-one living in the village  
 itself works on a farm. Everyone      
 leaves the village to go to their     
 place of work or are retired.         
                             THE END.  </content>
