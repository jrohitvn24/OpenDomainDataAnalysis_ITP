		<content> Most homes are owner occupied, several
 are used as second homes or holiday   
 cottages. Proportion of elderly people
 has increased significantly in recent 
 years with younger family members     
 seeking employment elsewhere.         
 Traditional open fireplaces have been 
 sealed for installation of Rayburns   
 and wood burning stoves. Several      
 newcomers have restored original      
 character of homes. People who have   
 always lived in area still have 4     
 meals a day and traditional sunday    
 lunch . Cawl has retaind its          
 popularity. Local speciality is Gwledd
 Y Cybydd (Misers Feats) sliced        
 potatoes, onions and bacon, cooked in 
 an open fire. Bara Planc (unleavened  
 bread baked on bakestone) Pice ar y   
 maen (Welsh cakes) and Tarten ar y    
 Maen (griddle tart) also very popular.
