		<title>10MYNYDDBACH CHOIR, SWANSEA</title>
		<content> The choir includes 60 girls (11 to 18)
 who rehearse at lunchtime every day.  
 It changes each year because of the   
 new entrants to the school and the    
 school leavers. The choir has given   
 many charity concerts and has competed
 in the Urdd, Llangollen and National  
 Eisteddfodau. In 1982 the choir gained
 first prize in both school choir      
 competitions at the Swansea National  
 Eisteddfod and in 1985 first prize at 
 the Pontrhyfendigaid Eisteddfod's     
 school competition. The choir have    
 performed a televised workshop of     
 Holst's "Planets". In 1981 they       
 appeared with the Welsh Symphony      
 Orchestra. In 1984 they took part in a
 BBC Wales broadcast. In 1977 and 1981 
 they went to Mannheim (Swansea's twin 
 town). The musical director since 1974
 has been Eric Jones, the school's Head
 of Music.                             </content>
