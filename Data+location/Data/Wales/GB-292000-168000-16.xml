		<content>  All students have to learn one       
 foreign language.Many students        
 continue learning one which they have 
 already started in another school.It  
 is possible to start a new language   
 (Spanish,Russian,Chinese and sometimes
 Italian).This year 1984-1985 some     
 students are studying Japanese and    
 Dutch,but not as beginners.If the     
 students work well they will have     
 achieved a sound knowledge of it by   
 the end of a two year course and will 
 pass the INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE  
 with a good grade at higher or        
 subsidiary knowledge.                 
  It is not easy to learn a new        
 language once a pupil has left        
 school.Usually lessons are expensive  
 and difficult to find the time.There  
 are many pieces of equipment to help  
 the students:a language lab.,short    
 wave radio and a computer.            </content>
