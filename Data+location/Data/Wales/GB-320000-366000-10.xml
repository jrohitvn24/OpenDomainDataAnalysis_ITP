		<content> Lots of the buildings in this area are
 old.  They are detached houses,       
 cottages and farms.  They are built of
 stone with slate roofs.  Many of them 
 have been renovated.  They have been  
 made longer and some have had         
 extensions built on to them.  There   
 are two housing estates and the houses
 in them are terraced.  The majority of
 the old houses face South and East.   
 This is because they have been built  
 with their backs to the West from     
 where most of our bad weather comes.  
 There are modern built houses made of 
 bricks with a tile roof.  There are   
 detached buildings but some in        
 Rhydymwyn form a small housing estate.
