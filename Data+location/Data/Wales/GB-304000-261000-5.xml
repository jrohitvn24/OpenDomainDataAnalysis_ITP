		<title>05THE OLD CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The Old Church was founded around   
 the 12th century. Llandrindod-the     
 Church of Trinity was before 1400     
 called Llandduw-the church of         
 God.Until the 18th century much of the
 history was a mystery . By 1830       
 the towns fortunes were already       
 recovering and the first Pump House   
 was built.Doubt remains whether the   
 little church shared in the prosperity
 which the rich visitors brought to the
 town for the condition of the church  
 was generally poor and uncared for.   
   The Old  Church and Cefnllys Church 
 were no longer adequate in size and   
 and location,to meet the demands of a 
 growing population and increasing     
 numbers of visitors.This is why a new 
 church was built,being called Holy    
 Trinity.Today services are still held 
 at the Old Church once a month.
