		<title>13Catbrook Football Club</title>
		<content> Football is an important recreation in
 the area.  Catbrook Football Club was 
 formed in l9l3, and is one of the     
 oldest clubs in the East Gwent League.
 At the moment it plays on the Catbrook
 Playing Field and has done so for the 
 last l2 years.  Previously they played
 on seven different grounds with local 
 farmers' consent. The Catbrook        
 Football team has throughout the years
 achieved many honours, winning the    
 league lO times, the Watkins Shield ll
 times and the Harry Gill Cup nine     
 times. They have won the Second       
 Division once and the Argus Shield    
 twice.  Catbrook Football teams have  
 had a very good past and they will    
 hopefully have a good future.
