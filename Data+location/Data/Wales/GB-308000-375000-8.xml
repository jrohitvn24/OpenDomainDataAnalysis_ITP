		<content>  Shopping proves to be an awkward     
 necessity in the area surveyed, with  
 all the inhabitants having to travel  
 between 3 and 5 miles outside the     
 block for their basic needs, e.g.     
 bread, butter and tea etc.. The survey
 showed  that with the complete lack of
 transport people tried to keep their  
 shopping trips to a minimum, with car 
 owners collecting shopping for        
 neighbours particularly the old or    
 infirm. Once or twice a week is the   
 average with items other than basics  
 requiring 5 extra miles of travel.    
 Larger items such as furniture,       
 carpets etc. are obtained at Chester  
 30 miles East of the block. In the    
 Winter during periods of snow and ice,
 shopping can become a difficulty with 
 many minor roads and lanes being      
 totally blocked.
