		<content> This parish has been essentially      
 Welsh-speaking since originally       
 settled.Towns in the Vale of Clwyd    
 have been Anglicised since they grew  
 up around the castles of the Norman   
 Conquest,but this influence has been  
 negligible in rural areas,especially  
 hilly,where the Feudal System was     
 difficult to apply.                   
 Welsh has therefore survived by being 
 closely allied to the hill-farm and   
 owes little to the larger estates nor 
 nearby towns.                         
 It may be true to say that the future 
 of the language lies today in the     
 hands of the schools rather than      
 the traditional areas of home and     
 chapel.Clwyd  Education Authority     
 operates a Bilingual language policy.
