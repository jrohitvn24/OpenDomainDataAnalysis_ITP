		<title>09THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was closed and re-opened   
 several times owing to lack of        
 support.Children in those days were   
 not compelled to attend school.In one 
 of the log books there is a gap of 18 
 months.From March 1873 until June     
 1874.It was opened again in 1874 and  
 20 pupils left a nearby school and    
 came to Garth School.The school wasn't
 the same as it is today.There used to 
 be 1 school room to begin with and the
 master was complaining about the      
 crammed state of the class room.The   
 children used to write on slates with 
 special pens.It wasn't  until 1889    
 that standard 2 started to write on   
 paper,and that was sixteen years after
 the school had opened.120 pupils were 
 packed into the main room wich was    
 only fixed for seating for 54         
 children.The school was enlarged in   
 1894,and then our class was added on. </content>
