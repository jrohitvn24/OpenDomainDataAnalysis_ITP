 Some of the woodland in this area is  
 over{100yrs. old},with a good mixture 
 of evergreens, including pine &amp; holly,
 &amp; deciduous trees including willow,   
 chestnuts, sycamore, beech birch &amp;    
 oak. Many new trees have also been    
 planted, 1 estate has planted over    
{1,000 trees}.Here woods are maintained
 for pheasant.In addition, about 30yrs.
 ago a firm which produces matches     
 planted{8,000 poplars}with a view to  
 using them for manufacture.However    
 since the demand for matches has      
 declined,they are no longer needed.One
 batch was felled this year.Only one   
 significant area of woodland has      
 disappeared from 100yrs. ago and new  
 planting has more than replaced it.   
 Large old properties are usually set  
 in mature trees.One house has a fine  
 specimen of a fern beech.             </content>
