 This is a report from the local paper 
 the Abergele Visitor the week after   
 the first concert was given at the    
 Hall. "The first concert in the new   
 look hallwas on Satruday, 7th Sept.   
 1985 when the Rhyl Music Club launched
 a gala inaugural performance with     
 American singers, Jo Ann Pickens and  
 Donnie Ray Albert, accompanied by     
 Antony Saunders."  "This was voted a  
 great success," Mr. J. Parr, Castle   
 Administrator said, "organisers were  
 delighted with the first concert and  
 the support given by local people.  We
 had a full Hall apart from 20 seats,  
 and the only comments I had all       
 evening were congratulatory. The      
 artists received a standing ovation   
 with their rendition of songs from    
 Porgy and Bess proving to be the      
 highlights of the evening."           </content>
