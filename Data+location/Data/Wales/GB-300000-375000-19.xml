		<content> The eastern part of the survey area is
 predominantly farmland adjoining the  
 Rivers Clwyd and Elwy.The land is     
 apparently fertile and is given over  
 to mixed farming.This part of the area
 would appear to be farmed by approx-  
 imately six major farmers.In one case,
{Bryn Gwyn Farm}a flourishing dairy    
 would appear to have been established,
 supplying many local households.In    
 addition to grass, cereal and root    
 crops,shhep and dairy farming would   
 appear to predominate.During the      
 1960's, farmers frequently suffered   
 heavy losses as a result of the       
 flooding of the Rivers Clwyd and Elwy 
 but embankments have been established 
 in order to control this problem.     
 In addition to the mixed farming      
 outlined above, market gardening would
 appear to be a 'growing' industry in  
 the immediate neighbourhood.          </content>
