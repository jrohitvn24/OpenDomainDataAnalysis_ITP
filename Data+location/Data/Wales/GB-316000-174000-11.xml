 The Empire Pool (178/759) was built in
 1958 when Cardiff staged the          
 Commonwealth Games. 80% of the people 
 said they had been there and one in   
 three said they attended regularly.   
                                       
 Three in every four people said they  
 watched sport on television, a half   
 watch it often. Most people enjoyed a 
 wide range of sports but the most     
 popular were Rugby and Football,      
 followed closely by Tennis and        
 Athletics.                            
 Hobbies varied with age from sewing,  
 knitting and reading to jogging and   
 dancing.                              
 When asked which building their area  
 required most, the young people said a
 Disco or an Ice Rink; while most of   
 the adults said a Theatre or a Cinema.</content>
