		<title>14BROCKWEIR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Brockweir Primary School was opened 
 in 1896 and is funded today by Glouce-
 stershire Education Authority.Its pre-
 sent Headmistress is Mrs.Hopwood who  
 is working on the Domesday Project    
 with her pupils,on the area south of  
 the school.                           
   There are forty-five children in the
 school:-twenty infants and twenty-five
 juniors.All but two of the children   
 live in Brockweir or Hewelsfield. The 
 number of children attending the      
 school has remained fairly steady.    
    There are two classes of mixed ages
 and abilities.The children go on to   
 Wyedean Comprehensive in Sedbury when 
 they are eleven.The school has a happy
 family atmosphere with 75% of the     
 pupils staying for school lunch (unus-
 ual in this age of packed lunches).A  
 new Airline Canteen Service has proved
 very popular with the children.       </content>
