		<title>18CHANGES IN CARMARTHEN</title>
		<content>    I asked my gran some questions     
 about Carmarthen to see how it has    
 changed in the past 50 years.She said 
 that Carmarthen has changed in a      
 number of ways.For example,there are  
 many more shops than there used to be.
 There used to be more public houses 50
 years ago but she thinks there are    
 more ruffians about now.              
    She said that the town centre has  
 changed because a lot of buildings    
 have been knocked down.               
    She thought that it was a busier   
 town 50 years ago because more farmers
 came in and more people seemed to come
 to things like the Horse Fair in      
 Lammas Street.                        
      When I asked her if Carmarthen   
 had a mayor 50 years ago she said it  
 did.I think that my gran believes that
 Carmarthen is a better place to live  
 in now.        By Sarah Powell.       </content>
