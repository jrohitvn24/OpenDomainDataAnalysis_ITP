		<title>04WESTFIELD MARINA(2), NEYLAND</title>
		<content>   The Marina is surrounded by the     
 natural beauty of the{National Park,  
 and on one side there is more than    
 twenty miles of sheltered river.      
   They mean to make the adjoining area
{a sanctuary for wildlife;}and slowly  
 it is beginning to look a lot less    
 like mud and a little more like a     
 natural nature reserve. They hope to  
 increase trade by building a cafe on  
 the quayside as people may come there 
 for a snack or lunch. The Marina has  
 lately had a visitor: A Chinese Junk. 
 This boat glided magnificently into   
 the Haven and was watched by amazed   
 onlookers. It was on a return journey 
 after docking at Manchester and       
 Liverpool. At present the Marina      
 is well established and boats are soon
 filling it up.
