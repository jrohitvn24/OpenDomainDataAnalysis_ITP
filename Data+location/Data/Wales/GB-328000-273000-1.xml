		<content> Stowe village is in that part of      
 Shropshire designated an area of      
 outstanding natural beauty. It is in a
 landscape of steeply wooded hills,    
 narrow valleys with streams,          
 interspersed with small fields of     
 arable and pasture for sheep and      
 cattle. The village contains a church,
 farm and a handful of houses. The rest
 of the area consists of isolated hill 
 farms. Forestry and farming provide   
 employment for a few, the remainder   
 having to find work outside the area. 
 There is no public transport, though  
 the Heart of Wales railway passes     
 through the Teme valley in the south, 
 with the nearest  station at Knighton 
 3 Km away. The summit of Stowe Hill is
 marked by a survey point 427m, and 1Km
 to the north stands the ancient       
 British hill fort of Caer Caradoc.
