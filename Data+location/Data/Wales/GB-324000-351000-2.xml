		<title>02HISTORY OF MINERA</title>
		<content> The name Minera means ore in medieval 
 Latin and lead has been mined in the  
 area since the Roman times,when there 
  were strong links with the garrison  
 at Deva(Chester).Lead mining continued
 until immediately prior to World War  
 One.The mines are now derelict.       
 The township of Minera has only been  
 in existence since the mid-14th       
 century and until circa 1860 the area 
 was primarily a farming community.
