		<title>06"The Haywain" Public House</title>
		<content> My family live in a comfortable flat  
 in a public house. My father is the   
 publican of "The Haywain". The pub is 
 about twenty three years old and was  
 built on the site of an old farmhouse.
 It was named after a famous painting. 
 We have renovated an old Gloucester   
 Gambol and placed it in the front car 
 park.                                 
    About two hundred people visit     
 each evening  and sometimes my mum has
 to help. The most popular drinks are  
 beer (70 p a pint) and wine (60 p a   
 glass). People are also able to buy   
 snacks and, if they wish, play darts, 
 pool or cards. our special Sunday     
 lunches are very popular.
