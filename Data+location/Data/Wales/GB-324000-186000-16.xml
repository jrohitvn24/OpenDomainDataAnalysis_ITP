		<title>16HOUSES IN ROGERSTONE-1</title>
		<content>Most houses built before 1900 are to be
found in the rural area.They are mainly
farmhouses and small cottages built by 
Lord Tredegar for estate workers.There 
are,however,still some late 19th       
century terraced houses at Rogerstone  
built for industrial workers.          
    The early 20th century houses are  
brick villas,council houses and semi-  
detached and detached houses lining the
main roads.                            
    The most recent developments have  
been estates at Rogerstone,Bassaleg    
and Rhiwderin.Estate agents told us    
that most of the houses for sale in our
block were on estates.                 
    Prices varied from 15,000 for a    
very small house with a bed-sitting    
room,kitchenette and shower room to    
70,000 for a 4-bedroomed detached house
with double garage.
