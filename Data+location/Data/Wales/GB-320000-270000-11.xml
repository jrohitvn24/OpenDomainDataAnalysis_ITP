		<title>11Llangunllo Police</title>
		<content>   Llangunllo is policed from Knighton,
 the nearest town. A panda car visits  
 the centre of the village once a week 
 to see if there are any problems.     
   Llangunllo is a very law abiding    
 place.It is possible to leave your    
 house or your car unlocked and expect 
 them to be untouched when you return. 
 The bery compact nature of the        
 community mitigates against           
 criminality. Occasionally there are   
 idiotic acts performed, usually by    
 local boys having drunk too much _    
 mild vaddalism,such as moving         
 somebody's ornamental trees around but
 the only real criminal acts are       
 performed seasonally by sheep         
 rustlers, who came from outside the   
 local community.
