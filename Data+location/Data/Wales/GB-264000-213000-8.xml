		<content> Outlined below are detailed           
 descriptions of two playground games  
 played by the children of Glanaman.   
                                       
{A. BRITISH BULLDOGS.}                 
    Players stand in a line. One person
 is chosen as 'it' and stands in front 
 of the others. This person says,      
 "British Bulldogs 1 2 3," and all the 
 players have to run past him or her to
 another point. Anyone caught becomes  
 'it.'                                 
{B. I SENT A LETTER TO MY FRIEND AND ON
{   THE WAY I LOST IT.}                
    Players sit in a circle. The person
 who is 'it' picks up a 'letter' and   
 runs around the circle, dropping the  
 letter behind a player. When the      
 letter is discovered the player has to
 get up and chase the peson who is     
 'it.' If 'it' is caught he has to sit 
 in the circle, sucking his thumb.     </content>
