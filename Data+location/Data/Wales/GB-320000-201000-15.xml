 We belong to the "Tillery Tigers"     
 which is the local mini rugby club.Any
 one between the ages of 7and12 can    
 join the club.We play up at           
 Abertillery Park every Sunday.If it is
 tournament day we play from 9.00am to 
 3.30pm,if there is no tournament we   
 play from 10.15am to 12.15pm.At Easter
 we played two tour matches against    
 Gloucester which we won,4-0 and 16-4. 
 At the end of the season we had a     
 certificate and a trophy.In the local 
 competions we reached the semi-final  
 but were beaten by Abergavenny.We     
 enjoy our rugby because it keeps us   
 fit we would like to play flanker and 
 forward prop for Wales.
