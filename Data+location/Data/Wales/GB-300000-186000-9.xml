		<title>09GELLI RHAIDD UCHAF FARM</title>
		<content> As we walked up the lane to the farm  
 the sun was beating down on us. Rees  
 went ahead to tell his parents that   
 we were coming. His mother came out   
 with some orange pop for us.          
   Then we went to look at the cows.   
 There were{Limousel}cows which came   
 from{France}and{Rhondda Herd Welsh    
{Black,both of which are beef cows.    
   Then we went over to the shed where 
 the sheep are sheared.We saw Rees's   
 brother shear two sheep and then let  
 them run outside.He gave the sheep's  
 wool to Rees to roll up.Rees's sister 
 showed us how to roll up the fleece.  
 She told us to put the dirty side on  
 the outside and to fold the sides in. 
 Then Rees's brother caught a sheep    
 which he had sheared and put it in a  
 pen on its own,ready for slaughter.   
    After that we said thankyou to Mr  
 Jones and his wife and we walked back.</content>
