		<title>09Farming concerns in Caerhun</title>
		<content> The community is Welsh-speaking,      
 closely-knit, industrious and keen to 
 help each other.Farmers' wives use    
 modern appliances for household tasks.
 They shop in Llanrwst, a traditional  
 market town. It is felt that home     
 industries and improved roads might   
 attract young families into the       
 community and prevent it becoming a   
 dormitory area for nearby towns. All  
 farmers would like to increase their  
 farms' holdings and profitability.    
 Those that are tenants would like to  
 buy their farms. Farm workers' wages  
 are high so farmers rely for help on  
 their families who are prepared to    
 work long, irregular hours. Conserv-  
 ationists insist on preserving rare   
 plants e.g. orchids, flax so some land
 use is lost but compensation is avail-
 able. Problems are caused by walkers  
 damaging walls and leaving gates open.</content>
