		<content>   Salem village forms the focal  point
 of this area.  It is agricultural  and
 except for the village,  very sparsely
 populated.  The farms are either self-
 sufficient  units of about  100 acres,
 or  smallholdings,    run by  families
 whose  main income stems from  outside
 the area.                             
   The  village  consists  of    people
 connected with agriculture, mainly the
 original Welsh inhabitants,   together
 with commuters; men who work elsewhere
 leaving their families in the area.   
   There  are  therefore  two  distinct
 social groups,   and these are further
 divided by the language.  The original
 inhabitants of farms and village speak
 Welsh;most of the newcomers speak only
 English.   The identity of the area is
 thus changing from a  self- sufficient
 rural community  into a  commuter belt
 district of Llandeilo and beyond.     </content>
