 David Williams lives at 11, Chapel St,
 Aberaman. He is 20 years old and has  
 been unemployed since leaving school  
 at 16. He is a typical example of the 
 many young unemployed people in       
 Aberdare. He now receives Â£23.50 per  
 week,paid fortnightly. He gives some  
 money to his parents and with the     
 little left over he buys an L.P. or   
 some clothes to cheer him up. He      
 describes a typical day in one word - 
 "boring"! He visits the job centre    
 twice a week,watches T.V. and goes for
 long walks.                           
  He, like so many others in the same  
 situation,expressed anger,frustration 
 and despondency. "Looking for a       
 permanent job is like looking for     
 diamonds in the River Cynon," says    
 David. He feels depressed and that he 
 has been let down by society.         </content>
