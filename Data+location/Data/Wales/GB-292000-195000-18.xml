		<title>18CHANGES IN THE VILLAGES</title>
		<content> MRS.HUGHES,A TEACHER IN THE LOCALITY, 
 WHEN INTERVIEWED REFERRED TO THE      
 HUSTLE,BUSTLE AND ACTIVITY IN THE     
 VILLAGES DUE TO WORK AT TWO LARGE COAL
 MINES,THE PARC AND THE DARE . BUSES   
 CARRYING MINERS RATTLED DAILY UP THE  
 MAIN ROAD.                            
{THE MAJOR CHANGE}HAS BEEN THE CLOSURE 
 OF THE COAL MINES AND PEOPLE HAVE LEFT
 THE VILLAGES TO FIND WORK.THE AREA IS 
 QUIETER AND CLEANER.THE BLACK SILT    
 FROM THE WASHED COAL NO LONGER FLOWS  
 IN THE RIVER.A FORESTATION HAS        
 TRANSFORMED THE MOUNTAIN SIDES.       
{THE SECOND CHANGE}HAS BEEN THE DECLINE
 IN THE WELSH CHAPELS,WITH ONLY A      
 TRICKLE OF OLDER PEOPLE ATTENDING     
 THEM.ONLY THE ROWS OF TERRACED HOUSES 
 REMIND US OF CWMPARC AND TREORCHY'S   
 GREAT STORY,BUT IT STILL RETAINES ITS 
 COMMUNITY AND CARING SPIRIT.          
                                       </content>
