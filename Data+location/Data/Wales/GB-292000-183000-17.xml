		<title>17Footpaths.</title>
		<content>  One of the joys of living in this    
 district is the variety of delightful 
 country walks. Public footpaths criss 
 -cross the area, some twisting and    
 turning through lush,green fields and 
 others meandering through cool, leafy 
 woods.                                
  Open-cast mining in the late '60s and
 early '70s obliterated many of these  
 paths. The land has been returned to  
 its natural beauty and it is the duty 
 of everyone to walk these paths to    
 ensure that they remain accessible to 
 the public. In this way we can make   
 certain that the rights of everyone to
 enjoy the beauty of the countryside is
 preserved.                            
  It is important to remember that     
 these rights also bring obligations.  
 We must remember to obey the country  
 code when walking the paths.
