		<title>01Summary of the Area</title>
		<content>    The D-block examined is            
 predominately residential though as   
 revealed in the land cover survey     
 large areas are given over to farming,
 mostly dairy or cattle rearing.       
    The block is bisected by the M4    
 motorway (east- west) and the River   
 Tawe (north - south).Alongside the    
 river at Ynysforgan a new by-pass is  
 currently under construction.         
    One of the most important features 
 of the area is the Driver and Vehicle 
 Licensing Centre, a major employer    
 with approximately 5000 people working
 there.                                
    Good road links with the city of   
 Swansea and an attractive outlook has 
 meant expansion of housing in the area
 with new housing estates and a new    
 school being completed within the last
 ten years.
