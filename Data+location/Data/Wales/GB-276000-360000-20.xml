		<content> Flooding in the valley has been a     
 problem for many years. The river is  
 tidal to Trefriw. Great volumes of    
 water run off the mountains and       
 when these meet high tide water large 
 areas are flooded.Low-flying aircraft 
 from  RAF Valley Anglesey on radar    
 avoidance practice make a  great deal 
 of noise, some of it very sudden when 
 speeds exceed that of sound.
