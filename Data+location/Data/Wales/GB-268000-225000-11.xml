		<content> At school we play many games.Here are 
 some of their names Nip and Run,      
 British Bull Dogs,Chain,Rounders and  
 Three,Two,One.In Nip and Run we have  
 one wicket near the wall and another  
 opposite in the middle of the yard.   
 Sombody has a cricket bat and one     
 bowls.If the the person bats or nips  
 the ball with the bat,that person has 
 to run to the other wicket before     
 somebody hits it with the ball.If     
 aperson gets the batter out another   
 person is in.When we play Chain we use
 a big yard.One person is on it and has
 to catch the other people. After he's 
 caught some they all hold hands.The   
 last one left is on it next.In Three, 
 Two,One someone is on it.That person  
 must stay on one side of the yard.The 
 other people must line up on the other
 side.The person that is on it must    
 turn round and face the wall.         </content>
