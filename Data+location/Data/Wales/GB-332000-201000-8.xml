		<title>08DIALYSING AT LITTLE MILL</title>
		<content>  I moved to Little Mill in 1976 and   
 obtained a kidney dialysis machine for
 home use,my kidneys having failed in  
 1974.Dialysis is a method of cleansing
 the blood of electrolytes and removing
 excess water from the bloodstream.This
 operation is done by inserting two    
 large needles into one's veins,one    
 vessel arterial and the other venous. 
 Blood then flows through connecting   
 tubing to an artificial kidney,helped 
 by a pump and returned to the body.The
 process takes six hours repeated three
 times per week.                       
 The kidney machine relys on a good    
 pressured supply of water,filtered and
 softened.It uses 19 gallons each      
 session.Electricity is also required  
 and should a cut in supply occur I    
 have to disconnect myself quickly and 
 return what blood I can to my body by 
 gravity feed.                         </content>
