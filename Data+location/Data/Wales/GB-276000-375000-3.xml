		<content>{Plas Mawr}on the High Street in Conwy 
 is famous for the ghost in its        
 Lantern Room.{Robert Wynne,}a         
 wealthy merchant and master of the    
 house was away and his wife was       
 awaiting his return on the step of the
 house with her son and expectant child
   On her way down the High Street they
 both fell down the stairs where later 
 her housemaid found her and her son.  
   She called for the doctor but the   
 one who came wasn't the normal family 
 doctor. They locked him in the lantern
 room with the bodies to deal with     
 them . When he heard of Robert Wynne  
 returning he hid up the chimney as he 
 knew that he coundn't do anything for 
 the two of them. To this day Wynne is 
 supposed to walk around the room      
 looking for the doctor.
