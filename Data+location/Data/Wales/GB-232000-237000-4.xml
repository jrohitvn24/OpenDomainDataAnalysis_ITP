		<title>04THE WOOLLEN INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> At the beginning of the century the   
 villages of Drefach and Velindre were 
 noted throughout the country because  
 of the woollen industry.There were    
 twenty three factories dotted along   
 the banks of the four streams-Arthen, 
 Bran, Esgair, Bargod,-that flow       
 nearby and nineteen weaving shops in  
 the two villages.There were numerous  
 men, women and children busy carding, 
 weaving and spinning in their own     
 homes. But the golden era of the      
 industry came to an end after the     
 First World War.But the tradition     
 still lives in the district and three 
 factories are still working-Dolwerdd, 
 Dyffryn and Melin Teifi. The Museum of
 the Welsh Woollen Industry,which is a 
 branch of the Welsh Industrial and    
 Maritime Museum was recently opened at
 the Cambrian Mill building. Old       
 machinery and documents are on display</content>
