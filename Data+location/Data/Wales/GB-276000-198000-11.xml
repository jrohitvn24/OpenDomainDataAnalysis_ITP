		<title>11   'IN YEARS GONE BY'</title>
		<content>    Mrs.Rees is 80 years old and she   
 has lived in Tonna all her life.She   
 was born at 53,Henfaes Terr. and she  
 went to the old Tonna school.         
    She remembers many things about    
 that school.At playtime she used to   
 play Hopscotch,Skipping and Rounders. 
 During lesson time they learned the   
 alphabet,followed by letter sounds,   
 tables,sums,music,writing and reading.
     They didn't have a school uniform 
 like us and everyone wore what their  
 parents could afford.The boys wore    
 boots with nails in and everyone kept 
 their best clothes for special        
 occasions.                            
     She also remembers V.E.Day when   
 everyone was dancing in the streets.  
 Tonna is always a happy place,although
 it has changed a great deal.A change  
 for the better perhaps!!........
