		<title>14MONKSWOOD WATCH</title>
		<content> At first sight nothing seems to happen
 in Monkswood but on deeper thought    
 there are many neighbourly gestures we
 take for granted.                     
 Because the bus service is curtailed, 
 neighbours are generous with their    
 cars so that shopping and             
 prescriptions can be collected and    
 library books changed regularly.Old   
 folk are visited;pets whose owners are
 away,are cared for;children are met   
 from the school bus if "mum"is        
 delayed.Excess garden produce and     
 plants are exchanged over the garden  
 fence together with gossip.The menfolk
 are ready to help by lending tools and
 skills.                               
 The church has a small regular        
 congregation with numbers increasing  
 for special services.                 
 People are kind and generous,always   
 willing to offer help when necessary. </content>
