		<title>05LLANSTEFFAN AREA: BEHAVIOUR</title>
		<content> Llansteffan and Llanybri villages are 
 only 2 miles apart and are one parish 
 so they have been closely linked.     
 There is traditionally a slight       
 antagonism - "the posh people live in 
 Llansteffan and the servants came from
 Llanybri" is quoted. Nevertheless     
 there are within and between both     
 communities strong bonds of           
 neighbourliness. We all know one      
 another and many are interrelated.    
 Nobody in distress of any sort need   
 feel alone or neglected. Newcomers to 
 the area are soon integrated. Of      
 course quarrels and disagreements     
 occur, but politics, religion,        
 language, the usual bones of          
 contention, arouse no strong passions 
 here. This doesn't mean that a bland  
 indifference prevails. Welsh people   
 are generally volatile and            
 lively-minded; we are no exception.   </content>
