		<content> Much of the area is dominated by Fridd
 cocyn hill that leads down to the     
 valley coastal plains of Afon Dylynni 
 on its north/west side and Afon Fathew
 on its South.  Once again, the land is
 covered by grass, heath and moorland  
 and used primarily for sheep an catle 
 grazing.  There are quite a few       
 farmsteads in this section and the two
 small villages of Llanegryn in square 
 1, and Bryncrug in square 9.  Bryncrug
 lies off the A493 road between        
 Dolgellan and Tywyn, and is           
 representative of the many vilages in 
 the area - stone and slate            
 construction situated around numerous 
 churches with localy                  
 shop/food/service stores.  The        
 independent Talyllyn railway runs     
 along the valley floor of Afon Fathew 
 with Brynglas Station in square 11.   
 This is a one track railway for locals</content>
