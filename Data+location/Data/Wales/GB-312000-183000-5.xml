		<content> The village has a population of 8,000 
 and is essentially a linear trading   
 area along Cardiff Road.   The south  
 west corner is dominated by waste     
 ground and  a small housing estate    
 bounded by the River Taff.   The local
 rugby ground is also situated here.   
 The railway line runs parallel to the 
 river and the major industries are    
 situated to the east.   New housing   
 estates dominate the north east corner
 and the woodland of Fforest Fawr can  
 be found to the south of these        
 estates.   The major industries in the
 area include a large metal            
 manufacturing plant and several       
 engineering works.   There is  also a 
 small industrial estate situated      
 between the railway line and the A470.
