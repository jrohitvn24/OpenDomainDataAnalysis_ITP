		<content> I get up at 7.30 and have my breakfast
 of cereal.I leave the house at 8.30   
 and walk to school.                   
 School starts at 9.00.We start the    
 morning with hymns and prayers in the 
 hall and the rest of the morning is   
 taken up with maths,and English.We    
 have play at 10.40 and finish for     
 dinner at 12.00.                      
 After dinner we start school at 1.30. 
 We do Geography or History ,Games and 
 Art.Very often we use the video and   
 television to see different programmes
 Playtime is at 3.00 and we go home at 
 4.00.                                 
 I sometimes stay at school to take    
 part in Athletics or gymnnastics.When 
 I go home I have a cooked meal and    
 then I go out to call for my friend   
 Lisa or go and play in the park.I go  
 to bed at 9.15.
