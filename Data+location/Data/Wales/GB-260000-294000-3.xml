		<content>    During the summer months the       
 pretty wharf and jetty area is a hive 
 of activity.Attractively located in   
 the village centre it looks out across
 the busy estuary towards Borth.It     
 also  provides the many young visitors
 to the resort with a perfect spot from
 which to enjoy crabbing.              
    It continues to be dominated by two
 large wooden buildings originally     
 built as storage sheds but now        
 occupied by the Outward Bound School  
 and the R.N.L.I.inshore rescue boat.A 
 small sailing museum is also housed in
 these buildings.                      
    Redeveloped in the late 1960's it  
 gained a Prince of Wales Award for    
 Environmental Improvement and now     
 boasts an Information Centre,public   
 shelter,Harbour Masters Office,public 
 toilets,neatly laid out gardens and   
 the Dovey Sailing Club's clubhouse.   </content>
