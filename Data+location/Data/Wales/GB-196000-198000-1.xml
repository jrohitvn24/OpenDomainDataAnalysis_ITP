 The survey area is immediately to the 
 south,south-east and south-west of the
 town of{Pembroke.}It contains part of 
 the village of{Hundleton}and the      
 hamlet of{Maiden Wells,}but consists  
 almost entirely of farmland.          
  This area,of the new county of{Dyfed,
 is partiularly beautiful and has a    
 large influx of tourists during the   
 summer season.To the south,east and   
 west are many well used beaches and   
 areas of scenic beauty,and to the     
 north is{Pembroke,}dominated by its   
 very fine Norman castle.              
  The area has been surveyed by the    
 fourth year pupils of{Priory Junior   
{School,Monkton,Pembroke;}which is     
 situated just to the north of the     
 survey area.
