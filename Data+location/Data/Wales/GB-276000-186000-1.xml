		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>      Situated on a narrow strip of    
 land between sea and mountains; is our
 home town of Port Talbot. It is an    
 industrial town, dominated by a vast  
 steel works.                          
      Our area consists of two         
 sections, within the town, called     
 MARGAM and TAIBACH which are          
 predominently taken up by the steel   
 complex. These, together with         
 BAGLAN,CWMAVON,BRYN, GOYTRE,          
 ABERAVON,CYMMER and GLYNCORRWG form   
 the Borough of Port Talbot. With the  
 area of Aberavon containing a 3 mile  
 long sandy beach.                     
     Running directly through the town 
 is the old trunk road, the A48, which 
 was a major transportation link before
 the new M4 motorway was created.      
 Because of its docks and accessibility
 the town grew and seemed to crystalise
 around the trunk road.                </content>
