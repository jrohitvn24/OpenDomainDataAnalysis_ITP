		<title>05Alyn Valley Wildlife (1)</title>
		<content> In this area a number of differing    
 habitats are represented and so a     
 great variety of wildlife is found.   
 On the moorland of the Clwydian Hills 
 birds such as meadow pipits,grouse and
 kestrels may be seen. The coniferous  
 plantations provide a home for gold-  
 crests and crossbills and are a refuge
 for foxes. The hedgerows in the valley
 are of benefit to nesting birds, while
 the hedge-banks support a wealth of   
 wild flowers and also provide homes   
 for mice, voles and shrews. The woods,
 being on limestone, support a rich    
 flora, including a number of species  
 of wild orchids. Birds and animals    
 found here include woodpeckers, owls, 
 tree-creepers,grey squirrels, badgers,
 grass-snakes, adders and lizards. The 
 River Alyn supports fish and a varied 
 invertebrate fauna, and birds such as 
 grey wagtails and dippers are common. </content>
