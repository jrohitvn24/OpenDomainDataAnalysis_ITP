 When asked if he would have liked to  
 have had a different occupation or to 
 have lived somewhere else he was      
 adamant that he would not have been   
 happier living elsewhere nor in any   
 other form of employment. He enjoys   
 living in Llanychaer and his favourite
 leisure time occupation is reading    
 historical books and carpentry.       
 He proudly showed us a gold pocket    
 watch that had been presented to him  
 for full attendance at Barham         
 Voluntary School.During his childhood,
 it was rare for a child to attend     
 school regularly.He walked 8 miles    
 daily,as many other children did, but 
 there were many illnesses and children
 would have long absences from school.
