		<content> tarry.This being so it is necessary   
 for it to be pumped through a double  
 skinned pipeline, the outer section   
 being used to pump steam through at 40
 degrees centigrade to keep it runny   
 enough to travel.It is then stored in 
 4 tanks each holding 1600 tonnes (one 
 days supply) at a current cost of Â£170
 per tonne.This oil is then run under  
 pressure through 32 burner rods to    
 each of 4 boilers.The steam produced  
 by these boilers is then used to turn 
 the huge turbines.The water used is   
 filtered from the nearby sea          
 through huge screens to remove all    
 large debris,then treated chemically  
 to remove any unwanted items.The stack
 used for the removal of waste gases is
 210 metres high.It's diameter at the  
 base is 21 metres and at the top 16   
 metres.It moves about one third of a  
 metre at the top in high winds.       </content>
