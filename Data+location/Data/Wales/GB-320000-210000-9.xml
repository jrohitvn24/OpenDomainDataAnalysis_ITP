 First I will start with the shop in   
 the village.It is a small shop and    
 sells all kinds of different things   
 mostly food.It sells groceries besides
 cards,sweets,meat,vegetables fresh and
 canned,drinks and fruit etc.          
 We also have a community centre.it is 
 a big hall where adults play bingo and
 on Tuesdays,Wednesdays and Thursdays a
 youth club is held for children eleven
 and over.                             
 Then there is a pub called the Jolly  
 Colliers.It has a lounge and a bar    
 like most pubs have.                  
 We have an infants school and a junior
 school on different sides of the road.
 The infants school is made out of     
 brick and the junior school is made   
 out of stone.                         
 We have got houses that are old and   
 houses that are quite new.(cont.p.10) </content>
