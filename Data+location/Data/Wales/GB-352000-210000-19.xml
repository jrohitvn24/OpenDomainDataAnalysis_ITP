		<content> A GROUP OF CHILDREN FROM WYESHAM      
 JUNIOR SCHOOL VISITED STAUNTON CHURCH 
 ON JUNE 26TH 1985.                    
 We arrived at the mainly{Norman Church
 at Staunton. At the front is an old   
 Norman font. At the back of the Church
 is a fairly new English font.Near the 
 nave are six bell ropes. The pulpit   
 has a spiral staircase which led to a 
 former rood screen. We tried to find  
{David Mushet's}tombstone but we had no
 luck. He invented the{Bessemer process
 for making steel.
