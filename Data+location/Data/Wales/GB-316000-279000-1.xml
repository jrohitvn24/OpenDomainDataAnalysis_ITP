		<title>01  THE PARISH OF BEGUILDY</title>
		<content>                                       
 The area which we are studying is in  
 the parish of Beguildy and comprises  
 the villages of Beguildy and Felindre.
 The river runs along the eastern edge 
 of the parish and forms part of the   
 border between England and Wales. The 
 valley has steep sides, rising to a   
 height of over five hundred metres. It
 is a rural area with numerous small   
 farms specialising in rearing sheep   
 and store cattle.                     
    The river meanders considerably on 
 its route through the valley and      
 causes problems of erosion in several 
 areas. During this survey the highways
 department are busily changing the    
 course of the river at a point between
 Beguildy and Felindre because of      
 damage to the road. Lower down the    
 valley a scheme is in operation to    
 move the roadway away from the river. </content>
