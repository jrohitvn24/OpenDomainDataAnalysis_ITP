		<title>13HOLY TRINTY CHURCH,GWERSYLLT</title>
		<content>     This is the parish church.        
 Gwersyllt,Summerhill,Bradley and      
 Rhosrobin are in this parish.         
     Before 1850{Gwersyllt}was in the  
 parish of Gresford.People walked three
 miles to Gresford Church.             
     The population of Gwersyllt grew  
 as a result of coal mining in the     
 middle of the 1800's.The new parish   
 church was built with money raised    
 from local people.                    
    {Mr.Thomas Penson}designed the     
 building,which was begun in 1849 and  
 completed in 1851.Local limestone was 
 used in the construction.             
     The bells of the church were given
 as a memorial for those men of the    
 parish who died in the First World    
 War.Their names appear on a memorial  
 plaque below the tower.the names of   
 those killed in the Second World War  
 were added later.                     </content>
