		<title>06 A Sixth-Former's View</title>
		<content>  I am studying 'A' level History,     
English and Economics hoping to gain   
the necessary qualifications to enter  
further education or a career.         
  The work at 'A' level is much harder 
than at 'O' level and the methods of   
teaching are more relaxed and informal.
Pupils are required to work on their   
own which demands more self-discipline.
The classes are smaller but we are     
expected to be more mature and         
responsible.                           
  The sixth former is expected to set  
an example to the rest of the school   
and I have to carry out numerous       
prefect duties.                        
  As well as academic studies I take   
part in a community programme at an old
people's home which is a most rewarding
experience. The sixth former has an    
important role in maintaining the high 
reputation of our school.              </content>
