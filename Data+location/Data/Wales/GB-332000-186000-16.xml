		<title>16THE SOUTH WALES ARGUS.</title>
		<content>      The South Wales Argus is the only
 major evening paper in Gwent. It has  
 now been in production for nearly 40  
 years. It is printed in Duffryn and   
 has smaller sites scattered all over  
 Gwent. The Argus has all the daily    
 major information in it for South     
 Wales and it sometimes has National   
 News in it. This information is always
 set out in a set pattern. The first 5 
 to 6 pages contain all the main       
 headlines. The next few pages are used
 for Births, Deaths and Marriages. Then
 comes several pages of Advertisememts.
 The last few pages are used for sports
 headliness and they also give the     
 local football, cricket, snooker and  
 darts tables.
