		<title>14Cheese Market Poem (English)</title>
		<content> The translation of "Marchnad Caws     
 Caerffili" is:                        
                                       
 "There was nought to be heard but     
 Cheese ! Cheese ! all the time,       
 Yes, Cheese ! Cheese and cheese !     
 without ending,                       
 I verily thought that the people of   
 Wales                                 
 On nothing but cheese were depending. 
 Were you to heap up every cheese upon 
 cheese,                               
 And I to climb up had the power,      
 I could change the moon every noon    
 with great ease,                      
 From the top of Caerphilly's cheese   
 tower."                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
