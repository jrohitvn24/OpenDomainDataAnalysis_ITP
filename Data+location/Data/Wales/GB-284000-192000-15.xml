		<title>15Sports in Caerau</title>
		<content>{Football}is the main sport in         
{Caerau. To}develop this interest in   
 sport Brian Williams and a            
 group of interested people in 1977 set
 up a committee and formed             
 the{Caerau Boys Club.}The club meets  
 once a week to train. In 1984 the     
 most successful team were the under   
 14's which were beaten only twice. As 
{cricket}is not one of the most popular
 games in Caerau not many people play  
 but Martin Wiltshire a former pupil of
 Blaencaerau School has gone on to     
 play for Wales. Our national sport in 
 Wales is rugby. In the last twelve    
 months there have been two boys from  
 Caerau capped for the Wales youth.    
 In 1985 Blaencaerau third year mini   
 rugby team won through to the national
 finals at{Cardiff Arms Park.
