		<title>20Plasgwernfadog Hotel</title>
		<content>   John Player built Plasgwernfadog as 
 a present for his son Percy. Percy    
 lived there with his wife. It was     
 built before 1914 so it is at least   
 seventy years old.                    
   The house was built of red sandstone
 and limestone. The window panes are   
 very small but some of the windows    
 have modern double glazing. I think it
 spoils the building. They should put  
 the old windows back!                 
   Today, Mr. W.Hughes owns the house  
 and uses it as an hotel. He has not   
 changed the interior very much though 
 he has put a bar in the entrance hall 
 for guests. In the dining room there  
 are chandeliers and a church organ.   
 Upstairs there are many bedrooms and I
 suppose Mr Hughes put the double      
 glazing in to keep the rooms warm and 
 comfortable. The hotel is the only one
 in the Morriston area.                </content>
