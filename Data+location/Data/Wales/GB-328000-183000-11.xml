		<content> At{Tredegar House}there are the       
 following facilities _ the house      
 itself,the red pond and orangery,craft
 shops,donkey rides,a caravan park,a   
 snack bar,boating,cafe,playing area   
 and toilets.                          
 Four people who were interviewed came 
 from Roathe in Cardiff. They all      
 thought that it was a lovely place.   
 They felt that it would be improved by
 adding peacocks,more flower gardens   
 and by returning the childrens farm.  
 Another person who was interviewed    
 lived in Newport. He loved the area   
 but thought that more wildlife could  
 be added.                             
 The first group of people thought that
 there was need of a second car park,  
 especially one for buses. They also   
 felt that the caravan park was very   
 short of basic amenities,e.g. showers.
