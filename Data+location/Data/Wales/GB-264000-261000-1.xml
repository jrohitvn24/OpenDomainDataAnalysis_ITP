		<content>  Area bilingual. Native tongue welsh  
 but english becoming predominate. Due 
 to height &amp; nature of area, farming   
 mostly sheep, some dairy. Stone       
 cottages &amp; farms. Very few brick built
 buildings. Many homes &amp; farms not on  
 mains water or mains sewage systems.  
 Some without bathroom &amp; toilets.      
 Antique furniture restoration,        
 toymaking, macrame &amp; pony trekking are
 typical cottage industries. Old skills
 kept going such as wool dyeing &amp;      
 spinning, hedging, ditching, drystone 
 walling. Social life is provided by   
 membership to Women's Institute &amp;     
 young farmers club type institutions. 
 Also by forming groups with common    
 interests such as handicraft groups,  
 welsh learners etc. Bus that runs     
 through sections 5 &amp; 6 is operated by 
 the post office from Aberystwyth.
