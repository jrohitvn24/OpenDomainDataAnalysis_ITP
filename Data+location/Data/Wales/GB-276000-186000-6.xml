		<content>      The residential buildings have   
 been created on either side of what   
 was the main trunk road.              
      Within the area there is a       
 mixture of both private and council   
 houses both of which have been present
 for many years. Over the past few     
 years there have been a few additions 
 to the private sector with people     
 building their own houses in what ever
 space is available.                   
      In another part of the town,     
 (ABERAVON) there is a vast council    
 estate called SANDFIELDS ESTATE that  
 was built to take the overflow of     
 people coming into the area with the  
 increase in industrial activity.      
      Throughout the borough council   
 tennants have been given the option of
 buying their houses. Many have taken  
 up this option.
