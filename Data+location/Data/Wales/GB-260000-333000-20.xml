		<content>  The language of the majority of the  
 people living in the area is Welsh.   
 People go about their daily lives     
 through the medium of Welsh, in work, 
 at play and children at school learn  
 mainly through using the Welsh        
 language.                             
  During recent years more English     
 families have moved into the area as  
 owners of second homes or have moved  
 in and settled here.                  
  Over the years the Welsh people have 
 become bilingual and children at      
 school find little difficulty in      
 mastering both languages by the age of
 eleven.                               
  Welsh is widely used and is strongly 
 reflected in the culture and pastimes 
 of people in the area.However the     
 number of Welsh speakers is declining 
 but there is a strong awareness for   
 the need to preserve our language.    </content>
