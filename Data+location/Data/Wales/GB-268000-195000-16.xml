		<title>16LOCAL HISTORY AND CHANGE</title>
		<content> We interviewed Miss Bodycombe and Mr  
 Lloyd Jones,who have lived in the area
 around the school all of their lives. 
 They told us of the many changes that 
 have taken place.Here are some of     
 them.                                 
 1.All around this area there were     
 green fields and farms,with just a few
 houses dotted here and there.The      
 copper smelting industry,which had    
 ruined the green Swansea valley had   
 not spoilt the beauty of this area.   
 Gradually since the war many council  
 estates had been built in Winchwen,   
 Bonymaen,Trallwn,Talycopa and         
 Llansamlet.These estates swallowed up 
 the green fields.                     
 2.There was a private track leading   
 through the present site of our       
 school.This was owned by Squire Smith 
 and it led from his mansion at Gwern  
 Llwynchwyth house to a summer house.  </content>
