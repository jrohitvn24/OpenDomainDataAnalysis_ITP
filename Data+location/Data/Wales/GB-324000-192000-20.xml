		<title>20OUR LOCALITY</title>
		<content> We looked at the areas around us. A   
 generation ago the land was farm      
 land,open spaces and wooded areas.    
 Today much of the land is covered by  
 large, modern housing estates and many
 of the land marks have disappeared.   
 Many of the local estates have taken  
 their names from the farms they are   
 built upon.We wondered why these      
 estates have mushroomed during the    
 last generation, so we decided to find
 out when the families in our class    
 came to Cwmbran.The families fell into
 2 groups ,families who have been here 
 for more than 3 generations + families
 who came to live here in the last few 
 years.Both parents born in Cwmbran 5, 
 one parent born in Cwmbran 4,neither  
 parent born locally 19.1/4 of those   
 surveyed have moved to Cwmbran in last
 9 years.This suggests Cwmbran is still
 an expanding New Town.       CLASS.2  </content>
