		<content> The Parish Church of St. John was     
 built in 1886 at the expense of Miss  
 Clara Thomas of Pencerrig and cost    
 Â£12,000. Between 1886 and 1962 there  
 were 3 vicars but after 1962 St.John's
 was grouped with Llanelwedd,          
 Llanfaredd, Llansaintfraid, Cregina   
 and Bettws churches, all sharing one  
 vicar,residing in Llanelwedd Rectory. 
 Regrouping in 1984 meant that St.     
 John's joined Newbridge, Llanafon and 
 Llanfihangel-Brynpabuan sharing one   
 vicar who lives in Newbridge-on-Wye   
 Vicarage. After the Second World War  
 attendances began to dwindle and now  
 at the one service held each Sunday in
 St. John's, the average gathering is  
 made up of about 14 women, no children
 and one or 2 men.The present bell-    
 ringer, Miss May Morgan is 93 years   
 old and is the oldest bell-ringer in  
 Wales.                                </content>
