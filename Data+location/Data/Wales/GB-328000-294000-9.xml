   Hyssington Church is dedicated to   
{St Etheldreda a Saxon Princess}who    
 became an abbess. Although the first  
 record of a church at the present site
 is 13th Century it is very likely that
 a church existed here in late Saxon   
 times. The circular Churchyard could  
 perhaps have been part of the{Motte   
{and Bailey castle}which overlooks the 
 Church. The present building was      
 restored in the 1890's.               
   In 1985 the Electoral roll is 23.   
  Collection in the last year amounted 
 to Â£599.                              
   The parish is grouped with          
 Churchstoke and our Vicar is also     
 Vicar of Chuchstoke and Sarn.
