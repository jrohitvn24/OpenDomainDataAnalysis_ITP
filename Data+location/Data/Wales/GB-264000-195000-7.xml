		<title>07MORRISTON ORPHEUS, SWANSEA</title>
		<content>   The Morriston Orpheus Choir was     
 founded in 1935 by Ivor Sims. It has  
 about 100 members, ranging up to 75   
 years of age. It is an all-male choir,
 except for the accompanist.           
   The choir celebrated its 50th.      
 anniversary this year by entering the 
 Nancy Festival with other choirs from 
 all over Europe. The celebration      
 continues later in the year when they 
 visit Germany.                        
   The choir has won competitions all  
 over the world, including the Welsh   
 National Eisteddfod, and has had the  
 honour of appearing before royalty,-  
 the Prince of Wales and Princess      
 Diana. Tours have been made to        
 America, Europe, and all over Britain.
 The choir has made records and        
 television appearances and given many 
 charity concerts. Their singing is    
 perhaps the best in the world.        </content>
