 LOTS OF TOURISTS COME TO THIS AREA    
 WHICH AFFECTS THE LOCAL PEOPLE A LOT, 
 ESPECIALLY THE SHOPKEEPERS WHO SELL   
 MORE IN THE TOURIST SEASON.           
    THE SHOPKEEPERS SELL MANY MORE     
 THINGS TO TOURISTS.   SOME SHOPS SELL 
 SPECIAL PRODUCTS TO TOURISTS LIKE     
 BEACH SHOES AND TOYS.   THE CRAFT     
 SHOPS GET THE MOST TOURISTS BECAUSE   
 MOST OF THE TOURISTS WOULD RATHER BUY 
 SOUVENIRS OF THEIR STAY.   THE        
 SHOPKEEPERS ARE FRIENDLY TO THE       
 TOURISTS AND HELP THEM A LOT BY       
 SHOWING THEM PLACES TO GO.   SOME     
 LOCAL PEOPLE DO BED AND BREAKFAST AND 
 RUN GUEST HOUSES.   THE ATTITUDE OF   
 THE LOCAL PEOPLE CHANGES WHEN THE     
 TOURISTS DROP LITTER AND SPOIL THE    
 AREA AND BEACHES.LOCAL PEOPLE SEEM TO 
 BE MORE AWARE OF RETAINING THE BEAUTY 
 OF THE AREA THAN THE TOURISTS.        </content>
