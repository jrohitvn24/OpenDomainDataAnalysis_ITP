		<title>07   NEATH AND TENNANT CANAL.</title>
		<content>        The plans for the go-ahead of  
 the{Neath Canal}was given by the      
 Government in{1791}and it was built in
{1795}.They built the Neath Canal to   
 carry manufacted goods and coal from  
 the valleys down to Neath.It starts at
{Glynneath}and finishes in{Briton Ferry
       {The Tennant Canal}was built by 
 George Tennant in{1824}and it starts  
 at{Aberdulais}and finishes at{Swansea 
{Port.}Aberdulais Basin in the Thirties
 was therefore a very busy place,as    
 both canals met here.The Neath Canal  
 also went over the Neath River here by
 flowing over an aquaduct.             
  Gradually the mines started to close 
 and by the late 30's the canal and tow
 paths were overgrown.They stayed that 
 way until the{Neath and Tennant Canal 
{Preservation Society}was formed in{Aug
{1974.}Their work was rewarded in{1979 
 with the{Prince of Wales Award.       </content>
