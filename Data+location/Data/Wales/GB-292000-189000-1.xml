		<title>01Ogmore Vale And Wyndham.</title>
		<content>  The former coal mining communities of
 Ogmore Vale and Wyndham,in the Ogmore 
 Valley were established along the     
 valley bottom and the lower slopes of 
 mountains which rise to a height of   
 over 400 metres. Terracing is the     
 dominant feature of house building.   
  The adult population has declined to 
 about 2445. Lack of employment        
 oppurtunities being the main reason.  
  Notable buildings include the now    
 empty Gwalia Stores.                  
  The most ancient buildings are the   
 farmhouses and sheep farming which    
 predates any other means of earning a 
 living is carried on.                 
  A further feature of the area is a   
 large conifer plantation called the   
 Ogmore Forest. The largest remaining  
 area of natural broadleaved woodland  
 is the Aber Woods.
