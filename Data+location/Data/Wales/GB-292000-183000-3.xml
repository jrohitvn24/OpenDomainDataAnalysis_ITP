		<content>  Our school is in High St. in the     
 centre of the village. It is a        
 friendly school where everybody knows 
 everyone else. 73 children attend the 
 school although Mr. George remembers  
 the time when there were over 200     
 pupils.                               
  Mr. George is our Headmaster and     
 teaches the Junior Class in the       
 morning whilst Mrs. Phillips teaches  
 the class each afternoon. Mrs.        
 Tatchell teaches the Transition Class 
 and Mrs. McCann the Infants Class.    
  Each morning we have Maths, English  
 and Welsh and in the afternoon we do  
 Project Work ,which includes History, 
 Geography and Science. We also study  
 Art/Craft, Music, R.E. etc.           
  Mr. George retires this term after   
 teaching here for 35 years. We will be
 sorry to see him leave. Mrs. Tatchell 
 will be our new Head Teacher.(Gr.D)N.p</content>
