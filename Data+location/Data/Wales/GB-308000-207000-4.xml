		<content>  Great efforts have been made, in the 
 last decade or so, to erase the scars 
 left by the Industrialists of the 18th
 and 19th Centuries.Much of the        
 countryside was used as an industrial 
 tipping ground, with no thought for   
 the future.                           
   Today,much of the derelict land     
 has been reclaimed and is used by     
 farmers as rough grazing for cattle   
 and sheep.The area suprisingly        
 supports a number of small holdings   
 which provide an alternative life     
 style in a marginal farming           
 community.The landscape has blended   
 quite well into the countryside,      
 although there is a marked absence of 
 trees on much of the reclaimed        
 area,which still gives the impression 
 of a rather{sterile}landscape.
