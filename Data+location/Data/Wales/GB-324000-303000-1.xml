		<title>01The Landscape</title>
		<content>    The main features of our area are  
 grassland and forest.Our community is 
 scattered,with farms and houses dotted
 around.It is beautiful and picturesque
 with lovely views of the Severn       
 Valley.The highest point is an old    
 Celtic Fort,Beacon Ring, 1,338 feet   
 above sea level.Welshpool is the      
 nearest market town,famous for its    
 smithfield,which lies NW of Leighton  
 .Powis Castle is prominent on the     
 western edge of Welshpool.Many of us  
 live near Offa's Dyke path and many   
 tourists walk along it.A Roman road   
 crosses our area,and drovers used it  
 regularly in the last century taking  
 cattle to markets in England.The Welsh
 Harp Inn is still there today.        
    We like living in a rural area     
 because it is quieter than living in  
 towns,and life is interesting so close
 to nature in the different seasons.   </content>
