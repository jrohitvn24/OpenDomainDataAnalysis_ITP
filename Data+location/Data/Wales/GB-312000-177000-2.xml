		<title>02Danescourt Housing Estate.</title>
		<content> Before Danescourt Estate was built,   
 the area was farmland. It has been    
 developed over the last 10 years and  
 building is still going on. At the    
 present time there must be over 1000  
 houses, most of which are detached.   
 Our families moved here because we    
 wanted bigger and newer houses. To get
 to work most people use cars buses    
 or trains (which go from Radyr        
 station). There is a primary school   
 withing walking distance and other    
 schools nearby. At the centre of the  
 estate is the church, St. John the    
 Baptist, and a pub, Radyr Court, which
 used to be a farmhouse. There used to 
 be 5 shops but only a newsagents and a
 grocers remain. There is a large field
 provided, to play in, but no parks. At
 weekends we go to town on a bus or on 
 our bikes. There is a regular bus     
 service every half hour.              </content>
