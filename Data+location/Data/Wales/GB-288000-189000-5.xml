		<title>05Depopulation of Pontycymer</title>
		<content>  From 1925 onwards the population     
 decreased, and until the early 1970's 
 many houses in Pontycymer remained    
 derelict. However in the last decade, 
 the population has slightly increased 
 and few houses are now empty. This is 
 because Pontycymer, now becoming      
 devoid of some of the ugliness of     
 industry, is returning to an area of  
 natural beauty and has become         
 residential area. Good communications 
 and especially the building of the M4 
 mean that workers can easily commute  
 to Bridgend Cardiff and other areas.  
  This return of people to an area they
 once were glad to leave is interesting
 . Not long ago few people would have  
 ever dreamed of such an industrial    
 area becoming mainly residential. Land
 values are still low; what happens to 
 them in the future is yet to be seen.
