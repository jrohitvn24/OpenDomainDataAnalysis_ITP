		<content>                                       
 The Stackpole region is a quiet,rural 
 area in South Pembrokeshire.It lies   
 within the Castlemartin Peninsula and 
 is situated roughly five miles from   
 the nearest town of Pembroke.         
         The area comprises the village
 of Stackpole, the hamlet of Stackpole 
 Cheriton and outlying farms. There are
 no shops or public houses in this     
 region and the post office closed down
 in March 1985.                        
         The area is very beautiful and
 is situated in the Pembrokeshire Coast
 National Park. The coastline is       
 exceptionally attractive, and the     
 hilly inland area also has much to    
 commend it.                           
            There are two churches:    
 Stackpole Elidor and St.Petrox and a  
 school of 98 children situated in the 
 village of Stackpole.                 </content>
