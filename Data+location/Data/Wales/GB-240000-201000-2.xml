		<content>  However, these provide only a        
 fraction of the employment needs of   
 the village. Present day mobility has 
 transformed the village into a        
 residential dormitory of Llanelli, but
 Swansea and Carmarthen are also within
 commuting distance. Farming is almost 
 exclusively dependent on milk         
 production, the milk being transported
 to Carmarthen for processing.         
    Village organisations and amenities
 include a Youth Football Team, Wild   
 Fowlers Club, Angling Club, Cubs and  
 Scouts, Brownies and Guides, Gardening
 Club, Over 60's, Darby and Joan,      
 Mothers' Union, Women's Institute and 
 County and Borough Libraries.         
    A large Country Park, including a  
 section of the foreshore, has been    
 developed by Llanelli Borough Council 
 on the south side of the vllage.
