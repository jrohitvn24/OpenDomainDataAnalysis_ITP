		<title>09A Village Buys Its Castle.</title>
		<content> The Norman castle of Dinas Powis      
 stands close to the village.   It was 
 held from the 12th century by the De  
 Sumeri family.   Today the castle     
 consists of a ruined and overgrown    
 keep enclosed by a wall up to 30ft    
 high.   The main gateways are to the  
 south and east.   Legend informs us   
 that the castle was captured by the   
 Welsh, retaken by the English and     
 attacked in the 15th century by Owain 
 Glyndwr.   This was followed by yet   
 another assault by Cromwell in the    
 17th century.   The castle was bought 
 by the local Civic Trust in 1982.     
 The chairman said " We are conserving 
 our heritage and creating an amenity  
 which will balance the spread of      
 modern housing which characterises a  
 dormitory village such as Dinas Powis 
 today.  "                             
                                       </content>
