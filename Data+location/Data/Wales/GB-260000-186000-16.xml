		<title>16Oystermouth - Inshore Rescue</title>
		<content>   To deal with incidents which do not 
 need the service of the big Lifeboat, 
 there is a smaller Inshore Rescue     
 Boat.                                 
                                       
   The first Inshore Rescue Boat was   
 used in 1963. It has a crew of 2 or 3 
 who are also members of the Lifeboat  
 crew. This D Class inflatable boat has
 a speed of 20 knots and can carry     
 between 10 and 12 people. Already this
 year it has been called out 11 times. 
                                       
   The Lifeboat Secretary decides which
 of the two boats is needed to answer  
 an emergency call. One who answers the
 call is Arthur Eynon, whose son James 
 is in J1.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
