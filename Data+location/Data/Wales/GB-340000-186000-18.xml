		<content>  At this point in time Magor is       
 experiencing radical changes,         
 consequently,the villagers opinions on
 how there changes take place is an    
 important factor.                     
  As new estates appear,local people   
 take an interest in how the           
 development can be blended into the   
 existing village,in a manner that     
 does not destroy its character.       
 Therefore the villagers concern for   
 their environment has been heightened 
 ,and has influenced the developers.   
  This co-operation has proved         
 successful.The village centre has been
 deemed an area of historic interest   
 and has a preservation order covering 
 it.New estates have been carefully    
 landscaped,with trees planted to cut  
 down noise and to split up large      
 estates into smaller units.
