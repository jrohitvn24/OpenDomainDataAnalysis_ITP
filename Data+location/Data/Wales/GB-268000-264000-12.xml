		<title>12   TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Public transport is at a minimum.A bus
 service based at Aberystwyth,16 miles 
 away,and called "Crosville" arrives at
 Swyddffynnon 3 times a week,on        
 Mondays,Wednesdays and Fridays at 10  
 a.m..The passengers are taken as far  
 as Aberystwyth,and the bus returns at 
 2.00 p.m..Several people take         
 advantage of this service to do their 
 weekly shopping.Every Tuesday,the     
 Llangeitho bus goes through the       
 village on its way to Tregaron and    
 Lampeter markets every alternate      
 week.It returns at 3.30p.m.A popular  
 means of transport is the "Country    
 Cars",where privately owned cars take 
 passengers to various destinations    
 .This has a distinct advantage over   
 the bus service because it can take   
 people at specific times to their     
 appointments,and return them home     
 immediately.The elderly like this way.</content>
