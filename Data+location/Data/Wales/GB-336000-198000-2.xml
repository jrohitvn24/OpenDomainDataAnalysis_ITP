 Usk was granted its charter in the    
 14 th. century and it was a royal     
 charter. There are only 2{royal       
{charters.}The one is Usk the other one
 is Laugharne, in West Wales. It means 
 that the leader of Usk would be       
 called a{port reave}but it has        
 lapsed and it would cost too much to  
 be reinstated.

 Market St. The town council meets at  
 the{Court House}in Maryport St. and
