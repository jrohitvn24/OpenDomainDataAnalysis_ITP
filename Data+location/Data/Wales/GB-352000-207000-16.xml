		<title>16MY MUM'S DAY</title>
		<content> My name is{Ruth.}We live on a hill-top
 farm. My mum gets up at 6.45, washes  
 and dresses, has a cup of tea and     
 feeds the calves. We have 29 calves.  
 Most calves take a quarter of an hour,
 but one takes half an hour. Then mum  
 prepares breakfast and takes Andrew   
 and me to school. In the village she  
 buys a paper, chats with Mrs. Powell  
 and goes home. She often goes to      
 market in Hereford, Gloucester or Mon-
 mouth to buy in stock. Before a snack 
 lunch she bakes cakes and lights the  
 fires. In the afternoon she does the  
 housework, gardening and fetches us   
 from school.She makes us a drink and  
 we have a chat. Then she feeds the    
 stock and gets tea.Afterwards Mum does
 some sewing, ironing or paperwork.    
 Finally she listens to music, sees us 
 to bed and, later, goes to bed herself
 and reads or does crosswords.         </content>
