 The area that we were assigned to     
deal with is part of Briton Ferry      
which was  in the past a hive of       
industrial activity. Some of this      
history is still evident but           
unfortunately most of the buildings    
have been knocked down.  Our first     
impression of the land was dismay! It  
didnt look a very interesting part to  
look at. On delving further,however,we 
discovered quite a lot of interesting  
aspects.  On the map that we were      
given it shows the site of the old     
Albion steelworks and the Whitford     
sheet works.This has now been          
removed.The land has been generally    
flattned by the West Glamorgan County  
council.
