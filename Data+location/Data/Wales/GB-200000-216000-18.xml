		<content> We all came back to school from the   
 summer holidays.Half of the children  
 were in new classes and I reached the 
 top of the school.It's my final year. 
  Soon we were preparing for Harvest   
 Festival.That morning the school was  
 full of fruit and vegetables ready to 
 go down to the church.We presented our
 gifts to the vicar and he said        
 thankyou and blessed them.            
  Later in the year we were getting    
 ready for Bonfire Night.We made a huge
 bonfire picture on the wall in the    
 entrance hall.Then we made the guy out
 of old clothes stuffed with straw.    
  Soon it was time for Christmas.We all
 had fun getting our plays ready along 
 with the songs and carols.There was a 
 huge Christmas tree in the hall and on
 the day of Christmas lunch all the    
 teachers were in fancy dress.         
  When we came back from our Christmas </content>
