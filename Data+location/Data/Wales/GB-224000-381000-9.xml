		<content> The PENRHOS NATURE RESERVE was created
 after the land was purchased by the   
 Rio Tinto Zinc company to build an    
 aluminium processing plant.The company
 was persuaded by an ex police officer 
 to gift part of the land to the       
 community as areserve and sanctuary   
 for injured wildlife.                 
 There has been a close liaison between
 the reserve and the local schools,with
 many children being part time wardens 
 and guides.                           
 The warden Mr.K.Williams recieved the 
 M.B.E.for his services to the         
 conservation of wildlife.             
 The reserve is open to the public     
 throughout the year,and it is possible
 to ramble through wooded areas that   
 were once part of the Conant family   
 estate.
