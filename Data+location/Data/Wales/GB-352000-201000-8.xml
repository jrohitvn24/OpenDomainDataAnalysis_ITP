		<title>08THE HUDNALLS WOOD</title>
		<content>   The Hudnalls is an area of common   
 land stretching from Coldharbour to   
 Brockweir.No-one actually lives in the
 woods but there are many dwellings    
 nearby.Mr.George Creswick is the      
 Keeper of the Hudnalls.He is 88 and   
 his family have lived on the Common   
 since 1497.He has to make sure that   
 the woods are kept in good order.     
   St.Briavels residents are allowed to
 take animals to graze in the woods and
 to gather wood.In earlier times the   
 people used the wood for their ovens  
 and fires.Today,people are turning to 
 wood as a source of fuel again. Goats 
 are not allowed grazing because they  
 eat the treebark.                     
   Every Whitsunday for more than 170  
 years the Creswick family have thrown 
 bread and cheese to the parishioners  
 after the evening service in recognit-
 ion of the use of the Hudnalls.       </content>
