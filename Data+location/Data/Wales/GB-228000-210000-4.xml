		<title>04HOUSING IN LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> Described in the early 19th Century as
 "one of the best-built little towns in
 Carmarthenshire", Laugharne has about 
 28 Listed Buildings, some with Group  
 Value.  Home Improvement Grants and   
 Conservation Area Grants have enabled 
 repairs and restoration to some of the
 older houses.  A Council House Estate,
 Orchard Park, adjoining the old Town, 
 contains 60 houses, rented at Â£17.50  
 to Â£24.80 p w and a newer Council     
 estate, Frogmore Gardens, built in the
 last decade, rent at Â£19.50 to Â£22.20 
 p w.  There are few garages on either 
 estate or the older part of town.     
 Domestic Rates are Â£1.76 per rateable 
 Â£.  Private house prices average      
 Â£35,000.  Flats for let, holiday      
 homes, a Mobile Home Park and a home- 
 less parents home make up the rest.   
 Eleven new houses built this year, a  
 few also empty.                       </content>
