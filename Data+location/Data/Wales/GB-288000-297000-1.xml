		<content> This area consists of two river       
 valleys the upper Twymyn and          
 Cwmcalch-divided by ridge up to 450m  
 high. It is almost exclusively sheep  
 farming county, run on a family basis.
 All other employment is outside, in   
 Newtown (15m) adjoining forestry and  
 at Laura Ashley factories in  Carno   
 84ms) and Newtown. About 505 of       
 occupied houses are restored cottages 
 used by retired 'immigrants' from     
 England or as holiday homes. This part
 of Llanbrynmair community is very     
 sparsely populated. The valley bottom 
 is cultivated for pasture/sillage, up 
 the slopes the rough pasture merges   
 into moorland, and vast farms run up  
 from the river to give a section of   
 each kind of land.
