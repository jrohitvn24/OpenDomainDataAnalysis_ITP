		<title>11GYFYLCHI MOUNTAIN CENTRE</title>
		<content> Just across the Pelenna River, outside
 the village is the site of a ruined   
 chapel - Gyfylchi Chapel. Using stone 
 from the row of disused colliers'     
 cottages that the chapel served, the  
 Neath Development Partnership - a     
 Neath Borough Council enterprise to   
 develop employment in the Neath area -
 has built a Mountain Centre. It has   
 accomodation for groups who wish to   
 come and use the numerous sports and  
 outdoor pursuits amenities in South   
 West Wales. The centre is very much   
 the product of a local borough        
 councillor called Howell Britton but  
 the actual building was carried out by
 long-term unemployed people from the  
 Neath area, including people from     
 Tonmawr.A great deal of retraining was
 involved ... a young woman learned    
 plastering, for example.
