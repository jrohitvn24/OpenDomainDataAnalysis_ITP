		<title>06Sally Darcy ghost story.</title>
		<content> Once there was a young girl called    
 Sally. She decided to go for a walk   
 across the railway line between       
 Brithdir and Bargoed on the Great     
 Western Railway line that runs from   
 Cardiff to Brecon.She didnt hear the  
 train coming. The train thundered     
 around the bend and Sally was so      
 engroced in picking flowers that she  
 did not hear it. She was knocked over 
 and killed. One of her legs was       
 amputated and somehow it ran up the   
 valley side Sally was found and buried
 but her leg was not found.            
  The story goes that if you visit her 
 grave at midnight on the twelfth day  
 of the twelfth month, and run around  
 her grave twelve times her leg will   
 appear and attempt to kick you.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
