		<content>  In the village around the shop about 
 80 people live.  Only 4 people do not 
 work locally. Some are retired or are 
 unemployed but most work locally on   
 the farms or the Lanarth estate.      
  There are about 28 properties which  
 include 8 council houses and 2 farms. 
  Most people own cars but otherwise   
 there is a bus service to Abergavenny 
 running once a day except weekends.   
  There is a small village church and a
 social club for the village           
 entertainment.                        
                                       
 Post Office                           
 - This has been here since the        
 beginning of the century. Used mainly 
 for the cashing of pensions and       
 allowances, also the puchasing of most
 foodstuffs. The shop has a notice     
 board which is an important source of 
 local information.                    </content>
