		<content>  In such a small area the variety of  
 plants and trees is wide. The main    
 influence on the vegetation seems to  
 be altitude, depth and type of soil   
 and amount of sunlight.               
  {Flowers}                            
  Wild flowers are plentiful and       
 varied. On one day in September about 
 30 varieties were observed in flower. 
 Most common varieties were vetches,   
 yarrow, red dead nettle and heather.  
 In low lying land there are many      
 hedgerow flowers, especially where    
 the ground has been undisturbed.      
 Unfortunately, where the surface soil 
 is damaged by heavy vehicles, nettle, 
 dock and rose bay willow herb tend to 
 take over to the exclusion of other   
 varieties.                            
  The high land has areas of heath     
 plants such as heather, gorse,        
 bilberry and bracken.                 </content>
