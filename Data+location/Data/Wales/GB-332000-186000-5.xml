		<title>05VANDALISM. NEWPORT.</title>
		<content>      Ringland is a large council house
 estate built on the eastern boundary  
 of Newport. Many people live there in 
 a large variety of houses. There are 3
 and 4 bedroomed houses, some detached 
 and some in terraces. There are also  
 maisonettes and flats, some of which  
 are in multi-storey tower blocks.     
      According to a survey, most      
 children think that the estate is     
 vandalised. This takes many forms, all
 of which do nothing to improve the    
 appearance of the area. Paint has been
 sprayed onto walls, windows in bus    
 shelters smashed, telephone boxes     
 damaged. Some supermarkets have       
 replaced glass windows with plywood.  
 People are very worried about this    
 problem, but it is only ordinary      
 people like us who can help prevent   
 it.
