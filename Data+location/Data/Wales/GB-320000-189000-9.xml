		<content>{ Housing in the Crosskeys Area        
 The core housing in the area was built
 when the main shafts of the surround- 
 ing pits were sunk. The first houses  
 were built largely of dressed pennant 
 grit blocks, some with brick pine end-
 ings &amp; windows &amp; door decorations. For
 an example of the age of the main     
 housing, Waunfawr Primary School was  
 built in 1890 and it can be presumed  
 that the rest is the same age. By 1920
 Crosskeys was virtually built, many   
 buildings such as the Workmen's       
 Institute and chapels playing an      
 important part in the lives of the    
 people.                               
 Most of the housing is on the valley  
 floor in rows of terraces. There may  
 have been farms on the floor but these
 have now gone. Small hill farms, many 
 with Welsh long houses, are situated  
 half-way up the mountain slopes.      </content>
