		<content>{CLYRO AND LLOWES SHOW ASSOCIATION}    
 In 1977 Clyro and LLowes Parishes     
 joined to celebrate the Silver Jubilee
 of Queen Elizabeth II. The Association
 has continued since that time.        
 A Show is now held annually, at       
 Boatside, on the fourth Saturday in   
 August. Wintertime events raise money 
 to run the Show, Whist Drives, Jumble 
 Sales, Cheese and Wine Parties and a  
 Car Boot Sale. On Show Days a marquee 
 houses the best from Local Gardens and
 Kitchens, Crafts, Wines and a         
 Children's Section. Outdoors are      
 Sports, Sideshows, Livestock Classes, 
 Children's Ponies and a Dog Show.     
{THE CARNIVAL                          
       A fortnight before the Show a   
 Carnival travels from the Primary     
 School to the Baskerville Arms, where 
 a barbecue and dance complete the     
 evening.                              </content>
