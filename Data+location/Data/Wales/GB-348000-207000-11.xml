		<title>11'GARDEN OPEN TODAY',LYDART</title>
		<content> We open our garden at The Yew Tree to 
 the public at Easter and Whitsun,with 
 entrance contributions going to the   
 National Garden Scheme. Apart from    
 supporting a charity,it is a pleasure 
 to share one's garden with enthusiasts
 both local and from overseas.         
 Our garden is set on a west facing    
 slope; many visitors relax on the     
 seats at the top of the hill to gaze  
 at the marvellous views of the Welsh  
 hills. Far from being exposed on a    
 hillside,the slope itself allows      
 us to escape from severe frosts and   
 protects the garden from wind.        
 Many visitors,having seen plants new  
 to them are keen to acquire some for  
 their own gardens. As many of our     
 plants are unusual,rare or difficult, 
 we have made the decision to start a  
 nursery to supply such plants to      
 visitors and for sale locally.        </content>
