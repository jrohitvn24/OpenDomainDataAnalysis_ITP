		<content>   There are two shops in the village, 
 Park Stores, and Saunders. Mr.        
 Saunders has a warehouse which was    
 used for storing grain and corn which 
 arrived by train. The farmers used to 
 collect it from him. There were a few 
 mills where inhabitants used to grind 
 corn which was grown locally. There   
 was a weir and a malt house which is  
 now a farmhouse. Across the road from 
 the shop is an old cottage which still
 has the original railings around it.  
 Next to Saunders shop is the Post     
 Office run by Mrs. Nichholls.
