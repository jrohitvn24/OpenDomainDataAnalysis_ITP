 centre of Dyfed. It has a population  
 of 14,000,it is 210 miles from London 
 and 9 miles from the sea.Holiday      
 traffic is heavy in summer time.      
 Carmarthen is very old and dates      
 from pre_Roman times.It was occupied  
 by the Romans and later the Normans   
 built a castle. A Franciscan Friary   
 is now being excavated.Market day     
 is Wednesday and cattle marts are     
 held weekly. The town is very busy    
 on these days.Carmarthen has a twin   
 town in Brittany called Lesneven      
 and many exchange visits have been    
 made. The new bridge is named Pont    
 Lesneven.Much road work has been done 
 in recent years to provide new by pass
 facilities for the town.
