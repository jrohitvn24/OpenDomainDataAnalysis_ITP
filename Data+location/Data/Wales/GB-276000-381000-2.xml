 limestone headland, 207 metres above  
 sea level, and is surrounded on three 
 sides by sea.The main features are :  
{cliffs, limestone grassland,          
{heathland, limestone pavement and     
{farming. }These different habitats    
 give us 350 species of wild plants.   
{The Great Orme Country Park and Nature
{Reserve}(area 3sq.km.) was set up in  
 1980, under the care of Mr.John Davies
 (Warden), to maintain and preserve the
 rich variety of natural life on The   
 Orme.                                 
 The Orme has become a recreational    
 attraction having a footpath, road,   
 tramway and cable car to the summit.  
 The summit has a cafe and hotel,a shop
 and a bar, and is visited annually by 
 half a million people.The cliffs are  
 popular with climbers and hang-glider 
 enthusiasts.                          </content>
