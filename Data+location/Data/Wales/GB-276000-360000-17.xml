		<content> The parish church of St. Grwst lies at
 the end of a narrow lane leading out  
 of Ancaster Square. Built in 147O, it 
 has more recent additions. Nearby is  
 the Gwydir Chapel built by Sir Richard
 Wynn, housing relics of his family,   
 the sarcophagus of Howell Coetmor 15OO
 and the empty stone coffin of         
 Llewellyn the Great. The chapel is    
 always open to visitors. On either    
 side of the street are almshouses     
 built by Sir John Wynn, in which a    
 museum may be started. Inigo Jones    
 designed the Bont Fawr (Big Bridge)   
 across the Conwy which today is the   
 cause of many delays.                 
 Tu Hwnt i'r Bont (beyond the bridge)  
 is of 17th century origin used then as
 a court house. Seriously damaged by   
 flood water, it became derelict. It   
 was restored by the National Trust and
 is now a tea room in the summer season</content>
