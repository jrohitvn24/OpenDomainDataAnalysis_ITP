		<content>   Many homes have labour saving       
machines.  these machines help save the
work in the house such as decorating   
and dish-washing.  They also save work 
in the garden. We made a list of 16    
 hat we have in our homes.             
   There are many different foods to   
buy and cook in 1985.  In Tredegar we  
have 3 supermarkets, 2 hypermarkets, 6 
cornershops, takeaways-indian snd      
chinese and hotels for food and drink. 
We cook food on either gas, electric or
microwave cookers.                     
   There are more parents working than 
unemployed.  More families are buying  
houses than renting them.  Most of us  
save in building society or banks.     
Many of us have pocket money of about 1
to 5 pounds.                           
   Most children in our class have     
pets. some have more than one.  Alot of
people buy pet food.                   </content>
