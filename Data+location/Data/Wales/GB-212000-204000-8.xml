		<content> October 17th,1984.                    
 It was a Sunday morning at 7.45a.m.   
 Everything was quiet until there was a
 big explosion. I thought it was       
 Pendine guns practising so I didnt    
 think anything of it.I got dressed    
 ready for church. When we got there   
 Mr. Davies told my dad about the gas  
 explosion, and he said that the local 
 V.G. store had just blown up into     
 smoke and there was rubble all over   
 the place.When we came back from      
 church we tried to go down the village
 to see all of the mess, but when we   
 got there the policeman sent us back  
 through Coppet Hall and past the      
 church. Now they say that the Cambrian
 Hotel may fall down and if it doesnt  
 they will have to demolish it.All of  
 this gas explosion will cost          
 Â£1,000,000.
