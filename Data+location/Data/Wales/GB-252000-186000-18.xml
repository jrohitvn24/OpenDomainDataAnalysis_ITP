		<title>18TYPES OF FARMS IN PENNARD.</title>
		<content>     THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF FARM IN   
 OUR AREA. THERE ARE ARABLE, DAIRY AND 
 BEEF CATTLE FARMING. MOST FARMS ARE   
 ARABLE AND BEEF CATTLE, THERE ARE ONE 
 OR TWO THAT JUST HAVE ARABLE, THEN THE
 REMAINING FEW ARE DAIRY FARMERS. MOST 
 FARMS IN OUR AREA, ARE OVER A HUNDRED 
 YEARS OLD.                            
    NOT MANY FARMS HAVE THE SAME NUMBER
 OF ACRES AS EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT     
 DEPENDS ON THE VARIOUS TYPES OF SOIL  
 AND THEIR PRODUCE.                    
     MOST OF THE NEW FARMERS IN OUR    
 AREA WHO ARE ARABLE FARMERS, FIND THAT
 AFTER THE FIRST YEAR IT BECOMES       
 EASIER TO FARM BECAUSE THEY GET TO    
 KNOW THE FARM LAND. IN A DUAL PURPOSE 
 e.g.CROPS AND ANIMALS MOST OF THE LAND
 IS USED FOR CROPS AND SILAGE, THE REST
 IS USED FOR GRAZING OR PLEASURE.      
                                       
                                       </content>
