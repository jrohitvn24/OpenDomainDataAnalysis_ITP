		<content>Communications in the Abergavenny area 
are quite good.Main roads lead to      
Hereford,Brecon,Pontypool,Raglan and   
the Heads of the Valleys road links us 
to the West.We conducted a traffic     
count and found that on Monday at      
2.30pm Brecon Rd was the busiest.The   
carparks in the town are free.The post 
office carpark is the largest.The      
market area is not used on Tuesdays and
Fridays when the stalls are set up.The 
railway line goes to Hereford to the   
north and through to Cardiff in the    
south.It is possible to reach London,  
Birmingham,Swansea by changing trains. 
There are only 8 trains a day.Buses run
more often but are expensive.You can   
reach Brecon,Cwmbran,Hereford and more 
distant places. Market day buses serve 
the villages and National Express picks
up passengers.Most families have access
to a car.                              </content>
