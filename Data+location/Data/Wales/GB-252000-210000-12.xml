		<title>12Recreation-Leisure Centre.</title>
		<content> The Leisure Centre was opened in  1915
 to serve the community as a Public    
 Hall and Library. It was also a cinema
 until 1982, when it was converted into
 a building for entertainment,         
 recreation and indoor games. The      
 library is still there and it is well 
 attended on Tuesday and Friday nights 
 when it is open.                      
   The Centre is now used by a         
 flourishing and enthusiastic Badminton
 Club, and also by a Karate Club. The  
 multi-purpose building also acts as a 
 Theatre for Drama productions,        
 Concerts and Pantomimes regularly     
 throughout the year. Every third      
 Saturday in September the local       
 Eisteddfod is held there and it has a 
 strong local following.               
   One of the rooms in the Centre is   
 used as a Council Chamber by the      
 Llannon Community Council.            </content>
