		<content> P.C. ROBERTS OUR LOCAL POLICEMAN CAME 
 TO OUR SCHOOL AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS. 
 THE FIRST TIME HE CAME HE WAS         
 DRESSED IN JEANS AND TRACK SUIT TOP.ON
 THE NEXT VISIT HE WAS DRESSED IN HIS  
 UNIFORM AND HELMET WHICH HE LET SOME  
 OF US TRY ON.THIS TIME A SERGEANT CAME
 TOO.HE HAD THREE STRIPES ON HIS ARM.HE
 REMEMBERED GARETH WHO HAD BEEN CHEEKY 
 TO HIM OVER AT THE SHOPS.WE FOUND IT  
 VERY INTERESTING TALKING TO P.C.      
 ROBERTS,HE WAS FRIENDLY AND WE FELT WE
 WOULD BE LESS SHY ABOUT GOING AND     
 TALKING TO HIM IN THE FUTURE.WE WERE  
 SURPRISED THAT HE WAS JUST LIKE ANY   
 OTHER GROWN UP PERSON.HE CARRIED A TWO
 WAY RADIO IN HIS POCKET AND BY IT HE  
 KEPT IN TOUCH WITH THE POLICE         
 STATION,WE LEARNED THAT POLICEMEN     
 CHASING SOMEONE CAN DRIVE THROUGH RED 
 LIGHTS,AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT CAUSE   
 ACCIDENTS OR INJURY.                  </content>
