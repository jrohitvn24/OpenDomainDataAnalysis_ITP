		<title>09CATTLE &amp; CROPS</title>
		<content>{Cattle}raising is also very important 
 in the{Grosmont}area but not every    
 farm nowadays keeps a milking herd.   
 Most of the cattle are reared for beef
 but a large number are sold as calves.
 These are mainly{Herefords}or{Hereford
{Charolais Crosses}which are very good 
 for beef. One of our farms rears bulls
 to sell. The milk that is produced in 
 this area is mainly sold to{Cadburys  
 for making into dairy milk chocolate. 
 Growing cereals and other crops is    
 not so important as it was in the     
{Middle Ages,}because conditions are   
 more suitable for livestock.In the    
 valley of the{River Monnow,}however,  
 where the land is flatter and less    
 than 100m above sea level,wheat and   
 barley are the most popular crops.    
 Very few potatoes or root crops are   
 grown.
