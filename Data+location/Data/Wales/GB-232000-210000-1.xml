		<title>01LLANSTEFFAN AND LLANYBRI</title>
		<content> Llansteffan and Llanybri occupy the   
 peninsula between the estuaries of the
 Tywi and Taf rivers in the south-west 
 of the old county of Carmarthenshire, 
 now incorporated in Dyfed. Its highest
 point is 130 metres above sea level.  
 This is entirely farming country, with
 no other significant industry. Tourism
 in a small way also contributes to the
 local economy. The villages are 8 to  
 10 miles from the county and market   
 town of Carmarthen. 750 adults are    
 listed on the Electoral Register.     
 Pilgrims in past centuries crossed the
 Tywi by ferry from Ferryside to       
 Llansteffan, went on over the         
 peninsula, and crossed the Taf to     
 Laugharne, on their way to St David's.
 This is our first appearance in a     
 Domesday survey. King William the     
 Conqueror's writ did not run here in  
 1086.                                 </content>
