		<content>  Bulldog is running between two walls 
 without being caught.Each time you    
 touch one of the walls you can shout  
 "Barley!".This means that you are in a
 safe place where you cannot be caught.
 You must run regularly between the two
 walls.                                
  Murder in the Dark is for at least 5 
 players.Pieces of paper are given out.
 One piece has a blue dot and another  
 piece has a red dot;the rest are      
 blank.The person who has the blue dot 
 shows the others.He/she is the police-
 man and must leave the room.The light 
 is switched off.The person with the   
 red dot then "murders" someone by     
 touching them.This person fall to the 
 floor.The policeman is the let in and 
 he has to guess by looking at the     
 faces of the players who has committed
 the "murder".If he guesses right he   
 has won the game.                     </content>
