		<title>12A Farm Survey.</title>
		<content> We soon discovered that the land      
 within our block is used almost       
 entirely for agricultural purposes.It 
 therefore followed that one of our    
 initial projects had to be closely    
 connected with farming.Our surveying  
 of the land use led us into contact   
 with many of the farmers of the       
 region,and they were very helpful in  
 explaining the aims of their          
 particular farms.We found that most of
 the farms were surprisingly similar in
 character.The average size of the     
 farms is about 80 to 100 acres.They   
 were of the intensive grassland       
 variety,with the exception of one or  
 two large acreage establishments.The  
 largest farm of the area,with 850     
 acres is Lane Farm belonging to       
 Mr.Trevor Trevor.We interviewed       
 Mr.Trevor about his ideas on farming  
 and his aims and hopes for the future </content>
