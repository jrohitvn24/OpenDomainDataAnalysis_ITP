		<title>05A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>                                       
 A normal day in my life starts at     
 7.3Oam.  I get dressed go down stairs 
 and have my breakfast.  At about a    
 quarter past eight I get my paper bag 
 and start delivering the newspapers to
 houses.                               
  After my paper_round I play with my  
 friend called Martin.  About ten      
 o'clock we catch the bus over to      
 Fishguard to go tthe Saturday Cinema  
 Club.                                 
  When I come back home I have my      
 lunch.  Then usually I play on my     
 bike.  Later I come in and play with  
 my brother Anthony on his Atari.  An  
 Atari is a computer game which you can
 put cartridges in to play games.      
  After my tea I watch television and  
 go to bed at about 8 o'clock.
