  DURING 1985 WE WATCHED THE BUILDING  
 OF SOME HOMES FOR THE DISABLED BEING  
 BUILT AT FAIRWATER CLOSE.WE FOLLOWED  
 THEIR PROGRESS FROM THE FOUNDATION    
 TO THE FINISHED DWELLINGS.ON OUR      
 VISITS WE WATCHED THE MEN AND MACHINES
 DOING LOTS OF DIFFERENT JOBS. LIKE    
 BRICK LAYING AND PUTTING SLATES ON    
 THE ROOF.WE SPOKE TO THE ARCHITECTS   
 FROM CWMBRAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION  
 ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING FOR  
 DISABLED PEOPLE .THERE ARE RAMPS FOR  
 WHEELCHAIRS AND KITCHENS THAT ARE EASY
 TO USE IF YOU ARE IN A WHEELCHAIR.THE 
 SITE WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE IT WAS NEAR   
 FAIRWATER SHOPS A LOCAL COMMUNITY     
 CENTRE AND A CHURCH.SOME OF THE HOMES 
 WILL BE FOR ABLE BODIED PEOPLE SO THAT
 THEY CAN HELP THEIR DISABLED          
 NEIGHBOURS IF THEY ARE NEEDED.        </content>
