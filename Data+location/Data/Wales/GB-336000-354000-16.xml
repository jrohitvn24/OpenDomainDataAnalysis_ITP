		<title>16MARFORD  PAST &amp; PRESENT</title>
		<content> Although only a small part of Marford 
 is included in our GRID we thought it 
 would be valuable to mention why the  
 village was built in the first place. 
 "It was built for a purpose_to house  
 the estate workers and tenants of the 
 local'Halls'.Each member of the       
 village was a craftsman/professional  
 man;the gardener,the inn or shopkeeper
 the smith or doctor.However the       
 functional Marford no longer exists.It
 is now a dormitary village where      
 businessmen ,teachers and pensioners  
 reside.                               
 ...the Marford houses show ingenuity  
 and skill both in their architecture  
 and distribution far above the        
 intelligence of an average craftsman.
