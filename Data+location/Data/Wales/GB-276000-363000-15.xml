		<content>  There are 2 North/South roads, one on
 each side of the River Conwy, and     
 between them is a single-line railway.
 6 trains run daily in winter, 9 in    
 summer,except Sunday. It connects with
 the narrow-gauge steam Ffestiniog     
 railway ending at Porthmadog, and is  
 popular with tourists.                
  A footbridge crosses the Conwy River 
 in the adjacent block, but there is no
 vehicular bridge other than those at  
 Llanrwst and Tal y Cafn.              
  The bus through Trefriw runs hourly  
 between Llanrwst and Llandudno ending 
 too early at night for villagers to   
 enjoy coastal entertainments.         
 Maenan has a single bus from Colwyn   
 Bay to Llanrwst on Market and Fairday 
 and one to Liverpool and Chester on   
 Thursdays and Saturdays.A summer only 
 service goes to Porthmadog,Beddgelert,
 and Llanberis.                        </content>
