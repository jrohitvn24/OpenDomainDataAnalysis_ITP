		<title>09New Hedges Community Hall</title>
		<content> The new village Hall at New Hedges,has
 been completed in time for the social 
 season of activities.A new roof and   
 attractively refurbished stone work   
 has given the former village school a 
 new look.                             
 Already a new number of fund_raising  
 events have been staged in the        
 hall.The community council meets      
 there; so does the Woman's Institute. 
 It is an ideal centre for social      
 functions and local organisers are    
 already taking note of it's           
 attractions and the convenience of the
 setting.                              
 A committee was set up and registered 
 as a charity and the site leased from 
 the church authorities.Community      
 Council members were pleased to hear  
 that the Village Hall is proving a    
 popular meeting place for a variety of
 activities.                           </content>
