		<content>  I got up at half past nine and went  
 to put the kettle on. Then I went back
 upstairs, got dressed, and made the   
 beds then we all went down to the     
 village. I bought a packet of rolos   
 for the children, and a packet of     
 cigarettes. We went back home and I   
 hoovered upstairs and tidied up.Then I
 made dinner which was sausage, beans  
 and potatoes.After that I made welsh  
 cakes and addressed some envelopes for
 the Labour Party at the same time.    
 Then I made tea. When we had eaten it 
 I knitted and watched television for a
 while. Then the visitors arrived and  
 they carried on addressing envelopes  
 so I made them a cup of tea. When they
 had finished doing that I made them   
 some supper and we talk for a while.  
 At half past two they went home and I 
 went to bed.    (29/6/85  M.E.Mellors.
