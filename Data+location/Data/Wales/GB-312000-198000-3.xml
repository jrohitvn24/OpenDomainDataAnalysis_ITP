 NEIGHBOURS FLEE DANGER LORRY          
 The people living in Bridge Street,   
 Bargoed, and the occupants of the  Old
 Mill pub had to leave the street and  
 pub when a lorry carrying 5 kinds of  
 chemicals skidded on Aberbargoed hill 
 on Monday evening. The police said the
 chemicals would have been  dangerous  
 if split open and mixed. The lorry was
 towed away safely after an hour and a 
 half.                                 
 DRUGS DEALER JAILED.                  
 Police watched a man, aged 29,        
 of Greefield Street, Bargoed taking a 
 package from a stone wall on Gelligaer
 Mountain. They followed his car and   
 later saw him weighing a brownish     
 substance which was found to be drugs,
 valued at Â£1600. He was sentenced     
 to 18 months in jail.
