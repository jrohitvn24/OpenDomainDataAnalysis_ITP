		<title>12Bilingualism &amp; Heol-y-Cyw.</title>
		<content>  The policy of bilingual road signs   
 has caused much discussion in this    
 village. Most people believe that     
 towns etc. should be known by their   
 Welsh names but admit that bilingual  
 signs would be advantageous for those 
 visiting, especially when the places  
 are commonly known by their English   
 names. However where places have      
 always been known by their Welsh name 
 they see no need for bilingual signs. 
{Who would recognise Fairfield as the  
{town always known as Maesteg? }       
  Corruption of many words has changed 
 the original meaning of many place    
 names. The literal translation of     
 place names are,in some cases,        
 offensive to the inhabitants.         
  Heol-y-Cyw is one such place and     
 efforts are being made to trace the   
 origin of the name.
