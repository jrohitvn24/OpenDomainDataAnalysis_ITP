		<content>{Aston}on Deeside in Clwyd is typical  
 of many areas in Wales. A large       
 housing program after the war provided
 council homes for families, but as    
 children grew up parents were left    
 living in a valuable family home.     
                                       
 A survey conducted by the local       
 authority showed sheltered housing for
 older residents would be accepted.    
 These homes have been built in several
 phases on land owned by Clwyd County  
 Council.                              
    There are now over 90 homes and a  
 community centre.Community amenities  
 provied for the older &amp; newer housing 
 include a library ,council run        
 nursery, social services community    
 centre, home for the mentally         
 handicapped, Greencroft and our school
 St. Ethelwold's Church In Wales       
 Primary School.                       </content>
