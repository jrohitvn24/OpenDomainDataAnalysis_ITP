		<content> Farmers buy and sell their sheep in   
 Welshpool in the market on Mondays.   
                                       
 Every year about June the sheep are   
 sheared after they are dipped in a    
 large bath.                           
                                       
 Sometimes sheep get ill so the farmer 
 takes them to the vet, who gives them 
 medicine.  They could drench them     
 themselves.  Sometimes they get       
 maggots in their heads, because they  
 fight with other sheep.  They get     
 bloated too because they eat string.  
 They have to have a hole in the       
 stomach so that all the air can get   
 out.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
