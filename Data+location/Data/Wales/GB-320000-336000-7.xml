		<title>07GLYN CEIRIOG SLATE MINE.</title>
		<content> The Chwarel Wynne slate mine and      
 museum is in Glyn Ceiriog and its     
 ownership can be traced to the 1750's 
 when it was in the possession of      
 Edward Wynne. Mining continued in a   
 nearby quarry until the winter of 1946
 when part of the mine was flooded.    
  The building that is used today as   
 a museum,once housed steam driven     
 winding machinery.Various trucks and  
 tools used above and below ground are 
 on display. Visitors can walk down the
 mine with a guide and see full sized  
 models of men at work. The trip under 
 ground lasts 20 _ 30mins. Back above  
 ground there are other attractions    
 e.g.nature walk, a video commentary on
 slate quarrying, a shop,an aviary and 
 a small restaurant.
