		<title>14SHOPPING IN USK</title>
		<content>  We did a survey of the use of the    
 shops in{Usk.}Most people interviewed 
 were locals and very few had travelled
 further than five miles.We found that 
 most people did a{main shop}each week 
 with about a of quarter of the people 
 going monthly.                        
 Half of the people went shopping      
 every three days for{fresh food.}Three
 quarters of the remainder went        
 every day and the rest once a week.   
    Everybody had a{fridge}for keeping 
 food fresh and most had a{freezer.    
 About{one fifth}had a{microwave       
 which is becoming more popular,       
 especially for cooking frozen meals   
 quickly .Very handy for families when 
 both parents work. While Usk was      
 popular for{food and stationery,}very 
 few shopped here for{clothes,furniture
{and electrical goods.
