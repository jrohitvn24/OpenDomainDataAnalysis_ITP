		<content>{Over and Under the Moon}is a skipping 
 game. Two children turn a rope and the
 other children run under it. When they
 reach the other side they turn, run   
 back and jump over it. They carry on  
 in this way until someone trips or    
 gets caught in the rope. This person  
 then takes a turn on the rope.        
{Sheep Sheep}is a group game with one  
 person on it. The child who is on it  
 stands in the middle of the play-     
 ground and the rest of the children go
 to one end of the playground. These   
 children try to run to the other end  
 without being caught by the one who is
 on it.If you are caught you help to   
 catch the other children. Once there  
 are three catchers they stand against 
 the wall at the start to make it      
 easier for the others to run across.  
 When all are caught a new game starts 
 with the first one caught as catcher. </content>
