		<content> The Majestic Jazz Band,was formed in  
 1980.  There are 38 members in the    
 band.  The colours of our uniforms are
 light blue, navy and white.  The      
 instruments of the band are{3 maces,  
{4 belaires, 1 tambourine, 1 cymbal,   
{25 gazzoos, 2 bass drums and 2 side   
{drums.}The fund raising committee work
 very hard raising money.  They have   
 jumble sales, sponsored walks, sell   
 raffle and tote tickets.  This year we
 have bought our own bus.  We need     
 transport because we travel to a      
 number of carnivals and we enter many 
 competitions. We train once a week for
 three hours.  If we have a competition
 coming up we will then have two       
 practices in the week.  On the 25th   
 May,1985, we were in the{World Jazz   
{Band elimination competition}at       
 Aberavon.  In our division we came    
 third.                                </content>
