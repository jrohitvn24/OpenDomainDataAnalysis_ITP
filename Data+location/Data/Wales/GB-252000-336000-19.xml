		<title>19SUPERNATURAL IN MORFA BYCHAN</title>
		<content> The strangest event recorded in the   
 area occurred at Christmas,1693,when  
 'unearthly fires rose from the sandy  
 bog',moved across the sea to the      
 Harlech area,set fire to haystacks and
 killed many farm animals.It was 'a    
 kind of hot mist with a small blue    
 flame'and did not affect humans.It    
 happened only at night and usually on 
 Saturdays and Sundays.Loud noises from
 horns,drums and guns were found to    
 disperse the fires.Witchcraft was     
 suspected and a man arrested,but he   
 escaped while being taken to a        
 magistrate.Pennant,the historian,     
 thought the fires were caused by the  
 drowned bodies of a flight of locusts.
