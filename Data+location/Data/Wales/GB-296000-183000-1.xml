		<title>01BRYNNAU-GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> Brynna is situated within the Taff Ely
 District.A small rural village approx 
{6\}miles West of Bridgend.Brynna is a 
 small settlement with the public house
 ,the church and some shops serving the
 needs of the farming community.It is  
 bordered by the rivers Ciwi and       
 Ewenny.With the discovery of coal in  
 the village many emnigrants ,seeking  
 work came from different areas        
 e.g.Forest Of Dean with the result    
 that the welsh language has never been
 nurtured or encouraged until this     
 century.The village began to develop  
 eventually linking with the next      
 village of Llanharan.New council      
 housing was built after the{2nd World 
{War.}Due to it's attractive situation 
 private housing soon came into        
 existence.The village today is more of
 a satellite to the towns either side, 
 Llanharan and Pencoed.Cont.Pg.19      </content>
