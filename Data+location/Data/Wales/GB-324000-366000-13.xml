 10 days ago she has collected Â£150.   
 "It is amazing how exceptionally kind 
 people are. There are so many         
 different appeals around at the       
 moment, but most people have  been    
 only too willing to give something",  
 she said.The appeal has no target but 
 the equipment she wishes to buy costs 
 around Â£3000 including a cardiac      
 monitor. Everton Football club has    
 given a signed autograph book which   
 will be auctioned by a Radio City D.J.
 and Highfield Riding Club are holding 
 a one day event on Sunday with part of
 the proceeds going to the fund raising
 appeal.Northop Playgroup is holding a 
 bring and buy sale on June 28th and   
 will donate its profits."I would like 
 to go back to the hospital with a fat 
 cheque" said Mrs Wakley.
