 From the top deck of the bus I saw Ty 
 Gwyn Old Peoples Home, Fairwater      
 Lesiure Centre/Comprehensive School   
 and then saw Springvale Industrial    
 Estate farther down the hill. We came 
 to Thornhill which was all red brick  
 including shops,school and even the   
 Kingfisher Pub. There I noticed a post
 box. The Yew Tree area stop was       
 where the most people got on the      
 bus. Soon after that we reached the   
 town centre. There were some odd      
 flats there. We spotted Peterson's    
 Funeral Home, the Fire Station and    
 lots more things. The journey took one
 hour. Our route was Coed Eva_Fairwater
 Greenmeadow-Thornhill-Upper Cwmbran   
 Pontnewydd-Town Centre and back.
