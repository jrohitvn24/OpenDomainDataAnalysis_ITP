		<title>18LANDSCAPE OF LLANBISTER</title>
		<content>     Llanbister nestles in the gentle  
 folds of the hills. Below, the Ithon  
 meanders through a patchwork of fields
 and laid hedges.The majority of fields
 being under 10 acres, with large areas
 of riverside pasture. Scattered small 
 oak woods and alder grow on the valley
 sides. Common land of gorse and       
 bracken border the farms. The houses, 
 constructed from local stone under    
 slate roofs, sometimes brick framed,  
 are in harmony with the natural       
 contours of the land. Farm buildings  
 are stone, brick and part timberframed
 and boarded. One cruk framed longhouse
 is still lived in.                    
    The 13th cent.Parish Church built  
 of stone under slate has fine timber  
 work in the roof and a music gallery  
 of 1716.The tower is at the east end. 
 Llananno Church has a very fine 16th. 
 cent. rood screen.                    </content>
