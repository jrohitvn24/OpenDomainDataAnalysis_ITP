		<title>11         LANGUAGE</title>
		<content>  Most of the residents of the         
 Llanferres &amp; Loggerheads area speak   
 English even though they have the     
 ability to speak Welsh.Few have the   
 ability to speak an overseas          
 language,with the exception of one or 
 two who spoke Latin and German.       
  The majority had an English          
 education,while at the same time      
 learning such languages as            
 Latin,French and German.Intrest in    
 Adult Language courses was low.       
  Very few residents were English      
 immigrants-the majority were Welsh.   
 The few immigrants saw no point in    
 learning Welsh,as they saw no         
 practical use in doing so.
