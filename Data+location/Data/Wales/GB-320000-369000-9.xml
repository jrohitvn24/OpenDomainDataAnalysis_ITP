		<content> My father, who is a teacher of        
 history, tells me that when he was    
 young he was always reading a book. He
 certainly reads a lot today! My mum   
 also reads a lot, so I have been      
 brought up to read and enjoy books,   
 but a lot of my friends hardly ever   
 seem to read. I decided to find out   
 just how many children of my age read 
 books:                                
                                       
    100% have read at least one book   
     14% are always reading a book     
     21% regularly read books          
         (more than one a month)       
     46% read books occasionally       
         (between 3-12 books a year)   
     19% hardly ever read books        
         (less than 2-3 books a year)  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
