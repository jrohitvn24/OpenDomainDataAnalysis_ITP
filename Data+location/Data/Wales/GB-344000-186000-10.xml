		<title>10Green Lane Junior School</title>
		<content> Our school is thirty years old. It    
 opened on April 1st 1955.             
    The building is mainly of wood with
 very large windows and  a flat roof.  
 The grounds are open plan. We have a  
 playground and a large grass area     
 for sports facilities.                
    Today there are 176 children       
 between the ages of seven and eleven  
 and seven staff including our         
 headmaster. There is a secretary, two 
 cleaning staff, six kitchen staff and 
 three meals supervisors.              
    Children learning to play musical  
 instruments are taught by visiting    
 teachers. In the evening our school is
 used by Caldicot Male Choir, the      
 Severn Tunnel Band and the Gwent      
 Carousel 'Jazz Band'.
