		<title>03THE CASTLE</title>
		<content> The castle was built in 1092 and was  
 last inhabited in 1450. It had a moat 
 around it filled by water from the    
 stream at Llangenny Lane. The water   
 then run from the castle moat to the  
 River Usk. As the castle fell into    
 ruins the local people used the stones
 for their houses and all the          
 house-fronts in the main street were  
 built with these stones.              
 40 years ago children could enter the 
{dungeons}which are situated under the 
{"tump"}from an entry at the bottom of 
 the square tower. This has since been 
 filled in to prevent any accidents.   
 The "tump",which is the local name for
 the raised portion of the castle, is  
 now overgrown with weeds and if nobody
 cares for the castle soon it may well 
 disappear. It was given to the town by
 a man in memory of his son who was    
 killed in the First World War.        </content>
