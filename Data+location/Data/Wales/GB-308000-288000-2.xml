   My mum wakes me up at about half    
 past seven and I have{breakfast.It's  
 usually cereal,sometimes  tea and     
 toast.At eight my friend Sarah comes  
 to call for me and we go to school.   
   After the register we go into       
 assembly where we listen to a story   
 and sing hymns.We also listen to      
 music.I liked it when we heard Do they
 know it's Christmas.In the morning we 
 do maths which I don't like much.But I
 like maths programs on the{computer.  
   In the afternoon we have            
 English,Topic and P.E.At{playtimes we 
 play deno or tick.I finish school at  
 3.45 and when I get home I rush to    
 change and go out to play.After tea   
 I watch telly and have to go to bed   
 about 9.30.But at weekends I can stay 
 up and watch horror films.            </content>
