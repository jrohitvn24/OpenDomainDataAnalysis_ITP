		<content> My name is Wayne Richards.I am 10     
 years old.We get up soon after 7a.m., 
 and have breakfast.My dad has to be at
 his work on a nearby farm at 8o'clock.
 He drives a tractor and looks after   
 the cattle and sheep.My brother and I 
 go to school on the bus.We have to    
 work at our lessons.My mother and     
 little brother stay at home.My mother 
 does the housework.She washes the     
 clothes and irons them.She cleans the 
 house and hoovers the carpets.She     
 sometimes takes my little brother to  
 the playgroup where he learns to play 
 with other children.We come home at 4 
 o'clock and my mum makes the tea while
 we do homework and then watch T.V.My  
 dad comes home for his tea,and then he
 has a sleep after his tiring work.    
 After that he has a bath and watches  
 T.V.
