		<content>   There are eleven places of worship  
 in the grid area. 28.3% of the        
 children in Brookfield School attend a
 Sunday School at one of these places. 
   St. Gabriel's Sunday School starts  
 at 11.00 a.m. every Sunday. There are 
 30 children and we read books and make
 pictures.                             
   The Salvation Army holds services   
 every day and we sing hymns and the   
 band plays. There are seven classes in
 the Sunday School and they are always 
 well attended.                        
   David Periam does not go to Sunday  
 Schoolbecause he likes to lie in bed  
 on Sunday mornings, and by the time he
 gets up and has his breakfast, Sunday 
 School is finished.
