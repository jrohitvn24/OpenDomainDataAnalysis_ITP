 P.C.Pinnington has been a policeman   
 for 15 years. He wanted to join the   
 force so he could help other          
 people.He used to be a constable then 
 was given promotion to be a sergeant. 
 He went on picket duty during the     
 miners' strike. He enjoys his work a  
 lot.He has made many arrests and was  
 once run over by a man who had just   
 stolen a car. He works shift work and 
 each shift is eight hours long.He     
 wears a blue uniform and a heavy blue 
 helmet and carries a truncheon and a  
 purse for his handcuffs. He tried out 
 his handcuffs on Kirstin. He does not 
 carry a gun.Sometimes he drives a     
 police car.His wife was a police      
 woman for 6 years. We know him        
 because he was Jane's neighbour.
