		<content> One hundred people put their          
 activities in the following order of  
 importance - T.V., Sport, Reading,    
 Walking, Gardening and Dancing (76%   
 put T.V. first. Sport is mainly       
 concentrated at Heolddu Sports Centre,
 opened in 1974. Facilities include    
 Badminton, Squash, a fitness room,    
 Swimming, Tennis and an all-weather   
 surface. Many courses are organised   
 here - swimming, keep-fit and squash  
 are most popular. Close by, the       
 18-hole golf course extends northwards
 overlooking the Darren Valley. The    
 main park is pleasant and has a       
 running track (used by the Rhymney    
 Valley Athletic Club) and playing     
 fields. The area supports an annual   
 half-marathon which passes through the
 main street. There's a rugby club, a  
 library, a nightclub and a dancehall.
