		<content>  {Moelfre Isaf}(317 metres) is a      
 prominent landmark in the area. This  
 hilltop was used as a site for one of 
 the chain of beacon fires which were  
 lit across the country to celebrate   
 the wedding of H.R.H. the Prince of   
 Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. 
 A number of hills and mountains in    
 North Wales were used for this        
 celebration on the evening of the     
 wedding, including Moel Famau to the  
 east and Snowdon to the west.         
   There is a triangulation point      
 situated at the summit of Moelfre     
 Isaf, used for determining the height 
 above sea-level of various landmarks. 
   A small amount of quarrying has been
 carried out here in the past, but the 
 land is now used for grazing sheep.
