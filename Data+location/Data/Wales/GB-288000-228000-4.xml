		<content> Rural Wales. (1976) the hill farmers' 
 diet probably consisted of potatoes,  
 oatmeal, bacon, butter and cheese.    
 Some idea of what a farm in Trecastle 
 had can be evaluated from the Auction 
 in October 1870 of Carllwyn farm.  For
 sale were 5 cows in calf,3 heifers in 
 calf, 3 yearlings in calf (all        
 Herefords), one steer, 65 ewes, 25    
 wethers, 2o lambs, 2 carthorses and 2 
 pigs.  implements included a gambo, a 
 plough, a harrow, a roller, dairying  
 and brewing implements, 2 mows of     
 oats, 3 mows of barley, 2 mows of     
 wheat and 4 ricks of hay.  (A mow was 
 a stack).                             
 Camden House had a commanding view of 
 the High Street.                      
 The Post Office is situated on the    
 opposite side of the road to the      
 Blackhorse Inn.  The High Street goes 
 down into a valley.                   </content>
