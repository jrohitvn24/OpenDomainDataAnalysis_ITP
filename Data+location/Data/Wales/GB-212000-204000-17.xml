		<content>{A day in my life   by Bryan White}    
 I woke at about 7.15.a.m. and got     
 dressed.I was so excited as it was my 
 birthday.I went into mum's room and   
 asked if I could open my presents. She
 took a box from under her bed.I opened
 it and the card said it was from Mum, 
 Dad,Katy,Sarah and Steven.Inside was a
 camera with a film.Then Dad came up   
 with the tea and another present.It   
 was from Aunty Jane,Uncle Jim, Emily  
 and Tom.It was a jigsaw.I went down   
 stairs for a breakfast of cornflakes, 
 toast and jam.After breakfast I went  
 for the papers carrying a present for 
 Nanna.When I went there she said that 
 it was mine.I opened it and there was 
 a camera case and a film I went back  
 home and got ready for school.When I  
 got there about 9.10 I played soft    
 ball until 9.30.and then got down to  
 work in class.                        </content>
