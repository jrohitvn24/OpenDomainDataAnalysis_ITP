		<content> In April 1985 an Over Fifty Five      
 Club was started in the village of    
 Bodfari.The members meet once a       
 fortnight in the Recreation Room which
 is opposite Bodfari School.The club   
 was set up so that the fifty five     
 year olds and over could meet and     
 participate in various activities.    
 There are thirty five members,the     
 oldest being eighty five years old.   
          The many activities include  
 whist drives,bingo,guest speakers and 
 day trips to various locations.The    
 village school children have been     
 invited to entertain.Part of          
 the money from the school's sponsored 
 walk is donated to the senior         
 citizens.
