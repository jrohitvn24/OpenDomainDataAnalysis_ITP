		<title>20Llandudno Development.</title>
		<content>{  A SHOPPING ARCADE}is proposed on the
 site of the Town Hall (retaining the  
 facade) and adjacent land. Two develop
 -ers have expressed  interest in the  
 scheme, publicised as a high class    
 development of small, exclusive shops,
 one advocate stating that it would    
 make Llandudno the{'Bond Street' of N.
{Wales.}Plans submitted so far have met
 with mixed feelings and the proposed  
 development is very much in the early 
 stages.                               
  The town has been linked with the    
 story of{Alice in Wonderland}(seeLocal
 History) and it is proposed to develop
 a{Theme Park}on Bodafon Fields (not   
 within this grid, but the whole town  
 would be affected). Those wishing to  
 retain the unspoilt eastern approach, 
 and the Chamber of Trade, are against;
 others feel that more should be done  
 to provide amenities for tourists.    </content>
