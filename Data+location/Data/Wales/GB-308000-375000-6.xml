   The A55 is the busiest road in      
 North Wales, passing in an East to    
 West  direction across the Southern   
 quarter of the block, which is at     
 present a single carriageway. On the  
 Western side of the block there is a  
 steep hill called "Rhuallt Hill",     
 which has become a notorious "accident
 blackspot. However the finance has now
 become available for its re-routing   
 and subsequent improvement to dual    
 carriageway status which will         
 eventually form part of the expressway
 which is intended to run from Chester 
 to the Isle of Anglesey. All other    
 roads in the block are minor and in   
 some cases rarely used single track   
 lanes.
