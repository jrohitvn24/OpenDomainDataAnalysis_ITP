		<content>{Chester Chronicle 29/3/85:}Fire       
 engines,ambulances and police cars    
 raced to{Deeside High School}last week
 equipped for a major disaster.The     
 school fire alarms had sounded and    
 police received telephone calls about 
 a suspicious character in the school  
 grounds having been seen shortly      
 before a bomb exploded in the boiler  
 house.The students were being tested  
 on weeks of theory put in for the     
 community studies lessons.The disaster
 was all a carefully planned hoax.Weeks
 of meticulous planning and liasing    
 with the area's emergency services had
 culminated in this realistic          
 operation. My dad Mike Nichol works at
 the ambulance station. His time-table 
 is 07.30 to 19.30hrs on days for 4    
 days and 1930 to 0730hrs on nights for
 a week.My dad  likes it and he wants  
 to work as long as he can.NICOLA SHONE</content>
