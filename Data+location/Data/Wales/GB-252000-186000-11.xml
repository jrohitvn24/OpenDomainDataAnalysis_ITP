		<title>11THE FLORA OF PENNARD.</title>
		<content> MOST OF THE FLOWERS  IN OUR SCHOOL    
 GROUNDS ARE DAISIES AND DANDELIONS .WE
 FOUND A LOT OF OTHER FLOWERS IN THE   
 HEDGEROW. WE FOUND CHUMPREY, WILD     
 ROSE, YARROW, DOG DAISY, SHEEP'S      
 SORREL FOOLS PARSLEY, HARESFOOT CLOVER
 AND NETTLES. AROUND PENNARD THERE ARE 
 LOTS OF WILD FLOWERS. WHEN WE WENT FOR
 A WALK ON THE CLIFF WE PICKED QUITE A 
 LOT OF FLOWERS AND PLANTS. WE FOUND   
 SOME HERB ROBERT WHEN WE WERE WALKING 
 ON THE CLIFF. WE SAW SOME HONEYSUCKLE,
 CLOVER AND GIANT BINDWEED. ON THE WAY 
 BACK WE SAW SOME LUPINS AND SPEEDWELL.
 THE FLOWERS WE FOUND ON THE CLIFFS DID
 NOT HAVE VERY LONG STEMS. WE FOUND    
 MOST OF THE FLOWERS IN SANDY SOIL. ON 
 THE CLIFFS THERE WERE NO TREES BUT    
 THERE WERE LOTS OF GORSE BUSHES,      
 BRAMBLES AND ELDER BUSHES. THEY ALL   
 GREW VERY LOW TO THE GROUND.
