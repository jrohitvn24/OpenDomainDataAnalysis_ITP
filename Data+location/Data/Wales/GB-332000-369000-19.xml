		<title>19Old Sealand Remembered.</title>
		<content> An old gentleman came to our school to
 tell us what Sealand was like when he 
 was a boy of 10. He is now 72. He told
 us that many of the houses like the   
 Broseley Estate and Riverside Park    
 council estate had not been           
 built.There were really only 2 main   
 streets, Sealand Avenue and Farm Road.
 All the other council houses and      
 Garden City were built much later.    
 There was no by-pass and Welsh Road   
 was the main road, but that had only a
 few cars but quite a few horses and   
 carts. The gentleman's name was Mr.   
 Garner.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
