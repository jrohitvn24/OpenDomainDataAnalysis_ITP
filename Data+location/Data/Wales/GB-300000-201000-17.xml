		<content>{THE ABERAMAN PUBLIC HALL.             
  Two buildings dominate the survey    
 area: St. Elvan's Church and Aberaman 
 Public Hall. The foundations of the   
 present building were laid in 1907    
 although the facility began in old    
 colliery buildings supported by       
 contributions paid by the colliers.The
 original building contained a reading 
 room,library,theatre and swimming     
 pool.In recent years the building has 
 fallen into a state of disrepair.The  
 theatre which was also used as a      
 cinema and a Bingo hall has been      
 closed.                               
  However,there is new hope for the    
 building as the theatre is now being  
 refurbished for live theatre and      
 cinema.There are no cinemas in the    
 area at present.There are also hopes  
 that the rest of the building will    
 become a community centre.            </content>
