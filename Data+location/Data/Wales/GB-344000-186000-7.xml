		<title>07Dewstow House</title>
		<content> "Dewstow" means "St David on the      
 Hill". It is supposed to be the site  
 of one of the earliest churches       
 dedicated to St David but there are no
 records to support this. There is,    
 however, a mass grave with bones      
 dating back to between the 10th and   
 13th centuries.                       
    In 1880 Dewstow House was bought   
 by a wealthy London Barrister, Mr     
 Henry Oakley, who built the oriental  
 gardens and underground grotto. Before
 the First World War 15 gardeners were 
 employed and the gardens were open to 
 the public about 4 times a year.      
    After Oakley's death in 1940 the   
 gardens became neglected.             
    The House is now lived in by the   
 family of a local businessman.
