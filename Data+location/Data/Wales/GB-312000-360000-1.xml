		<content> Our study area is situated in the Vale
 of Clwyd in North Wales. It is a wide 
 valley bordered to the west by the    
 Hiraethog Mountains and to the east by
 the Clwydian Hills.The area extends   
 from the River Clwyd on the floor of  
 the valley almost to the highest point
 of the Hills on the easern side.      
    It is a rural area with many farms 
 and small villages. A large section is
 moorland which rises to a height of   
 over 1800 feet.The village of Gellifor
 is the focal point where most of the  
 people live. The only other village is
 the hamlet called Hirwaun.            
    The area is crossed by narrow      
 country lanes, only a few of which are
 suitable for heavy transport. Gellifor
 lies about three miles north west of  
 Ruthin and six miles south west of    
 Denbigh.
