		<content> Those attending the chapel have       
 dropped from 39 in 1974 to 23         
 presently.Half of those are regular to
 the afternoon service in Welsh.5      
 deacons choose who will preach each   
 week as there is no minister.The most 
 important service being Easter Service
 when all attend.Present secretary     
 Mr.M.Davies preaches occasionally and 
 was the last to be baptised.Baptism is
 in the Lliedi river and is performed  
 by a minister.In 1982 a ceremony to   
 celebrate 150yrs of the chapel took   
 place and was attended by many other  
 chapels from Llanelli.In 1983,1200    
 pounds was raised to repair the facade
 and part of the roof.There is another 
 chapel in the area with a similar     
 congregation.Once a month a church    
 service is held in the school hall.   
 There are indications that church     
 attendance in the area is in decline. </content>
