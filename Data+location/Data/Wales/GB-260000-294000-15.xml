		<title>15TREFRIFAWR FARM ABERDYFI</title>
		<content>    Located on the steep mountainside  
 overlooking the northern shore of the 
 Dyfi estuary{Trefrifawr Farm}is a     
 typical Welsh hill farm.              
    The farm buildings are a mixture of
 old and new,the oldest dating from    
 1738.The farm itself consists of      
 permanent pasture,rough grazing and   
 woodland.Hay grown on the flatter     
 fields is the only crop on this       
 livestock farm.                       
    A flock of Welsh mountain ewes     
 crossed with a Suffolk ram produce    
 approximately 300 lambs per year,a    
 small herd of Welsh Blacks provide    
 calves for sale at 12/14 months and   
 two breeding sows produce 2 litters   
 per year.                             
    A farm trail at 80p/adult is a     
 recent innovation.It remains to be    
 seen how far the present tourist boom 
 will influence what is a working farm </content>
