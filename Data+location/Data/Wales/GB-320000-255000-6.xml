		<title>06PLACE NAMES AROUND GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> In English, the name of our village is
 Gladestry. No one is sure of the      
 meaning of the name. In Welsh the name
 of the village is 'Llanfair Llwyth    
 Yfnwg'. But only one or two people    
 speak Welsh in our village now.       
 On the map of our area there are      
 thirty eight names. There are twenty  
 Welsh names and eighteen names are    
 English. A Welsh name usually means   
 that the place is older than if it has
 an English name. An example is        
 'Gwern-dyfn-nant', which means 'The   
 Alder marsh by the deep brook'. Some  
 of the hills have Welsh names and some
 have English names. 'Cefnhir' is a    
 Welsh name. It means 'Long Ridge'.    
 Burl and Yew Tree Bank are examples of
 English names. A lot of the Welsh     
 names are mixed-up because people do  
 not understand them.
