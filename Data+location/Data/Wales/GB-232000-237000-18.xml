		<content> Prior to reorganisation in 1974,I was 
 a member of the Newcastle Emlyn Rural 
 District Council with its offices     
 situated at Pontwelly, Llandysul.     
 Members represented areas of Penboyr, 
 Llangeler,Newcastle Emlyn,Llanybyther,
 Llanfihangel-Rhosycorn,Llancrwys,     
 Cenarth and Llanfihangel ar Arth-the  
 river Teifi forming a boundary between
 our Council and Ceredigion. Our       
 Council had a great sense of Welshness
 and was proud of the great work       
 achieved  by its Housing and          
 Environmental Committee.In 1970 I had 
 the honour to be its Chairman. In 1974
 reorganisation took place and we were 
 amalgamated with the Carmarthen       
 District Council with its spacious    
 Headquarters at Carmarthen.This       
 Council now embraces both farming and 
 industrial areas.In 1979 I was made an
 Honorary Alderman.{MRS.M.B.WILLIAMS.  </content>
