		<title>13A SCHOOL DAY IN GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> On a school day we get up at 7.50am.  
 We have wheatflakes and toast for     
 breakfast. We feed our gerbil, clean  
 our teeth and make our beds. We go    
 down to school in the car. Before     
 school we play games or chess. School 
 starts with assembly, except Friday   
 when we go swimming at Knighton. Then 
 we do maths until playtime. After play
 we do English or some sort of writing 
 until 12 o'clock. Then we have dinner 
 in school. After dinner we have 40    
 minutes play. In the afternoon we do  
 history, geography, games, art, or    
 sometimes we go for walks or have a   
 special visitor. We go home at 3.20pm.
 We go home in the car, but sometimes  
 we walk across the fields. We play    
 until suppertime. Most children watch 
 a lot of television, but we do not. We
 go to bed about 8pm. Mum reads to us.
