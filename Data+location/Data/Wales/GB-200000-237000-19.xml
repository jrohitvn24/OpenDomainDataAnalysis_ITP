		<title>19Why Do People Live In Dinas</title>
		<content>{LIKES                                 
      We went round Dinas with         
 questionnaires and asked various      
 people questions about Dinas.We have  
 made a list of things which the people
 like about the village.The most       
 popular things are that it is         
 peaceful,close to the sea and the     
 friendly people that live here.

{DISLIKES                              
         When we went round Dinas with 
 the questionnaires we also asked them 
 the things they dislike about the     
 village.The most things that the      
 people living are especially unhappy  
 about are the heavy traffic on the    
 main Cardigan to Fishguard road;the   
 fact that there are no pavements in   
 parts of the village;and the lack of  
 facilities for young people.
