 Kilvey Hill is situated on the East   
 side of the city of Swansea and on the
 Southern end of the Swansea Valley.   
 Kilvey Hill rises steeply from the    
 docks area of Swansea bay and reaches 
{a height of 193 metres.} The River    
 Tawe and its valley run along the     
 western and northern sides of Kilvey  
 Hill.                                 
{The greater part of the area we       
{surveyed consisted of rough hillside  
 covered with a mixture of coarse      
 grass, heather and conifers planted by
 the Forestry Commission.  There is one
 farm, Carn-Nicholas which concentrates
 on improving the pasture for grazing. 
 At the top of Kilvey Hill there is a  
 large area for receiving and boosting 
 television signals.                   </content>
