		<title>14Cowbridge Cattle Market</title>
		<content>  We visited Cowbridge Market on 14th  
 May 1985.                             
  Cowbridge market is open every       
 Tuesday. Farmers come to buy, sell and
 look at animals. Some come locally and
 others come from further away. There  
 were about 60 people there. The type  
 of animals bought were sheep, calves, 
 cows and piglets. The breeds of cattle
 were Friesions and Hereford Reds. A   
 farmer told us that a fat lamb would  
 cost Â£50, a dairy cow would cost Â£450,
 a Jersey cow would cost Â£250, a bore  
 Â£30 and a sow Â£90. Unbought animals   
 are slaughtered.                      
  John Morgan is one of five           
 auctioneers. He pays with the other   
 four auctioneers to keep the 100 year 
 old cattle market in good condition.  
 John Morgan has been auctioneering for
 over ten years. He only handles       
 livestock.                            </content>
