		<content> The Gravestone of local heroine Jemima
 Nicholas is at St Mary's Church,      
 Fishguard.  She died at her home in   
 Main Street in July 1832.             
  She marched to meet the French       
 Invaders who landed on our shores in  
 February 1797.  At the date of the    
 Invasion she was 47 years old.  She   
 told all the women of Fishguard about 
 the Invasion, and she thought up a    
 plan.  It was if the ladies would put 
 on red shawls and black hats they     
 would look like red coats.            
  When the French saw them marching    
 they thought they were redcoats.      
  The French surrendered and signed a  
 peace treaty in the Royal Oak in      
 Fishguard.  The table they signed the 
 peace treaty on is still in the Royal 
 Oak.
