     Bodyshock                         
 In Bodyshock our breakdance crew there
 are fifteen members.They have special 
 names,such as Wizard,Lastic Legs,and  
 Voyager.                              
  On June 2nd. we had an uprock. An    
 uprock is competition between two rock
 crews.                                
  There  are special moves in          
 Breakdancing.Rock Stead flips are when
 a strong person locks his hands       
 together and flips you backwards into 
 a somersault and you land on your     
 feet.Backflips are gymnastic moves.   
   All breakers dance to music. There  
 are special types of music,such as    
 Rap,which is a speeded up version of  
 Reggae                                
  Clothes that breakers wear are       
 usually Nike or Puma tracksuits and   
 special training shoes.               </content>
