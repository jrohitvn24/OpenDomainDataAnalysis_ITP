		<content> On 24th, 25th and 26th of March 1985  
 Ferryside was in the news. Three men  
 had been left stranded on the         
 sandbanks out in the estuary and      
 rescue services had to be called out  
 for assistance.  A girl aged 10 was a 
 witness to what happened.             
     On Sunday March 24th Rebecca      
 Pearson and I were playing on the     
 beach when suddenly my older sister   
 rushed on to the beach and shouted    
 "Hey dad's been called out on duty."I 
 wondered what was going on.I looked up
 and there was a yellow helicopter     
 hovering around.Then I saw my dad     
 going past in the rescue boat.There   
 were four people who had been on a    
 walk to {Scott's Bay}in Llanstephan   
 and they had got trapped by the       
 tide. (continued on page 11.)
