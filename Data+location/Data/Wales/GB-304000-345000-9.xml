		<content>{Farming}is the major industry. There  
 are a few dairy farms, from which the 
 milk is taken to a creamery in the    
 vale of Clwyd for cheese making.      
{Sheep}rearing is ideal for this area, 
 the popular breeds are Border         
 Leicester, Welsh Half Breds, Suffolk  
 and Kerry Crosses and the Pure Welsh. 
{Stock}rearing is undertaken, Hereford 
 &amp; Continental breeds are the main but 
 Welsh Blacks and Friesians are reared.
 There are very good livestock markets 
 within a radius of 25 miles for all   
 animals.                              
 The climate is not advantages for     
 cereal growing but some farmers do    
 grow them mainly for their own use.   
 Hay is harvested on most farms but    
 silage especially the Big Bale is     
 catching on. The majority of farms are
 owner/occupied and are family run.
