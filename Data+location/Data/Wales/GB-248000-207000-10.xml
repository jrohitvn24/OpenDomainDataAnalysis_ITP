		<title>10Language in rural Dyfed.</title>
		<content> English is the main language in this  
 area which everyone knows and         
 understands.                          
 Many older people in this area speak  
 welsh but it is not pure welsh which  
 is spoken but mainly pidgin.The       
 standard of welsh is improving as     
 children are being taught properly in 
 Ysgolion Meithrin (Nursery Schools),  
 primary schools and bilingual         
 comprehensives.                       
 People have come to realise that      
 instead of welsh being a dying        
 language it is emerging as a language 
 of the future.Official forms are now  
 bilingual and so are church services  
 and road signs.
