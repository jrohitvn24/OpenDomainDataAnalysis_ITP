		<title>17RELIGION IN WISTON</title>
		<content> In Wiston there is a Church of Wales  
 called St.Mary's.It is a norman church
 with a tower.For a small village the  
 attendance is good,with a congregation
 of about 40 every week.The vicar,has  
 just left to go to St.Mary's +        
 St.Thomas church in Haverfordwest.Our 
 new vicar has not been inducted yet.  
  Our church is grouped with           
 Spittal,Treffgarne,and Ambleston and  
 we all share the same vicar,wholives  
 in Wiston in the Vicarage next to the 
 church.The organist in church also    
 keeps the Post Office and Village     
 shop.Church services are at 9.00a.m on
 Sundays.Just outside Wiston is South  
 Dairy Baptist Chapel,there are 25     
 members.There is a Sunday School which
 we go to and there are 12             
 members.Every year we have a trip to  
 Tenby.At the chapel I play the piano.
