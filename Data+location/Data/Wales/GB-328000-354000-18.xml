		<title>18Attitudes, Abermorddu Pupils</title>
		<content> A school {survey}covering 160 pupils  
 from the ages of 5 to 11, shows that  
 only 49 pupils regularly attend       
 church. This is 30%. Only 5 (3%) went 
 occasionally, whilst 106 pupils (66%) 
 never attended.                       
 Questioned as to why they did not     
 attend, most pupils spoke of other    
 attractions ({television, trips}) as  
 the main reason for not going. The    
 attitude of some was that church was  
 boring and that as their parents did  
 not go they shouldn't have to.        
  It appears from the survey that even 
 fewer parents attend regularly.       
  Those who went to Sunday School      
 regularly did so from enjoyment or    
 because their parents want them to go.
  It seems that it is in {Primary      
{School}tyhat most pupils receive any  
 form of religious education.
