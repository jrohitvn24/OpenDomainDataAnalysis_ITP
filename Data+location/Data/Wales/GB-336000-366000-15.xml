 whole D-Block, the majority in the    
 densely populated suburb of Blacon.   
 Another chiefly residential area lies 
 around Stonebridge and Whipcord Lane. 
   Both residental area's community    
 lives are based around the local      
 schools, churches and meeting halls.  
 They offer various activities such as 
 playgroups,scouts and bingo. Locally  
 it is felt that more youth clubs are  
 needed.There are several Entertainment
 Dancing Troupes, which many families  
 are involved with.                    
   Regular bus services allow residents
 to use Chester's amenities. Many also 
 live within walking distance.         
   Local residents work together to    
 provide extra amenities and events:   
 eg A Community House in Stratford Rd.
