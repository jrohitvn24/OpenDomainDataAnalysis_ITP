		<title>07A SCHOOL DAY IN BASSALEG</title>
		<content>We are in the middle infants class of  
Bassaleg C.V.Primary School.Every day  
we walk to school and play with our    
friends.When the bell goes we line up  
for assembly.We have a story and say   
our prayers and sing,then each class   
goes to work.We read and learn to write
neatly and we like doing stories.We    
like to count and measure and learn our
times tables.In the afternoon we do    
things like sewing,plasticine,bingo,   
drawing,building with blocks and we    
read books.We learnt about Red Indians,
and our teacher told us about Joseph in
the Bible.We do P.E.on Monday,and we   
have singing on Monday and Friday.Some 
of us have school dinner,and some of us
bring sandwiches.Before we go home we  
usually have a story.
