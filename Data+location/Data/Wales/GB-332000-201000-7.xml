		<content> When the village shop closed it was   
 missed particularly by the elderly and
 those who had no private transport.   
 Since,mobile traders have provided    
 some services.As well as daily milk   
 delivery the milkman sells eggs,cream,
 juices,newspapers and magazines.      
 Three times weekly the baker calls. A 
 grocer delivers orders and a butcher  
 visits specified sites weekly.Coal is 
 delivered fortnightly and a hardware  
 van sells paraffin,detergents and     
 other household items.                
 Refuse collections are weekly from our
 gateways.                             
 A very reliable window cleaner calls  
 once a fortnight, weather permitting.A
 baby clinc and a chiropody service for
 senior citizens are run monthly by the
 Health Authority.                     
 The mobile library van visits each    
 week.                                 </content>
