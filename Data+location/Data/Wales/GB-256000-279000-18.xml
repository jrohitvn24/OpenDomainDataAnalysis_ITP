		<content> A survey was made of houses in two    
 square Kms. covering the most densely 
 populated part of Aberystwyth.        
    In square Km. 02580281 the number  
 of houses was {1161}.Many houses have 
 been converted into flats,the number  
 being{286}.We conclude that this high 
 number accounts for the fact that     
 Aberystwyth has a large number of     
 students requiring accommodation.     
 Housing is required for students who  
 attend the University,College of      
 Librarianship,College of Agriculture, 
 Theological College and College of    
 Further Education.                    
     In square Km. 02590281 the number 
 of houses was only{392}and the amount 
 of flats was{20}.We conclude that     
 these numbers are smaller because most
 of the area is taken up by the        
 University campus,the National Library
 ,Bronglais Hospital and a sec. school.</content>
