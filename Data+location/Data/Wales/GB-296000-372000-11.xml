		<content> In the 1970's a pipeline was put down 
 to carry oil from the Amlwch Off Shore
 terminal to Stanlow in Cheshire.  This
 is known as the Shell U.K. pipeline.  
 A section of it has been put          
 underground in the area.  The path is 
 marked at intervals by white          
 standpipes and this enables the path  
 to be traced from the air.  It crosses
 the land in a west to east direction  
 and all farmers have been compensated 
 for the use of their land.  The area  
 is also crossed by electricity pylons.
  There are two types.  One type       
 carries very high voltage electricity 
 for the National Grid from power      
 stations like Wylfa and               
 Trawsfynnydd.Smaller pylons carry     
 lower voltage power to supply local   
 properties.  The pylons take up       
 considerable land and land owners have
 again been compensated.               </content>
