 Pontlottyn had terraced houses with   
 coal fires for heating,gas or paraffin
 lighting and a cold water supply.     
 Because of the coal strikes of the    
 twenties local business men went      
 bankrupt.There was 30% unemployment at
 this time.The low pay of the collier  
 was Â£2 and 6d a week.His boy assistant
 got 2/6 a week.People walked          
 everywhere.There was a good railway   
 system but it was too expensive.It    
 brought in supplies to Pontlottyn,    
 Rhymney and Fochriw.The horse drawn   
 brake was the cheapest transport.There
 were three schools in Pontlottyn.The  
 Infants',The Girls' School and the    
 Boys' School.Slates and chalk were    
 used.The local pits were Tynewydd,    
 Dyffryn and Maerdy.Some women worked  
 on top pit.
