		<title>02Llanilid Church</title>
		<content>{Llanilid Church}is said to be the     
 oldest church in Britain. When in     
 Llanilid we noticed a large stone     
 block in the churchyard. Behind it    
 were fields. We found out that coffins
 were carried through the fields and   
 were placed on the stone block so that
 the bearers could have a rest.        
    A tradition talks of a great visit 
 to{Caractacus}at Llanilid by none     
 other than{St.Paul.}They had earlier  
 met in Rome, about AD 58-59 when they 
 were prisoners. Llanilid Church is    
 very ancient but still looks and is a 
 very nice church. When I visited the  
 church we could see what was left of  
 the motte. It had a circumference of  
 about 140 paces. We thought that the  
 stone from the motte might have been  
 used for the church. A tree in the    
 churchyard is said to have sprouted   
 seven other trees of different kinds. </content>
