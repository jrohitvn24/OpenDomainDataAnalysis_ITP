		<content> Aberaeron is the largest settlement   
 in the area(The Domesday Block).The   
 estimated population in 1976 was      
 1500. The 1981 census showed only 1444
 people.                               
 In 1981 there was a{significantly     
{larger number of females than males,  
 and there were almost twice as many   
 women as men over the age of 60.      
 The small number of males in the      
 20-60 age group probably{reflects the 
{lack of job opportunities locally.}   
 In comparison with the rest of        
 Ceredigion it had a lower proportion  
 of people in the 15-44 age groups and 
 more retired people.{17.7%}of the     
 population are under 16 but{25%}are   
 over 65.This reflects the national    
 trend of an ageing population.        
{Providing services for our old people 
{is a growing problem. Keeping young   
{people in the area is also difficult. </content>
