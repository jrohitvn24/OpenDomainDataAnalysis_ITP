		<content>{An account written by Louise Wilcox of
{Bryngwn School.                       
 On Saturday morning at 9.30am my alarm
 clock went off,I got up and went to   
 the bathroom to wash and dress.Then   
 I went down stairs and sat with my    
 baby sister.I got up and turned the   
 television on.My mam was in the       
 kitchen making a cup of tea,so I went 
 in and brought my tea and the baby's  
 bottle.When it was 10.00am my dad came
 down and turned the tele. over to     
 "Captain Caveman" and the news.I went 
 up stairs to play on my Atari.After I 
 took the baby out in the pram.At 11.00
 we went to our friends from Gloucester
 who had come on a visit.We showed them
 around our house and in the afternoon 
 we went to Llangynidr Reservoir.When  
 we came home we watched "The Grumble  
 Weeds"and "Dynasty".
