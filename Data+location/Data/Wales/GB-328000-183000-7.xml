		<content> On June 5th we went to{Newport Docks}.
 When we got there, a lady called Tracy
 showed us around.  First we went to   
 the lock.  The one side of the lock,  
 the water was 47 feet but the lock    
 water was 50 feet.  Then we went to   
 the sheds where they kept the cargo   
 from the ships.  We went to see the   
 cars, these included Mitsubushi,      
 Subaru and Lonsdale.  They came from  
 Japan.  On the way to see the cars, we
 saw a ship carrying bananas from      
 Jamaica.  We also saw two tug boats.  
 The docks also handle citrus fruits   
 from Israel.  The coal in the docks is
 sent to France and Spain.  The timber 
 is softwood from Canada and hardwood  
 from Malaysia.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
