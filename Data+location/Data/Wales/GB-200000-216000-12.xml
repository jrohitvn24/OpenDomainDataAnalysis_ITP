		<title>12HOUSING-BY IAN AND DANIEL.</title>
		<content> There are three main types of housing 
 in Wiston,council house,new private   
 bungalows and old two storey          
 houses.Most of the older buildings are
 in the heart of the village close to  
 the church and the castle,most of them
 are stone built.The new bungalows are 
 spread out along the roadside leading 
 from the junction to Clarbeston Road  
 and Llawhaden.Most of these have been 
 built in the last twenty years and are
 rendered with some facing stone for   
 decoration.Wiston stands on high      
 ground and if taller houses were built
 they would as high as the sky line and
 they would be seen from miles around. 
  The only housing estate is the       
 council houses and that is very small
