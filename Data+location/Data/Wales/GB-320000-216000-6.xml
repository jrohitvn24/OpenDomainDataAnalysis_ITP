		<title>06A MORNING AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I arrive at school at{8.40 a.m.}to    
 play cricket before school starts.    
 I put my bag in the classroom and then
 go out to play. I am fourth batsman.  
 At{9.20 a.m.}the whistle goes and we  
 all shout "'s lines". I have never    
 lined up to go into class but we still
 shout it from the days when the       
 children used to do so. At{9.30 a.m.  
 we go across the yard to the hall     
 where we all assemble for{prayers.}We 
 sing two hymns and say a lot of       
 prayers. Then it is time to return to 
 our class for lessons, first of all   
{Maths}then{Welsh}then it is           
{11 a.m.}and playtime.I eat my crisps  
 and apple.After it is time for        
{English.}At{12.20 p.m.}we finish for  
 dinner. I have sandwiches but some    
 have school dinner and a few go home. 
 Most stay in school because we have a 
 long time for playing then.           </content>
