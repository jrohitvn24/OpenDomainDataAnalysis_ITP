		<title>20Language in the Area.</title>
		<content> Most of the people in the area speak  
 English but there are still many      
 people who speak in the Welsh         
 Language.                             
 There is a fear that the Welsh        
 Language is in the process of dying   
 out but it is to be hoped that this is
 not to be the case.It is true that    
 many of the people locally who speak  
 Welsh are old and that most of the    
 major influences are English.But there
 are signs that the Welsh Language is  
 fighting back.Welsh is taught in      
 schools,there are many Adult Welsh    
 Courses,there is a channel on the     
 television for Welsh,people can send  
 their children to Welsh schools to be 
 taught through the medium of Welsh and
 there is a youth organization called  
 the Urdd which sends children to a    
 centre in West Wales to have a holiday
 in a Welsh environment.               </content>
