		<content> Penarth is a small coastal town. It   
 was built mostly for its docks which  
 were used, like Cardiff 5 miles away, 
 to export coal. Now the docks are     
 closed and Penarth has become a       
 residential town.{Llandough Hospital  
 covering about 7 acres of land, is not
 only used as a hospital, but is also  
 used as a training hospital and as an 
 old peoples' home. The{Town Hall} is  
 in the centre of the town, and this   
 year the Town Mayor is{Dr.Sibert}who  
 works at Llandough Hospital. The      
{Lifeboat Station}is on the Esplanade. 
 Further along the coast there is a    
{Coastguard Lookout Station.}On the    
 seafront there is a{Pier}which is used
 for fishing, and pleasure boats like  
 the Waverly call there to pick up     
 passengers in the summertime. Just off
 the coast there are two islands,{Flat 
{Holm and Steep Holm.}                 </content>
