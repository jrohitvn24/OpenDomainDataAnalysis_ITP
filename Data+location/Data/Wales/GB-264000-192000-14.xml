{The leisure centre was opened in 1977 
{as part of the foreshore development. 
 It became popular very quickly because
 of the wide range of activities it    
 provided.  There is something for     
 everyone to do, from tennis, squash   
 and bowling to weightlifting, swimming
 and diving. The swimming pool even has
 a wave machine.                       
 In March 1985 after a long debate, the
 council decided to put a{hydroslide}in
 the swimming pool. It is like a       
 gigantic covered chute.  The idea came
 from a leisure centre in West Germany.
 The hydroslide is very popular,       
 especially with children. {It cost    
{Â£100,000 to build}and there was a lot 
 of fuss when the council decided to   
 spend all that money on one item, but 
 now the expense is forgotten.         </content>
