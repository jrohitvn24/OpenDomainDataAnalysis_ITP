		<content> On Friday an ordinary day in school   
 begins like this. I come to school at 
 about 8.50am and then I go in to class
 to get my chair out. Then we all      
 have assembly, after assembly we go in
 to our classes and have the dreaded   
 spelling test and then we have play   
 which lasts for quarter of an hour.   
 Then we do Maths until dinner time    
 break which lasts for one hour. After 
 dinner break we go over the park where
 the girls play rounders and the boys  
 play cricket. When we come back its   
 usually break time but some times we  
 are late in the afternoon we have a   
 quiz boys against girls and that goes 
 on for half an hour and then we go    
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
