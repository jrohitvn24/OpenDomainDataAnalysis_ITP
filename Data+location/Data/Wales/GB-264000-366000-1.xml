		<content> The area is predominantly rough       
 grazing for thousands of sheep and a  
 few dozen ponies and feral goats.     
 Several farms have sheep ranges in the
 area, which is typicallly high pasture
 except for the valley of Afon Caseg   
 running east-west along the southern  
 boundary of the area.  The peaty      
 valley floor, though grazed, has      
 coarser vegetation.  The valley mouth 
 has some high enclosed fields.  The   
 ridges and slopes are well drained and
 dry whereas the flatter cols and cwms 
 in between are wetter and peaty.  Most
 of the area is owned by the National  
 Trust.  A complex of sheep pens       
 occupies the south slope of Gyrn      
 647688.  The users of the land are    
 exclusively Welsh speaking.  A few    
 illdefined footpaths cross the area   
 but in the higher reaches (Bera Bach, 
 Yr Aryg) they are marked at intervals </content>
