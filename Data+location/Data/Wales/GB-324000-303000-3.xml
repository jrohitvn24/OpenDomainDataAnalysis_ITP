		<content>{   This splendid farm of John         
 Naylor's was considered one of the    
 most modern of its time.When we       
 visited it recently we could still see
 the ruins or remains of the modern    
 engineering as in 1851.Water was      
 dammed and channelled to drive a      
 turbine at the farm.This powered      
 machines in the mill,and sheep        
 shearing implements.We saw the        
 water-pipes,the round piggeries,the   
 rail tracks which carried trucks      
 of fodder into the sheds.Even the     
 huge barn doors worked on a pulley    
 system. Gas was provided for the      
 Hall and the Church by the gasworks   
       Up on Moel-y-Mab,600ft. above   
 river level we can still see a great  
 tank where liquid manure was made.    
 There is a funicular railway bridge   
 which is in a serious state of        
 dis-repair.                           </content>
