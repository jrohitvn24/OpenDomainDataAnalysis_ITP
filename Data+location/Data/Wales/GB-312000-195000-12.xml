 As a whole there are 26% of people who
 have lived in the village for over 50 
 years,23% in the 21 to 50 age group   
 and 11% in the 0 to 5 year age group. 
 Almost without exception the people   
 who have moved into the village have  
 come from the surrounding area,within 
 a 15 mile radius.                     
        The new estate has the highest 
 proportion of children,particulary the
 under 4 age group,and no-one over the 
 age of 60,whereas the other areas have
 a more even spread between the age    
 groups.                               
        The first 5 rows of houses were
 built for miners families.Later,people
 were allocated council accomodation or
 moved into the area for employment.   
 There is some movement out of the     
 village usually due to a change of    
 council house or job.                 </content>
