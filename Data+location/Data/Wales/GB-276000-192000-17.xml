 against the wall. In this last game   
 they take it in turns to kick the ball
 against the wall. They have to drop   
 out if they miss the wall or the ball 
   The girls play tennis, skipping,    
 squash against the wall and sometimes 
 dab.                                  
   Other games are often played        
 together such as rounders, non-stop   
 cricket and touch using a soft ball.

 play a game where the members of one  
 team take it in turns to run from one 
 end of the yard to the other without  
 being caught by the other team.  M.E. </content>
