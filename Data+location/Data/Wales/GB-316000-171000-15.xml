		<title>15Housing in Penarth.</title>
		<content> The style of housing in our "D" block 
 ranges from large individually styled 
 Victorian homes, to the areas of pre- 
 war terraced and post war private and 
 council houses. There is also a       
 variety in the materials used ranging 
 from local limestone bricks, through  
 to slate and tiled roofing.           
   With the creation of the docks and  
 the coming of the railways in the late
 19th century,the town spread westward.
 Wealth ship owners created the large  
 houses in Westbourne, Plymouth,       
 Victoria and Stanwell Roads. Even as  
 recently as 1968 there was a farm at  
 the lower end of Corneswell Road, now 
 a heavily built up area, showing      
 spreading urban life.                 
   There are three main areas of modern
 development Llandough, Murch and Cow- 
 slip Estates. All a mixture of brick  
 terraced semis and detatched styles.  </content>
