		<title>14Welsh language in Flint</title>
		<content> Since the days of Edward the first,   
 Flint has been{linguistically an      
{English town-}the Welsh poet Lewis    
 Glyn Cothi writing "Dychan Saeson     
 Fflint". A few{Welsh names}survive,   
 like{Croes Ati and Allt Goch,}as well 
 as the{tradition of Codi Ha',}an      
 ancient May Day celebration where     
 people black their faces and dress in 
 white clothes. The visit of the       
{National Eisteddfod to Flint in 1969  
 helped to create a feeling of         
 Welshness. Today many road signs are  
{bilingual,}as well as signs in Boots  
 chemist. The male voice choir sing in 
 Welsh and Caersalem and Peniel chapels
 hold services in Welsh.{Ysgol Heol    
{Gaer}is shortly to become a{Welsh     
{medium school.}At present it has a    
 Welsh and English section and is      
 unusual because over 90% of the pupils
 come from English speaking homes.     </content>
