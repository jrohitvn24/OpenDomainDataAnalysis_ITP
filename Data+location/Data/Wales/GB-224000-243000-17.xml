		<content> Main water supply is available in the 
 area but in some cases the distance of
 the main from a property is           
 considerable and and the cost of      
 connection is prohibitive so a private
 supply is used.  Other households use 
 private water supplies from choice    
 considering the quality of the water  
 superior to mains supply particularly 
 after a recet incident of phenol      
 contamination.  Most properties pay   
 standard water rates but all farm     
 supplies from the mains are metered as
 large quantities are used.  No mains  
 sewerage system being available each  
 available each  property has its own  
 disposal system.  Wste disposal is    
 mostly by septic tank draining into   
 the subsoil.  The council houses in   
 Llandygwydd do not have indiviual     
 septic tanks but are all connected    
 to a small sewage disposal plant.     </content>
