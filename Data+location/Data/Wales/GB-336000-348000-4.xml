		<content> There are many companies both large   
 and small using premises on the       
 Industrial Estate.  Industry began    
 arriving in the area in 1946 expansion
 of the estate started in the 1960s but
 today firms are moving out.  One of   
 the largest Firestone tyres has closed
 Courtaulds Fibres are closing and many
 other small factory units have had to 
 close.  There are still a small number
 of large factories left Kellog's      
 cereals B.I.C.C. and Tetra Pak are    
 examples.  Smaller companies seem to  
 be service or light engineering       
 companies and also modern technology  
 firms.  One small garage deals        
 exclusvley with Morris 1000 cars and  
 parts.  The W.D.A. has an office on   
 the estate and they are now building  
 small advanced factory units.
