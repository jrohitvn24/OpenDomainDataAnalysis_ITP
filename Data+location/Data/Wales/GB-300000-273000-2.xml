		<title>02Land usage in Bwlchysarnau</title>
		<content> Bwlchysarnau is an upland area of poor
 wet acidic soil.Much drainage and     
 reseeding has altered the character of
 some of the fields, many of which were
 permanent pasture containing native   
 species of plants found in old hay    
 meadows and bogs.                     
    There are not many deciduous trees 
 in the area,mainly due to the height  
 (above 320m), the windswept terrain   
 and acid soil conditions. Extensive   
 sites were bought by the Forestry     
 Commission in 1930-40 and planted with
 coniferous trees.Much of this is now  
 reaching maturity and provides some   
 jobs;trimming and cleaning the trees, 
 some of which go for pulping and      
 others for stakes,posts and planking. 
 These areas are often used for car    
 rallies and motorcycle trials due to  
 the network of forestry tracks and    
 roads.                                </content>
