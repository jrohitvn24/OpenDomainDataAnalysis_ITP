		<title>09Living on Brooks Farm</title>
		<content> Brooks Farm is three hundred years    
 old. In the summer when it is very hot
 ducks come to swim on our pond with   
 their ducklings. In the morning I walk
 up the lane to catch the bus. When I  
 get past the gate there are pheasants 
 everywhere. When I get halfway up the 
 lane there are bulls in the field. It 
 is very quiet there. We have a brook  
 which runs through a field. We are    
 trying to make it run in the ditch    
 under the hedge because the field is  
 always wet. We have two dogs, two cats
 and two horses. We have a wreck of a  
 barn. We are trying to find out what  
 sort of barn it is. We think it is a  
 hay barn.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
