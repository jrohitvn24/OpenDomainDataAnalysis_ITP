		<content> The first settlement in Hope and      
 Caergwrle we are certain of existed at
 Caer Estyn.  Although there have been 
 some suggestions that it is           
 prehistoric, there is overwhelming    
 evidence that the fort originated     
 during Roman times. {(Local history)} 
                                       
 The area became a Christian one in the
 fifth century when a Saxon church was 
 erected.  It was a modest building of 
 wattle and daub.                      
                                       
 Although{religion}was a strong        
 feature in the area during Saxon      
 Britain, defence was of paramount     
 importance.  The urgency to subdue    
 Welsh attacks into England prompted   
 the construction of Wat's and Offa's  
 Dykes respectively, extensive sections
 of which can still be seen around the 
 area.                                 </content>
