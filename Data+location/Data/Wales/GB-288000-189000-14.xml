		<title>14Chapels &amp; Pubs in Pontycymer</title>
		<content> Main roads in South Wales valleys have
 their chapels, clubs, Pubs. Oxford    
 street in Pontycymer is no exception. 
  Built of locally quaried Pennant     
 stone, the chapels built to accomodate
 hundreds in days of revival remian as 
 religious havens for the faithful few 
 that get fewer each year.             
  Mount zion, Noddfa , and Carmel      
             now serve as reminders of 
  a time when sunday was a day of rest 
 and worship.                          
  Drinking beer has always accompanied 
 heavy manual work and despite         
 depression, strikes, redundancy and   
 unemployment, the pubs and clubs      
 flourish.                             
  Sunday opening of pubs, seen by some 
 as another threat to the traditional  
 Welsh Sunday, was only agreed in      
 1960's.                               
                                       </content>
