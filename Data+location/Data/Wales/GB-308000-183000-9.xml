		<content> My wife is quite happy here. She has  
 many friends in the village and is    
 always popping off to see them. She is
 also involved in many of the local    
 groups such as the Womens Institute   
 and the Friends of the School. They   
 always seem tobe organising jumble    
 sales and the like so this keeps her  
 quite occupied. She can drive the car 
 so she finds it easy to get over to   
 the shops in Taffs Well and once a    
 week we make a shopping trip to Asda  
 for the main buying.                  
 After a day at work, I tend to want to
 just get home and relax. I did play   
 football until a couple of years ago  
 but now I am happier just going off to
 the pub for a quiet drink.            
 Because this is such a friendly place,
 it is not too hard to get baby sitters
 so my wife and I manage to get out    
 together quite regularly.             </content>
