		<content>  Attitudes within the community have  
 changed over recent years.This used to
 be a very close knit community.Housing
 developments have now changed this and
 resulted in an influx from outside    
 areas.These new inhabitants are still 
 considered'outsiders'in the community.
  There are communal activities _ youth
 club,church anniversaries and O.A.P.'s
 dinners_all of which attempt to bring 
 the'old'and'new'communities together. 
  Although people are not quite as     
 close as they used to be, most do join
 together when faced with problems or  
 threats to the community,e.g.recently 
 a private firm applied for permission 
 to site an incinerator on the disused 
 aerodrome.The locals joined together  
 to oppose this development. Their main
 worry was over possible fumes and     
 pollution.The strenth of opposition   
 resulted in the plans being dropped.  </content>
