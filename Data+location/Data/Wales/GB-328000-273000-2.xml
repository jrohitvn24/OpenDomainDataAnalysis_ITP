		<content> Everyone living in the area has a     
 positive attitude to conservation and 
 is keen to preserve the natural       
 habitats of plants and animals,       
 believing this can be done alongside  
 farming. They are tolerant of visitors
 using footpaths across their land even
 when this leads to accidental         
 trespass, and are resigned to a       
 limited amount of poaching provided no
 damage is done to stock. As hill      
 farmers, they receive subsidies from  
 the E.E.C., but are very anti French  
 farmers. They are critical of a new   
 government scheme which pays for them 
 to employ a part-time secretary to    
 deal with VAT and other farm business.
 This is a compulsory order emanating  
 from the E.E.C. which they feel is    
 unnecessary and wasteful, and they    
 would prefer to deal with all their   
 business on their own.                </content>
