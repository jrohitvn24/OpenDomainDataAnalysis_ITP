		<title>18SOCIAL CONCERNS:SWANSEA WEST</title>
		<content> The local people interviewed were     
 concerned about a variety of issues,  
 including :_                          
 1) a recent murder in a Swansea "sex  
 shop":many thought that the shop      
 should be closed;                     
 2) children being housed in "highrise"
 flats:there were fears for the safety 
 of such children;                     
 3) the threat to the casualty unit at 
 Singleton Hospital:the distance to the
 alternative unit was too great;       
 4) litter on Gower beaches:many wanted
 action to clear up these places;      
 5) extension of Hendrefoilan Student  
 Village: the new buildings were seen  
 as a threat to the local woodlands;   
 6) some people are annoyed by buses   
 waiting outside their homes for long  
 periods with the engines running,     
 especially as there seemed to be few  
 passengers on these services.         </content>
