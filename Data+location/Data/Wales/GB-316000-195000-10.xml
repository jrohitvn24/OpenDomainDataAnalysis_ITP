		<title>10A visit to the doctor.</title>
		<content>      One evening I had an appointment 
 to see my doctor at the Health Centre,
 because the bones behind my ears were 
 swollen. My father took me in the car,
 and when we got inside the            
 receptionist told us to wait in the   
 waiting room. Eventually, she took us 
 down a corridor to wait outside the   
 doctors room. When the light above the
 door turned from red to green we went 
 inside. The doctor looked at my ears  
 and pressed the bone. He said I had   
 swollen glands. He wrote a            
 prescription for some cream, and we   
 collected it at the pharmacy on the   
 way out. The woman behind the counter 
 gave me a vitamin lolly and told me to
 put the cream on my ears twice a day. 
 After two weeks my swollen glands went
 down to normal size.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
