		<title>10BUILTH (W): ECOLOGY</title>
		<content>  The land around Builth is fertile    
 enough for woodland to grow naturally.
 The deciduous woodland includes ash,  
 beech ,alder, silver birch, elm, oak  
 and horse chestnut.                   
   There are also plantations where    
 pine trees predominate.The forestry   
 commission has planted these areas and
 the soft-wood can be used for         
 building and for making furniture.    
  There is a great variety of animals  
 in the woodlands,in the trees         
 themselves and in the thick           
 undergrowth ;toads,foxes,grey         
 squirrels,hedgehogs,blue tits and even
 the Great Spotted Woodpecker.There are
 lots of rookeries where crows build   
 their nests and breed.                
  The undergrowth is made up of        
 bracken,brambles,young trees and      
 different kinds of grasses.
