		<title>11LOCAL CUSTOMS IN LLANBISTER</title>
		<content>     In this area a death is marked,   
 most who knew the deceased having an  
 obligation to attend the funeral,which
 is a major event. The service is      
 usually held in a place of worship in 
 the afternoon. This is followed by a  
 simple tea provided by the family of  
 the deceased. Catering is undertaken  
 by friends or local women, in the     
 church hall or village premises.      
     Other customs involve business.   
 The farmers enjoy haggling over prices
 this can be offputting to an outsider.
 When the deal is finally struck the   
 cheque book is offered to the buyer   
 who fills in the details, as a sort of
 trust between them. The owner then    
 signs the completed cheque. This habit
 also takes place in shops and banks.  
     Luck Money in the form of a coin  
 is always given to a buyer of stock to
 ensure long life of the animals.      </content>
