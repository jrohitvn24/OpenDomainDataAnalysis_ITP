		<title>06A WEEK IN OUR SCHOOL (CONT)</title>
		<content> When we get home we usually watch T.V.
 or go out to play.Most of us have tea 
 at about 6.00pm and go to bed about   
 8.30pm or 9.00pm.                     
 The clubs we go to at home are        
 brownies, cubs and athletics club.    
 In cubs and brownies we play a lot of 
 games like starboard_we pretend we    
 are on a ship and Akela/Brown Owl     
 shouts out instructions.              
 Stoneage football_a cross between     
 soccer and rugby;there are no rules!! 
 Queens got a headache the queen and   
 king sit blindfolded at the top of the
 room.Someone has to steal the treasure
 from under their chair.If the queen   
 hears someone coming she nudges the   
 king who says " queens got a headache"
 and that person is out.               
 These are some of the things we do    
 during an ordinary week.
