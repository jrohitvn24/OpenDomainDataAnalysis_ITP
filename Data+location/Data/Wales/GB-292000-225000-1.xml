		<title>01A VILLAGE GROWS. DEFYNNOG</title>
		<content>  To the east of the block can be found
 bronze age standing stones, a Roman   
 road bisects the block and the parish 
 church and Lion pub boast early Norman
 patronage. Such data may be found in  
 the many and varied local histories.  
  The development of the village became
 static, even declined, with the coming
 of the railway in the 1850's. This    
 event saw the development and growth  
 of Sennybridge. The two villages have 
 now almost joined along the main      
 Brecon to Swansea road. However it    
 would be a mistake to confuse the two 
 communities, although both are now    
 greatly Anglicised Defynnog has been  
 able to maintain a core of Welshness  
 that Sennybridge seems to have lost.  
   The major industry of the area is   
 farming, mainly sheep but with some   
 milk, beef, root crops and a little   
 experimentation with cereals.         </content>
