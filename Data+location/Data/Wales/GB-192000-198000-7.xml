		<title>07GOLDBOROUGH FARM HUNDLETON</title>
		<content> Goldborough was originally a farm, but
 now the farmhouse is let separately   
 from the land.                        
 Mrs. Morris of Brownslate owns it and 
 a family by the name of Tucky lives in
 the house.                            
 This family has been in residence for 
 the past two years (1983-85). They    
 keep the garden tidy and they also    
 keep goats, chickens and ducks.       
 They also keep, as pets, a dog and two
 hamsters.                             
 They sell eggs in the W.I. market.
