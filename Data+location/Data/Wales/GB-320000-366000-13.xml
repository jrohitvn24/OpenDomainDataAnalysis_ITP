		<content> (Farming in the area has generally    
 changed very little.) The higher,     
 colder, exposed environment           
 conditions and thin stoney soils over 
 limestone around Rhosesmor still      
 restrict farms to rough pasture for   
 some cattle but mainly for Welsh      
 breeds of sheep reared for meat.      
 The more sheltered farms on the deeper
 soils around Rhydymwyn continue to    
 still support quite large Fresian     
 dairy herds and sheep on the lusher   
 pastures.Dairy and beef cattle herds  
 are also kept on farms North of       
 Soughton.                             
 Farming West of Soughton, though,     
 has shown great changes on the        
 Gwysaney Hall Estate,from traditional 
 sheep farming,based on pasture grown  
 on the dry glacial sands, to woodland.
