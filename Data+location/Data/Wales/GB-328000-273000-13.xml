		<content> The nearest Police station is in      
 Knighton and apart from an occasional 
 police car on the road from Knighton  
 to Clun there is neither sight of nor 
 need of law enforcement. The only     
 crime is the odd poaching of rabbits  
 and pheasants, which is tolerated by  
 the farmers and actively discouraged  
 by the gamekeeper on the Stanage      
 Estate. There has been an increase in 
 sheep and cattle rustling in the      
 border counties recently, but the last
 theft reported within this area was   
 six years ago when 11 lambs were      
 stolen.
