		<title>06A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>       I get up at 7.45 and wash       
 myself.For breakfast I have Alpen and 
 fruit juice.If there is time I watch  
 Breakfast T.V. At 8.30 I walk to      
 school with my friends and we play    
 cricket in the yard until the bell    
 rings at 9.00.                        
       My school is open plan and I am 
 in the J3/J4 unit.I have two teachers.
 In the morning we do S.M.P., maths and
 language.Dinner is at 12.00.In the    
 afternoon we do general studies, until
 school ends at 3.30.My primary school 
 is six years old and has lovely       
 grounds.We have a fish pond and a     
 football field.                       
       After eating my favourite tea,  
 pie and chips,I go out to play on my  
 BMX bike.I come in at 9.00 and watch  
 my own T.V. in my bedroom until I go  
 to bed at 10.30.
