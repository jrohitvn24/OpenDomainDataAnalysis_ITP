		<content> amusement arcades, snack bars and even
 a small fair. The Pensarn beach is one
 of contrasting land covers: near the  
 sea it is very sandy, but further on  
 towards Rhyl, the finer the sand      
 becomes; but near the top there is a  
 large area of wasteland, unsown and   
 little fertilised patches of grassland
 and stones- this is because the sea   
 does not reach that far except        
 occasionally in the spring mean tide. 
    A prominent feature of the Pensarn 
 beach is its wildlife, many types of  
 animals live around this area but by  
 far the most dominant are the birds.  
 Several types of birds can be seen    
 often gliding over the beach,         
 including:Herring Gulls; Common Gulls;
 Oyster Catchers; Ringed Plover, and   
 Mallard.
