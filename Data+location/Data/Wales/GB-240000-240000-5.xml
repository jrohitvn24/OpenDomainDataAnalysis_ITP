		<title>05NEW HOUSING IN LLANDYSUL</title>
		<content> Building land is scarce along the     
 valley sides so housing has developed 
 away from the original village. The   
 Beeches Housing Estate built in 1969  
 and 1972 has 131 dwellings. 16 private
 bungalows were built on the Parc yr   
 Ynn Estate in 1972 and 31 private     
 dwellings have been built on Llyn y   
 Fran Rd. All these are on the high    
 ground North of the village. In 1981  
 the 19 dwellings of the Tan y Bryn    
 Council Estate were completed south of
 Pontweli. Some private bungalows have 
 been built in the Gorrig area and     
 eastern edge of the village. The rest 
 of the area has isolated farm houses. 
 The{Antur Teifi Organisation}buys     
 vacant houses and, after improving    
 them, rents them to tenants. Building 
 seems likely to follow this pattern,  
 with further development above the    
 northern side of the village.         </content>
