		<title>16POLITICS : SWANSEA WEST</title>
		<content> The northern part of the area is      
 represented on Swansea City Council   
 and West Glamorgan County Council by  
 Labour Councillors, but the remainder 
 of the area is represented by         
 Conservatives.                        
 At national level, the whole area is  
 part of the Swansea West parliamentary
 constituency. The M.P. is Rt.Hon. Alan
 Williams, who is a front bench Labour 
 Party spokesman.                      
 There is a Community Council for      
 Killay. Its members are involved in   
 local issues such as the problem of   
 vandalism. This Council has little    
 power, but it tries to influence the  
 City and County Councils.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
