		<title>17COLWYN BAY MATERNITY HOME</title>
		<content> The maternity home is situated in     
 Nant_y_Glyn Road and has served the   
 community for over{forty years.}In the
 past most mothers gave{birth}there.The
 record number of babies born in one   
 year at the home was in 1961 when     
 there were 419 births.However,over    
 recent years the vast majority of     
 mothers have delivered their babies in
 the general hospitals at St.Asaph or  
 Bangor,{transferring}to Nant_y_Glyn   
 24 hours later.                       
   Mothers spend four to six days at   
 the home caring for their babies and  
 getting to{know}them.By the time that 
 they go home the mothers are well     
{rested}and far better equipped to cope
 with a new baby.                      
   The home also provides an{antenatal 
 service which consists of both clinics
 and classes. Unfortunately this home  
 is due to{close}later this year.      </content>
