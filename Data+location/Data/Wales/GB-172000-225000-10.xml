		<title>10Potato Picking.</title>
		<content>                                       
 My father works on a farm and early   
 summer is the busiest time of year,   
 because the potatos have to be picked.
 When the potato season starts it is   
 allgo, potato-pickers come to help and
 my mum has to help too.Most nights    
 after school my mum goes back to help 
 and my sister and I are left at home  
 until nine o'clock.On the weekend my  
 sister and I go over and help also.My 
 sister picks potatoes and I help to   
 weigh the bags and drive the tractor. 
 It is very difficult to sell the      
 potatoes at the beging of the season  
 because the prices are so low.        
 Hopefully as the potato season  goes  
 on,the prices will go up ,but it is   
 hard to tell when this will happen.The
 prices are Â£60 to Â£65 per tonne but   
 as the season goes on they will go    
 down to about Â£10 to Â£20 per tonne.   </content>
