 There are 18O sheep on the hill.      
 These are counted by the Ministry of  
 Agriculture every three years. They   
 are also inspected when they are being
 dipped.  Not all the sheep are sheared
 yet.  The farmers in the area will    
 join together and some men will come  
 and shear all the sheep together.  The
 sheep are Welsh sheep or Bualat on the
 hills.  The ewes are kept, but the    
 lambs are sold.  There are three      
 working dogs.  Unless a certain brand 
 of dip is used for the sheep then the 
 lambs cannot be shipped abroad.       
 Near Llandegfedd reservoir, Mr. Smith 
 has sixteen acres of hay.  They have  
 cut 1,2OO already.                    
 Life on a farm is very healthy, but   
 tied.  Mr. Smith has not had a day off
 yet in 15 years.                      </content>
