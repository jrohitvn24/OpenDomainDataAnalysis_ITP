		<title>09Llanharan Open Coal Mine</title>
		<content> Since the closure of{Llanharan        
{Colliery}in 1962 the area has         
 developed into one of the largest     
 opencast sites in the country. The    
 fact that{Llanharan}stands on the     
 Southern outcrop of the South Wales   
 coalfied means that the coal is near  
 the surface and{open cast}mining is   
 economical. The coal produced at the  
 mine is coking coal and is used in    
 steel works at Port Talbot.About half 
 a million tons per year are produced. 
    The N.C.B. and the contractors     
 Derek Crouch wish to extend the site, 
 but there is a great deal of local    
 opposition.                           
    When the life of the open cast mine
 comes to an end, the land will be     
 restored, with some returning to      
 agriculture, some to forestry and some
 becoming a lake.It is hoped that the  
 area will become a tourist attraction.</content>
