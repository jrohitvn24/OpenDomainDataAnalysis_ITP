  Young men belong to the Rowen Young  
 Farmers' Club which provides many     
 cultural and recreational activities. 
 Some of the residents belong to an    
 excellent Art Club and their work is  
 exhibited annually at the Community   
 Centre of Rowen. There is also a      
 thriving Country Dancing Club. The    
 Women's Institute is an organisation  
 of great interest to the ladies of    
 this area. It meets once a month in   
 the old Baptist Chapel at Rowen and   
 members take an active part in all    
 aspects of life in the community. At  
 the nearby village of Talybont there  
 is an active Young Wives Group and    
 older residents are members of the    
 Darby and Joan Club there.
