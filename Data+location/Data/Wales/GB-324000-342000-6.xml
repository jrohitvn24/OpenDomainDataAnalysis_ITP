		<content> This Plant was founded in 1867 by     
{Robert Ferdinand Graesser,a German    
 chemist,to extract oils and  wax from 
 shale available  from neighbouring    
 collieries.It became{Monsanto's}first}
 investment outside the U.S. in 1920.A 
 great number of people from the Garth 
 &amp; Trevor communities work there.      
 Monsanto's Ruabon plant is on a steep 
 hillside at{Cefn Mawr,eight  miles    
 south  of{Wrexham}and 40 miles south  
 of Liverpool.The plant is close to the
{River Dee},overlooking the famous     
 aqueduct built by{Thomas Telford}to   
 carry the{Shropshire Union Canal}over 
 the river.                            
 The history of the Ruabon plant as a  
 manufacturing location is a long      
 one. Today,about 40,000 tonnes of     
 chemical products are dispatched from 
 the plant each year and approximately 
{580 people work at the plant.         </content>
