		<title>07Leeswood-Local History</title>
		<content>  Since the beginning of the 20th      
 century the Leewood area has changed  
 in many ways; shops for instance.This 
 was a well-supplied village with a    
 Co-op store and three village shops.  
   Sometimes a horse and cart from Mold
 would come and deliver orders which   
 had been placed the week before.      
  Local employment was plentiful with  
 the colleries and iron works.Not many 
 women worked until a clothing factory 
 opened in Leeswood.In the 1980's more 
 women work in Leeswood than men.      
  People walked until the pushbikes    
 came out and everyone relied on them. 
 Rich people owned most horses and     
 carts.                                
  Holidays were not abroad.Summer      
 holidays were usually spent in Rhyl.  
 Children only had holidays when the   
 school term had ended.
