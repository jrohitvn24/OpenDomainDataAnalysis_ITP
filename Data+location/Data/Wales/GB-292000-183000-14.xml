		<content>  The first chapel,{Bethel Hen,}was    
 built in 1820. Between 1890 and 1920  
 four other denominations had          
 established churches in the village.  
 At the end of the last century{St.    
{Paul's,}was built and the Baptists,   
{Methodists and Pentecostals  }        
 established churches during the early 
 years of this century. In 1906 Bethel 
 Hen was replaced by a larger          
 chapel,{Bethel Newydd.}               
  Since the '50s there has been a      
 gradual decline in the numbers        
 attending churches. The Methodist     
 church has been demolished,the        
 Pentecostals have left their Mission  
 Hall and re-established their church  
 in the former Baptist chapel and the  
 Anglican and Annibynwyr Cymreig are   
 struggling to maintain their numbers. 
 The Sunday attendance at the three    
 churches would not even fill one.     </content>
