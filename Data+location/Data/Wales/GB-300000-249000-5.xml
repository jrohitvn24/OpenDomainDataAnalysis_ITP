		<content>             FACILITIES                
  There is a wide range of recreational
 facilities avalible in this small     
 market town.The most popular place for
 children is a playing field alongside 
 the river Wye,called the Groe.Here    
 there are swings,roundabouts and      
 slides;there is also a rugby pitch    
 during the winter.                    
  The tennis courts are very popular   
 during the summer and are used by the 
 high school,town tennis club and the  
 public.The open air swimming pool has 
 recently been opened,it is very       
 popular when the weather is hot.      
 Hopefully the pool will be covered    
 over in future.                       
  The Sports Hall was opened in 1980.It
 is used by the high school in the day 
 and by the public in the evenings.

 netball and table-tennis.             </content>
