		<content>   People from the{Cwmffrwdoer}and     
{Pentrepiod}area are afraid that       
{dangerous waste chemicals}are being   
 dumped at the nearby Tirpentwys tip.  
   They are afraid that this will{cause
{pollution, attract flies and vermin.  
 They also feel that community life    
 will be threatened by the refuse -    
 laden lorries go through the narrow   
 roads in the residential area.  They  
 also stress that Tirpentwys tip is    
 being used to dump{substances that    
{could endanger life.                  
  {Reporter Mandy Langley}pointed out  
 that{"all liquid and any material,    
{poisonous or toxic in itself, or when 
{mixed with other substances, were     
{banned."                              
   Another meeting will be arranged in 
 the future when councillors, council  
 officers and local Euro MP's will dis-
 cuss and be asked to lead the protest.</content>
