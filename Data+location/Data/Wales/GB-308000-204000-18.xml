 Fochriw was the same size in 1965 as  
 it is today.There were more children  
 going to school.There was no Nursery  
 or Community Centre.The Cae Glas      
 Estate was still standing.By now most 
 houses had hot and cold water,        
 electric, power for lighting and      
 cooking and gas on the new estate.Some
 houses had central heating because    
 people could afford it.People had more
 money and leisure time.The men worked 
 in the pits and factories.The women   
 worked in the factories.There were as 
 many women employed as men.The bus    
 service was good but the railways were
 declining. People had cars.Private    
 buses took people on holiday or days  
 out.Rugby supporters flew to France   
 and Ireland. Some people could now    
 afford to take holidays abroad.
