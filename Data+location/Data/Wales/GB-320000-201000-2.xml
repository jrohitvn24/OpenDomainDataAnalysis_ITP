		<content>{An account written by Claire Evans.   
 My nan has lived here for fifty nine  
 years.There has been many changes,such
 as Coronation Cottages being pulled   
 down,levelled out,seeded and made into
 a playingfield which is opposite my   
 house.Above that is the lower part of 
 the rugby field where there used to be
 houses called Gilfach Cottages.       
   There was an infants' school on the 
 mountain called Six Bells Infants and 
 there was a school at the bottom of   
 the Cemetery Road which is now a      
 warehouse.There has also been two     
 chapels closed in recent years.       
   The shopping area has changed very  
 much.The undertaker's parlour, Flock's
 sweet shop,Tossels' cobblers and the  
 cafe have all closed.Many other shops 
 have also closed.The Vivian colliery  
 has also closed down.
