		<content> The{Aeron Valley}runs inland from     
 Aberaeron in an E-SE direction.The    
{River Aeron}meanders across the flat  
 flood plain of the valley which has   
{steep wooded sides.} These steep      
 slopes are wooded because they are not
 suitable for agriculture.The valley   
 floor and plateau at a height of      
{300-400feet}are farmed by mainly beef 
 and dairy farms.                      
 The{coastline}has many{sandy beaches  
 and{coves,}but Aberaeron has a pebble 
 beach. The{cliffs}on the south are old
 steep,old,and over 200ft in place.From
 Aberaeron to Aberarth, the old cliffs 
 now only 50 ft high are covered by    
 boulder clay. These cliffs crumble and
 erode easily.                         
 The gradient up to the school is      
 approximately 1 in 5, a very steep    
 climb especially if its raining, snowy
 or covered in ice.                    </content>
