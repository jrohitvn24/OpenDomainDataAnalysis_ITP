		<content>{Roads:}Although the area is  covered  
 with numerous single track and minor  
 roads, there is only one major road   
 which passes through the 12 km. block.
 This is the  A541 which links the     
 towns of Wrexham and Mold and joins a 
 network of other major roads          
 connecting {Clwyd} to other parts of  
 North Wales and Cheshire.             
 The A541 is particularly busy between 
 8a.m. and 9a.m. and from 4p.m. and    
 6pm. in the Abermorddu area.          
 Local people interviewed were         
 concerned about noise,pollution and   
 traffic hazards. A number of serious  
 accidents have occurred on the road in
 recent years. However, opinion was    
 split on the issue of a proposed      
 by-pass, even though sections have    
 been completed as far as Cefnybedd.
