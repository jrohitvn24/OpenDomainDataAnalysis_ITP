		<title>15LOCAL HISTORY SYCHDYN HALL</title>
		<content>  This Elizabethan Hall is situated  11
 miles from Chester, 6 miles from      
 Holywell and 4 miles from Hawarden. It
 was owned by a Mr Howard until 1912   
 when it was taken over by Mrs         
 Alexander Reith Gray, who lived there 
 until her death in 1942. It was then  
 bought by a Mr Towers who has restored
 it to its original splendour.The      
 buildings and grounds cover a total of
 60 acres and include the main hall,a  
 lounge, library, five large bedrooms, 
 kitchen and scullery, a rare oak      
 staircase and a butler's pantry. It   
 also includes extensive gardens and   
 farm out buildings. The house contains
 many priceless antiques collected by  
 the owners including a unique set of  
 bookcases made in 1790. The original  
 Domesday Survey of 1085-6 noted the   
 existance of a building on this site  
 at that time.                         </content>
