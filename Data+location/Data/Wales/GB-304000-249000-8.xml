		<title>08SCHOOL DINNERS</title>
		<content> School dinners have changed           
 considerably over the past few years. 
 Up until about five years ago, we all 
 had to eat exactly the same dinners   
 but then everything changed and we    
 began to have a very wide choice of   
 meal. Then, a few months ago, things  
 changed again and now we only get a   
 choice of a Mini (50p) or a Maxi (70p)
 meal but we do have a snack shop where
 we can buy rolls, sandwiches and      
 chips. We can also buy sweets and     
 drinks. Many children bring their own 
 sandwiches as the prices of our       
 dinners have gone up and up.          
 At Christmas, the cooks do a Christmas
 dinner which costs 70p. I asked four  
 of my friends what they thought of    
 school dinners and they said          
 "Rubbery","Revolting,but good chips", 
 "Allright except for faggots" and     
 "Just vile!"                          </content>
