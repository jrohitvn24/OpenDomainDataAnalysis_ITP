		<content>{An interview with my Grandmother      
 My Grandmother has lived in Deganwy   
 all her life and has seen these       
 changes.Our Deganwy school used to be 
 opposite the All Saints Hall but that 
 building is now the Sea Cadets        
 headquaters.Our school was built where
 a field used to be.Behind Bethal      
 Chapel on Pentywyn Road was a field   
 with a stream running through it where
 tadpoles and newts could be caught,now
 Bungalows have been built there.Some  
 houses next to the Maggie Murphys Pub 
 have been pulled down to make a       
 carpark.On Deganwy beach was a landing
 stage where years ago a Paddle Steamer
 called to take passengers up the      
 Conwy River to Trefriw and Tal Y Cafn.
 It would then stop and allow people   
 off to have teas and enjoy themselves.
