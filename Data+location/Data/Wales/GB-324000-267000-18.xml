		<title>18Local History</title>
		<content> The people in this area are not really
 English or Welsh. In the past the area
 has been raided by Owain Glyndwr and  
 the English (the Mortimers were often 
 involved) with the local population   
 suffering under both and perhaps not  
 quite knowing with whom they belong.  
 The situation continues today - the   
 area is in Powys and therefore Wales  
 but very few indeed speak with a Welsh
 accent let alone speak Welsh. Welsh is
 not taught in most of the primary     
 schools and it is not possible to     
 receive Welsh television - the area   
 receives tv transmissions from the    
 English Midlands.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
