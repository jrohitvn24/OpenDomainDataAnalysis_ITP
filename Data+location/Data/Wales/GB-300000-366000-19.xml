		<title>19THE LLINDIR INN, HENLLAN</title>
		<content>                                       
    Together with the Church and       
 chapel, this picturesque village pub  
 forms a focal point for the local     
 people. It was built as early as 1229 
 and has thick stone walls and a       
 thatched roof. During the eighteenth  
 century it became a welcome coaching  
 stop on the London to Holyhead route. 
    The inn is reputed to have a ghost 
 which haunts the older parts of the   
 house in the early hours. According to
 legend,the lady of the inn was murder-
 ed when her husband returned unexpec- 
 tedly to find her with her lover.     
    The interior of the inn retains its
 character _ with old beams,wheel-back 
 chairs,copper and brass ware.         
    The Llindir is now the only village
 hostelry; its companion - the Cross   
 Foxes - closed some years ago.
