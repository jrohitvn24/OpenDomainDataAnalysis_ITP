		<title>11The Welsh Language</title>
		<content> Although English is the most important
 language of the area, there is now a  
 revival of Welsh. A growing awareness 
 of, and interest in, the language in  
 recent years has led to the develop-  
 ment of Welsh medium education. Gwent 
 L.E.A. makes no pre-school provision  
 in Welsh, but in Risca there is a     
 flourishing Welsh playgroup run by    
 enthusiastic volunteers, most of whom 
 are themselves Welsh learners. As a   
 consequence of this activity, Welsh   
 units are being set up in primary     
 schools. No secondary schools locally 
 offer Welsh, apart from a Link Course 
 in which Risca Comprehensive pupils   
 attend Crosskeys College. This has    
 created a demand for "O" and "A" Level
 Welsh at the College. There has also  
 been a large increase in the number of
 Welsh classes at Adult Education      
 Centres in recent years.              </content>
