		<content> A large cross section of the public   
 took part in our survey into local    
 attitudes to the arera and ammenities.
 The overall impressions were that most
 people whilst satisfied with the area 
 and its{administration}they felt that 
 there were certain areas which could  
 be improved.                          
 These areas were{public services,}such
 as a more frequent bus service to the 
 major towns and a larger number of    
 telephone kiosks for public use.  Also
 some people expressed the fear that a 
 large number of public buildings in   
 the area were falling in to disrepair 
 some to the point of demolition.      
 Within Brynamman it was felt strongly 
 that all efforts should be made to    
 preserve the{Public Hall.}
