 asked, "What changes have taken place 
 since you were a child?"              
{"Litter has increased and in the past 
{there were local street cleaners but  
{these no longer exist."               
{"We used to see colliers getting on   
{and off the Aberaman Colliery bus.When
{they had finished work they would be  
{covered in coal dust and we would     
{dread catching that bus because our   
{clothes would get dirty."             
{"Nowadays you are lucky to see a      
{policeman in the street."             
{"We think children are more unruly and
{destructive and there is less respect 
{for other people and their property." 
{"Traffic has increased. The only      
{traffic in our day was the Co-op bread
{man and the pop man."                 
{"Corner shops have also disappeared." </content>
