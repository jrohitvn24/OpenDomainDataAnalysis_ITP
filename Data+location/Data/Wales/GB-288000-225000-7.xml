		<content> The whole area is either grassland    
 or moorland.  The lower fields may    
 be classed as intensively managed,    
 being pastures which are used for the 
 production of hay or silage during    
 summer to be fed to the stock during  
 winter and early spring.These pastures
 are occasionally ploughed and seeded  
 in order to improve the quality of    
 the grass. Along the valley sides     
 there are occasional patches of scrub 
 or relict woodland. These are mainly  
 deciduous, comprising oak,beech,birch,
 chestnut and rowan according to expos-
 ure to the wind and the extent to     
 which sheep graze there during winter 
 and spring.   Fforest Fach itself is  
 an interesting mixture of             
 short-cropped bilberry and grass, with
 large invasive patches of bracken.
