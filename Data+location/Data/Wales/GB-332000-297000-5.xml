		<title>05Shelve Village</title>
		<content> In the village there are four farms   
 and a church. It is very{small}and    
 there are not many people. As we      
 walked into the village from the West 
 we passed Silage Tanks which smelled  
 horrible and made you feel ill. There 
 are{no shops}and I think it would be  
 boring to live there. There was a     
 Postbox and a small pond with some    
 ducks. All around the churchyard      
 there was a small stone wall. East of 
 Shelve near the road amongst some old 
 Mine workings some{wild orchids}can be
 seen.
