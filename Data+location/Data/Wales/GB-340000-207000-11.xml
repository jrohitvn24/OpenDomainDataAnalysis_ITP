   Each Year Raglan Action Research for
 the crippled child holds a five mile  
 fun run.This year it was held on the  
 5th May.Each runner had a number.A    
 local hospital gave a radio commentary
 of the race.A computer registered the 
 times of each person and a marshal    
 gave the people their times on a      
 certificate.It was well organised and 
 about 800 people walked or ran.The run
 raised Â£4,000.A thankyou evening was  
 organised for the helpers of the run, 
 medals and certificates were given out
 and a video of the Fun Run was shown.
