		<title>18SHOPPING SURVEY</title>
		<content> Our class conducted a survey of 20    
 shops in the Risca area by making up a
 questionnaire of 18 questions and     
 sending them to 20 different shops. We
 found out some very interesting       
 things.                               
{SATURDAY}is the busiest day of the    
 week for all the shops we asked. We   
 think this is because most people     
 don't work then so they have time for 
 shopping.                             
 We asked the shops how many customers 
 they had altogether over Monday,      
 Thursday and Saturday. The busiest was
 a newsagent with 2900 customers (this 
 beat even a supermarket which had     
 2200). The least busy shop was a car  
 sales with only about 40 customers.   
 The longest any of the shopkeepers has
 been working in Risca is 55 years.    
 This is{McCartheys'}the grocer.
