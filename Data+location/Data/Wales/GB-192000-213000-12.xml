		<title>12Housing in Haverfordwest(1)</title>
		<content> The town and surrounding countryside  
 contains housing of varying ages.The  
 old part of the town consists of      
 terraced housing, sash windows, with  
 doors opening onto the pavement, in   
 the form of large town houses and     
 small two up two down properties.     
 The general style is of block, brick  
 or stone with cement rendering, long  
 narrow windows and steep slate        
 roofs.There have recently been        
 restrictions on new building in the   
 countryside.They are now mainly       
 agriculturally linked.Most of the     
 farmhouses are of more than 100 years 
 old.Many have new bungalows built     
 beside them for married children or   
 retired parents.All new building must 
 now comply with the planning          
 regulations laid down by the Housing  
 Department ensuring the Pembrokeshire 
 style of windows, roofs and materials.</content>
