		<content> 3.Water was taken from the river and  
 only some houses had gas lights.      
 4.The biggest changes were the growth 
 and decline of industry and the       
 establishment of an enterprise zone.  
 There are large stores e.g. Tesco and 
 MFI which had increased traffic.      
 5.Miss Bodycombe said that families   
 were bigger and there was little to   
 eat.She remembered asking her mother  
 what was for tea and being told "a    
 piece of bread and the lovely smell   
 from next door!".                     
 6.Mr. Lloyd Jones told us he had very 
 little pocket money and when he       
 started work he earned only a few     
 shillings each month.We enjoyed the   
 interviews and learned a lot about our
 area.
