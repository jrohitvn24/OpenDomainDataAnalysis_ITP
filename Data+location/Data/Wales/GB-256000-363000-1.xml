		<title>01The 'Foothills' of Snowdonia</title>
		<content> The major part of the areal survey    
 lies above 900' above sea level.  An  
 area of heather, coarse wet grassland 
 with devastatingly beautiful views of 
 Anglesey and on a clear day, Ireland. 
 Once quarrying was the main occupation
 of the villages of Rhiwlas (Penrhyn   
 Quarry) and Deiniolen (Llanberis      
 Quarry).  Nowadays most workers in the
 village work in Caernarfon, Bangor.   
 Both villages are socially unconnected
 Rhiwlas being now a dormitory village 
 for Bangor - with its light industry, 
 shops and University.  Deiniolen is   
 far more closely allied to Caernarfon 
 - light industry, County Council HQ,  
 etc.  The hinterland for both villages
 is the Snowdonia 'massif' - some small
 industry at Deiniolen reflect the     
 'leisure' pursuits of the area -      
 Clogwyn industries make hardware for  
 climbers.  About 50% of each village  </content>
