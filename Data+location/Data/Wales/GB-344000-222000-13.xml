		<title>13Garway Traffic Survey</title>
		<content> For two weeks we recorded details of  
 all the cars that passed the school   
 between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. We noted the
 cars' direction, driver, colour, make 
 and registration letter.              
       During that time about 10 per   
 cent more cars went down the road     
 (towards Hereford) than up it.        
       Male drivers outnumbered females
 in a ratio of 5:3.                    
       On average about 15 cars per    
 hour passed the school. Mondays and   
 Tuesdays were slightly busier than    
 other days, perhaps because they are  
 playgroup days and the playgroup is   
 just down the road.                   
       The most common registration    
 letter was Y, followed by X, V, T, W  
 and B.                                
       This was an unusual traffic     
 survey, as we often knew who was      
 driving and where they were going.    </content>
