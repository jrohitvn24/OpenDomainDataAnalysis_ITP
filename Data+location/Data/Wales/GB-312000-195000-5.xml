		<content>{My farm by Calvin Thomas.             
 I live on Glan-y-nant farm in the     
 Pengam region.The old name for the    
 farm was Tir-Pengam.                  
 It is 350 years old,covers 50 acres   
 and is now called Green-meadow farm.  
 About 150 years ago my farm land      
 extended over Glan-y-nant up to the   
 bus depot.It had many green           
 fields,and there were lanes from the  
 farm to the villages of Cascade and   
 Ystrad Mynach.The council bought the  
 land and built houses on the ground.  
 they also built a main road through   
 the centre of the farm.Most of the    
 land is intensively managed grass land
 for grazing.Horses are tacked,and     
 silage is produced annually.
