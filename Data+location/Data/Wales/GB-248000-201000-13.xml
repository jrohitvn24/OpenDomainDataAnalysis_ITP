		<content> Adriano Candelori was born in the town
 of Terni,near Assisi.The consciousness
 of beauty in Architecture,Painting and
 Sculptures,is close to the Italian way
 of life,as they live,work and play    
 among the treasures and sculptures    
 that abound around them.  Inspired by 
 this love of beauty and the creative  
 desire to reproduce it in every form  
 of art,Adriano has strived to continue
 to add to the achievements of the     
 past,for the future. In his early days
 he was unfortunate in that his sensit-
 ivity and love of art and beauty was  
 suffocated by the Second World War and
 the German occupation of Terni. After 
 the war,the rebuilding and search for 
 work compelled many to leave home and 
 country to look for work outside      
 war-torn Italy.{Adriano came to Wales,
{to Llanelli, to work for the Steel    
{Company of Wales.                     </content>
