		<title>11A Day in My Life</title>
		<content>               I get up and get dressed
 about 8 o'clock. Then I have breakfast
 and clean my teeth. I walk to{school }
 and at 9 o'clock the whistle goes and 
 school begins.                        
                We always start the    
 school day with prayers. In the       
 morning, we do maths and English and  
 in the afternoon we do our            
 projects,art and craft or games. Our  
 school day is broken by two play      
 times: one in the morning and one in  
 the afternoon, while at 12 o'clock we 
 go for lunch.Our lunch break lasts for
 an hour. Then the whistle is blown to 
 tell us it is time for school to begin
 again.                                
              At half past three,      
 school finishes and I go home for my  
 tea. Between tea and bedtime, I'll    
 either play or watch television. I    
 usually go to bed at half past 8.     </content>
