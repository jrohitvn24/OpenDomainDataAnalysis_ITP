		<title>19Llandegai School</title>
		<content>      The school starts and finishes at
 the same time as most schools, nine   
 till half past three. However on      
 Fridays the children are allowed to do
 what ever they want. Every year a     
 childs mother and father gets a report
 card on their childs progress.        
      Llandegai competes against other 
 schools in the interschool sports and 
 have won a few shields and cups. Every
 year they also have their own sports  
 day.                                  
      Out of the 139 pupils only 100   
 have school dinners, the others are a 
 mixture between children who go home  
 for lunch and those that take packed  
 lunches.                              
      If they are naughty they get sent
 to Mr.Jones the headmaster and either 
 get a good telling off or a smack on  
 the bottom.
