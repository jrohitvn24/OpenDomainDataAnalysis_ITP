		<title>02BUILTH WELLS,POWYS CONT.</title>
		<content> During the Nineteenth Century,the town
                                       
 became renowned for its spa at Park   
 Wells which produced exceptionally    
 strong saline water. During the period
 of popularity enjoyed by its mineral  
 waters,Builth's population expanded   
 and many large town villas were built 
 mostly using local stone quarried at  
 Llanelwedd.                           
 The great Welsh Prince, Llewelyn,is   
 thought to have died at the hands of  
 English soldiers nearby and a stone   
 obelisk has been erected to his memory
 at Cilmeri.                           
 Very little remains of Builth's Norman
 castle except a large moated mound.   
 Builth has a thriving Arts Centre at  
 Wyeside which incorporates a theatre, 
 cinema,exhibition gallery,workshops   
 and a restaurant.
