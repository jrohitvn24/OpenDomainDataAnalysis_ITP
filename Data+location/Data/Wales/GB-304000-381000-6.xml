		<title>06A DAY IN OUR LIVES</title>
		<content> My name is Suzanne Ayers,I am 11 years
 old.Every Friday night after school I 
 go to Ellen's house.As soon as we get 
 home we get changed into our normal   
 everyday clothes.Then we go out to    
 play until Ellen's mum calls us in and
 we watch television.Later we make our 
 packed lunches for the following day  
 as we go Morris-dancing every         
 Saturday.After that we have a wash    
 and get changed for bed.Sometimes we  
 do the ironing or the washing.Then    
 make Ellen's mum and ourselves a cup  
 of tea.We go to bed about 10-30pm.In  
 the morning we quickly get washed and 
 changed.When we have finished our     
 breakfast we get our bags ready.Then  
 we set off towards the Jolly Sailor   
 where the coach picks us up.Each      
 weekend we go to different places so  
 that means we have to get up at       
 different times.                      </content>
