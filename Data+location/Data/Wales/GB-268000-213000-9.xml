		<title>09HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> Home life within the area is often    
 affected by the{large number of       
{unemployed. }Whereas no family        
 actually suffers real hardship there  
 is a difference between families where
 the parents are in work and those     
 families where the parents are        
 unemployed.                           
 We found no real difference in the    
 families material goods e.g. all      
 families had televisions, freezers    
 etc. and most families, where there   
 were qualified drivers, also had cars.
 One indication of a lower income we   
 did find was in the pets kept by these
 families.  Whereas most working       
 families had large pets e.g. dogs,cats
 etc. we found that the most popular   
 pet for unemployed families was a     
 goldfish the reason we felt for this  
 was the expense of keeping large pets.
