		<content> A rural area with a small influx of   
 modern urban settlement.  There is an 
 educational annexe in this square     
 which at one time catered for Mature  
 students of the Glamorgan college of  
 Education.  It still has facilities   
 for education and is used by the Barry
 College of Further Education.  A large
 part of this area is wooded and it    
 includes a hawking centre.  The Welsh 
 Hawking Centre opened at Weycock Road 
 in 1980 when the former Cardiff Zoo   
 which was based on the same site      
 closed.  Traditional zoo animals such 
 as monkeys, lions and tigers have     
 moved out.  The centre now houses     
 probably one of the inest collections 
 of hawks and other birds of prey in   
 South Wales.
