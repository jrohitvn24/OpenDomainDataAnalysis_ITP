		<title>14Housing in the Uzmaston area</title>
		<content> Uzmaston (once a hamlet) has in 1985  
 over 200 households with a population 
 of 500+. Near the Church are a few 3  
 or 4 room cottages (rented or provided
 with employment) and 8 Council Houses 
 built post 1945 for agricultural      
 workers (6 of Airey construction)     
 overlooking the Village Green.        
 On Uzmaston and New Roads houses and  
 bungalows are generally larger,       
 averaging 7 rooms, built between 1900 
 and 1984. An estate of about 80       
 detached homes, (varied in design and 
 owner occupied) has been built during 
 the last decade on Bethany Fields.    
 Along Cartlett, near the Station, are 
 older properties, some with 10+ rooms.
 Bethany Row houses on A.40 are being  
 reconstructed and modernised.  Farm-  
 -houses date from the last century or 
 earlier. Most exteriors are roughcast 
 and white or pastel coloured.         </content>
