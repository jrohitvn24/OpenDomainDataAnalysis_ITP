		<title>10My Grandad's Daily Routine.</title>
		<content> My grandfather usually gets up at 8.30
 a.m. has some toast and a cup of tea  
 then goes to sit on the seat with his 
 former workmates. He talks about the  
 1960's when he used to work in the    
 Washery. At 12 0'clock we all have    
 dinner. After dinner he gets coal,    
 chops wood and lights the fire then   
 watches T.V. If it is fine he'll go   
 into the garden and do some gardening.
 At 4.20 he has tea then cuts the grass
 or does some gardening. At 8.50 he    
 goes home and at 9.30 he has some     
 toast for supper watches T.V. and is  
 in bed by 11 o'clock.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
