		<title>15Housing in Llanelli.</title>
		<content>  The majority of the housing in our   
 block is of the terraced type,since   
 our area contains the oldest part of  
 Llanelli.Naturally there are          
 semi-detached and detached houses     
 also and some blocks of flats,but     
 none of the flats have more than      
 three storeys.The flats and many of   
 the houses are owned by the           
 Council,but on the older Council      
 estates many of the houses are now    
 privately owned.New Council Estates   
 are being erected in our area at      
 present,on land once used by          
 industry.The new houses are brick     
 built as are most of those in the     
 block.Until recently,local brick was  
 used,but now all the brick works      
 have closed.Roofs are covered by      
 tiles,and tile roofs are now in the   
 majority over the traditional slate   
 roofs..                               </content>
