		<content>     Our D-block is mainly comprised   
 of agricultural land and a number of  
 linked villages({Gwersyllt,Pentre     
{Broughton,New Broughton, Tanyfron,    
{Brymbo and parts of Coedpoeth )}which 
 grew up around local industry such as 
 coal mining and steelmaking.These at  
 one time were the major employers     
 within the area. However,coalmining as
 an industry does not exist within the 
 block and Brymbo Steelworks is now    
 producing high grade,low alloy steel  
 employing a much reduced workforce.   
     Agricultural land within the area 
 falls into two main categories-rough  
 grazing and grass grown for silage or 
 hay.Farming is concentrated on dairy  
 cattle and sheep rearing.             
     High unemployment within the area 
 has led to an increased demand for    
 leisure facilities.
