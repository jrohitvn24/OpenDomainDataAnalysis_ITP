 I got up at 7.45a.m. I got dressed and
 had a breakfast of toast,cornflakes   
 and orange-juice.I then washed,brushed
 my teeth and combed my hair.Afterwards
 I went over to the shops with my      
 family.I bought sweets and went for my
 friends Leanne and Tanya to go to     
 school at 9.15.For dinner at school I 
 had bacon and chips followed by       
 chocolate cake and white sauce.During 
 morning and afternoon playtimes I     
 played netball with my friends.After  
 school my Nan took my sister and me to
 Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre by car.We    
 went in the pool for a swim and then  
 Nan took us home in time for supper.I 
 had beans on toast and got ready for  
 bed.I read for half an hour and went  
 to sleep.
