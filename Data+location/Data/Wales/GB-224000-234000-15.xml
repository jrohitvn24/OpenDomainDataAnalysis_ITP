		<title>15A Bwlch-y-groes yard game</title>
		<content> One of the games we play on the school
 yard is called "horses".To play the   
 game you will need some skipping      
 ropes.Any number of children can      
 play.Some of the children have to be  
 owners.The owners have two horses     
 each.Their names are usually Black    
 Beauty,Brandy,Victoria,Twinkletoes,   
 Sugar or Flicker.The children who are 
 left out are the horses.The horses'   
 reins are the skipping ropes which go 
 around the horses' waists while the   
 owners hold on to the ends.To start   
 the horses,the owners whip the        
 reins and shout something like        
 "yahoo".The owners run their horses in
 races against each other.When the     
 bell rings for the end of playtime,   
 the horses are turned out into their  
 paddock,which are the school          
 fields.This is a game we really enjoy.
