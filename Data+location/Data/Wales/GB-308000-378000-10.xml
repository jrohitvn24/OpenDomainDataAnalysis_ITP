		<content> The Crown Inn is the only surviving   
 public house in Trelawnyd, and is     
 situated on the main road.  In the    
 summer season it provides lunch time  
 food.  A small percentage of its      
 customers reside in Trelawnyd, though 
 the Crown is undoubtedly a major      
 meeting place.                        
 The landlord enjoys playing a leading 
 role in the community life through    
 organising a wide variety of fund     
 raising events.  He has raised        
 approximately Â£900 per annum for local
 causes, e.g. Village School, Hospital 
 Appeal, Village Hall.  The landlord,  
 with the help of his customers,       
 annually provides a bus for O.A.P.'s  
 outings. They also arrange a free Fire
 work Display and celebrate fully any  
 special day with a carnival           
 atmosphere.The Crown Inn runs various 
 competitions and quizzes.             </content>
