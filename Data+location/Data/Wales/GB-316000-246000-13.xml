		<content>  As in many rural areas there is a    
{travelling library}service. It calls  
 in the area every other Wednesday and 
 has done so for the past 15 years.    
 Painscastle has around 15 borrowers   
 and Rhosgoch has 8. Lack of time to   
 change the stock, the limited amount  
 of space in the van and lack of time  
 to ask people what kind of books they 
 would like the library to stock are   
 the main problems of the librarians.  
                                       
 The{post bus}was started in 1984. Very
 few people use it because it is a slow
 method of transport and they have     
 access to a car. Nevertheless it      
 started because there was a need for  
 this kind of service locally and the  
 drivers are convinced of its value. It
 gets rather full at Erwood and Aberedw
 with peoples shopping and push chairs.
