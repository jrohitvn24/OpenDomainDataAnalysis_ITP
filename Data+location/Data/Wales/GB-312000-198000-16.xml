 I have lived in Gilfach for 67 years. 
 School was very different when I was a
 child, we didn't have the same freedom
 or facilities. We could get more for  
 our pounds shillings and pence. We    
 could go to the cinema for 2d. and    
 sweets 1d. for a large bag. Shoes cost
 5sh. a pair. The village was very     
 different e.g. The Welfare near the   
 school used to be a quarry - there was
 a coal level up behind the school and 
 the trams used to come down past the  
 school, drawn by horses, right down to
 the railway where the coal was loaded 
 onto trucks. There was no main road to
 cross then, the new road from Ystrad  
 Mynach to Bargoed had not been built  
 and the land between Pengam and       
 Gilfach was mainly wooded. "Charity   
 Wood" it was called. Life was a lot   
 slower in those days.                 </content>
