    Clyne is a{small community,}yet    
 where houses and terraces do exist    
 they are quite densely situated. The  
 first housing you come to is a terrace
 on one side of the road. It is near a 
{railway bridge,}and is called Cyd     
 Terrace. The rear gardens of the      
 houses back onto small fields and also
 woodland.                             
    The village is on the side of the  
{B4434}road;it did have an old{tinworks
 at one time,but that was closed in    
{1940.  The River Neath}flows below the
 village on the floor of the valley,as 
 does the{Vale of Neath Canal.         
    At one point near the village,the  
 canal crossed the River Neath by means
 of an{Aqueduct.}However,most of this  
 was carried away in a flood and the   
 water is now piped across the river.
