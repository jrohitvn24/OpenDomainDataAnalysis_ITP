		<title>16Milk quotas</title>
		<content> This is a subject on every farmers    
 lips.In 1984 due to overproduction of 
 milk farmers have been asked to cut   
 their milk supplies. Prices have      
 slumped and borrowings are under      
 pressure from high interst rates. The 
 decision was made by the EEC and it   
 was thought a period of adjustment    
 would be allowed but according to the 
 farmer it seemed to have been         
 implemented overnight. To overcome the
 difficulty farmers will be forced     
 to either cut milk yields per cow or  
 reduce herd numbers.                  
 A combination of both possibly.
