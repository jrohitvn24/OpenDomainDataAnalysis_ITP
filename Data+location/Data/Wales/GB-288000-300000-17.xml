		<content> There isn't a policeman who lives in  
 our village today but we used to have 
 one.Our nearest police station is at  
 Caersws twelve miles away.A policeman 
 comes to our village twice a week for 
 an hour.Sometimes in our school a     
 policeman comes to tell us about the  
 Green Cross Code and warns us of other
 dangers.Sometimes a patrol car passes 
 through our village on a routine      
 journey or if you dial 999 it will be 
 the first one there.The patrol car    
 doesn't pass through our village very 
 often only on an emergency. If you do 
 something wrong a policeman will take 
 you to the {Magistrates Court }at {   
{Machynlleth }which is held on the     
 first Wednesday of every month.More   
 serious cases are tried at the {Crown 
{Court }which is held at {Welshpool.}  
                                       
                                       </content>
