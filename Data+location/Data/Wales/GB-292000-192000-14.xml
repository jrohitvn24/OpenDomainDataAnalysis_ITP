		<title>14THE BERWYN CENTRE</title>
		<content> THE WORKMEN'S HALL WAS BUILT IN       
 NANTYMOEL IN 1901 WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS  
 BY THE WORKMEN.  IT CATERED FOR MINERS
 AND THEIR FAMILIES IN EVERY FORM OF   
 SOCIAL ACTIVITY.  IN 1931 THERE WAS   
 THE OPENING OF THE "TALKIES", WHICH   
 BECAME THE NEW MAIN SOURCE OF         
 ENTERTAINMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS.       
 LATER, IN 1952, IT WAS CHANGED TO THE 
 BERWYN CENTRE, WITH ALTERATIONS       
 INSIDE AND OUT.  THERE WAS A WORKMAN'S
 ACCIDENT FUND MADE UP TO PAY FOR THIS 
 BUILDING.                             
          WHEN ALTERATIONS FINALLY     
 ENDED, THE COMMITEE THROUGH OUT THE   
 YEARS AND IN LATER DAYS, ALSO LOOKED  
 AFTER THE CULTURAL SIDE, WITH AN      
 EXTENSIVE LIBRARY, READING ROOMS,     
 DRAMA WEEKS, AND ART COUNCIL PLAYS.   
          THE BERWYN CENTRE STILL PLAYS
 A MAJOR PART IN THE COMMUNITY LIFE OF 
 THE OGMORE VALLEY.                    </content>
