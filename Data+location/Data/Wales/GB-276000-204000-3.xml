		<content>      The major industry in the area   
 around Crynant has been coal mining.  
 At the present time there are two     
 drift mines in operation, Blaenant    
 Colliery and Treforgan Colliery.      
      Blaenant Colliery is             
 approximately one mile south of       
 Crynant and adjacent to the former    
 Cefn Coed Colliery which is now a     
 'Coal and Steam Museum'.              
      Treforgan Colliery is situated in
 the village itself and commenced      
 production in May 1966 to exploit 3   
 million tons of Anthracite reserves in
 the Red Vein Seam. At present, 227 men
 are employed in the driving and       
 servicing of 3 development drifts on a
 4-shift pattern.                      
      In July 1985, Treforgan Colliery 
 became one of the pits scheduled to be
 closed on uneconomical grounds by the 
 National Coal Board.                  </content>
