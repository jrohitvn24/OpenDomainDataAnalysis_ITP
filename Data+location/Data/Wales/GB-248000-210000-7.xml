		<title>07General Description (Cont)</title>
		<content> The religion of the area is strongly  
 non_conformist in character.It        
 contains 7 non_conformist chapels but 
 only 2 Anglican churches and only one 
 Roman Catholic church.Recently,however
 ,a sect of the Jehovah Witnesses has  
 developed strongly in the area.       
  Of historical intrest is the chapel  
 known as "{HEN SOAR}"(Old Soar).Built 
 in 1834,it was the first Methodist    
 chapel in Pontyberem and the close    
 connection between the Methodists and 
 Anglicans is illustrated by the fact  
 that Hen Soar possesses a belfrey-more
 commonly found in churches.Of some    
 historical interest also is {Mynachlog
{Terrace}in block{D7.}The Welsh word   
 "Mynachlog"means monastery and the    
 terrace,built in 1875,has,so local    
 tradition has it,been built on land   
 belonging to a local monastery.There  
 is also a" {Mynachlog Farm}" (see p.8)</content>
