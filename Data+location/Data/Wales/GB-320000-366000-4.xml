		<content>  Most of the children in my class play
 games of all sorts. In our free time  
 we found that{computer games}were the 
 most popular. Several children are    
 keen collectors i.e. stamps, coins and
 dolls are the most popular in our     
 class. We spend our{leisure time}in   
 different places; girls have ballet   
 lessons, some boys do Karate and Judo.
 Some of the girls have started bowling
 which is growing in popularity with   
 all ages in the village. Gardening was
 the least popular with us but many do 
 spend weekends out ending in having a 
 "bar snack" and a soft drink in a pub.
 Some of us spend a weekend in a hotel 
 and several have days out at Rhyl and 
 go shopping in Mold and Chester. Some 
 children go to Theatre Clwyd and one  
 or two even have Drama lessons on a   
 Saturday morning.
