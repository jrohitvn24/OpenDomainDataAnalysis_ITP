		<title>13The Old Church on the marsh</title>
		<content> Ref. 0258502031                       
 The old Parish Church of Llandeilo    
 Talybont (yr Hen Eglwys) is positioned
 on the eastern bank of the{river      
{Loughor}at a point where there was    
 once a well known ford dating from    
 Roman times.                          
 The oldest visible parts of this      
 ancient edifice dates back to the     
 12th. century. It has remained in its 
 present form since the 14th. century. 
 It seems probable that the Old Church 
 was a simple, rectangular building    
 originally, a late example of an early
 Celtic Church.                        
 Due to vandalism, the parish has      
 donated the building to the National  
 Folk Museum of Wales, who are in the  
 process of removing it stone by stone,
 and who will in the future re-erect   
 it at St. Fagans, Cardiff.
