		<title>16LAW AND ORDER IN PENCOED</title>
		<content>      To-day policemen have to study   
 the law and are taught many skills.   
 They are taught first aid, rescue and 
 how to defend themselves.             
      Part of a policeman's job is to  
 teach people how to prevent accidents 
 and crime. They visit schools and     
 teach children road safety, crime     
 prevention and talk about police work.
      In our town we have three        
 community policemen who are           
 responsible for law and order. They   
 get to know the public and give advice
 to organisations of all sorts. They   
 are friendly faces in the town and    
 people respect them. In l984 our      
 community constables won the          
 Shrievalty Cup for being the best team
 in the police authority.              
      Our policemen also take cycling  
 proficiency lessons in our school.
