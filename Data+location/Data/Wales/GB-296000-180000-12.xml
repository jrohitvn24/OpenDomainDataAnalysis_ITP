		<title>12Llanharan Colliery</title>
		<content> Llanharan stands on the Southern      
 outcrop of the{South Wales Coalfield.}
 The first pit was opened in 1870 but  
 was later closed because of difficult 
 geological condtions and flooding.    
 In the early 1920's the{Powell-Dyffryn
{Company}decided to try again by       
 linking  Llanharan Pit to Llantrisant 
 colliery. The Pit was sunk at         
 Llanharan in 1939. In 1942 Llantrisant
 was damaged by an explosion so the    
 link was never made. Powell-Dyffryn   
 tried to link Llanharan mine to       
 disused Meiros mine but this was      
 abandoned because of flooding in the  
 old mine. Llanharan mine was worked   
 until difficult conditions and floods 
 made it uneconomical and it was closed
 in 1962. The old colliery site is now 
 used for washeries and sidings for the
 transportationon of the coal from the 
 near by {opencast}site.               </content>
