		<content> PENTRE IS THE SECOND BIGGEST VILLAGE  
 IN THE AREA,BUT IT IS WHERE OUR SCHOOL
 IS.THE OLDEST HOUSE IS 300 YEARS      
 OLD.THE NEWEST HOUSES ARE ABOUT 10    
 YEARS OLD.OUR SCHOOL IS ABOUT 150     
 YEARS OLD AND WAS ORIGINALLY A        
 CHURCH.4 YEARS AGO THE EDUCATION      
 AUTHORITY WANTED TO CLOSE IT BECAUSE  
 IT ONLY HAS 31 PUPILS,BUT THE PARENTS 
 PROTESTED AND IT WAS KEPT OPEN.PEOPLE 
 LIKE LIVING IN PENTRE,BUT THE TROUBLE 
 IS EVERYONE IS GETTING OLD.THERE ARE  
 ONLY 7 CHILDREN,AND ONLY 2 COME TO    
 PENTRE SCHOOL.BECAUSE THERE ARE SO    
 MANY RETIRED PEOPLE ALL THE GARDENS   
 ARE WELL LOOKED AFTER,BUT AFTER THE   
 SCHOOL SHUTS EACH DAY,EVERYTHING IS   
 DEAD QUIET.EVEN THE 2 CHILDREN WHO    
 COME TO PENTRE SCHOOL OFTEN GO TO STAY
 WITH THEIR NAN BECAUSE THEIR MUM WORKS
 NIGHTS AT CHIRK HOSPITAL.
