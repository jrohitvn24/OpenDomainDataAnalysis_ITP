		<title>05RHUALLT POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content> The present owner took over in 1975,  
 the property being a shop/post office.
  Until approximately 1968 local post  
 was deposited at the post office and  
 was then delivered, with the papers,  
 by the sub-postmaster/owner. Remaining
 mail for outlying areas (A 20 mile    
 round trip.) was taken by the regular 
 postmen, together with some papers.   
 This latter arrangement continues,to a
 certain extent,today. There are two   
 collections of mail a day (Mon_Fri) at
 11.30am and 4.25pm.Saturday collection
 is at 11.30am.                        
  The stock limit of Â£15 of stamps, Â£50
 of postal orders and Â£5 of National   
 Insurance stamps, imposed at the time 
 the present owner took over, has been 
 lifted allowing expansion in trade.   
 Business in Natonal Giro and National 
 Savings has developed well from about 
 1978.                                 </content>
