		<title>16An 8 year old girl's day. p1</title>
		<content> Every day except at weekends I get up 
 around 7 o'clock. I get dressed before
 I go down to breakfast. We have a     
 choice of three or four cereals or    
 toast. When I have finished breakfast 
 I wash my teeth and brush my hair. At 
 half past eight Nia's mother comes    
 down and picks me up to take me to    
 school. Before school starts we have  
 assembly. We do maths first then      
 either reading or English. At quarter 
 to eleven we have playtime except on  
 Tuesdays when we have it at twenty to 
 eleven because we have a television   
 programme called Watch.               
 We have dinner at 12 o'clock, you can 
 either bring a packed lunch or have   
 dinners, it costs 60p a meal. After   
 dinner we have Welsh and the Top      
 Infants come into our class to make   
 room for the Nursery class which is   
 the four year olds.                   </content>
