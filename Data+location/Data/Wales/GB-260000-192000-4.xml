		<content> Although the area is predominantly    
 English speaking, some Welsh customs  
 still prevail,e.g. the celebration of 
 St. David's Day. On March 1, little   
 girls dress traditional Welsh         
 costumes. Schools hold Eisteddfodau or
 concerts where children compete       
 against each other in music,recitation
 and dance. Schools close for half a   
 day to celebrate the saint's day.     
 In Singleton Park, there is a Gorsedd 
 circle, which is a circle of very     
 large stones. This is used for the    
 ceremony to proclaim the National     
 Eisteddfod in the year before it is   
 held. It is also used during          
 Eisteddfod week when new members are  
 accepted into the Gorsedd. The        
 National Eisteddfod has been held in  
 Swansea on three occasions, most      
 recently in 1982.
