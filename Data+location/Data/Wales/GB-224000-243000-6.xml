		<content>  Near Llwyndyry there is a historic   
 mound which is marked Tumulus on the  
 Ordance Survey Map but according to   
 Sir John Lynn thomas' researh was the 
 site of the headquarters of a Welsh   
 chieftain who entertained Pwyll       
 Pendefig Dyfed on his famous historic 
 hunt from Arberth to Glyn Cuch when he
 stayed at Llwyn Dirawyd (Llwyndyrys)  
 as recalled in the Mabinogion.  It is 
 also believed that the Battle of      
 Llechryd 1087 took place at Llwyndyrys
 when Rhys ap Tewdwr gained a victory. 
 it was owned by the Bishops of St     
 David's until 1800 when it was sold to
 Rev T Griffiths under an act of       
 parliament for the redemption of land 
 tax.  The Mansion eventually became a 
 hotel.  The present owner mrs N Sear  
 runs it a a hotel during the summer   
 months but in the winter more emphasis
 is placd on the functions side.       </content>
