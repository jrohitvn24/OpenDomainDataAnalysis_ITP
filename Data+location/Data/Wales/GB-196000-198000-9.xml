		<title>09PEMBROKE POWER STATION</title>
		<content>{Pembroke Power Station}is outside the 
 grid that we have studied,but it has  
 many implications for our area.       
  It is one of the reasons for the     
 large traffic flow through{Pembroke,  
{Monkton}and{Hundleton.                
  The station contributes to the       
 National Grid through a system of high
 pylons supporting overhead power      
 lines.These pylons are very prominent 
 features and pass right through the   
 area we have studied.                 
  Britain's population is increasing   
 more rapidly in the south and there is
 an increasing demand for electricity  
 in that area.The answer has been to   
 build coalburning stations close to   
 coalfields and oilburning stations    
 close to their source of fuel.The     
 electricity is then carried south by  
 the overhead transmission lines.
