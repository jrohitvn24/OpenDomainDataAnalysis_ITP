		<content>    Alongside the north-western        
 boundary of Beguildy School is the    
 Beguildy Telephone Exchange which was 
 modernised in 1979 to cope with the   
 increasing number of subscribers in   
 the Beguildy area. Every number on the
 Beguildy exchange is a three-figure   
 number beginning with the figure 2 or 
 the figure 6. There are 152           
 subscribers on the Beguildy exchange. 
 There are five lines to Knighton so   
 five different people can ring        
 Knighton from Beguildy at the same    
 time. Sixteen people on the Beguildy  
 exchange can speak to each other at   
 the same time. In a power failure all 
 the telephones are automatically      
 switched to batteries in the exchange.
 All calls made by Beguildy subscribers
 are metered at the exchange.          
    Mail is delivered up the valley    
 once a day and collected twice.       </content>
