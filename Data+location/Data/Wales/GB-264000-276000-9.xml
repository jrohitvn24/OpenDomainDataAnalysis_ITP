		<content> The majority of the farming families  
 are Welsh speaking with Weslh as their
 first language. Amongst the 2         
 communities there are a fair number of
 English people &amp; Welsh people with    
 English as their first/only language. 
 Probably 70-75% are{totally Welsh     
 speaking. Most of the activities in   
 the Capel Seion area are in Welsh as  
 are all the chapel activities.        
 Llanfihangel tend to be more          
 bi-lingual &amp; church services there    
 alternate weekly between Welsh &amp;      
 English. Llanfihangel have their own  
 village primary school which teaches  
 in both languages with a preferance to
 Welsh as do most Welsh primary schools
 Most village activities are organised 
 by the school. At eleven years old    
 children go to either the Welsh or the
 English Comprehensive schools in      
 Aberystwyth.                          </content>
