		<title>12TRANSPORT IN WELSHPOOL</title>
		<content> Welshpool lies at the junction of the 
 main north-south Wales route, the     
{A 490,}and the main route between the 
 Midlands and the coastal resorts of   
 the Lleyn Peninsula, the{A 458.}This  
 latter route leads to much congestion 
 in the summer and many people feel    
 that a by-pass is urgently required.  
{Bus services}are run mainly by        
 Crosville linking the town with       
 Newtown, Oswestry, Shrewsbury,        
 Llanidloes and Llanfair Caereinion. A 
 local service runs between the major  
 housing estates and the town centre.  
 The "Traws Cymru" (Across Wales) route
 between Liverpool and Cardiff runs    
 twice weekly through the town.        
{Welshpool railway station}lies on the 
 Cambrian Line between Shrewsbury and  
 Aberystwyth. About 17 trains run daily
 through the town. These are passenger 
 trains with only a few freight trains.</content>
