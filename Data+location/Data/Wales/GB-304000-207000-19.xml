		<title>19ST. Aloysius Catholic Church</title>
		<content> My name is Terence Pippin.            
 I go to St.Aloysius School.It is a    
 catholic school.Nearby is our church. 
 It is a modern building with large    
 windows,it is very pretty.There are   
 gardens around the church.The parish  
 priest is Father Pierce Maher who is  
 Irish and has been in charge of the   
 church since it opened in 1977.There  
 is a house attached to the church for 
 the priest.The church is built from   
 yellow bricks and is one of the nicest
 buidings in the area.                 
  I am writing about 16th.June 1985.On 
 this day we celebrated the feast of   
 Corpus Christi a very important day in
 the catholic church.I took part in a  
 large procession through the town.It  
 was really warm and I was glad to     
 change back into my old clothes. Back 
 at home my parents were decorating so 
 I helped them scrape the walls.       </content>
