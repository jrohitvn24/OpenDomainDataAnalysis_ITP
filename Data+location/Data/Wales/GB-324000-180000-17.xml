		<title>17EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> The two main employers in Marshfield  
 are Ansell's Brewery and the Unigate  
 Dairy. Most people travel to Cardiff  
 or Newport to work.There is a village 
 blacksmith but occupations such as    
 thatcher, saddler and bootmaker have  
 disappeared.                          
 Some occupations such as cattle hauler
 and agricultural builder are connected
 with the land but most of the people  
 in our area are not employed on the   
 land. They work in Hospitals, shops   
 steelworks, factories, offices and    
 public houses.Most Mothers work in the
 house, but some have part-time jobs in
 local pubs or shops.Unemployment is   
 quite high in our area.               
 Most men work 8 hours a day,except the
 farmers,who work up to 16 hours       
  a day in the Summer.
