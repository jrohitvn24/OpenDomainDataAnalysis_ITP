 Govilon School visited Llanwenarth    
 House,which was built in 1550,in the  
 village of Govilon.The main part of   
 the house is made out of stone and    
 slate,with bricks over the doors and  
 window.There are three floors.On the  
 first floor there are 11 rooms.The    
 window frames in the kitchen are made 
 out of stone mullion.On the next floor
 there are 14 rooms.One of the rooms   
 was a bacon room used for curing meat.
 In one of the bedrooms is a fireplace 
 dating from 1600.The large garden     
 contains a walled orchard.The famous  
 Welsh family of Morgon built the house
 some 400 years ago and their family   
 lived there until about 1953.
