		<content>      The main religion of this area   
 is Chapel or Church of England.       
      Moriah is the only Chapel found  
 in this block.  Moriah was originally 
 built in 1827 and was rebuilt in 1865.
 Moriah is Baptist.  There is a        
 minister and the services are held at 
 10.30 a.m. (Morning Service), 11.30   
 a.m. (Sunday School) and 6.00 p.m.    
 (Evening Service).  The services are  
 held in Welsh because Welsh is the    
 first language of the area.  The      
 Baptism is carried out under the old  
 hand worked water pump.               
      The cemetary is in the grounds of
 Moriah.  Some of the grave stones are 
 nearly as old as the chapel.          
      Other denominations have to      
 commute to (Carmarthen) or large      
 village.
