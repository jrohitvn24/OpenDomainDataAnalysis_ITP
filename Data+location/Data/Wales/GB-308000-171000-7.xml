 The largest and most visited botanic  
 garden in Wales, Dyffryn, comprises 30
 hectares of landscaped gardens,       
 containing 6000 different kinds of    
 plants. It has much to offer members  
 of the general public and is easily   
 reached from the M4 motorway.         
 Horticulturally, it is favoured by    
 soil conditions and its proximity to  
 the sea. There are 8 large glasshouses
 with orchids, gesneriads and succulent
 plants. Two contain impressive        
 displays of pot-plants. The Tropical  
 Palm House exhibits include           
 tropical,sub-tropical,exotic and      
 economic plants. Dyffryn Gardens are  
 of exceptional interest to the        
 horticulturist, with many Far Eastern 
 botanical treasures. The collection of
 rare trees includes specimens, the    
 finest of their kind in Britain.      </content>
