		<title>15THE BADGE FACTORY</title>
		<content> TOYE, KENNING AND SPENCER PRODUCE A   
 LARGE AND ASSORTED RANGE OF PRODUCTS. 
 THESE INCLUDE TROPHIES, BADGES AND    
 CUFFLINKS.  CASTING AND ENGRAVING IS  
 ALSO PERFORMED THERE.  METALS AND     
 TEXTILES ARE TWO ASPECTS OF THEIR     
 BUSINESS.                             
        THE FACTORY WAS ORIGINALLY A   
 STABLE.  HORSES BELONGING TO THE      
 N.C.B. WERE KEPT THERE.  LATER WHEN   
 HORSES NO LONGER WENT UNDERGROUND IN  
 THE COAL MINES, THE STABLE WAS        
 CONVERTED INTO A TRAINING CENTRE FOR  
 APPRENTICES WISHING TO WORK IN THE    
 COAL MINES.                           
           THE TOYE FAMILY HAD COME    
 SEEKING REFUGE IN BRITAIN FROM        
 RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN FRANCE IN    
 1685.  TOYE, KENNING AND SPENCER WERE 
 LATER FOUNDED. THE TRAINING CENTRE    
 WAS THEN CONVERTED AND EXTENDED INTO  
 TODAYS FACTORY WHICH EMPLOYS 44 PEOPLE</content>
