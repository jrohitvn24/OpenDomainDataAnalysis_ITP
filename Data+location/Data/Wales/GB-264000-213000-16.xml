		<title>16The Black Mountain.</title>
		<content>    North of the village of Glanaman   
 lies the Black Mountain, a range of   
 hills which form the westerly extent  
 of the Brecon Beacons National Park.  
    The mountain provides excellent    
 walking country, being crisscrossed by
 many unfenced roads and footpaths. The
 flora consists mainly of grasses,     
 sedges and heathers, although many    
 interesting plants, such as the sundew
 and butterwort are to be found.       
    Weather conditions can be extreme. 
 Consequently, the hills are mainly    
 used for the summer grazing of sheep. 
    Recently, attempts have been made  
 to sell off hundred-acre parcels of   
 the Black Mountain to private owners, 
 who would be bound by the regulations 
 of the National Park Authority. Local 
 feeling has been divided on this      
 issue, as large tracts of land may be 
 bought up by foreign concerns.        </content>
