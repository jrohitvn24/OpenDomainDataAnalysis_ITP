		<content> company anymore, and the last of its  
 works in the area at Greenfield is    
 just closing down. A local mayor has  
 said that the people of Flint should  
 be allowed to demolish the works      
 because of the effects of Courtaulds  
 pulling out of the area.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
 Some small industries have taken      
 Courtaulds' place in Flint. Some of   
 the land the works were on is         
 derelict. Many people in Flint are    
 unemployed. Flint has ceased to be an 
 industrial area it is now more of a   
 dormitory town.
