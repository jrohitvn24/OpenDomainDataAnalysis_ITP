		<title>19PORTHMADOG BALLAST ISLAND</title>
		<content> During the 19th century Porthmadog was
 an important slate-exporting centre.  
 From here slate was sent to Germany   
 and the Baltic.On their return the    
 ships often sailed in ballast.        
 Originally this was dumped near the   
 harbour but in 1862 this site was     
 levelled at 18feet above low water and
 a new dumping ground had to be found. 
 A sandy site east of the Glaslyn was  
 chosen and an island gradually        
 developed.Later a quay was constructed
 where the ballast was unloaded and a  
 small travelling crane was used to    
 transfer ballast to small trucks.These
 were man-handled along a track to the 
 end of the island.A house for the     
 crane-driver and his family was built.
 Stones from many parts of the world   
 can be found on Ballast Island as well
 as rare plants and flowers which have 
 grown from seeds brought on the stones</content>
