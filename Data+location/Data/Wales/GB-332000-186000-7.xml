		<title>07RADIO HARTRIDGE. NEWPORT.</title>
		<content>    {Radio Hartridge}is the internal   
 broadcasting system of Hartridge      
 Comprehensive School. The first       
 programme has already been taped with 
 the help of some of our fourth year   
 pupils and is introduced by our own   
 station identity jingle. This has been
 professionally produced for us.       
     Our programmes will be broadcast  
 on a Thursday morning between 9.10 and
 9.20. We hope to include interviews,  
 music,sports fixtures,meetings,a      
 magazine of the air,announcements, and
 perhaps a quiz. We hope that every    
 pupil in the school will be given the 
 opportunity to take part and also hope
 that it could form part of a school   
 course.                               
     Evenually we think that interested
 pupils will become part of the team.  
 and will run the station without too  
 much help from teachers.              </content>
