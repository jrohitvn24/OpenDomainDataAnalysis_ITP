		<title>11Ty'n y Wern Farm.</title>
		<content>       Ty'n y Wern is a livestock farm 
 of some 100 acres which is intensively
 farmed and carries a breeding flock of
 450 sheep and a herd of 20 beef -     
 breeding cows.                        
       Improved grazings and grass     
 crops of hay and silage has allowed   
 10% of land to be released to arable  
 purposes, mainly swedes and potatoes  
 which are sown on a rotational basis. 
      The sheep flock is part-wintered 
 in Dyfed returning to be winter housed
 in February and lambing indoors in    
 early March. With the exception of ewe
 lamb flock replacements and some 5% of
 male lambs retained as rams, all lambs
 are sold fat, being taken directly to 
 the 'Welsh Quality Lamb' abbatoir at  
 Builth Wells.                         
      The old stone built farm house   
 has been replaced by a modern, central
 heated four bedroomed farm house.     </content>
