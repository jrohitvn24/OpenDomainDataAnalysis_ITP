 SIDES, HAVE BEEN FORMED TO REVIVE THE 
 OLD DANCES. MORRIS MYNYDD DDU WAS     
 FORMED IN APRIL 1980 AND INCLUDED     
 THREE PEOPLE FROM VELINDRE. MEMBERS

 THE SUMMER, AT WEEKENDS AND ON BANK   
 HOLIDAYS, THEY TRAVEL AROUND POWYS AND
 SOMETIMES FURTHER AFIELD TO GIVE DANCE

 PERFORM INCLUDE COTSWOLD, NORTHWEST,  
 CLOG, LICHFIELD BORDER, STOVE AND
