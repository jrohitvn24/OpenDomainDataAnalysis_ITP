		<content> Between 1980 - 1984 visitor figures   
 increased from 100,000 - 250,000.     
 A survey of visitors was undertaken.  
 A total of 849 people in 173 groups   
 were interviewed.                     
 Nearly three quarters (75%) of        
 visitor groups to Margam are on day   
 trips.                                
 Over half of all groups consist of    
 married people with children (64%).   
 The average group size is four        
 persons.                              
 The majority of all groups live in or 
 are staying in, Mid or West Glamorgan.
 Nearly half (48%) of tourist groups   
 come from London and the South east.  
 Only 6% of tourist groups come from   
 Wales.
