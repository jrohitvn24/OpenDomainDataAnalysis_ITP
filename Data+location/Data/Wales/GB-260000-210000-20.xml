		<title>20LAW AND ORDER IN AMMANFORD 2</title>
		<content>  They allow the Scouts and Brownies   
 etc. to look around the Police Station
 when they are shown the cells,        
 fingerprints room etc.                
  Over the last 12 years there have    
 been 5 murders in the Ammanford       
 district. There are, on average, 20   
 suicides a year. If a serious incident
 occurs 2 Police dogs can be called    
 upon and if there is a search for     
 drugs there is a dog specially trained
 for the job.                          
  The local Police are worried about   
 the mis-use of drugs in the area. As  
 one man said "Yesterday in New York,  
 today in London, don't let it happen  
 tomorrow in Ammanford".               
  This information was given in an     
 interview with the duty inspector.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
