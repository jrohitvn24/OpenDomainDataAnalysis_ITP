		<title>01     OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Our area consists of the village of   
 Swyddffynnon and includes part of     
 the famous nature reserve _ "Cors     
 Caron," visited by hundreds of        
 naturalists from all over the globe   
 annually.Swyddffynnon itself is a     
 small,rural village,comprising of 24  
 houses.We have the local primary      
 school based here.Swyddffynnon got    
 its name from the Cistercian monks    
 based at Strata Florida Abbey,4 miles 
 away,during the twelfth century.SWYDD 
 stands for OFFICE, and FFYNNON for    
 WELL.According to legend the monks    
 used to have an office by the well in 
 the village. The area itself is       
 sparsely populated,comprising of      
 farms and under nourished land.       
 Agriculture is the main form of       
 employment,and sheep together with    
 cattle the main source of income.The  
 river Camddwr runs through the village</content>
