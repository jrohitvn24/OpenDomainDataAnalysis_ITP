		<content>   I'm Joanne Merchant, I am 13, and I 
 have just moved to{Bishopston}from    
 where I used to live in{Port Talbot.  
{Bishopston}is a largish village in    
{South Gower,}on the South coast of    
{Wales,}it has not much to do sometimes
 especially in the nights when not much
 goes on. In school we have different  
 subjects including Maths, English,    
 History, Geography, Sciences etc. I   
 have a few lessons I like best:       
 English, Biology and maybe Welsh.     
 School is quite big and I am in 2B, we
 (girls) play hockey, the reason?      
 because we have to!                   
  {Bishopston}is mainly boring even    
 though it has nice surroundings, the  
 school has a Youth Club every         
 Wednesday but it is mostly the older  
 pupils that go.
