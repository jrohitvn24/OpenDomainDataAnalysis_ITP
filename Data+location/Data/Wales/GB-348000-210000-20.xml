		<content>{CommunITel}is a system designed to    
 implement a{Prestel}type local        
 viewdata system. A host system has    
 been set up at{Monmouth Comprehensive 
{School}and a local system at{Mitchel  
{Troy Primary School.                  
 The children of both schools have     
 created their own viewdata magazines  
 called{MonITel and Troytel.}At Mitchel
 Troy the magazine is broadcast in the 
 dining room during mealtimes using a  
 carousel option. The children are able
 to send and receive messages down the 
 phone lines using a modem connected to
 their computers. A{Telepal}system has 
 been devised where children from the  
 Primary School correspond with        
 children at the Comprehensive School. 
 It is hoped that more schools will    
 join in the scheme in the future.
