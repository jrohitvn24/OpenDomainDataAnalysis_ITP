		<title>16PROBLEMS OF THE YOUNG 2</title>
		<content> The nearsest form of nightlife is to  
 be found over 6 miles away in the city
 of Cardiff. With Cardiff being such a 
 large and active city the             
 entertainment available can often turn
 out to be rather expensive. Young     
 people, who are often living on very  
 low wages, find it very hard to       
 justify the expense of an evening out,
 so for most of the time they either   
 wander about the streets or sit at    
 home and vegitate.                    
 Unless something can be done to       
 improve the area, in both an          
 industrial and social sense Taffs Well
 could well become a ghost town.       
 All in all, the area presents an      
 unhappy enviroment for young people in
 the 1980's.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
