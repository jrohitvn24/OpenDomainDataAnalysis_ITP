 Sunday afternoon to end the Deeside

 lot of charity stalls where you can   
 find good bargains and a few gambling 
 stalls such as raffles and tombola.   
 There is a small fair containing an   
 arcade, roundabouts, swinging chairs &amp;
 a bouncing castle, as well as stalls  
 where you can win a goldfish or rubber

 where you can relax with a soft drink.
