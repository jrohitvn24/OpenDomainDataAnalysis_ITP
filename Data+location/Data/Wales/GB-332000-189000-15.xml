		<content> On Tuesday in assembly we have hymn   
 practice. Then reading groups are     
 called I am in reading group A. When I
 have finshed my work I play with      
 something or read a book. Then we go  
 out to play. When we come in we have  
 dinner and then go to play. When we   
 come in we have register &amp; finish our 
 work. Then its time for tables. Then  
 we go back to our class to wait for   
 the bell to go. Then Mrs Thomas tell  
 us to put our coats on and line up.   
 Then we go out of school to our Mums. 
 Then we pick up my brother and go to  
 library. It takes a long time to      
 choose a book. Then we go home and I  
 watch my programmes. Then Dad comes   
 home from work I have a game of pool  
 with him. He usually wins. Then I have
 tea and watch T.V. with Mummy Daddy   
 and Adam. Then we get ready for bed,  
 Adam goes first, I go an hour after.  </content>
