 The hospital is situated on the       
 outskirts of the town. The original   
 building was an Ironmaster's house    
 until the conversion in 1917. It has 5
 wards:'A' Ward (Gynaecology) has 20   
 beds;the Hann Ward (Geriatric) has 20 
 beds;'C' Ward (Orthopaedic) has 20    
 beds;the Kensole Ward (Children's) has
 25 beds; and the Maternity Unit which 
 has 35 beds. The A,C and Hann Wards'  
 main drawback is the lack of a        
 dayroom. There is also an operating   
 theatre Unit, Day Unit for the Elderly
 and a Casualty Department. During 1985
 it is hoped that cardiac arrest       
 equipment can be purchased. The       
 hospital provides a much needed       
 service for the community and every   
 patient we spoke to praised the staff 
 for the care and attention they       
 provide.                              </content>
