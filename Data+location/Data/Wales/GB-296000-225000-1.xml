		<title>01LIBANUS VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   LIBANUS USED TO BE TWO HAMLETS ; THE
 NORTHERLY ONE WAS CALLED TAI'R BULL   
 AND THE SOUTHERN WAS LIBANUS BUT BEING
 SO CLOSE TOGETHER, ABOUT HALF A MILE  
 DISTANT, THEY WERE TURNED INTO ONE    
 VILLAGE CALLED LIBANUS. LIBANUS IS THE
 ONLY VILLAGE IN WALES THAT TAKES IT'S 
 NAME FROM IT'S CHAPEL WITH OTHER      
 PLACES IT'S THE OPPOSITE WAY AROUND.  
 THE POPULATION OF THE VILLAGE HAS     
 GROWN SINCE 1984 WHEN THE COUNCIL     
 BUILT NEW HOUSES, PEOPLE ARE          
 RENOVATING SOME OLD ONES, THEY ARE    
 ALSO LAYING NEW FOUNDATIONS FOR THIRTY
 SIX MORE HOUSES. THE AREA AROUND      
 LIBANUS IS CALLED THE BRECON BEACONS  
 AND IS LOOKED AFTER BY THE NATIONAL   
 PARKS.THE TWO MAIN OCCUPATIONS IN THIS
 AREA ARE FARMING AND TOURISM. THE     
 AMENITIES OF THE VILLAGE ARE THE      
 PRIMARY SHCOOL THE CHURCH, THE CHAPEL 
 THE POST OFFICE, AND THERE ARE BUSES. </content>
