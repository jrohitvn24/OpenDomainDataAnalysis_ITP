		<title>17The Llandudno Lifeboat.</title>
		<content>  The{first Lifeboat Station,}dating   
 from 1864, was built by the railway   
 station. In an emergency the boat (a  
 rowing boat) could be transported     
 elsewhere, e.g. Conwy or Colwyn Bay,  
 by train. {The second station}was     
 built in 1902 in the centre of town,  
 nextdoor to our school. {Why was it   
{built away from the beach?}The reason 
 is that it is equidistant from the two
 main beaches, the North Shore and the 
 West Shore.  It is rectangular in     
 shape and an extension was added to it
 in 1982. It accomodates both the main 
 lifeboat and the inflatable in-shore  
 rescue craft.                         
  The{present lifeboat}was built in    
 1963 at a cost of Â£28,000.  Coloured  
 white, red and blue, it is named{The  
{Lilly Wainwright}and bears the number 
 37.09. {(Continued on Page 18).
