		<content> Old village of Cil-y-Cwm was known as 
 Glan-dwr. it was situated in Cae Mawr,
 behind the smithy, and was burned down
 during Great Plague. A disused drovers
 pound may still be seen on outskirts  
 of village. In main street, there is a
 wide gutter which was filld with      
 butter milk for the geese being driven
 to market in Englnd. It would appear  
 that Cil-y-cwm was once virtually self
 sufficient community. Within living   
 memory, th village had 1              
 tailor,2 cobblers, 1 shoemaker, 1     
 blacksmith, 2 general stores (1 with  
 post office) 2 dressmaekrs (1         
 travelling from farm to farm) 1       
 huckster, 1 cattle dealer, 1 woollen  
 factory, 1 flour mill, 2 carpenters.  
 The older people also remember a brass
 band and 2 football teams in the      
 village.
