		<title>12COMMUNITY FARM, CWMBRAN</title>
		<content>    Greenmeadow Community Farm is      
 situated in the middle of an          
 industrial area. The land off Ty Gwyn 
 Way, above the Springvale Industrial  
 Estate consists of almost 85 acres of 
 grazing, arable and woodland.  The    
 concept of the farm is to conserve a  
 green area amid housing estates and   
 factory complexes.                    
    The farm and livestock is in the   
 hands of the farm process manager,    
 John Harrison.  Many volunteers help  
 in the smooth running of the complex; 
 John's wife, for instance, is one of  
 the team which looks after the cafe.  
    About two and a half years ago,when
 the farm was taken over by the present
 work-force, the farmhouse,            
 out-buildings and land were in a      
 delapidated state.  Much hard work and
 finances have transformed the place to
 its present state.                    </content>
