		<title>13TAF FECHAN WATER BOARD 2</title>
		<content> Down the corridor is a chemical room  
 which has in it two tanks containing  
 lime.A little further down the        
 corridor is a purifying drum which    
 cleans the water with a metal fabric  
 mesh.All the dead leaves and dirt gets
 trapped in the mesh and the clean     
 water comes out of the bottem.Ifthe   
 drum gets clogged with dirt the small 
 sprays on top of the drum unclog      
 it.Outside there is an overflow which 
 stopped the reservoir from flooding.  
 The water board is an important       
 employer in the village of Pontsti_   
 cill.Many of the village people either
 work in the filter houes or travel    
 from the village to do repair work on 
 the surrounding roads.In winter the   
 villagers are fortunate that the roads
 are kept free of snow because the     
 water board has to keep the roads     
 open.                                 </content>
