		<title>10Recreation in Bwlchysarnau</title>
		<content> Different groups have been formed over
 the years to provide loac recreational
 facilities based on the church and the
 school. The oldest of these is the    
 Womens Institute formed in 1951 and   
 still meeting monthly at the school to
 educate and entertain its members.Over
 the years it has donated various      
 things such as a water heater and     
 a sign for the church.                
   In recent years a youth group and a 
 Mothers and Toddler's group have been 
 started at the church by local        
 volunteers, filling a need for        
 somewhere to meet. This seems to be   
 very important with the houses being  
 so scattered.                         
   A library van visits Bwlchysarnau   
 once a week from the County Library in
 Llandrindod Wells.
