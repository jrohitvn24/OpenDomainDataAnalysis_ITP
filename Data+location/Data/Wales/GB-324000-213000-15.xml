		<title>15HOME LIFE A SENIOR CITIZEN</title>
		<content> My day begins at 7.10 a.m. when I get 
 up and shower.I then have a cup of tea
 before clearing out my coal fire.I    
 then get a breakfast comprising of    
 cereal and toast.I make sandwiches    
 for my husband's lunch and prepare the
 evening meal which I put in the oven  
 and set the automatic timer.I leave   
 the house at 9.00 a.m. to travel to my
 daughter's house in Llanfoist,some 2  
 miles away.I help her in her General  
 Stores.At 4.00 p.m. my husband picks  
 me up in the car and we return to our 
 home for the main meal of the day.My  
 evenings vary greatly as I am a member
 of the Royal British Legion,Mother's  
 Union and Womens Institute.We go to   
 bed at about 11.30 p.m. with a cup of 
 coffee and a book to read.
