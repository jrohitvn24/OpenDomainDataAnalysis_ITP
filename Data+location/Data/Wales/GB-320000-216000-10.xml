		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> "Hurray I am going swimming at        
 Swansea" I shouted when I woke up at  
{8:30a.m.}and had my breakfast of{three
{weetabix}. I found my swimming trunks 
 at about{8:45a.m.}We jumped in the car
 and went to see Nan who came with us. 
 We drove in the car for about half an 
 hour. Unfortunately the pool was shut 
 for the day and we were all very      
 disappointed at it and Nan suggested  
 to go to Aberavan Lido Pool and we all
 thought that was a good idea so we    
 went to Aberavan which was about 5    
 miles away. We were in the pool for   
 half an hour and went for a walk along
 the pier, took some pictures and      
 walked along the beach looking at     
 shells. Then we went to the fair and  
 had a ride on a few things. Then we   
 went into Swansea to the cinema to    
 see the film called"A View to a       
 Kill"the latest James Bond.           </content>
