 The Welsh Language name for Fishguard 
 is Abergwaun.  It means the mouth of  
 the river Gwaun.                      
  In our school because we don't speak 
 much Welsh we have a special teacher  
 in to help us learn Welsh.            
  In our school only two people speak  
 fluent Welsh they are the Headmaster  
 and a 4 year old boy.                 
  Yesterday six people from Class 4    
 went around Fishguard to do a survey  
 on how many shopkeepers speak Welsh   
 and conduct their business in Welsh.  
  We found that out of the 41          
 shopkeepers we asked, the amount of   
 shopkeepers that speak Welsh was 19.  
 The amount of shopkeepers that conduct
 their business in Welsh was 16.  We   
 thought this was not very many.
