		<title>19Shopping Survey - Findings</title>
		<content> 59 householders provided the following
 information:-                         
 All but 5 shopped in Hereford at least
 occasionally; 12 never shopped in     
 Monmouth; 13 never shopped in Ross; 46
 never shopped in Abergavenny. For     
 shopping at least monthly, Hereford   
 was the most popular town (34),       
 followed by Monmouth (25) and Ross    
 (20). For shopping at least weekly:-  
 Hereford (17), Monmouth (16), Ross    
 (14).                                 
       Only 4 people mentioned daily   
 shopping. Most commonly people went to
 Hereford, Monmouth or Ross weekly or  
 fortnightly, and elsewhere monthly or 
 just occasionally.                    
       Of the other towns, Gloucester  
 received 4 mentions, and Bristol 3.   
 There are clear connections with      
 occupations: those who work in        
 Hereford or Ross tend to shop there.  </content>
