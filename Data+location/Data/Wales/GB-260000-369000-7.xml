		<content>       Something which is important to 
 note is the predominance of Welsh     
 speaking people within the farming    
 area in and around Bangor and in      
 Gwynedd itself.The majority of farmers
 and many people in Gwynedd speak and  
 use Welsh as their first language.The 
 Welsh language has historically       
 developed from a strong agricultural  
 background and has become the primary 
 medium for discussing matters relating
 to the land and the Welsh             
 environment.Indeed there are some     
 words such as "Cynhefin"(in English,  
 meaning niche,homeground,etc) which   
 cannot be adequately translated into  
 English.There are many Welsh          
 expressions and terminologies which   
 enhance the need to retain a knowledge
 of the language since they often refer
 specifically to the character of an   
 agricultural locality.                </content>
