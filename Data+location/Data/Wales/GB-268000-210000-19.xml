		<content> Our village market is near the school 
 and is held in the car park of the    
 Baker's Arms.When it first came the   
 market was quite busy and we asked the
 men who owned the stalls to answer    
 some questions.Most of the stalls were
 busy except for the carpet seller and 
 the pots and pans.One of the busiest  
 were the meat sellers and jewellery   
 stall.In the morning it's not so busy 
 but in the afternoon it's busier.Some 
 of the men are not happy because they 
 don't have many customers but some are
 very busy. The Baker's Arms is near to
 the school so we didn't have far to   
 walk.The best stall was the jewellery 
 stall,the man was very funny.There    
 were many people in our village market
 We have few markets in Ta'rgwaith but 
 we have boot sales. In boot sales they
 sell second-hand things,but in the    
 market they sell jewellery too.       </content>
