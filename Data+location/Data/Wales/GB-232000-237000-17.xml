		<title>17ROCK FORMATION</title>
		<content> The rocks underlying this area belong 
 to the Ordovician system and were laid
 down between 500 and 435 million years
 ago in a sea which was then in        
 existence.The rocks here are mainly   
 mudstones with some bands of sandstone
 Some beds contain small fossils known 
 as graptolites,and these when they    
 occur , help to date the rocks. The   
 graptolites  found indicate the rocks 
 to be near thetop of the Ordovician-in
 beds named the Lower Bala-now renamed 
 the Caradocian.These very old rocks on
 low ground are covered by boulder clay
 formed during the last Ice Age,and was
 then deposited when the ice melted and
 retreated northwards-some 10,000 years
 ago.The clay is found in the form of  
 hummocks or humps, and explains why   
 the roads from Velindre to Pentrecagal
 and from Drefach to Llangeler have so 
 many 'ups &amp; downs'.   {MR.O.T.DAVIES. </content>
