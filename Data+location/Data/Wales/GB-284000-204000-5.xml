		<content> A CANAL WAS BUILT AT THE BEGINNING OF 
 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, MAINLY TO     
 CARRY COAL,IRON AND LIMESTONE TO THE  
 WHARF AT BRITON FERRY. THE CANAL FELL 
 INTO DECLINE SOME SIXTY YEARS LATER   
 WHEN THE VALE OF NEATH RAILWAY WAS    
 OPENED IN 1851. THE RAILWAY WAS IN    
 OPERATION FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS  
 BUT IN 1962 IT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT  
 WAS FOUND TO BE UNECONOMIC.AS A RESULT
 OF THE CLOSURE, ROAD TRAFFIC TO AND   
 FROM THE WEST MIDLANDS HAS INCREASED  
 CONSIDERABLY. A BY-PASS WAS OPENED AT 
 GLYNNEATH IN 1978 BUT A PROPOSED DUAL 
 CARRIAGEWAY LINKING GLYNNEATH TO      
 ABERDULAIS EIGHT MILES AWAY HAS YET TO
 BE BUILT.
