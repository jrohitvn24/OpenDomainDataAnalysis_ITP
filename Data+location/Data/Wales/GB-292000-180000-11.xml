		<title>11POPULATION-GROWTH OF PENCOED</title>
		<content>      The Parish of Pencoed lies 3     
 miles north east of Bridgend.  It     
 covers an area of 4,000 acres. Most of
 it is low lying land drained by the   
 river Ewenny.  The west and north     
 rises gently to Cefn Hirgoed and      
 Coedymwstwr.                          
      Pencoed is close to the M4 and is
 rapidly growing in size, and has      
 recently been granted town status. The
 motorway and nearby industries have   
 contributed to this rapid growth with 
 many people travelling daily to either
 Cardiff or Swansea.                   
      Several housing estates have been
 developed which vary from two bedroom 
 bungalows to large detached dwellings.
      Unfortunately the population     
 growth has not brought with it an     
 improvement in amenities.
