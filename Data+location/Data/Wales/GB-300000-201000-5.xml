		<content>{A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY.                 
  The day begins at 7 a.m. when I wake 
 up and get ready for school.I dress in
 my blue school uniform and then have  
 my breakfast.I live about two miles   
 from school and catch the school bus. 
 School starts at 8.25 a.m. with       
 registration.We then proceed to       
 assembly and then to our lessons.Our  
 lessons include History,R.E.,Crafts,  
 Geography,Maths,English and Games.At  
 10.25 we have a break to buy crisps   
 and pop in the canteen.We have a 15   
 minute break and then continue work   
 until lunch at 11.45.Some people go   
 home while others have school lunch.  
 Lessons recommence at 12.45 until 2.55
 when we go home.Sometimes we go on    
 trips in the school bus to places of  
 interest such as the Big Pit Mining   
 Museum at Blaenavon.
