		<title>06  A Day in My Family Life</title>
		<content>   When I wake up at 7.40 my mum is    
 down stairs making my Weetabix and    
 coffee. My mum gets up at 6.30 because
 my dad goes to work at 7.30 and she   
 makes his sandwiches.                 
   My dad works as a foreman in a      
 factory called "Girlings", where they 
 make brakes for cars and lorries. My  
 mum does not go out to work.          
   My brother and I go to school where 
 we have Project-Maths and Englsh.We go
 home for dinner. After dinner         
 sometimes we have games. The boys play
 football or baseball while the girls  
 have netball or rounders, depending on
 the season.                           
   School finishes at 3.30. I go home  
 and watch television until my father  
 comes home, then we all have tea.
