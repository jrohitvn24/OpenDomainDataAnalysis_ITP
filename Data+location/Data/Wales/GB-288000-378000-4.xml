		<title>04The Church,Llanddulas.</title>
		<content> St.Cynbryd's Church is situated near  
 the old part of the village.It was    
 first built in the 5th century.Since  
 then the building has been extended   
 and changed.                          
         The church today is much      
 bigger than the old one.The lectern   
 has a golden eagle standing on a gold 
 ball which is very pretty.This has    
 been used by 42 rectors from 1357.    
  Half of Llanddulas school children   
 were christened in St.Cynbryds , and  
 the other half in St.Cynfrans, which  
 is our sister church in Llysfaen.The  
 church gives you money boxes,and many 
 other things such as flowers for our  
 mothers on mothers day.The church     
 always used to be open,but now they   
 lock it just till Sunday,then many    
 people come.The graveyard is nicely   
 set out,and there is an unusual lych  
 gate with a roof on it.               </content>
