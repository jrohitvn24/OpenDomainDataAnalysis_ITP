		<title>16A Welcome in the Hillside</title>
		<content> As a Yorkshire housewife contemplating
 a family move to West Wales many were 
 the doubting Thomases giving warning  
 of the hostility I would find.  They  
 will burn down your home, I was told. 
 What a good thing we took no notice   
 and what a warm welcome we received.  
 It is now two years since our move and
 we have found extreme friendliness and
 good neighbourliness in dyfed.  It is 
 not an artificial olliness tht soon   
 faes but a genuine awareness of the   
 needs of other s ad an acceptance that
 we can each gain rom the other's      
 friendship - a true community spirit..
 Nor are we the only 'foreign' family  
 to have found this welcome.  People   
 from other parts of Britain should    
 refrain from listening to scaremongers
 and come and see from themselves -    
 always keeping in mind they are coming
 to an  old country with rich heritage.</content>
