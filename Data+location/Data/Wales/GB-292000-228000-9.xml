		<title>09LOCAL HISTORY LLWYN-CYNTEFIN</title>
		<content> The westernmost of the larger manor   
 houses of the Usk valley lies next to 
 the Army camp on the north side of    
 the R.Usk.  This is LLWYN-CYNTEFIN    
 which dates, in part, from 1634.      
 It was built by Hugh Penry, who was   
 vicar of Llywel and later of Defynnog.
 Later it passed through marriage to   
 the Williams family of ABERCAMLAIS,   
 the next large house to the east,     
 which lies just outside this area.    
 Llwyn-Cyntefin was sold in the        
 nineteen forties, but much of its land
 still belongs to the Abercamlais      
 estate. This land is the site of one  
 of the most important sheep sales in  
 the locality which is held annually   
 in the second week in September. This 
 is the sale of stock by Cnewr Estates 
 Ltd., which is the largest farm of the
 district.                             
                                       </content>
