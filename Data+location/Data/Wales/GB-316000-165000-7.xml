		<title>07ST.MARY'S WELL BAY</title>
		<content> St.Mary's Well Bay is situated        
 between Sully and Lavernock. It is an 
 interesting place because it has a    
 beach which is mostly sand and        
 pebbles.The sea at low tide is a long 
 way out,very shallow and muddy.       
     Behind the beach are rocky cliffs 
 which are very dangerous to climb or  
 to sit under as rocks fall off.       
     On the cliffs above St Mary's Well
 Bay is a nature reserve where many    
 butterflies and a large number of rare
 flowers are to be found. On these     
 cliffs it is also possible to see     
 pill-boxes left over from the second  
 world war.                            
    Also in St.Mary's Well Bay there is
 a club called "The Pirates' Roost"    
 which is very popular with the        
 tourists from the caravan sites which 
 are at St.Mary's Well Bay.
