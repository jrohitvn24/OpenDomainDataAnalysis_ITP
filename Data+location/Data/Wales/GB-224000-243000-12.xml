		<title>12Village Shops - Post Office</title>
		<content> Llandygwydd village shop and post     
 office used to stock eerything the    
 vilagers neeed.  The shop now only    
 stocks a few sweets but still operates
 as a sub-post office.  Many people    
 have cars and freezers, and           
 consequently they drive to Cadigan to 
 buy food at the supermarkets.  Those  
 who have not got a car go by bus to   
 Cardigan or Walk to Llechryd where    
 there is a general store.  People who 
 are old or unwell rely on mobile      
 shops. People who are old or unwell   
 rely on mobile hsops.  A butcher comes
 twic weekly, the greengrocer comes    
 eery Friday, the coal lorry calls and 
 the milkman comes every two days.     
 There is a shop and post office at    
 Ponthirwaun.  This shop has changed   
 hands several times as people try to  
 make it pay.  It is now in the        
 process of being sold again.          </content>
