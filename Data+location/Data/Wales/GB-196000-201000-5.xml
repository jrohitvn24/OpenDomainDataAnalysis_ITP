		<content>     Most of our block is farming land.
 There are over ten farms. Nearly all  
 the farms keep cattle for beef. Only  
 two of the farms have dairy herds.    
 Some of the farms keep sheep but beef 
 cattle are the most popular livestock 
 in the area. There are very few pigs. 
     One farm, at Winter Hall, keeps   
 poultry. At this farm, there are      
 3O,OOO chickens laying eggs.          
     Most farmers grow corn. Barley is 
 the most popular crop with some oats  
 grown. None of the farmers grow wheat.
     Because of its mild climate,      
 Pembrokeshire is famous for its early 
 potatoes and some of the farmers in   
 the area grow them. Pembrokeshire     
 potatoes are sent to all parts of     
 Britain. Although all the farms use   
 modern equipment and tractors, the    
 farmers still have to be up very early
 to look after the animals.            </content>
