		<title>13THE MALTHOUSE POTTERY.</title>
		<content>   The pottery was built in 1360, it   
 was originally part of a grange used  
 by the monks of Tintern Abbey. It is  
 a rare example of an upper floor hall 
 house.The room  now used as a workshop
 was used for the animals.In the       
 18th.century it was used as a Malt    
 house.It is run by Mr.Naylor and      
 his son Peter.They have been there    
 since 1972.They make domestic pottery,
 producing 20-30 items per day. One    
 of the glazes they use is made from   
 the mud of the river Wye.             
    The pottery is only sold from the  
 workshop.Mr.Naylor also makes items to
 order.Each year the pottery is visited
 by many people particularly parties of
 schoolchildren.They enjoy seeing Mr.  
 Naylor at work and seeing the older   
 part of the house upstairs where the  
 original oak beams are exposed.
