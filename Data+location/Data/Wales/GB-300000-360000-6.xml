		<content>    Important chapel events are visits 
 to the Methodist centre at Trefecca,  
 Brecon.Farming families rarely get a  
 long holiday but sometimes a weekend  
 at this religious centre brings them  
 together.Two or 3 families go each    
 year with those from other chapels.   
    The centre is also used for a 5 day
 devotional visit for the older chapel 
 members.For many this is the only     
 holiday they have.                    
    The minister takes the young       
 children to a local field centre for a
 week. In the mornings Bible Study or  
 project work is done.Afternoons are   
 for walking fishing and swimming.In   
 the evenings visitors and parents come
 along to help with discussion groups. 
    Older children go to the seaside   
 village of Tresaeth where they join   
 children from a mining community in   
 Ammanford.                            </content>
