		<title>03HOUSING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> Housing in the area can be divided    
 into the following broad catagories.  
 1.) Pre-war terraced, built to meet   
 the needs of the increased work force 
 connected with the growth of the coal 
 industry.                             
 2).Post-war council built housing     
 estates                               
 3)Private dwellings of a mixed kind.  
 The terraced houses would be built of 
 local stone or brick and would follow 
 a uniform pattern. A door leading     
 directly from the street into a small 
 passage way and stairs. There would be
 a small room at the front of the house
 kept as a parlour or "Best room". At  
 the rear would be the living room cum 
 kitchen in which there would be an    
 open coal fire place with oven. This  
 room would also contain a small sink  
 and the family effectively spent most 
 of their time in this room.           </content>
