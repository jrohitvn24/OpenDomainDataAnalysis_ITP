 Mr.Anstey has lived at Little         
 Llangoven Farm most of his life and   
 witnessed many changes.He described   
 vividly the village school he attended
 in Raglan at the beginning of the     
 century.As a boy he walked every      
 morning across the meadows.Children   
 who acted the fool in school would    
 almost certainly be dealt with        
 severely,the headmaster has no qualms 
 about making any hand bleed.At        
 secondary school age Mr.Anstey went to
 Monmouth,catching a train every       
 morning at Dingestow.                 
                Until he owned         
 a motor bike in 1924 the trains were a
 life line for Mr.Anstey and this rural
 community.Traffic was so scarce Mr.   
 Anstey would drive sheep to market in 
 Abergavenny without meeting a car.
