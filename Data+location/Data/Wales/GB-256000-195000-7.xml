		<content> In 1961 a man called Gwyn Evans       
 decided to publish a newspaper called 
 the'Chronicle'as well as the'Guardian'
 which he ran already.It was called the
 'Loughor Chronicle at first but is now
 known as the'West Glamorgan Chronicle'
 the word'chronicle'means a record of  
 events in the order that they happen. 
      The paper contains local and     
 sports news,there are advertisments to
 sell cars and houses and competitions.
 Sometimes there are reports about our 
 school.There is a special page for the
 farmers of the area and as            
 the'Chronicle'only comes out every    
 Friday,the weekend television guide.  
      A reporter,Mr Huntley came to    
 tell us about his work.He said that   
 the main work of the paper was to tell
 the local news,including reports of   
 council meetings and court cases.The  
 paper costs 14p and contains 36 pages.</content>
