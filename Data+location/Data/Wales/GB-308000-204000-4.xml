 On the sides of the valley and on the 
 bottom of the valley there is farm and
 forestry land.The farmland is owned by
 the Llewellyn family.On the opposite  
 side of the valley there is a large   
 area of forestry.It was once a        
 woodland of alder,with some hawthorn  
 and oak.A small amount of the alder   
 remains but it is mostly sitka spruce 
 and larch.In the forestry and on the  
 farmland there is evidence of the coal
 industry.There are tracks and the     
 remains of old levels going into the  
 hillside.The trees from other         
 countries are planted to grow quickly.
 Later they will be cut down and the   
 timber sold. During dry weather,fires 
 often occur in or near the forestry.
