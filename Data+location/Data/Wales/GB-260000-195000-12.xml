		<title>12Comin Garn Goch</title>
		<content>  Today{Comin Garn Goch}is an area of  
 marshy fields.A small convalescent    
 hospital stands there.Many years ago  
 it was the scene of a bloody battle   
 when the Welsh defeated the Normans.  
 Many soldiers are said to have been   
 killed in this fierce battle.Comin    
 Garn Goch meaning Common of Red       
 Stones,tells us something of the      
 carnage which took place there. Local 
 tradition says that the blood was up  
 to the horses' fetlocks.              
   The area also has other historical  
 interests; some remains of the Beaker 
 People were found by{Sir John         
{Llewellyn}on an archaeological dig in{
{1855.}It is also the site of an old   
 Roman Camp.However,if you go to Comin 
 Garn Goch today, it is very difficult 
 to find any of these remains,but there
 is a red tint on the stones.
