		<content>  Mr Richards remembers that during the
 1920-1930's the fire engine was a     
 horse and cart with a hose on the     
 back.The milkman delivered milk from a
 churn using a half-pint measure and   
 the baker sold thirteen cakes for the 
 price of twelve.People travelled on   
 foot,horse drawn tram or steam train. 
 There were no televisions or          
 videos.People watched silent movies   
 and later talking movies.Gramophones  
 needed to be wound up but the sound   
 was not good.Nearly everybody went to 
 Sunday School.The annual outing was to
 Ogmore by Sea,travelling in the back  
 of a coal lorry.There they used to    
 play games and scambled for small     
 sweets.                               
  Mr Richards used to help drive herds 
 of cattle along the road to the       
 market.The valley farmers sent their  
 cows down by train.                   </content>
