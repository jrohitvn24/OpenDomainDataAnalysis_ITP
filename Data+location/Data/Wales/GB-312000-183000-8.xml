		<title>08The Ruin of Castell Morgraig</title>
		<content>                                       
 The ruins of the castle are sited on  
 the steep escarpment of Craig         
 Llanishen.   They were first excavated
 in 1903 when digging revealed the     
 remains of a large castle.   The      
 castle was pentagonal in plan with    
 circular bastion towers at four of the
 corners and a rectangular keep at the 
 fifth.   There are virtually no signs 
 of it ever having been lived in.      
 Therefore it must have been built at a
 time when the Welsh were forced to    
 withdraw before the formidable        
 stronghold could be completed.        
                                       
 Much of the castle today is overgrown 
 but with its superb panoramic view    
 over Cardiff and the Bristol Channel  
 it would make a very interesting      
 historical monument.
