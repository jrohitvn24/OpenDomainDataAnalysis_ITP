		<title>05TRAIL FOR THE DISABLED</title>
		<content>   At the Whitestone picnic site and   
 Cleddon Trail the Forestry Commission 
 have created a special trail for the  
 Blind and Partially-sighted.The       
 entrance to the trail has a special   
 gateway to allow wheelchairs easy acc-
 ess.                                  
    The trail is created in a woodland 
 of trees of varying types and ages.The
 area is tranquil and gives a splendid 
 impression of the sites and sounds of 
 a woodland.There are twelve trees     
 along the trail each with a plaque    
 carved with large letters giving      
 information about their age, height   
 and diameter.                         
     The oldest tree is a 95 year old  
 Beech. The youngest is a 31 year old  
 Grand Fir.Visitors can use their hands
 to read the notices and feel the bark 
 of the trees.There is a handrail along
 the length of the trail.              </content>
