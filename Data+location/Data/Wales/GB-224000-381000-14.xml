 The Welsh name for Holyhead           
 is Caergybi.It is interesting to note 
 that the name can be split into two:  
 Caer and Cybi.                        
 Caer is the Welsh name for a fort,    
 this refers to the old Roman fort,the 
 walls of which can still be seen.     
 Cybi;this is the name given to an     
 ancient Welsh saint who had his small 
 church near the walls of the fort but 
 during a later period in history.     
 St Cybi's church is open to the public
 where a variety of artifacts can be   
 seen,as wellas some well appointed    
 stained glass windows.
