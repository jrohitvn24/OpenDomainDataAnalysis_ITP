 Most people have colour TV &amp; reception
 is generally good in the centre of the
 village but bad elsewhere even with   
 the use of signal boosters. Reception 
 of radio 4 is good but VHF varies from
 fair to very bad even with a large    
 outside aerial. We were told the new  
 TV mast at Cemmaes would improve      
 reception but this has not been so. 30
 copies of the Welsh paper "Blewyn Glas
 are sold in the village. Shop sales   
 are 16 Liverpool Post (Welsh edition) 
 2 Guardian, 3 Sun, 3 Mail, 6 Express, 
 2 Telegraph, 1 Mirror &amp; 0 Cambrian    
 news. There are weekly sales of 10    
 Radio Times, 9 TV Times, 30 County    
 Times &amp; 14 Women's magazines.
