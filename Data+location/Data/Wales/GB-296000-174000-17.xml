		<title>17A Working Day of a Parent</title>
		<content>  At 7:00 in the morning Dad's alarm   
 goes off. Then a quarter of an hour   
 later he gets up. He has bran cereal  
 for breakfast while reading the 'Daily
 Telegraph'. He leaves home at 8:00 and
 gets to work at 8:30 in Cardiff. The  
 first thing he does is to check the   
 machines. He discusses the last 24    
 hours progress with the Poduction     
 Manager, Technical Manager, Chief     
 Engineer and foreman. He has a meeting
 with a man from the company's Research
 and Development Centre, to discuss    
 possible new materials for making     
 paper. He then has a meeting with a   
 Marketing Manager and analyses        
 financial data. At approximately 5:15 
 he leaves work and arrives home at    
 5:45. After that he relaxes in the    
 armchair and watches television. Then 
 has supper and goes to bed at 10:30.
