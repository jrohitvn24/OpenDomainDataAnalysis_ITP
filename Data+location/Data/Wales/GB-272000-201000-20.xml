 village is the yearly Carnival        
 organized and run by Alltwen R.F.C.   
 whose aim is to collect money to      
 promote the game of rugby in this     
 area. The week starts with the        
 choosing of Fairy, Rose and Carnival  
 Queens.  In midweek a ladies soccer   
 team competes; a quiz is held another 
 night and Friday night is Mock        
 Carnival Night when men dress up in   
 various costumes (usually as women)   
 and tour the nearby villages with     
 collecting boxes.  Saturday is        
 Carnival Day when people dress in     
 fancy costumes and band together to   
 portray various scenes on lorries.    
 After the Carnival parades through the
 village, the spectators and           
 competitors throng to the school      
 grounds where there are side stalls,  
 shows, snacks, judging &amp; brass bands. </content>
