		<content> Ysgol Emrys ap Iwan was formed in 1967
 by the amalgamation of Abergele       
 Grammar school and Dinorben Secondary 
 Modern school.  The name is that of a 
 local 19th Century man of letters.  At
 that time the school's population was 
 670 but it now exceeds 1200.  The     
 present head, Mr. G. Newman, has      
 recently been appointed to an         
 Inspectoral/Advisory role in the      
 Coventry Authority.  Pupils may leave 
 at 16 years of age but may stay on in 
 the 6th form and proceed to University
 Polytchnics and other colleges.  The  
 catchment area covers not only        
 Abergele but also the surrounding     
 villages including Rhuddlan.          
 Recently the broad curriculum was     
 enlarged further by the inclusion of  
 the School in the Manpower services   
 commission's Technical Vocational     
 Education Initiative (TVEI) scheme.   </content>
