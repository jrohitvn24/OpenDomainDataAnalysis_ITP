 The Captain's Wife was converted from 
 a row of cottages into a pub in 1976. 
 It is situated on the coast at        
 Swanbridge overlooking Sully Island   
 and its causeway.   It is a long low  
 white painted complex of buildings    
 surrounding a flagstoned courtyard in 
 which there is a well of very great   
 age and a dovecote of great beauty.   
 There is a bar and 2 restaurants. The 
 bar has exposed stone walls. There is 
 an old black kitchen range and antique
 settles. Upstairs is a restaurant with
 a gallery overlooking the main bar.   
 The pub was originally the stables    
 of the old Sully Manor House. The well
 is thought to have been in use in     
 Celtic times and still contains fresh 
 water at a depth below sea level.
