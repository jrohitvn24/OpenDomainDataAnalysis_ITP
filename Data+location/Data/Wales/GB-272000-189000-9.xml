		<content>    The local library at Sandfields was
 built in 1961.  It was built by Afan  
 Borough Council.  There are four      
 members of staff including a senior   
 librarian. Very soon they will be     
 losing another member of staff because
 of cutbacks.                          
    There are 4037 members.  3157 are  
 adult members and 1150 are junior     
 members. Mondays, Wednesdays and      
 Saturday mornings are the busiest days
 at the library and between 3:30 and   
 5:00 are the busiest times. Wednesdays
 are probably popular because that is  
 the day when new books arrive. The    
 books are bought centrally by West    
 Glamorgan County Council.             
    Other facilities provided by the   
 library include periodicals,          
 newspapers, cassettes and a reference 
 service. Books can be obtained at the 
 library from anywhere in the country. </content>
