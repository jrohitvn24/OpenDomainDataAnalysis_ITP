		<content>   ECOLOGY.                            
    This is a rural area dominated by  
 the mountain peaks of the Clwydian    
 range, Moel Arthur, Moel Llys-y-coed, 
 and Moel Dywyll, in whose foothills   
 nestle the tiny villages of           
 Rhiwbebyll, Groes fawr, Llangynhafal, 
 and Hendrerwydd. The area has recently
 been designated as one of outstanding 
 natural beauty and is subject to the  
 laws of conservation. The landscape is
 varied, there is limited access to the
 higher ground by narrow roads, but the
 Moels are only accessable by footpath.
 There are many streams flowing from   
 the higher ground to feed to the west,
 the river Clwyd (Afon Clywd), and to  
 the east, these streams have been     
 dammed by the Welsh water authority to
 provide water for the Mold area.
