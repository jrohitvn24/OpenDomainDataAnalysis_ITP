		<title>10TRANSPORT AROUND GLADESTRY</title>
		<content> The main road that goes through       
 Gladestry is a  B-road. But all around
 there are single track lanes. The     
 main road goes from Burlingjobb to    
 Erwood. Our nearest A-road is at      
 Burlingjobb. It ends at Aberystwyth.  
 Most of the roads are single track.   
 They are narrow and dangerous. People 
 need cars because there is only one   
 shop. It is six miles to the shops in 
 Kington. There is a bus to Kington    
 once a week. The nearest railway      
 is Knighton, but the nearest mainline 
 railway is Hereford.                  
 In winter Daihatsus, Land-Rovers, and 
 Range-Rovers are useful in the snow   
 because they are four-wheel drive.    
 It is often difficult to get to school
 in winter because the snow blocks the 
 roads.
