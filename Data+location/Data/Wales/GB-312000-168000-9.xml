		<content> Merthyr Dyfan church.  In a dingle    
 near a brook which flows from colcot  
 is a church dedicated to St Dyfan.    
 there were two saints called dyfan..  
 The first came to christianise our    
 forefathers.  The second Dyfan lived  
 about the C6th and was the son of a   
 Welsh chieftain.  A board attached to 
 the porch of the church states that 8t
 was founded in 600 AD.  It was        
 restored during the middle of the last
 century. Dyfan was martyred and the   
 place where he was Martyred took the  
 name Merthyr Dyfan meaning the Martyr 
 Dyfan.  It is still a centre for      
 christian worship, where regular      
 services witness to the endurance of  
 faith.
