		<content>    The plentiful supply of food living
 in the sand and mudflats attract      
 wading birds and waterfowl.The most   
 numerous waders are dunlin,ringed     
 plover,oystercatcher and curlew.Also  
 seen are bar-tailed godwit,grey plover
 greenshank and redshank.Throughout the
 year cormorants can be seen fishing   
 and standing on the sand banks.In     
 summer herring gulls,black-backed     
 gulls, crows and jackdaws make a      
 thorough job of cleaning up anything  
 edible left by the large number of    
 visitors to the area.                 
{    This record was researched and    
{written by final year pupils of
