		<content>{TRAMWAYS AND RAILWAYS                 
 Nantyglo iron furnaces were erected in
 1795.The iron produce was transported 
 to the Newport-Crumlin Canal via      
 tramroads.The Newport and Nantyglo    
 Railway was proposed by local iron    
 masters,Joseph and Crawshay Bailey,in 
 1842.The proposal was sanctioned by   
 Parliament in 1845 for a railway with 
 a gauge of 4ft.8in.The railway made   
 use of converted tramways.Nantyglo    
 Ironworks provided much of the        
 tramplates,rolling stock  and rails.  
 Brynmawr was connected to the railhead
 at Coalbrook Vale via a tramroad.In   
 1849 Monmouthshire Railway established
 a goods station at Brynmawr but the   
 passenger service was never extended  
 beyond Nantyglo.The LNWR built a      
 branch off the Merthyr-Abergavenny    
 line from Brynmawr to Blaenavon       
 Ironworks in 1870.                    </content>
