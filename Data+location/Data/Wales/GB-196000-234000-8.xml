		<title>08NEW DEVELOPMENTS.HOUSING</title>
		<content> On the surface life in the valley of  
 the Gwaun has hardly changed in the   
 last 50 years.The countryside is      
 totally unspoilt with very little sign
 of new developments.New houses are a  
 rarity in an area protected by the    
 National Park.What new houses that    
 are built are associated in the main  
 with agriculture.They are usually     
 bungalows which are designed to look  
 like the existing buildings found in  
 the valley.The two main reasons for   
 allowing new developments are for the 
 housing of agricultural staff, such as
 cowmen,and when farmers retire they   
 often move out of the farmhouse to let
 a son take over.
