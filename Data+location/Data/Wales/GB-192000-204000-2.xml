		<title>02GREAT HONEYBOROUGH</title>
		<content>   {Great Honeyborough}is just off the 
 main Milford Haven to Pembroke road.  
 Formerly a collection of 3 or 4 farms 
 and a few labourers' cottages, the    
 village now boasts two modern housing 
 estates which sprang up about 10 years
 ago. The estates provide homes for a  
 mainly middle-aged population and     
 their offspring are now in their late 
 teens and early twenties. Most people 
 from the estates who are in work,     
 travel to Milford Haven or Haverford- 
 west and not to Neyland to work.      
    The main feature is the{'Green'    
 with the older properties, a pub 'The 
 Oddfellows', bus stop, telephone and  
 post box. There are also benches,     
 trees and flower beds and the Green is
 still a meeting place for the older   
 residents and a playground for the    
 younger children.
