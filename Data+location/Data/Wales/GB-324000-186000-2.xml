		<title>02HISTORY OF BASSALEG PARISH</title>
		<content>Bassaleg grew up at a point where the  
Roman route to Caerphilly crossed the  
River Ebbw.There is evidence of Iron   
Age occupation on the nearby Gaer      
hillfort,and of a smaller Iron Age     
settlement on Court Farm.              
     Records indicate that St.Basils   
Church in Bassaleg occupies a site of  
Christian worship from before Norman   
tims.After the Norman Conquest Bassaleg
was bequeathed to the monks of         
Glastonbury who occupied a priory until
1216.Since then the fortunes of the    
area have been entwined with the Morgan
family,who became prosperous landowners
in the area.Their influence increased  
with advantageous marriages and the    
growth of the iron and coal masters.   
The Morgans were allied to both of     
these groups.Their historic            
home,Tredegar House is in Newport.
