		<content>  The church is very old and is        
 huge and beautiful. The church door   
 has a font near it. Mr Cobb our vicar 
 stands on the stone next to the font  
 and baptises children.In the church   
 there are lots of interesting things  
 to see. The chancel is where the bells
 are. The choir sit in the chancel.    
 The east Window is a curved shape and 
 is made of coloured glass.            
  The east window tells the story of   
 Abraham and Isaac where Abraham was   
 about to sacrifice his only son       
 Isaac.Inside the church we sing to God
 and pray to God.                      
  The church has a weather vane to tell
 which way the wind is blowing.        
 Out side the church there are lots of 
 grandfathers that have died.
