		<title>08Religion in Rhos</title>
		<content> There are an unusual amount of        
 churches and chapels in such a small  
 village as Rhos.There are 5 churches  
 and 19 chapels.The majority of people 
 in Rhos attend chapel.Most of the     
 chapels were built at the turn of the 
 century between 1905 and 1910.Rhos    
 was part of the parish of Ruabon but  
 the population grew immensely in the  
 middle of the 18th century so the     
 people of Rhos decided to make a      
 separate parish.The Rhos parish church
 was built in 1853.Our school is a     
 'controlled' school.That is it has    
 financial help from the parish church.
 It also serves the local people in    
 baptisims,marriages,funerals,and a    
 variety of services. School links:    
 1.We use the church for our Christmas 
 carol services.                       
 2.Some of the Governors who run the   
 school belong to the Church of Wales. </content>
