		<title>12INTERVIEW WITH EX MAYORESS</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Annie Powell was born in Ystrad
 in 1906.  Her father was the head-    
 master of Bodringallt Boys' School.   
 She was taught in large classes where 
 strict discipline was imposed, later  
 herself becoming a school teacher in  
 the Rhondda Valley.  At this time the 
 face of the valley was totally differ-
 ent, with poor roads and little       
 leisure facilities for young people.  
 She took an active interest in        
 politics and became a member of the   
 Communist Party seeking greater equal-
 ity for the people of her community   
 who lived in poor conditions.  Mrs.   
 Annie Powell has worked throughout    
 her political life to improve the     
 social conditions in the Rhondda      
 Valley, and became the first Comm-    
 unist Councillor to be elected Mayor  
 in Great Britain.
