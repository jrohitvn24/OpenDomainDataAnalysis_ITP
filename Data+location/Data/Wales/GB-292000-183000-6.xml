		<content>  When I get up in the morning I wash  
 and dress and after breakfast I go to 
 school. School begins at 9.15.am. with
 Morning Assembly. We say prayers and  
 sing hymns and read from the Bible.   
  It is then time for classwork and we 
 always begin with Maths. We have      
 playtime at 10.35.am. and for the rest
 of the morning we are taught English  
 and Welsh. Lunch time is from         
 12.15.pm. to 1.15.pm.                 
  In the afternoon we learn History,   
 Geography and Science through Project 
 Work. We also have Art,R.E.,Music,and 
 P.E. I enjoy the afternoon lessons    
 very much.                            
  In the evening I do my homework and  
 then play with my friends. On wet     
 evenings I watch television.
