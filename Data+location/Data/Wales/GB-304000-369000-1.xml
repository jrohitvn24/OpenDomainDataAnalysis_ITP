		<title>01FARMING LIFE</title>
		<content> In square 15 there was a farm called  
 Dedwyddfa which was owned by Mr and   
 Mrs Owens.  Mr and Mrs Owens have     
 lived there for thirty three years.   
 Many years ago Mr Owens grandparents  
 owned it which therefore means that it
 is over 100 years old.  They own 85   
 acres of land which is mostly grazing 
 land for their sheep and horses.  Mr  
 Owens does not grow crops for he works
 most of the day.                      
 Mrs Owens does most of the work on the
 farm : early morning she feeds the    
 animals, late morning she cleans      
 around the farm and throughout the day
 she works in the house cleaning and   
 baking.  Mrs Owens bakes all her food 
 herself e.g.bread, pastry, pies and   
 cakes.                                
 Mrs Owens would not like to live in   
 the city because she would miss the   
 peace and quiet and miss her animals. </content>
