		<title>16Historic Buildings</title>
		<content> The historic buildings in the district
 owe much to the powerful presence of  
 the Wynn family, landowners in the    
 16th and 17th centuries. Gwydir Castle
 was John Wynn's residence, completed  
 in 1555, and Gwydir Uchaf 16O4 was the
 Dower house situated on the high land 
 west of the castle. Much altered over 
 the centuries, the castle was badly   
 damaged in the 192O's, restored by    
 Arthur Clegg, and is open to the      
 public as a tourist attraction by the 
 present owners. Gwydir Uchaf (Upper)  
 lies on the eastern edge of Gwydyr    
 Forest, and is used as the district   
 offices of the Forestry Commission,   
 which mounts exhibitions of forestry  
 practice and wild life of the         
 district. Nearby is Gwydir Uchaf      
 chapel built in 1673. Interested      
 visitors can obtain the key at a      
 cottage close by.                     </content>
