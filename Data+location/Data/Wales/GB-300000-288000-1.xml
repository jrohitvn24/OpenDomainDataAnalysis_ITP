		<title>01Montgomery Area Mid Wales</title>
		<content> Part of Montgomery area, central Powys
 Mid Wales. This area covers the upper 
 part of the severn valley, less than  
 10 miles from its source. The river   
 winds its way through the grid and is 
 flanked on either side by soft rolling
 hills, the highest point being        
 800 ft In the south is the village of 
 Llandinam which consists of about 300 
 inhabitants, the majority of whom     
 works in shops, offices and factories 
 in the neighbouring towns of          
 Llanidloes and Newtown. Around the    
 village are several large farms and   
 some small holdings, the owners of    
 which have a full time job as well.   
 Farming is mixed and while the pasture
 land on side of the river suports     
 mainly freisian cattle, Suffolk cross 
 and welsh half bred sheep, the grassy 
 uplands are ideally suited to the     
 hardier welsh speckled faced sheep    </content>
