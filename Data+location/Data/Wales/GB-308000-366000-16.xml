		<title>16VALE OF CLWYD.</title>
		<content> There are still homes without         
{electricity,hot water or sanitation}in
 the Vale of Clwyd.We visited a stone  
 cottage built around{1760}standing in 
 O'lacre.It has small rooms, small     
 windows, low doorways and uneven slate
 floors. Sanitation consists of an     
 Elsan bucket in an outside shed,      
 chamber pots and a sit-up bath hanging
 on the wall. Here lives a retired     
 couple who worked among natives in    
 Zimbabwe for many years. They eat a   
 mainly vegetarian diet. Days are spent
 gathering wood, gardening walking,    
 writing &amp; reading many letters,       
 filling oil lamps, listening to BBC   
 radio 4 &amp; entertaining visitors from  
 many parts of the world. They are     
 extremely optimistic about the        
 furture, and see the beginning of a   
 trend back to rural life as a sign of 
 hope for western civilisation.        </content>
