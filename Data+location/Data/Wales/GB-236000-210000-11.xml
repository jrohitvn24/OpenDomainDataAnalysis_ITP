		<content> The helcopter managed to save two and 
 the rescue boat managed to save one   
 person. The forth person they could   
 not find.We waved to the man in the   
 helicopter and suprisingly he waved   
 backto us.The serch lasted for 7      
 hours. the men were said to be in     
 their nineteens or twenties.two of the
 men were found climbing up the cliff  
 and the other one was found in the    
 water.An ambulance with a police      
 escort came zooming to the scene.When 
 my dad came back in he was freezing   
 cold.The forth one has been missing   
 for ages and is most probably missing 
 now.So it turned out to be an         
 exighting and tragic evening.
