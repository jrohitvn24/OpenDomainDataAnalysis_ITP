		<content>    The Ancient Borough of Aberafan    
 now forms part of Port Talbot.It lies 
 on a flat plain between the mountains 
 and the sea.A controversial new       
 shopping centre covers most of what   
 used to be the old commercial centre  
 of the town.                          
     Old Sandfields is a maze of       
 terraced houses with the occasional   
 corner shop or pub.                   
   The new Sandfields Estate was built 
 in the early  1950's. A large area of 
 sand dunes between the river Neath    
 and the river Afan was flattened to   
 provide a site for council houses for 
 the familes of steelworks.            
    To the east lies a deep-water      
 harbour and iron ore stockyards which 
 supply the Abbey Works and to the     
 west is the B.P. Chemical plant.
