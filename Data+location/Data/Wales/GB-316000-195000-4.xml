		<content>      The housing dept. deals with the 
 number of houses to be built. They do 
 this by having a survey, counting how 
 many people come into the borough and 
 then deciding how many houses to      
 build. When they have done that they  
 ask building companies to estimate the
 price and they choose the cheapest    
 one. Housing maintainance is very     
 expensive. Most of the money is for   
 the workers salary. The recreation    
 dept. deals with leisure centres and  
 parks. There are four leisure centres 
 in Islwyn. It is very expensive       
 maintaining parks and leisure centres,
 parks being the more expensive to     
 maintain. There is a lot of damage    
 caused by vandals in parks, but hardly
 any in leisure centres because they   
 are manned all day. The enviromental  
 health dept. ensures that our area is 
 as healthy and beneficial as possible.</content>
