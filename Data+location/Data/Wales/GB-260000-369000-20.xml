 leap frog, Star Wars and the girls    
 play  with Sindies (a type of doll).  
      An average school day consists of
 maths, reading, writing and painting, 
 but on Friday afternoon they can do   
 what they want.                       
      The kitchen was built in 1943 as 
 far as we can make out. It does not   
 have many staff, actually only four.  
 Two cooks work all morning and then at
 11.45am. another cook comes in to help
 and at 12 noon the superviser comes   
 in. They have a set menu for each     
 month and the kitchen staff would like
 a microwave oven. The Parents Teachers
 Association (P.T.A.) provide the      
 Christmas dinner for the children.
