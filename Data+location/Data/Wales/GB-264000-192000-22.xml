<title>22Football and Rugby - Changed times!</title>
<content>

How times have changed. &lt;br />&lt;br />1986 and  a forecast of The Swans demise with The Whites on the rise. &lt;br />&lt;br />2011 and  rugby is in the shadows with football being the Premier sport in the city.&lt;br />&lt;br />After a dalliance with extinction in the 80's, There came  the Div 3 title in 2000, rogue ownership,financial administration and a near drop from the league. Local intervention  brought about partial supporter ownerhip and the club has never looked back. A Wembley win in May 2011 sees The Swans now  as Wales' FIRST Premier league Club. Great times indeed.&lt;br />&lt;br />As for rugby, sadly The Whites have been ecliped by the Ospreys as regional rugby holds sway across Wales. St Helens is no longer the ground it was and sporting strength in the city is now defined by the round, not oval ball.   &lt;br />
