		<title>04The Brecon Canal</title>
		<content> The Monmouthshire and Brecon canal    
 started work in 1799 and was completed
 in 1812. It is 33.5 miles long and has
 6 locks. It  has  a tunnel  called the
 Ashford tunnel  and is 370 yards long.
 The canal was built  because the roads
 could  not  cope  with  iron  from the
 industrial towns.When the canal opened
 , the price  of a 100  weight of  coal
 went  down  from 6 new pence  to 4 new
 pence because of the cheaper transport
 offered by the canal. The  canal along
  its whole length runs between the 400
 and 500 foot mark above sea level  and
 along  its whole length, it only rises
 84 feet  by the  help  of 6 locks. The
 canal  starts at  the  public warf  in
 Brecon  and  ends  at  the  5  locks  
 Cwmbran. Until recently the canal has 
 been in a bad state, but now  repairs 
 are  under  way  to  return the it to 
 its former glory.                     </content>
