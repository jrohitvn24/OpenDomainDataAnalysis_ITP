		<title>05ASHBROOK HOUSE, CLYRO</title>
		<content>      Today {Ashbrook House,}is a      
 family residence. On the East facing  
 Wall is a large, arched window        
 overlooking the hall and the stairs.  
 The window was probably built into the
 house following its removal from {St. 
{Michael's Church}during rennovation   
 during the last century.              
      The House is of four stories and 
 presents an imposing presence in the  
 village centre. The name of the house 
 is obviously derived from Clyro Brook 
 which runs beneath the west lawn and  
 the Ash Tree which stands in the East 
 Garden.                               
      The House is now one of many {   
{listed buildings }which make up the   
 traditional core of the present       
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
