		<content>   The village is fairly well served   
 with community facilities which       
 include shops,a post office,primary   
 school,garage,church,chapel,recreation
 ground and public houses.The          
 facilities cater not only for the     
 residents in the village but also for 
 people from a wider area of the       
 Domesday block.                       
      Most of the people interviewed   
 were satisfied with the existing      
 shopping facilities. There was a      
 demand for specific shop types such as
 a chemist and hairdresser but on the  
 whole the level of shopping facilities
 is good for a settlement of this size.
 The village is also well located in   
 relation to the sub-regional shopping 
 centres of Cwmbran,Pontypool and      
 Abergavenny which can all be reached  
 by bus from the village.
