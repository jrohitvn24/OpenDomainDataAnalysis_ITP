		<content>  The area affords great variety. In   
 the East there are gentle lightly     
 wooded hills,interspersed with fields 
 with mature hedgerows. The valley     
 floor of the Conwy is covered with    
 fields, often inundated in wet        
 weather,and used for grazing or       
 silage. Hilly country comprises the   
 western area and includes part of the 
 valleys of the Crafnant and Geirionydd
 rivers. It is sheltered by the        
 mountains to the West and North.      
  This is excellent walking country    
 with pleasant woodlands and rough     
 pasture divided by dry stone walling  
 and mature hedgerows.                 
 Opportunities for orienteering,       
 rambling and climbing abound, and     
 outdoor pursuit centres cater for     
 adventure experience for children from
 the inner cities.                     
  The average rainfall is high.        </content>
