		<title>09EMPLOYMENT IN COSHESTON</title>
		<content>    Before the War, Cosheston people   
 worked mainly on the land. Since the  
 growth of the village due to the      
 building of modern private houses, the
 work patterns people have changed.    
    Today, very few of the villagers   
 work on the land. Most of them work   
 either at the nearby oil refineries,  
 the Power Station or in Pembroke or   
 Pembroke Dock. Although there is very 
 bad unemployment in Pembroke Dock,    
 Cosheston does not seem badly         
 affected by it.                       
    Of the 17 schoolchildren we inter- 
 viewed in Cosheston School, 3 had     
 fathers who were unemployed. 6 worked 
 in the refineries, 1 at the Power     
 Station and the rest worked in        
 Pembroke Dock. None were farmers.     
    Of the children's mothers, 6       
 worked.More Pembroke Dock mothers had 
 jobs than Cosheston mothers.          </content>
