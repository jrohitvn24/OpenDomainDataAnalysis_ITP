		<title>13Hafod Primary School</title>
		<content> The school is over 100 years old. The 
 building is stone and brick with a    
 slate roof.It has a large playground  
 which is separated from the river     
 Rhonddas by a high wall. This year it 
 has been enlarged because the old     
 infants school,a separate building,has
 been demolished. There are 105 pupils 
 in the school aged from 3 to 11 and   
 divided into 4 classes.There is a     
 headteacher who teaches the nursery in
 the mornings,three teachers and a     
 nursery assistant.Another teacher     
 comes in the afternoon for the nursery
 and there is a violin teacher and a   
 remedial reading teacher. In the      
 mornings the secretary attends to the 
 office work.The morning lessons are   
 mainly maths and english, with a      
 variety of subjects in the afternoon.A
 caretaker and his assistant keep the  
 school clean.(Karen Spencer-Hafod)    </content>
