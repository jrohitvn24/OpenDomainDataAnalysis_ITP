		<content> Old Chepstonian,Harry Warren was born 
 in 1906.He went to a Board School     
 which is now a shop which sells glass.
 On the first day he went to school he 
 remembers being given a piece of cloth
 to unravel and he had to put the      
 different coloured threads in separate
 saucers.He liked school until he      
 failed his examination to the grammar 
 school which was in a building called 
 High Trees which is now the District  
 Council Offices.At 14 he left school  
 and went to work doing odd jobs in a  
 hotel.Then he went to work as an      
 apprentice caulker in the shipyard.He 
 got{15 shillings}a week and to give an
 idea of how much that was,1 pint of   
 milk cost 1 penny. Mr. Warren has now 
 retired.He has been mayor of the town 
 and is a well respected local         
 historian.
