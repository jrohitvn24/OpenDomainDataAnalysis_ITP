		<title>06Local Surfing champion</title>
		<content> On the 2nd July 1985 we interviewed   
 Carwyn Williams;this is what we       
 discovered about him.He uses "Sex wax"
 to put on his Crab Island surf        
 board.He is sponsored by Alder and    
 gets Alder Surfwear free, along with  
 free surf boards. He says thrusters (3
 fin boards) make you go faster. We    
 found he wins money,about Â£800, not   
 trophies. He says the best place he's 
 been surfing is Jeffreys Bay in South 
 Africa. We found he has a surf skier  
 for a partner and he says he would    
 like to teach people to surf but has  
 not so far. He is nineteen and has    
 been surfing properly for six years.  
 The best beginners board is the       
 biggest board you can get,but Carwyn  
 has a 5ft.9in board and he has two    
 or three of them . He has won the     
 European Pro-Circuit Championship.
