		<title>11A day at the village school</title>
		<content> The bus brings us all to school,except
 for the ones that live in the village,
 they walk to school. We all go into   
 the cloak-room to hang our bags in,   
 then we all go out to play for about  
 ten minutes. Someone then rings the   
 bell, that means that we all have to  
 go in.We usually have Assembly then.  
 After that we go into the classroom.We
 all read for a while untill the       
 teacher calls out 'TIME-TABLE!' We are
 all split up into four groups, A,B,C, 
 and D. Each group has to look on their
 chart to see what they have to do.    
 They get on with the first thing on   
 their chart. By the time they have    
 finished their first thing, it is     
 playtime. The teacher shouts out      
 'PLAYTIME'. Two girls sell crisps. and
 we all go out to play. We stay out for
 about 15 minutes. The bell goes again,
 we all come in.                       </content>
