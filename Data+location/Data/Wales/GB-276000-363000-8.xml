  The Catholic Church of St. Mary and  
 St. Winifred was built in l964 on the 
 site of a previous church. Two        
 services are held each week. On Sunday
 an average forty people attend for    
 worship, and on Wednesday morning an  
 average attendance is six.  Three     
 churches in the area are under the    
 care of one priest.                   
  St. Mary's Church in Wales was built 
 in l23O by Prince Llewellyn though no 
 part of the original buiding remains, 
 except possibly part of the south     
 wall. A service is held each Sunday   
 at 9.3O.a.m., with a congregation of  
 twenty to twenty-five. The roof of the
 church needs repair, and it is hoped  
 to raise the necessary fifteen        
 thousand pounds by special voluntary  
 efforts.
