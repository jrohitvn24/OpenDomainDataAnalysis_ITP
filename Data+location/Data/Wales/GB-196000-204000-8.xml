		<content>   Running alongside the Marina at     
{Westfield Pill}is the old{Neyland}to  
{Haverfordwest}railway line. This is a 
 grand place to see local wildlife.    
   There have been lots of changes in  
 order to create the new Marina. A dam 
 has been built across the valley just 
 above the Westfield Pill Bridge. Many 
 of the rare{Small{Blue}butterflies    
 have died out because{their habitat   
{was destroyed}by covering it with mud 
 when building the Marina.             
  It is hoped that this area will      
 become a{nature reserve}but nothing   
 has been done, as yet, to carry out   
 this plan.                            
  As you walk towards{Rosemarket,}on   
 the left is a large pool. This pool   
 used to be slightly salty, but should 
 now become fresh, and provide a       
 habitat for a wide range of plants and
 animals.                              </content>
