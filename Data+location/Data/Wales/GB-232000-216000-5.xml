		<content> Included in our block is a very old   
 Charity Primary School,this is in the 
 village of Llangynog.It is not known  
 when the school moved to its present  
 location,however available Log Books  
 tell us that it was pre 1872.There has
 been a school in the area since 1705. 
 Today the school is a 40 children,2   
 teacher establishment.Eventhough the  
 building is old the school is well    
 equiped,for a school of its type. This
 is due to an extent to financial help 
 from The John Vaughan's Charity.During
 the last four years some of the       
 equipment paid for by the             
 charity includes a B.B.C.computer with
 disk drive,an Epson L X 80 printer,a  
 photocopier,an out door heavy duty    
 climbing frame and a set of sport     
 cloathing.The school is a V.C.P school
 and the children often wonder what    
 John Vaughan would make of shool now. </content>
