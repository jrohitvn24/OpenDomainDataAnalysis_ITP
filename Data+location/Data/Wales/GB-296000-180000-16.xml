		<content> Pencoed library is a busy and         
 interesting place. It is useful for   
 people of all ages. There is an area  
 for children and an area for adults.  
 About five hundred people use the     
 library each week. About 450 books are
 taken out every day. In the library   
 there are about twenty six thousand   
 books. There are many types of books  
 in the library. The main librarian is 
 Mr.Davies but several other people    
 work there. The library is a big      
 building and it is painted white. In  
 the library there is a reference      
 section, reference books being books  
 that can not be taken out. The library
 is useful for people to research in if
 they are doing a project for the      
 school. In the library you are not    
 allowed to eat sweets or chocolates.
