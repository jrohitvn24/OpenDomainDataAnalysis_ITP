		<content>     In 1974 Bedlinog was transferred  
 from the Gelligaer U.D.Council to the 
 Merthyr Tydfil Borough Council under  
 the Local Government Act and the      
 Boundary Commision advice.Many people 
 were against such a change but it took
 place.Also in that year the Bedlinog  
 Community Council was formed.At that  
 time it was the smallest council      
 formed and is named in the Act of     
 Parliament which legislated on this.  
 This Community Councl had five members
 and its area included Trelewis.In 1979
 the council was increased in size from
 five members to nine members.         
     In 1974 Mid.Glamorgan became the  
 county authority when the old county  
 of Glamorgan was divided into three   
 areas.
