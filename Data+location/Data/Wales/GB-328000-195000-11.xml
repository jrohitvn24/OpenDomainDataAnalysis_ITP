		<content>{TYPES OF HOMES-}The 3rd &amp;4th yr.pupils
 of Maendy Primary School were         
 questioned about the types of homes in
 which they lived.30 lived in terraced 
 houses,7 in semi-detached houses ,1 in
 a detached house and 1 in aflat.      
{ENERGY AND CONSERVATION-}Of 39 homes, 
 37 had central-heating.23 heated by   
 gas,8 heated by electricity &amp;8 heated 
 by coal.Gas is more popular because it
 is easy to use and is cheaper than    
 other fuels.To keep heating costs low,
 9 homes had doubled -glazed windows,15
 have cavity-wall insulation &amp; 19 have 
 loft insulation.These methods of      
 saving heat are expensive ,the cheaper
 of which is most popular &amp; a Govt.    
 grant is available.These figures may  
 be affected by the number of homes    
 that are owned in our school as there 
 is a large Corporation  housing estate
 in our area.                          </content>
