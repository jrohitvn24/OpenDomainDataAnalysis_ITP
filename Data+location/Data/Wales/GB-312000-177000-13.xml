		<title>13Dean of Llandaff Cathedral.</title>
		<content> The Dean is also vicar of Llandaff    
 parish. He normally gets up at 7:00   
 a.m. and leaves the Deanery at 7:25 to
 go to the Eucharist and Matins.       
 Afterwards he returns home for        
 breakfast.                            
    Then the Dean returns to the       
 Cathedral to meet groups of visiters. 
 Then he carries out any pressing paper
 work at the Deanery with his part-time
 secretary. After lunch the Dean visits
 sick people at home or in hospital and
 he gives Communion to some.           
    Before Evensong at 6:00 p.m. he    
 prepares imminent speaches or sermons.
 Ater that he attends meetings until   
 about 9:30 p.m. before going to bed.  
 His only relaxation is in sleeping.   
    The Dean likes people and the      
 variety his work brings, and he       
 dislikes refusing people and finds    
 comforting people sometimes difficult.</content>
