		<content> The crime level in this area seems low
 and the majority of crimes petty. Now 
 and again you hear of a big fight in  
 Flint, but the most common crimes are 
 shop-lifting or breaking into shops or
 houses. There is some vandalism such  
 as breaking the school windows or     
 writing on walls, but on the whole    
 Flint is quite a safe place to live   
 in.                                   
                                       
 There was a murder committed about    
 five years ago, the victim was only   
 fourteen years old. Most people have  
 forgotton about this.                 
                                       
 When I read the local paper each      
 evening I cannot find many articles   
 about serious crime, this is how I    
 know there is mostly petty crime in   
 this area.
