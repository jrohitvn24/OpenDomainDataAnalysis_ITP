		<title>11Ecology in Saughall</title>
		<content>   We studied trees near our school.   
 Hawthorn is common in hedges,so       
 are privet,blackthorn,and holly.We    
 also found willow, sycamore, hornbeam,
 elder, damson, silverbirch, flowering 
 cherry, horse chestnut cypress, lilac 
 in hedges or at the roadside.Elms have
 suffered from Dutch Elm Disease,but   
 new shoots are growing.               
   In Saughall, most people have either
 fruit, evergreen or ornamental trees  
 planted in their gardens.             
   These are the most common plants    
 by the hedgerow in June: cow parsley, 
 pineapple weed, daisies, nettles,     
 goosegrass and buttercups.            
   In June,the most common bird in     
 Saughall is the starling. These birds 
 are also common: sparrow ,wood pigeon,
 jackdaw, rook, blackbird, housemartin,
 thrush, goldfinch, robin,             
 gull,    swallow and pied wagtail.    </content>
