		<content> A month after Edward 1 had landed at  
 Flint, he moved on to Rhuddlan, near  
 the mouth of the River Clwyd. Rhuddlan
 was an old{Norman town}and he decided 
 to build a{castle}and new planned     
 town. Rhuddlan is a very{historic }   
 village and was until the last century
 the major town of the area. Today     
 Rhuddlan is a small, very pleasant    
 village. The ruins of the castle of   
 Rhuddlan still stand today and many   
{tourists}visit the castle each year.  
 Rhuddlan Village also takes most of   
 the holiday traffic to Rhyl and       
 suffers long{traffic jams}during the  
 peak season along its narrow High     
 Street.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
