		<content> The biggest problem is transport. You 
 have to have your own. Most peoples   
 cars do at least 10000 miles every    
 year and they have to use them.There  
 is a railway not far away but you have
 to use a car to get there.There are   
 very few buses and they only go on the
 main roads.It is hard in the winter   
 because the little lanes get blocked  
 with snow very easily and we have to  
 stock up the deep freezes.You cannot  
 pop down the road to get something.   
 Most people shop once a week and go to
 big places like Hereford (40miles)    
 every now and then. Most children like
 living in the country but they often  
 don't see friends very often out of   
 School because they live a long way   
 off and you have to be taken by car.  
 Shopping costs a lot in the country   
 places and so does petrol.
