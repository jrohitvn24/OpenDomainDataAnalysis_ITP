		<title>11The Gann Estuary</title>
		<content> At the northern end of our sea        
 estuary, the River Gann flows into    
 Milford Haven, and adjacent to the    
 estuary is Pickleridge lagoon These   
 form salt marsh; mud flats; brackish  
 water; reeded habitats which attract a
 great variety of birds. Migrants use  
 the area for feeding and nesting      
 throughout the year, wading birds such
 as the red shank, oyster catcher,     
 cerlew, dunlin turnstones etc. are    
 common and most other species of      
 British wader can be seen. Gulls and  
 cormorants are common with other sea  
 birds such as terns and shearwaters   
 seen when on passage. Duck use the    
 Gann particularly in winter. Mallard, 
 widgein, teal are often seen. In the  
 reed beds, shelduck and swans nest,   
 and buntings, marsh tits and king-    
 fishers can sometimes be seen. Mudflat
