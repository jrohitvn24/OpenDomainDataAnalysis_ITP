		<content> My name is Bethan Sian Jones &amp; I live 
 at Delfryn, Capel Seion with Dad, Mum 
 &amp; my brother Aled. Aled &amp; I both go to
 Capel seion Primary School. My hobbies
 are cycling, swimming &amp; helping Dad at
 work. Dad is employed as a salesman   
 for our local bakery. He has worked   
 there for 22 years since leaving      
 school. My mother also has a parttime 
 job as a Welfare Driver for Social    
 Services. Aled &amp; I have two dogs named
 Russ &amp; Suki, two birds named Benji &amp;  
 Joey and a fish pond containing       
 several types of fish.
