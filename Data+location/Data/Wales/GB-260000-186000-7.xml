		<title>07Our Fire-station visit.</title>
		<content> On July 4th 1985 Robert,Michael       
 &amp; Mark went to visit West Cross Fire  
 Station. First of all we waited for   
 Robert's dad who is a fireman and he  
 arrived at 16.05. When we got to the  
 Fire Station we had a look at the fire
 engine. Rob's dad showed us all the   
 equipment and the hoses. The biggest  
 hose was 180 ft.long.The helmets      
 are made out of compressed cork.After 
 looking at the Fire Engine we went to 
 interview the fire men. Rob's dad was 
 23 when he joined the fire service.   
 The hydrants are checked nearly every 
 day.They use a pole to force the      
 hydrants open.After we had interviewed
 the firemen Robert's dad showed us    
 around the fire station.It was great  
 fun.They were glad we could come.
