		<content>    Borth is a seaside town on the West
 coast of Wales, seven miles north of  
 Aberystwyth University town. Dolybont 
 village is a mile inland and Ynyslas  
 village with its famous sand dunes and
 Dyfi estuary is three miles northwards
    Borth is an elongated settlement   
 built on a shingle beach. The houses  
 and cottages on one side of its main  
 road back onto the beach and those on 
 the other side, onto the drained bog. 
    Borth has a glorious long stretch  
 of beach which joins onto the Ynyslas 
 one, and these together, give a       
 continuous stretch of about five miles
 This, and the safe bathing at Borth   
 has made it very popular with tourists
   Since the railway brought the first 
 tourists in 1863, Borth has flourished
 its economy growing to rely on the    
 tourist trade, with many of its small 
 businesses closing down for the winter</content>
