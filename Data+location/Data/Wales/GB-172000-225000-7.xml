		<title>07Things to do in St Davids</title>
		<content> There are lots of things to do for    
 children of my age in St Davids.Some  
 of these are football training,       
 badminton, cubs &amp; scouts, swimming,   
 piano lessons and the Cathedral choir.
 I go to cubs &amp; badminton and I am     
 going to join football training.      
 There are things for older kids aswell
 like scouts &amp; Air Training Corps. I go
 to cubs because its good fun going on 
 trips and camp and I just enjoy it.   
 Badminton is good fun when we have    
 tournaments and play so many matches  
 each. I like playing singles because  
 you have to do all the work yourself.
