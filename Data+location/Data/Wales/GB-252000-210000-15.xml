		<content> The most popular pastime in Tumble is 
 reading and ninety per cent of the    
 population go regularly to the Library
 to exchange books. Tying with reading 
 is watching television, most          
 householders have two television sets 
 with many also having video recorders 
 either bought or rented.              
   Gardening is also very popular since
 95% of the houses have a garden or    
 lawn. The majority of the residents   
 have a vegetable garden in which they 
 grow their own produce.               
   Going to the three Social Clubs is  
 the fourth most popular pastime,      
 either for a drink and a chat or to   
 attend the bingo sessions and discos. 
   For the female population knitting  
 and sewing is very popular, whilst the
 men prefer to do odd jobs around the  
 house.
