             ________                  
 I get up at 7. o'clock in the morning 
 and go downstairs for my breakfast a  
 cereal and a cup of tea.  Having      
 washed and changed, my mother takes my
 brother and I to school. I wait for my
 friends by the gate.  When the bell   
 rings we go into our lines and file   
 into school.  Having kept my coat and 
 bag I settle down to the morning's    
 work which  includes English and      
 Welsh. .  At playtime we play rounders
 and and very often we see the Mountain
 Rescue helicopter flying above us to  
 answer a distress call in the nearby  
 mountains.                            
                                       
                                       
      During the afternoon we do       
 project work about the locality and   
 our school garden.                    </content>
