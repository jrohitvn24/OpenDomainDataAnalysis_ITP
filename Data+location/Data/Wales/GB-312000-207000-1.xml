		<content>TREDEGAR - as seen by an 11 year old   
                                       
To me Tredegar is home. Tredegar is in 
North Gwent, in between many high      
hills ; it oftens rains here. There    
are many  old buildings which have     
been knocked down.Some of the          
buildings are grey and old looking,    
they have been boarded up. The paths   
of the park are lined with cherry      
trees and daffodils, the park in       
summer is a blaze of colour. On        
wednesday there is an open air market, 
which sells everything .The shops are  
not very good because they are closing 
down. Many of the shops are very old   
and been managed by the same family    
for years.The town clock is the main   
attraction for Tredegar.It stands in   
the centre of the circle.The people of 
Tredegar are very friendly,both old    
and young.                             </content>
