		<content> Dale Fort(G.R. SM(12) 823 052) was    
 built as part of the Milford Haven    
 fortification in 1856.It is built of  
 thick blocks of limestone and granite 
 and is partly dug into the cliffs.It  
 is now used as a Field Studies Centre 
 accommodating about 90 students.There 
 are 3 teaching and about 8 domestic/  
 secretarial staff.Most of the students
 are doing A-level work and come to do 
 fieldwork in marine biology.There are 
 labs and workrooms at the Fort for    
 observing specimens etc.Other students
 come to study or do research on some  
 aspect of ecology.Courses are also run
 for amateurs on archaeology,diving,   
 birdwatching etc.The Fort has its own 
 boat,the Lord Hurcombe used for taking
 students to the offshore islands.It is
 also a climatological weather station,
 recording sunshine,rainfall,          
 temperature,windspeed etc.            </content>
