		<title>04A TYPICAL DAY IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I live two and a half miles from      
 Builth C.P.School so my parents have  
 to take me to school by car.When I    
 arrive in the playground,I usually    
 play cricket (summer and winter) from 
 about 8.30 to 9.00am when the whistle 
 goes for us to go inside for          
 lessons.First of all,we usually finish
 off some topic work left over from the
 day before.Soon,it is time for        
 Assembly and it is sometimes my turn  
 to ring the bell which is kept in our 
 classroom.Assemblies are either taken 
 by various teachers or by a class of  
 children if it is Friday.Back in      
 class,time passes quickly with Englisk
 or Maths lessons until the bell rings 
 for play-time.Then there is a bit of a
 mad rush to get hold of cricket bats  
 and the boys's football but we are not
 supposed to run on the stairs in case 
 of accidents.          {(CONTINUED)   </content>
