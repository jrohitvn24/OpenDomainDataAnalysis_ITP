		<title>05LLANBISTERS' MOTHERS UNION</title>
		<content>    Eighty years old,Llanbister's      
 Mothers Union is an essential part of 
 the villages' social and religious    
 life. Membership is 20 and meetings   
 are held every second Wednesday in the
 Church Hall attached to St.Cynllo's   
 Church. Meetings open with a short    
 service, hymn and prayers followed by 
 a guest speaker who may also show a   
 film. Topics usually being of a       
 religious nature.                     
    Members in turn provide sandwiches 
 and cakes for tea. Business follows,  
 sometimes fund raising, a proposed    
 outing or a special Mothers Union     
 service. Branches within the Diocese  
 often meet and the world wide spread  
 of the movement is exemplified by the 
 annual "Wave of Prayer" each branch   
 linked; Llanbister with Mombasa, Perth
 and Bunbury. Thus the prayers of a few
 become those of a multitude.          </content>
