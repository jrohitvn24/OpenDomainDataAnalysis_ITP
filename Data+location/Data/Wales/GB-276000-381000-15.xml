		<title>15The Llandudno Tram.</title>
		<content>   {The TRAM STATION}is in Church Walks
 and runs up Old Road, Ty Gwyn Road and
 Killen's Hill to Half-way Station.  It
 then continues up the {Great Orme}to  
 the summit.  The system is split into 
 two at Half-way, where the engine room
 is situated.  The tram runs every 20  
 minutes in season (May to Oct) from 9 
 am to 6 pm.  From Victoria Station,   
 Church Walks, to Half-way takes 5.5   
 mins, and 4.5 mins from there to the  
 summit.  The two halves work different
 -ly - the engine at Half-way pulls up 
 the bottom tram and lowers another    
 tram from Half-way on the same cable, 
 which is wrapped round a huge wheel;  
 on the top half, the tram coming down 
 from the summit pulls up the tram from
 Half-way on an almost continuous      
 cable. In 1984, 119,780 people were   
 carried.  It is a great tourist       
 attraction.                           </content>
