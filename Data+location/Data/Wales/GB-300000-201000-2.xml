  Much of the housing in our survey    
 area dates from the 1850's and mainly 
 consists of terraced cottages.Although
 there has been a great deal of new    
 housing built since the war,it has    
 been concentrated in certain areas    
 especially in the Cwmbach area. G.    
 Hosgood (Council Chief Exec.) said    
 that 3 out of 4 houses in the valley  
 were either unfit to live in or in a  
 state of serious disrepair.           
  One of the worst areas in the valley 
 is lower Aberaman, an old ironworks   
 village.The village was built in      
 blocks with little scope to extend the
 properties.Many of the houses have now
 become derelict but some new houses   
 have been built in an effort to retain
 the community.
