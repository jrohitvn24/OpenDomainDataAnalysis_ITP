		<content> Religion plays an important role in   
 the lives of most of the inhabitants  
 of this area.Many people still attend 
 the Baptist Church in the village,    
 built in 1829, 3 times during Sundays 
 for Sunday school and 2 preaching     
 services. The old traditions of Sunday
 school Anniversaries, Revival meetings
 Choral festivals and the 'Christmas   
 tree', a nativity service performed by
 the Sunday school children with       
 presents for good attendance          
 distributd afterwards still prevail as
 does the practice of Baptism by total 
 immersion in the River Marteg.        
   But there are signs of change with  
 interest becoming apparent by younger 
 members in the Pentecostal form of    
 worship, conflicting with the ideas of
 the deacons. It remains to be seen    
 whether the church will have to adapt 
 to survive in the next few years.     </content>
