		<title>10OUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER</title>
		<content> Our local newspaper is called "The    
 Brecon and Radnor Express" and I      
 would like to explain briefly what it 
 looks like,this week,October          
 31st,1985.                            
 The first,second and third pages are  
 all adverts. On pages 4 and 5 there   
 are photographs of weddings and       
 presentations. Page 7 has more photos 
 of Cheese &amp; Wine parties and some     
 Young Farmers Clubs pictures.The 6th  
 and 8th pages both deal with sporting 
 events.Page 9 describes a lot of      
 funerals and sheep-dog trials. On the 
 tenth page the headlines are {"GLOOMY 
{PROSPECTS FOR EDUCATION"}.Events and  
 entertainments are listed on pages 11 
 and 12 while pages 14 and 15 are      
 crammed with Auctioneers &amp; Estate     
 Agents' adverts. The last page is all 
 adverts too but it is useful because  
 you can find out what films are on.   </content>
