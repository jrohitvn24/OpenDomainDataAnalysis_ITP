		<title>11Tump Farm,Whitebrook.</title>
		<content>    Tump Farm is in Whitebrook, near   
 the River Wye. It is pasture land     
 covering 120 acres. The farmer keeps a
 herd of 128 dairy cows, and 900 pigs, 
 which he rears for their meat.        
    The farmer obtains 900 litres of   
 milk from the cows every day. 50      
 bottles of farm milk go to the milkman
 to deliver locally and the rest is    
 taken by milk tanker to Gloucester.   
    Sometimes the farmer goes to       
 market, either in Monmouth or         
 Gloucester, when he wants to sell a   
 surplus of cows or pigs. This year he 
 bred a large number of calves and     
 piglets.                              
    The farmer's family helps on the   
 farm. He does not employ anybody else.
 His day begins at 5.30a.m. &amp; ends at  
 about 7.30p.m. The cows are milked by 
 machinery &amp; the milk is stored in a   
 large tank. It is a typical farm here.</content>
