 Yesterday I went on a School Visit to 
 Carew Castle.  We had to dress up in  
 the clothes of Tudor times.  I dressed
 up as a lady.  First we had to learn a
 dance.  Then we made some hay.  We had
 to cut the grass, put the hay in a    
 line to dry and then turn it over with
 a fork.                               
  After that we went to John the       
 potter.  We made some floor tiles out 
 of clay.  Next I went to the kitchen. 
 I made bread and herb lard.  Later we 
 had some soup that Mistress cook had  
 made and some of the bread that we had
 made.                                 
  After that we had to do the dance we 
 had learned for the Lord Rhys.
