		<content>   ECOLOGY.                            
    Many streams flowing to the east of
 the Clwydian range through an area of 
 moorland heather and bracken, have    
 been dammed by the W.W.A. to form     
 reservoirs which add great beauty to  
 this area.                            
   ACCESS.                             
    The largest of these is the Cilcain
 no 4 or Garth reservoir, and is       
 reached on foot by a road and track,  
 which climbs steeply from a point to  
 the west of Cilcain village. Cars of  
 authorised people, officials and      
 fishermen with permits only, are      
 allowed beyond this point.            
   USAGE.                              
    The water from this reservoir is   
 used to supply areas to the west and  
 north of Mold. It also provides       
 private facilities for fly fishing.
