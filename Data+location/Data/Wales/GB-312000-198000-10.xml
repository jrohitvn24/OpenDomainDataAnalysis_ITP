		<content>  UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE BARGOED AREA     
   The unemployment rates              
 in the Rhymney Valley are consistently
 higher than those for Wales and the   
 county of Mid Glamorgan. In 1972 8.6% 
 of the working population of the      
 Bargoed area were unemployed. In 1985 
 the percentage is 20.3 and still      
 increasing at the present time. The   
 male rate of unemployment is 23.4% and
 the female rate 14.9%. In May 1985,   
 5421 people were unemployed in the    
 Bargoed area - 3988 male, 1433 female.
 (In one local junior school, of those 
 receiving school lunch 81% have free  
 meals).                               
 A recent innovation has been the      
 establishment, just south of Aber     
 -bargoed, by the Rhymney Valley       
 District Council of "Starter Work     
 -shops" in small industrial units.
