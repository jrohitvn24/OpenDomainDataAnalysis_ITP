          _______                      
 The area we studied is a rural farming
 area.The 12km squares contain over    
 thirty farms and homesteads.The farms 
 vary in size,the largest being 170    
 acres and the smallest 5 acres.The    
 larger farms are to be found near the 
 mountain slopes where farmers still   
 own the "grazing rights".The larger   
 farms have well over 500 sheep , the  
 smaller ones having between 20 and    
 30.Dairy farming appears to be on the 
 decline due to the Common Market      
 restrictions.The farms surveyed had a 
 total of 400 acres with an average of 
 30 cows per farm.All farms surveyed   
 use a proportion (up to 20%)of their  
 land for silage or hay growing.On the 
 domestic side there is an average of 3
 sheepdogs and 5 hens per farm.One     
 small farm is now a Riding Centre.    </content>
