		<content> It is morning and my alarm clock has  
 just gone off.I usually stay on until 
 my mum calls me for breakfast.I have  
 toast and tea.I finish it around 8.20 
 then I go to my room .For my school   
 uniform I have a tie,trousers ,shirt  
 and pullover .At 8.30 I catch the bus 
 to school.It is a private bus and many
 people use it.It costs around Â£1 a    
 week for twenty miles.At school I     
 learn Maths,English and a number of   
 other things.School meals cost 55p per
 day the food is alright.At 3.30 I     
 catch the bus home.Usually I watch    
 TV but sometimes I play on my computer
 .At 6.00 my Dad comes home and we have
 dinner we have a variety of food.After
 dinner I go and watch TV and at 9.00 I
 go to bed,I read for two hours and at
