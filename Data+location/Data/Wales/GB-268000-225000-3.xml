		<content> Many of the houses in this area were  
 built in the 19th centuary.They are   
 made out of stones,and many of them   
 are farm houses.In the village there  
 are six council houses,a farm,a school
 ,a Post Office and many small cottages
 .The school building is made of long  
 facing stones,it also has six large   
 windows,a small loby and a small shed 
 where we keep sports equipment.The    
 roof is made out of slates.The Post   
 Office is a small building on the     
 hill.Most of the houses are cottages. 
 There are not many new houses here but
 most of them have been renovated.The  
 newest house is about thirty years old
 .At the bottom of the hill there is an
 old mill which is not in use anymore. 
 It is now a house.There are also many 
 farm houses in the area which are     
 large houses built of local stone and 
 slate.                                </content>
