		<content>                                       
 On school days, I get up at 7.30.     
 Then i read the morning paper.  At    
 7.45 I have my breakfast which is a   
 packet of crisps.  Then I play with a 
 bouncy ball.  At 8 'O'clock I go      
 upstairs to get washed and clean my   
 teeth.  I get dressed and brush my    
 hair.  I then wait for Sara to call   
 for me.  We walk to school and there, 
 we wait on the yard for the teacher.  
 Then we line up.  We go into the      
 classroom and read our reading books. 
 Mrs Lawton calls the register.  Then  
 Mrs Lawton takes a Maths lesson.  We  
 have a rolling time-table. During the 
 week, we do a lot of things such as,  
 Art, English, Maths, Science, Library 
 work, Swimming, P.E. and games.  At 12
 'O'clock we have lunch in the school  
 hall.  School finishes at 3.45.
