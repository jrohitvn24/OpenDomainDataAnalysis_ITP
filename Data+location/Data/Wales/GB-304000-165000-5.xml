		<title>05EDUCATION IN RHOOSE</title>
		<content> There is one Primary School in Rhoose.
 The school is called {Rhws Primary.}  
 This is the Welsh spelling of Rhoose  
 and,as with most proper names in the  
 area, it serves as a reminder that for
 most English place-names there is a   
 Welsh origin.                         
 The school takes children from        
 Reception to 11 years of age. The     
 pupils then transfer to Secondary     
 schools in Barry for the remainder of 
 their compulsory education. There are 
 approximately{270 children}at the     
 school. With the increase in housing  
 provision in the area it seems likely 
 that the numbers in the school will   
 grow in the near future.              
 The main school building was built in 
 the{1930's}and has recently undergone 
 some major alterations. For instance, 
 there was no indoor corridor to       
 connect the classrooms.{(cont.)       </content>
