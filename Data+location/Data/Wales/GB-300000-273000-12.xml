		<content> This is an English speaking area of   
 Wales, with no one speaking welsh as  
 their native tongue. Welsh is taught  
 for \ an hour a week at the primary   
 school to those children whose parents
 agree, and it is a compulsory subject 
 in the secondary school for the first 
 three years, but in general there is  
 no interest in the language. Over the 
 years some welsh words have become    
 corrupted and absorbed into the local 
 dialect subconsciously. This is known 
 as 'Radnorshire' talk and is more     
 noticable amongst the older people in 
 the area.There are also many phrases  
 commonly used which are sometimes     
 puzzling to the stranger such as      
 'starved' to mean cold,not hungry and 
 'tidy' meaning good, not neat.
