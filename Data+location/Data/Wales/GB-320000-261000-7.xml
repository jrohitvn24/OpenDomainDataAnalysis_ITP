 ATTITUDES FAVOUR COUNTRY LIVING       
 AND ARE COMPLETELY DIVORCED FROM URBAN
 LIFE. AN ELDERLY LADY HAVING SUFFERED 
 A STROKE CLINGS TO HER COUNTRY COTTAGE
 RATHER THAN MOVE INTO A SMALL         
 NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE. THE PLEASURES   
 THESE PEOPLE ENJOY COME FROM LIVING   
 CLOSE TO NATURE AND THE BEAUTY OF     
 THEIR SURROUNDINGS. TO SOME, RELIGION 
 IS IMPORTANT. RURAL ACTIVITIES ARE THE
 MAIN INTEREST, BUT THE PEOPLE ARE WELL
 INFORMED OF HAPPENINGS OUTSIDE THEIR  
 OWN DISTRICT AND ARE GENEROUS IN      
 DONATING TO CHARITABLE APPEALS AND    
 INTERNATIONAL DISASTERS.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
