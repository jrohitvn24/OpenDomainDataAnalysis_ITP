		<title>01Our Domesday Block.</title>
		<content> Our Domesday block covers a twelve    
 kilometre block in South West Wales.  
 The children in J2 and J3 have been   
 involved in the project.              
      Ours is a rural area,the greater 
 part of it is farmland and inland     
 water.The estuary of the River Loughor
 takes a great deal of our square while
 the town of Gowerton and parts of     
 Kingsbridge,Garden Village,Loughor and
 Gorseinon also come under our block.  
      The town of Gowerton is the      
 gateway to the beautiful countryside  
 and leisure activities of the Gower   
 peninsula.The area is densely         
 populated in the summer months with   
 visitors from all over Britain and    
 Europe also.                          
      The area is rich in Welsh culture
 and Welsh language is spoken as a     
 first language here.Our school is a   
 Welsh medium school which helps this. </content>
