		<title>11CELEBRATING BIRTHDAYS.</title>
		<content>    The most popular way of celebrating
 a birthday is to have a party.  You   
 can send out invitations to your      
 guests telling them where the party is
 to be held, the date, time and finish.
    The food which you have at parties 
 is usually sandwiches, sausages on    
 sticks, jelly, ice-cream, and a big   
 birthday cake.                        
    Many different games are played    
 such as Blindman's Buff, Musical      
 Bumps, Musical Statues, and Sardines. 
 Sometimes a conjurer or disco will    
 entertain the children.               
                                       
    When the guests arrive they give   
 the host a present and a birthday     
 card. When they leave they are usually
 given some sweets and a piece of cake 
 to take home.                         
    A party is a lot of fun with lots  
 of clearing up afterwards!            </content>
