		<content> We all come in again, If we have      
 finished our first thing, we look on  
 our chart for the second thing, and   
 get on with that. By the time they    
 have finished their second thing, it  
 is Dinnertime. Before we go into      
 dinner the teacher calls out to the   
 oldest boy or girl, 'WASH!'. When they
 have finished washing, they pass on to
 the second oldest, and so on. When    
 every-body has washed, we all go into 
 dinner. Before we start. We all say   
 a prayer together. First of all, the  
 waiter gives all the Infants their    
 dinner first, then the table thats    
 first goes up to get their dinner,    
 when they come down the second table  
 goes up, so on. When everyone has     
 finished their dinner the same        
 happened with the pudding. When we    
 have finished our pudding, we all go  
 out to play again.                    </content>
