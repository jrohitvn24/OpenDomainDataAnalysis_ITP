		<title>17INTERVIEW WITH A LIBRARIAN</title>
		<content> We visited Treharris Library to ask   
 Miss Davies, (the librarian), some    
 questions. As a result of these       
 questions, we were able to discover   
 the following information. The library
 is open six days a week with the      
 busiest days being Wednesday and      
 Friday. We were told there were       
 approximately 13644 books in the      
 library and new books arrive each week
 by van. We asked about losses and Miss
 Davies said very few. Three hundred   
 books go out each week we also were   
 told that there were regular readers  
 each day of the newspapers on display.
 People also came in for a chat. Miss  
 Davies thought that children did not  
 use the library enough. Finally we    
 asked the librarian was there ever any
 change in the number of people using  
 the library. She said there had been  
 an increase during the miners strike. </content>
