		<title>12FARMING IN LOWER PENARTH.</title>
		<content> The tenant farmer has lived at,and    
 well_farmed Cosmeston for 26 years.A  
 gradual introduction of chemical aids 
 has led to improved crop production,  
 more effective animal health measures,
 and improved machinery,together with  
 the dedicated expertise of Mr.Forse,  
 has contributed towards the successful
 and changing farming pattern.A full_  
 time worker assists him,while extra   
 invaluable help is given by his wife  
 and son.Casual labour is employed at  
 busy times on seasonal tasks.Jobs such
 as silage_making,hedge cutting,sheep  
 dipping and shearing,are specific,so  
 contractors must be engaged.The farmer
 is sympathetic to other's needs,damage
 from trespassers who overspill on his 
 land from nearby developments affect  
 his attitude.Routine has stopped the  
 Forse's from taking a break,so retire_
 ment offers their only chance to do so</content>
