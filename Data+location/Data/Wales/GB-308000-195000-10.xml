		<title>10UNEMPLOYMENT IN TREHARRISS</title>
		<content>  that there was a lot of unemployment 
 in Treharris and that the rate of     
 unemployment for the Merthyr District 
 including Treharris is twenty percent.
 The unemployment is peculiar to       
 certain age groups,young people aged  
 sixteen to twenty and to men aged     
 forty five to fifty particuliarly     
 those made redundant from other jobs. 
 Mrs. James told us that there were    
 more men unemployed than women. When  
 we asked her why she said there are   
 more jobs available for skilled women 
 than men. We asked her did she have a 
 lot of jobs to offer and she said she 
 did have a lot of jobs to offer but   
 people were very selective about the  
 jobs they wanted e.g. some people were
 willing to travel and others not. Mrs.
 James did say that the better your    
 education, the better your chance of a
 job.  Lisa Jones.                     </content>
