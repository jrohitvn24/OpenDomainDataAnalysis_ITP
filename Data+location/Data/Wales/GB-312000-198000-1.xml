		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW-BARGOED AREA.</title>
		<content> Map area dominated by township of     
 Bargoed and smaller neighbours,Gilfach
 and Aberbargoed. Name derivation?     
 Welsh word for boundary is bargod.    
 Until 1974 boundary between Glamorgan 
 and Monmouthshire was the Rhymney     
 River running from north to south     
 almost parallel with main road and    
 railway. Typical valley mining        
 communities, nestling in extreme east 
 of Mid Glamorgan. Rows of miners'     
 terraced houses situated along steep  
 hillsides above river. Growth of area 
 due to coal. Most of land cover       
 outside communities is moorland and   
 heath, uncultivated. Some enclosed    
 land for rough grazing. Throughout    
 valley derelict land reclamation      
 schemes restoring  greenery destroyed 
 by industrial revolution.
