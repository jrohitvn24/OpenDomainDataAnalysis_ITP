		<title>17The Court Leet 'A'.</title>
		<content> After 1066,William the Conquerer      
 'gave' the lands he had won to some of
 his best friends,they were Norman     
 Lords.In places like Newport the local
 Welsh people had to give up all       
 control of the economic life of the   
 community.The lord now set up two     
 courts and got locals to serve on them
 by making them BURGESSES and offering 
 them rented accommodation,fertile     
 land,water rights, forest rights and  
 were able to trade free of tolls in   
 the markets and fairs.                
 The first court was the COURT         
 LEET which met twice each year,it was 
 responsible for collecting            
 fines,listing burgesses and their     
 occupations,appointing new burgesses  
 as well as taking good care of the    
 lord's property at all times.It had   
 also to appoint 15 Jurors each year to
 serve on the HUNDRED(or AREA) COURT.  </content>
