		<content>    Outside the St Hilary building     
 there is a large pool of water which  
 is used in case of fire.The mast and  
 building took about one year to build.
 It originally conveyed V.H.S.waves as 
 the mast is strategically positioned  
 to give the best coverage of the area.
    The mast is 750 feet tall,and      
 weighs 120 tonnes.It sits on a 2.5    
 ball bearing,and is held in place by  
 staywires and cables.                 
    It is repaired whenever it         
 fails,and is also visited by          
 specialists every month.              
    Various aerials and dishes hang    
 from the mast,but not all of them     
 belong to the I.B.A.Some belong to    
 other users such as the Electricity   
 Board and the Water Board,who use the 
 mast for radio transmission purposes.
