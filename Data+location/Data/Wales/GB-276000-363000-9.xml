 apart from school leavers.            
 Employment for men is mainly at the   
 Aluminium Corporation Works at nearby 
 Dolgarrog, and at the Trefriw Woollen 
 Mill in the centre of Trefriw where 2O
 women and lO men are employed.Other   
 work in the area includes farming and 
 forestry in nearby conifer forests.   
 The tourist industry is of great      
 importance,contributing to the success
 of local shops, licensed premises, and
 restaurants.Accommodation is provided 
 in 3 boarding houses,5 licensed       
 restaurants, and several bed and      
 breakfast establishments. One of the  
 two caravan sites has received the

 Other residents are retired,          
 self-employed,or commute by car to    
 more distant places of work.          </content>
