		<title>06Oil slick threatens birdlife</title>
		<content> Two large oil slicks are feared to be 
 heading towards the bird sanctuary    
 island of Grassholm after a 1300 ton  
 oil tanker,the 'Brigeness',collided   
 with rocks known as the Barrels three 
 miles west of the island on Sunday    
 night,discharging 310 tonnes of heavy 
 fuel oil into the sea.                
 This was the report in the County Echo
 of 18th June 1985.                    
 The R.S.P.B. went out to Grassholm    
 to save the Gannets and the Puffins.We
 don't know how many have died but it  
 wasn't the Gannets that were affected 
 the most-it was the Puffins.          
 It was when the birds dived into the  
 sea that they were affected,because   
 when they surfaced they were too heavy
 to fly.They then pecked the oil off   
 their plumage and then they got       
 poisoned.
