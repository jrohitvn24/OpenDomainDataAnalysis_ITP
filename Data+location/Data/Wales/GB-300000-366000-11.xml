		<content>    The village school opened in 1904. 
  It has five teachers and eighty-five 
  pupils aged between four and eleven. 
  The school is traditional in         
  teaching methods and interior design.
    In recent years only 20% of new    
  entrants have been able to speak     
  Welsh; upon leaving 50% of each year 
  group have become fluent in Welsh.   
    Playground entertainment consists  
  mainly of variations on the game of  
  'tip'. It includes:'British Bulldog' 
  'Polo' and 'Tip around the Circle'.  
  One popular game is 'London', in     
  which a group run towards one child  
  who spells out L-O-N-D-O-N. If anyone
  is seen moving at the end he goes    
  back to the start.                   
                                       
   At the age of 11, pupils leave to   
  attend Denbigh High School or Ysgol  
  Glan Clwyd, St. Asaph.               </content>
