		<content> THESE ARE TWO VERY SMALL HAMLETS AT   
 THE VERY FOOT OF THE BERWYN HILLS. ALL
 THE HOUSES ARE VERY OLD,NO-ONE IS     
 ALLOWED TO BUILD NEW HOUSES THERE     
 BECAUSE IT WOULD SPOIL THE APPEARANCE.
 THE HOUSES LOOK OLD, THOUGH THEY ARE  
 IN GOOD CONDITION. INSIDE THEY HAVE   
 LOTS OF EXPOSED BEAMS AND THINGS LIKE 
 THAT BECAUSE THEIR OWNERS THINK THAT  
 GIVES THEM CHARACTER.A CRAFT SHOP HAS 
 JUST OPENED UP IN AN OLD BARN IN FRON 
 UCHA, BUT WE DONT THINK IT WILL DO    
 MUCH TRADE BECAAUSE IT IS ABOUT ONE   
 MILE OFF THE A5 UP ONE WINDING LANE   
 AND A STEEP HILL. BUT THERE ARE LOTS  
 OF TOURSITS TRAVELLING ON THE A5 AND  
 LOTS OF THEM LIKE CRAFT THINGS AND    
 ANTIQUES SO WE MIGHT BE WRONG.THE     
 HAMLETS ARE ALL RIGHT IN SUMMER BUT WE
 DONT LIKE THEM IN WINTER.
