		<content> Welsh and English is spoken in        
 Alltwen.  Many of the original        
 inhabitants are bilingual.  Recent    
 housing developments have brought an  
 influx of English and Anglo-Welsh.    
 Although there is still a strong Welsh
 tradition, the majority of the younger
 generation speak only English.  Only 6
 of the 230 pupils in Alltwen Primary  
 School speak Welsh.  (Most of the     
 Welsh speaking children attend Welsh  
 schools.  In 1926 92% of the children 
 spoke Welsh - many of them monoglot.  
       The Welsh spoken here is        
 peculiar to the area eg. Dywedodd (he 
 said) is pronounced - 'wetws'- the    
 ending 'ws' still in usage from early 
 Welsh.  The consonants are hardened - 
 't' instead of 'd' and the first      
 syllable dropped.  The English spoken 
 has adopted a Welsh flavour eg. the   
 Nant (River), the Coed (Trees).       </content>
