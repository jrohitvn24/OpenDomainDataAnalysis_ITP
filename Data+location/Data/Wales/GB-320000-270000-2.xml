 In the block covered there are about  
 50 houses and farms with a total      
 population of about 114 people. Seven 
 more houses in the village are used as
 seasonal homes. The primary school in 
 the village closed last year since its
 roll  had dropped below 10 and there  
 were few children under the age of    
 five.                                 
 Ten houses have been sold in the last 
 two years but of the incoming         
 families, only two have children of   
 school age and one of these families  
 sends their children away to school.  
 It is obviously a time of transition  
 in the village and it remains to be   
 seen whether Llangunllo can assimilate
 so large an influx of incomers without
 losing its essential character.
