		<content> When I was a little girl my name was  
 Gwenllian Jenkins. I was one of eleven
 children. I had ten brothers. I was   
 born in Trebanos but at nine months   
 old I came to live in Saron Chapel    
 cottage and I have lived there ever   
 since - 73 years. Rhyd y fro was very 
 different then. I can remember only   
 two people who owned cars, the        
 minister and the blacksmith.          
     I started school at the age of    
 five but as I lived opposite the      
 school I often sneaked home to help my
 mother. I liked school and was        
 especially good at reading but also   
 enjoyed essays, writing in my diary,  
 arithmetic and sewing. Our teachers   
 were kind but very strict and naughty 
 children always got the cane. At      
 playtime we played with hoops, whips  
 and tops but my favourite game was    
 cricket.                              </content>
