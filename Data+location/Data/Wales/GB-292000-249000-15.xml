 family by 1642. Sarah Gwynne was      
 married to Charles Wesley by his      
 brother John, at Llanlleonfel Church  
 in 1749. Charles is said to have been 
 inspired to write "Jesu, Lover of my  
 soul" here when a robin flew in       
 seeking shelter during a thunderstorm.
 Since 1912, the home of the Wilson    
 family.                               
 At side of A483 below Llanlleonfel    
 Church is a sulphur spring known as   
 "Billy Wern" once used for medicinal  
 purposes.                             
 Caerau Farm, Beulah is on the site of 
 a Roman garrison. Roman pottery has   
 been dug up on the farm. The road to  
 Llangammarch follows a Roman road.    
 There is also an Early British earth- 
 works sited there, and one on Twdyn,  
 Beulah which is better preserved.
