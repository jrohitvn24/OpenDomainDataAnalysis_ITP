		<title>12NANTGLYN SCHOOLCHILDREN</title>
		<content>    The pupils in the junior class     
 liked their school and enjoyed the    
{lifestyle}of the area because of its  
 quietness.The only complaint was the  
 lack of a village shop. Almost half   
 lived on farms and 3 pupils came to   
 school by taxi.Sometimes winter snow  
 cut them off but most pupils lived    
 less than a mile away so they walked  
 or came by car.{Pets}were owned by 3/4
 of the children;all the farms had dogs
 and most had cats;there was a budgie  
 and a rabbit.Reading was the most     
{popular hobby,}soap operas especially 
 Dynasty,were preferred to childrens TV
 Pop groups appealing to teenagers     
 such as Duran Duran were popular with 
 a few{10 year olds.}Others still liked
 horse riding,piano playing, walking,  
 helping on the farm or just 'playing  
 games'.The average number of children 
 per family was 2.8,the national is 2.1</content>
