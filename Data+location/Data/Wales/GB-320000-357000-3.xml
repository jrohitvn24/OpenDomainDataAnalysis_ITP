		<content>   {Farming on marginal land.}         
  This area has mainly dairy farming   
 using mostly Friesian cows. Sheep     
 farming is also very much part of the 
 area as is cattle rearing for the     
 fat-stock market.                     
  It is mainly good quality arable     
 land, with some bog land. Growing     
 crops are cereals, barley and oats,   
 some rape is also grown for sheep     
 feed. Grass is cut for silage and hay.
  The farms in this area are quite     
 large for this part of Clwyd, owned   
 for the most part by the same families
 for generations.                      
  There are a few small holdings, with 
 sheep and young stock for the beef    
 market.                               
  One farm has just started rabbit     
 farming. The rabbits are sold to a    
 retailer for meat, as are chickens in 
 some parts of the area.               </content>
