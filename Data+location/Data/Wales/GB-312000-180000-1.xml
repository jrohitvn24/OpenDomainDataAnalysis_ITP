		<content> The block surveyed is a good example  
 of erosion of the "green belt" by     
 housing and industrial development.   
 Housing developments on farmland      
 include Pantmawr(1953),Coryton(1957)  
 and the Castle View &amp; Loughor Estates 
 at Radyr.Industrial commercial        
 developments include Amersham         
 International(1980),Asda superstore   
 (1984) &amp; A.B.Electronics(1985).These  
 are all built on the former Forest    
 Farm while the Telecom building was   
 built in the grounds of Coryton House 
 formerly owned by the Cory family.    
 During recent years the centre of     
 Whitchurch has grown into the  main   
 shopping centre of the area.It appears
 to be thriving despite the presence of
 the ASDA superstore.The M4 motorway   
 with its interchange at Coryton and   
 the trunk road to Merthyr make  the   
 area very accessible to other regions.</content>
