		<content> There are 44 children in my school.34 
 come from English homes,and 10 from   
 Welsh homes,but we all speak Welsh.I  
 like our school uniform-the tie has   
 got light blue and dark blue diagonal 
 lines,the shirt or blouse is white and
 the sweater is V-necked,light blue    
 with the school badge in dark blue on 
 it.The badge is a silouette of the red
 kite,with the words"YSGOL             
 SWYDDFFYNNON" encircling it.We have 3 
 teachers,and are split into groups of 
 16 with Mr. Jones,15 with Mrs. Rose   
 and 13 with Mrs. Williams.We have     
 plenty of variety in our              
 lessons-Maths,Welsh,English,Computer, 
 Games,Sewing,Craft,Singing,Television,
 and lots of projects.We are having an 
 extension built because there is not  
 enough room,and up to now we have only
 had outside toilets situated across   
 the yard.They are horrible.           </content>
