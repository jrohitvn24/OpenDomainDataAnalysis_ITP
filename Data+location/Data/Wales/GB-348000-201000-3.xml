		<content> Catbrook Poultry Farm has 8O,OOO      
 laying hens.  They start laying when  
 they are about 22 weeks old and are   
 kept until they reach 76 weeks old.   
 The hens consume about 48 tonnes of   
 layers ration a week.  Up to 45O,OOO  
 eggs are produced by this type of     
 farming in  one week.  The farm has   
 employment for 3 full-time stockmen   
 and ten part-time egg collectors.     
 The eggs are collected and sent to    
 Monmouth for packing.  They are graded
 and distributed to the shops.         
 All the cracked and soft-shelled eggs 
 are cracked out and mashed up into a  
 melange, frozen and sent to London to 
 be pasteurised and used by cake       
 manufacturers.                        
 The manure from the hens is collected 
 by local farmers and used as a general
 fertilizer.                           
                                       </content>
