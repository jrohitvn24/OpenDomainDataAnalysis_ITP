 serves Port Talbot district. There are
 49 trained nurses and 23 untrained    
 nurses. There are 18 consultants (7   
 operate), 2 housedoctors, and 3       
 anaesthetists. There are 7 kitchen    
 staff and 24 cleaning staff.          
   In our local dentist there are 4    
 dentists in one practice. The dentist 
 does fillings mostly.                 
   There are two old peoples homes. 39 
 local old people live at Morawelon.   
 They go to the homes because they can 
 no longer look after themselves.      
   There are 5 surgeries in the Health 
 Centre. Twelve doctors work there.    
 They each see approximately 40        
 patients per day. There are 5         
 different clinics with nurses who give
 injections, take blood and do         
 dressings.
