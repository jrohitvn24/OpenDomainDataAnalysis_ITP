		<title>15EQUIPMENT FOR HOME AND FARM</title>
		<content> Our parents have a lot more equipment 
 to help than our grandparents had. In 
 all our homes we have washing         
 machines. Most of them are automatic, 
 but some are twin-tub with a separate 
 part for washing and drying. Everyone 
 has a vacuum cleaner to clean the     
 floor. All homes have a refrigerator  
 to keep food cool, and a freezer to   
 keep food cold for a long time. In the
 kitchen there are many electrical     
 appliances, such as toasters, kettles,
 sandwich toasters, and food mixers.   
 All farms have at least one tractor   
 now. Others machines are worked from  
 them, such as mowers, and balers for  
 making the hay into bales. The newest 
 machine is a round baler which makes  
 big bales. These are carried around by
 a special spike fitted to the front of
 the tractor. There are machines for   
 spraying and muck spreading.          </content>
