 established.  The market is held every
 Monday and animals sold here include  
 heifers, bullocks, dairy cows,        
 calves,fat pigs and all types of      
 sheep.  The annual throughput of sheep
 is the largest in the Common Market   
 and the market can hold 15-16,000     
 sheep and 700 cattle on one day.
