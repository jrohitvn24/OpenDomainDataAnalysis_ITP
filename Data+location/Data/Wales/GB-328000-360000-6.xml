		<content>  The main settlement in our area at   
 study are the villages of Penyfford   
 and Penymynydd.Both of these villages 
 have developed in a linear fashion in 
 the main Hawrden to Wrexham road ,the 
 A 550.                                
  The population at these two          
 villages, has gone up from about 1 000
 in the 1950's to around 2 000 today   
 because of the building of new estates
 and the population is still rising.   
  The centre of the vilage is composed 
 of old turn of the century houses     
 which are grouped around the village  
 shops.The inhabitants of these houses 
 are mainly old people.                
  The outskirts of the town are made up
 of modern housing estates, here the   
 houses built 20 - 45 years ago are    
 Semi-detached or Detached.Here the    
 inhabitants are mainly young families.
