		<content> Late in 1984 the Bancyfelin by-pass

 runs parallel to the old A40 and it   
 has made a vast difference.           
 On July 1 1985 the following vehicles 
 were seen on the new road between     
 2-3pm.Travelling East-West,cars and   
 light vans 396,lorries 85,caravans    
 18,motor bikes 3,army vehicles 10.    
 Travelling West-East cars and light   
 vans 245,lorries 117,caravans 5,army  
 transport eight.18 buses werw also    
 seen during the hour.                 
 The village of Bancyfelin is now very 
 quiet,a ribbon development,most of the
 houses are alongside the old main road
 People can now park their cars outside
 their houses,cross the road fairly    
 safely.Some farms have been divided by
 the new road and are served by under- 
 passes.The village filling-station has
 closed and the pub lost passing trade.</content>
