		<title>15Biography Of Famous Artist</title>
		<content> Nicholas Evans is one of the world's  
 best artists.He was born in Aberdare  
 on 10th of January 1907.He worked as  
 an engine driver for British Rail     
 until his retirement.                 
    When he was 71 years of age he was 
 awarded Â£1000 by the Welsh Arts       
 Council.This resulted in his holding 2
 one_man exhibitions.He went on to     
 exhibit his paintings in the National 
 Eisteddfod for 9 years running and    
 received prizes for them.             
    His work was discussed on the radio
 programme "Critic's Forum."           
    The Royal Academy of Arts accepted 
 two of his oil paintings for their    
 1979 Summer Exhibition.               
    The strange thing is that he never 
 uses colour when painting.His         
 paintings consist of black or dark    
 blue oil paints only.The paintings are
 described as "velvety"and"iconlike."  </content>
