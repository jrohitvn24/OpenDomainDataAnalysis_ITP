		<content> Eighty years ago when the first       
 carpenter's shop was built at Ffynnon 
 Gynydd,there was already a very busy  
 blacksmith here working in his shop   
 under the chestnut tree.The two crafts
 men worked closely together as wheel- 
 wright and carpenter.However,horses   
 were replaced by tractors and work    
 declined.Oldfashioned cowsheds were   
 being replaced by larger multi-purpose
 buildings and the wheelwright and     
 blacksmith of years ago became the    
{Constructional Engineers}of today.The 
 same family now have a very large work
 shop on the same sight.They employ 3  
 inside the workshop,1 on the excavator
 and 3 constructing the barns.A draught
 sman draws up the plans.The steel is  
 cut by a bandsaw,a chopper,a punching 
 machine and a drill.A great deal of   
 welding is carried out.The steel is   
 paint sprayed.                        </content>
