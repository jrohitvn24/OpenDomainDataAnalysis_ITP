		<content> USK AREA - FIRE STATION               
 There is a Fire Station on on Monmouth
 Rd, which has two full-time Fire      
 Prevetion Officers.  When the fire    
 alarm is raised the fire engine is    
 very quickly manned by part-time      
 firemen working locally, available at 
 the time.  The Fire Brigade covers a  
 large rural area, and is not only     
 called for house and farm fires, but  
 also to any traffic incidents where   
 there is fire danger.  They also      
 rescue cows from slurry pits on farms.
 This service is provided by the Gwent 
 County Council.
