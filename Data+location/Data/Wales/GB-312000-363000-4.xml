		<content>   ECOLOGY-LAND.                       
    A completely rural landscape of    
 rich farmland, small fields enclosed  
 with high, well kept hedges, or       
 walling of dry stone or slate. There  
 are many paths and tracks, not very   
 well maintained and often with the    
 stream running at the side. The land  
 is mainly natural grazing land with   
 some fields of cereal crops.          
   VEGETATION.                         
    The hedgerows are of hawthorne with
 elder and blackberry, and the trees,  
 in plentiful supply, are of the broad 
 leaved deciduous variety, Rowan,      
 Beech, Oak, Ash, and Sycamore.        
   WILDLIFE.                           
    There is much evidence of wildlife 
 in the area rabbits, badgers, and     
 foxes. Birdlife is plentiful, and     
 sparrow hawks have been seen.
