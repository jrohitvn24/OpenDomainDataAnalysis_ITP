		<title>05VALE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> This area of the eastern Vale of      
 Glamorgan consists of gently rolling  
 hills and broad shallow valleys.      
 Steeper slopes are often wooded with  
 deciduous trees and the small copses  
 and tree lined hedgerows combine to   
 give a rich{rural atmosphere.         
 Settlements are largely restricted to 
 scattered{farms}and small hamlets.    
 The underlying liassic limestone rock 
 gives heavy, though fertile soils, and
 with the mild wet climate{agriculture 
 is based on grassland. Dairying is the
 most important activity with most     
 farms milking 80-120 Freesian cows.   
 Grass is re-seeded in either 3 year or
 5 year leys, and hay and silage are   
 made for winter feed. Cereal          
 production is limited to animal       
 feedstuffs, usually barley with some  
 maize.
