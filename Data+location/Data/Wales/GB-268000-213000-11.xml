		<title>11LANDSCAPE AND BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> The landscape within our block is     
 dominated by the {Black Mountains}    
 which rise in the North of the block. 
 The rest of the block consists of     
 villages built along valley floors.   
 The building within these villages are
 typical of an area  dominated by early
 coal works:  With a large number of   
 short terraced streets of company     
 houses.                               
 The main buildings of architectural   
 interest, within the block, are the   
 two {Public Halls}one in Brynamman and
 one in Garnant.  Both have been       
 converted into cinemas at one time    
 oranother and whilst the Brynamman    
 Hall is still used to this end the    
 Garnant Hall has now been sold and    
 converted into a warehouse for a local
 firm of building suppliers.
