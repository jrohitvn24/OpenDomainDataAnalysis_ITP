		<title>14ARTS AND CRAFTS IN WELSHPOOL</title>
		<content> The largest displays of Arts and      
 Crafts are displayed at the Oriel 31  
 art gallery which was opened in 1982. 
 Displays here are shown once a month  
 and include those by famous artists   
 eg. Jonathan Kingdom, local artists   
 and school children. The stock of     
 original prints held in the Oriel is  
 the largest in Wales. The Gallery runs
 life drawing classes, poetry readings,
 children's art classes, drawing       
 classes and organises visits to       
 galleries and museums.                
 Exhibitions are also held at the      
 Library. At present there is a display
 of work done by junior school pupils  
 commemorating the 500th anniversary of
 the Battle Of Bosworth with drawings  
 of life at the time and showing Henry 
 Tudor's route to the battle via       
 Welshpool.
