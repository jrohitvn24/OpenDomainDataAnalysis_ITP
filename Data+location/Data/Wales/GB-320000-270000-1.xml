		<content> This sparsely populated area is rural 
 in character. It lies in the upper    
 reaches of the narrow steep-sided,    
 U-shaped valley of the River Lugg.    
 Llangunnlo, a small long-established  
 nucleated village, clusters around the
 church on the banks of the river in   
 Square 5. It lies at an average height
 of 240 metres.                        
 The land around the village consists  
 of relatively small family farms      
 devolted to livestock farming. The    
 majority of thesse farms average 200 -
 300 acres, their main enterprise being
 sheep.                                
 The village is seven miles from       
 Knighton, the nearest town, thirty -  
 eight miles from Hereford and fourty  
 miles from Shrewsbury.                
 This area of the Welsh borders is     
 served by a road network of country   
 lanes, 'B' and minor 'A' roads.       </content>
