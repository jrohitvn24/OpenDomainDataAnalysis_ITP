           Most of the buildings in our
 are made of stone.This is because most
 of them were built in the late        
 ninetenth and early twentieth century.
 Such is our house.We have all modern  
 conveniences,as we have modernised our
 house recently.Nowadays with the aid  
 of Council Grants i.e money from the  
 council,it is far easier to renovate  
 old houses.                           
           There are also many brick   
 buildings,some of which were built    
 recently and some dating from early   
 this century.                         
           Since the war (1939-1945)   
 many pre-fabricated or engineered     
 buildings have been built             
 here.Nowadays we suspect this is how  
 the houses of the future will be      
 built.                                </content>
