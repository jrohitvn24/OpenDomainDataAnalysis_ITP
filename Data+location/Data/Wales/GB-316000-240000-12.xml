		<title>12Fishing-My Hobby-Ian Morris.</title>
		<content> Most days when I am off school I pack 
 my fishing equipment and go to the    
 River Wye.I mostly fish for trout.I   
 use size 8 hooks because I think size 
 8 hooks are the best for trout.I also 
 use spinners,flies or worms.My rod is 
 6 foot long.I use all sorts of lead   
 weights, split shots and lots of      
 other weights.Some times I fish for   
 Chub as well as Trout.It feels great  
 when you have a bite after waiting    
 hours and hours on the bank.          
 My best catch was when I caught eight 
 Trout in a day.My worst catch was     
 when I caught no Trout at all.On      
 average I catch about four Trout at a 
 time.                                 
 I love fishing on the River Wye, it is
 my favourite hobby.I fish alot with my
 father.
