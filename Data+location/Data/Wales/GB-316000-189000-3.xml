		<content>             Several of the old shops  
 that used to be in the village have   
 closed down during the last twenty    
 years.No one wished to reopen them so 
 the council bought them and changed   
 them into flats. These flats are      
 rented to one parent families or to   
 people who have family problems.      
              A small row of twelve    
 new houses has been built in          
 Commercial Buildings by the{Family    
{Care Housing Association}and these are
 also rented to families who have      
 social problems.                      
              A few new private houses 
 have been built in Cwmfelinfach in the
 last ten years.The new houses have all
 been built on the side of the mountain
 because there is no room to build in  
 the valley itself.Nearly all of these 
 new houses are bungalows built from   
 bricks.Most of them are detached.     </content>
