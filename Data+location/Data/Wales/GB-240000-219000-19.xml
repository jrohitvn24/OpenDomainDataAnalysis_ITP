		<title>19 A POLICE VISIT</title>
		<content>    On Friday July 12th the local      
 policemen came to the school for us to
 ask them some questions.              
    When they were asked what was the  
 most common crime in Carmarthen they  
 answered shoplifting,and when we asked
 how many murders there were none.     
   One said that he had been           
 hurt in August 1985 whilst chasing    
 after a boy.                          
    They said it was fun being a       
 policeman in Carmarthen even though   
 there is much more vandalism.         
    When asked how many burglaries per 
 year in Carmarthen they said about 100
 a year there are about 10-50 per week.
    When they were asked what was the  
 most serious crime in Carmarthen since
 the 80s they said arson,assaults and  
 burglaries. They also said there had  
 been a great increase in younger      
 children getting caught for crimes.PTO</content>
