		<title>10CORSTON GUEST HOUSE</title>
		<content> This house is owned by Frederick Hiams
 Ltd, and is leased by Mr. and Mrs.    
 Dorman. It is an 18th century Georgian
 Manor House with beds, food and drink.
 When full it caters for 36 people. On 
 winter evenings the  bar has about 6  
 to 30 customers and the Guest House is
 used by about 6 to 10. In summer the  
 Guest House is nearly full and the bar
 has 40 to 50 customers. In winter the 
 Dormans work on their own but in      
 summer they take on extra staff, 2    
 full and 2 part-time. The best months 
 are July and August, with September   
 fairly good, but November to February 
 is a quiet time. Locals support the   
 bar all year round, with tourists     
 needing bar meals and drinks in       
 summer. Residents use a pool-table, a 
 jukebox and arcade games. There is a  
 piano and organ for special occasions.
