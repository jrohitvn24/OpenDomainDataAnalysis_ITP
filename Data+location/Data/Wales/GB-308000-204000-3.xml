 Fochriw was once a mining village with
 two pits,Fochriw Pit and South Tunnel 
 Pit.These areas have been landscaped  
 by the National Coal Board.A large    
 area of land between Rhymney and      
 Pontlottyn has been landscaped and a  
 new road put in bypassing Rhymney.    
 It was built on the site of a small   
 pit,Rhymney Ironworks and Barracks    
 Level.There is still a washery for the
 open cast mine at Cwm Bargoed.At the  
 village of Pentwyn Mr Llewellyn and   
 his employees still work a level.By   
 the feeder pond above Fochriw there is
 a second level worked by Mr Rowe.The  
 Hymac Factory in Rhymney is not being 
 used at present because it went out of
 business in 1983.
