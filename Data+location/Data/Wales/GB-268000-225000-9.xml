		<title>09My Impression of Our Area</title>
		<content> When I first came to Bethlehem just   
 over a year ago I thought it was very 
 quiet compared to the city of Cardiff 
 where I used to live.My mother wanted 
 to move here because she was born in a
 small village nearby called Llanwrda. 
 In Bethlehem there are far more       
 animals and wildlife,I see many birds 
 of prey here such as the Red Kite,Owls
 and Buzzards.In the countryside there 
 are wore woodlands of decidious and   
 coniferous trees with large fields and
 hedges,It is a good place for keeping 
 dogs.My home,Talar Wen has a small    
 wood with many flowers growing on the 
 woodland floor.Animals that I see     
 regulory are squirrels, hedgehogs,    
 various birds of prey, foxes and      
 rabbits.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
