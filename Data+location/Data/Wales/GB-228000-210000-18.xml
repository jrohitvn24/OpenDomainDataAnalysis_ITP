		<title>18FADS AND FUN IN LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> Fashion in clothes and hair styles is 
 very modified even with the younger   
 generation. Eating out is a little    
 more popular these days as is social  
 drinking.  Weekly bingo, in aid of the
 Memorial Hall, is popular.  Sessions  
 also attended in Tenby, by special    
 bus.  There are 'fruit machines' in   
 pubs and clubs and football pools but 
 the betting shop is now closed.  A few
 take holidays abroad, more stay with  
 relatives or friends in Britain.      
 Visiting Garden Centres and Sunday    
 markets are other increasing pastimes.
 There is a small recorder-playing     
 group of WI members and a large       
 amateur dramatic group "Laugharne     
 Players", who produce a musical and   
 variety show or pantomime annually.   
 Professional wrestlers, Choirs and    
 Theatre Groups also visit us. Cinema, 
 theatre or disco 30-100 miles away.   </content>
