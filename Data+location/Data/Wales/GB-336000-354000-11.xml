		<content> In the Rofft School we did a survey   
 to find out what jobs people in the   
 area of Marford had.We went round the 
 junior classes and asked the children 
 what jobs their mother and father had.
 We found that none out of about two - 
 hundred parents were unemployed.We    
 found that there were more housewives 
 in the area than any that worked in   
 Marford or Chester.We also found that 
 most people worked out of Marford and 
 in Wrexham.The results were people who
 worked out of Marford sixty three;    
 people who work in Wrexham sixty one; 
 people who are housewives forty six;  
 people who work in Chester twenty     
 two;people who work in Marford twelve.
