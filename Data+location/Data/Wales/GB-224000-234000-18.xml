		<content> There are two chapels and two churches
 in our block.One church,Cilrhedyn     
 Church is a ruin.Clydau and Cilrhedyn 
 are both Anglican churches.They are   
 both Celtic churches with circular    
 graveyards and are about 1500 years   
 old.There are two other chapels.      
 Llwyndrain Chapel which is            
 Congregationalist and Star which is a 
 Baptist Chapel.I do not go to church  
 but I used to go to Sunday School.I   
 left because I did not like it.The    
 three ogham stones inside Clydau      
 Church are gravestones of Irish       
 noblemen who lived in our area in the 
 5th to 7th centuries.One of the stones
 was found on Dygoed Farm,my home.In   
 1829,a preacher named David Wilcock   
 was walking down the hill to Star by  
 Nant Ifan-fawr when he saw a shooting 
 star land on some rocks above the     
 village and he built his chapel there.</content>
