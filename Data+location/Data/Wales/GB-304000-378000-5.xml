		<content>  Ghost Canyon is to be found in the   
 disused Graig Fach quarry where       
 Dyserth Castle once stood.It is       
 believed that every full moon,the     
 sound of a man and his dog could be   
 heard-but never seen.                 
  Another legend is associated with    
 the ancient remains found on Moel     
 Hiraddug.An old witch was thought to  
 come down from the mountain,once a    
 month to look for something or        
 somebody from Dyserth to take back to 
 her cave.                             
  Three boys from Ysgol Hiraddug       
 believe that they saw a ghost         
 whilst playing one evening.They       
 discribed it as a white figure which  
 had a head or something under its arm.
 It was seen walking across the old    
 Dyserth railway track near Graig Fach 
 disused quarry.
