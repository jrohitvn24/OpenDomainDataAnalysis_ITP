		<title>17Inustry around Rhos</title>
		<content> In the past inustry has largely       
 depended upon the natural resources of
 the area such as coal and clay.Coal   
 mining is exausted in this area       
 although some residents still work at 
 the nearby Bersham Colliery           
    Clay however still supports a      
 thriving and continually developing   
 industry.In the south eastern part of 
 our area massive deposits of clay have
 been found.This clay is suitable for  
 making tiles.The clay is up using big 
 machines and is transported to the    
 nearby tile works.The tile works      
 opened 109 years ago and have been    
 extesivly modernised.About 150 people 
 are enployed at the works which       
 produces 100000 floor tiles a day.    
    When clay comes from the claypit it
 is ground up and then remixed before  
 being forced through a narrow slit    
 onto a conveyor belt.                 </content>
