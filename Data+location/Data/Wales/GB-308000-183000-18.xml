		<title>18CARING FOR THE COMMUNITY 1</title>
		<content> For several years local government has
 been forced to reduce spending on     
 services. This has led to the         
 curtailment of existing services and  
 often the abandonment of planned new  
 ones. At the same time, central       
 government has utilised a portion of  
 the unemployed by creating Community  
 Projects to provide social services to
 the community on which they are based 
 - albeit on a different level and of a
 different nature.                     
 Taffs Well Community Enterprise Unit  
 sponsor such a scheme in this area.   
 Seventy people who have been          
 unemployed for between 6 and 12 months
 are given mainly part time jobs for a 
 maximum period of 12 months and paid  
 roughly double the current minimum    
 unemployment benefit. Wages are paid  
 by the government.                    
                                       </content>
