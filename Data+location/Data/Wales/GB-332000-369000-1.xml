		<content> Our area consists of three main       
 places.The largest being              
 Sealand,consisting of the new village 
 of Garden City,and also the large land
 area of the Royal Air Force camp at   
 Sealand.The oldest part is that of    
 Shotwick and its very old church      
 dating back to Domesday times.Our area
 also includes a very small part of the
 village of Saughall.Our area is very  
 flat,if anything it is in a very      
 shallow valley,that valley being the  
 old river bed of the wide River Dee,it
 is the tract which the River Dee      
 Company in the second half of the     
 eighteenth century reclaimed or       
 redeemed when it cut a new channel for
 the River Dee,and erected in          
 embankment in order to improve the    
 navigation of the{Dee Estuary so that 
 shipping could still go up as far as  
 the very old city of Chester.         </content>
