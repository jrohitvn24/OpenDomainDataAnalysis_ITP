		<title>17HAWARDEN CASTLE</title>
		<content> The hill on which the castle stands   
 forms a stronghold jutting out towards
 the Dee estuary in the south          
 east.Hawarden was the Northern gateway
 into Wales,the Romans must have       
 travelled this way into north Wales.  
 The hill is known to hav4 been used as
 a Welsh fortress during the centuries 
 of the Roman occupation.It was        
 captured when the Saxons invaded many 
 centuries later. The Welsh name       
 Penerlag means "the head of the       
 marsh".The Saxon name of Hawarden or  
 Hawardyn means "the high enclosure",  
 it is found in the Doomsday Book of   
 1086.The Saxons built a timber        
 structure on top of the mound and     
 defendedthe slopes with wooden fences.
 At the time of the Norman invasion the
 area was in the possession of Edwin of
 Mercia.After the invasion the land was
 granted to Hugh Lupus Earl of Chester.</content>
