		<content> COMMUNITY GROUPS IN THE BARGOED AREA. 
 The folk of the mining communities of 
 South Wales have a tradition of active
 involvement in community life. This is
 due, to a large extent, to the        
 hardships which these communities     
 suffered during the depression years  
 of this century. The town of Bargoed  
 has long been regarded as a focal     
 point for the upper Rhymney Valley in 
 terms of transport, shopping, business
 and, until recently , employment. This
 has inevitably led to Bargoed being   
 also an important centre of community 
 /social life. In the town there are   
 Brownies, Guides, Cubs, Scouts, Boys/ 
 Girls Brigades, Army Cadets, Weight   
 Watchers, Play Groups, Red Cross,     
 Salvation Army, Camera, Model Railway 
 and Youth Clubs, Charity Groups,      
 O.A.P.s and, typical of the area Male 
 Voice Choir and political parties.    </content>
