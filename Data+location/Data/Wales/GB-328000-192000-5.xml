		<title>05 Housing in the Cwmbran Area</title>
		<content>   Since Cwmbran is a new town there   
 are many different styles of house.   
 Much of the housing in Cwmbran is     
 owned by the Developement Corporation,
 and is rented to the occupiers. These 
 are mainly two- and three-bedroom     
 houses and blocks of flats.           
   Half of the children at Brookfield  
 School live in new development and the
 other half live in the older houses of
 the old village of Cwmbran.           
                                       
   My Village by Matthew &amp; Jason       
   -----------------------------       
   My village is shrinking because it  
 is beng swallowed-up by surrounding   
 new development. It is split by a new 
 road which has also destroyed our     
 canal. Shops are closing and moving   
 out to more modern accomodation.      
   I fear that my village has been     
 sentenced to death.                   </content>
