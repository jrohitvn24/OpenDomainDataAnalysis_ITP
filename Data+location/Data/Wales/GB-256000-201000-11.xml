		<title>11Old Customs-Children's Games</title>
		<content> Before the era of the car children    
 played on the roads and in the        
 streets. There were rings or circles  
 of various sizes in every part of the 
 road where children played marbles.   
 Squares were clearly marked for girls 
 to play hop scotch. The game could go 
 on for hours without fear of          
 interruption and even if disturbed it 
 would only be for a while so that the 
 milk cart or coal cart could pass.    
 Children used to play on their way to 
 and from school. All children at that 
 time walked to school every day. Some 
 would walk four or five miles each    
 way. It was not unusual for some      
 children who lived in the remote parts
 of the village to have tea with their 
 friends and then play well into the   
 night before going home in safety.
