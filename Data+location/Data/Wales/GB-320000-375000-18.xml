		<title>18EFFECTS OF THE RECESSION</title>
		<content> The closing of all the numerous,local,
 lead works,collieries,some local shops
 the paper mill,Courtaulds at Flint has
 had a devasting effect on Bagillt.This
 and no new jobs being created in the  
 area has had a depressing effect on   
 the local population.A very high      
 percentage of the local inhabitants   
 are unemployed and have been for some 
 considerable time.Because of their age
 they are unlikely to secure           
 employment.Many families do not travel
 very far afield due to the expense    
 involved.Using public transport is too
 expensive.They can not afford to run  
 their own car.Some belong to large    
 families.Many local people feel quite 
 depressed at such prospects.A         
 considerable time is spent watching   
 television and socialising in the     
 local public houses.Many attend Bingo 
 2/3 times a week locally.             </content>
