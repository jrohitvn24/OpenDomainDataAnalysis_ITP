		<title>18Shopping Survey - Background</title>
		<content> Apart from the Sub-Post Office, which 
 is not a general stores, there is no  
 shop in Garway. There was one in the  
 past, and people did not often travel 
 elsewhere to shop, but today it is    
 almost essential to have a car and a  
 freezer if you live in Garway.        
       Hereford is 12 miles north of   
 the village; Monmouth is 7.5 miles SE,
 Ross-on-Wye is 10 miles E, and        
 Abergavenny 11 miles SW. There are    
 village stores at Skenfrith (2.5      
 miles) and St. Weonards (3 miles).    
       Our survey asked people where   
 they went shopping, and how often. We 
 asked specifically about the four     
 named towns, and people also mentioned
 the following, all of which are within
 about an hour's car journey: Newport, 
 Cardiff, Cwmbran, Bristol, Gloucester,
 Cheltenham, Worcester, Leominster.
