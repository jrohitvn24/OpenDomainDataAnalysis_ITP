		<content> The Senior Citizens of Caldicot are   
 well looked after. Many of them live  
 in bungalows on a complex attended by 
 wardens. This means that they have    
 their independence and also the       
 companionship of their friends. There 
 are two complexes at Wiesental Close  
 and Margaret's Way and a residential  
 home at Brookside.                    
    In Sandy Lane there is a Senior    
 Citizens Day Luncheon Centre where hot
 meals are served three days a week. A 
 similar service is available at the   
 Leisure Centre.                       
    The elderly also use the Leisure   
 Centre for social events  such as     
 Bingo.                                
    For house-bound people there is a  
 'meals on wheels' service on Mondays  
 and Wednesdays.
