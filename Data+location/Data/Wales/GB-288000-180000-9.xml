		<content> The school was officialy opened in    
 1900 by the Lord of Dunraven as an    
 intermediate school. The buildings are
 made of brick, sandstone, wood with   
 pitch and slate roofing. Our school is
 on a piece of land 3276 sqm. It has a 
 variety of trees around the perimeter.
 The children use a variety of         
 equipment to help them learn. The most
 important are the video, television,  
 computer, hi-fi and photocopier.      
 During lunchtime and after school     
 children are involved in a variety of 
 clubs. Adult societies use the school 
 in the evenings. The children study   
 many subjects from science to art.    
 Some are included in project work.    
 Each class completes 3 projects a     
 year.
