		<content> A mainly unpopulated rural area, with 
 a nuclear power station dominating it.
 This is cooled by water from the      
 man-made lake which covers most of    
 this block.  The land cover also      
 includes scrub oak, moorland and some 
 afforestation.  A small part of the   
 NW is protected land because of a rare
 species of heathland bush.  There is a
 Roman fort, surmounted by a           
 motte-&amp;-bailey on the NE.  It is very 
 poor agricultural land, mainly used   
 for sheep farming.  The lake is       
 stocked with trout and provides good  
 fishing, as it also contains coarse   
 fish.  It is attractive country       
 visited by tourists in holiday        
 cottages, and a few caravans and      
 tents.  There is very little public   
 transport.  In spite of the altitude -
 approximately 750 feet - the weather  
 is generally mild.                    </content>
