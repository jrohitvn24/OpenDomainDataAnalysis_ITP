		<content>         The Bailey Hill_Garth area is 
 hilly land in the middle Welsh Border 
 Country. Situated, west of Knighton,  
 in the County of Powys. The area is in
  the parishes of Knighton, Pilleth,   
 Llangunllo and Heyope. There are no   
  villages and it is sparsley populated
 except for the south eastern corner   
 which is the north western fringe     
 of Knighton. There are 14 farms,one   
 larger house, Gwernaffel, a few       
 cottages and some newer dwellings. One
 farm house is fairly new, replacing an
 older building. The houses on the edge
 Knighton are all of recent            
 construction. Garth Hill rises to     
 320m. and the highest point on Bailey 
 Hill, which is most of the area, is   
 393m. The land is good pasture and    
 produces good sheep and beef cattle.  
 There are some wooded areas, both     
 decidious and coniferous.             </content>
