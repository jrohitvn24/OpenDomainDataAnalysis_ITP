		<title>02ROUTINE AT MOELFRE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> School begins at 9am and ends at      
 3.30pm. When the automatic bell rings 
 at 9am, the teachers mark the         
 registers and collect dinner money.   
 Assembly is in the music room. We also
 say prayers before dinner and at home 
 time. We have three playtimes,        
 10.35am-10.50am, 12.15pm-1.15pm,      
 2.30pm-2.40pm.                        
     There are about 130 children , six
 teachers. There are three teaching    
 areas with two classes in each. Each  
 area has reading areas and areas for  
 practical work. In the hall we have   
 gym, dinner, and concerts. We have a  
 music room for music and television.  
      It is a Community School and has 
 a public library, a day-care centre   
 for the elderly and a voluntary       
 nursery school.
