		<title>01Eglwysbach-General Review</title>
		<content> Eglwysbach is a small village in the  
 Conwy Valley in Gwynedd. To the north,
 the nearest big town is Llandudno     
 whilst to the south, there is the     
 small town of Llanrwst. The village   
 itself is in the valleys of the Rivers
 Hiraethlyn and Carrog. After the Ice  
 Age the valleys were occupied by a    
 glacial lake which later drained into 
 the Conwy River. About 1000 people    
 live in the village. Until 1945 most  
 of the villagers were Welsh-speaking  
 but today the population is equally   
 divided between Welsh and English     
 speaking. Today it is a dormatory     
 village, with many people travelling  
 to Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Llandudno
 Junction, and dominated by farming.   
 The biggest landowner is the Bodnant  
 Estate. Many thousands visit the      
 famous Bodnant Gardens. Many farms are
 over 400 years old.                   </content>
