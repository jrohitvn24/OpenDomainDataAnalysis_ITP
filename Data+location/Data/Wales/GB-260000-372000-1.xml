		<content> In this area most of the land is used 
 as pasture for sheep and cattle, with 
 two fields set aside for crops,       
 (barley). This area of land is flat,  
 being on the coastal plain, with a    
 footpath access to the foreshore. From
 here there are fine views across to   
 Anglesey whilst at low tide the mud   
 flats known as{Traeth Lavan}offers a  
 fine feeding ground for many types of 
 birds.                                
                                       
 The westernmost kilometer square is   
 within the grounds of{Penrhyn castle  
 and consists of parkland and woodland.
 Part of this area is owned by the     
 national trust along with Penrhyn     
 castle in the adjoining block.        
                                       
 In square 6172 there is a small nature
 reserve, called the{Spinneys,}managed 
 by the{N.Wales naturalists trust.     </content>
