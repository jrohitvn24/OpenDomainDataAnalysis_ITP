		<title>02THE RIVER CLEDDAU</title>
		<content> The River Cleddau opens out into      
 Milford Haven just downstream from    
 this block.It is tidal at this        
 point.There is also a creek known     
 as Cosheston Pill that branches off   
 the River and leads to the village of 
 Cosheston.                            
   At low tide,most ofthe creek is just
 an expanse of mud.Part of the creek   
 provides mooring for yachts and small 
 boats and there are also Navy floating
 targets and a target ship that are    
 towed out to sea for Navy and R.A.F   
 practice firing. There are Naval      
 jetties on both sides of the River (at
 Burton and near Pembroke Ferry).      
   The water and mud is home for many  
 birds and heron, cormorants, shelduck 
 as well as herring gulls, blackbacked 
 and blackheaded gulls are very common.
 River trips are popular with tourists.
