		<content> Ysgol Glan Morfa is an Infant and     
 Junior School for children from       
 Abergele and the surrounding district 
 whose first language is Welsh.  There 
 are 125 pupils with 5 full time       
 teachers, 1 part-time teacher and 2   
 nursery assistants.  This new building
 was opened in 1957 and the head       
 teacher's name is Mr. J. E. Hughes.   
 The school day begins at 8.55 am and  
 ends at 3.15 pm (3.00 pm for Infants).
 Children from outside Abergele are    
 brought in and returned home by a     
 private bus daily.  The school uniform
 is blue and grey. School meals are    
 supplied from the Infants' School     
 kitchen which is on the same site.    
 The site is also shared with St.      
 Elfod's Junior School.                
 At 11 years the children transfer to  
 Ysgol y Creuddyn, the new Welsh       
 language High School at Penrhyn Bay.  </content>
