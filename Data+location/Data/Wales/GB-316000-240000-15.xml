 centuries the property of the Vaughans
 who also owned 8 messuages, 8 gardens,
 1 water corn grist mill, 300acres of  
 woodland in Glasbury, Llowes,and      
 Boughrood.The Castle was largely      
 demolished in 1951.A part was repaired
 and preserved to make a reasonably    
 sized house in which the DeWinton     
 family now live.They have 10 usable   
 rooms these are split up into 3 flats,
 one for the Major and his wife,one for
 his son and one for his daughter when 
 she visits.Their central heating was  
 gas made in the gas house.They have 1 
 cleaner,an outdoor swimming pool and  
 an ornamental garden where part of the
 old house used to be.There are about  
 ten houses on the estate all occupied
