		<title>12PEN-Y-WERN FARM GOYTRE</title>
		<content>   My farm covers{110 acres }and is    
 mainly grassland.We grow no crops so  
 we have to make our living entirely   
 out of{livestock.}On the farm we keep 
 pigs,cows,horses,geese,cats and       
 dogs.We make our living from the      
 pigs,cows and geese and keep the other
 animals just for fun.We have to feed  
 all the animals and clean out the pig 
 stys regulary.In the winter we have to
 feed the cattle with hay.I help with  
 the feeding and also help to weigh the
 pigs on the scales to see if they are 
 ready for market. I travel to school  
 by{mini-bus}which picks me up in the  
 farmyard.My sister and I enjoy        
 travelling to school with our friends.
 In the evenings I sometimes ride on my
 bike to the village green or play on  
 the farm.I enjoy climbing up on to the
 farmsheds and looking around the farm.
