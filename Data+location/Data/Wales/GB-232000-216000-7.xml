		<content> In our area is a small family run     
 hotel which has accommodation for 25  
 and can cater for 180 in its large    
 function room.The hotel was originally
 a farm which was converted first into 
 a guest house and later a hotel.During
 the summer,most of the visitors are   
 tourists who visit the superb west    
 wales beaches.Many of the visitors are
 foreign.During the winter most        
 visitors are buisness people.The hotel
 has only one full time staff but      
 employs six part time workers.The     
 hotels busiest time is between October
 and April.The hotel is popular for    
 parties and wedding receptions some of
 which are booked up to 2 years ahead. 
 The most popular meal served at the   
 hotel is a turkey dinner.The new      
 by-pass has made no differance to the 
 party trade but the bed and breakfast 
 trade has been affected.              </content>
