		<title>18LOCAL HISTORY IN WELSHPOOL</title>
		<content>{The Welshpool Cockpit}stands off New  
 Street behind the National Westminster
 Bank which was once the site of the   
 Castle Inn. The site of the cockpit   
 was known as Bloody Field, the scene  
 of a fatal duel over a cockfight. The 
 cockpit, which is assumed to have been
 built in the eighteenth century, is   
 hexagonal in plan and built of brick  
 with a slate roof.                    
 Usually the ordinary people stood     
 around the cockpit on the cobbled yard
 floor whilst the more important stood 
 in the gallery above. However in      
 Welshpool this is not the case as the 
 pit was on the upper floor.           
 The building was officially used as a 
 cockpit until the sport was made      
 illegal in 1849. It has now been fully
 restored to its original condition.
