		<content>    During the morning at school I have
 a swimming lesson, I recently passed  
 my Bronze medallion for survival      
 swimming. Later on in the morning we  
 have a maths lesson and I work hard at
 mental maths work. At 12.15pm we have 
 our lunch hour and the children have  
 either sandwiches or a school meal.   
   After lunch my mother writes out the
 theatre list for Mr.Jones,the surgeon.
 The list contains the name of the     
 patient, the time of the operation,   
 what they are having done, and the    
 number of the operating theatre.      
   Afternoons in school can include    
 guitar lessons, games, computer work  
 or art work. School finishes at 3.30pm
 and I walk home and let out Penny our 
 dog. Mum arrives home at 5.15pm.      
   I usually watch T.V. until mum comes
 home, I then have tea and go to bed at
 9.15pm.{Written by Paul Herring.      </content>
