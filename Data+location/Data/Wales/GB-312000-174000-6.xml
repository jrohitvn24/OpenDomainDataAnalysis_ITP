		<content> Yesterday we went to St.Marys church, 
 we went up there at half past one.We  
 went in a mini bus to look at the area
 we are working on,also we went there  
 to see what it looked like.It is very 
 very old but now it looks a shambles.I
 wish they had kept it beautiful and   
 neat instead of destroying it and     
 wrecking it,I am also angry about the 
 litter there.What we had to do is     
 write down all the names of the people
 buried there.We also made rubbings of 
 the gravestones and trees.We also     
 found out how old the people were.The 
 oldest I saw was 77 years old and the 
 youngest 1 year old the grave was     
 tiny. I am very sad. We collected wild
 flowers. There were; cowslips,        
 bluebells, buttercups, dandelions and 
 most popular of all, daisies.
