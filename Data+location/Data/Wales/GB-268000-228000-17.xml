		<title>17RIVERS AND FISHING</title>
		<content> Fishing is a popular pastime in the   
 Llangadog area because many streams   
 and rivers run through our "D" block. 
 The River Towy is the largest river,  
 and three of its tributaries,the      
 Rivers Bran,Sawdde and Marlais flow   
 into it in this area.The rivers are   
 very clean and fishermen often catch  
 salmon,sewin and trout.They also catch
 lampreys and eels.The Llangadog       
 Angling Association owns some of the  
 fishing rights in the area,but much of
 it is owned by Associations from far  
 away.Since the Llyn Brianne Dam was   
 built in the upper reaches of the Towy
 about ten years ago,fishermen have    
 complained that there are not so many 
 fish in the river.Wild life seen on   
 and near the rivers recently include  
 otters,swans and kingfishers.
