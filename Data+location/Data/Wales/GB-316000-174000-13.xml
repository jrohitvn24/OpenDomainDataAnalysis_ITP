  Baseball very simply consists of two 
 sides of eleven players.The object of 
 the game is to make progress around   
 four bases,scoring one to four runs in
 the process.The rules are more complex
 but the side which scores the most    
 runs wins.                            
  Despite attempts to spread the game, 
 Baseball is only played in Cardiff,   
 Newport and Liverpool.                
  Grangetown is said to be the home of 
 Baseball,having produced great sides  
 of the past.Today the game still      
 thrives,with children and adults      
 taking part.At{Sevenoaks Park         
{(172/752)}on a Summer's evening,it is 
 common to have four games taking      
 place,with many families sitting      
 around the "diamonds" (pitches)       
 enjoying the sport.                   </content>
