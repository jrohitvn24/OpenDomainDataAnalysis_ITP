		<title>16FARM SURVEYS AT NANTGLYN 1</title>
		<content>    Sheep farming is the main          
 occupation.The farm studied was on    
 steep land its valley sides rising    
 from the flat land near the River     
 Ystrad at 150m.to the highest land at 
 220m.Out of 55h.improved pasture      
 filled 30 with 10h.of ley pasture for 
 hay and silage.The steep slopes had   
 deciduous wood with rough pasture     
 where sheep could still graze.There   
 was a small new amenity woodland.No   
 arable land, although the previous    
 owner had good barley crops.          
    There were 350 ewes, mostly Welsh  
 half breeds or Beulah. The sheep were 
 out all year, lowland wintering was   
 not needed, the farm did not often get
 snow bound.Sheep sometimes came in for
 lambing.In summer 60 young dairy      
 cows were fed on the better pasture.  
    The land was classed as marginal so
 the EEC sheep subsidy was recieved.   </content>
