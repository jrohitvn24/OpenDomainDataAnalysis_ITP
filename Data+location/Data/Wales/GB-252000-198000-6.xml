		<content> ADULT'S LEISURE ACTIVITIES by Joanne  
 aged 11:When my mother comes home she 
 makes food for all the family.When we 
 have eaten she washes the dishes and  
 goes into the living room.In her spare
 time she watches T.V. and reads       
 books.Sometimes she is afraid to read 
 alone because she likes reading books 
 like "Dracula" or "Haunted House".    
 When my father comes home my mother   
 makes food for him then he goes out   
 to the garden and does some gardening 
 which he enjoys.Whenever he sees a    
 garden he goes up to it and always    
 does something to it.He also builds   
 grates and Knocks walls down in my    
 house.My favourite hobby is making    
 cakes and washing my socks.I also like
 gardening because my father helps me.
