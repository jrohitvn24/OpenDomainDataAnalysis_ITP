		<title>10Farming - Beef</title>
		<content> This area is not a typical            
 agricultural one.  The farms vary     
 considerably in size from 300 acres   
 (Hendrelas) ranging down to 5 or 10   
 acres.  All are hill farms and some   
 have mountain grazing rights on March 
 Hywel Mountain, with the family       
 working the land.  On the smaller     
 holdings, the owner or occupier will  
 also have another job.  Some farms    
 date back over 300 years and in 1 Bryn
 Brych, the same family have occupied  
 it for over 100 years.  With 2        
 exceptions, all the farms concentrate 
 on beef but some also rear sheep.     
 Calves, reared from herds of cows kept
 for this purpose are sometimes        
 purchased at a few weeks old from     
 local markets.  The main breeds are   
 Welsh Black, British Freisian,        
 Charlois, Limousin, Hereford and      
 Simmintal.                            </content>
