		<title>14SOCIAL CARE IN AMMANFORD</title>
		<content>  The Amman Valley has a growing       
 population and the majority are       
 elderly or very young.                
  Four dentists and seven doctors serve
 the community. Indeed, there is such a
 great demand for treatment that a     
 second brand new surgery is to be     
 built in Ammanford shortly.           
  A health clinic has been opened in   
 the old Secondary Modern school,      
 offering ante and post natal classes, 
 baby clinics and family planning      
 advice to the community. An estimated 
 300 people seek help and advice at the
 clinic each week.                     
  The elderly are also cared for. The  
 area has a home for the aged at Tegfan
 and two separate sheltered-homes sites
 in the village of Tirdail, alone.     
 "Cartref" is a day centre for the     
 elderly. A meals on wheals sevice is  
 also run on a volunteer basis.        </content>
