     The area around our school is a   
 mixture of farm land and residential  
 areas.There are lots of private       
 housing estates - Hunters Chase The   
 Rise etc. Some of these houses are    
 Summer homes as lots of visitors come 
 to the area.There are quite a few     
 caravan parks - Trearddur Farm ,      
 Gwynfair , Bagnall etc.Lots of people 
 stay in hotels - The Beach , The      
 Trearddur Bay , The Seacroft etc.     
    Our area is very busy in Summer but
 is much quieter in Winter.Lots of the 
 residents are retired people and the  
 other residents work in Holyhead.Most 
 householders have their own cars. The 
 farms grow crops - wheat , barley etc 
 and keep animals - cows , sheep       
 etc.Lots of the farmland is owned by  
 Anglesey Aluminium who have a large   
 plant near the area                   </content>
