 Children would play in the middle of  
 the street because of the lack of     
 traffic.The year 1945 saw the begining
 of the Youth Clubs and in the summer  
 they organized camps by the sea that  
 you could visit.                      
                                       
 Q.What food did they eat?             
      I never had any Oranges, Bananas,
 Grapes or any other imported fruits   
 till about six months after the war   
 when a few Bananas came through.      
 Oranges also filtered through. The    
 only people who had them were pregnant
 women with green ration cards. Mothers
 were also allowed extra sugar ration  
 for making jams. No icecream sometimes
 there was frozen fruit juices on      
 sticks. Chicken was considered a      
 luxury.                               </content>
