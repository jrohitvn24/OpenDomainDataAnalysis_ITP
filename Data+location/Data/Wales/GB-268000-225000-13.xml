		<title>13The Calender life of a Farm</title>
		<content> In the{summer months}my father who is 
 a{farmer}starts making{silage.}Making 
 silage is a busy job,tractors with    
 trailers come whizzing into the yard  
 revers into the shed to unload the    
 trailer.My{father}then buckrakes the  
 load into the back of the shed and    
 then waits for the load.During the    
{autumn}my father prepares for the     
{winter.}He makes sure there is plenty 
 of food for the{animals}to eat like   
{straw,cow-cake,silage}and{hay.}He has 
 to change the cows  bedding when it   
 gets muddy.In the{winter}it is hard to
 get the cows into the milking cubicals
 because they keep on slipping on the  
 ice.When we put{silage}out the tractor
 keeps on slipping.It was a difficult  
 job because we could not go up the    
 drive.In the{spring}cows give birth to
 thier young.The{calf}is coverd in     
 slime when it is born.                </content>
