 last war(39-45) and was opened in 1942
 by Mr. Clement Davies th well known   
 Liberal M.P. that lived locally. The  
 school is situated in a spacious and  
 well designed campus,sited between the
 lower part of the village and the     
 private and council estates to the    
 North.                                
 It is sited in the broad valley of    
 Meifod and is overlooked by the       
 Dyffryn Hill and the higher escarpment
 between the valley and Llanfyllin.    
 The general area is one of exceptional
 beauty on the A495 between Oswestry   
 and the Cardiganshire Coast.          
 It holds, at the moment, some 55      
 pupils and these children are taught  
 by the Headteacher, Mr. D. Gareth     
 Jenkins and Mrs. Delyth A. Evans,     
 Infant Mistress.
