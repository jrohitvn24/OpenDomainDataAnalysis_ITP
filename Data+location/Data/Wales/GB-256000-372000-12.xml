		<title>12The games children play.</title>
		<content>    Children play chasing games,       
 variations of hide and seek,  ball    
 games, skipping etc.                  
    One is called elastics. You tie    
 together the ends of a long piece of a
 elastic. Two children stand inside and
 stretch the elastic into an oblong    
 with their legs. Then those outside   
 have a turn to do a series of jumps   
 with the elastic stretched wide or    
 allowed near together, held low around
 the ankles or higher around knees or  
 thighs.                               
    If you make a mistake by not doing 
 the correct order of jumps, standing  
 or not standing when you should etc,  
 someone else has a turn at jumping and
 you hold an "end"  of the elastic.    
    When your turn comes round again   
 you carry on from where you left off. 
 The winner is the person who is most  
 far ahead in the jumps.               </content>
