		<title>08Traffic In Heolgerrig</title>
		<content>   Difficulties are experienced by     
 drivers using the Heolgerrig road to  
 and from Merthyr.The narrow road      
 through the village,on which cars are 
 parked continually due to insufficient
 garages and parking spaces is always  
 busy.                                 
   Our class surveyed Heolgerrig and   
 found out that there were 666 private 
 cars approximately,through-out the    
 village.                              
   A survey of the average number of   
 passengers using the local bus through
 one day going to and from town,was 9  
 to 10 people.The highest number of    
 passengers was 19 and the lowest was  
 1.                                    
   Large vehicles such as buses and    
 lorries find it difficult to travel   
 through the village,especially at busy
 times when people are going out in the
 mornings and coming home from work.   </content>
