 pottery and an Art Gallery. The       
 village is situated around a dangerous
 sharp corner in a small dip. There are
 the remains of a{mine.}A red brick    
 chimney still remains. Tankerville is 
 an old street, it's about a hundred   
 years old. It has bits of remains of  
 houses. There is an old pond with lots
 of frogs. If you look down from the   
 cliff or hill you can see the whole   
 village. The{gallery,}run by Mr Fred  
 Hollands, as well as offering for sale
 pictures of the local area, also      
 teaches art to interested local       
 people. The{pottery}is a cottage      
 industry and its products are sold    
 on site through a small shop.         
 There is a very pleasant{walk}up      
 alongside the Pottery, to a small     
 waterfall,an ideal place for lunch.
