		<content> Girls played hopscotch and spinning   
 tops in their long skirts,covered by  
 frilled white aprons.                 
 The land around the harbour was       
 grassland and there were only 50-100  
 visitors who stayed in "apartments".  
 These were rooms in private houses    
 and the landlady cooked food provided 
 by the guests.                        
 We got the impression from these      
 elderly people that whilst they       
 appreciated the improvement in the    
 standard of living,there was an       
 overall sadness that many of the old  
 values seemed to have been lost.
