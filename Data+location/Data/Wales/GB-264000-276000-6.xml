		<content> We are a family of three who moved to 
 the area from England several years   
 ago. We bought a small farmhouse in   
 Pantycrug &amp; converted one of the      
 outbuildings to a television workshop 
 &amp; started a small TV sales/repairs    
 business covering a 15 mile radius.   
 Our son went to English speaking      
 school in Aberystwyth &amp; now studies   
 computer science at Loughborough      
 University. Our pastimes are walking, 
 photography, sport, gardening &amp; Womens
 Institute. Our son shares most of our 
 interests &amp; also enjoys cycling.      
 The{travelling shop}calls once a week 
 in Llanfihangel &amp; along the main road 
 from Pisgah to Capel Seion. The{      
{milkman}calls every other day &amp; the   
 baker 3 times a week. A butcher calls 
 at Llanfihangel once a week aswell.   
 The nearest shop for both communities 
 is at New Cross.                      </content>
