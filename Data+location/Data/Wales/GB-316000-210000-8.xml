 This house was connected with the     
 local iron works.They were opened in  
 1795 and were later bought by Crawshay
 and Joseph Bailey.By 1825 they had a  
 worldwide reputation especially for   
 the making of railways.In 1833 a new  
 plate mill was built.Nantyglo became  
 one of the most important iron        
 producing works in the world.         
  Crawshay Bailey built a house called 
 Ty Mawr.It was surrounded by trees and
 gardens.Running through the garden was
 a mountain stream crossed by a stone  
 bridge for the coach to go over.The   
 stables are still visible.Joseph      
 Bailey left the house in 1830 and     
 retired to Glan Usk.Crawshay died in  
 1872.The Blaina Iron and Coal Company 
 took it over.It fell into a ruined    
 state during the twentieth century but
 is now being excavated for posterity. </content>
