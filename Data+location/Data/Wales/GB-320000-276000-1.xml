		<title>01TYPE OF AREA</title>
		<content> This is a remote and very hilly region
 ideal for walking, rough shooting etc.
 The bare grassy hills are deeply      
 intersected by narrow valleys, usually
 with a fast-flowing stream down to the
 River Teme.The valleys are well wooded
 mostly with deciduous trees and the   
 bird life is prolific, with game birds
 reared for sport.Badgers make their   
 home in the area, and there are       
 considerable numbers of foxes.        
   The land is nearly all intensively  
 managed grassland, and is used for    
 pasture,hay,grass and silage.The      
 highest hill rises to 1248ft.         
   The farms and homesteads are remote 
 and widely scattered.They are all     
 family units.                         
   The River Teme in its upper reaches 
 runs through the valley and for the   
 most part forms the boundary between  
 England and Wales.                    </content>
