		<title>14Trade - Local Shops</title>
		<content>  There are only 15 shops open in      
 Cwmfelinfach.Before the mine closed in
 1964 there were 33! The village is now
 without a chemist or a bank although  
 the Sub Post Office is stil open.Most 
 of the shops still in business are    
 small family run businesses employing 
 2 or 3 people.The people in them are  
 friendly and talkative.All the        
 shopkeepers said that their trade was 
 affected by large hyper markets,Asda, 
 Carrefour and Leos open a few km.     
 away.                                 
     The local stores are used mainly  
 by old people and those unable to     
 travel to the large Superstores.      
     My family use the newsagents for  
 papers and comics,we seldom use the   
 other shops Mum says they are too     
 dear.Occasionally we use the fish shop
 especially if they have had a long    
 night in the club or pub.             </content>
