		<content>   In the mornings I wake up at 7.25   
 a.m. and it is a bit hard to get up.  
 At breakfast I have tea and toast. I  
 make it myself and I eat it with my   
 brother and sister. School starts at  
 8.55 a.m. and I leave my home at 8.45 
 a.m. I wave to my Mum and Dad then go 
 with my friends.                      
                                       
   For lunch I have a  school meal and 
 I sit by my friends. I come home from 
 school at 3.25 p.m. I go home alone or
 sometimes with my friends. When I get 
 home I have a snack and watch         
 television. I have a cooked tea at    
 5.30 p.m. In the evenings I go to     
 Brownies and I watch television I go  
 to bed at 9.30. p.m.
