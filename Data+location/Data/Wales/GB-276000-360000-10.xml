		<content> Housing in the area is very varied.   
 In the sparsely populated land to the 
 west are scattered houses. Some are   
 homes in permanent use, some holiday  
 homes, some working farms. They are   
 mostly stone built, some with recent  
 additions. As this area is in the     
 Snowdonia National Park, strict       
 regulations cover alterations to      
 property. There is no mains water.    
 Supplies come from wells, springs and 
 streams, and rain is collected in     
 tanks. There is one telephone box and 
 one post box. Children are taken to   
 schools in Trefriw (infant and junior)
 and in Llanrwst (senior) by taxi. Milk
 is delivered three times a week and   
 refuse is collected fortnightly. There
 is a daily postal service. The roads  
 are single track with passing places, 
 of indifferent quality. Heavy snow    
 creates many difficulties.            </content>
