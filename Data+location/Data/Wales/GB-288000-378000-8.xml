		<title>08The beach at Llanddulas</title>
		<content> Llanddulas beach is about a quarter   
 of a mile from the village.It is very 
 pebbly,and there is only sand when the
 tide is right out.There are groynes   
 here and there to control the waves.  
 Also,many huge boulders were brought  
 here by lorries,to make a strong sea  
 wall.                                 
     The River Dulas flows out here,   
 turning East as it reaches the beach. 
 Part of its course here is an S.S.S.I.
 because of rare plants and            
 butterflies.                          
  There are holiday chalets above the  
 beach,on a small cliff,but the beach  
 is more popular for picnics than      
 bathing,probably because it is so     
 rocky.                                
      There used to be a life-boat     
 station here,but it closed in 1932.The
 boat-house was converted into a       
 private house,right on the beach.     </content>
