		<title>02Life in the Past-Home Visit</title>
		<content> We were very lucky to be able to visit
 the home of the mother of one of the  
 teachers in our school.We all went    
 into her living room.Then we started  
 to ask our questions.We knew that the 
 answers she would give us would be    
 different to the ones we would give as
 Mrs.Williams is over Eighty Years Old!
                                       
{Did you have hot water?               
 No we had to boil it by the side of   
 the fire.                             
                                       
{Did you used to have milk in a bottle?
 We used to take a measuring jug to the
 door and a milkman with a horse and   
 cart used to fill it.                 
                                       
{Where did you get married?            
 I got married in Carmel Chapel.The    
 chapel then was full every Sunday.    
{It was an interesting visit!}         </content>
