		<title>05The Crynant Forest.</title>
		<content>      The Crynant Forest is one area of
 the{Forestry Commission's}large       
 management that is controlled from the
 centre at Rheola in the Vale of Neath.
 The first planting of trees at Crynant
 was undertaken in 1930, the majority  
 of trees planted being of a coniferous
 variety such as Sitka spruce, Japanese
 larch, Corsican pine and Scots pine.  
 Deciduous trees are also planted too, 
 willow, oak, birch, ash, alder and    
 beech.                                
      The area of the Crynant Forest is
 approximately 2,440 hectares in which 
 there are about 5 million trees. The  
 main use of the wood from the forest  
 is for timber in house building,      
 furniture, chipboard and pulp wood for
 paper-making.                         
      There are seven men employed by  
 the{Forestry Commission}and ten men   
 privately sub-contracted at Crynant.  </content>
