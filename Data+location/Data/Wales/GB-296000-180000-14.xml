		<title>14The Railway</title>
		<content> The railway through Llanharan and     
 Pencoed was constructed between 1848  
 and 1850. Llanharan Station was built 
 in 1899. The village had been without 
 a station for 49 years, due to        
 opposition from a local influenintial 
 lady who thought it would spoil the   
 piece of the village. When it was     
 opened, however, it enabled people to 
 get to work in{Bridgend, Cardiff}and  
 other outlying places. It also        
 provided a lot of local employment.   
 Pencoed and Llanharan stations were   
 closed in 1964 by Doctor Beeching, the
 then Minister of Transport. The       
 railway was part of the{Great Western 
{Railway}which was nationalised to     
 become British Railways. From time to 
 time there is talk of reopening       
 stations which lie on the main South  
 Wales to London line.
