 with parking facilities. Examples in  
 the D-Block are Agri-Electrics and    
 MFI.Local shops for everyday needs are
 in 2 main areas:1.The Parade,Blacon _ 
 two blocks of post-war shops with a   
 modern bank.    2.The Close,Blacon _ a
 1960s pedestrian precinct. Noel Baker,
 owner of The Close butchers won 1st   
 prize for British beef sausage in     
 1985. He described a typical working  
 day:After a bacon breakfast,he arrives
 at work at 08 00.(earlier Fri. &amp; Sat.)
 The shop is open for business whilst  
 the window is dressed by 4 butchers,it
 takes 1-2 hr. Sausages made,cooked    
 meats prepared, they phone hotels and 
 canteens,then make up their orders.   
 Lunch is from 13 00 - 14 00.Afterwards
 they serve, accept deliveries and from
 4 p.m empty the windows, clean trays  
 and cash up ready to close at 17 30.  </content>
