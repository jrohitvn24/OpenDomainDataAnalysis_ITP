		<title>05THE CONQUERING HERO INN</title>
		<content> The present building of the{Conquering
{Hero Inn}was built between 1850       
 to 1900 before the inn was built, some
 people say that there was a (ty dros  
 nos) a house built over night.        
 Providing a man could build his       
 house and have smoke coming out of the
 chimney before sunrise, he could have 
 that house as his own.                
 A man called Mr Roberts built the     
 inn, in those days if you fenced of a 
 plot of land for 12 years it was      
 yours. However the authority would not
 let him have the land and took the    
 fence down but Mr Roberts put the     
 fence back up and the authority took  
 it back down.So this went on and he   
 finally took it to a court of law. Mr 
 Roberts won the case and built the    
 inn.                                  
 That is one of the stories of how it  
 is called the Conquering Hero Inn.    </content>
