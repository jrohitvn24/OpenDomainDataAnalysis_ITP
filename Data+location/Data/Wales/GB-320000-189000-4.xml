  On the crest of Mynydd Machen, near  
 the path crossing from Danygraig to   
 Machen, is an outcrop of rock known as
 "Where the Devil broke his apron      
 strings". It consists of a pile of    
 stones, resembling a collapsed wall,  
 on the face of a small rise.          
  One version of the local story to    
 account for its presence is that the  
 Devil, for reasons known only to      
 himself, decided to obliterate        
 Cardiff. To do so, he picked up a load
 of stones from a similar outcrop near 
 Pontypool and put the stones in his   
 apron. He then flew directly to       
 Cardiff but as he passed over Mynydd  
 Machen his apron strings broke and the
 stones fell to their present position.
