		<title>06Education in Bwlchysarnau</title>
		<content> The only school in Bwlchysarnau is a  
 county primary school built in 1870   
 which caters for pupils from the ages 
 of 4 to 11. At present there is a Head
 teacher, assistant teacher and 15     
 pupils of mixed ages and ability. This
 school has been under threat of       
 closure for the past 6 years, due to  
 its small roll but it is considered a 
 special case as it is situated in the 
 middle of a large rural area, with the
 nearest alternative schools at least  
 10 miles away. Along with the church  
 it performs an important function as a
 focus for the scattered community and 
 the teachers try to involve the pupils
 with the envoironment and the         
 residents.                            
   At the age of 11 pupils transfer to 
 Llanidloes HighSchool, 10 miles away  
 involving a \ hour bus trip.This small
 comprehensive school has 500 pupils.  </content>
