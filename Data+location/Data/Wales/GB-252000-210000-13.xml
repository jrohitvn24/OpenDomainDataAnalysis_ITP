		<content> There are three public parks in       
 Tumble, two in Lower Tumble and one in
 Upper Tumble.                         
   The largest of the three is Parc y  
 Mynydd Mawr (Great Mountain) which is 
 in the centre of the village. It was  
 started by the Welfare Association of 
 the village during the 20's after the 
 bulding of the Public Hall. Its chief 
 purpose being to provide for the      
 leisure and recreation of the local   
 miners.                               
   In the park there is a children's   
 corner with swings, a see-saw, slide  
 and a climbing frame shaped like an   
 aeroplane and also seats and benches  
 for people to sit on. It has one      
 pavilion, two separate changing rooms,
 two Rugby pitches, one Soccer pitch, a
 bowling green and two tennis courts.  
 It is looked after by a full time park
 keeper/groundsman.                    </content>
