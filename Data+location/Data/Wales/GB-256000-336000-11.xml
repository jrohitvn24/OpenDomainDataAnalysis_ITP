		<title>11PORTHMADOG POLICE</title>
		<content> In Porthmadog there is a police       
 station with twelve police officers   
 based there.Itis not manned           
 continuously,but there is cover over  
 the full 24 hours.If it is closed,the 
 public have to contact Pwllheli,14    
 miles away,through the usual 999 call.
 The town is policed by patrol on foot 
 but the out-lying areas are covered by
 police cars.Borth-y-Gest is covered by
 patrol car from Porthmadog,but        
 Minffordd is in the charge of the     
 police at Penrhyndeudraeth.The area is
 generally law-abiding with little or  
 no major crime.House-burglaries and   
 thefts from unattended cars are the   
 most common crimes.There is a marked  
 increase in petty crime during the    
 summer months when there is an influx 
 of visitors to the area.
