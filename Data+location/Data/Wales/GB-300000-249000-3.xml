		<title>03BUILTH (WEST)HOME LIFE.</title>
		<content>  Many people have lived in Builth all 
 their lives,although,there are many   
 people who have moved from larger     
 towns and cities.A lot of elderly     
 people live here,they moved to Builth 
 when they retired.The community is    
 growing rapidly,although Builth could 
 do with a lot more shops,as shopping  
 in Builth is expensive,and not very   
 good for bulk shopping and variety,   
 when bulk shopping is needed,most     
 people go to larger towns.            
  But,the problem with going to larger 
 towns,is the lack of public           
 transport.Most elderly people rely on 
 public transport for visiting,and     
 shopping are the only way to get      
 around.                               
  The facilities for younger people are
 poor.At the moment we are in need of a
 new school.                           
                                       </content>
