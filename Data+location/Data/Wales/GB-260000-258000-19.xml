   Charles and Carolyn Wacher have     
 22 acres of land leading down to the  
 Aeron. On 10 acres of this land are   
 grown organic vegetables. This means  
 that unlike some farms in the area,   
 they use no ARTIFICIAL chemicals or   
 fertilisers. Instead they use a lot of
 horse/cow manure and they make compost
 from vegetable waste, straw, weeds,   
 and when the compost is ready they    
 spread it onto the ground or dig it in
 to maintain the fertility. As the     
 climate is severe they need polythene 
 greenhouses, 7 in all in which to get 
 early crops of tomatoes, cucumbers,   
 and courgettes. They sell the         
 vegetables almost entirely to local   
 shops in the Lampeter and Tregaron    
 area. At the weekly markets the people
 of Llangeitho buy the Wachers' organic
 vegetables because they taste better. </content>
