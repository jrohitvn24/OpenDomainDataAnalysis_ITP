		<title>02FARMING AROUND LLANDYSUL</title>
		<content> The average farm is about 100 acres.  
 Most of the land is pasture for dairy 
 cattle. The main crops are silage, hay
 and corn used for winter feed for the 
 animals. Some farmers keep small      
 numbers of sheep and beef cattle.     
 Tankers collect the milk for the Milk 
 Marketing Board. Farmers receive 60p a
 gallon. The recent E.E.C. milk Quota  
 has affected the dairy farmers because
 now they can only produce a certain   
 number of gallons for which they will 
 be paid. Many farmers are having to   
 reduce their herds or move into       
 different kinds of farming. The main  
 dairy breed is the Freisian cow. Every
 cow produces an average of five to six
 gallons daily. A veterinary group     
 practice in the village serves the    
 farming area and beyond, and a large  
 livestock market is held in the       
 village every other Tuesday.          </content>
