		<content>  Our block is in a very rural area of 
 West Wales.There is very little       
 industry,and the majority of the      
 inhabitants are conected with         
 agriculture.                          
 The block contains the village of     
 Bancyfelin and the hamlet of          
 Llangynog.                            
 The A40 trunk road runs east to west  
 through the block,while the river     
 Cywin runs north,south.               
 Most of the land is used for dairy or 
 mixed farming,the majority of the     
 farms being small and family run.     
 Eventhough the main London,Fishguard  
 railway running east,west cuts the    
 block in half there is no station and 
 it is a very quiet,peaceful area.     
 Many of the farms and houses are      
 isolated and the great majority of    
 families have their own transport,many
 families having two or three vehicles.</content>
