		<title>09 Vauxhall Army Camp</title>
		<content>  Vauxhall camp has been used as a     
training camp for cadets,regular and   
territorial soldiers.Nearby are the    
Brecon Beacons which has proved a      
testing training area for the highly   
professional British Army.             
  This year,Monmouth received some very
bad news.The Ministry of Defence       
directed that the camp should close.   
This caused concern amongst local      
councillors as the visitors to the camp
brought considerable revenue to the    
town.                                  
  For centuries,Monmouth has been the  
home of the Royal Monmouthshire Royal  
Engineers.The Sargeants' Mess of the   
R.M.R.E. is situated on Vauxhall Camp  
and regular functions are held for the 
enjoyment of past and present members  
of the regiment.
