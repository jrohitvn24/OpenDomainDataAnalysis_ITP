		<content> There are two churches on our Domesday
 patch,Stepaside Chapel in Mochdre and 
 the Pentecostal church, down in the   
                                       
 valley.Fifty years ago there were many
 more members at the chapel;today about
 twenty attend.The denomination is     
 Wesleyan.                             
    Built in 1976 the Pentecostal      
 church can hold 400 people and some   
 200 attend regularily.The collection  
 is often  more than Â£500.Three        
 mini-buses are used for trips and     
 there are ten classes in the Sunday   
 school.As well as the organ,the church
 has a synthesiser,violins,guitars and 
 drums.The church is used during the   
 week by a number of groups;the        
 playschool is very popular,with thirty
 attending.
