		<title>15THE NURSE'S DAY</title>
		<content> My mother is a staff nurse at Cimla   
 hospital.She works on Rheola ward.She 
 works a day shift from 07:00h to      
 15:00h and an afternoon shift from    
 12:30h to 20:30h.She looks after chest
 patients.Their ages vary from 17 years
 to over 80 years.She wears a uniform. 
 It is a blue dress,white hat,black    
 shoes and a dark blue cape.She also   
 has a small fob watch. She is able to 
 measure the patients' pulse rates     
 using her watch.She dispenses drugs   
 and medicines and administers many    
 injections.There is a break from      
 13:00h to 13:30h but my mother does   
 her clerical work in that time.There  
 are 30 beds for patients in her ward. 
 12 are for males, 12 for females and 6
 are cubicles for patients who require 
 regular injections and extra          
 attention.My mother enjoys nursing but
 it is hard work. Andrew,11 years.     </content>
