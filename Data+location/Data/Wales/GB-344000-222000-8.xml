		<title>08Living by Garway Hill</title>
		<content> My house is opposite a lane that leads
 to a footpath to the top of Garway    
 Hill. From the top of the hill you can
 see for miles. On a clear day you can 
 see the Bristol Channel, Gloucester,  
 Ross, Hereford, Monmouth, the         
 Malverns, and many hills in Wales.    
       At the very top there is a pill 
 box, which was put there in the Second
 World War as an anti-aircraft gun     
 emplacement. Next to it there is a    
 white stone with some numbers on it.  
 This is a triangulation point. The top
 of the hill is 1200ft. above sea      
 level. Near the top there is a pond   
 that the horses drink from. Sometimes 
 people fly model aeroplanes or kites  
 on the hill. There is also a          
 scrambling track. I ride my BMX bike  
 on it. I like going over jumps, and   
 going down into dips and up the other 
 side.                                 </content>
