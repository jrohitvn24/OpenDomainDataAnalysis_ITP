 There are many chapels in our         
 area.There are five in our village    
 alone,but three of those are empty.   
 There are 2 Sunday scools,one in the  
 chapel and the other in church.       
                During the 1900's the  
 chapels were full because of the      
 religious revival,but now they stand  
 empty.There is one Catholic church for
 the whole area and most of the english
 people go there.Chapel is open three  
 times on Sunday.It is open 10.00a.m   
 for the morning service,at 2.00p.m for
 Sunday school and at 6.00p.m for      
 evening service.When we asked the     
 children in our school if they enjoyed
 going to chapel most of them said it  
 was boring.                           </content>
