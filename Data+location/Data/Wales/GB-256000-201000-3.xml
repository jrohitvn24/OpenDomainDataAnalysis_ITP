		<content> The main railway track passing through
 the area is part of the Heart of Wales
 railway line from Llanelli to         
 Shrewsbury. This line mainly carries  
 passengers on five trains per day     
 travelling in each direction. In the  
 summer months this line is a popular  
 tourist attraction.                   
 There is also a railway line which is 
 used to by pass Swansea and is used by
 through-freight trains from West Wales
 to Cardiff and further east. The      
 bridge carrying this track over the   
{River Loughor}is a very distinct one  
 and contains eleven arches and is one 
 of the local landmarks.               
 The only station in the block, is a   
 halt, and is at{Llangennech.          
 Local people believe that both lines  
 will be closed in the near future.
