		<title>14PORTHMADOG GIRL GUIDES</title>
		<content> Porthmadog has been associated with   
 the{Girl Guide}movement for over sixty
 years.At present we have approximately
 eighty girls shared between a{Ranger  
 unit,two{Guide}units and two{Brownie  
 units.During their weekly meetings all
 the girls work around the eight-point 
 programme which gives them a general  
 interest in and outlook on life.They  
 are encouraged to enjoy the outdoors, 
 keep fit,expore the arts,home skills, 
 to give service in the comunity,to    
 make friends,to think for themselves  
 and to keep the Guide Law.During 1985 
 they have been celebrating 75 years of
 Guiding and a special flower-bed was  
 planted in the local park with a      
 pictorial motif connected with the    
 Guides.In 1985 too they moved to their
 new headquarters in Garth Road,       
 formerly the Church Rooms.
