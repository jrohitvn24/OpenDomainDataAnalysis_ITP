		<title>05UNEPLOYMENT IN THE VALLEYS</title>
		<content> There is of course unfortunately a    
 very high level of unemployment in    
 the area within our block.There are   
 many long term unemployed often with  
 little or no future prospect of       
 employment                            
{                                      
{As many as one in four are unemployed 
{in the Cynon valley at the present    
{time.}                                
                                       
 There will of course be a further rise
 in unemployment when the colliery at  
 Penrhiwceiber closes at the end of the
 year.Men working there at the moment  
 will have the choice of transferring  
 to{Taff Vale Colliery.}However it does
 mean little or no jobs for future     
 school leavers.It will probably affect
 firms and small industries which are  
 dependant on the colliery, making     
 things even worse.                    </content>
