		<title>02Sealand,why that name.</title>
		<content> As the name suggests the land around  
 our area was many years ago covered   
 by the sea,so sea-land this being the 
 case we find today that the soil in   
 this area is very very sandy.Part of  
 our area is in England and part in    
 Wales.Most of the land today is       
 grassland and it is used for farming. 
 Only a few farms have crops.With the  
 near closure of the Shotton Steel     
 Works some 7 years ago when some 9,000
 people were made redundant,many small 
 industries have come into the area,an 
 industrial estate has been built here,
 here at Sealand.Some of the buildings 
 are quite large,but only employ a few 
 people.So today we find that many are 
 unemployed.The land being dug up to   
 form this new industrial area is a    
 sandy colour and is very good for     
 drainage.
