		<title>13TREDEGAR-industrial history</title>
		<content>   Tredegar is in a state of decline,  
decay and possibly disintegration as a 
once flourishing valley town.  What is 
left reflects the prosperity of the    
past and what have might been.  The    
reason for the decline are many, but   
basiclly they fit into the geographical
position of the town,- at the heads of 
the valleys-the economic move of the   
industry-the economic move of indust to
oast and the world wide decline in     
trade today.                           
The town built its prosrity in the     
induaal revolution. Before this George 
Borrow on his travels described the    
Howy valley as one of the most         
beautiful in the area. Then iron and   
coal were found and first the Sirhowy  
Ironworks belched its fumes of sulphur 
ad smoke to scar the top end of        
the valley and then the Tredegar       
Ironworks opened in the town itself.   </content>
