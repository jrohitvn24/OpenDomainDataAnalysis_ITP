		<title>17Pets' Survey in Tremorfa.</title>
		<content> 33% of people interviewed did not own 
 a pet.Of the remaining two thirds who 
 did own pets about 70% had one or more
 dogs.The next most popular pet was the
 cat.About 23% of pet owners had       
 cats.Only two people had both cats and
 dogs.Other popular pets               
 included;fish,budgerigars,and other   
 birds such as racing pigeons.         
 About 50% of these pet owners spent Â£3
 to Â£4 per week on pet food;about 30%  
 spent 50p to Â£3 per week on pet food  
 while the rest spent as much as Â£5 per
 week on pet food.This is surprising   
 and worth comparing since the average 
 weekly wage is Â£100 per week.
