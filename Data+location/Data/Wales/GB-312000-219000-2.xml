		<title>02TOURISM IN LLANGYNIDR</title>
		<content> THE MAIN ATTRACTION OF LLANGYNIDR IS  
 THE CANAL. THIS RUNS FROM BRECON TO   
 MONMOUTH AND NEWPORT AND HAS THE      
 LONGEST WORKING CANAL TUNNEL IN       
 BRITAIN. TOURISTS COME TO THE VILLAGE 
 ON BARGES AND STOP TO SEE THE PRETTY  
 COUNTRYSIDE. THE RIVER USK RUNS       
 THROUGH THE VILLAGE. IT IS CROSSED BY 
 A VERY ATTRACTIVE NARROW BRIDGE WHICH 
 HAS SIX ARCHES AND AN UNUSUAL SHAPE.  
 TOURISM HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON   
 THE VILLAGE SHOP. WITHOUT IT A SMALL  
 BUSINESS WOULD BE STRUGGLING TO       
 SURVIVE. TOURISTS STAY FOR BED AND    
 BREAKFAST AT LLANDETTY HALL FARM,     
 WHICH IS 380 YEARS OLD.THE PRESENT    
 TENNANTS HAVE BEEN LIVING AT THE FARM 
 FOR 20 YEARS AND THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING
 BED AND BREAKFAST FOR 13 YEARS. THE   
 VISITORS COME FROM ALL OVER BRITAIN,  
 EUROPE AND AS FAR AS AMERICA.THE BLACK
 MOUNTAINS SURROUND LLANGYNIDR.        </content>
