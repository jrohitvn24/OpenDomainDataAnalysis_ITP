		<content>   Years ago people used to live in    
 pink cottages.They mixed pig's blood  
 with whitewash after a pig killing.   
 There is only one pink cottage left in
 Templeton.                            
  Captain Martin who sailed to the West
 Indies with Captain Cook lived at     
 Martin's Farm.                        
  The Grove Farm was the birthplace of 
 Colonel John Poyer who held Pembroke  
 Castle against Cromwell who later     
 sentenced him to death.               
  Ty Henlloy Cottage used to be the    
 Manse for Molleston Chapel.It is the  
 birthplace of Lord Gordon Parry of    
 Neyland, who was the Chairman of the  
 Wales Tourist Board.His father was the
 Baptist Minister of Molleston Chapel. 
  Templeton Station still exists but it
 was closed down in June 1964.
