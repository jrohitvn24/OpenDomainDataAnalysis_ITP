		<content> Two doctors from St Clears (9 miles   
 away) hold surgeries in Llansteffan   
 and Llanybri once weekly, but for some
 treatment patients have to go to St   
 Clears. Some people go to the         
 Carmarthen doctors. All the doctors   
 make local home visits when necessary.
 District nurses, midwives and health  
 visitors visit patients regularly; a  
 baby clinic is held weekly. The       
 nearest dentists, opticians,          
 chiropodists and pharmacists are in   
 Carmarthen. Neighbours help in        
 fetching prescribed medicines, etc.   
 Our hospital is at Carmarthen; for    
 some specialised treatment people must
 go to Morriston or Singleton at       
 Swansea. Meals on wheels are provided 
 for a few disabled elderly people,    
 distributed by volunteers, organised  
 by Dyfed County Council, as is the    
 Home Help service for the Disabled.   </content>
