		<title>12Law and Order in Rhos 2</title>
		<content> There most frequent call out is for   
 vandalism,particularly in the areas   
 were offenders cannot be seen by the  
 public. To prevent this a crimewatch  
 campain has been set up by the local  
 newspaper,'The Evening Leader'. Also  
 there is a community police officer   
 who keeps watch for vandals and other 
 trouble makers suchas burglars.His    
 name is Mr.Ken Davies.The community   
 policeman tries to get to know the    
 people better, especeally the children
 so that they will not be frightened to
 report any disturbance.They will know 
 who to go to immediately.             
 Although Rhos is a quiet village there
 is a fair amount of crime(particularly
 theft,vandalism and house squabbles!) 
 but the police cope with it very well 
 and are highly respected by most      
 people in the community.
