 Dr Seth Jones qualified as a doctor 31

 Neath, moved to London and was        
 evacuated to the village of Llandybie 
 during the war, a village about 8     
 miles away.he has been our village    
 doctor for 26 years.                  
 in 1959 there was only one road which 
 was surfaced with tarmac, all the     
 others were unmade. He remembers a    
 chip shop, a sweet shop and the       
 Cooperative Stores which is now the VG
 shop. There was also a bakery which   
 was called the Curwen Stores.They also
 sold meat and vegetables there. It is 
 now a public house called the Baker's 
 Arms.There was also another old public
 house called the Maerdy. It was built 
 in 1920. This was a beautiful building
 with old beams and to get to it you   
 had to cross a pack bridge.....       </content>
