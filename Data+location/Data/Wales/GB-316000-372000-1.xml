		<title>01LANDSCAPE AROUND BRYNFORD.</title>
		<content>   In our village there are lots of    
 houses and farms. We have a park next 
 to our football pitch. In our park we 
 have four swings,a rounabout and a    
 slide. We have an old school in our   
 village it is not used for a school   
 now,it is used for a playgroup and a  
 youth club and jumble sales are held  
 in the village hall.                  
   We have two shops; one is a post    
 office which sells groceries. We also 
 have two pubs called the Llyn y Mawn  
 and the Crooked Horn.  We also have a 
 hospital nearby called Lluesty        
 hospital which is an old peole's home 
 and convalescent hospital.            
   Most of the land around Brynford is 
 common land where sheep graze.There   
 are a lot of old quarries and old lead
 mine shafts around the village.
