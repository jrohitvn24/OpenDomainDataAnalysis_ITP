		<title>03FARMING IN TRELAWNYD</title>
		<content> Farming plays a large role in the life
 of this area. The villagers are       
 surrounded by farms, some of which,   
 have been handeds down from one       
 generation to another. The Gop farm, a
 farm seeped in History, is the        
 largest. This specialises in dairy    
 cattle whilst adjacent farms          
 specialise in sheep.                  
 Thew village milkman have their own   
 herds of cattle, consequently milk    
 deliveries take place at a later time 
 than usual.  There is a wide range of 
 cereals grown and most of the farmers 
 devote some of their land to potato   
 production.                           
 Livestock is taken to the markets at  
 St.Asaph, Abergele, and Mold.
