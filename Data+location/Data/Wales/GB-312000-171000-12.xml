		<content>  In 1536-39 John Leland described the 
 castle as "Being all in ruine saving  
 one high tower". The farm today is    
 owned by the Rees family.             
 Other prominent features include the  
 Beauville and the Ysguborgoch farms,  
 which were also part of the Medieval  
 Wrinstone estate.   Today the         
 Beauville farm is primarily concerned 
 with mixed stock and hay production.  
 During the 19th century, the tithe or 
 red barn served as a slaughterhouse   
 for the whole of the Wenvoe area.     
 Part of the Beauville farmhouse is    
 actually of Tudor origin, when it was 
 used as a fortified manor-house.   The
 origin of the name Beauville is a     
 mystery but between 1500 and the      
 present day it was spelt "Bove Hill"  
 meaning "farm under the hill".
