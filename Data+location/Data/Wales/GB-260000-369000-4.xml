		<title>04Penrhyn Castle</title>
		<content>      There are over 200 rooms in the  
 castle but the public can visit only  
 13.                                   
      The castle is open from April    
 when the season starts to September   
 when the season ends. The castle is   
 open from 12 midday to 5pm,everyday   
 except Tuesdays. It costs Â£1.00 to get
 in for adults and 60p for children.   
      The land was split up into parts 
 owned by Penrhyn Castle,Penrhyn       
 Estates and The National Trust.       
      There are many trains in the     
 Railway Museum,most are quarry        
 trains,some from the Penrhyn quarries.
      The Pennant family had their own 
 carriage elaborately furnished so that
 when the family wanted to go down to  
 the quarries they could travel in     
 comfort. It was not like that for the 
 workmen who had small cramped trucks.
