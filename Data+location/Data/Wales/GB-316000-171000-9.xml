		<title>09PENARTH LIFEBOAT STATION.</title>
		<content> The first lifeboat station was opened 
 in 1861. The present station has a "D"
 class inflatable lifeboat, with a 40  
 hp. outboard engine, and has a max.   
 speed of 21 knots. It would cost about
 Â£8,000 to replace. There are 21 men in
 the crew, but only 3 people are needed
 to man the boat, and two to help      
 launch it. The crew is led by Capt. W.
 Sommerfield. Since the present station
 opened in 1980, the lifeboat has been 
 launched 113 times, and 39 people have
 been rescued. The most common cause   
 for a callout is to rescue people     
 stranded on Sully Island. Visitors are
 not aware of the wide tide range,     
 which is the second largest in the    
 world. The crew are all volunteers,   
 and are responsible for the area of   
 coast from Newport to Barry.
