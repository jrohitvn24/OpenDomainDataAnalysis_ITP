		<title>01REVIEW OF SWANSEA WEST</title>
		<content>{Swansea West comprises many villages  
{which the expanding town has "invaded"
{to form part of the suburbs, e.g.     
{Sketty.These places retain some of    
{their original atmosphere.There are 3 
{main types of housing:inter-war       
{private,post-war private and post-war 
{council houses.Transport facilities   
{are good,with the main A4118 running  
{through the area,linking Swansea with 
{Gower.Farming is mainly rough grazing.
{There are areas of open grass and wood
{land amongst the various housing      
{estates.During the working day, the   
{area is very quiet,as most people who 
{live in our area work outside it.It is
{also fairly quiet in the evenings     
{because in general, young people go   
{into the city centre for              
{entertainment.This is not a tourist   
{area but the Gower beaches are nearby.
