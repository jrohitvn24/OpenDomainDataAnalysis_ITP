		<title>10Farming Problems in Dyfed</title>
		<content> Farmers always grumble that we        
 know,but perhaps their present        
 grievances are justified.  Dairy      
 farmers here naturally find that the  
 EEC milk quota system imposed on them,
 has hampered plans for expansion,     
 eroded their independence and enerally
 has far-reaching repercussions on     
 prices - some profits down by half.   
 Others who have decided to rear their 
 bull calves instead of selling at a   
 few weeks olds, will have to wait 18  
 months for any proit from them.       
 Alternatively the beef and sheep men  
 are forecasting a glut of their       
 products as more dairy farmers branch 
 out into their field.  They also feel 
 aggrievated that they, on the other   
 hand, cannot decide to keep a small   
 dairy herd as they have no quota.     
 Their profits are already down.
