		<content>  British Rail run a single track      
 railway from Llandudno to Blaenau     
 Ffestiniog north to south through the 
 Conwy valley. There is a station at   
 Llanrwst, and it is here that we find 
 the loop in the line which allows up  
 and down trains to pass.  Llanrwst is 
 an unmanned station and fares are paid
 to the guard on the train. The trains 
 must halt at a signal box about 3OOyds
 north of the station for the exchange 
 of tokens, which are leather bound    
 rings with small purses attached. The 
 driver may not proceed without this   
 exchange which prevents two trains    
 using the same length of track at the 
 same time.                            
 The service is very limited in winter,
 6 trains in each direction daily and  
 no Sunday service. In summer the      
 service is augmented to 9 trains and  
 special Sunday excursions are run.    </content>
