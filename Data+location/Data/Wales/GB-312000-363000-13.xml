    The ground rises steeply on either 
 side of the path which is densly      
 covered with bracken, substantial     
 areas of ground being cleared (cut    
 back by hand) to provide grazing for  
 the sheep.                            
   DERELICT LAND.                      
    On the slope to the left of the    
 path are the remains of a former stone
 quarry, long disused, now over grown  
 and providing good shelter for the    
 sheep.
