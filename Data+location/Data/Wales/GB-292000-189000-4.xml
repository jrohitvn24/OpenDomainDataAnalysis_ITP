		<content>  Our school is at the bottom of Adare 
 Street it is called Fronwen Primary   
 School. There are three yards and two 
 shelters underneath the classrooms.   
 There are two entrances where one gate
 leads to the infants yard and the     
 other leads to the juniors yard. There
 are seven on the staff including the  
 headmaster and three of them are male 
 and the others are female. There are  
 149 children in the school and 77 are 
 boys and 72 are girls. The age range  
 is from 4 to 11. There are ten        
 classrooms but two of them are not    
 used. We have a hall which is used as 
 a dining room. The school dinners are 
 cooked in another school and brought  
 to the school in containers. We have a
 special class called the "Oppurtunity 
 class" and on some days a teacher     
 comes to give some children extra help
 with their reading.                   </content>
