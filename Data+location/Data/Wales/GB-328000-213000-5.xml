		<title>05Games We Play</title>
		<content>As a result of a questionnaire,it was  
established that the variety of games  
differed with the age and sex of the   
child.A seven year old girl played     
games like skipping,leap frog,hop      
scotch in the garden or playground.    
The boys of the same age played Tap    
it,Chase and Conkers.Many of the games 
mimicked heroes seen on television e.g.
Star Trek,A Team,Robin Hood,Star Wars  
and Knight Rider.Both boys and girls   
played team games like "Please Jack may
we cross the water","In and out of the 
Scottish bluebells","The Farmer's in   
the den".These involved singing rhymes 
played while dancing or skipping in    
a ring.The games played at home were of
a commercial nature,snakes and         
ladders,ludo,Connect 4 and Monopoly    
were the most popular with the seven   
year old boys and girls.
