		<content> In Tumble there are eight             
 nonconformist chapels or churches and 
 one church. These in the main are     
 attended on Sunday and on other       
 weekday evenings by members of the    
 older generation and by children. Most
 services are conducted in the Welsh   
 Language. There is a strong           
 nonconformist tradition in the        
 village. Four of the smaller          
 denominations broke away from the     
 other nonconformist denominations     
 after the revival of 1904.            
   The Church of Wales, (Eglwys Dewi   
 Sant) St. David's Church has 250      
 members but only 40 approximately     
 attend services there on a Sunday.    
 Sunday School is attended by about 12 
 to 15 children. There is also a       
 Mothers' Union who meet during a      
 weekday evening. The Vicar is the Rev.
 John Gravell.                         </content>
