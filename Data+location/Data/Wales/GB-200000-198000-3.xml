		<content> William Gooch is a young man who lives
 with his parents on a farm near       
 Hodgeston.He attends school in        
 Pembroke and is studying for his A    
 levels.He does not like living in the 
 area as he feels there is little      
 stimulation for a boy of his age in   
 the rural environment.Although he     
 agrees that there are some basic      
 facilities such as a playng field and 
 open spaces,a social club and more    
 elaborate sports facilities are really
 required in the village.For any social
 activities he has to travel to        
 Pembroke either by bus or train,both  
 of which operate limited services.His 
 aspirations are to obtain a secure job
 with a decent salary,to marry and to  
 have children.He realises that decent 
 employment will require a move to a   
 more built up area                    
                                       </content>
