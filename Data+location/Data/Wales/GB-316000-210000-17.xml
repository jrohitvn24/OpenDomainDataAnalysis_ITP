		<content>{WHITSUN WALK   }                      
 The Noncornformist Chapels' annual    
 'walk' first took place in July 1853. 
 Each Whitsun since then the children  
 of the Sunday schools have joined with
 the adults to march in procession     
 through the main streets of the area  
 to demonstrate their strength and     
 faith.In fair weather it is customary 
 for a large silken banner to be       
 carried ahead of the congregation.Each
 banner is inscribed with the name of  
 the Sunday School and underneath is a 
 religious picture and a text.The      
 minister and elders walk behind the   
 banner followed by the choir singing  
 well practised special hymns;then the 
 children walk two by two with their   
 teachers.Afterwards there is a        
 teaparty and perhaps games. Sadly the 
 custom has become less popular.
