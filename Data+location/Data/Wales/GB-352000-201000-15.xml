		<title>15FARMING -ST.BRIAVELS COMMON</title>
		<content>     St.Briavels Common today has four 
 farms of over 100 acres,three are     
 Dairy and one is Sheep and Beef.There 
 are many smallholdings and cottages.  
     The Hudnalls Farm is owned by Mr. 
 and Mrs.John Bennett.They have one    
 hundred acres of land,six acres is    
 permanent grass,two acres is woodland 
 and the rest is used for grass,sillage
 or growing turnips.They keep about    
 fifty-five Friesian milking cows and a
 few sheep and beef cattle.The refrige-
 rated milk tanker collects their milk 
 and takes it to the creamery in Stone-
 house.                                
      Thirty years ago they employed   
 four men but now Mr.and Mrs.Bennett   
 and their son work the farm themsel-  
 ves.They have added twenty acres to   
 their land in that time, but do not   
 expect to expand any further.
