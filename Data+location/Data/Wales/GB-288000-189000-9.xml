		<content>  Forestry is important chiefly on the 
 north-facing slope of the valley.     
  Planting began in 1940 and continued 
 until the late 60's. Four species of  
 tree are grown:- Scots pine, Japanese 
 larch,Sitka spruce and Longpole pine. 
 Each type of tree is suited to a      
 particular type of soil on the valley 
 slopes including colliery waste.      
  The trees are felled when they are   
 40-50 years old , and the ground is   
 then replanted.                       
  Two problems face the forestry:-     
 sheep which cause damage to young     
 trees and fires,                      
 though this risk has been reduced.    
  Apart from economic gain, the        
 covering of bare hillside and coaltips
 has restored some of the natural      
 beauty of this region.
