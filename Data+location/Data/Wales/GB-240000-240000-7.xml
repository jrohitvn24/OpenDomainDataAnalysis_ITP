		<content>{COLLECTING NEW YEARS GIFTS.           
 This is a custom confined to Welsh    
 rural areas, particularly Dyfed, and  
 has been performed in Llandysul for   
 centuaries. Children go around houses 
 on the morning of{New Years Day }     
 wishing the people good luck for the  
 new year. They knock at the door, and 
 sing or recite a short verse about    
 health and good wishes for the family,
 and wish everyone inside a{Happy New  
{Year.}In return they receive small    
 gifts of money or food, The custom has
 rapidly declined over the years and   
 this year,1985, very few children came
 collecting because the children today 
 get enough pocket money and food.     
 Also, many children may not have been 
 told about the custom by their        
 parents.
