		<content> Teifi Valley Bilingual School.        
 The school was set up in September    
 1984 as part of the reorganisation of 
 Secondary Education in the Teifi      
 valley. Its aim is to provide a       
 Comprehensive Secondary education     
 through the medium of Welsh (apart    
 from Science subjects and maths which 
 are taught in English) and in so doing
 foster and preserve the Welsh language
 which is a feature of the area. The   
 buildings are those of the previous   
 Grammar School. Pupils travel from a  
 wide area by bus. Non-Welsh speaking  
 pupils and Welsh learners are         
 encouraged to attend, with additional 
 lessons being set up to improve their 
 Welsh. 170 pupils attend at present,  
 the aim being to attract 500. The     
 alternative school is at Newcastle    
 Emlyn Comprehensive School further    
 down the valley.                      </content>
