		<title>09LLANDYSUL FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> The station was built in 1964 and is  
 maintained by 13 part-time fire-men.  
 It has one fire engine which carries  
 400 gallons of water. The men practice
 each Thursday evening during which    
 they get a series of drills and       
 lectures about fire fighting. They are
 called to man the fire engine by a    
 bleeper system. The main types of     
 fires they are called to are at hay   
 barns, farm buildings, or domestic    
 chimney fires. They recieve{Â£6}per    
 fire they attend and{Â£5}per Practice. 
 The minimum number of men required on 
 the engine before it can go out on    
 call is 6. A fire-man has to retire at
 55. The station covers an area of 7   
 miles radius and has won several      
 inter-station competitions. Its       
 closure would mean relying on the     
 Carmarthen Brigade which is 15 miles  
 away.                                 </content>
