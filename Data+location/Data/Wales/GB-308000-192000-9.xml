    Extra curricular activities play a 
 big part in the life of Coedylan      
 Comprehensive School.Much is done for 
 charity.During 1985 Â£200 was collected
 for the Ethiopia Famine Fund.In 1984  
 the lower school pupils held a harvest
 festival for the old age              
 pensioners,bringing in a variety of   
 food which was then distributed to the
 elderly of the district.Over a period 
 of 3 years lower school children also 
 raised Â£950 to help pay for the       
 training of guide dogs for the blind. 
 A dance was held for a young girl to  
 receive treatment for leukaemia.Boys  
 regularly maintain the memorial and   
 graves of unnamed miners who lost     
 their lives in the disaster at the    
 Albion Colliery whose reclaimed site  
 the school was built on.
