		<title>15The Rose Queen</title>
		<content>   The Rose Queen was started in 1941  
 by Mrs E Sheppard and Mrs E Maddock.  
 They wanted to start it because it    
 would give Saughall some pleasure.    
 The very first Rose Queen was Anne    
 Huges who now lives in New Zealand    
 with some of her family.They used to  
 wear plain white bride's dresses, a   
 bit like today. It had a very small   
 connection with the Saughall Parish   
 Church. People used to come and watch 
 the Rose Queen. It was first held at  
 Shotwick House when Mr. Tickle was    
 warden.They still have Rose Queens    
 today and this year in 1985 it was    
 Rachel Jones from Thomas Wedge Junior 
 School. It all started  from the May  
 Fairs many years ago. The Rose        
 Queen has now been going for 15 years.
 "Although very nervous I enjoyed my   
 day when I was crowned at the         
 vicarage Garden Fete." Rachel Jones.  </content>
