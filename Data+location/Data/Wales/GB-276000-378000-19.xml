		<content>{Llandudno}is one of the rare towns to 
 have the combination of countryside   
 and seaside within a couple of miles  
 of each other.Our survey showed that  
 the highest percentage choice for     
 coming to Llandudno was the           
 seashore.This was 24%,followed closely
 by the countryside 22%.15% thought the
 area nice for walking.Coach           
 tours,castles and the night-life only 
 covered for 3% of the survey          
 respectively.Shopping covered 8%,this 
 could be becuse many people from the  
 surrounding valleys come to the town  
 for its chain stores.There are no     
 large chain stores down the Conwy     
 Valley.Theatres and night-life showed 
 only 7%,Llandudno caters mainly for   
 the elderly tourist and thus the      
 night-life is very limited.There are  
 only two theatres in the town.
