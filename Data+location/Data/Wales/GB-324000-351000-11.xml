		<title>11Gwynfryn - My Village</title>
		<content>  The village I live in is called      
 Gwynfryn.It is a small village.The    
 nearest town is Wrexham which is six  
 miles away.The nearest villages are   
 Bwlchgwyn and Minera.My family goes   
 shopping mostly in Wrexham because    
 Gwynfryn has no shops.It is important 
 to own a car in Gwynfryn because the  
 bus service is not very frequent.     
  The nice things about this village   
 are the nice view,the wild life,fresh 
 air and the youth club,which is open  
 once a week.The bad things about it   
 are-no shops,the weather is cold and  
 wet in winter and the school is far   
 from the village.The population of    
 Gwynfryn is about five hundred        
 people.Most of the houses in Gwynfryn 
 are made of stone but there are some  
 modern houses built of brick on the   
 outskirts of the village.
