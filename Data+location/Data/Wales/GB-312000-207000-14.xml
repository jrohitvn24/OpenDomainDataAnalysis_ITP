		<content>In 1818 the Sirhowy Ironworks passed to
Mr. Harford and the Ebbw Vale          
works:this the town into two groups in 
that Sirhowy and Dukestown belonged to 
EVale whilst the rest of the town owed 
its allegiaance to the Tredegar Iron   
Company.                               
In 1910 the Tredegar Ironworks was     
closed and was moved to Newport.This   
was due to the fact that the works had 
never converted to the Bessemer or Open
hearth processes and were unable to    
make steel.                            
It is from this period of time that the
gradual decline of the town started. In
the 30's to help a depressed area Ebbw 
Vale steelworks (Richard Thomas and    
Baldwins) was moved from Gorseinon.This
works was eventually to employ 10,000  
men and bring prosperity back to the   
area.
