		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ANDREW</title>
		<content>{June 18th 1985.}I get up and listen to
 the news, U.S. plane been hijacked in 
 Beirut, car bomb,74 people killed and 
 England won the 1st test match against
 Australia. Get to school at 9.0 a.m . 
 8 lessons all together but they're    
 really terrible because we get too    
 much work. I like Music and Maths     
 because they are very easy and German 
 until the teacher freaks.             
 Dinner hour is not too bad because we 
 can do sports if we want to or go down
 to town. Get home at 4.20 change from 
 school uniform which consists of a    
 black blazer, trousers, shoes , a grey
 shirt and school tie.                 
 Watch T.V. and saw Minder which is ace
 and a couple of other programmes. Also
 watched 9.0 o'clock news. Plane still 
 hijacked. Then went to bed.
