		<content>     {Alway Estate}is the name of a    
 council owned housing estate in       
 Newport. It was built about forty     
 years ago and now Newport Borough     
 Council is going to spend a lot of    
 money modernising the houses there.   
 This needs to be done urgently, which 
 is why the scheme is called the{Alway 
{Priority Estate Project. }            
      As part of the project, two open 
 spaces in the estate are to be turned 
 into children's playground. These are 
 in Parry Drive and Mount Bax.         
      Some people involved with this   
 scheme have visited our school,       
 Hartridge Comprehensive, and told us  
 that we could enter a competition to  
 design these playgrounds.  They left  
 us catalogues to show what sort of    
 play-things we could use.  We have    
 been drawing our plans in our normal  
 Art Lessons.                          </content>
