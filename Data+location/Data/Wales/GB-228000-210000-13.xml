		<title>13LAW AND ORDER IN LAUGHARNE</title>
		<content> Most of the crime recorded in         
 Laugharne is of a petty nature, with  
 small amounts of shoplifting and      
 theft.  Drugs, growing and using, is a
 small but obviously serious problem.  
 After-hours drinking, rowdiness,      
 fighting and drink-related domestic   
 violence is about average.  Motoring  
 offences appear occasionally as do    
 thefts of car badges and joyriding,   
 mostly by youngsters.  One fatality   
 occurred as a result of a car crash   
 recently.  Vandalism is usually in the
 form of destruction of trees and      
 playing field equipment but one       
 holiday home had its roof damaged     
 by stones.  A policeman is available  
 in Laugharne on Wednesday evenings    
 between 6 and 7 pm for consultation   
 but very little use is made of this   
 service, as it is rather public.      
 Complaints and enquiries go to HQ.    </content>
