    There are very small villages with 
 a mixture of old cottages, renovated  
 and extended, and larger new buildings
 all in very good repair, and a number 
 of scattered farm houses throughout   
 the lowland area and along the lower  
 slopes of the hills, but no habitation
 in the moorland or mountain region of 
 the section.                          
                                       
   TRANSPORT (Roads).                  
    There are a network of 'B class'   
 narrow roads and lanes, single track  
 in places, with infrequent passing    
 places, linking the villages, and     
 reasonable roads, giving access to the
 larger farms, but only one road over  
 the mountain area between the A541 and
 the tiny village of Pentre'r Felin,   
 this is narrow, winding and very steep
 in places, but in good condition.     </content>
