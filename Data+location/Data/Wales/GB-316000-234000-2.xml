		<content>  AN ISOLATED UPLAND CHURCH,LLANELIEU  
 CHURCH WAS BUILT IN MEDIEVAL TIMES TO 
 SERVE THE SCATTERED FARMING COMMUNITY,
 MUCH STILL REMAINS OF THE ORIGINAL    
 STRUCTURE INCLUDING PART OF THE ROOD  
 SCREEN, WHILE IT ALSO ACTS AS HOME FOR
 THE TWO CROSSES OF THE DARK AGES.     
 TODAY ITS ROLE HAS BEEN LARGELY       
 DESTROYED BY CHANGES IN FARMING       
 PATTERNS WHICH HAVE REDUCED THE SIZE  
 OF THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES AND BY     
 MODERN TRANSPORT. IT IS STILL, WITH   
 THE HELP OF GRANTS, KEPT OPEN AND     
 IN GOOD REPAIR BUT ITS PASTORAL ROLE  
 IS REPLACED BY TALGARTH PARISH WHICH  
 SHARES ITS VICAR.  ITS ROLE AS A      
 TOURIST ATTRACTION IS MINIMISED BY ITS
 ISOLATION. IT HAS SERVED AS A SETTING 
 FOR A TELEVISION PLAY. ITS FUTURE     
 REMAINS UNCERTAIN; LARGELY REPLACED   
 YET STILL VALUED FOR SENTIMENTAL      
 REASONS AND HISTORICAL INTEREST.      </content>
