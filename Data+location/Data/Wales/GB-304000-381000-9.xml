		<content> In a survey into the eating and       
 drinking preferences of a group of    
 9-10 year old children the following  
 results were noticed.The favourite    
 breakfast was cereals,with cornflakes 
 being the most popular.No-one had any 
 form of cooked breakfast.Surprisingly 
 perhaps, roast lamb was the most      
 popular meat,followed closely by roast
 pork and chicken.Beef burgers and     
 sausages received very few votes.     
 Carrots were the favourite vegetable  
 with only 4% liking a green vegetable.
 Cucumber was top among salad          
 vegetables but only just. Apples and  
 grapes were equally favourite fruits, 
 with numerous other fruits receiving a
 few votes each.Mars bars were the     
 favourite sweet.Only two drinks       
 received consideration,fizzy drinks   
 (e.g. Coke and Lemonade)taking 95% of 
 the votes,the rest going for milk.    </content>
