		<content>{Caldicot}is one of the parishes of the
{Monmouth District}and is situated in  
 the South East corner of {Gwent}mid   
 way between the towns of{Chepstow}and 
{Newport.}Thirty years ago it was just 
 a village but with the building of    
{Llanwern}Steelworks it has grown into 
 quite a large town.                   
    It is crossed by the M4, by the    
 main South Wales to the Midlands rail 
 routes and by the main South Wales to 
 London railway which enters the       
 western approach of the{Severn Tunnel.
 The main part of Caldicot lies        
 between the Railway and the M4. To the
 South is the estuary of the{River     
{Severn}surrounded by low pasturelands.
 Caldicot is bound on the West side by{
{Rogiet}and quite a large area of      
 woodland.
