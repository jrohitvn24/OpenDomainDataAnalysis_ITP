		<title>18LEISURE - CLYDACH VALE</title>
		<content>   Typical of the leisure facilities of
 the area are the Cambrian Welfare Park
 and the Workingmen's Club.  The Park  
 is owned by the Rhondda Borough       
 Council and stands in an elevated     
 position overlooking Clydach Vale. It 
 has a large rugby field and new chang-
 ing rooms and showers were built this 
 year.  There is a fine bowling green, 
 three tennis courts and a children's  
 small pool is in use.                 
   The Workingmen's club is six years  
 old and has 450 members. Entertainment
 include bingo, darts, snooker,        
 skittles, disco and cabaret. Â£4,000   
 per month is needed to finance the    
 club. More gentlemen than ladies use  
 the facilities of the club. Ladies are
 allowed upstairs but downstairs is    
 strictly for the men.
