		<content> The nature of the land depends on the 
 resistance of the rock.Hard Cefn      
 sandstone form highland and soft shale
 forms lowland.This surface is incised 
 by rivers which erode valleys.Most    
 land is managed but some has reverted 
 to grass,gorse,broom and birch        
 woodland eg. the NSM workings.There is
 a variety of birds and small          
 mammals.Monsanto,a large chemical     
 works in Cefn,employs a number of     
 people.The brickworks have been       
 replaced by small industrial estates. 
 Houses are mainly made from local     
 materials.Most of the old houses were 
 built around 1900.There are a few     
 modern housing estates.Transport is   
 mainly cars but there are train and   
 bus services.Farming is mainly cattle 
 but there are some sheep.The          
 vegetation is mainly grass for        
 grazing.                              </content>
