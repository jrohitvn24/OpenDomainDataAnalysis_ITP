		<title>04Industry: Phurnacite Plant.</title>
		<content> The Phurnacite plant is situated in   
 Aberaman.  The plant went into        
 production in 1942 and presently      
 employs approximately 900 men.  It    
 makes a high grade domestic smokeless 
 fuel called "Phurnacite", using dry   
 steam coal produced by local          
 collieries.  Phurnacite is distributed
 throughout the British Isles, its     
 biggest market is London and          
 South-East England                    
                                       
 Over recent years the pollution       
 emitted from the Plant has increased, 
 because the process has fallen into   
 disrepair.  This has caused friction  
 between the local residents and the   
 owners National Smokeless Fuels.      
 Despite dust suppression processes,the
 emission of dust, smells and airborne 
 tar, they have to be suffered  because
 of the jobs at stake.                 </content>
