          ********************         
    The{saltmarshes}which were         
 created by the silting up of the{     
{River Dee,}have been helped to spread 
 quickly by the growth of grass. This  
 grass is called{Sartina}and was       
 planted on the Welsh side of the river
 in the{1920's}to bind the sand        
 together for land reclamation. It was 
 not successful but somehow appeared in
 the Cheshire side at{Gayton}where  it 
 was not wanted but was successful. It 
 has bound together the sand and       
 replaced the sea shore with a         
 saltmarsh from Gayton to Parkgate.
