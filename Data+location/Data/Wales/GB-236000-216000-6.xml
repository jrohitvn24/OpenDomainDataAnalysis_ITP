		<content> The sewerage works for Carmarthen     
 comes into our area.  It is built on  
 flat land at Par-y-splotts near the   
 River Towy.  The sewerage is pumped   
 from Carmarthen to a hugh tank.  Here 
 it is allowed to settle.  The residue 
 sinks to the bottom and the water     
 flows by gravity to the river.  The   
 residue is pumped to a drying unit.   
 Here it is pressed between high       
 plates.  When it is pefectly dry it is
 stored.  Farmers are allowed to use it
 on their fields.  It is taken out to  
 them in lorries.
