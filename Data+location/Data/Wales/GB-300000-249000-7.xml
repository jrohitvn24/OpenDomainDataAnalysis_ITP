 houses in Builth,but the scenery has  
 not changed.She generally likes       
 Builth,except for the vandalism, and  
 there is not much of that.            
  She does all of her shopping in      
 Builth.She uses the buses when they   
 run,but thinks that there are not     
 enough of them                        
 A GENTLEMAN:  He lives on the         
 outskirts of Builth (W).He thinks that
 the people and buildings have changed 
 a lot.He likes Builth because there is
 no pollution. He does all of his food 
 shopping in Builth,but finds prices   
 very expensive.He travels by bus to   
 Hereford,to shop for clothes.He thinks
 Builth is a homely community.         </content>
