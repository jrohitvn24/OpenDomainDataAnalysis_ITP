		<content> Bethan Vale lives in the "Folly",     
 Llanteg.  She writes "I am 8 years    
 old. I get up at 8 o'clock.  I have a 
 cat and a dog.  My favourite sweets   
 are all kinds except mints.  Before   
 going to Stepaside School I went to   
 Amroth School.  I moved because it had
 to close because there were not enough
 pupils in it."  Christian is 7.  He   
 writes "I was in Amroth School and I  
 moved because there were not enough   
 pupils in Amroth School.  Amroth      
 School closed in l982.  The number of 
 pupils had fallen to about l2.  Some  
 came to Stepaside School and some went
 to other schools.  There were two     
 teachers in that school and one moved 
 to Stepaside."
