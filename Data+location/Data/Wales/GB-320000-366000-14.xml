		<content> Deciduous trees ie oak, ash, beech    
 chestnut and coniferous pines are     
 planted in small specie blocks to be  
 cut and sold for furniture and paper  
 pulp.Rare pines have also been        
 planted for ornamental purposes       
{EMPLOYMENT}The area has traditionally 
 relied upon farming, sand and gravel  
 quarrying, lead mining and brick      
 manufacture as a major source of      
 employment. Now only farming, the     
 Rhosesmor Sand and Gravel quarry and  
 the Gwysaney Hall estate provide a    
 limited number of local jobs. New jobs
 have been created though by new light 
 industries attracted onto the         
 industrial estate, Rhydymwyn, through 
 government concessions and grants, by 
 the more pleasant and cleaner         
 environment,the pool of labour formed 
 through unemployement and the quick   
 link to the motorway system.          </content>
