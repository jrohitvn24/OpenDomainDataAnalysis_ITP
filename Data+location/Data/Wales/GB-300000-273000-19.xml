		<title>19Living in Bwlchysarnau</title>
		<content> In Bwlchysarnau it is very quiet and  
 peaceful.It is a very pleasant place  
 to live, but there are a few          
 disadvantages. There are no shops,    
 there are no pubs for adults and it   
 can be very boring for young people   
 because there isn't a lot to do in the
 evenings.                             
    One of the worst things is that    
 Bwlchysarnau is on a hill so you have 
 to walk up to see your friends!       
    The good thing is that it snows a  
 lot and you miss school, and there are
 some good hills for sledging. As it is
 a small village you know all the      
 neighbours and they are very friendly.
