		<content>     A single track railway line runs  
 through the area along the east bank  
 of the River Conwy.  The line is open 
 to passengers and freight and connects
 Llandudno Junction with Blaenau       
 Ffestiniog, whilst a freight only spur
 leads on to serve Trawsfynydd nuclear 
 power station. At Blaenau the line    
 connects with the privately owned     
 Ffestiniog narrow guage railway thus  
 completing an interesting west-north  
 coast link through spectacular        
 scenary. The line is served by nine   
 passenger trains a day in summer and  
 five in winter running in both        
 directions. Connections with the main 
 BR network are made at Llandudno      
 Junction. The nearest station is      
 Tal-y-cafn just to the south of the   
 Henryd area.
