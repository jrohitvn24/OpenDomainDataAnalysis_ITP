		<title>20A CHILD'S LIFE IN DUNVANT</title>
		<content> My name is Jonathan and I am 11 years 
 old.This morning I woke up about      
 7am..It was too early to get up so I  
 read a book called 'The Phantom       
 Freighter'.Later I got up and had a   
 breakfast of porridge and toast.At    
 8.45 I went to school which starts at 
 9.15.When I got to school I went for a
 swimming lesson.Later I had a dinner  
 of chicken and chips.Afterwards I did 
 some mathematics then we had games,   
 playing rugby and football.The school 
 day ends at 3-45pm.When I got home I  
 watched television.I like watching a  
 comedy called 'Full House' and a quiz 
 programme called 'Block Busters'.About
 5.30 my Dad arrived home from Swansea 
 University where he works and then we 
 had tea consisting of spaghetti on    
 toast.Later I went to bed and read for
 about half an hour before going to    
 sleep.                                </content>
