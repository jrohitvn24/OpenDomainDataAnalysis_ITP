		<content> This block contains the two secondary 
 schools for the Abertillery distict,  
 three infant schools,one primary      
 school and one junior school.A{new    
{comprehensive school}to replace the   
 present two is being built on         
 reclaimed colliery land in{Cwmtillery.
                                       
 The system of schooling in current use
 is infant schooling from 'rising five'
 to seven,junior school from seven to  
 eleven and then junior comprehensive  
 to the age of fourteen.After this the 
 pupils must travel to Nantyglo to     
 attend the senior comprehensive       
 school.                               
 The new comprehensive will replace the
 Roseheyworth and Gelli Crug           
 comprehensives and the latter will    
 become a primary school.This will then
 release the present primary school for
 redevelopment.                        </content>
