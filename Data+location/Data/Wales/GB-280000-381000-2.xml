		<content>{Penrhynside }is an old fashioned      
 village with just one narrow street   
 with houses on both sides. It has     
 three{chapels} and two {pubs} and one 
 village{shop.}The shop has been owned 
 by the same family for over fifty     
 years. It still has old fashioned     
 scales and weights. My {house}used to 
 be a shop -  I think maybe two shops  
 with two families living above them.  
 The iron bar for the shop sign is     
 still outside my bedroom window. The  
 kitchen walls are rough rock because  
 the house is built into the hillside. 
 I quite like my house but it is very  
 old. I much prefer modern houses. I   
 would really like to live on Penrhyn  
 Beach Estate.
