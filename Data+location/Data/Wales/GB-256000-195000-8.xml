		<content> Ysgol Gymraeg Pontybrenin is one of   
 the nine Welsh schools in West        
 Glamorgan.Unlike the village school   
 the children that come to our school  
 come from a lot of different villages 
 around the area.All the children are  
 there because their parents chose the 
 school.The parents especially want    
 their children to be able to speak,to 
 write,and to read well in the Welsh   
 language.                             
       The school is organised into    
 three parts.The Nursery classes,the   
 infants,and the juniors.Children can  
 begin school when they are 3yrs old   
 and they leave to attend the new Welsh
 Language secondary school,'Bro Gwyr'  
 when they are 11 years of age.        
       A special part of the school is 
 to compete in the Urdd.Every Tuesday  
 afternoon a branch of the Urdd is ran 
 by teachers after school.{            </content>
