		<title>08Farming in Magor</title>
		<content>  Magor is an excellant site for       
 farming because the ground is very    
 flat.Five hundred years ago the monks 
 from Tinten Abbey drained the land.   
 Farmers still drain the land today.   
 Beef and dairy farming are the        
 main forms of agriculture practiced in
 the area.                             
  Beef is the main form of produce.The 
 cows are fattened then slaughtered    
 for their meat.                       
  Dairy farmers milk their cows twice a
 day and take the milk to St.Mellons.  
 In the summer the farmer cuts a grass 
 crop called Silage for his cows to eat
 during the winter,he also grows hay.  
  Grain crops are also grown,they are  
 Barley ,Wheat and Maize.Combine       
 harvesters come around and cut the    
 crops.It's because of the large       
 machines such as combine harvesters   
 that fields have been made bigger.    </content>
