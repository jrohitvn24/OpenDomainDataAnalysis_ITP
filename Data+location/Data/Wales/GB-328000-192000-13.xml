		<title>13Industry and Work in Cwmbran</title>
		<content>   An industrial revolution has        
 transformed Cwmbran. The mines and    
 quarries have been replaced by a great
 diversity of successful industries.   
   The valley's principal products are 
 now micro-processors and computer     
 equipment, dairy machinery, valves,   
 biscuits, cosmetics, clothes and motor
 components.                           
   A large proportion of our fathers   
 are employed, the majority in local   
 factories where they are on shift-work
 About half of our mothers work, mostly
 in schools and shops.                 
   Most of our fathers travel to their 
 work by car,while our mothers walk,   
 one or two use the bus.               
   Nearly everyone finds the work they 
 do interesting or very interesting and
 all but two were happy in their job.
