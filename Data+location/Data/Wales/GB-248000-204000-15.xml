		<title>15Superstitions,Five Roads</title>
		<content> At the beginning of the last century  
 the people of five roads had little   
 chance of education,as a result they  
 were very superstitious.It was a sign 
 that someone would die in the future  
 if a cock was heard crowing at night  
 or if a comet passed over the village.
 If you saw a Magpie in your path you  
 could expect bad luck,if you saw two  
 crows you would receive good luck.    
 Some people would even kill a snake   
 before easter to ensure good luck for 
 the rest of the year.People also tell 
 of a white lady who travels along the 
 funeral route of someone about to die.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
