		<title>07Population Changes in Dinas</title>
		<content> In {1951}there was quite a lot of     
 people living{Dinas} - to be exact    
 there was{1788}.That figure dropped in
{ 10}years to {1697}.Then it decreased 
 a long way in {1971}to {1530}.I think 
 people went out of Dinas during that  
 period because there weren't many     
 jobs for them in the area so they     
 moved to other areas to look for work.
      However,after that,the{1981}     
 census results show that the number   
 increases a great deal to{1749}.I     
 think people came back to Dinas when  
 they retired and came back to live    
 here to enjoy their last years to     
 remember where they lived when they   
 were a child.Also many outsiders came 
 here live because it is such a        
 pleasant area.Experts predict that by 
 the year{2001}the population of dinas 
 area will be about {1935}.
