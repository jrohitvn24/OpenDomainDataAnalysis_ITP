  Bwlchgwyn is a village about five and
 a half miles to the west of Wrexham.It
 is in the hills above the town.The    
 hills form a large semi-circle around 
 the main town below.  Bwlchgwyn is at 
 the northern end of this semi-circle, 
 on the edge of moorland.              
 The village itself is built on        
 sandstone with coal measure outcrops  
 to the east.The rocks around the      
 village are highly mineralised and    
 within the sandstone may be found     
 lead ore, mined in years gone by.     
 Silica,fireclay,iron-ore,coal and     
 limestone have also been quarried     
 around the area.Sandstone is still    
 quarried at a nearby location.        
  The name of Bwlchgwyn literally means
 "White Gap" or "White Pass",and is    
 normally thought to refer to the white
 colour of the rocks above the village.</content>
