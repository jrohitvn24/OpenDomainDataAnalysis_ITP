		<title>13Language in Caerhun Parish</title>
		<content> Welsh is the language of this area.   
 Many English people live here so      
 English is widely spoken but Welsh    
 language classes are well-attended.   
 The Welsh language and culture has    
 revived lately. All are encouraged to 
 speak their native tongue and the     
 minutes of local council meetings are 
 kept in Welsh. Rowen village derives  
 its name from the white gravel carried
 down from the hills by the River Ro:  
 gravel - 'Gro', mutated to 'Ro'; white
 - 'Gwyn', mutated and in its feminine 
 form 'Wen': hence 'Rowen'.The names of
 some farmsteads are historical e.g.   
 'Tyddyn Du', a black cottage built and
 its land pegged out in one day. 'Maen 
 y Bardd' means Pillar of the Bard.    
 Bryn Cynhadledd or Hill of Conference 
 is an open meeting place which        
 possibly dates back to prehistoric    
 times.                                </content>
