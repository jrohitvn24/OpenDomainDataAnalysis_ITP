		<content>{Ball tag}is a good and exciting game. 
 You have one ball.  The person who is 
 'on it' has to hit someone with the   
 ball.  The person who has been hit by 
 the ball is then 'on it'.  The people 
 who are not 'on it' can only pick up  
 the ball with their wrists. {War}is a 
 good game as well.  There are sides,  
 sometimes British, sometimes German or
 American.  In winter we sometimes have
{snowball fights.}One day I had a      
 snowball down my back.  Also in winter
 we play {skidding on the ice; }we go  
 at about 50mph.
