		<title>09TONMAWR - RELIGION</title>
		<content> The{Church in Wales}is represented by 
 a vicar whose parish is split between 
 Tonmawr and Pontrhydyfen, a           
 neighbouring village. The church      
 itself is located in what used to be  
 the old school house, before the      
 present school was built.             
 Nonconformist religious needs are met 
 by{The Mission}which is run by its    
 self elected pastor, the Reverand Len 
 Sparkes. Len is an collier who        
 decided that religion was more        
 important to him than working in the  
 mines. As a result he retired from    
 work to run the Mission. A sunday     
 school, an weekly evening club for    
 children and an annual trip to the    
 seaside are part of Mission life.     
 At one time the village supported two 
 or three chapels, which are now       
 demolished.                           
                                       </content>
