		<title>05Naming the Mumbles Lifeboat</title>
		<content> On July 3rd 1985 Mumbles Lifeboat was 
 named by HRH the Duke of Kent. He     
 named her"Ethel Anne Measures".Mrs.   
 Heard took Victoria &amp; Fiona to see    
 this new Lifeboat being named.The     
 Mumbles Lifeboat station &amp; the        
 Coastguard station have been waiting  
 for 4 years for a new Lifeboat and at 
 last local people have managed to     
 raise enough money,Â£230,000.The Duke  
 arrived by helicopter &amp; car at 11:00, 
 half an hour late.Then we had a       
 service for the lifeboatmen.Around    
 12:00 the Duke made his speech &amp; then 
 smashed the champagne against the     
 starboard bows.The lifeboat was named 
 after Ethel Anne Measures who gave    
 Â£200,000 towards it.We interviewed a  
 lifeboatman &amp; he said that the new    
 boat was faster,better equipped &amp; had 
 more room.He has been in the crew for 
 3 years.by Fiona Court&amp; Victoria Moore</content>
