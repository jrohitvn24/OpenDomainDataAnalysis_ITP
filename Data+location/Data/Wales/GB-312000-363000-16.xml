    He was considered to be one of the 
 most important of Welsh poets and was 
 rector of St.Cynhafals church in 1749.
 His tomb is to be found outside to    
 west window of the church.            
   WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.                 
    The famous romantic poet was a     
 frequent visitor to the house adjacent
 to St.Cynhafals church. The house was 
 built for the Jones family, whose son 
 Robert, was a great friend of the     
 poet, and his companion on many       
 walking tours.
