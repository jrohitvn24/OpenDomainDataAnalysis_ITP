		<content> St Tygwydd's church is Llandygwyd is  
 protestant, church of Wales, in the   
 diocese of St David's.  It used to    
 have its own Vicar but now shares a   
 Vicar with four other churches in     
 three parishes ad he takes four       
 services each Sunday.  Most of the    
 people's first language is Welsh so   
 half the services are in Welsh ad half
 in English.  Most people in the are   
 are Protestant, few are Roman         
 Catholics.  In St Tygwydd's church    
 there are sixty seven members, but    
 only about forty attend church on a   
 regular basis.  Some people attend    
 non-conformist chapels the principal  
 being the congregationalist.  The     
 church building needs constant        
 mainenance and in the past ten years  
 the tower has had to be removed. Â£1200
 was spent recently on renewing the    
 lead in the staing glass windows.     </content>
