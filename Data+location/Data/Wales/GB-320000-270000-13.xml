		<content>  There are many stories of            
 supernatuaral happenings in this      
 village. Sometimes they are invented  
 to test the gullible; one, current for
 about 18 months, involves a man with  
 cloven hooves and a tail lying in wait
 on a farm gate in the Dingle and      
 sometimes they are based on local     
 tragedies, the white clad woman who   
 passes the pool where someone is said 
 to have drowned herself for love.     
  A more interesting tale, and much    
 older, is that of the Wild Black Dog  
 with Fiery Eyes which is said to haunt
 the Cross_Roads at Four Ashes. This   
 story has been told for many years and
 not only to outsiders who may not     
 understand Radnorshire deadpan        
 humour.
