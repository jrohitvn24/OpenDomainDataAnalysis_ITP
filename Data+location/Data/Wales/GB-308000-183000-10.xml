		<title>10FAMILY LIFE - UNEMPLOYED 1</title>
		<content> One of the most depressing things for 
 the local unemployed men is to hear   
 those with jobs complaining about     
 those on the dole. They seem to think 
 we are on the dole out of choice.     
 I was made redundant three years ago  
 and as an unskilled man I am finding  
 it impossible to find a nother job    
 when there are so many others in the  
 same position.                        
 It certainly affects my family. I have
 three children and live in a          
 semi-detached council house. I had    
 hoped to buy the house from the       
 council but that is out of the        
 question now.                         
 Since becoming unemployed life has    
 changed drastically. We cannot afford 
 holidays, new clothes or new things   
 for the house. I feel bad at Christmas
 because we cannot give the children   
 what other children get.              </content>
