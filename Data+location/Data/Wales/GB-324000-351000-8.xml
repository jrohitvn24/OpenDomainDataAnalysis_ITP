		<title>08Caves in Minera Mountain</title>
		<content>  Because the mountain is mainly formed
 of limestone which is dissolved by    
 acid water there are many caves and   
 underground passages which stretch for
 miles.It is dangerous to explore these
 but there are two local potholing     
 clubs whose members go down regularly 
 wearing special safety equipment.     
  Down in the underground passages it  
 is pitch black and the temperature    
 usually stays about 48 Farenheit.One  
 of these caves is big enough to take  
 our school with room to spare.        
  Lead miners wrote their names in wet 
 clay over a hundred years ago and this
 is perfectly preserved because there  
 are no changes of weather.            
  There are bats and other creatures in
 some of the caves but most creatures  
 like to stay where there is some      
 day light.                            
                                       </content>
