		<title>20Attitudes. My Home Town</title>
		<content> I like living in Chepstow because I   
 have many friends,there are plenty of 
 things to do and the houses where I   
 live are very nice and comfortable.   
 There is a Leiesure Centre up the road
 and I often go swimming there.There   
 are two parks and lots of shops.I     
 particulary like the gift shops as    
 well as the sweet shops.There is a    
 castle and a museum you vist.There are
 lots of things in the museum from     
 mangles to cameras and clothes and it 
 is a lovely place to wander around.   
 When I grow up I think I will move    
 away from Chepstow although it is a   
 nice place but I probably will be sad 
 leaving after living here for so many 
 years.
