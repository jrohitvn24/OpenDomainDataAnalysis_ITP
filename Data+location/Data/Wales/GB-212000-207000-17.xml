		<title>17Kilgetty Coal Yard.</title>
		<content> We spoke to Carolyn Hargrave and Mr.  
 Thomas the manager.  Coal used to be  
 brought to the yard by rail and this  
 finished in l964.  There was also a   
 Cattle Market near there which closed 
 some l5 years ago.  Coal is now       
 brought from England and Wales to the 
 yard by lorry.  Their coal round      
 extends from Carmarthen to Angle.  l2 
 people work there.  They do a door to 
 door service.  Most people buy about 3
 tons per year in total but may buy 5  
 l cwt. bags at a time.  Some 'phone to
 order coal but they also call in      
 houses on a regular basis.  The last  
 years miners strike did not affect    
 them because they are an N.C.B.       
 company. Gypsies from Kilgetty common 
 for example Mr. Probert aged 86 pushes
 a pram to collect coal.  They sell    
 about l50 tons per week.  They have   
 about ll types of coal.               </content>
