		<title>13SUBMARINE "RESURGAM," RHYL</title>
		<content>  The "Resurgam" submarine was built in
 Birkenhead in 1879. It sank just off  
 the Foryd harbour, Rhyl, in 1881. It  
 was the first ever mechanical         
 submarine to be built. Recently naval 
 divers have been carrying out tests on
 the submarine and have sent down echo 
 sounder traces and the measurements   
 seem to be the same as the "Resurgam."
 Commander R. Compton-Hall said, "She  
 will be in very bad condition when she
 is raised." She will be restored in   
 Gosport. The shipbuilders charged     
 Â£1,600 + Â£50 launching fee.           
  This summer the local newspapers have
 carried accounts of the plans to try  
 and raise this submarine.
