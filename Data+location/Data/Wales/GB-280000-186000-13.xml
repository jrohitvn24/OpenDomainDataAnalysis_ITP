		<content> The exhibition 'Sculpture in a Country
 Park' was opened in June 1983 and was 
 the first open-air event to be staged 
 by the Welsh Sculpture Trust.  Works  
 by leading sculptors such as Henry    
 Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Elizabeth 
 Frink can be seen and experienced by  
 all visitors regardless of any prior  
 declared interests in the parks richly
 diverse environment.  During the      
 summer, sculptors may be seen actually
 making the work and children are in-  
 vited to participate making sculptures
 for themselves.  After two successful 
 years, the exhibition reached the end 
 of its life.  However, in 1985 over   
 two thirds of the original sculptures 
 remain to form the basis of a semi    
 permanent collection.                 
 The siting of certain sculptures      
 caused much local controversy.
