         One person faces the wall     
 while the rest are at the other end of
 the yard. The person spells out{      
{"L-O-N-D-O-N"}while the others try to 
 get as near as possible to touch the  
 wall. When the person turns around the
 rest freeze. The person tries to make 
 the rest laugh or move without        
 touching them. If they move or laugh  
 they go back to the start. The person 
 then repeats the same words as above  
 until someone touches the wall without
 being seen and says{"London"}If one of
 the rest is seen moving that person   
 goes back to the start and starts     
 again. When someone touches the wall  
 it is their turn to face the wall.
