		<content> Cwmaman Hall was brought into being by
 the voluntary action of those who     
 worked and lived in the tiny mining   
 village of Cwmaman in the 1880's. The 
 hall was opened in March 1892 by Henry
 Austin Bruce, Lord Aberdare.Four years
 later the hall was totally destroyed  
 by fire. Rebuilding was quick and on  
 the day of Queen Victoria's Diamond   
 Jubilee, 10th July 1897 the hall and  
 institute were reopened. During the   
 golden era of the hall, it was the    
 home to a host of clubs, teams and    
 societies but unfortunately today all 
 this has been whittled down.          
   The library, silver band and theatre
 still exist but everything is on a    
 smaller scale. Today the hall is used 
 for the purpose for which it was      
 built, this provides finance for      
 renovation to be carried out.
