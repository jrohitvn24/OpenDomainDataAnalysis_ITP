 We devised a questionnaire to find out
 what people enjoy doing in their      
 leisure time .We noted down our own   
 interests and the interests of three  
 other people.After collecting the     
 information we found that we had      
 details about the leisure pursuits of 
 68 different people.                  
 1. The most popular leisure pursuit in
 our survey was swimming.              
 2.The second most popular leisure     
 pursuit were reading and computer     
 work.                                 
 3.These were closely followed by      
 roller skating, knitting, cycling,    
 drawing, gardening, cooking, sewing,  
 and fishing ,in that order.
