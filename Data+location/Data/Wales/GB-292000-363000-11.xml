 NATURAL HISTORY IN LLANSANNAN.        
    The varied geology of the area,with
 its hills and valleys,allows for a    
 rich local ecology.There is a splendid
 variety of wild life,but very few     
 recognised local natural historians.  
    A wealth of wild flowers can be    
 found along the narrow lane verges,but
 hardly any along the main road verges,
 due to seasonal weed-spraying.All     
 types of indigenous Hawks,Kestrels and
 Owls are present.Curlews and Plovers  
 arrive in the Spring;Herons and       
 Wild-geese nest in the area.All the   
 smaller mammals,exept deer and        
 wildcat,are present.Bats,lizards,grass
 snakes,frogs and toads are often seen 
 whilst the trout is the fish that is  
 usually caught in the local rivers.The
 area recorded is well known for its   
 natural beauty.                       </content>
