		<title>14THE CHURCH AND CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The{church}in this area is led by a   
 retired vicar the Rev P Ralph-Bowman. 
 He looks after Bryngwyn and Llanbedr  
 churches amongst others. The problems 
 of such churches are common to all    
 country churches - the oppressive cost
 of maintaining the building and       
 falling rolls - on the average only 8 
 people go to each service.            
 The{chapel}- there is one in Rhosgoch 
 and one in Painscastle - is optomistic
 . There buildings are simpler and     
 often maintained by members of the    
 congregation, each person giving his  
 or her skills quite unstintingly.
