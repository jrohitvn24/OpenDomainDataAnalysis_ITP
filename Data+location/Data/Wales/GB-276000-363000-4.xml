 The Workers' Educational Association  
 holds a weekly evening class during   
 the winter months on a chosen subject,
 such as local history or wild life.The
 classes are in the Welsh language.    
 Evening classes for learners of the   
 Welsh language are also held in the   
 school during the winter months.      
 Welsh and mathematics  are the only   
 subjects still subsidised by Gwynedd  
 in these days of financial stringency.
  A library is listed in the count of  
 Trefriw facilities, but this is a     
 mobile service,once a month,and should
 not imply a permanent building in the 
 village.
