		<content> The town of Penarth is a result of    
 nineteenth century industrialisation. 
 Iron ore was found and processed in   
 Merthyr Tydfil, a town twenty six     
 miles inland to the north of Cardiff; 
 the foundries were fired by the       
 abundance of coal in the area. A canal
 and later a railway built by Brunel   
 brought the iron and coal to Cardiff  
 where a dock was built. By the 1850's 
 there was an urgent need for more dock
 accommodation as by now Cardiff was   
 the main iron and coal exporting port 
 in the world. In 1856 the Ely Tidal   
 Harbour and Railway Act was passed and
 in 1865 the Penarth Dock was opened.  
 Cogan, the area adjacent to the new   
 dock (03170172) grew from being a tiny
 parish of 28 inhabitants at the 1841  
 census to over 186 in the incomplete  
 census of 1861.
