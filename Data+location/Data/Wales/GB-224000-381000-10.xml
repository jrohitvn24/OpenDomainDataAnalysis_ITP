		<content> Indoor market.                        
 The Honourable William Stanley had the
 Market hall built in 1855.The general 
 idea was to remove all stall holders  
 from the main street as to allow      
 traffic to move without difficulty.   
 Today the market is as busy as ever,it
 is open every day except              
 Tuesdays.There are various stalls     
 selling all manner of goods ,from     
 sweets tofurniture and carpets.       
 Most of the stalls are run by local   
 people,although some travel in from   
 outside the immediate locality to sell
 their wears.                          
 Some stall holders are also  shop     
 owners who supplement their income by 
 having an extra outlet in the market.
