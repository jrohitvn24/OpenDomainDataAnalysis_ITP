		<title>08       CLUBS</title>
		<content>  The majority of the citizens         
 interviewed prefered to join clubs    
 instead of staying at home and        
 watching television.Most agreed that  
 more clubs and societies were required
 in the area,to keep children 'off the 
 streets'.                             
  In Loggerheads there is a Craft Class
 held at the school,which has the      
 ability to accomodate at least 100    
 members.Several girls lead Girl Guides
 in the Mold area.Children of the area 
 are encouraged to attend such Clubs to
 extend their sporting abilities,e.g.  
 Football and Netball Clubs.           
  The survey showed that of the Clubs  
 attended,the majority were in Mold.
