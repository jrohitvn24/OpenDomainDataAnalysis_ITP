		<title>17Transport through Magor</title>
		<content>  Many companies have settled in Magor 
 because of the easy access they have  
 to the M4.Products provided by these  
 companies can be taken to all parts of
 the country simply by using the M4 and
 the motorway network.                 
  If a company needs to send its       
 product abroad Magor has good         
 transport links with Newport Docks and
 the Cardiff Wales Airport.The main    
 London to South Wales railway line    
 also passes through Magor,with the    
 stations of Newport and Cardiff making
 London only hours away.               
  Magor people are lucky because of the
 village's location,companies have     
 brought many jobs to the area.The     
 village itself has benifited because a
 by-pass has been build to cope with   
 all the through traffic and this has  
 ensured the village is kept quiet and 
 fairly traffic free.                  </content>
