		<title>18Events in Leeswood</title>
		<content>   On Saturday 13th of July 1985,      
 Leeswood held its carnival on the     
 Community Centre field at Phoenix     
 Park.There was a magnificent parade   
 with Morris Dancers,Jazz Bands and a  
 Fancy Dress contest.                  
  Euryn Ogwen, a television producer   
 who used to live in Leeswood, opened  
 the carnival.There were many stalls   
 and a fair.                           
   The fair caused some trouble in     
 Leeswood because another fair appeared
 some weeks earlier and there was a lot
 of confusion and ill-feeling involved.
   Gala week held quite a number of    
 events such as a disco on Thursday and
 a pram race where people dressed up   
 with a pram and did an obstacle course
 around Leeswood and a slow bicycle    
 race.Leeswood has an excellent        
 carnival every year.
