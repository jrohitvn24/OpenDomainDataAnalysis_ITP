		<title>13Dolau School</title>
		<content> Dolau school was opened in 1928. The  
 children on the south side of the main
 Railway line came to Dolau and the    
 children on the north side of the     
 railway line went to Llanharan school.
 Dolau school was used as an{          
{"all-through"}school-you came when you
 were 4 and left when you were 14.     
 Now, Dolau is a primary school. It    
 became a primary school at the        
 beginning of September term 1960, at  
 the same time as Llanharry school     
 became a secondaryschool. In 1970     
 Dolau became a bilingual school. The  
 present headmaster Mr.Williams came to
 Dolau school in 1965. The school      
 swimming pool came into use in 1972.  
 There are 127 pupils on the English   
 side, and 178 on the Welsh side. Dolau
 was one of the first{bilingual}schools
 in the area and children travelled    
 here from all over Glamorgan.         </content>
