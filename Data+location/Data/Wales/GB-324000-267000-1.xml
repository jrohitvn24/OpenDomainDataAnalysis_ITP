		<content> The land is used for sheep and cattle 
 farming and some forestry.There is    
 flat good land in the valley of the   
 Lugg (about 0.5km wide) and higher    
 land, up to 400m, occupies two thirds 
 of the block.'B' grade roads follow   
 the southern and eastern edges with   
 scattered farms and cottages along    
 them. The hamlet of Whitton,with      
 church,rectory and school is in the   
 south-east corner on a crossroads.    
 There is another church 2km west of   
 Whitton at Pilleth where there is a   
 big farm called Pilleth Court. The    
 hills are rounded and grass covered   
 being used for grazing while the lower
 land is used for grazing and mowing.  
 There is some fishing in the river    
 which is about 5m wide and 1m deep    
 maximum. The area has not changed     
 greatly for very many years.
