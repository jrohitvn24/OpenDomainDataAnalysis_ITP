 My name is Mark and me and my friend  
 Darren went to interview the          
 farmer.This is what we found out.     
 The farm has 135 acres,with 60 cows   
 and 182 sheep. The cows are mostly    
 friesian and the sheep are Kerry      
 breed.The farmer told us that he      
 ploughed 17 acres and grew barley,with
 one acre of potatoes.He has 7 sheds,2 
 sheep dogs and three tractors.        
  {On two fields are the caravans for  
{visitors.There are 47 caravans and in 
{Summer the farmer is kept very busy   
{with the tourists.                    
   He said that the visitors were      
 mostly quite careful with closing     
 gates and not frightening sheep.Most  
 of them liked to see him milk and do  
 other work on the farm.{
