		<content> Many walkers pass through Rowen in the
 summer months, bound for the Youth    
 Hostel high above the village en route
 to Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen and the           
 surrounding hills. This is one of the 
 approaches to Snowdonia via the       
 Carneddau from Pen-y-Gaer. Touring    
 motorists travel mainly through       
 Llanbedr-y-Cennin although there are  
 also two routes from Rowen, one of    
 them a gated road, to Pen-y-Gaer and  
 Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen. There are parking   
 areas at the end of each road from    
 where climbers and walkers can set    
 out. Coach trips from Llandudno       
 arrive here for evening outings and   
 walks through the village calling for 
 supper or refreshments at the village 
 cafe or at the Ty Gwyn Inn. There are 
 also many holiday homes in this area.
