		<content>                                       
 There are several breeds of{dairy     
{cattle}in Britain.The most important  
 are the{British Friesian,}the{        
{Ayrshire,}the{Dairy Shorthorn,}the{   
{Jersey}and the{Guernsey.}The last two 
 are called the Channel Island breeds  
 and give milk with higher fat content 
 and better cream than the other       
 breeds.                               
  Farmers try to improve their cattle  
 to increase the output of milk.A cow  
 is first milked after it has had its  
 first calf.The amount of milk produced
 from that time until a few weeks      
 before the next calf is born is       
 weighed and added up,this is known as 
 milk recording.The period when a cow  
 can be milked is called the{lactation}
 period.
