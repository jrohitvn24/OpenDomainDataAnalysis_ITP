{Band written by Michael Holder.       
 I have been in the Abertillery Youth  
 Band for two years.There are about 28 
 other members,and the conductor is Mr 
 John Evans.We are in the fourth       
 section and have won three out of     
 three contests.The first was at       
 Swansea in the Brangwyn Hall as a     
 result of this win we now go to       
 represent Wales at the Royal Albert   
 Hall.We have also won concerts at     
 Treorchy and Weston.                  
{My Breakdance Club by Phillip Desmond 
 My teacher at the Breakdance Club I go
 to is Elliott Rickard.It costs 10     
 pence and we are given squash and     
 biscuits.We are taught five moves in  
 an hour.My favourite move is the back 
 caterpillar.I would like to start a   
 popping and hand move club,or be in a 
 film about breakdancing.              </content>
