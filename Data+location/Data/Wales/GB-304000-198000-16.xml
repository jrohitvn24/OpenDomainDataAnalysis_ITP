		<title>16RECREATION IN MOUNTAIN ASH</title>
		<content> Mountain Ash unfortunately has limited
 facilities,and unlike the other two   
 major towns in the Cynon Valley, it   
 has no sports centre.                 
                                       
 It does however have Gwernifor Park   
 opened in 1937.This has tennis courts,
 a bowling green and pavillion,a       
 children's play park and a small out  
 door swimming pool.                   
                                       
 There is also the Recreation ground in
 Woodland Street owned by Mid Glamorgan
 Education Authority which is used by  
 local schools.Mountain Ash Rugby Club 
 also use it for their home games.     
                                       
 In 1957 a new field was laid near     
 Mountain Ash Comprehensive called     
 Caedrawnant,and this accomodates      
 football,cricket and tennis.
