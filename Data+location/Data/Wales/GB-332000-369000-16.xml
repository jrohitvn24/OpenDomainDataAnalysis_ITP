 in and it opens at 7:00pm and closes  
 at 9:30pm.It's open three times a week
 Monday,Wednesday and Thursday.They    
 have all sorts of different games like
 pool,cricket,football,table tennis and
 badminton.On every game you pay 10p   
 deposit.When you have finished you get
 your 10p back.At 8:00pm the tuck shop 
 opens and you can bring money for the 
 tuck shop.They have an art class every
 Wednesday.Sometimes a member brings a 
 guitar.On the playing field we play   
 football matches.Mostly on Saturdays  
 and Sundays people play cricket and   
 rounders.Just at the bottom of the    
 field there are some swings,a slide, a
 see-saw and other things. Sometimes we
 have 5-a-side football. Every year we 
 have a fete on the field,sometimes a  
 little fair comes.
