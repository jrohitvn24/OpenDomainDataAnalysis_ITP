 AREA_ THERE IS ONLY A POTTERY- NO SHOP
 AT ALL SELLING FOOD OF ANY            
 DESCRIPTION. THE VILLAGERS OF VELINDRE
 ARE ABLE TO CATCH A BUS TO THE MARKET 
 TOWN OF HAY ON WYE ON A THURSDAY. IN  
 HAY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GROCERY     
 STORES BUT NO LARGE SHOPS OR          
 SUPERMARKET SO PRICES ARE FAIRLY HIGH.
 THE HAY MARKET IS VERY POPULAR FOR    
 FRUIT, CLOTHES AND SUCH PRODUCTS AS   
 CHEESE AND EGGS.                      
 PAPERS ARE DELIVERED DAILY AS IS MILK 
 AND A BAKER AND GROCER HAVE FITTED    
 VANS WHICH VISIT THE VILLAGE TWICE    
 WEEKLY. ABOUT A THIRD  OF THE         
 INHABITANTS SHOP IN BRECON OR HEREFORD
 AT THE WEEKENDS BUT THOSE WITHOUT CARS
 HAVE LITTLE ALTERNATIVE BUT TO CATCH  
 THE BUS TO HAY.
