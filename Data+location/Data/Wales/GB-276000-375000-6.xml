		<content>   Conwy is a bridging town.There are  
 three forms of transport in the Conwy 
 area.There is a mainline railway and  
 the A55 road to Holyhead passes       
 through the town.There is also a small
 quay where fishing boats and other    
 small craft operate.                  
   Although there is no railway station
 at present in Conwy there is one over 
 the river in Llandudno Junction where 
 there is a branch to Llandudno.       
   Bus services run frequently through 
 Conwy to many major towns in the      
 locality.                             
   In Conwy on the quay, boat trips run
 up and down the river giving scenic   
 views of the surrounding area.Conwy   
 has two car parks but in the summer   
 there is nowhere to park and there is 
 terrible traffic congestion.
