		<content>             {The YFC                  
  A large number of the young people in
 the area go to the YFC which meets at 
 the school every Thursday for 2 hours.
 Many come from over 4 miles away and  
 most can drive. Of the 43 members     
 ranging in age from 11 to 24 most go  
 on to be farmers. At the club they    
 have films, talks and competion work  
 takes up a lot of their time. All the 
 members still live with their parents 
 and most will settle in the country.  
 They appear a happy bunch, content to 
 carry on in the family tradition.     
{             The WI}                  
 The local Womens Institute has 22     
 members of which 75% are from farms.  
 Most of them are quite young but few  
 do not play a traditional roles in    
 their families. They go to the WI for 
 the company and the education that it 
 offers.                               </content>
