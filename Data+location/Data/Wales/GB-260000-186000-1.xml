		<content>   Around the beginning of this century
 Swansea was an important port. Many   
 people came across the Bristol Channel
 to trade and made their homes in      
 Mumbles. Their descendants, such as   
 the Aces and Gammons are still to be  
 found in the village today.           
                                       
  The fishing village has turned into a
 tourist attraction and the fishing    
 boats have been replaced by yachts.   
 Boarding Houses and small Hotels      
 abound and friendly shops cater for   
 the needs of the many visitors who    
 come to enjoy the fantastic scenery   
 and the pleasures of this small       
 seaside resort.
