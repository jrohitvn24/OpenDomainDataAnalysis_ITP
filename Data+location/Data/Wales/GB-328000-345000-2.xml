		<title>02A History of Rhos</title>
		<content> Rhos means heath or moorland.It is    
 associated with the estate            
 Llanerchrugog hall.So we got the name 
 Rhosllanerchrugog which means heathery
 glade.                                
    This name was used at least 400    
 years ago.In 1551it belonged to John  
 ap Hugh ap John ap Ieuan ap Deicws.   
 His son was the first to use Hughes as
 a surname.He owned over 700 acres of  
 the area of Rhos,Johnstown and th     
 surrounding area.                     
    There are three main farms in the  
 area_Grango,Bryn Owen,Tan y Clawdd.   
    Coal was the main industry of the  
 local area during the 19th            
 century.John Wilkinson first used coal
 from the coal mine at Llwyenion.In the
 late 19th century,there was as many as
 50 pits in Rhos,Hafod being the       
 biggest.
