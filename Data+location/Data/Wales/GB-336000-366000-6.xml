		<content>{Destruction of the ancient woodland   
{on St Chad's Road - Report by 1A      
{ }The trees along St Chad's Road are  
 all that remain of an ancient         
 woodland,over 300 years old. The      
 Council plan to destroy the trees in  
 order to replace an old sewage        
 pipeline which lies along the former  
 bank of the River Dee.                
   Many people in Blacon, especially   
 those who live near by feel very      
 strongly about this destruction. Miss 
 Ashton, our science teacher, belongs  
 to 'The Men of the Trees' who have    
 collected 5,000 signatures to protest.
 She has been in the paper and on the  
 radio to gain support.                
   On the 9th July 1985 the councillors
 met at the Town Hall, and decided to  
 accept an alternative plan. The trees 
 which should have been felled on the  
 1st July 1985 have been {SAVED}!      </content>
