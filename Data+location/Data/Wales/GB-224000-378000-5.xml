		<content>    Around our area there are a lot of 
 signs.When we went out we saw lots of 
 these.These are road signs - speed    
 limit , pedestrian , give way etc.Also
 we saw signs concerned with visitors  
 in our area.Some houses had bed and   
 breakfast signs outside them , others 
 had signs advertising their own garden
 produce for sale , others selling     
 fish.There were also signs stating    
 that some areas were private - like   
 the road to Cae Glas and Tre          
 Gof.Hotels have signs outside telling 
 the visitors about their              
 establishment.Some signs were put up  
 by estate agents displaying For Sale -
 Lucas , Bob Parry and Jones and Davis 
 were the most common signs.
