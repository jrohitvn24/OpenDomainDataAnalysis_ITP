		<content> One of the most important things that 
 has happened in this area has been the
 argument in Rhosesmor between the     
 residents and a factory owner. The    
 factory is Tiger Tim which makes fire 
 lighters - this is a material which   
 you put amoung the coal and wood in a 
 grate; it helps to get the fire going.
  There was a factory belonging to     
 Tiger Tim at Rhosesmor but they wanted
 to make it bigger.  The villagers felt
 that this would spoil the village,    
 especially because it was near some   
 old people's bungalows.  The council  
 were supporting the extension of the  
 factory. There was a public meeting in
 the village hall and after a lot of   
 discussion and debating the people of 
 Rhosesmor won the day.  There will be 
 no extension now.
