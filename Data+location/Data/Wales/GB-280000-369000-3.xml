		<title>03Animals of Eglwysbach</title>
		<content> In Eglwysbach there are a lot of wild 
 animals. The most common being rabbits
 but there are not as many as there    
 were long ago, when people used to    
 hunt them. In winter the rabbits go   
 deeper into the ground. There are more
 rabbits than hares.                   
 On the farms there are quite a lot of 
 animals. Because the farms now have   
 silage and cake, there are more       
 animals than there used to be. Only a 
 few farms keep pigs but long ago many 
 villagers kept a pig in the garden. I 
 think that the most common animal on  
 the farm is the cow.                  
 Most of the children in Eglwysbach    
 have a cat or a dog. I do not think   
 that anybody has a budgie here. Nobody
 has a turtle or a guinea-pig either.  
 Long ago nearly everybody had a pet of
 their own.                            
                                       </content>
