 the old times speaking Welsh. Most of 
 the people worked in Rhiw goch,Moel   
 Faen,a clogau, and also some worked on
 the farms.The language of the school  
 was English and in 1920 there were    
 50-70 pupils but by 1950 the number   
 had dropped to 20.Today there are     
 approximately 35 children.            
 A number of people have come to live  
 here and some new houses have been    
 built.The community life changed, in  
 years gone by people where helping    
 each other especially on the          
 farms. Religious worship has changed, 
 in 1919 there where 20 children in    
 Llandynan Sunday School and 20 in

 chapel has closed and Rhewl has only
