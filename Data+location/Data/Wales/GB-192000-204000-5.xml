		<title>05LLANSTADWELL CHURCH</title>
		<content>   {Llanstadwell Church,}dedicated to  
 St.Tudwal, was built in{1291 AD.}Some 
 people think that Tudwal was          
 Scandinavian and he is invoked in     
 Brittany in times of need.            
    The only parts of the original     
 church which remain are the tower and 
 the Holy Water stoop in the Sanctuary.
 The tower is thought to have been a   
 watchtower for it has a commanding    
 view over the Haven. The church was   
 not originally cruciform in shape,    
 having a Nave, a Chancel and a large  
 Transeptal chapel on the north side.  
   In{1853,}it was{rebuilt}and is now  
 orthodox in shape. The church once    
 belonged to St. Thomas's Priory in    
 Haverfordwest. It now belongs to the  
{Church in Wales}and is used as a place
 of worship.
