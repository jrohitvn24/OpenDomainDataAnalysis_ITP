		<title>12Housing in Pontycymer</title>
		<content>  Because of the narrow valley bottom  
 Pontycymer is a linear, ribbon        
 settlement, expanding lengthways along
 the valley floor. The town and houses 
 were built between 1880 and 1912.     
 Before this the area was all rural.   
 With the building of the collieries   
 town and houses the area became       
 industrial though now it is said to be
 semi-rural and is becoming important  
 as a residential area.                
  The houses were built to cater for   
 the mineworkers and were owned by the 
 colliery owners. The houses are nearly
 all typical working class; two or     
 three storeys, small, and built in    
 terraces on the hillsides for economy,
 they are built of locally quarried    
 materials slate, sandstone, brick .   
  With the increase in population of   
 from 1880-1925's trades and shops     
 grew up to cater for the mineworkers. </content>
