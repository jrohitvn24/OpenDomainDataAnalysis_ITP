		<content>{EMPLOYMENT IN OUR AREA.               
  Nearly everybody in our area is      
 employed,about a quarter of those work
 for themselves,the rest work for      
 someone else.Most people work locally 
 and have been employed for a number of
 years.The occupations are varied from 
 nurses to builders and scientists and 
 in most cases require skilled workers.
 Not many work part-time and nearly    
 all who work liked their job. Again   
 not many thought they would get       
 another.The greatest fears for the    
 future were nuclear war,unemployment, 
 violence. The greatest hopes for the  
 future were peace,more pay,more       
 employment for all and a better world 
 for future generations.Most people get
 to work using their own car, quite a  
 lot use the firms car,few use bicycles
 public transport and motor bikes,some 
 walked.                               </content>
