		<title>18LIFESTYLE:COSHESTON/PEMBROKE</title>
		<content> We did a survey on 17 Cosheston       
 Children and 17 Pembroke children.    
 This is what we found out: Most of the
 Cosheston children were not born      
 there. They had moved into the area.  
 Their families lived in more expensive
 houses, they all had cars and 6 of    
 them had 2 cars. There were fewer     
 unemployed Fathers in Cosheston, but  
 more Pembroke Mothers worked.         
   Family sizes were similar (2 or 3   
 children). Every family in both places
 had TVs &amp; record players. Nearly all  
 of them had telephones &amp; bicycles.    
 Half of both groups had videos, but   
 more Pembroke children had computers. 
   The childrens games and hobbies were
 very similar and they all watched a   
 lot of television. Most of them had   
 pets,dogs and cats being most popular.
 Maths and English were the favourite  
 school subjects in both places.       </content>
