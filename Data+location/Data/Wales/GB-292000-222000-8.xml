		<content> Farming is the sole economic activity 
 within the area.                      
 Because of the cool,wet climate       
 virtually the whole area is grassland 
 of one sort or another. The principal 
 use to which the land is put is rear- 
 ing sheep for the fat lamb market.    
 There are some cattle,too, but the    
 area devoted to them is small compared
 with sheep.  The cattle are  predomin-
 antly suckler herds, rearing calves to
 be fattened and sold eventually for   
 beef. Nowadays there are no milking   
 herds in the valley.Fodder crops of   
 hay or silage are most important as   
 winter feed.  At least one half of the
 lower fields are used as meadows for  
 this purpose.
