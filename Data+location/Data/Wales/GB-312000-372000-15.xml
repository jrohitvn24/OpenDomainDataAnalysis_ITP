		<title>15INTERVIEW OF CAERWYS MAYOR 1</title>
		<content> We interveiwed Councillor T.H.Anwyl   
 the retiring Mayor of Caerwys who was 
 born in the town.He told us that he   
 had seen the town double in size with 
 an influx of many english people. Many
 came here to retire.                  
 He does not see many changes in the   
 near future.According to the 10 year  
 plan for the town only gaps can be    
 developed such as the present         
 development in Pendre Orchard.        
 He has noticed a changing attitude to 
 religion.As a methodist he remembers  
 over 60 regular attendants in the     
 chapel compared to about 20-25 today. 
 "The young seem to have lost          
 interest,"he said, but he was pleased 
 to see a choir back at St.Michael's   
 Church.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
