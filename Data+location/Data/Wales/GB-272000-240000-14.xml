		<content> Local economy is dominated by         
 agriculture. Land is in Less Favoured 
 area, so farmers are eligible for full
 livestock subsidies. Most farmers have
 common grazing rights and are members 
 of Mynydd Mallaen Graziers Assoc.     
 Cil-y-cwm is livestock rearing area,  
 predominantly sheep, but also suckler 
 cows, dairy herd and some horses. Some
 farmers supplement income by providing
 camp sitse and offering Bed and       
 Breakfast accommodation. Smaller farms
 have amalgamated into larger units,   
 several of farmhouses have been sold  
 with small parcels of land or have    
 been let as holiday cottages. Some of 
 the less viable farms subcontract     
 labour.Crops-mainly grass,some        
 hay,mostly silage, with Big Bale      
 silage on the increase. No cereals    
 grown. Only root crop is rape for lamb
 fattening.                            </content>
