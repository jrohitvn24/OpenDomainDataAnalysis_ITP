		<content>   Most farms in the area are small and
 mixed.The land is almost completely   
 pasture and because of heavy rainfall 
 ,there is an abundance of grass for   
 livestock.The majority of farmers keep
 a dairy herd but usually have other   
 stock as well.The dairy cows are      
 mostly Freisian but one farm near the 
 village has a herd of Guernseys.The   
 best milking cows are usually put to a
 Friesian bull in the hope of getting a
 heifer calf for the herd but the      
 others are often crossed with a       
 Hereford or Charolais to produce a    
 good beef calf.These are then sold as 
 store cattle.The sheep in the area are
 mainly Welsh Mountain and are often   
 crossed with a Suffolk ram to produce 
 larger lambs.                         
   A few pigs are reared and most      
 farms have some poultry.
