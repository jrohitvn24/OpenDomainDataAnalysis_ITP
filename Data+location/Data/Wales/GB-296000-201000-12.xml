		<content>  Bryn Dar Homes is a home for mentally
 handicapped children.Most of the      
 children there can walk so there are  
 very few children in wheel_chairs.Bryn
 Dar is quite a large building but     
 there aren't a lot of children living 
 there.They have had good results from 
 Bryn Dar.Las summer a boy of 18 years 
 of age left Bryn Dar to become an     
 apprentice for an engineer in England.
 For the enjoyment of the little       
 children,at the back of Bryn Dar there
 is a playground with swings and a     
 roundabout.I was talking to a little  
 girl who lived there,she was going    
 home and she said she loved Bryn Dar.
