		<title>13Ecology of Salem &amp; District</title>
		<content> The overall climate is wet. The "snow 
 line" runs through  the top 4 squares 
 in the area surveyed, at the level of 
 Ffrwd (Approx. 1000ft). In Spring and 
 Autumn the  area is often  above  the 
 cloud level,  therefore misty rain is 
 prevalent. The "dry-wet" line appears 
 to run just below Cil y wern (25/63)- 
 the contrast in the state of the road 
 at this point is very marked.   Salem 
 Village is in  a  clay  basin with no 
 natural drainage except the   Myddyfi 
 stream- so the land is wet and poorly 
 drained.  The   hedgerows  are  still 
 mostly intact,   the  original  small 
 fields remaining,   and so the verges 
 and hedges are prolific  in wild life 
 and flowers.      The common has some 
 unusual plants not found elsewhere in 
 the district. Red deer are frequently 
 seen locally.
