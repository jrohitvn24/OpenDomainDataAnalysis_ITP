		<title>13Laverbread - local delicacy</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 A famous local delicacy sold in       
 Swansea market is{laverbread}or{bara  
{lawr}which is made from boiled and    
 chopped{seaweed.} The edible seaweed  
 used to be collected locally but      
 coastal pollution has put a stop to   
 this and supplies are now brought from
 Pembrokeshire and Scotland.           
 The laverbread is greenish-black in   
 colour and when it is eaten raw people
 compare it with the taste of caviare. 
 However the traditional way of eating 
 it is to shape it into small cakes,   
 roll them in oatmeal and fry in       
 bacon fat.                            
 In recent years a local restaurant    
 owner has started canning laverbread, 
 hoping to encourage people in the rest
 of Britain and even abroad to develop 
 a taste for it.                       </content>
