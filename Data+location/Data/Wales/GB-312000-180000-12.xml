		<title>12Children's Games.</title>
		<content> We play French cricket which is like  
 English cricket but with different    
 rules.There are no wickets and the    
 batsman stays in the same place.The   
 bowler tries to hit his legs with the 
 ball and if he succeeds he is out.If  
 the ball is hit the fielder has to    
 bowl from wherever the ball has       
 landed.Leap Frog is for two or more   
 children.You jump over children who   
 are bending over touching their toes. 
 Once you have jumped over them all,   
 you then bend down yourself so others 
 can jump opver you.Fireball is a game 
 where children form a circle and throw
 a ball around.If you drop the ball you
 must run around the circle and return 
 to your place before the ball has gone
 completely around the circle. In Spot 
 we take it in turns to throw or kick a
 ball at a wall.If you fail you drop   
 out.The last one in is the winner.    </content>
