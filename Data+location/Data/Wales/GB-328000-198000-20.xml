		<title>20OUR ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content>  Being an industrial area,our district
 has been open to the ravages that     
 industry generates.                   
  Coalmining left the scars of         
 slagheaps and chasms where opencast   
 mining had taken place.These areas are
 now being  levelled and landscaped to 
 blend into the environment.           
  Rivers were polluted with minerals   
 and coaldust after the coal was       
 washed.Ironworks added their share to 
 the grime in the water and the air.The
 rivers are cleaner now, sufficient for
 fish stocks to survive.               
   However modern industry still has   
 the potential to spoil the rivers and 
 pollute the air.We as residents must  
 be vigilant to these dangers and      
 endeavour to preserve the right to    
 clean air,land and rivers.Local       
 pressure groups or national           
 organisations can help our aim.       </content>
