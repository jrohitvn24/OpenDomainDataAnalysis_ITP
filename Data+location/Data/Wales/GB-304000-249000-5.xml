		<title>05A TYPICAL DAY IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The playground is full of             
 running,shouting,laughing and         
 sometimes crying children,all playing 
 different games at the same time.Often
 the girls make a nuisance of          
 themselves by coming into our yard and
 trying to join in with cricket or     
 football instead of sticking to       
 netball or skipping.Into school again 
 and soon we are rushing to get a good 
 place in the dinner queue.We have to  
 cross the main road to get to the     
 canteen and we all say "Hello" to Mr  
 Lewis, the lolly-pop man.In the       
 canteen,you mostly hear things        
 like"Oh no,not mushy peas again.I     
 think I'll change to 70p dinners."Soon
 we're back in the playground again.In 
 the afternoons we have a great variety
 of lessons like                       
 art,P.E.,television,science and       
 drama.At ten to four it's home for tea</content>
