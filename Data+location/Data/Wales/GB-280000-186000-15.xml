		<title>15Margam Park The Passion Play</title>
		<content> Every two years the Orangery Gardens  
 at Margam Park provide the setting for
 the Afan Community Associations       
 Passion Play, 'Behold the Man'.       
 Written by Leo Arthurs and directed by
 Ina D. Jones it has established itself
 as an important and unique event in   
 the South Wales calendar.             
 Portraying the last week in the life  
 of Christ, the play brings together   
 actors from local Theatre groups and a
 crowd of 200 from the locality.  Per- 
 formed in the open, the June 1985     
 production saw the fiftieth           
 performance, over 25,000 people having
 witnessed this profoundly moving and  
 unique experience.  For the first in  
 1985 due to extreme weather a perform-
 ance had to be postponed.  Much of    
 Associations profits are donated to   
 local charities.
