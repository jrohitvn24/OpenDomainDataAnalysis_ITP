		<title>12 SHOPPING IN ROGERSTONE</title>
		<content>In four areas there are som groups of  
small shops.These shops do not supply  
everything that the housewives need so 
many make a trip to Newport every week.
   About 15 years ago an Asda          
Superstore was built and it changed the
area's shopping habits.The facilities  
of Asda include a free bus service of  
up to ten buses a day and petrol at    
reasonable prices.The large car park   
has accommodation for 650 cars.        
   The staff in the store are very     
helpful.There are 103 full-time staff  
and 211 part-time. There is an         
unloading bay where 250 lorries deliver
goods each week.                       
   Asda sells food but  clothes,       
electrical goods and small tools are   
also available at low prices.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
