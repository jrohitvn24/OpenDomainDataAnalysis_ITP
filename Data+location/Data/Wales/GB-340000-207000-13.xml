   Lower Penyclawdd farm is a mixed    
 farm of 130 acres.Much of the land is 
 taken up by fertilized grassland,     
 necessary for grazing of the sheep and
 cattle as well as for making silage.  
 The farm has 200 beef cattle in the   
 winter and in June had 120 ewes and 6 
 rams.The machinery on the farm        
 includes two tractors,a manure        
 spreader,fertilizer spreader,tedder   
 for the hay and a rotivator,plus      
 various trailers.                     
  Casual labour and contract labour is 
 used occasionally at busy times such  
 as harvesting and shearing and once a 
 year for hedging but the rest of the  
 year is farmed by the family.         
  Mr. Bayliss,the farmer,attends the   
 weekly market at Abergavenny and also 
 goes to the annual agricultural shows 
 at Stoneleigh and Monmouth.           </content>
