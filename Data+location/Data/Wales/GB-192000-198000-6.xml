		<title>06ORIELTON FIELD CENTRE</title>
		<content> My name is Kate. My sister Samantha   
 and I live in a big Georgian mansion  
 called Orielton. It's a Field Studies 
 Council residential centre now, with  
 Marine Ecology and Geography courses  
 run for sixth formers and University  
 students. There are also a few adult  
 courses in summer. My dad is in       
 charge, and also teaches, while my mum
 looks after the domestic side. As we  
 have over 2000 students each year they
 are very busy. We have a big staff to 
 help, 4 teachers, 2 cooks, a handyman,
 a bursar, 5 domestics and a secretary.
 Every day we provide the students with
 a breakfast and evening meal, plus a  
 packed lunch. I like life at Orielton 
 because we have 128 acres of woodlands
 and small lakes. Dad uses the grounds 
 for some teaching, but we also like   
 people with horses to use the paths,  
 to help keep them open.               </content>
