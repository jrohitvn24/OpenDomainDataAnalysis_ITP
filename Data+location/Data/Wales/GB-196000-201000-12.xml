		<title>12EAST PEMBROKE DOCK- INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> The north-east part of Pembroke Dock  
 has been declared an 'Enterprise zone'
 to attract industry to the area       
 Unemployment has been very high in the
 town for many years and many factories
 including 3 in the block,have closed. 
   The zone uses land reclaimed from   
 the mud of Cosheston Creek.For many   
 years,the area was used as the Council
 rubbish tip.This was recently levelled
 off and covered with soil and it is   
 hoped that new industries will come to
 give much- needed jobs to the area.   
 Some small firms have already opened  
 in the zone.                          
 The land bordering the Cleddau River  
 in the west of the block is owned by  
 the Admiralty and there were many     
 large oil tanks there until recently. 
 H.M.S. Warrior,the first iron-hulled  
 warship (built in 1860) was used as an
 oiling jetty until not long ago.      </content>
