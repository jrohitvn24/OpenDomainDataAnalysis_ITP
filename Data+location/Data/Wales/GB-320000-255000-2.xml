		<title>02GEOGRAPHY OF GLADESTRY AREA</title>
		<content> The area we live in is hilly. The     
 hills are not very high. The Yew Tree 
 Bank is 1000 feet high. We have more  
 hills in the block. Cefn Hir is 1675  
 feet high. Burl Hill is 1402 feet     
 high.                                 
 The hills are smooth. The rock is     
 shale. It breaks very easily.         
 Tractors can be driven up some hills  
 but other hills are too steep. Some   
 valleys are very wide but some are    
 very narrow. We have two brooks,      
 Penfaen Brook and Gilwern Brook. They 
 are small because we are near the     
 source of the streams. There are      
 several dingles. A dingle is a valley.
 A dingle is steep and narrow. Orrell  
 grows in a dingle. Orrell is a tree   
 which is usually called alder. Dingles
 usually have a stream at the bottom.
