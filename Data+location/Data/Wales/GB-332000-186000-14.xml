		<title>14MODEL RAILWAY CLUB,NEWPORT.</title>
		<content>      The Newport Model Railway Club   
 meets at Beechwood House in Beechwood 
 Park. The members have built a very   
 large model railway which is powered  
 by low voltage electricity (12v).     
      The size of the model railway is 
 15m by 3.5m. and it is built on       
 baseboards which can be seperated from
 one another so that the whole model   
 canbe moved. All of the trackwork on  
 the model has been built by the       
 members from rail made from nickel    
 silver soldered to sleepers cut from  
 printed circuit board material.       
      Many model trains run on the     
 layout,which is called "Over Wellmyn".
 Some of them are models of            
 old-fashionmed steam trains, but      
 others are models of the latest trains
 seen on British Rail.  The layout was 
 on show at Newport Museum and Art     
 Gallery recently.                     </content>
