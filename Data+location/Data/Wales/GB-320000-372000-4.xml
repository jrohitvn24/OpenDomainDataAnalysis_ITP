		<content> People like me and my friends wear    
 things like baggy jeans that have zips
 all over them and jumpers with        
 patterns. We like jackets with flaps, 
 leather training shoes and shirts that
 look as if paint has spilt all over   
 them. We wear different coloured socks
 and slip-on shoes which are pointed at
 the front.                            
                                       
 Our hair is short. Long hair used to  
 be in fashion but it is not anymore.  
 Only hippies have long hair, they wear
 jeans or cords which are tight at the 
 top and wide at the bottom. Me and my 
 friends wouldn't be seen dead looking 
 like that.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
