		<content> Among the adult male population in the
 area fishing,both sea and fresh water 
 and gardening are the popular leisure 
 time activities.Many of their wives   
 are involved with Women's Institutes  
 and enjoy knitting and cooking.During 
 the last few years however more women 
 are joining keep-fit groups,dart      
 teams,swimming classes etc.A large    
 number of the younger adult population
 join Youth and Young Farmer's clubs.  
 Few people go to the theatre or cinema
 because of the distance they would    
 have to travel.Home videos are        
 becoming very popular.                
 Due to the number of forests and      
 country lanes in the area motor       
 rallies are popular.                  
 During Summer and early Autumn        
 Flower,Horticultural and Agricultural 
 Shows are popular with people of all  
 ages.                                 </content>
