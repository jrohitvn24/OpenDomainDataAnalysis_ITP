  The survey showed that during school 
 play periods activities differ between
 boys and girls,infants and juniors.   
 These activities range from skipping  
 to chasing games,playing with model   
 cars to football.Now and then a trend 
 appears in which the majority of      
 children will participate,e.g.conkers,
 marbles,hopscotch.                    
  After school a lot of children enjoy 
 riding their bicycles.Many girls have 
 roller skates while the boys play     
 football or,in the summer,cricket.    
 Everyone said they watch some         
 television every day.Many families    
 have a video recorder.                
  Many children are involved with clubs
 or organisations like gym,dance,cubs, 
 guides etc.                           
   The most popular leisure activity   
 among parents is watching television. </content>
