		<content>  There are many unemployed people in  
 our block since the Steel Works,Tin   
 Plate and Copper Works closed down.The
 Borough Council try and attract new   
 industries into the area through the  
 establishment of industrial parks and 
 estates.These are usually sited on    
 land once used by the heavy industries
 of Llanelli.The Council has had some  
 success with their schemes,and are    
 attracting such firms as clothing     
 manufacturers,plastics processing and 
 small engineering units,              
  Employment in the block for women    
 workers is mainly as shop             
 assistants,or in the various Civic    
 Offices and with Banks,Building       
 Societies and Solicitors.There is also
 some employment for women in the light
 industries.Employment for men is on   
 similar lines with the addition of the
 railway and buses.                    </content>
