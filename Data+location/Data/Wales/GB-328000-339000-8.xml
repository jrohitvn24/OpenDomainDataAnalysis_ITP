		<content> THERE IS ONE TOWN IN OUR AREA, IT IS  
 CALLED CHIRK,AND THIS SEWAGE FARM     
 DEALS WITH THE SEWAGE FROM CHIRK AND  
 IS 30 YEARS OLD.THE SITE IS ABOUT 5   
 ACRES .IT USED TO HAVE 2 FULL TIME    
 WORKERS BUT NOW THE 2 MEN WORK        
 VARIOUS SEWAGE FARMS AND COME HERE    
 FOR ONLY 2 HOURS EACH DAY.THE SEWAGE  
 COMES BY UNDERGROUND PIPES.FIRST ALL  
 THE PAPER IS TAKEN OUT AND THE SEWAGE 
 CLEANED A BIT.THEN IT IS PUT INTO A   
 BIG CONCRETE CONTAINER,WHERE IT IS    
 EATEN BY BUGS.THEN THE CLEANED        
 WATER GOES INTO THE RIVER DEE,AND IS  
 EVEN DRUNK BY PEOPLE IN WREXHAM 10    
 HOURS AFTER LEAVING THE SEWAGE FARM.
