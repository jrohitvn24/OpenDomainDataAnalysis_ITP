		<content> This area was studied jointly by the  
 fourth year children of{MORFA JUNIOR  
{SCHOOL }and {HALFWAY C.P.SCHOOL:}both 
 of which are in {LANELLI,DYFED}.      
 The study was made in JULY,1985.      
 The area studied is the eastern side  
 of town (population:c.40,ooo)         
 containing residential areas,         
 agricultural areas,industrial areas,  
 coastal areas and waste land.         
 The area has a history of much heavy  
 industrial growth but in recent years 
 the area has suffered from the        
 problems of the economic recession    
 which has affected the local steel and
 tinplate industry,on which there has  
 been much dependence by the people of 
 the locality.                         
 Recently, however, there has been     
 slight growth in technological        
 manufacturing industry in the         
 locality.                             </content>
