		<content> The area is well-served with good     
 modern roads, with major improvements 
 having been carried out in the late   
 70's and early 80's. The M4 motorway  
 which crosses the block from          
 south-east to north was opened in     
 1978. This helped relieve the traffic 
 bottleneck on the A48 as it passed    
 through{Pontarddulais.                
                                       
 Another major road improvement was the
 re-alignment of the A4173 south-west  
 from junction 48 of the M4 and        
 by-passing the village of{Llangennech.
 Traffic is now very heavy on this road
 as it is the main route to serve the  
 British Steel Corporation plant at    
 Trostre, the NCB mine at Cynheidre,   
 the Open cast mines at Trimsaran and  
 the old and new industries of the town
 of Llanelli.
