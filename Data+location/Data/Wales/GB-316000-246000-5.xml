 They cook (few convenience foods),    
 sew, enter competions, drive, look    
 after the children and take part in   
 village life.In the survey only one   
 had a degree; only six live in post   
 1960 houses. They live a temperate    
 life, supporting their husbands in the
 farm way of life and most had children
 Quite a few go on holiday if only for 
 a short time each year. Music plays   
 quite a big part in their lives; they 
 may sing in a choir, play the piano or
 encourage their family to take part in
 the local Eisteddfod or the           
 Anniversary.(Surveyed at a WI meeting)
{ Fathers.                             
 The men did not have such diverse     
 interests as the women, farming was   
 their main concern. Clubs they joined,
 papers they read and social gatherings
 were all concerned with farming.      </content>
