		<title>02LAMPHEY PALACE (LAMPHEY)</title>
		<content> Lamphey Palace was the country house  
 of the Bishop of St.David's.The Bishop
 was also the Lord of Lamphey.He owned 
 all the land and all the people had to
 work for him.If they disobeyed him    
 they would be punished on the green   
 outside the church.In the grounds were
 fish ponds.The Bishop would fish      
 there.Everyone had to eat fish three  
 days a week.The waste from the        
 kitchens was thrown into a stream and 
 would float to the fish ponds.The fish
 ate it and became fat.He also had an  
 enclosed deer park.If anyone was      
 caught killing deer he would probably 
 be killed himself.While the Bishop had
 a good time the villagers had exactly 
 the opposite.The Palace was later     
 owned by the Earls of Essex,the       
 Orielton and Mathias families.It is   
 now a ruin and administered by {Cadw }
 for tourists.                         </content>
