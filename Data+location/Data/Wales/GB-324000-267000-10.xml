		<content> I play cricket in Presteigne (5km) and
 rugby in Ludlow (30km).My sister goes 
 dancing in Knighton.                  
 My brother plays on his bike and I    
 ride my pony.                         
 We mostly play at home with my        
 computer and ride our bikes a lot.    
 I ride my bike and go to cubs and go  
 swimming about 20 miles away.         
 I mostly ride my bike and play with my
 computer and watch tv in the winter.  
 We help our mum run her farm and ride 
 our bikes.                            
 I read my books and my little brother 
 plays with his toys.                  
                                       
 Typical comments from a class of 22   
 juniors.Most activities are centred   
 around the home with little contact   
 with other children compared with town
 children.
