		<title>08PORTHCAWL-The promenade</title>
		<content> Over the last 50yrs,Porthcawl         
 Promenade Beach has been eroded.We    
 know from old postcards that the sand 
 level was once as high as the old sea 
 wall,but due to erosion this part of  
 the coastline is known as "The Rocks" 
 The gradient of the beach and the     
 shape of the second sea wall caused   
 waves to churn up sand from the bay.  
 During high tides and storms the      
 energy of the waves carried all this  
 matter in suspension out to sea and   
 the beach disappeared.                
 In 1984 after research by Mr Marge of 
 the Polytechnic of Wales,work was     
 started to reshape the beach floor.   
 The waves now disipate their energy as
 they run up the beach and deposit sand
 rather than remove it.The Promenade   
 Beach is now returning.
