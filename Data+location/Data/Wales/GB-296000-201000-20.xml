		<content> In the graveyard there are some very  
 interesting graves.One gravestone     
 belongs to a murderer who died on     
 April 21st 1787.His name was William  
 Owen.One vault belongs to the Scale   
 family and the last Scale buried there
 was a doctor.Another brother from     
 Australia had his ashes sent over and 
 now he lies in a plot outside the     
 church.There is also some land set    
 aside for the burial of the ashes of  
 people who have been cremated.        
    We found that in the area we are   
 covering St.John's church is the most 
 interesting historical feature.
