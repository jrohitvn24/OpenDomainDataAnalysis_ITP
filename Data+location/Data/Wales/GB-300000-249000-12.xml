		<title>12BUILTH (W): EDUC,(SECONDARY)</title>
		<content>  The high school began life as Builth 
 County School in 1896.The oldest part 
 of the present school dates from 1899 
 and there is an odd mixture of        
 buildings to house the 430 pupils of  
 this 11 to 18,three-form entry mixed  
 comprehensive school.Except for the   
 original stone building of 1899,the   
 rest of the school is due to be       
 rebuilt,on its present site, at any   
 moment.Everyone waits expectantly !!!!
  Several generations of local people  
 have been educated at the high        
 school.However an increasing number of
 pupils are not from a local           
 background:a recent random sample of  
 pupils showed that up to thirty       
 percent of pupils had come in to the  
 area from elsewhere.
