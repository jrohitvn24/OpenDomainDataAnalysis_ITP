		<content>{Embryo Transplant}has been introduced 
 at {Uzmaston Farm} on two cows with a 
 high cow Genetic Index with excellent 
 conformation.    The cows are given   
 hormone injections to produce a heat  
 period at which more than one mature  
 egg is formed in the ovaries and      
 released. The cow is then inseminated 
 and as several eggs may be fertilised 
 a number of embryos will develop.     
 Recipient animals are given hormone   
 injections to bring them into the same
 stage of the oestrus cycle as the     
 donor. {Embryo transfers}are carried  
 out on the farm and the team only     
 visit on one day. Both collection and 
 egg transfer are carried out entirely{
{without surgery.}After the calves are 
 born there is a parentage check       
 through blood group typing of calves  
 (13 born so far) and dam.
