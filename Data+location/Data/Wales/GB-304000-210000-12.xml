		<content> Below the Pontsticill reservoir stand 
 the filter houses which purify the    
 water before it is piped to the towns 
 of Merthyr Tydfil, Pontypridd and even
 as far away as Caerphilly.The         
 reservoir was built in 1927 to provide
 water for the town.The valley was     
 chosen to be flooded because of its   
 suitable shape and because of the     
 heavy rainfall it received.The people 
 who lived in the villige were given   
 new land to build apon for their own  
 houses had been flooded.The dam was   
 hand built and took over a year to    
 complete.Gangs of men puddled a clay  
 core with wooden tools.Inside the     
 filter house, there were rows of big  
 tanks purifying the water, which came 
 in from the reservoir.Then air is     
 blown up from the level of sand, which
 takes all of the dirt out.Then the    
 same water became clean and drinkable.</content>
