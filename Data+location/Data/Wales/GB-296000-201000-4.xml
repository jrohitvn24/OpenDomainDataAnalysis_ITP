		<title>04Honey Farm In Cwmdare</title>
		<content> Each box produces 30lbs of honey.The  
 honeycombs are placed in a machine    
 which spins the honey out.The honey   
 can either be piped into a large tank 
 or into a milk churn.The honey is then
 taken out and put into jars.          
    The honey is either sold at the    
 farm or taken to North Wales to be    
 sold to the tourists.                 
    To prevent the bees from dying Mr. 
 Dublon has to feed his bees 2 tonnes  
 of sugar in winter.                   
                                       
    Because of this fact Mr.Dublon's   
 "bee industry" is not a very          
 profitable concern because he has to  
 spend lots of money during the six    
 cold months of the winter.            
    In Wales today there are about 1000
 amateur beekeepers.Mr.Dublon is the   
 "Principality Beekeeping Adviser for  
 Wales."                               </content>
