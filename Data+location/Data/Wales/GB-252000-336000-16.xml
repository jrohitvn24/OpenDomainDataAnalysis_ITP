		<title>16TOURISM IN MORFA BYCHAN</title>
		<content> There are about 3000 caravans on      
 various sites around the village and  
 good sites for campers.With the       
 exception of one small fun-fair,there 
 are no man-made amusements exept for  
 those provided by the largest of the  
 caravan sites,which runs a very       
 comprehensive range of entertainments.
 The area appeals mostly to those who  
 choose a self-catering holiday and who
 enjoy the beach,the countryside and   
 visits to interesting places in yhe   
 locality.Evenings can be spent relaxed
 in their own accomodation,at          
 entertainments or eating out at one of
 the increasingly varied types of cafe 
 restaurant and hotel.Several of the   
 caravan sites have shops and two have 
 swimming pools.
