		<content> Bryndraenog, now owned by Mr. &amp; Mrs C.
 Thomas, was built in the fifteenth    
 century and is the best example of a  
 timber-framed building in Wales. It   
 had a small hall and a great hall,    
 showing that the family living there  
 must have been important.It was a one-
 storey house. The oak beams in the    
 attic are still blackened by smoke    
 from the fire, which was on the floor 
 in the middle of the house.It is a    
 cruck house because it has cruck beams
 which are curved beams going from the 
 roof to the floor.In 1636 a minstrel  
 gallery was put into the great hall,  
 with stairs going up to it.The house  
 was a courthouse, where sheep-stealers
 were tried. From Bryndraenog the      
 guilty prisoners were taken to the    
 gaol at Pantycaragle, a quarter of a  
 mile away, through an underground     
 tunnel, which has not yet been found. </content>
