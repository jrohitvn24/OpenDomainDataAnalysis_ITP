		<content> There were two festivals up Twm Barlwm
 in 1984 people took records and food  
 up there.                             
    There are some famous legends in   
 this area, one of them is the Romans  
 who lived on top of Twm Barlwm and    
 killed the villigers.The second legend
 is that there was a man who tried to  
 catch a cuckoo by putting a fence     
 around it.He did not put a top on     
 it,so the cuckoo flew over the top of 
 the fence,so the people who live in   
 Risca are called CUCKOOS.             
     The people who live around Risca  
 have a distinguishing accent,and it   
 gets more distinguished as you go     
 further up the valley.                
     The people in Risca use common    
 phrases such as alright,he do do and I
 goes to him.                          
    by Paul Jones and Eifion Williams.
