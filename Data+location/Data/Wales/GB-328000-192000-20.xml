		<title>20Cwmbran's Flower Gardens</title>
		<content>  Great importance has been attached by
 Cwmbran Development Corporation to    
 landscaping and many acres of grass,  
 thousands of trees, shrubs and hedges 
 give Cwmbran a pleasant garden        
 environment.                          
  One of their major projects was to   
 turn disused clay pits at Oakfield    
 into pleasant flower gardens.         
  Most adults use the flower gardens   
 for walking around or for admiring the
 view. Children go there to meet       
 friends or to take a short cut to     
 avoid a dangerous road. About half the
 people go to study the plants and fish
 that are to be found there. Some go to
 read or have a picnic, while others   
 walk their dogs.
