		<content> HOUSING                               
 The housing of the Port Tennant area  
 is mixed. The houses on the wetern    
 edge of the study area were mainly    
 built in the last quarter of the C19th
 and the first years of C20th. The     
 houses which come into the extreme    
 east of the study area are those      
 belonging to the Gelli_Grafog council 
 estate, built to accomodate the       
 workers of the Tir John Power Station 
 which was near at hand. Street names  
 such as William Morris Gdns. and David
 Williams Tce. were given to           
 commemorate Labour PaRty slalwarts.   
 Other street names are Hoo, Crymlyn   
 and Grai. Alarge number of these      
 houses are, therefore, tenanted, but  
 here and there can be seen houses with
 individual touches uncharacteristic of
 a council estate, which shows that    
 they have been purchased.             </content>
