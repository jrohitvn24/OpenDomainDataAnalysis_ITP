		<title>15Llanfihangel to Capel Seion</title>
		<content> There is virtually no unemloyment in  
 the block, most people work in        
 Aberystwyth or the surrounding        
 experimental agricultural             
 establishments. There are many full   
 time farmersbut there are also a      
 proportion of part-time farmers who   
 have full time jobs elsewhere, ranging
 from manual to professional work. The 
 local schools &amp; pubs provide some     
 employment, mostly part-time. There   
 are a few jobs in the gravel pits near
 Capel Bangor, although people from the
 block are not employed there.         
 Transport in the area is minimal.     
 There are privately run school buses  
 from both communities to Aberystwyth  
 schools. A bus services runs along the
 main road through Capel Seion on a    
 Monday only. Llanfihangel has a public
 bus service twice a week. Car service 
 for elderly/young mother is run.      </content>
