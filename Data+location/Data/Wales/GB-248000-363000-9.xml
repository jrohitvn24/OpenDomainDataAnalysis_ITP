 On June 10th 1985 Ysgol y Gelli Class 
 4 went down  to Pool Street(Stryd     
 LLyn).We were in groups of twos and we
 had a questionnaire prepared in       
 English and Welsh.                    
 We asked the local people these       
 questions.                            
 1.Where do you live?                  
 2.Do you come into town often?        
 3.Do you like Caernarfon?             
 4.Would you change something in the   
 town?                                 
 5.Have you visited the leisure        
 centre?If so did you like it?         
 6Do you like Pool Street as it is     
 today?(It had been pedestrianist in   
 1985)                                 
 7.Do you think that there is too much 
 litter on the streets of Caernarfon?  
 8.Have you bought something in        
 Caernarfon today?                     </content>
