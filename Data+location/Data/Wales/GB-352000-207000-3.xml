		<content>{Fish}in the{River Wye}include salmon, 
 trout, dace, chubb, grayling, pike,   
 stickleback,eel and minnow.Salmon only
 come into the river to spawn and young
 eels (elvers) come in on the spring   
 tides.Stocks of salmon are depleted by
 poachers using mono-filament nets here
 and over-fishing at sea. Anglers are  
 now forbidden to use the gaff, which  
 can severely injure hen  salmon,or    
 lure fish with worms, prawns or       
 shrimps.                              
{Birdlife}includes ducks, swans, geese 
 and sea-gulls as well as dippers, tree
 creepers, wood-peckers, mergansers ,  
 goosanders and king-fishers.          
 Among the{animals}the water-bailiff   
 sees on his rounds are mink, badgers, 
 stoats, weasels, rabbits, hares, foxes
 and fallow deer. Mink have bred from  
 escapes. Deer are also slaughtered by 
 poachers.                             </content>
