		<title>13MY FAVOURITE HOBBY</title>
		<content>                                       
        My favourite hobby is          
 collecting marbles,marbles are        
 little round glass balls with         
 a bit of colour inside.I have         
 4,506 marbles.My favourite            
 marble is my Kingsy Clearsy,          
 (which is a marble a bit smaller      
 than an Emperor which is the biggest  
 marble you can get.Its as big as      
 the top of an inkwell.                
 Myself,Alistair.   I,m 10 years old   
 and I collect all kinds of soldiers   
 and army vehicles.army vehicles and   
 toy soldiers are models of warfare    
 which fight all our battles.We set    
 them up and take it in turns to       
 shoot each others men.We play a game  
 where you have a dice and a ruler.If  
 you get a six you can kill four       
 men,take a prisoner or destroy a tank 
 and so on down to one.                </content>
