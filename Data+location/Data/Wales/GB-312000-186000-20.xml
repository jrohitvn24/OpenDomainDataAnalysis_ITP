              The most popular{games   
 played by children in our school are  
 soccer, King and games played on the  
 computer.                             
           Football is played at       
 playtimes in the yard by the older    
 boys but it is popular because it can 
 be played almost anywhere and all that
 is needed is a ball.                  
           King is played with as many 
 children as you want. One person is on
 'it', and he tries to get the other   
 players on to his side by throwing the
 ball at and hitting the  other        
 players. Both boys and girls from our 
 school play this game.                
           Computer games are fast     
 becoming the most popular pastime for 
 children. Just over half the pupils in
 school now own a home computer        </content>
