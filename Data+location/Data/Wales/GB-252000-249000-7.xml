		<title>07Coming to Live in Wales.</title>
		<content>  I used to live in Bristol and we     
 wanted to move to the country . We did
 not have a nice neighbouhood so mum   
 and dad wanted a place in Wales.We saw
 a nice bungalow in Troed y Rhiw,      
 Cribyn.                               
  It is much quieter than Bristol. When
 I moved I found that there was not as 
 many children to play with and I      
 wished that I was back in Bristol.    
 Some of my friends speak Welsh and I  
 speak a little now.                   
  There are many things to do here like
 fishing, walking, bird watching.      
  The school is small but just as many 
 things go on here.                    
  In the country there are planes      
 flying over all the time and make such
 a noise that they annoy people and    
 animals.
