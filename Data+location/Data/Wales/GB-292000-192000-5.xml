		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A MINER</title>
		<content> I AM A MINER AND WORK UNDERGROUND AS  
 A FITTER.I TRAVEL TO WORK OUTSIDE THE 
 VALLEY BECAUSE THE LAST MINE IN THE   
 VALLEY WAS CLOSED IN 1983.MY SHIFT    
 BEGINS AT 6:30 AM AND LASTS FOR 7 1/4 
 HOURS.WHEN I ARRIVE AT THE PIT I GO TO
 THE PITHEAD BATHS TO CHANGE INTO MY   
 WORKING CLOTHES.FROM THERE I GO TO THE
 LAMP-ROOM TO COLLECT MY LAMP AND GIVE 
 MY"CHECK"TO SHOW I AM GOING           
 UNDERGROUND.I DESCEND THE PIT SHAFT   
 IN A CAGE,WHICH IS LOWERED ON A ROPE  
 CONNECTED TO A WINDING ENGINE.WHEN I  
 ARRIVE AT PIT BOTTOM,I TRAVEL TO THE  
 FACE BY LOCOMOTIVE AND HAVE TO WALK   
 THE LAST PART OF THE JOURNEY.AT THE   
 FACE I REPAIR COAL CUTTING MACHINES OR
 CONVEYOR BELTS.I HAVE WORKED          
 UNDERGROUND FOR 20 YEARS.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
