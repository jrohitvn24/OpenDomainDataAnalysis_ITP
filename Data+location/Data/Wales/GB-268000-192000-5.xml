		<content> were industries dealing with the      
 by-products of the smelting, i.e.     
 arsenic and sulphur. Consequently     
 arsenic works were set up in the      
 area and continued manufacture until  
 the 1st World War..                   
 During the C19th the whole of         
 Swansea's industry became devoted to  
 metallurgical manufacture, with       
 Swansea being recognised as 'the      
 copper capital of the world'.         
 The period during the warssaw the     
 decline of these industries and the   
 factories were left derelict and      
 remained to scar the area.            
 Unemployment became prevalent. In 1946
 the Aluminium Wire &amp; Cable Co. set up 
 their factories to provide much-needed
 employment in the area.
