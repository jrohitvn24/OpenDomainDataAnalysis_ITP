   FARMING CONTINUES TO BE THE MAINSTAY
 OF THE COMMUNITY BUT PROVIDES A LIVING
 FOR CONSIDERABLY FEW PEOPLE THAN IN   
 THE PAST . THE NUMBER OF FARMS RUN AS 
 SINGLE UNITS CONTINUE TO DECLINE AND  
 THERE ARE FEWER FAMILIES ENGAGED      
 IN AGRICULTURE AND LESS EMPLOYED      
 LABOUR .                              
   THE EMPHASIS IS MORE ON MIXED       
 FARMING WITH ONLY ONE DAIRY FARM WITH 
 A HERD OF APPROXIMATELY 40 MILKERS .  
 THE PRODUCTION OF BEEF CATTLE FOR     
 FATTENING OR SELLING AS STORES        
 CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF   
 THE FARMING SYSTEM WITH A NUMBER OF   
 SUCKLING HERDS . THERE HAS BEEN A     
 TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN THE SHEEP      
 POPULATION . MORE FARMERS ARE MAKING  
 SILAGE FOR WINTER FEEDING RATHER THAN 
 HAY ALTHOUGH HAY IS STILL HARVESTED BY
 MANY .                                </content>
