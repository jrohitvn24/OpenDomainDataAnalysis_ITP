		<title>17A DAY IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> A typical school day begins for me at 
 about 7.30 when I get out of bed and  
 have my breakfast of toast and        
 cereal.After that I wash and dress.My 
 twin sister and I leave for school    
 about quarter to nine, my mum usually 
 takes us in the car.I play with my    
 friends for a short while then we go  
 into school at 9.am We begin every    
 morning by reading, this is when we   
 have a chance to change our books. We 
 spend each morning working on maths   
 and English, sometimes we watch       
 interesting T.V programmes.Lunch is   
 from 12 until 1,I always stay for     
 school dinners .Afterwards I play     
 games with my friends, our afternoons 
 are spent working on Nature, Scripture
 ,Craft and Environmental Studies.The  
 school day  ends at 3.30. When I get  
 home I play skipping with my friends  
 .After a small tea I go to about 9p.m.</content>
