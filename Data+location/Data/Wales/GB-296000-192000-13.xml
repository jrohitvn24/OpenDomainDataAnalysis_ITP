		<title>13CHANGING TIMES IN CLYDACH</title>
		<content>{Mr &amp; Mrs Sam Williams - 1910          
   Clydach Vale was an expanding comm- 
 unity with many shops, banks, chemists
 and a cinema showing silent movies.Few
 women entered pubs. Social life       
 centered around chapel.Collieries     
 employed 5000 men. School was large.  
 No radio or television                
{Mr Frank Powell - 1930}               
 Roads were still muddy and cars were  
 few. Collieries were thriving. Miners 
 lived locally and bathed at home.     
 Chapel was still a dominant force.    
{Mrs Susan Owen - 1950}                
 Declining Collieries caused depopula- 
 tion. Housing conditions were poor    
 with few indoor bathrooms. Great      
 comminity spirit existed.             
{Children in School - 1985}            
 Numbers in shool now small. Shops are 
 few.Collieries have been grassed over 
 for redevelopment. Chapels are closed </content>
