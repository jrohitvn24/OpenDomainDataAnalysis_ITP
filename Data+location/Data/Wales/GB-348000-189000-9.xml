		<title>09CHILDREN'S READING.</title>
		<content>   Two of the favourite authors of the 
 children in our school are Enid Blyton
 and Roald Dahl.                       
   "The B.F.G." is a popular Dahl book 
 and the Famous Five books were popular
 with Blyton readers.                  
                                       
   Books which have been filmed for the
 cinema are popular amongst the older  
 children: "Indiana Jones and the      
 Temple of Doom" and "Ghostbusters"    
 being topical examples.  Horror and   
 adventure stories are also well-liked.
                                       
   Most of the pupils read for about   
 one hour a day at home, generally in  
 their bedroom at night.               
   The young children in our school    
 learn to read using very humourous    
 books about a king and queen who live 
 in a palace with guards, servants, and
 a very noisy baby.                    </content>
