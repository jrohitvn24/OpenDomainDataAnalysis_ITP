		<title>04A Salesman's Encounter</title>
		<content>  A salesman was driving from Swansea  
 to Carmarthen.It was a misty night and
 he was lost.A hitch-hiker was thumbing
 a lift at the roadside.The salesman   
 stopped."Get in,lad,"he said.Into his 
 car stepped a youth."Where are you    
 going?" asked the salesman.           
 "Penllergaer," was the reply.The      
 salesman asked the boy which road he  
 should take.The boy told him to drive 
 across the bridge and round a sharp   
 corner.He eventually arrived at       
 Penllegaer."Please drop me here,"said 
 the boy as they neared a church.The   
 salesman drove on to Carmarthen.Next  
 day,he mentioned the story to a local 
 man."But that is the description of a 
 boy who was killed several years ago  
 at the same spot,"said the local man. 
 "That road's been blocked off for many
 years."Is the story true? You decide.
