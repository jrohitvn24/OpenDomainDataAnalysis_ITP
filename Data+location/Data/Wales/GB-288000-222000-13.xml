		<title>13FARMING,SHEEP</title>
		<content> Because the emphasis is now upon the  
 production of fat lambs, certain asp- 
 -ects of flock management and breed-  
 ing policy arise from this considerat 
 -ion.  Thus there are no wether flocks
 on any of these farms whereas formerly
 the Cnewr Company ran several on diff-
 erent parts of the estate, purely for 
 wool production.   The choice of breed
 has been the cross between a Welsh    
 Mountain ewe and a Cheviot ram, which 
 became known as the BRECKNOCK HILL    
 CHEVIOT sheep and is now accepted as  
 a separate breed. This is a dual pur- 
 pose sheep suitable for both meat and 
 wool and preferred because they thrive
 on this kind of land and in this      
 climate. Today there is increasing    
 enthusiasm for crossing the BHC ewe   
 with a Suffolk ram because of the     
 bigger lambs which result.
