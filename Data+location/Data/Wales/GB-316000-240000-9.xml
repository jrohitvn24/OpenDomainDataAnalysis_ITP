		<content> Farmers order their barns to suit     
 their needs.The prepared materials are
 taken to the site.For erecting they   
 use a digger,ready-mix cement lorry,  
 transporter,crane and a small van.It  
 takes 2 days to fabricate and 3 days  
 to erect.                             
 The largest barn erected was 220ft.   
 long and 80ft. wide but normally,they 
 are about 60ft.x 40ft.                
 The firm works within a 60 mile radius
 and builds about 60 barns in a year.  
 They advertise by placing their name- 
 plate above each completed barn.      
 They also repair farm machinery and   
 make steel gates and doors.           
 It is interesting to note that the    
 business is run by 3 brothers on the  
 same spot as their father's forge.    
 This is the only heavy industry in    
 this area.
