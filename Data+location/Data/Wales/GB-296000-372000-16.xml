		<content> The area comes under Clwyd Health     
 Authority but no medical services are 
 situated within it.  Inhabitants      
 travel to nearby Glan Clwyd District  
 General Hospital, recently built at   
 Bodelwyddan or to the old H.M. Stanley
 Hospital at St. Asaph.  Community     
 Nurses call on patients by arrangement
 with their doctor, or through the     
 hospital.  On 20th April, 1985 a      
 Family-a-Fair was arranged at Kinmel  
 Hall by Mrs. D.H. Fetherstonhaugh of  
 Plas Kinmel to raise funds towards the
 purchse of a Body Scanner for Glan    
 Clwyd Hospital.  The target was       
 Â£10,000 and organisations from a wide 
 local area took part .  On a cold     
 windy day, hundreds of people attended
 and enjoyed the great variety of      
 events, horse rides, helicopter       
 rides,crafts, raffle and much more.   
 The amount raised was approx. Â£15,000.</content>
