		<title>12Llanhari community</title>
		<content> The community of Llanhari with an area
 of some 660 hectares,consists of      
 Llanhari village and three outlying   
 hamlets,Gwaun Llanhari,Colliers Row   
 and Tylegarw,together with a rather   
 featureless council housing estate.   
 Private housing is limited and further
 building projects are very limited    
 due to natural and man made subsidence
 caused by the mining of iron ore in   
 the locality.The surrounding area is  
 occupied by farms and buildings of    
 great antiquity. The area is situated 
 on the northen edge of the Vale of    
 Glamorgan,in the region known as the  
 Border Vale,on a low undulating       
 plateau between 75-90m above sea      
 level.
