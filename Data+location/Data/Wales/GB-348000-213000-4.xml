		<title>04 Monmouth Comprehensive</title>
		<content>  In 1977 there was a reorganisation of
secondary education in the Monmouth    
area.The Secondary Modern School with  
600 pupils was suddenly transformed    
into a mixed Comprehensive School of   
1170 pupils in 1985.Half of the pupils 
travel to school by bus.Some leave at  
8.00a.m. to arrive by the commencement 
of school at 9.15a.m..School ends at   
3.45p.m..                              
  Pupils wear school uniform and are   
urged to respect the school and all    
individuals.Reflecting the demands of  
the new computer/electronic age,the    
curriculum faces many changes.Even the 
First Years are introduced to the new  
Information Technology.In the Third    
Year pupils opt for external           
examination courses.New pre-vocational 
courses include Auto-Engineering,The   
World of Business,Consumer Services,   
Leisure Studies and many others.       </content>
