 their candidate.{                     
{                                      
{First we had to nominate some         
{people.When we had a nomination that  
{person had to be seconded.If he or she
{had a seconder they would be one of   
{the people that we could vote for.    
{                                      
{We had four nominations.We then had to
{vote for the one who was to be our

 similar way in choosing their         
 candidates.
