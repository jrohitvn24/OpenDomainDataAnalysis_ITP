		<title>04HOUSING IN ABERDYFI</title>
		<content>    The present village comprises      
 mainly of Edwardian and Victorian     
 terraced houses.Outwardly they retain 
 their original character but with the 
 resident population declining from    
 1358 in 1901 to approximately 800 in  
 1985 many have been converted into    
 holiday homes.                        
    Recent building has been confined  
 to the small scale development of     
 holiday properties set in the steep   
 hillside behind the village.          
    Aberdyfi survives as a holiday     
 resort with a booming property market.
    An elderly resident suggested that 
 for the village to continue to 'live' 
 as a community then realistically     
 priced housing for the indiginous     
 population had to be made available.
