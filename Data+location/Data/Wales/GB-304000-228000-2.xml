		<content>{Day in the life of Michael Williams.  
      My name is Michael Williams. I am
 13  years old. I live at  Slwch  Farm 
 which is 1.5 miles out of Brecon.It is
 a farm which consists  of 250 acres.  
 We  have 500 sheep, 15  cows and 100  
 store cattle  which we buy and fatten.
 Our farm house has 7 bedrooms, 2 big  
  sheds and  some old  buildings  for  
 cattle  and sheep.  The busiest time  
 of the year is lambing.  This is what 
 a  normal  day  in spring  is like.   
    First I get up and check for any   
 new born lambs. If so I pen them off  
 separately. My next job is feeding the
 cattle. When that is finished I have  
 breakfast. I then go to help my dad   
  feed  the sheep  with  cake. Other   
 jobs include moving ewes and lambs and
 pitching. At about 11 o'clock at night
 I go and see if any lambs have come.
