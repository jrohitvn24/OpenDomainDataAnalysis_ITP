		<title>02 Osbaston-Where I live</title>
		<content>  Osbaston is one of the main          
residential areas of Monmouth.I like   
living there as most of the houses have
a magnificent western view over the    
Monnow Valley.                         
  The houses are well looked after,and 
each house contributes a little to make
Osbaston look so beautiful.It is a     
quiet district with few cars travelling
through the area.The houses tend to be 
expensive with prices often exceeding  
50,000 pounds.                         
  Living in Osbaston does have some    
disadvantages.The roads are very narrow
and are often being repaired,there are 
also a lot of very sharp corners.It    
must be particularly difficult for the 
elderly,as it is so hilly.There are no 
buses to the town centre,which is about
a mile away,so you need private        
transport.There is no nearby shop,which
is inconvenient.                       </content>
