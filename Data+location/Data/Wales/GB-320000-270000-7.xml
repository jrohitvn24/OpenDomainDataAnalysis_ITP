		<content>  The single shop and the nearby Post  
 Office occupy a central position in   
 the village;not only geographicaly but
 also in the daily life of the         
 community.The shop, run by it's owner,
 sells a wide variety of groceries and 
 small household goods as well as      
 providing bread to order three times a
 week.Some greengrocery and fruit is   
 availible, besides a range of tobacco 
 products and caifectionary.Daily      
 papers are sold to order.It is, in    
 it's own way a forerunner of the      
 supermarket especially during bad     
 winters when isolation makes it then  
 sole supplier of neccessities for a   
 wide area, reaching well outside the  
 survey area.It also acts as a         
 noticeboard for local events.The Post 
 Office provides stamps, postal orders 
 and pays pensions and allowances.The  
 pub, The Greyhound, sells petrol.     </content>
