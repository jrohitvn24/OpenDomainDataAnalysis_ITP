		<content>{"OLD" NEW YEAR IN LLANDYSUL.}         
 This custom is unique to Llandysul    
 Church and dates from 1752 when the   
 introduction of the Gregorian Calander
 "lost" days. The Old New Year's Day   
 was celebrated on January 12th when a 
 breakfast feast was given by the local
 farmers for the people who had helped 
 during the harvest. Then a game{      
{"cnapan"(Black Ball)}was played. The  
 people of{Llandysul}parish played     
 against{Llanwennog}parish, and the    
 goals were doors of churches at least 
 7 miles apart. It was unruly,involved 
 any amount of players and lasted      
 hours. A more formal celebration      
 replaced this in 1833. Now the day    
 starts with morning service attended  
 by members of 11 neighbouring Sunday  
 Schools. Each group recites from the  
 Bible, sings and is catechized. The   
 event is popular and well attended.   </content>
