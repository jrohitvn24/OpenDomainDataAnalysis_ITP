		<content> The most influential family in        
 Creigiau was the Mathew family who    
 lived at Castell-y-Mynach farm. They  
 were men of importance in state and   
 municipal affairs. During the Civil   
 War, Charles I, was known to have     
 found shelter at Castell-y-Mynach     
 farm. A favourite motto at            
 Castell-y-Mynach was "Heb Dduw heb    
 ddim." One of the Mathews was commonly
 known as "Matho Dew." He was rather a 
 terror in the neighbourhood because he
 took anything he fancied from any of  
 the local farmers. Other local        
 characters in the area have been Miss.
 Elizabeth Jenkins and her brother     
 Joshua. They ran the village shop,    
 Post Office and the Telegraph         
 Exchange. John Willie Evans, the      
 village headmaster ran a school in the
 village hall (later Bwlchgwyn), from  
 1927 to 1952.                         </content>
