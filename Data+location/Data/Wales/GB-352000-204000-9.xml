		<title>09Modern Industry, Wye Valley.</title>
		<content>    The water-powered mills of the past
 no longer operate in the area and this
 heralded the end of the wire-making   
 and paper mill.                       
    Farming has always been an         
 important industry here. The          
 undulating nature of the land makes it
 unsuitable for crop growing, so       
 farming has mainly involved raising   
 dairy cows, pigs and sheep. Modern    
 machinery has helped to make farms    
 more efficient and fewer people are   
 employed there.                       
    Tourism has become an important    
 industry because of the beautiful     
 countryside and places of interest    
 which attract many people. Hotels,    
 inns and restaurants cater for the    
 needs of the tourists, bringing       
 employment to local people. There are 
 many leisure activities in the Wye    
 Valley such as fishing, and walking.  </content>
