		<title>03MORRIS CASTLE, SWANSEA (2)</title>
		<content>   The last inhabitant is known to have
 vacated the premises in 1865. Water,  
 so essential for family life, had to  
 be carried from streams and springs at
 lower levels. This difficult task led 
 to the gradual vacation of the        
 premises. Stone used for Morris Castle
 was taken to build nearby cottages.   
 Later, quarrying of underlying        
 sandstone caused the collapse of the  
 south-east and west towers. The end   
 walls of the north-east and west      
 towers still stand.                   
   On each floor, a fireplace with its 
 flue is to be seen. Also, there are a 
 number of window openings edged in    
 original brickwork.                   
   Apart from being a building of      
 historical interest, the elevated     
 position of Morris Castle gives a     
 breathtaking view of the surrounding  
 area.                                 </content>
