		<content> The area lies immediately to the east 
 of the urban-industrial complex of    
 Port Talbot and comprises part of the 
 upland plateau of the South Wales     
 coalfield.  Poor soils and rough grass
 -land favoured upland farming, but    
 today much of the area is covered by  
 conifer plantations owned by the      
 Forestry Commission.  Sheep graze the 
 remaining grassland.  Mynydd Margam is
 probably the site of the greatest     
 number of prehistoric relics in the   
 County of West Glamorgan.             
 In the south, Margam Country Park a   
 major tourist attraction, lies astride
 the southern escarpment of the coal-  
 field and is separated from the sea by
 a narrow coastal plain which is the   
 main routeway for road and rail comm- 
 unications in South Wales. Extensive  
 drilling and seismic surveys continue 
 for the proposed Margam drift mine.   </content>
