		<title>18MY SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30 and after washing and
 dressing I have breakfast then I get  
 some dinner money off my mum and catch
 the bus for school.  I do not have to 
 pay the bus fare because the school is
 over 3 miles from my house, so I have 
 a bus pass.  When we get to school we 
 have Registration then lessons.  At   
 break I sometimes buy a packet of     
 crisps for 12p.  In science we are    
 doing Plant Reproduction, which I do  
 not like.  I usually buy chips for    
 dinner from the Chip Shop and a Vimto 
 drink.  In the afternoon we have      
 music, religious education and        
 humanities.  {(Education)}            
 After school I change out of my school
 uniform into my play things.  I call  
 for my friend and we do stunts on our 
 BMX's or we go into the woods on them.
 After tea we play cricket with some   
 other friends then I watch television.</content>
