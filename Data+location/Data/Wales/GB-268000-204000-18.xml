		<title>18SHOULD WE CHANGE RHYD Y FRO.</title>
		<content> We asked people of our village if they
 would like to have Rhyd y fro changed 
 in any way. Almost everyone agreed    
 that they would not like to change the
 village atmosphere. Most people liked 
 the communitiy spirit and the rural   
 surroundings and were against any     
 further building in the area.         
     The majority of the people thought
 they would like better amenities but  
 without changing the appearance of    
 Rhyd y fro. The main request was for a
 decent park for the younger children  
 of the village. There was a very good 
 park at one end of Rhyd y fro but in  
 the past few years it has fallen into 
 disrepair. Suggestions were made that 
 this should be repaired and another   
 park built at the opposite end of the 
 village. Other suggestions were for a 
 youth club and an old people's centre.
