		<content> Radyr is now a huge, sprawling suburb 
 of Cardiff. Efail Isaf is only a few  
 miles North of Cardiff and there is a 
 fear that this will be the first of   
 many such developments in the village.
 Apart from this, the residents point  
 out that the very reason that they    
 choose to live in the village was     
 because it was small, quiet, secure   
 and isolated.                         
 They travel to work and they travel to
 the shops. They like the idea of their
 children attending small local schools
 and the more personal education this  
 brings.                               
 They like the idea of their children  
 being able to play in the country and 
 not have to walk city streets.        
 This is the way they have chosen to   
 live and they are fighting the efforts
 of developers to impose a new way of  
 life upon them.                       </content>
