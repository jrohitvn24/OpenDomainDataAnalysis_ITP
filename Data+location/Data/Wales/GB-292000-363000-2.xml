		<content>   The village is situated in a        
 mountain basin formed by the River    
 Aled between the rolling hills of     
 Hiraethog and the coastal resort of   
 Colwyn Bay.Its unpretentious church   
 was dedicated to St.Sannan,a sixth    
 century celtic saint.Two of the three 
 local chapels commemorate the famous  
 brothers Gwilym Hiraethog,a Welsh     
 preacher,poet and man of letters,born 
 in 1802,and Henry Rees,preacher,born  
 in 1798.The bronze figure of a little 
 Welsh maiden wearing a garland of     
 immortelles located in the centre of  
 the village was designed as a memorial
 to all the distinguished sons of the  
 parish.They are represented on the    
 statue by the above brothers,by       
 William Salesbury,first translator of 
 the New Testament into Welsh,by Tudur 
 Aled,poet and by Iorwerth Glan Aled.
