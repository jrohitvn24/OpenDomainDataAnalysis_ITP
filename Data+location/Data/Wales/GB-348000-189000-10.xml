		<title>10CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND GAMES.</title>
		<content>   We play in the school playground    
 three times during the school day: 20 
 minutes at mid-morning, 20 minutes    
 after lunch, and 20 minutes in        
 mid-afternoon.                        
                                       
   One of the games we play is called  
 Spud. Somebody throws a ball and calls
 a name. The person named must catch   
 the ball while the others run away.   
 THe catcher is allowed four steps,    
 then he must throw the ball: whoever  
 the ball hits is 'on it' next.        
                                       
   Another game we play is called      
 British Bulldog.  It is a rough game  
 which starts with one person in the   
 middle of the yard and all the others 
 at one side.   As they run from side  
 to side, those who are caught by the  
 middle boy have to help him catch the 
 others.                               </content>
