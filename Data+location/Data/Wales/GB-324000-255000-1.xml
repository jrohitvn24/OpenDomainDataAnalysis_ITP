		<title>01Lower Hergest area</title>
		<content> The area is dominated by Hergest Ridge
 an elongated hill topped by an        
 uncultivated moorland, covered with   
 bracken and gorse, with long green    
 rides and supporting a few sheep.     
 Offas dyke path follows the length of 
 the ridge but the dyke itself seems   
 now to be only ocasionaly discernable/
 The lower slopes of the hill are      
 mainly enclosed fields of rough       
 grazing, supporting sheep, apart  from
 the Northern slopes of the hill, and  
 Worsell Wood Hill, which have been    
 planted with conifers . There are     
 isolated farms. Lower Hergest is th   
 only centre of population in the area,
 and consists of about 10 small        
 dwellings, irregularly sited along a  
 narrow land, and whose only facilities
 appear to be a post box and an isoated
 telephone box sited well outside      
 hamlet                                </content>
