		<content> A typical day in the life of one of   
 the children within our school and    
 area, would probably run as follows:- 
      After having breakfast,          
 consisting of a cereal and perhaps    
 some toast we would walk to school.   
 Arriving in time for the start at 8.55
 am.During the morning there are three 
 lessons of about 1 hour each and a 15 
 minute break. School stops at 12.15pm 
 for lunch. The afternoon session      
 starting at 1.25 consists of 2 lessons
 and 5 minute break completing the     
 school day at 3.25pm.                 
      During the lunch hour there are  
 normally some activities and clubs for
 interested parties.                   
      The evening would be spent with  
 the home work accumulated during the  
 day and then relaxing with friends or 
 family.                               
                                       </content>
