		<content>  Living as we are in a small rural    
 village between the sea shore and the 
 mountains we are lucky because there  
 are so many varieties of birds living 
 here.                                 
  Many species are in danger because of
 man's greed and lack of respect for   
 nature.Oil is the latest threat in    
 this area.During the last two weeks   
 local members of the Young            
 Ornithologist Club have collected over
 30 dead birds along Harlech beach.Many
 more have been affected by the oil    
 spillage.                             
   Inland, birds too are affected by   
 man's progress.Farmers who spray      
 chemicals and use various poisons do  
 interfere with the food chain.This    
 results in some of the birds of prey  
 especially, becoming rarer.           
   Tackle left by anglers on river and 
 lakesides affect the swans and geese. </content>
