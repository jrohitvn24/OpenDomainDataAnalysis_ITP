		<content> One keeper told us "There are too many
 cranks interfering with nature." He   
 fears that as gamekeepers become a    
 thing of the past, woodland songbirds 
 will become extinct as there will be  
 no one to act effectively against     
 vermin such as crows,jays,magpies,    
 foxes &amp; squirrels.                    
                On 1 estate{ponds}have 
 been formed out of gravel areas which 
 have been dredged and allowed to flood
 in an attempt to make a{wetland       
{conservation area. Conifers and       
{hardwoods}have been planted around    
 these ponds which now support a       
 variety of{wild duck &amp; heron}.On      
 another estate, a{country lane}is left
 completely untouched in an attempt to 
 encourage wild flowers + hedgerow     
 life. On the same estate, 2 woodland  
 areas are left in their natural state 
 for{conservation.                     </content>
