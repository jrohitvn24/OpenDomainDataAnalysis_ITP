		<title>07Gravel Pit near Capel Bangor</title>
		<content> The gravel pits are situated in the   
 Rheidol Valley and owned by A Jones   
 Plant Ltd. The owner lives 5 miles    
 away in Clarach, his mother &amp; father  
 live on the premises. The main work   
 they carry out at the pits is         
 excavating gravel, dredging &amp;         
 quarrying. After 12 years of work, the
 ponds cover about 10 acres. Mr Jones  
 employs 5 men who all live locally.   
 Within a few years all the work will  
 be finalised, the future plans are for
 tourism, farm fishing &amp; to attract    
 wildlife which already sports wild    
 geese &amp; ducks, swans and the famous   
 Red Kite which is often seen          
 gracefully gliding above. The gravel  
 pits are part of a haulage/           
 agricultural contractors &amp; civil      
 engineering business run from Clarach.
 This gives a lot of needed employment 
 to the area.                          </content>
