		<title>04Local History Soho Farm</title>
		<content> Soho Farm was originally a summer     
 Mansion,built by Mrs.Tate (Tate and   
 Lyle sugar)and is at least 250 years  
 old.It became known as Soho Farm in   
 1900.Near the Farm house on the B4309 
 road there are the remains of a Toll  
 house.Many years ago people had to pay
 to go through this gate.By 1838 the   
 people were so fed up that a group of 
 men dressed up as women,so as not to  
 be identified,smashed all the gates   
 and Toll houses.These men were called 
 the Rebecca Rioters.Today the Farm has
 197 acres.-25 acres of vegetables,30  
 acres of grain and 142 acres of hay   
 and mixed forests.There are the       
 remains of a Roman Fort in one of     
 these forests.A Roman Battle also took
 place on land belonging to Soho Farm- 
 which forms part of the 'Stradey      
 Estate'.
