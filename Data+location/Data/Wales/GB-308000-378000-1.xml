		<content>       There has not been any private  
 development in the village for the    
 past five years,since the completion  
 of a small estate of bungalows.       
 However, the Council have built       
 sheltered accommodation for the       
 elderly in the centre of the village. 
 There is planning for an estate of    
 about 35 houses to be erected on the  
 village outskirts.                    
 There is still evidence of many       
 houses built in the 19th century.     
 Approximately half of the homes in the
 village are Council owned, though     
 there is evidence that many of these  
 have been purchased from the Council  
 by the occupants.The close knit       
 community reflects the mature age     
 of many of the residents,             
 who live in compact type homes rather 
 any modern luxurious residences.
