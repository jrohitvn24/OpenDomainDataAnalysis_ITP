		<title>08Games Llanelli Children Play</title>
		<content> Children enjoy playing games,and      
 Llanelli children are no exception    
 to this statement.                    
  One game we play is "Knocker         
 Knocker".In this game you knock on a  
 door and run away as fast as you can  
 and hide,then the man or his wife come
 out.Later you try it again at another 
 house,but never at a house where there
 are old people.Another of our games is
 Touch.This involves a lot of running  
 and it makes me tired and thirsty.We  
 enjoy skipping on our own and French  
 Skipping with our friends.Marbles are 
 very popular in school at the         
 moment,but my favourite game is called
 "May I."We take turns to say "May I"  
 and take a giant step forwards.If you 
 forget to say the words you must wait 
 until your turn comes again.The first 
 one to reach the wall or line is the  
 winner.                               </content>
