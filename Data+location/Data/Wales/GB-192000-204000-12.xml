		<title>12HAZELBANK BRIDLEPATH</title>
		<content>    The argument over the{right of way 
 from Hazelbank to Waterston began     
 early in 1984. This path is one of the
 few remaining public{bridlepaths.}The 
 owner of the land erected a kissing-  
 gate and a barbed wire fence. He      
 claimed that horses had been jumping  
 there, but this was denied and the    
 users of the path removed any         
 obstructions. Another complaint was   
 that lost horseshoes may damage farm  
 machinery - this would not occur if   
 the farmer had left the hedge which   
 formed a lane beside the field; he had
 cut it down to increase his acreage.  
    Several public meetings later and  
 after the intervention of the Horse   
 Society the farmer{re-opened}the      
 bridlepath 8 months after its closure.
 The farmer still plants crops across  
 the path.
