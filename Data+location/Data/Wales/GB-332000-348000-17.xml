		<content> IN MY SPARE TIME I WATCH TELEVISION   
 AND PLAY GAMES. I ALSO GO JOGGING,PLAY
 WITH MY BALL,PLAY TENNIS AND HELP MY  
 MUM WITH THE HOUSEWORK. SOMETIMES I   
 HELP MY DAD TO CLEAN THE CAR OR THE   
 CARAVAN IN THE BACK GARDEN. I GO      
 SWIMMING  AND ALSO PLAY WITH MY       
 FRIENDS. MY MUM DOES HER KNITTING IN  
 HER SPARE TIME,SITS IN THE            
 GARDEN,READS OR GOES TO VISIT HER     
 FAMILY. MY DAD DOES NOT HAVE MUCH     
 SPARE TIME BECAUSE OF HIS WORK. HE    
 EITHER GOES TO THE PUB IN THE EVENING 
 OR MAKES THINGS AT HOME.
