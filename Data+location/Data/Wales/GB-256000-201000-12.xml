		<content> The arrival of the car demanded the   
 roads to be improved. Tar was spread  
 over the surface and chippings        
 scattered over it. It was no longer   
 possible to make rings for marbles nor
 squares for hop scotch. The loose     
 chippings even made skipping more of a
 task than a pleasure.                 
                                       
 Children looked forward to summer time
 when days were long and the weather   
 always fine. Hours were spent away    
 from home bathing in the river and    
 cooking trout on the log fire.        
 Sometimes the children would go to    
 farms to help on the hay as there were
 always free rides on the empty        
 "gambo" on its way back to the field, 
 and in the night a free supper for    
 minding the horses whilst the "gambos"
 were being loaded.
