		<content> Chapels and Churches                  
 In our block there are three chapels  
 and one church.The name of the chapels
 are Bethel,Nazareth and Tabernacl and 
 the church is called St David's.      
    {Bethel}(Congregational) is the    
 largest chapel as regards size and    
 number of members.{Bethel}was first   
 built at 1803 but it has been         
 enlargned and altered many times since
 then.There is a small vestry at the   
 back and a graveyard at the front.At  
 present there are 172 members and no  
 Minister.                             
   {Nazareth}(Methodist) was first     
 built at 1868.In 1905, columns were   
 added to the front of the chapel,but  
 in 1954 they had to be demolished     
 because they were unsafe.The organ is 
 in a loft high above the pulpit,but   
 unlike Bethel and Tabernacl there is  
 no gallery.There are 57 members here. </content>
