		<content>     {Oakland House}is a home for      
 mentally handicapped children.        
      At the home they look after a    
 total of fifteen children. The age of 
 these residential children is from 12 
 to 19 years. However,some children    
 come just for weekend care and their  
 age is from four years on. The parents
 of the children who are residents     
 visit in the evenings or at weekends. 
      Most of the children go to day   
 centres where they do things such as  
 cooking, painting and pottery and     
 where the girls can learn about       
 make-up.                              
     The children have music, toys,    
 games and television. They also have a
 trapoline but only certain children   
 use it because of the danger.         
     The residential children have     
 their own rooms,the other children    
 share.                                </content>
