 Q.What equipment was there in schools?
      In our school we had 2 cricket   
 balls,and 1 rugby ball.               
 Q.what was the highlight of 1945 for  
 you?                                  
      The highlight of 1945 for me was 
 bonfire night,because we hadn't had   
 one all through the war because of air
 raids.We made them of all bracken     
 ,because we had no fireworks,paper or 
 tyres.another important highlight of  
 1945 was the soldiers returning from  
 the war especially prisoners of war.A 
 lot of Poles and Hungarians came to   
 this country after the war to work in 
 the mines.I can always remember the   
 obvious language difficulty they had.
