 Every year Mr Jones receives a letter 
 from the Education Authorities        
 containing one thousand five hundred  
 pounds to buy everything from toilet  
 paper to exercise books, but obviously
 this does not go far enough.The school
 is not very well equipped for instance
 it does not have a micro-wave oven    
 nor a minibus but it does have a      
 BBC micro-computer.The children start 
 school at the age of three and a half 
 and leave at the age of eleven to go  
 to a senior school.All of the lessons 
 are taught in Welsh and English.Only  
 the juniors have homework.When they   
 finally go to the senior school they  
 do a special exam before they leave .
