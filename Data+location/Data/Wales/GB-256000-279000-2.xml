		<title>02A DAY IN MY LIFE:D.Steeds.</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7:15 and had breakfast   
 about an hour later.I looked at the   
 sports page in the Times which is the 
 newspaper we get and then we all piled
 into the car to go to school.It took  
 us about ten minutes to get to school 
 then my brother and father dropped us 
 off.                                  
    In school we do English,Maths,Welsh
 and games.We have dinner in school and
 at 3:30p.m. we go home. My father{    
 picks us up from school.I have a piano
 lesson at 4:30 and at about 5:10 I    
 come home and watch some television.We
 had a supper of spaghetti bolognaise  
 which was lovely.After supper my      
 brother and I went to the top of our  
 garden to play football and cricket.We
 came back to the house to watch Cover 
 Up and C.A.T.S. Eyes.After that we    
 went upstairs to bed.We had a five    
 minute read and then went to sleep.   </content>
