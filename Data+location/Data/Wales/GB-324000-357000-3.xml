		<title>03Vandalism _ Leeswood area</title>
		<content>  Vandalism is not a serious problem   
 in this area.The damage is mainly     
 caused by a minority of youths of     
 the community.                        
  During the evenings the youths       
 congregate in the bus shelters and    
 sometimes are guilty of scrawling and 
 spraying graffiti in both Welsh and   
 English.                              
  There are youth clubs in Leeswood    
 and Treuddyn but they are open only   
 two nights a week.The youths complain 
 of boredom and a lack of facilities.  
  Our local constable would like to    
 stamp out vandalism.Maintaining Law   
 and Order in this area is relatively  
 easy.
