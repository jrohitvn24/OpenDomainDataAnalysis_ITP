		<title>11TREFNANT JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Today we went to the Junior School in 
 Trefnant. It is a small school with   
 about 50 children with 5 teachers. It 
 was totally different to a Secondary  
 School. The children were very noisy  
 and excited at seeing me, Joanne,     
 Michelle and Jenny with the video     
 camera.                               
 We interviewed Rachel Closparry who   
 has only been living here since last  
 October. She said that she was just   
 finishing her first years teaching at 
 this school although she has been     
 teaching for about 30 years.          
 She enjoys teaching very much and she 
 says that the children are very       
 willing to learn and that they are    
 very good in their work.              
 We asked her if they spoke Welsh at   
 all at home , she said mostly English 
 but some of them do speak Welsh.
