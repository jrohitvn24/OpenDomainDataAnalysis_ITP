		<content> The Offa's Dyke long distance path    
 passes 1km to the east of the area    
 bringing a large number of walkers to 
 the area but they tend to be passing  
 through and, apart from a few bed and 
 breakfast establishments, the area    
 does not benefit. Outside the area are
 a few camping and caravan sites which 
 introduce a few walkers to this block.
 The roads carry a lot of through      
 tourist traffic going from the        
 Midlands to the coast but they stop   
 only for picnics or at local towns for
 brief refreshment rather than         
 shopping. Many cyclists pass through  
 the area (as many as sixteen tourers  
 in a day on occasion) but again do not
 stop.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
