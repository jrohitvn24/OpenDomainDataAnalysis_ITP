		<title>02         FARMING</title>
		<content> A typical farm in the Beguildy area is
 Black House Farm which is owned by Mr.
 Gilbert Reynolds. It is a farm of 350 
 acres, 12 acres are used to grow      
 barley,100 acres for hay and silage   
 and the rest is for grazing. Like many
 other farmers in the area, Mr Reynolds
 is using more and more fields for the 
 production of silage because this does
 not depend as much on the weather as  
 hay production. The farm specialises  
 in rearing store cattle and sheep. At 
 present it is also experimenting in   
 the breeding of barley bulls. These   
 are Friesian bulls reared inside and  
 fed on barley and proteins to produce 
 white beef. Farmers in this area are  
 making increasing use of two and three
 wheeled motorcycles for inspecting and
 moving stock in distant fields. Some  
 farmers use CB radio for contact with 
 the farm when working on distant hills</content>
