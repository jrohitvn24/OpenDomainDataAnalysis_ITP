		<title>14THE MUSEUM</title>
		<content>   The museum was built in 1911.It was 
 first a library until some men dug up 
 Castle-collen.The men found some Roman
 things that they used to fight with.  
 When the men came back with the       
 artifacts the librarians got together 
 and had a little meeting.             
   After that they decided to change   
 the library into a museum.The         
 existence of the "Old boat" in the    
 River Ithon at a point north of       
 Llandrindod Wells had been known of   
 for some time,but it was not until the
 summer of 1929,when the water was     
 unusually low,that arrangements were  
 made to remove it from the water or   
 river.                                
   This was done on the 19th of August 
 1929.The most delicate thing in the   
 museum was the banner.The banner was  
 hung up to celebrate 60 years of Queen
 Victoria on the throne.               </content>
