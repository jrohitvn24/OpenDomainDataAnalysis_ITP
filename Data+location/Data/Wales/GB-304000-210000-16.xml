		<title>16THE FORESTRY AT PONTSTICILL</title>
		<content> Much of the land surrounding          
 Pontsticill reservoir is owned by the 
 Forestry Commision.The coniferous     
 trees were originally planted by the  
 Water Board to provide a shelter belt 
 around the reservoir.Conifers were    
 chosen in preference to deciduous     
 trees as they shed a fine carpet of   
 needles as opposed to a thick covering
 of broad leaves which would have found
 their                                 
 way into the reservoir and tainted the
 water.At present the Forestry         
 Commision provide facilities for      
 tourists in the form of picnic areas  
 overlooking the reservoirs and well   
 sign posted tracks along which one can
 walk and admire the scenery.The       
 Commision is constantly improving its 
    facilities and in one              
 area provides a Forest Centre with    
 visitor information and a gift shop.  </content>
