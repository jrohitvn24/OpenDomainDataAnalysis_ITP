		<title>08Pembrey Coastguards</title>
		<content> The first lookout at Pembrey was      
 completed in 1927. Pembrey Coastguard 
 station became an Auxillary station in
 1947. In 1970 the emphasis was laid on
 V.H.F. radio communications, 24 hour  
 radio watch being kept on the marine  
 distress frequencies.                 
   Today,1985,there are ten Auxillaries
 in the rescue team recruited from     
 villagers. The watch area is patrolled
 three times a week, midweek,Saturday &amp;
 Sunday, and last four hours. The      
 patrol has three special functions:   
{1. Familiarisation  2. Pollution      
{3. Public Relations.}The regular      
 Officers often say (in jest) that     
 Coastguard work is 95% boredom and 5% 
 panic! This does,however reflect quite
 accurately the difference between the 
 mundane work of watchkeeping and the  
 rush to get things organised when a   
 distress call is recieved.            </content>
