		<content> The Closing of the Old Melin School.  
 I was in the second form when we were 
 first told we would be leaving the old
 Melin school.We were going to move to 
 Hengwrt Primary School because the    
 roof over Mrs.Maddocks's room caved in
 and so the building was unsafe.The    
 County Architect spotted some Dry Rot 
 on the roof.The Education Committee   
 informed us that we would be moving to
 Hengwrt in May.When we were told this 
 all the children stayed away from     
 school for four days.Mr.Oates(the     
 headmaster)had a very hard job of     
 sorting out all the things we would   
 be bringing to Hengwrt.When we were in
 Hengwrt bulldozers moved into the old 
 Melin school site to demolish the     
 school.                               
 Our new school will hopefully be open 
 in January 1986.
