		<title>07DEFYNNOG C.P. SCHOOL'S TRIP</title>
		<content>  On Friday we had our school visit.   
 We went to Tredegar House by Newport  
 somewhere. The blacksmith in Defynnog 
 had just finished repairing some gates
 there, the papers said they had cost  
 Â£53,000. We saw them in the day. They 
 looked really fantastic. Anyway back  
 to the trip. We went by coach and by  
 the time we had got to the end of the 
 drive Sarah was eating..at three miles
 she was being sick, luckily no one was
 in the way. After that not much       
 happened really. The boys had to be   
 told to sit down every few minutes and
 the girls to stop singing. It rained  
 anyway. Sarah kept eating... and being
 sick. When we got to the place most of
 us played tag then we went to the     
 shops and bought ice creams and rock  
 and things. Then we went to the loos  
 and started for home. Oh yes the house
 was good too!!        (A Class effort)</content>
