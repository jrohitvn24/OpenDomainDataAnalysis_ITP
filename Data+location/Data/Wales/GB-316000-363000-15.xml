		<title>15Rural Transport at Cilcain</title>
		<content> Transport is an important concern in  
 rural areas. Many country lanes here  
 are steep and narrow,and may be block-
 ed by snow at times in the winter.Most
 householders consider private cars to 
 be essential, many married couples    
 having two cars for more convenient   
 access to places of work and shops.   
 A school bus service enables secondary
 school pupils to get to and from      
 school, but the local people are      
 poorly served by public transport.    
 Buses run from Pantymwyn to Mold, but 
 services are infrequent and fares high
 compared to city bus routes. Cilcain  
 does not have a public bus service,   
 but this gap has recently been filled 
 by the commencement of a private      
 minibus service to Mold. Although this
 only operates on three days a week at 
 present it is of great benefit to     
 those without cars.                   </content>
