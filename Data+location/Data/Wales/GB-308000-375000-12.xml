		<title>12TELEVISION IN WINTER</title>
		<content> Television is enjoyed mainly in the   
 Winter by the adults in the area, but 
 all year round by the children with   
 the average viewing time being l8     
 hours a week. Documentaries, wild life
 programmes and "soaps" such as Dallas,
 Dynasty and Crossroads prove to be the
 most popular viewing. Due to the lack 
 of shops in the area, newspapers,     
 magazines and comics are only bought  
 on the once or twice weekly shopping  
 trips, or when the children are       
 transported to School. It was         
 surprising to find many inhabitants   
 never purchased a newspaper, relying  
 on the T.V. for a round-up of the days
 events.
