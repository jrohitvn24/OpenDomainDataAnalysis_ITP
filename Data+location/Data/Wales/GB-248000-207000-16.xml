		<title>16The teachers' strike.</title>
		<content> The teachers' unions have been asking 
 the government for a pay rise,which   
 the government considers excessive.In 
 protest the teaching unions have been 
 taking industrial action,averaging 1  
 hour a day,since February 1985.This is
 having a detrimental effect on our    
 children's education as they are      
 advised by the schools to stay home   
 for the whole day,if they have no     
 transport.Many children are missing a 
 few days per week.                    
 The teachers also refuse to supervise 
 out of school activities,so           
 inter-school matches etc. do not take 
 place.                                
 If their demands are not met soon,the 
 teachers are threatening an all out   
 strike.
