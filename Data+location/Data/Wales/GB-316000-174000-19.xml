                    {(mother of two)   
{                                      
  I wake at 9a.m., then go downstairs  
 to make myself a cup of coffee. I open
 the mail and read the morning         
 newspaper. I make my daughter her     
 breakfast; which consists of cereal,  
 toast and tea.                        
  After this I have a bath and then get
 ready to take my daughter to Dance    
 Lessons which begin at 10a.m.         
  My husband picks us up and we do our 
 shopping. When we return home,I stack 
 the food in the pantry and the        
 freezer, and have a sandwich to eat.  
  At about 6p.m.we have Spaghetti for  
 tea. After the dishes have been       
 cleared away I sit down and watch T.V.
 until 11.30 p.m. Then I go to bed.    
                                       
                                       </content>
