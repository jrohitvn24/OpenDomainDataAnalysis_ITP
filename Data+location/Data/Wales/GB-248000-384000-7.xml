 There are lots of things for people to
 do in their spare time. In summer many
 men and boys go fishing, very few     
 girls or women do this. Boys also play
 football . Women attend activities i.e
 Merched y Wawr, W.I.                  
   We must go outside Moelfre for some 
 activities. There are sports centres  
 in Llangefni and Amlwch.              
   Girls can join the Brownies,children
 aged 10-14 can join Pathfinders.School
 has an Urdd branch. We have football  
 teams for under 12's, 14's, &amp; 16's.   
   In the Community Centre we have Keep
 Fit for ladies, Art Class, Welsh for  
 adults, W.E.A, Merched y Wawr, Flower 
 Club, Weight Training, Boxing, and    
 Youth Club, also a public library. In{
{Marianglas }there is a Y.F.C, &amp; O.A.P 
 club. In {Penrhoslligwy}there is a    
 social club.      Sion Richards..     </content>
