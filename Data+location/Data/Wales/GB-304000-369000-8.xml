		<content> Our names are Sian Hughes and Catrin  
 Jones. Today ,17th July 1985, we went 
 to consider the traffic problem in    
 Trefnant. In the middle of the village
 is a crossroads where many main roads 
 meet. We counted the number of        
 vehicles passing in a two hour period,
 and this is what we counted:          
 247 cars      44 lorries              
   3 tractors   4 motorbikes           
   2 hearse     1 caravan              
   5 ambulances                        
 The number of ambulances is high      
 because they use the roads to travel  
 to the nearby hospital in St.Asaph,   
 which is only a few miles from        
 Trefnant. We asked some of the locals 
 what they thought of living so near to
 the road, they sais that you get used 
 to the noise and the traffic and it   
 doesn't bother you at all.
