    We live in a rural area. The       
 village is called Rhydyfro. This is a 
 Welsh name.{Rhyd}means ford and {bro} 
 means valley. At one time people had  
 to cross from one side of the valley  
 to the other by a ford.               
   Rhydyfro is a small village with few
 amenities, only two shops. The nearest
 town is Pontardawe a mile away. The   
 nearest city is Swansea which is nine 
 miles away.                           
   The village is situated in a narrow 
 valley.The Upper Clydach river flows  
 through and joins the Tawe lower down.
 On the sides of the valley there is   
 woodland, heath and grazing land.     
 There is some dairy farming but most  
 farmers keep sheep.                   
   In the valley coal-mining is the    
 main industry. There is a large mine  
 at Abernant about one mile away.      </content>
