		<content> Although the area lies within the     
 Brecon Beacons National Park, there   
 is little tourist pressure upon       
 this area.   Cwm Treweren contains    
 the trunk road A 4067, which is an    
 important link between Swansea and    
 the Midlands, North Wales and Northern
 England.  However most traffic passes 
 through the area without stopping.    
 Cwm Crai is only  served by narrow    
 country lanes. There is no holiday    
 accommodation in the area.            
 The area is less attractive for walk- 
 ing than is the country further east. 
 Fforest Fach is much lower than the   
 main summits of the Brecon Beacons    
 so that there is little merit in mak- 
 ing the ascent. However it is a       
 surperbly fine viewpoint.
