		<content> Many of the daily happenings, concerns
 and interests of local people are     
 summed up in the pages of the weekly  
 'Brecon and Radnor Express'.It costs  
 20p and has changed little since being
 established in 1890. Most farms do not
 have a daily newspaper as there is not
 enough time to read it every day.Daily
 news comes in from radio, television  
 and the local 'grape-vine'. Every week
 sports news, inter-town cricket,      
 football, badminton, golf, tennis and 
 darts matches are reported and        
 commented on in the B+R. Ads for jobs,
 cars and sales, public notices and    
 entertainments take up most space.    
 Small ads for domestic appliances,    
 animals and skills are important. The 
 first page is taken up by auctioneers 
 adverts, reflecting the importance of 
 farming to the economy and life of the
 area.                                 </content>
