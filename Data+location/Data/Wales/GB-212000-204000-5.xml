		<content> Speaking to four elderly people of the
 village,born between 1900 and 1905    
 gave us an insight into what life was 
 like in Edwardian days.Although the   
 village was much smaller then everyone
 was gainfully employed,mainly due to  
 the fact that most people were        
 craftsmen with apprentices.Some were  
 carpenters,ironmongers,blacksmiths and
 leather workers.                      
 Many of the young men worked in the   
 mines at Bonvilles Court.Frank        
 Williams led pony trucks of coal from 
 the coalface to the liftshaft.The Mine
 Co.was the main employer of the day.  
 Mary Griffiths and Albert Howells were
 both born in Railway St.(now called   
 The Strand) so called because trains  
 ran along there taking miners to work.
 The gentry travelled by horse drawn   
 carriage and Mr Howells recalled      
 jumping on the back,hitching a lift.  </content>
