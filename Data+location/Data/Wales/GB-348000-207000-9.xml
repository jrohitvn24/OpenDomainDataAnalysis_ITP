		<title>09FARM FAMILY LIFE,LYDART</title>
		<content> My home life revolves around the work 
 of a mixed arable and sheep farm.     
 We are three in the family,and I cope 
 with all the housework - cleaning,    
 cooking,decorating,and looking after a
 large garden to provide all our       
 vegetables,the surplus of which I     
 freeze.                               
 During the busy seasons of lambing and
 potato harvesting I help outside      
 whenever needed. This involves careful
 planning of meals. We have breakfast  
 at 8.30 - sausages,egg,tomatoes,fried 
 potatoes and a cup of tea. Lunch at   
 1 p.m. is our main meal; supper which 
 consists of something savoury is at   
 6 p.m.                                
 Telephone calls interrupt my day as   
 much farm business is done this way. I
 have time to join in W.I. and church  
 activities,and to join the Gwent      
 ladies section of the N.F.U.          </content>
