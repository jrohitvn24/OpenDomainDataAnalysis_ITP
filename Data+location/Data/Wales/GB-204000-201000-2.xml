		<title>02HOUSING IN CAREW AREA,TENBY.</title>
		<content>  In recent years there has been much  
 growth and development of housing in  
 this area.Three housing phases have   
 been planned.One estate has been      
 completed,two are still in the        
 planning stage.There is also a{council
{estate}in the area consisting of{46   
{houses,}many now privately owned.     
  Most people in the area own their    
 house.Our survey suggests that only   
 about{19%}of{houses are rented,}of    
 these{approx.14%}are{council houses.  
  Most of the houses were built after  
 1960.There are{approx.37 bungalows,28 
{detached houses,39 semi_detached,1    
{hotel,1 guest house}and{5 farmhouses. 
  As far as future housing development 
 is concerned any nearby industrial or 
 commercial development could be       
 significant if this became a{dormitory
{area}for e.g.the{Pembroke Dock}area.
