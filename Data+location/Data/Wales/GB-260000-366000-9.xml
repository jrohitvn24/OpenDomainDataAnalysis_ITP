          _________                    
 We have a bird club at school that    
 meets every wednesday at 3.30p.m.MRS  
 Owens and MR Oliver take charge of the
 club and we go out bird spotting as   
 often as we can.There are 12 members  
 and we pay 60p to join as group       
 members of the Young Ornithologist    
 Club.We get a magazine called "BIRD   
 LIFE"from the R.S.P.B.                
                       We have erected 
 a bird table in the school garden and 
 also made a pond for them to drink and
 bathe.We make a note of any birds we  
 see and are given talks  by other     
 people who are interested in birds.We 
 have placed some nest boxes in the    
 trees surrounding our garden and we   
 hope a blue tit family will use it one
 day.
