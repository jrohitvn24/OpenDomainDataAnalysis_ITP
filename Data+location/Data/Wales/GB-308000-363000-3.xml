		<content>  Llandyrnog lies in the middle of the 
 Vale of Clwyd,on rich farmland between
 0 and 100m above sea level.           
 Most of the land is hedged although   
 there has been some clearance of      
 these in recent years.                
 The Vale is well wooded in parts,with 
 oaks,beech and sycamore commonly      
 found.Afforestation is very noticeable
 on the hills around the Vale.This is  
 softwood comprising Sitka Spruce and  
 Larch.                                
 The River Clwyd has its source in     
 Clocaenog Forest and winds its way    
 through the Vale to Rhyl.Fishing is   
 strictly controlled and trout is the  
 main type, found in the river and its 
 tributaries.                          
 Wildlife is varied and most common    
 types of animals and birds are found. 
 Many are killed on the small country  
 lanes,particulary squirrels&amp;hedgehogs.</content>
