		<content>{CRICKET}the village cricket club is an
 important organisation: a new         
 synthetic cricket pitch has been laid 
 on the newly reclaimed cricket field  
 in the village - and although players 
 have their doubts about a plastic     
 pitch they are pleased not to have to 
 travel to play 'home' matches anymore.
 The statistical side of cricket is not
 overlooked: one of the senior         
 committee men uses a home computer to 
 keep track of batting averages and    
 bowling figures.                      
 One player -Rhys Maggs- is a fast     
 bowler of sufficient ferocity to be a 
 regular player for the West Wales 11. 
 A junior section is being organised   
 for the boys and will run on similar  
 lines to the junior section of the    
 rugby club.                           
 The Cricket Club Barbeque is an annual
 event missed only by  the reckless.   </content>
