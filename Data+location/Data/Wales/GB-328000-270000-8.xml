		<content> Knighton does not have a cinema or a  
 recognised theatre.Any films or plays 
 have to be staged at the Pimary School
 Hall or the Community Centre.As the   
 acoustics are so poor at the Community
 Centre the School Hall is used more   
 often.The local entertainments group  
{Teme Spirits}produce musicals and     
 pantomimes each year.{Theatre Powys   
 who are sponsored by the South Wales  
 Arts Council produce plays for adults 
 and schools each year.The{Knighton    
{Concert Society}pay for well known    
 solo instrumentalists,trios,quartets  
 and choirs to give concerts each      
 season.Concerts by the{Knighton Town  
{Band }supported by local choirs and   
 choirs from outside the area take     
 place in the School Hall.{Discos}are  
 held often in the Community Centre to 
 raise money for local organisations
