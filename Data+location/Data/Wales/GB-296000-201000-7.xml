		<content> When we asked the same person "Could  
 you estimate how many vehicles pass   
 your home in one hour?"We were        
 surprised,he told us that 40_50       
 vehicles pass his house in one hour.  
    We asked "Have any official        
 complaints been made about the noise?"
 He said not to his knowledge but      
 complaints have been made about the   
 roads' surface roughness.             
    A traffic census of the main       
 roundabout of the by_pass showed 451  
 vehicles pass in 30 minutes.          
    This indicates that the main Gadlys
 Road is used less now than before.    
    Although this by_pass has caused a 
 lot of controversey the general       
 opinion is that it is an asset to the 
 community as a whole.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
