		<content> On Polling Day we all went into the   
 hall where people were going to       
 vote.When we were there,the           
 Chairperson introduced the three      
 candidates and their Election Agents. 
 The Election Agents introduced their  
 party representatives.                
                                       
 Each candidate made a speech of what  
 they planned to do.They had lots of   
 different ideas for Penrhiwceiber.    
                                       
 After they had spoken we had a chance 
 to vote.                              
                                       
 We had to give our names which were   
 then crossed off a list and go to a   
 booth where we had a printed ballot   
 form to vote on.                      
 A photographer from the paper took our
 photograph.
