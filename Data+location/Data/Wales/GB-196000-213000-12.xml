		<content> There is no shop so residents go on   
 foot or by car to Haverfordwest. Some 
 tradesmen deliver door to door :-milk 
 daily except Sunday (also cream, eggs,
 butter, cheese and potatoes), fish    
 Monday (haddock, plaice, cod, trout), 
 bread Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday,    
 soft drinks and mineral water Friday. 
 (Made in Haverfordwest from spring    
 water piped across the river from     
 Higgons Well). There are garden gate  
 sales e.g. honey, potatoes, in season.
      Near Haverfordwest Station are a 
 scales business, tool hire centre,    
 garage, oil distribution depot and    
 storage warehouse.     Since 1965 milk
 has been collected daily by road      
 tanker from refrigerated bulk tanks on
 the farms which hold the milk at 40   
 deg.F. It is delivered to Whitland    
 Creamery and made into dairy products.
