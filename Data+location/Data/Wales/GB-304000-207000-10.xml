 Things to do in Pantscallog village.  
 My name is Joanna and I live in Pant. 
 There are lots of things for adults to
 do.There is a golf course nearby,three
 pubs,a workingmen's club where darts, 
 snooker and bingo is played.There is a
 concert and dance hall and a women's  
 guild.                                
 For the children there are cub,brownie
 and guide troops,three playgrounds and
 a football pitch.But if we want to go 
 to a library or go rollerskating then 
 we have to go to Merthyr.This is quite
 expensive by bus.But I like living in 
 Pant because there is nice countryside
 where we can play.                    </content>
