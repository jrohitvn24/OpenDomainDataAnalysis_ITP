		<title>18WILD FLOWERS OF NANTGLYN.</title>
		<content>    The narrow hedge lined lanes show a
 varied ecology. A grass bank on a farm
 lane provided an ideal site to study  
 the local flora. The lane was not     
 affected by car fumes, and the verge  
 was not cut or treated. The bank was  
 south facing at a height of 220m. with
 a light loamy soil.                   
    The tallest and most abundant      
 plants were cow parsley and foxgloves.
 Close to the ground were typical June 
 flowering plants such as speedwell    
 with its pale blue flowers, red       
 campion, herb robert, timothy and     
 stitchwort.                           
    A rare wild flower present was {   
{climbing corydalis}with its clusters  
 of pale creamy yellow flowers. This   
 plant was previously seen in an oak   
 coppice to the north but its presence 
 in this verge was new.
