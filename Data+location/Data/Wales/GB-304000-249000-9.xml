		<title>09FOOD WE LIKE IN OUR HOUSE</title>
		<content> We like all sorts of food in our house
 and we eat some rather strange things.
 On Saturdays and Zsundays, we usually 
 have bacon and egg for breakfast.     
 Sometimes, we have foreign students to
 stay and they cook us a special recipe
 from their countries. When Spanish    
 people come,they usually cook         
 omelettes and French students mostly  
 cook pancakes.However,when the last   
 French ones came,they cooked meat     
 balls in tomato sauce which were very 
 nice.                                 
 What we eat depends very much upon    
 what we happen to be doing.If we are  
 at home all day we have a roast dinner
 but if we are very busy,it might be   
 something quick like spaghetti.The one
 thing mummy always expects us to eat  
 up is tuna fish pie. My sister eats   
 only a very little meat and is a very 
 fussy person when it comes to food.   </content>
