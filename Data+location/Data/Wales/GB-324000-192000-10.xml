		<title>10THE GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> IN SCHOOL WE PLAY MANY DIFFERENT      
 GAMES.IN THE LUNCH TIME OR PLAYTIMES  
 SOME GIRLS PLAY SKIPPING (I DON'T)    
 WHILE THE BOYS PLAY BALLTAG.THEY ONLY 
 START PLAYING THIS IN THE SUMMER      
 SEASON.OTHER DAYS THEY JUST SIT AROUND
 DOING NOTHING.IN THE WINTER THE GIRLS 
 PLAY NETBALL WITH MRS JARRETTS CLASS. 
 IN THE SUMMER ONE OF OUR LESSONS IS   
 LONGBALL OR ROUNDERS.WE PLAYED AGAINST
 MRS JARRETTS CLASS 2 OR 3 TIMES AND   
 THEY WON ALL THE TIME.(OUR CLASS ARE  
 STILL SKILL THOUGH.)BOTH GAMES ARE    
 QUITE SIMILAR EXCEPT IN ROUNDERS YOU  
 RUN ROUND AND IN LONGBALL YOU RUN UP  
 AND DOWN.AT HOME SOME FRIENDS AND     
 MYSELF PLAY DANISH LONGBALL.THE       
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND LONGBALL  
 IS THAT IN DANISH LONGBALL YOU RUN A  
 FURTHER DISTANCE.MY FAVOURITE GAME    
 IS LONGBALL,IT'S HAYLEY_JANES AS WELL.
