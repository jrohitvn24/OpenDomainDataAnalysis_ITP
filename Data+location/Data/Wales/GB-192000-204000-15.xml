		<title>15"PEMBROKESHIRE" CLIMATE</title>
		<content>    Pembrokeshire's early vegetables   
 are a clue to the local climate.      
{Spring}comes earlier here than in most
 of the UK.                            
   {May and June}are usually drier     
 months and the locals enjoy their     
 first summertime visits "down the     
 beach".                               
    This area is also one of the       
 sunniest in Wales and Tourism is an   
 important industry. The mean{July     
 temperature is only 16 C,though,      
 because of the sea's influence.       
   {Autumn}days are often cool with    
 mists over the Haven in the early     
 mornings, although there are few days 
 with fog because of the winds.        
    The{winters}are mild - 6 C, but wet
 and windy with most winds coming from 
 the open Atlantic to the south-west.
