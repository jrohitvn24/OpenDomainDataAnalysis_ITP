		<content> THE PREDOMINANT VILLAGE ACCOMODATION  
 CONSISTS OF COUNCIL HOUSING - WELL    
 BUILT BRICK HOUSES REPLACING THE SMALL
 COTTAGES WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT AROUND  
 THE OLD BLACKSMITH'S SHOP AND INN     
 WHICH SERVED THE DROVERS. MANY OF THE 
 EXISTING OLD HOUSES HAVE BEEN RESTORED
 OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING        
 RESTORED. THERE IS A MODERN, WELL-KEPT
 VILLAGE HALL. IN THE FIELDS ON THE    
 OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE SOME NEW     
 LUXURIOUS BUNGALOWS HAVE BEEN, OR ARE,
 BEING BUILT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE  
 LOVELY VIEWS DOWN THE VALLEY.         
 THE FARMS ARE ALL OLDER BUILDINGS. THE
 CHAPEL HAS RECENTLY BEEN CONVERTED TO 
 A DANCE STUDIO WHERE BALLET AND TAP   
 DANCING CLASSES ARE HELD. THE THREE   
 HORSESHOES PUBLIC HOUSE IS A FAVOURED 
 STOPPING PLACE FOR TREKKERS AND CATERS
 FOR THE BED AND BREAKFAST TRADE.
