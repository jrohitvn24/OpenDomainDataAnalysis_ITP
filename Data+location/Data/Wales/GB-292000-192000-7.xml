		<title>07A RETIRED PERSON'S DAY</title>
		<content> I RISE ABOUT 8:30 AM AND MAKE A CUP OF
 TEA.THEN I LIGHT MY COAL FIRE.AFTER MY
 BREAKFAST OF CEREAL,TOAST AND         
 MARMALADE,I CLEAN AND DUST THE        
 KITCHEN.                              
 LATER I VISIT MY NEIGHBOUR,WHO IS     
 HOUSEBOUND,TO SEE IF ANYTHING NEEDS TO
 BE DONE AND TO HAVE A FRIENDLY CHAT.  
 AFTER EATING LUNCH I POP DOWN TO THE  
 VILLAGE TO DO MY DAILY SHOPPING AND   
 CHANGE LIBRARY BOOKS FOR MY NEIGHBOUR 
 AND MYSELF.I USUALLY SPEND TIME       
 CHATTING WITH FRIENDS I MEET.I AM ON  
 SEVERAL COMMITTEES WHICH KEEPS ME     
 QUITE BUSY AND ACTIVE THROUGH THE     
 WEEK.AFTER TEA,IF I HAVE NO MEETINGS  
 I SETTLE DOWN TO WATCH T.V. AND READ. 
 BY 11:00 PM I USUALLY GO TO BED.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
