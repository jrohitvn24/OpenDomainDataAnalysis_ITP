		<content>  Pontypool is a nodal point,a junction
 of valleys,canals,roads and until     
 recently railways.                    
  The Abergavenny and Blaenafon vales  
 meet here.Consequently the Newport_   
 Pontnewynydd canal was joined to the  
 Brecon canal,the junction being at    
 Pontymoile.The canal keepers cottage  
 where tolls for navigation were taken 
 is still in existence. From here to   
 Brecon shallow draft boats cruise now 
 for pleasure.                         
  Roads from Crumlin,Blaenafon,join the
 Newport_Shrewsbury trunk road just    
 south of town.Easy access to the M50  
 to the Midlands, M4 to London and     
  M5 makes this area attractive to     
 industry.                             
  Rail communication is by the mainline
 to the North but at Pontypool there   
 were extensive marshalling yards as it
{was }a major railway junction.        </content>
