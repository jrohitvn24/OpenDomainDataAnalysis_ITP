        ******************             
{Ye Watche House-}an unusual building  
 which stands  on the Parade opposite  
 the middle slipway.It juts out into   
 the road making it very narrow.In     
 years gone by it was the Watch Tower  
{used by coastguards looking for       
{smuggling activities and shipping     
{problems}in the estuary since there   
 were no navigation lights.            
{The Boathouse Restaurant-}has been the
 site of several buildings of different
 names _Pengwern Arms,Ferry House,and  
 Boathouse Inn, but each has been      
 involved in hostelry.As most names    
 suggest,{in the past a ferry boat left
{here  for Flint and Bagillt}and along 
 with the horse-drawn coaches provided 
 transport for people of Wirral and    
 North Wales
