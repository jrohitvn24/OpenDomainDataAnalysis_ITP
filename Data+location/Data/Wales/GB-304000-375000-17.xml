		<content> There are a number of privately_owned 
 properties in the village of Rhuallt. 
 The most recent,a bungalow,having been
 completed approximately one year ago. 
 One or two private houses are used as 
 rented accomodation. One of the farms 
 on the outskirts of the village is    
 also rented,from the County.          
 The majority of the housing is council
 owned.The buildings consist of family 
 houses and bungalows for the elderly. 
 A minority of the council houses have 
 been bought by the previous tennants. 
 The older population being static and 
 no plans being envisaged to extend the
 estate,there is a drift of the young  
 from the village to other areas. This 
 reduction in the number of young      
 families has contributed to the steady
 decline in numbers at the school,whose
 long-term future would seem to be in  
 jeopardy.                             </content>
