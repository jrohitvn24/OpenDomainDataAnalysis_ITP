 Q.Did people go on holiday in 1945?   
       Yes but only to Porthcawl or    
 Barry,they used to go on a bicycle or 
 perhaps a bus. Some went on working   
 holidays to Kent potato picking,they  
 would sleep and eat in the farmhouse, 
 and get paid at the end of the week.  
                                       
 Q.What public transport was there?    
       There was hardly any privately  
 owned cars, and a few buses but       
 there was always long queues with     
 restrictions of 5 standing.           
 Q.What clothes did the children wear? 
      Clothes were very basic there    
 were no trainers or jeans,all boys    
 wore short trousers in school,boys    
 went into long trousers at the age of 
 16, but girls were never seen in      
 trousers, they wore gym slips.        </content>
