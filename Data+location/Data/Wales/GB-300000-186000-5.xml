  My best game is cabbage.The game goes
 like  this. You  have a ball and when 
 you say cabbage everyone has to stop  
 and then you throw the ball.If it hits
 someone they are on it.               
{Moving Targets                        
  The bell goes for playtime.Kevin gets
 his tennis ball and we all tramp out  
 to play.We all decide to play moving  
 targets.Whoever is on it has got to   
 hit all the other people who are      
 playing with the ball.The people who  
 are not on it have got to stay against
 a wall and are only allowed to move   
 back and fore across the wall.        
{Naughty Children                      
  The idea of this game is one person  
 is the mother and the rest are        
 children.The children run away from   
 the mother.When the mother catches a  
 child the child is on it.             </content>
