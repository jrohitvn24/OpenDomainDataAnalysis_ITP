 time,Mum reads. Fishing and shooting. 
 Mum likes gardening and going to dress
 making classes 1km away and my Dad    
 likes watching Presteigne football    
 team playing. If we have any it's     
 spent in gardening and going for walks
 and watching tv. Dad reads and does   
 crosswords and mum reads, sews and    
 likes gardening. We listen to music   
 and read and we like cycling and mum  
 likes sewing and gardening. Dad       
 supports rugby and goes to Knighton or
 Cardiff to watch it and mum plays     
 badminton and aerobics. Dad likes long
 hikes and mum likes gardening and we  
 all like bike riding locally.         
                                       
 Typical responses from parents- many  
 farmers deny having spare time- any   
 they DO have seems to be spent        
 watching tv!                          </content>
