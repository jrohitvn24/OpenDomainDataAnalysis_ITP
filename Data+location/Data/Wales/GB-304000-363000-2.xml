		<title>02Denbigh Castle c 1284-1322</title>
		<content>   Local history is dominated by this  
{Edwardian castle,}which due to its    
 strategic position, commanding view   
 and proximity to the English border,  
 enabled{Denbigh}to develop as a       
 military town. The castle and walled  
 town, both classed as{Grade 1 ancient 
{monuments,}form one of the largest    
 fortressed areas in{Wales.}It is still
 well defined with the{Burgess gate,   
{towers}and the{castle gatehouse,      
 comprising 3 octagonal towers, well   
 preserved. Inside the castle's small  
{museum and exhibition}reminds us that 
{H.M.Stanley, of Livingstone fame,}was 
 born nearby. After recent repair work 
 the castle walls were re-opened{May   
{11th 1985}by the{Mayor}and once again 
 from their heights the visitors are   
 able to enjoy the breathtaking views  
 of the{Vale of Clwyd.
