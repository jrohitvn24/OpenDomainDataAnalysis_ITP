		<content> I watch about four hours of           
 television each week from about 4.20  
 till 6 p.m. and then from 7 o'clock   
 till 10 p.m. On Saturday i watch      
 television in the morning, afternoon  
 and night. I watch more television    
 than the rest of my family. I like    
 soap opera's like "Dallas" and        
 "Crossroads" but my favourite program 
 is "Bewitched". It is about a witch   
 who does magic by twitching her nose  
 but always gets things in a muddle. My
 family like comedies and thrillers. We
 have two black and white televisions. 
 One is on a stand in the living room  
 and the other which is a portable in  
 my bedroom. I would like to see more  
 comedy and less sport.
