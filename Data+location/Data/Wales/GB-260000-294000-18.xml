		<title>18THE BELLS OF ABERDYFI</title>
		<content>    Aberdyfi's chief claim to musical  
 fame is the well known song Clychau   
 Aberdyfi{(The Bells Of Aberdyfi).     
    Composed by Charles Dibdin         
 1745-1814,the song is said to be based
 on a local legend telling of the      
 submerging of the 'Cantrir Gmaelod' or
 the 'Lowland Hundred' a rich and      
 fertile plain to the west of Aberdyfi 
 and now beneath the waters of Cardigan
 Bay.                                  
    Remains of boundaries belonging to 
 this lost land are said to correspond 
 to the submerged reefs which extend   
 into the sea just north of Towyn and  
 south of Borth.Both reefs are well    
 known to local shipping and their     
 extremities are marked by buoys.The   
 remains of tree stumps said to be from
 forests long since submerged can still
 be seen around the Dyfi estuary at    
 very low tides.                       </content>
