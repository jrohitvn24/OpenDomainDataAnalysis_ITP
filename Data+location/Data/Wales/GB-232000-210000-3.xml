		<title>03LLANYBRI VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Llanybri village stands on a hill     
 behind Llansteffan and is smaller and 
 more rural in character. In the middle
 stands the roofles shell of Hen Gapel 
 (Old Chapel). The 36 village houses   
 are nearly all over 100 years old,    
 except for a few modern bungalows.    
 There is also a council estate on the 
 edge of the village, with 12 houses   
 and 14 old people's bungalows (with   
 resident warden). Unlike Llansteffan, 
 where the farmhouses stand in the     
 midst of the holdings and are away    
 from the village, Llanybri has 4      
 farmhouses with their yards and       
 buildings on the roadside, giving it  
 an air of rural busyness absent from  
 Llansteffan.   In recent years, Local 
 Authority grants have enabled owners  
 to improve their old houses, so that  
 now virtually all have indoor         
 sanitation with baths or showers.     </content>
