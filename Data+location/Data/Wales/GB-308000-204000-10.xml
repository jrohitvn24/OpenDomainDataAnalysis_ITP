 The first school in Fochriw was in    
 the Methodist Chapel building in      
 Guest Street. Later there was a       
 school next to the building which is  
 still called School House.The present 
 Infant School was built in 1904,the   
 Junior Dept.in 1909. They were both   
 made of local stone,red brick,timber  
 and Welsh slate from the quarries of  
 North Wales.All the slate came by     
 railway.In this year of 1985 there are
 six classes in our school.Two of them 
 are in the Infants and four in the    
 Juniors.There are six teachers and one
 Headmaster teaching 144 children.In   
 1977 there were 250 children taught by
 10 teachers.In the village we also    
 have a Nursery School.The Playschool  
 is held in the Community Centre.All   
 children in the district attend       
 Rhymney Comprehensive School.         </content>
