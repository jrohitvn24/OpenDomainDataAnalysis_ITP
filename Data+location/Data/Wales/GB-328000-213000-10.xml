		<content>The Church of Wales is represented by  
two church buildings;St. Mary's Church 
in Monk Street and Holy Trinity Church 
in Baker Street.The original Church of 
St. Mary was the church of a Bene-     
dictine priory established during the  
reign of Henry I (1100 - 1135).        
Roman Catholics attend the Church of   
Our Lady and St.Michael.               
The Baptist Church on the corner of    
Pen-y-Pound and Frogmore Street reminds
us that the first Baptist Acadamy in   
Wales was established in Abergavenny.  
The Whitefield Presbyterian Church in  
Pen-y-Pound is evidence of the early   
Calvinist influence in Abergavenny.    
Also to be found in Abergavenny are a  
United Reform Church,a Methodist       
Church,a Christadelphian Church,       
a Salvation Army Citadel,an Assemblies 
of God Church and a Gospel Hall.
