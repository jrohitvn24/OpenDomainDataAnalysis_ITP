		<content> There is a small swimming bath in the 
 village which is attached to Defynnog 
 County Primary School.It was opened in
 1975.  Building of it was financed by 
 public subscription and it is a public
  bath.  However by arrangement with   
 Powys Education Committee, the bath   
 is only available to the public during
 the evening and at weekends in term   
 time.  During school hours it is used 
 by different schools in the district. 
 The bath is heated by burning wood    
 from a sawmill on the other side of   
 the road.
