		<content> When our mums and dads go shopping the
 shops they go to depend on the area   
 where we live and what they need.     
    In Llanrymney there are shops in   
 Countisbury Avenue and Ball Road.Most 
 of them sell fruits and veg,meat or   
 newspapers.At the top of Rumney hill, 
 the shops include a Bicycle shop,     
 Opticians  and a clothes shop.        
    In Llanedeyrn many people go to the
 Maelfa,a large shopping centre.Here   
 there are two supermarkets as well as 
 grocers butchers and clothes shops and
 an optician.There is a much smaller   
 shopping centre in Pentwyn.           
    Most of the time,our parents go to 
 one of the big supermarkets,that are  
 fairly near.Sainsburys have two       
 supermarkets nearby.One at Thornhill, 
 the other in Colchester Avenue.Tesco  
 in St.Mellons is also well used,and   
 they provide a bus service for users. </content>
