 The NEATH AND BRECON RAILWAY was the  
 successor to the Brecon Forest Tram-  
 road.  It was built in the 1860's and 
 commenced operation in 1867.   This   
 railway became part of the G.W.R. net-
 work in 1922 and then British Railways
 in 1948.  This branch line ceased to  
 operate in 1962.   Its route lies     
 across the slopes of Fforest Fach on  
 the western side of Cwm Treweren. In  
 places it can be seen quite clearly,  
 but, because most of the bridges have 
 been destroyed it is not possible to  
 follow the old track for any distance.
 In some places the site of the track  
 has been ploughed and it is hard to   
 imagine where the track crossed some  
 fields.
