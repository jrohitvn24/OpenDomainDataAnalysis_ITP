		<title>02EDUCATION IN MOUNTAIN ASH</title>
		<content>                                       
{There are 9 primary schools}in        
 Mountain Ash(one of which is a        
 Catholic school),all of which         
 are'feeder'schools to the one very    
 large split site secondary school     
 in the town.                          
 The primary schools are typical       
 examples of late nineteenth,early     
 twentieth century architecture to be  
 found in the South Wales valleys.They 
 generally have tall steep roofs,with  
 stone walls taken from local sandstone
 quarries.                             
 The classrooms are usually situated   
 off a main central hall. They have    
 large windows and very high celings.  
 They are therefore expensive to heat  
 in winter.Unfortunately due to lack of
 money many schools are in need of     
 urgent repair.
