 Crickhowell are{HIGH STREET}and       
{BEAUFORT STREET .                     
  Most of the shops are{non-specialist 
 general stores. There are a few banks 
 and estate agents and only one very   
 small supermarket.There are also a    
 large number of pubs, for its size.   
  Almost all the shops are small, often
 with houses between them. They offer  
{personal service}and{convenience      
 goods.{                               
{ Parking}is limited, with only        
 one car park which is some distance   
 from the main shopping centre         
 although parking is allowed on the    
 main streets.                         
  In the last 30 years, due to a change
 in shopping habits (Bulk buying,Use of
 freezers and monthly paying),people go
 out of the town to larger{supermarkets
 in{Abergavenny}and elsewhere.         </content>
