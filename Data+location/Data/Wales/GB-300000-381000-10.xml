		<title>10THE LIFEBOAT SERVICE, RHYL</title>
		<content>  The Rhyl lifeboat service started in 
 1852. The lifeboat station was        
 originally built at the Foryd harbour 
 but the boat would not go under the   
 bridge at high tide and it was        
 difficult to launch at low tide. Thus,
 in 1894 it was moved to its present   
 position halfway along the promenade. 
  The Rhyl boat covers an area from the
 Point of Ayr to Llandulas. The present
 boat, installed in 1969, was bought   
 with a Â£37,000 legacy from Miss Watt  
 in memory of her parents, Harold and  
 Lilian. Its name "Harlil" comes from  
 the first three letters of each of    
 their names. It is an Oakley          
 self-righting boat which can          
 automatically right itself in 6       
 seconds. It travels 165 miles on a    
 full tank of fuel and its speed is    
 about 8 knots. A more modern boat will
 be installed in 1989.                 </content>
