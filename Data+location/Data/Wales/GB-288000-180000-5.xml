		<title>05LOCAL HISTORY OF BRIDGEND</title>
		<content>  Bridgend is no longer a{market       
{town}as it is not in the centre of any
 farm land.The{cattle market}was       
 knocked down in 1976.{Transport}has   
 changed, with people using            
 cars,lorries and buses instead of     
 trains.Many{buildings}have been       
 knocked down to make way for new roads
 and car parks.When{shopping}fifty     
 years ago a lady would be offered a   
 chair while the shopkeeper took her   
 order.These friendly{family shops}have
 now been replaced by large            
 self-service{supermarkets.}At eleven, 
 all children go to a{comprehensive    
 school.Fifteen years ago,some went to 
 a{grammar school}and others to a      
{secondary modern school.}The old      
{buildings}in Bridgend were mostly made
 of stone, but the new modern buildings
 don't fit in that well and the town   
 has lost its character.               </content>
