		<title>11BRECON FOREST TRAMROAD</title>
		<content> When the Great Forest of Brecknock    
 was enclosed and sold off by the Crown
 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, a  
 considerable part of that land was    
 bought by J.Christie,a London indigo  
 merchant.  Amongst his developments   
 in the area was the tramroad extending
 from the upper part of the Swansea    
 valley to Castell Du near Sennybridge.
 The small trucks were pulled by horse.
 Work on this started in 1821 and the  
 tramroad operated until the 1860's,   
 although by then it had changed hands 
 several times.At that time Fforest    
 Fach had already been divided amongst 
 various owners and Christie (who for  
 some years was Lord of the Manor) had 
 to negotiate the route through Cwm    
 Treweren.  Much of the site of this   
 tramroad may still be identified where
 it lies slightly higher than the old  
 Neath and Brecon railway track.       </content>
