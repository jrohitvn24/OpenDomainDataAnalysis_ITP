		<title>16THE NEWS IS AWFUL</title>
		<content>   I live in {Porthcawl}and travel to  
 school every day. I don't watch the   
 tele much because the news is so      
 awful. We seem to live in luxury      
 compared to people in places like {   
{Ethiopia,}they are starving and       
 although we have raised millions of   
 pounds to help we don't seem to be    
 getting very far. President Reagan and
 Mr. Gorbachov have just finished their
 talks and they seem to be friendly but
 are they? They could blow the whole   
 world up if they had a nuclear war!   
   People are into drugs, smoking and  
 drinking and more nad more people have
 cancer. One good thing medical        
 technology is improving all the time  
 but without disease we would be over  
 populated and then there would be lots
 of murders. I don't know where we'll  
 end up.
