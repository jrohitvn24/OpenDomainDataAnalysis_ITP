		<title>02A Day in the Life of Jenny</title>
		<content>I woke up,washed and dressed.At 8.30 I 
played draughts with my brother and I  
beat him.It was time to walk to school.
Daddy said that after school I could go
with him to the radio station.         
When I get to school I talked to my    
friends until Mrs. Phillips marked the 
register and we went into Prayers.We   
did Maths and English.John and Robert  
did a Maths program on the computer.   
The playbell rang and we stood behind  
our chairs and went out.The nurse      
examined in the afternoon.She tested my
heart with a stethoscope.              
After school at 3.30 I went to the     
radio station and joined in with some  
of the poems Daddy was reading to the  
patients in Penyval.Later I got my     
nightie on and went to bed 7.00.A      
sensible time for a seven year old     
girl to go to bed.
