		<content> OUR AREA,WHICH IS IN WEST GLAMORGAN,IS
 IN THE UPPER PART OF THE VALE OF NEATH
 AND IS CRADLED ON TWO SIDES BY THE    
 MOUNTAINS CRAIG-Y-LLYN AND HIR-FYNYDD 
 WHICH INFLUENCE OUR WEATHER TO GIVE US
 ABOVE AVERAGE RAINFALL.OUR AREA HAS   
 BEEN SEVERELY SCARRED BY HEAVY        
 INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AND, AS A RESULT, 
 HUGE SLAG TIPS HAVE SPRUNG UP.MUCH OF 
 OUR MOUNTAIN SIDE HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER 
 BY THE FORESTRY BUT THERE IS QUITE A  
 LOT OF NATURAL WOODLAND AND FARMLAND  
 TOO.THE RIVER NEATH,WHICH ORIGINATES  
 IN THE BRECON BEACONS,MEANDERS ITS WAY
 THROUGH THE VALLEY PROVIDING ENDLESS  
 HOURS OF ENJOYMENT FOR LOCAL ANGLERS. 
 OUR AREA CONSISTS OF THREE SMALL      
 COMMUNITIES,CWMGWRACH,LAMBAND FLAG AND
 LOWER GLYNNEATH,EACH WITH ITS         
 SEPARATE LIFESTYLE AND INTERESTS..
