		<title>12A Day in the Life of a Miner</title>
		<content> It is six in the morning,time to go to
 work.I walked through the gates of the
 colliery.I had to go and get my kit   
 and then clock on and and get my lamp.
 Looking at the B 20 board,I saw my    
 name.I was going to work at a face two
 miles from the shaft.My kit consisted 
 of an orange overall,light,helmet and 
 fire damp detector.Thirteen men walked
 into the cage with me.I fixed the lamp
 to my helmet and proceeded down the   
 rough passage way.It takes one hour of
 walking to get to the face.           
 I worked underground for seven and a  
 half hours.Before leaving,I check my  
 fire damp detector.It was fine.       
 On the surface,I made my way to the   
 lamp room and then clocked off.After  
 my shower,I said a farewell to the    
 colliery and left.
