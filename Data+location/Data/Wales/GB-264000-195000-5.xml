		<title>05MORRISTON, SWANSEA</title>
		<content>   Morriston is a northern suburb of   
 Swansea, consisting mainly of housing,
 one main shopping street and, on its  
 fringe, the new Enterprise Park.      
   The housing is a mixture of houses  
 built before World War I, modern      
 houses built after World War II, and  
 Council houses.                       
   Woodfield Street is the main        
 shopping centre, with a wide variety  
 of businesses ranging from            
 supermarkets to small, individually   
 owned premises.                       
   The new Enterprise Park is being    
 developed to the east. Industrial     
 firms, supermarkets and a hotel       
 complex have all been enticed to this 
 zone, which is being developed into a 
 very attractive area.                 
   Morriston is near the M4 and within 
 easy reach of popular tourist places  
 such as Gower and the Brecon Beacons. </content>
