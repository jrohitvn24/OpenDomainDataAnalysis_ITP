 We have decided to write a few pages  
 on the School Election as we hope to  
 have it every year.                   
 Three classes were involved in forming
 a party,choosing a candidate,planning 
 the campaign and running the election.
                                       
 The idea for the election came from   
 studying how the local government     
 elections were run.We tried to copy   
 this as best we could.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
