		<content>   I get up at about quarter past eight
 and I get dressed.Then I get my bag   
 ready to go to school.I have a wash   
 and go downstairs.For breakfast I     
 usually have a bowl of frosties, a    
 piece of toast and a cup of tea.      
 If my drinks flask is left in my bag, 
 my Mum or Dad shouts at me.Sometimes I
 play with Shadow, our dog, before I go
 to school.I have got five pets al-    
 together,one dog,three cats and a     
 rabbit.                               
   My favourite television series is   
 The secret diary of Adrian Mole.It is 
 on ITV on Mondays.Sometimes I walk    
 slowly to school but sometimes my Dad 
 takes me up in the car because it's   
 been raining and the field is wet.On  
 Saturdays we go to town.The stores    
 we go to most are Kwik save,Co op and 
 Tescos.My favourite hobby is fishing. 
 I have got three rods and four reels. </content>
