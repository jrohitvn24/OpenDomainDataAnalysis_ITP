		<title>15FARMING</title>
		<content> Over half of our area is rural but    
 this does not include any large farms.
 The farms in our area are small       
 hill_farms. These are predominantly   
 sheep farms that utilise the rough    
 grazing of the mountainside. The only 
 crops grown  are hay for winter       
 feeding and one small area of kale for
 animal feed.                          
                                       
 The other main farming activity is    
 that of forestry (tree farming). This 
 is done by the Forestry Commission.   
 The trees are predominantly Norway    
 or Sitka Spruce. They are usually     
 harvested after a period of thirty    
 years. The timber is used for pit     
 props, fencing and furniture.         
                                       
 Many of the hill_farms have now become
 derelict and much of the mountainside 
 is now being afforested.              </content>
