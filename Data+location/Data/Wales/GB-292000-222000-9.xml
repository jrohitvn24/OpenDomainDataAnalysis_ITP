		<content> Although the annual wool clip provides
 a source of some income, this is only 
 secondary to the income derived from  
 the sale of fat lambs.  Consequently  
 the selection of sheep breeds and     
 management of flocks is geared to meat
 rather than wool production.          
 The native breed of these uplands is  
 the WELSH MOUNTAIN SHEEP, but in this 
 area it has been modified by crossing 
 with Cheviot rams to produce the      
 BRECKNOCK HILL CHEVIOT, now recognised
 to be a separate breed.  Further cross
 -ing with lowland breeds,notably the  
 SUFFOLK, has greatly improved the size
 and weight of the lambs.              
 Each farm has its resident flock of   
 breeding ewes to which is added each  
 years crop of ewe lambs.The ram lambs 
 are sold for slaughter at about 6     
 months old.  No wethers are kept as   
 would be the case for wool.           </content>
