		<title>15MY FARM IN MOELFRE</title>
		<content>                                       
 I live on a farm of 130 acres in      
 Moelfre.My father keeps 50 Friesian   
 cows for milking. We deliver milk to  
 the houses, shops and restaurants in  
 the village.                          
       We have 70 sheep and 100 lambs  
 and two rams. I have 20 chickens of my
 own and I sell the eggs to local      
 people.                               
       At this time of year my father  
 is busy cutting silage to feed the    
 cows in the winter. He also makes hay 
 later on, and I like to help him.     
 There is always plenty of work to do  
 on the farm.                          
       We have a caravan site on the   
 farm which my mother looks after.
