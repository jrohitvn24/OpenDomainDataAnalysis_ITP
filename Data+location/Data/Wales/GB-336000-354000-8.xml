		<content> There is a playground opposite the    
 Rofft School.It has : A slide for     
 young children and a bigger one for   
 older children.Small and big swings,  
 climbing frames,tubes,logs,a rocking  
 ship and foot-ball goal-posts.There is
 also a large grass area for picnics,  
 etc.People go there for enjoyment and 
 most children have good times there   
 and there are hardly any accidents.I  
 think that the playground has made    
 good use of that land.                
 The Rofft School holds Brownies on    
 Wednesdays and Thursdays.Brownies are 
 for the 7-10 year olds and they go on 
 short walks,play games and lots       
 more.The girls enjoy themselves here. 
 For fifteen pence an hour they have   
 good fun.                             
 Guides(10-14) are held on Wednesdays  
 at the Methodist Church.They go on    
 rambles, have cook-ups &amp; go camping.  </content>
