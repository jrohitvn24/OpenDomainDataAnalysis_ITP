 school.I went into my classroom,and

{language work}and saw a television    
 programme about the Domesday Project. 
    At noon, we had our hour long lunch
 break.I ate all my{chicken{pasty}which

 we learnt some ordnance survey symbols
 and used them in the maps we drew of  
 an imaginary Island. Then we had{games
