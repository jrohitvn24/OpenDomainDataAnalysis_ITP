		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO PENSARN</title>
		<content>    Pensarn is an offshoot area of     
 Abergele. It has all the trappings of 
 a small village: grocer's,            
{supermarket,}post office, newsagents, 
 hairdresser's, general store,         
 catalogue shop, pubs and a garage.The 
 only thing which divides Pensarn from 
 Abergele is a by-pass.                
    Pensarn has a{railway station}which
 may be closed down in the future as it
 is uneconomical.                      
    However, one source of finance     
 Pensarn can be certain of is the      
 stretch of beach. There are two cafes,
 a block of Victorian-style toilets,   
 two amusement arcades, a tiny fair and
 a caravan site. There are also day    
 chalets, many seating facilities and  
 an Information Bureau, all catering   
 for the tourist and his pocket. But,  
 Pensarn, like other beaches along the 
 coast, has fallen foul of{pollution.  </content>
