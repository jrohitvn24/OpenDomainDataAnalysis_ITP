		<title>20THE DYSENTERY OUTBREAK</title>
		<content>   At the beginning of May.St.Philip   
 Evans school together with Oakfield in
 Trowbridge were hit with an outbreak  
 of dysentery.A high number of children
 were reported to have sickness and    
 diarrhoea.                            
   Initially in St.Philip Evans,about  
 20 children were affected.In the      
 infants a further 20 children were    
 also affected.Even in the juniors 11  
 cases were reported.Most of these     
 cases were in families,though several 
 staff had to have dysentery tests.    
   If a child was suspected of         
 dysentery their parents were advised  
 to take their child to the doctors and
 tell the doctor of the outbreak of    
 dysentery in the school.If the tests  
 showed symptoms of dysentry,they were 
 advised to stay away from school for a
 week or two.By late June,the out break
 was over except in isolated cases.    </content>
