  The present Rosemarket church was    
 built around the year 1110 probably on
 the site of a much older Welsh church.
 Between twelve and twenty people      
 attend church regularly, about the    
 same number as have been going for the
 last 25 years.                        
  Communion services are held every    
 Sunday morning.There is an evening    
 service once a month.                 
  The vicar lives at Burton where he is
 the rector.A parochial church council 
 is elected each year to help run the  
 church.This year electric heating has 
 been installed to replace the oil     
 fired heating that broke down.The new 
 heating includes tubular heaters under
 some of the seats.
