		<content> How longe have you lived in this area?
 I have lived here since 1934.         
 Has the area changed much?            
 Not to much,but the Tunnel Cement is a
 big difference.It started in the early
 50's.                                 
 Could you explain the radio towers?   
 They were built late 1939.There's two 
 of them.There's also a lookout post on
 the hill.                             
 Did you ever see any german planes?   
 There were lots of them every night , 
 also bombs were dropped.              
 Can you explain the bunker system?    
 They were built with the radio towers 
 to protect us from the bombing.       
 What are you doing on the farm this   
 present day?                          
 Now I am a quite succesful dairy      
 farmer.I own a farm of 80 acres.Now   
 whenever I want anything I go down to 
 the village of Penyffordd.            </content>
