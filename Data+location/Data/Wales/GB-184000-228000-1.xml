		<title>01Headwaters The River Solva</title>
		<content> The southern portion of this block    
 forms the catchment area of the river 
 Solva which flows into St Brides Bay  
 10 miles away.The northern part of the
 block slopes toward the north draining
 into the western arm of the river     
 Cleddau. Most of the ground is around 
 400 feet a.s.l and due to its exposure
 to the prevailing south westerly winds
 from the Atlantic Ocean is largely    
 treelss. The area is given over to    
 agriculture being almost equally dairy
 farming and arable although a small   
 area of horticulture exists in the    
 east.The river Solva offers poor      
 drainage which has caused a certain   
 amount of bog land much of which has  
 been reclaimed but is only suitable   
 for grazing. Most of the farms are    
 small family run enterprises.The first
 language of the natives is Welsh but  
 few incomers bother to learn it.      </content>
