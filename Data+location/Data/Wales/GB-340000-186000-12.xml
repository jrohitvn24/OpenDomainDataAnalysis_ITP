		<title>12Housing in Magor</title>
		<content>  Since the begining of the 20th       
 Century the population of Magor has   
 grown rapidly.In the begining there   
 were just a few houses dotted around  
 and a few have survived with a        
 preservation order,to make sure that  
 the older buildings are not           
 demolished.                           
  Near the square are all the old      
 houses dating from the 1600's,these   
 deserve to be protected.Quite a few   
 have been turned into shops.There are 
 many new estates around the area,for  
 example the area near Queens Gardens  
 is called Blenheim Gardens and        
 Blenheim Avenue.At the moment Blenheim
 Avenue is in the process of being     
 created.                              
  There are also two,small,neat little 
 estates called Arlington close and    
 Rectory Gardens in Undy.Withy close is
 built by the council.                 </content>
