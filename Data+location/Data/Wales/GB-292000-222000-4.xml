 The climate of the area is typical of 
 the uplands of south and mid-Wales,   
 being cool,wet,windy and cloudy at all
 seasons.  There are no long-continued 
 records for any meteorological stat-  
 ions within the area but there is an  
 important set of temperature records  
 for two mountain sites. These were    
 collected by Professor J.Oliver,form- 
 erly of the University College of     
 Swansea for the 26 months from Oct.   
 1958 through April 1961. This work is 
 described in the TRANS. INSTITUTE OF  
 BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS,35,1964.          
 The two stations were located at:-    
 1)The summit of Fan Frynych(629metres)
 2)Pont Blaen-cwm ddu (373 metres) on  
 the southern slopes of Fan Frynych.
