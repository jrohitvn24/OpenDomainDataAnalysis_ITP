		<title>08Buildings in Eglwysbach</title>
		<content> There are many old buildings and farms
 in Eglwysbach. Some of the farms are  
 Plas Llan, Henblas, Cefn Coed Uchaf,  
 Pen-y-bryn, Meddiant Uchaf, Llety and 
 Croesonnen. One of the oldest is Plas 
 Llan which was built in 1684. The old 
 country mansions in Eglwysbach are    
 Pennant, Bodnant and Old Bodnod.      
 Pennant was built in 1543. The Rev.   
 Holland Edwards lived in Pennant and  
 his sister married the Rev. John      
 Bolger and then went to live there.   
 The Pochin family lived in Bodnant,   
 which was built about 400 years ago.  
 Colonel Hanmer lived in Old Bodnod.   
 St. Martin's Church was built in 1835.
 Some houses in Eglwysbach were built  
 between 1847 and 1900. Many have the  
 date of building on them. In the      
 village we have two chapels called    
 Ebenezer and Bethania, which was built
 in 1884.                              </content>
