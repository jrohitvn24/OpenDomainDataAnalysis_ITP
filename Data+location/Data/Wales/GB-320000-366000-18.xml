 and Rhydymwyn is dotted with disused

 winding wheel is still in position.

 for moving local lead. It was closed  
 in the 1960's.                        
{Lime Kilns}-used for burning lime for 
 fertilizer.                           
{Ruby Brickworks}-built about a century
 ago, but no longer in use. Some of the
 kilns are still standing.             
{The Leete}(Rhydymwyn)-a "canal" built 
 to provide water power for the old    
 foundry and corn mill on its banks.   
{Wat's Dyke}-the remains of the barrier

 in the 8th. Century.
