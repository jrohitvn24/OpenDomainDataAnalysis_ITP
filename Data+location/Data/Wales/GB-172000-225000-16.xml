		<content>  The Pembrokshire Coast National Park 
 is an organization to help promote    
 tourism and to keep the natural beauty
 of the coastal path from being        
 destroyed.The actual coastal path     
 stretches a massive 168 miles around  
 the Pembrokshire coast outlining most 
 of the 225 square miles of Dyfed that 
 the National Park covers.The          
 population of the area of the park is 
 about 20,000 people which is high by  
 any National Park's standards.In the  
 year 1952 it was finally designated a 
 National Park.Such places as the      
 Preselies are covered by the park and 
 there are many islands such as        
 Ramsey,Skomer,Grassholm and Skokholm  
 which supports large numbers of       
 wildlife.I hope that the National Park
 carries on with the good work in the  
 future.
