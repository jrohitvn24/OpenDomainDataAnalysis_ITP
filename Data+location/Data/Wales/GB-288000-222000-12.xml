		<content> By the end of the nineteenth century  
 the size of the Cnewr Company flocks  
 had increased to avout 14,000 head of 
 sheep.  Now it is somewhat smaller.   
 For example, there were about 11,000  
 breeding ewes in the nineteen thirties
 which, by 1980, had declined to 5,200.
 The NEATH AND BRECON RAILWAY, the form
 -er track of which passes through the 
 middle of the estate, was completed   
 about 10 years after McTurk came to   
 Cnewr.  This provided an important    
 transport link from the station at    
 Crai, which is only a mile or so from 
 Cnewr, to move animals and wool for   
 sale and slaughter. At that time the  
 wool crop used to be sent by rail to  
 Scotland, where better prices obtain- 
 ed. Moreover Robert McTurk also obtain
 -ed a lease on land at Llywncyntefin  
 near Sennybridge giving easy access to
 the annual sheep sale still held there</content>
