		<content> With the closure of the Great Mountain
 Colliery in the 50's a small factory  
 was built and opened during those     
 years in Bethesda Road, Tumble. Its   
 chief purpose was to provide work for 
 unemployed miners. The factory is now 
 the main source of work in Tumble. The
 present occupiers in July, 1985 are   
 Brockhouse Modernfold Ltd., who make  
 folding doors and operable movable    
 walls and partitions from P.V.C.      
 materials, metal and wood.            
 45 people are employed, 25 of whom    
 live in Tumble and the remaining 20   
 travel to work by private cars from   
 the surrounding area. The products are
 sold by sales representatives and     
 distributors, they are also exported  
 to Saudi Arabia, Africa, France and   
 Pakistan.
