		<content>   The area is well served by a close  
 network of narrow country lanes, and  
 is crossed by the main A548 Abergele  
 to Llanrwst road from north to south  
 and by the B5381 Betws-yn-Rhos road   
 from east to west. This road follows  
 the line of a Roman road built between
 Deva (Chester) and Kanovium, an       
 auxilliary fort in the Conwy Valley   
 near Tyn-y-Groes.                     
   The A548 is the route of the two bus
 services which provide a link with the
 main coast road. Most people in the   
 area are of the opinion that the      
 frequency of the services is          
 inadequate and most rely on their own 
 car or other transport. Young people  
 find it most difficult to travel      
 around.                               
   The two commercial amenities are    
 situated at the junction of the two   
 main roads.                           </content>
