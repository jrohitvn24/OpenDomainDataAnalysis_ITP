		<content> The surveyed area lies to the         
 south-west of {CARDIFF}being  situated
 midway between the city and the       
 coastal town of {BARRY}.   The region 
 is best described as an undulating    
 lowland with no place exceeding 400   
 feet (130 metres) in height above sea 
 level.   Indeed, much of the district 
 is below 300 feet (95 metres) and     
 almost entirely dominated by rural    
 countryside.   Only in the extreme    
 south-east does the expanding village 
 of Dinas Powys encroach into this     
 area.   Geologically the region can be
 divided into two distinctive rock     
 types:  Limestone dating back some 350
 million years (Carboniferous)         
 dominates the higher elevations,      
 whilst Triassic marls (180 million    
 years) form much of the lower aspects.
