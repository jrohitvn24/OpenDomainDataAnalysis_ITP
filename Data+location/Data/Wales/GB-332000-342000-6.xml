		<content> AMENITIES AND SOCIAL LIFE.            
 There are no amenities and little in  
 the way of social life in the area    
 itself. The Wynnstay Kennels have kept
 foxhounds since 1749 and the Wynnstay 
 Hunt still continues but attracts     
 mainly people from outside the area.  
 There is also a private pheasant      
 shoot.The local ''point to point'' was
 ended in 1937. There is one public    
 house in the area and three just      
 outside.There is a caravan park in    
 the area which is much used . There   
 are branches of the Women's Institute 
 at Erbistock and Eyton.There is no    
 doctor's surgery or police station    
 now.All the local shops have closed   
 over the last ten years.There is only 
 one shop, the Erbistock Post Office   
 serving the area.The Penylan and      
 Erbistock schools have closed.Children
 go to Eyton school by bus.            </content>
