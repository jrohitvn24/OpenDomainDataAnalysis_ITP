		<content> We looked in the{ARGUS}local newspaper
 for events which had happened from    
 June 24-30. One of the little girls in
 our first year had a new baby brother.
 He weighed 12lbs 3ozs and was called  
 John. His mother was really excited.  
 She said she wanted him to grow up to 
 be a rugby player. 50 children from   
 St. Joseph's High School learnt about 
 life saving techniques at the new     
 Newport Leisure Centre. The Ebbw      
 Bridge Baptist church closed on Sunday
 as their tin hut,which used to be     
 football changing rooms,is being      
 replaced by a new one. Children at    
 Duffryn High School were sent home as 
 their teachers were on a one day      
 strike. There  was a bed race at      
 Tredegar House on Sunday.
