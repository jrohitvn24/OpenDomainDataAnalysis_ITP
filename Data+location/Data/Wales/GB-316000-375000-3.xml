		<content> The'healing waters'of the'holy well'of
{St.Winefride}have been a{place of     
{pilgrimage}for centuries.Legend tells 
 how St.Winefride spurned the advances 
 of Prince Caradoc,who in his rage,cut 
 off her head.Where her head touched   
 the soil,a clear fountain of water    
 sprang forth.In the 12th century some 
 Cistertian Monks began a thriving     
 farming community at{Basingwerk Abbey 
 and by 1797 the torrent from the Well 
 had been harnessed to power corn and  
 cotton mills,copper and brass works.  
 The 1.5miles of valley which links the
 Well and Basingwerk saw the dawning of
 the{Industrial Revolution in N.Wales  
 and Holywell prospered to become a    
 leading world centre for lead mining  
 during this period.Pantasaph's found- 
 ation stone was laid in 1858. By 1875 
 the Capuchin Friars had constructed   
 their 14 Stations of the Cross.       </content>
