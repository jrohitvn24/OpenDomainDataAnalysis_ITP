		<content> Mumbles is a major centre for tourism.
 On summer evenings crowds gather to   
 stroll and watch windsurfers and      
 dinghy sailors.Oystermouth Castle is  
 a 13th Century fortress overlooking   
 the bay.For children there are parks  
 and amusements as well as a Helter    
 Skelter at the entrance to the Pier,  
 which juts out 800 feet into the bay. 
 Hotels charge from Â£15 to Â£25 a night,
 while guest houses only cost between  
 Â£6 and Â£10 a night.Behind the         
 promenade the main road is full of    
 hotels,guest houses and restaurants.  
 Fishermen's cottages are set into the 
 steep hillside.Some of these can be   
 rented in the holiday season.Many     
 tourists come for the fine beaches of 
 Bracelet,Limeslade,Rotherslade and    
 Langland.
