		<content> Caves: There are several caves in the 
 limestone here, although the entrances
 are usually small and not obvious     
 landscape features. In the Alyn Gorge 
 local cavers  have discovered two     
 major caves in recent years. Ogof Hesp
 Alyn became the first cave in North   
 Wales to be explored to over 2km,     
 following the difficult exploration of
 a long extension to the previously    
 known section. Ogof Hen Ffynonhonan is
 800m in length. It has an underground 
 stream,fed by water from swallow-holes
 in the River Alyn, which flows through
 a sizeable passage. There is also one 
 very large chamber and some stalactite
 formations. This cave is now showing  
 signs of 'human erosion', due to its  
 popularity with parties of cavers. The
 'Site of Special Scientific Interest' 
 here includes both these cave systems,
 protecting them for the future.       </content>
