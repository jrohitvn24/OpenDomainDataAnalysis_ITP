 The conifer plantations of Mynydd     
 Margam are part of Margam Forest owned
 by the Forestry Commission.  Here 85% 
 of the trees are Sitka Spruce, 12%    
 larch and the remainder Abies grande. 
 Mynydd Margam is dotted with tumuli   
 and earthworks.  Present is a replica 
 of the Bodvoc stone which stands in   
 the north east of the plantation and  
 marks the grave of a C6th chieftain.  
 Fallow deer which have escaped from   
 Margam Park are widely distributed.  A
 number of upland farms have been      
 abandoned, Blaen Maelwg has been      
 bulldozed, its land planted with      
 conifers.  Near large urban centres,  
 for years it had one of the worst fire
 records in the country.
