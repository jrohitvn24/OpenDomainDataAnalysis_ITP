		<title>03The homes we live in.</title>
		<content>      On my way to school I see old    
 terraced houses and stone semi-       
 detached and detached houses on the   
 main roads. Many of the old stone     
 houses have been improved. My home is 
 in the middle of a council estate but 
 like many of our neighbours my parents
 have recently bought it from the      
 council. Some of my friends live on   
 the estates of semi-detached houses   
 which are quite new and privately     
 owned.                                
      The only flats I see are         
 owned by the council. Elderly people  
 live in them.                         
      Most of the bungalows I see are  
 on two private estates in our area.   
 Some are detached and others are      
 semi-detached. The council own a small
 number of bungalows and keep them for 
 elderly or handicapped people.
