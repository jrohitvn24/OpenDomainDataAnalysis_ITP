		<title>05FISH FARMING IN BURTON</title>
		<content>   There are three{Fish Farms}on the   
{River Cleddau}where Fish Farmers breed
{Salmon}and{Trout.                     
   One of the{Fish Farms}is very near  
 the shore,on the south side of the    
 river,on the site where once the      
 "Warrior",the first iron clad war ship
 was berthed.The other{Fish Farms}are  
 further up river and the Fish Farmers 
 have to go out in boats to get to     
 their stocks.                         
   The farms are a series of cages,    
 which are wooden frames covered       
 with netting going down under         
 the water.When the fish grow big      
 enough,they are caught,killed and     
 sold.                                 
   Even in the roughest weather,the men
 have to go out to feed the fish with  
 special pellets of meat.              
                                       
                                       </content>
