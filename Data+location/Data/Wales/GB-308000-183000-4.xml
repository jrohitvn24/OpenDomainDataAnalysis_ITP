		<content> During the last fifteen years or so,  
 this area seems to have become        
 attractive to city dwellers.          
 Most people who have moved from the   
 city to the "country" seem to have    
 done so for the peaceful life. They   
 are people who have become worried by 
 the ever increasing muggings, violence
 and robberies now found in the large  
 towns and cities.                     
 Small villages are an attractive      
 alternative, particularly if, like    
 those in this area, they are largely  
 undeveloped and sited in areas of     
 natural beauty.                       
 To newcomers, villages like Efail Isaf
 and Gwaelod-y-Garth offer a quiet,    
 secure and peaceful life with the     
 advantage of the ammenities of the    
 towns and city being within easy      
 reach.                                
                                       </content>
