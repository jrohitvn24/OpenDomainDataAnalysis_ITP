       In 1945 I had just turned 14    
 and I have left school.There were     
 plenty of jobs around then so I had   
 one straight away.It was in High      
 Level.I had to lie on my stomach and  
 shovel coal and the seam was only     
 2feet 6inches high and in some places 
 I can remember it being a mere        
 18inches high,the pay was very poor   
 but it was something.I gave all my pay
 to my mother as it was very hard to   
 feed and cloth 9 children.I only had  
 one set of clothes and I wore these   
 everywhere,even on Sunday to Chapel.We
 used to go to the temple in           
 Newbridge.I liked going to Chapel     
 because in the summer they would      
 organise trips to Barry and Porthcawl.
