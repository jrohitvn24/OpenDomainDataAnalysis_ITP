		<title>03Garway School in 1928</title>
		<content> We went to talk to Mrs Lloyd, who has 
 lived in Garway all her life. When Mrs
 Lloyd was at school in 1928 she had to
 walk, and some children used to walk  
 miles to get here. Once a year the    
 children walked from the school to    
 Glanmonnow, about 2 miles away, where 
 they were given a 'treat' of tea      
 followed by games on the lawn. When   
 they got back to school many of the   
 children still had to walk home miles 
 to get to Garway Hill. They used to   
 start school at the same time as us,  
 and if they weren't at school when the
 bell rang they got into lots of       
 trouble. They did sewing, embroidery, 
 poetry and all the things we do now at
 school. Mr Wallace, the headmaster,   
 used to take carpentry. They also did 
 gardening. He had a cane that he      
 called Friend John, but it wasn't a   
 friend for the children.              </content>
