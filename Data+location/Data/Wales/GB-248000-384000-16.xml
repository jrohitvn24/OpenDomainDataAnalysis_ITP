		<title>16MOVING IN TO MOELFRE</title>
		<content> We came to live here because my mum   
 and dad came here on holiday. They    
 liked the fresh air, the quiet and the
 beaches. When they went back to       
 Manchester it was so noisy and busy   
 that they did not like it one bit.    
 They decided to move here. My dad had 
 just finished in building college so  
 he became a self-employed builder when
 we moved to Anglesey.                 
           My mum worked in an office, 
 but there was no work for her here, so
 she became a housewife.
