		<title>18FIRE AT THE CHURCH!</title>
		<content>The fire began around 8.45 on January 9
1985. At 9.00 there was a banging at   
the curate's door and someone told him 
that the church was on fire. He was    
asked to go into the church to point   
out items of interest to the fire      
chief. When the thick smoke had cleared
they could see the full extent of the  
damage: the boiler house had set light 
to the organ which in turn set light to
the north aisle roof. The plastic hooks
supporting the lighting melted and     
created a wierd effect with wires      
hanging about 30 feet above the floor. 
The resins in the wooden beams ran out 
onto the floor creating intense heat.  
The fire eventually was brought under  
control. Everything in the area was    
destroyed. Fortunately the stained     
glass window had been moved from its   
original position and was not damaged. 
Approx. value of damage 150000 pounds. </content>
