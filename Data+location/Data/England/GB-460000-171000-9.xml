		<title>09THEALE GREEN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In 1962 Ken Shield was appointed to   
 set up a Grammar School at Theale.    
 After 22 years as Headmaster he       
 retired in 1985. He had appointed all 
 the members of staff and the ethos of 
 the school was his. There is a strong 
 emphasis on the pastoral system and   
 there has been an attempt to continue 
 in the comprehensive the family life  
 and atmosphere which had been built up
 in the Grammar School. The eagle in   
 the school crest refers to both the   
 Roman presence and a passage in Isaiah
 which refers to a soaring eagle. The  
 aim of the school has been to show the
 pupils the importance of the past and 
 that they, if working properly and    
 with the right support, can soar to   
 the heights.
