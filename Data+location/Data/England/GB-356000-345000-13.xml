 villages of Wrenbury and Marbury.

 consisted of properties some dating   
 from the 16th century.This small      
 community was enlarged by a sizeable  
 council estate,(circa 1948) a private 
 development mainly bungalows built    
 about 1968 and a modern estate of     
 detached houses post 1980.Infilling   
 has taken place over the years.       
{MARBURY}in the south west corner is a 
 very small village with a variety  of 
 architectural styles of an individual
