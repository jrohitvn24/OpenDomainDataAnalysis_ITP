		<content> Historically the local economy has    
 been dominated by{metal}and{          
{engineering industries}.Most companies
 are fairly small,employing less than  
 500 people.The tradition of the       
 skilled craftsmansetting up his own   
 small business is still strong.       
  A wide variety of metal goods is     
 produced,from heavy engineering       
 castings to nuts and bolts.Amongst the
 many engineering firms are those      
 producing components for the car      
 industry,and machine tools.           
  There are also{plastics,textile,     
{chemical}and {construction industries,
 and newer companies using the latest{ 
{computerised manufacturing technology.
{Service industries}too are growing in 
 importance.                           
  This is a period of{recession,       
 especially in traditional metal based 
 industries so unemployment has risen. </content>
