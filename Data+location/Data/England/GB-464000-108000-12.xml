		<title>12PLANT FARM</title>
		<content> Records show that the farm has been   
 there since 1200AD and is situated    
 near the old Roman road from          
 Fishbourne to Portchester on the      
 southern edge of the Forest Of Bere.  
 The local name for the area is Forest 
 End.  The farm covers 260 acres and is
 used mainly for crops which are sown  
 in winter or spring and reaped the    
 following year.   115 acres of        
 wheat,60 acres of barley, 30 acres of 
 oats and 20 acres of potatoes comprise
 the crops shown.  The remaining 35    
 acres are too wet to plough for crops 
 so they are used for grassland to feed
 30 Friesan beef cattle in summer and  
 to provide hay for feeding them in    
 winter.  The cattle are bought when   
 they are 10 weeks old and are sold    
 when they are 2 years old. Plant Farm 
 is 1 of 20 farms on the Southwick     
 Estate which covers 5000 acres in all.</content>
