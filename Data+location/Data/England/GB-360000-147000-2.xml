 countryside.Gurney Slade has limestone
 quarries some of which have closed.

 parents and grandparents were born in 
 the surrounding area. Most people now 
 have to travel away from the village  
 for employment.There is a primary     
 school with 56 children when they are

 nearby towns.Local events are centred 
 in the villages with a gymkhana and   
 fetes in aid of the church and        
 school.Social life is centred round   
 the two public houses with skittles   
 and darts teams. There are many clubs 
 for young and old. Binegar is a quiet 
 rural area  while Gurney slade is     
 busier with main road,quarry traffic  
 and two village shops.                </content>
