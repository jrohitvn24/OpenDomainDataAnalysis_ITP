 I get up at 8.00 am have a wash and   
 get dressed and have my breakfast at  
 about 8.15 am.I usually have          
 cornflakes.Then I put all my things   
 into my bag.I put in there my daps    
 (plimsoles) and lunch box. I go to    
 school at 8.50 am. The register is    
 taken and followed by a Maths lesson. 
 After a break is English. Dinner is at
 12.00. I have packed lunch. After     
 dinner we have a break for half an    
 hour before we come in and do topic   
 work. We have a story at about 3.00   
 until hometime which at 3.30.I go home
 and have a cooked tea .If it is fine I
 go out to play at about 5.00. My      
 favourite play place is the golf      
 course. I come home at 7.30 and have a
 bath. I have supper,clean my teeth    
 and go to bed at 9.00.                </content>
