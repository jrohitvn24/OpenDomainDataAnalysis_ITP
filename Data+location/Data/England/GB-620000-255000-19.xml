I get up at 8 o'clock and have         
breakfast.Then I get dressed and have a
wash.I normally have cornflakes for    
breakfast and a glass of milk.Then I   
pack my bag for school.I put my lunch  
box and my flask in it and make  sure  
that I have got my reading book.I go to
school at 8.45.School starts at 9.00.  
First of all there is an assembly.After
assembly we normally do some number    
work.During the morning we do some     
language work.I like this best of all. 
School dinner is from 12.00-1,15.In    
the afternoon we have games or art or  
needlework.School ends at 3.30.All of  
the children go home at the same time. 
When I get home I like to watch t.v.for
a while.Sometimes I have homework to   
do.I normally go to bed at 9.00.Ilike  
going to school,I'm looking forward to 
going to the middle school.            </content>
