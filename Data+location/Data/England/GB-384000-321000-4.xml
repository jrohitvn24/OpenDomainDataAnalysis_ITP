After  the Second World War,  outsiders
moved in to manage farms or new tenants
took  over.  Farms  were  often  joined
together   and   small   self-contained
pockets of the community were dispersed
in favour of larger-scale  enterprises.
Mechanisation also rapidly reduced  the
need for manpower. Common Market  rules
and regulations have taken away much of
the  old  independence of  the  farming
community.
