		<title>04A Farm Worker's Typical Day.</title>
		<content>   I decided to be a{farmer}because I  
 enjoy the outdoor life. Although I    
 like my job the hours are long. Work  
 starts at 5.00am and usually finishes 
 at 5.00pm but in the summer I may help
 with the{hay-making}in the evenings.  
   I travel to various farms in a land-
 rover and carry out{general farmwork. 
 My daily jobs consist of two hours    
{milking}which I do when I have brought
 in the cows. The milk tank has to be  
 washed out ready for milking. After   
 taking an hour for breakfast at seven 
 o'clock I continue with jobs such as  
 cleaning calf boxes, haying, watering 
 calves, checking stocks in far fields 
 and preparing for other feeds.        
   From about 12.30pm to 1.30pm I go   
 home for lunch. I then prepare for the
 afternoon milking. There will be other
 jobs to do before going home.
