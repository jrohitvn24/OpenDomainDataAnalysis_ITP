  For many years Norwich has had       
{severe}traffic problems such as       
 congestion at roundabouts and major   
 junctions.                            
  To overcome these problems several   
 ideas have beens developed.An{Inner   
{Ring Road}was built comprising of a   
{flyover,roundabouts}at the principal  
 junctions and{dual carriageway}roads.A
{one-way system}was introduced but this
 led to greater congestion at some     
 roundabouts.To combat this,{traffic   
{lights}were added at the roundabouts. 
{ Television cameras}keep a watchful   
 eye on the traffic flow and observers 
 use this information to program a     
 computer which is linked to a traffic 
 light control.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
