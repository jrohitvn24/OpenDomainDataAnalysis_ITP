		<title>12Reservoirs and Old Quarries</title>
		<content> At the western end of the area are    
 two reservoirs built in the early     
 1900s which now serve the twon of     
 Longridge.   The intake for these     
 reservoirs being the streams of Dean  
 and Cowley situated farther east on   
 the Fell, and suplemented by a piped  
 supply from the large reservoirs built
 to serve Preston and situated to the  
 south of Longridge.                   
                                       
 The old stone quarry, now a           
 residential and touring caravan site  
 provided the stone for the Municipal  
 buildings in Preston and was quarried 
 extensively in the 1830s.   Nearby is 
 the old Copy Quarry which was         
 re-opened to extract stone for the    
 Broughton to Blackpool motorway in    
 the 1970s.   This has since been      
 landscaped and an angling society has 
 the fishing rights to the pond.       </content>
