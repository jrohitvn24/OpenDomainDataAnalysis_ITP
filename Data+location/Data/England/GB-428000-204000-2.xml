		<title>02CARTERTON. A GROWING TOWN</title>
		<content>{Carterton}began as a small {market    
{gardening community}famous for its    
 tomatoes. The arrival of the airfield 
 led naturally to growth but the rapid 
 development of the last decade is     
 probably due to the demand for more   
 housing in the {Oxford }and {Witney } 
 area. House building has outstripped  
 the development of shopping and       
 recreational facilities and the town  
 council is working to achieve a       
 balance.More shops are planned and    
 recreation areas are being sought but 
 space around the town centre is       
 limited. The townspeople want their   
 own fire station,better policing and  
 it is hoped to provide more for the   
 youth of the area as they have no     
 meeting places apart from the youth   
 club.The town council is also pressing
 for better road links in the hope of  
 attracting industry to the area.      </content>
