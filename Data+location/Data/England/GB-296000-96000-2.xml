		<content> When I got up I went to wash and then 
 I went to dress.After that I went down
 stairs  and I had my breakfast, then I
 got ready for school.Then I got on my 
 bike and went to school.When I got    
 there we played football on the play  
 ground.Then the bell rang and we had  
 to go in and Mr Cotton called the     
 register and I took my dinner money to
 him.Then we had assembly.After that we
 did more work and then it was dinner. 
      We played football for half an   
 hour.After we had dinner,we did some  
 work on shapes but mine went wrong.   
 After that I did some maths and then  
 it was afternoon break.After that     
 they did P.E. but I did not because I 
 got told off for talking.When it was  
 home time I rode home.I went to my    
 green house and watered my beans. I   
 had my tea  ,I watched tv and went to 
 bed at nine o'clock. {                </content>
