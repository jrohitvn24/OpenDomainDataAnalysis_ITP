		<content> The biggest wood in the area is Great 
 Covert which has a path through it    
 called Dirty Drive.                   
 The trees are mainly coniferous Pine  
 and Spruce with some deciduous Oak and
 Beech.                                
                                       
 The area is quite flat with many paths
 through it. There are many animals in 
 the area including pheasants, grass   
 snakes, rabbits, deer, squirrels and  
 badgers. Shot guns are used to scare  
 away and kill rabbits and other farm  
 pests.                                
                                       
 We saw the following types of flowers 
 primrose, bluebells and daisies.      
                                       
 There is also a small game reserve.   
                                       
 Some of the woodland is being cut down
 for residential purposes.             </content>
