		<content> We found the villagers were interested
 in very different things.They were as 
 follows:photography, knitting,painting
 D.I.Y., decorating and pottery.       
    Some unusual ones were dog         
 breeding, and one man had done D.I.Y. 
 for 51 years.Other hobbies were:      
 singing, embroidery, sailing and sport
 in general.Most people had been       
 occupied by their interests for more  
 than 20 years.We found also that      
 people from the age of 8 to 13 had    
 sport as their main interest, and     
 people from the age of 14 to 40 had   
 sport, knitting and D.I.Y. as their   
 interests.People from 41 to 70 had    
 D.I.Y. and gardening as their main    
 interests.In the evening T.V. is      
 commonly watched as a pastime.
