		<title>12LIFE IN LONG WITTENHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
The best thing about living in Long    
Wittenham is being near the river.     
When we first came to Long Wittenham   
we couldn't live in our house because  
it was very old  and wrecked.  We had  
to live in my grandma's house while we 
did up our house.  It was good because 
of this.  We keep a{ goat} and some    
chickens.  We sell the eggs but we     
don't sell the goats milk.  In Long    
Wittenham there isn't much to do.
