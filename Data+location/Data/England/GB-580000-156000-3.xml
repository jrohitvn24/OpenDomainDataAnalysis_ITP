		<title>03A FAMILY BUSINESS</title>
		<content> Today, running a business entails more
 work and responsibility both to myself
 and the public. Once time stood still;
 now more money has to be taken in     
 order to cover increased costs and an 
 alarm system is a necessity to guard  
 increased value of stock. Value added 
 tax and P.A.Y.E. takes time to work   
 out. We carry sidelines in the form of
 horticultural aids as well as         
 stationery, sweets and newspapers.    
 Once the newspapers were delivered by 
 young boys and girls. This is no      
 longer economical so personal folders 
 are now used and customers collect    
 their own. However in spite of certain
 difficulties, my family business is   
 enjoyable and interesting, bringing me
 into contact with many local          
 inhabitants.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
