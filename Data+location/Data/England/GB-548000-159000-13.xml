		<title>13The River Darent,Shoreham.</title>
		<content>  The{river Darent}has played an       
 important part in the life of         
 Shoreham.At one time there were three 
 working mills in Shoreham.Nowadays,   
 with the advances in technology and   
 the reduced flow of the river,its     
 value as an amenity is as a fishing   
 centre and for its beauty.            
                                       
  Mrs. Pollock's garden is bordered on 
 two sides by the river.{Kingfishers}  
 and{dragonflies}can be seen there.    
 Among other plants and shrubs are     
{Cricket Bat Willow}trees.When their   
 trunks are 50cm wide,they are cut down
 to make cricket bats.Another tree is  
 always planted to replace the cut one.
                                       
  The river flowing under the{part 14th
{Century}bridge is so picturesque that 
 many people come to see it.
