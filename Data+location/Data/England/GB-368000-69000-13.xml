		<title>13Quarrying</title>
		<content> A visitor going to a modern quarry on 
 Portland would find channelling       
 machines moving to and fro on their   
 short tracks cutting furrows in the   
 solid rock, enormous cranes swinging  
 huge blocks from place to place and   
 then big machines carrying the blocks 
 away for cutting.  Occasionally       
 explosions can be heard which are     
 followed by splinters of rock filling 
 the air.  The sound of thudding drills
 and heavy hammers wielded by brawny   
 arms can always be heard.  rectangular
 masses of stone weighing many tonnes  
 are loosened from the mother rock,    
 then great big cranes load them onto  
 trucks which take then to the stone   
 mill.  The blocks of limestone are    
 shaped for building purposes or       
 crushed to make road chippings.
