		<title>11  Miller's Dale Estate</title>
		<content> In{Miller's Dale}there is a{farmhouse}
 which is being made into a{pub.}It was
 built in the early 18th century and   
 extended in the 19th century.         
 The farm was sold to the{Cranbury Park
{Estate}at the same time as Ford Farm  
 and now looks desolate in the{Miller's
{Dale}housing development.             
 It is now a grade 2 listed building.  
 In the 1920's a{secret room}was       
 discovered and a lace glove was found.
 It was dated as about 300 years old.  
                                       
 The houses on Miller's Dale are nice  
 because the gardens are looked after  
 very well and the roads are smooth. At
 the beginning of each road there are  
 bumps to stop cars going fast.        
                                       
 There is a Community Centre, a        
 Doctor's Surgery and a Nature Reserve 
 with a river going through it.        </content>
