    Fr. Breandan McDonald has been at  
 Holy Family Parish since 1967 when he 
 was asked by the Bishop to leave his  
 job as a curate of St. Joseph's, Sale 
 and start a new parish of Holy Family.
 As there was already a school in the  
 parish, Father McDonald's first job   
 was to find himself somewhere to live.
 He bought no. 65 Old Hall Road, a     
 house facing the school and with the  
 help of the parishioners set up a     
 presbytery in September 1967. During  
 the following years Father McDonald   
 again with the help of the            
 parishioners organized many social    
 events in order to raise money for the
 building of a new church which was    
 opened in December 1975.
