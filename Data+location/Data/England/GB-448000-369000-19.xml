		<title>19UPPER LANGWITH.</title>
		<content>      Upper Langwith is a small village
 with nineteen mostly{stone-built      
{houses,}some of which date from the   
 17th Century. The village contains a  
 small{church}dating from Norman times,
 a{pub}called the Devonshire Arms,     
 named after the Lord of the Manor and 
 one{farm.}                            
      The rest of the homes are        
 owned by people engaged in a variety  
 of occupations.                       
      It's great living in upper       
 Langwith.  I live at The Cottage which
 is a stone built collection of a house
 and ten outbuildings surrounded by an 
 orchard and gardens. The orchard      
 contains a variety of fruit trees and 
 I enjoy the Autumn picking time when  
 we spend several days collecting the  
 harvest of apples, damsons, pears,    
 plums and greengages.
