		<content>  History of the reservoir.            
The reservoir covers 80 acres and was  
built in the hey-day of canal          
building,   as a feeder to the canals. 
James Brindley's name has been         
associated with the reservoir which was
finished in 1804. the country park was 
taken over by the council 10 years ago.
Work to convert it was carried out by  
the District and County Councils as    
well as community services. Today there
is one main picnic area with tables    
scattered around. Part of the bank is  
owned by th Daventry Angling Club and a
regular use of the park is made by the 
Daventry Windsurfing Club, Model Boat  
Club and the Daventry Boys Club Canoe  
Group.
