		<title>11The Hastings Holiday Centre</title>
		<content> An open air bathing pool opened 52    
 years ago at the west end of Hastings 
 promenade.Olympic measurements and    
 high diving boards drew swimmers from 
 a wide area.Leased from the local     
 council,the rather neglected pool is  
 now part of a holiday camp.Older folk 
 use the camp in the first and last 6  
 weeks of the Easter to October season.
 Families with schoolchildren come in  
 August.Linked chalets line the pool.At
 Â£60 a week it provides full board and 
 entertainment for 300 people. Visitors
 and locals use its 2 large rooms,dance
 floor,bar,snooker,amusements and      
 squash courts all year.A storm last   
 Winter filled many ground floor       
 chalets with shingle,ruining          
 furnishings.The restored pump again   
 cleans the pool,one of the few large  
 South coast ones left.The Hastings    
 Holiday Centre still has potential.   </content>
