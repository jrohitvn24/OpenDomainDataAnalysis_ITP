		<title>03Shustoke,near Coleshill.</title>
		<content> As we drove from Coleshill town due   
 east into the valley of the river     
 Blyhe we passed a few large houses and
 then the scenery changed dramatically 
 .We drove passed arable land and      
 pasture land by the river and some    
 deciduous woodland.We passed over the 
 dismantled track of the "Stonebridge  
 Railway".Our first impressions of     
 Shustoke was a quiet country village  
 but as we progressed into the village 
 we saw the busy main road went        
 straight through.The village green is 
 still there with a modern bus shelter 
 for the daily bus service to Coleshill
 .By the green is the Plough Inn and   
 the post office and stores.The other  
 facilities are a sports ground,church 
 hall and a primary school. The houses 
 include council,large ,semi-detatched 
 and some very old.It is a lovely old  
 village in the countryside.           </content>
