		<title>02A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content>  I woke up at half past seven.   I get
 dressed   Then I feed my hamster      
 next I have a wash , clean my         
 teeth and   then I put my shoes on.  I
 go downstairs and have frosties       
 and toast.    My mum makes my         
 sandwiches and I go to school.        
 When I get to school we go to         
 assembly.                             
     After assembly we do Peak Maths,  
 36O and a poster.    Then we have     
 playtime, after playtime we do some   
 more work.    Then we have dinner,    
 when we have finished we do more work.
 until playtime.    We then and have a 
 story, and finally we go home.        
     I watch TV and do my topic.   Mum 
 makes the tea and I have a shower.  I 
 watch TV again and go to bed and have 
 a read.   Then I go to sleep.
