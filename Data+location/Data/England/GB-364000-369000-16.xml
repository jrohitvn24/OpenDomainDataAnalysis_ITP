		<title>16Davenham Day Centre</title>
		<content> The health and care of the elderly is 
 the concern of the Social Services who
 administer the Day Centre. It is only 
 old people that go there and many of  
 them have a handicap. Mr Insley the   
 Manager of the Centre has the help of 
 2 cooks, 1 domestic, a hairdresser,   
 chiropodist, handycraft and 4 care    
 assistants. Nobody sleeps there but   
 the old people are collected and taken
 home by either a minibus or a taxi or 
 a taxi-lift ambulance. They have 27   
 rooms. Recreation includes snooker,   
 darts, table tennis, bingo, shuffle   
 board and dominoes plus quizzes. They 
 paint, read and write, they are helped
 with bathing, exercises and they have 
 their meals packed or made for them,  
 dinner is 90p and tea is 70p. About 40
 people go there a day and about 130 go
 there a week.
