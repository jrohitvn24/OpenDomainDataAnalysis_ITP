		<title>10Crops - Wheat and Barley</title>
		<content>   In the Dunmow area wheat and barley 
 are the most popular crops.           
   Wheat is grown in large quantities  
 because its grain is needed to make   
 cereals, flour for bread and biscuits.
 Barley is used as animal fodder and   
 for making malt for the brewing       
 industry.                             
   To ensure successful yields farmers 
 use chemicals against insects and     
 diseases.  'Smut' is a fungus which   
 changes the kernel into black powder, 
 and 'rust' causes red or black patches
 on the stems or leaves.               
   The weather is good for both crops  
 since there is plenty of sunshine in  
 Summer to help them ripen quickly.    
 Over 3 tons of grain per acre is      
 produced, and often there is a        
 surplus.  This year some of this has  
 been sent to the starving people of   
 Ethiopia.                             </content>
