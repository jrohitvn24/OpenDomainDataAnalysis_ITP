		<title>02BASLOW ROAD</title>
		<content> The A621 runs S.W. through this block 
 from the {Totley Rise }shops to the   
{Peacock Inn }on the edge of the moors.
 This busy road is now controlled by   
 lights at  its junction with Glover   
 Road.There had been great local       
 concern about the number of serious   
 accidents which had occurred on the   
 bend near to the junction.            
 Most of Totley's amenities are        
 situated along this road as far as the
 bus terminus at {The Cross Scythes    
{Inn.}Beyond this the road climbs      
 through farmland and gives extensive  
 views of the moors which are Totley's 
 'backdrop'.They include {Totley Moss }
 beneath which runs the railway        
 tunnel.The {Sheffield_Manchester line}
 through the Hope Valley &amp; Edale uses  
 the {Totley Tunnel.}
