		<title>01BROADWAY AND WILLERSEY HILL</title>
		<content> This block is on the west slopes of   
 the{Cotswold Escarpment}where the land
 falls steeply to the{Vale of Evesham  
 below. The A44 road crosses the block 
 from North-West to South-East through 
 the tourist village of{Broadway}and   
 then in a series of steep twists and  
 turns it ascends Fish Hill to the     
 Fish Inn 240 metres above the village.
 It is a rural area of great natural   
 beauty enhanced by the Cotswold stone 
 villages of{Broadway, Saintbury}and   
{Willersey} The slopes of the hills    
 are mainly grassland  with deciduous  
 tree cover and sheep grazing. In the  
 Vale below the land is farmed. There  
 are apple and plum orchards and a     
 variety of market garden crops are    
 grown. The area is criss-crossed with 
 public footpaths and is popular with  
 walkers and tourists.
