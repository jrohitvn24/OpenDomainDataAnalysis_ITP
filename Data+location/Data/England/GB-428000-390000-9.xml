{Loxley United Reformed Church,}known  
 locally as the{"Top Chapel,"}was built
 in 1787 at a cost of Â£1000 by some of 
 the congregation of Bradfield Church. 
 It was built for the curate at        
 Bradfield, who was about to be        
 dismissed, by parishioners who wanted 
 him to stay in the area. The bishop   
 was asked to consecrate it but he     
 refused because it hadn't a window in 
 the East wall. It is an attractive    
 stone building in large grounds. It   
 could be mistaken for a large house   
 rather than a Church. It is still used
 for services and the local cubs and   
 scouts use it as their base. The      
 surrounding grounds are a useful      
 campsite for them.
