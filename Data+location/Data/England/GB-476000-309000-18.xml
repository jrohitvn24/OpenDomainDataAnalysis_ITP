		<title>18*House Renovation***********</title>
		<content>The house I used to live in was two    
houses befor my Dad knocked it through 
into one.  If we hadn't have bought    
them they would have been demolished by
my Grandad who owned a large building  
firm as my Uncle does now.             
                                       
My Dad built two porches, one on the   
front and one on the back and he built 
new stairs.  He then built an extension
which is now a kitchen.  The house all 
together has 10 rooms including the    
cloak room and utility room.  It has 3 
bedrooms, one bathroom, a sitting room,
and a dining room.                     
                                       
Then Dad sold it and now we live in a  
very big house which is mostly derelict
and all the walls are having to be     
knocked down and they are full of straw
The house will be lovely when its      
finished. by Richard Michelson 10   Wri</content>
