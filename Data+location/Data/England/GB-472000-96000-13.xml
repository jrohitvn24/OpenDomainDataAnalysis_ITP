		<title>13LANGUAGE AND DIALECT</title>
		<content> When the population explosion happened
 in the 1960's Hayling turned into a   
 cosmopoliton centre as far as dialect 
 was concerned. However before that    
 there was a slight Hampshire accent   
 though not as strong as the rest of   
 the country. There are still some     
 older people in the north of Hayling  
 especially,who have retained a slight 
 trace of accent.They still use old    
 dialect words e.g. emmets,which means 
 ants.On the whole the way we speak is 
 mixed.
