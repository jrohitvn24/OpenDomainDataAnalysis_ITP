		<content> The villages of the area have         
 undergone many changes in the last    
 fifty or so years.The village of      
 Stoney Stanton no longer has any      
 quarries in use today.Many of these   
 disused quarries are being used for   
 infill of Leicester s waste.The modern
 shopping centre,small though it is,has
 been built on an old quarry reclaimed 
 just over ten years ago.As has        
 happened to much of leicestershire    
 there was an enormous increase during 
 the late 1960s and the 1970s in the   
 number of houses that were built.Both 
 Croft and Stoney Stanton have more    
 than doubled in size thereby changing 
 the character of these two            
 communities.These villages serve      
 mostly as dormitory settlements for   
 the city of Leicester.Unfortunately   
 the expansion of Croft quarry has lead
 to the destruction of old buildings.  </content>
