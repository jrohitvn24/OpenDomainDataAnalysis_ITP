		<content>Today we went to interview Mrs.Giles.  
She told us a lot of interesting things
about Braybrooke that I didn't know.Mrs
Giles said that there used to be a     
slaughter house in Braybrooke down     
Green Lane owned by Mr.Abbott (Stan).  
Next to the shop there used to be a row
of cottages.Also,the Busby's house,that
used to be 2 cottages.Next to the      
church there used to be a Green where  
the children played.In the olden days  
around 1920 the children used to go to 
the cinema for 9 old pence.If she      
wanted pocket money she had to earn    
it and then she had to give some to her
family.Mrs.Giles has lived in Bray-    
brooke for 69 years.She moved here when
she was 18 months and lived in the     
teachers house in the original school. 
Mrs. Giles used to work at the village 
shop.
