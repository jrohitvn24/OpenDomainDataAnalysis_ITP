		<title>16A Day In The Life of MRS P.</title>
		<content>  A typical day in the life of         
 a housewife.                          
   I get up at 7.00am,I shower and wash
 my hair using  vosene shampoo and     
 Imperial Leather soap.I dress,usually 
 in a dress and cardigan.Next I go down
 to prepare breakfast.We usually have  
 cereal and toast.I prepare sandwiches 
 for my son and husband.The rest of the
 family have left by 8.15am, which is  
 when I begin my housework.            
   I have lunch at 1.00pm,normally a   
 sandwich and fruit.While I am eating  
 this I watch a magazine programme on  
 television.During the afternoon I walk
 the dog.                              
   When the family come home I prepare 
 their meals.My favourite meal is an   
 Indian curry.                         
  In the evening I watch television and
 knit or read.I eventually retire at   
 about 10.30pm.                        </content>
