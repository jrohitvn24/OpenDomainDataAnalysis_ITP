		<title>15ANNUAL EVENT WARWICK BRIDGE</title>
		<content>{THE PRAM RACE}                        
 Quite a few people came to watch this 
 event.It is held once a year at       
 Easter and as well as the pram        
 race where people dress up in         
 silly costumes prizes are given for   
 the best decorated egg.Last year a    
 butterfy egg was first and a spaceman 
 was second and Worzel Gumagge was     
 third.An ice cream van,a hot dog stall
 and a jazz band who came on a         
 lorry entertained the crowd and the   
 pub gave out free meals all day.There 
 is a play ground so the children can  
 have a good time while the adults have
 a drink.Money is raised for charity.
