 Ashton was mentioned as Estone in the 
 Domesday Book ,1086. Possibly this was
 a spelling mistake for Ashton.There   
 used to be a local wood called Ash    
 Wood and Ashton means settlement      
 amongst the ash trees. It may have    
 meant east town.                      
 The most important historical find has
 been the medieval pottery kiln which  
 was found by Mr. George B. Leach,     
 in 1933, in his garden in Pentre Lane.
 It is thought the monks from Vale     
 Royal Abbey sited the kiln there      
 because they had a supply of water,   
 wood and clay.                        
 Our parish church, St. John the       
 Evangelist, was built in 1849 and is a
 very good example of church building  
 of that time. In 1985 an appeal has   
 been launched to rebuild the top 3    
 metres of the steeple.                </content>
