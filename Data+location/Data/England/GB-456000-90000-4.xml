 30th 1985. She arrived by helicopter  
 at Pell Lane. She was wearing a pin-  
 striped suit, and a sailor style hat  
 . She got here at 11 a.m.She went so  
 fast that you only got a glimpse of   
 her . My cousin saw her when she came 
 out, and they got a wave.She had her  
 lunch at the Club. After that she     
 visited a factory to help teenagers   
 who are unemployed.My Dad and Uncle   
 helped to build the new old people's  
 home because they work for Westridge  
 the builders.My Auntie and my Nan had
