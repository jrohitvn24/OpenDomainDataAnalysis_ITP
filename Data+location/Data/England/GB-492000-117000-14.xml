		<title>14CLUBS IN GRAFFHAM</title>
		<content> The badminton club has a court &amp; you  
 have to be 16 years to join. You play 
 in doubles &amp; change paretners for each
 game &amp; so gain experience. You break  
 for refreshments. The youth club began
 15 years ago. You buy sweets &amp; drinks.
 53 children go, 25 seniors &amp; 28       
 juniors. They go ice-skating &amp; to the 
 cinema. The football club began in    
 1919, by kicking an inflated pig's    
 bladder around &amp; then they joined a   
 league. They train on Wednesdays &amp;    
 play on Saturdays. They have an annual
 dinner &amp; dance, &amp; play in black &amp;     
 white. Thus the village is very active
 &amp; there should be a club to suit      
 everyone. For example other clubs are 
 tennis, bowls, weaving, amateur       
 dramatics to only name a few.
