		<content> Of necessity people here have to look 
 outside the village for work.  Farmers
 employ few local people, their labour 
 being supplied by family members.     
 There are a numer of self employed    
 tradesmen, an electrician, builder,   
 coal merchant, postmaster, grocer and 
 some of the young farmers hit by the  
 new milk quotas, have turned to  other
 jobs to supplement their income.      
 Forde Abbey with its large estate of  
 woodlands, farms self pick fruit      
 fields and tree nurseries employ some 
 villagers at agricultural rates, whole
 others take jobs in the four          
 surounding towns where there is       
 established light industry and service
 shops. Some go as far as Taunton and  
 Yeovil for their jobs.  The age       
 structure in the west is low and      
 employers are in a strong negotiating 
 position with prospective employees.  </content>
