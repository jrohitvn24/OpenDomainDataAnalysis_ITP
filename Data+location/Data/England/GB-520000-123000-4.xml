		<title>04The Blacksmith</title>
		<content> Mr Pimm has been a blacksmith for 23  
 years and he has 1 assistant. His main
 work is shoeing horses and he shoes   
 approximately 30 horses a week.       
 Sometimes he has trouble with horses  
 usually the thoroughbreds. As well as 
 horse shoeing Mr Pimm makes gates and 
 also many of his tools. His equipment 
 is now modernised and he has electric 
 bellows to heat the fire of coke. Half
 a ton of coke lasts roughly 3 months. 
 He heats the coke until it is hot     
 enough to turn the iron red. Then he  
 puts the iron on to the anvil to beat 
 it into shape. He uses hammers, tongs,
 pinchers etc to shape the iron.
