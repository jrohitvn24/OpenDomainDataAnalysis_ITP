		<title>03Fyfield and Overton Churches</title>
		<content> The registers of both churches, dating
 from 1682, have entries for both      
 villages until 1732 when separate     
 records were kept.                    
{Fyfield Church}serves Fyfield and     
 Lockeridge. It dates from the 13th    
 century, with major repairs made in   
 1634. The floor and tower are of      
 stone, the nave roof of oak. It had   
 3 bells, but one was given to Alton   
 Priors on joining Overton parish. The 
 lychgate was erected in memory of a   
 local jockey who died at Brighton     
 racecourse. Several buildings nearby  
 were demolished about 1930 for road   
 widening.                             
 The present church at{West Overton}is 
 the third one. It is built of local   
 sarsen stones, flint, bricks and Bath 
 stone dressings. The tower with 6     
 bells is reached up a winding         
 staircase.                            </content>
