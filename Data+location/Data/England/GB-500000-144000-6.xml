		<content>    Bramley is on the main A281 road to
 Cranleigh and Guildford.It has a      
 variety of shops and houses,many of   
 which date back to the 18th century.  
    It can be very noisy on week       
 days,with many lorries passing.In the 
 evenings you can play badminton,tennis
 or five aside football in the village 
 hall.There is plenty of space for     
 cricket or football on the green but  
 many people just like to walk across  
 it Bramley has many old peoples       
 homes.(eg.) Blunden Court is a block  
 of homes for pensioners.My dad works  
 in the High Street clock shop and is  
 one of the few independent clockmakers
 left in the area.
