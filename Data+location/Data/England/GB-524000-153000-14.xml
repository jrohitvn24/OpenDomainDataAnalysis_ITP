		<title>14Transport in Kingswood area</title>
		<content>    The Kingswood area is very well    
 served as far as transport is         
 concerned.                            
    By{road}the area is very close to  
 the M25 which (when completed) will   
 link up with most of the major        
{motorways}in the country and will run 
 all all around London itself. Green   
 Line and London Transport{buses}pass  
 on the A217.                          
    By{rail,}Kingswood Station (just to
 the north of our area) is the closest 
 and provides services to London at    
 approximately twenty minute intervals 
 during the rush hour. The large       
 numbers of people commuting to London 
 each day prefer rail, since the       
 journey into London can be made in    
 about half an hour.                   
    Two main{airports:}Heathrow and    
 Gatwick are also within easy reach.
