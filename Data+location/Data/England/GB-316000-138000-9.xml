		<content> The village has had its own  post     
 office for many years. It is now part 
 of the Spar Grocery Shop. Their main  
 business is of postal services for    
 letters and parcels, but they also    
 deal with motor vehicle and television
 licences and pensions. No postal      
 deliveries or collections are made by 
 this post office. These services are  
 run by the main sorting office at     
 Bridgwater. About twelve postmen cover
 this area in shifts, driving red post 
 office vans. There are two postal     
 collections and deliveries for most of
 the village on weekdays, one on       
 Saturday. The new housing estate only 
 receives one delivery daily.          
 Approximately 80% of homes have a     
 telephone and many have a second      
 telephone. The pushbutton telephone is
 becoming popular. Bridgwater is our   
 local exchange.                       </content>
