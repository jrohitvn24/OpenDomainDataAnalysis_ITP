		<title>08A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I have lived in Dunstable all my life 
 and can't remember it to be to        
 different from today. It is not a very
 fast growing town due to the fact that
 there are not many new jobs or        
 factories.                            
   A typical day without school would  
 consist of me getting up around ten   
 o'clock and going to see my friends.  
 Sometimes we may journey to Luton on  
 the bus to "doss" around the shops in 
 the Arndale Centre or we may go to the
 video shop to hire a film. We may even
 watch a decent film at the cinema in  
 Luton.                                
   Dunstable is not a very lively town 
 so most people would journey to Luton 
 for the night clubs or discos.        
 Dunstable is a pretty usual boring    
 small town, but is also quiet and has 
 near housingin most places.
