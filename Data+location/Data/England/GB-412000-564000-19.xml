		<title>19DAY OF A SCHOOL SECRETARY.</title>
		<content>    Mrs Walton is the school secretary 
 at Throckley First School, she gets up
 at 7 a.m. and has cornflakes and      
 grapefruit for breakfast. She leaves  
 home at 8.15 a.m. She gets to school  
 at 8.25 a.m. and when she gets to     
 school she opens the filing cabinet.  
 She has a coffee break and she has her
 dinner at school.                     
    She likes all of her jobs and she  
 goes home at 4 p.m. Mrs Walton likes  
 bacon for her tea and she likes to    
 watch "Songs of Praise" on television.
 Her hobbies are local history and     
 craft work and she goes to bed at 11  
 p.m. She likes being a secretary      
 very much, especially a school        
 secretary because she sees children   
 every day.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
