		<title>07Upottery's Amenities 1</title>
		<content> When we surveyed our 12 square km.    
 grid area we found that most of the   
 land is used for agriculture and we   
 have few of the amenities which other 
 areas might have.                     
 Most of the amenities are in Upottery 
 and Rawridge such as the pub in       
 Upottery where you can drink or eat.  
 There was once a coaching inn called  
{The Devonshire Inn}on the{A303 road   
 but it is now  a farm and has been    
 since before 1900.                    
 There is a building called{The Manor  
{Room}which is used for dances ,whist  
 drives and all sorts of things.       
 Sometimes we perform our school plays 
 there. At the side of it is a tennis  
 court and an area of land where the   
 village fete is held.It is also used  
 as a cricket ground.
