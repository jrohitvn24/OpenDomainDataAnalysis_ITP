		<title>03The Village of Easton.</title>
		<content>   There are approximately 125-130     
{houses and cottages}in the village and
 most of them date back to 1900-1980,  
 although some are much older. Most of 
 the{cottages}have beautiful thatched  
 roofs with figures carved out. These  
 were once{farm labourers cottages}but 
 are now expensive private dwellings.  
 One we particularly took notice of was
 a white and black house with a peacock
 and fish carved on the top. Most of   
 the houses had{gardens}some of which  
 are quite large. There are four       
 streets in{Easton}all meeting at the  
 cross-roads. We saw that there were   
 two or three{G.P.O.post boxes}and the 
 collections are at 09.45am. and later 
 on at 16.15pm. There is a{bus service 
 twice a week. It is a very pretty     
 village indeed.
