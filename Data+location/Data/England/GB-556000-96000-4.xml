		<title>04Landscape of the Downs</title>
		<content>    The most striking feature of the   
 Downs is that there are extremely few 
 plants above six feet in height. This 
 is due to both the high winds and the 
 thin layer of soil above the          
 underlying chalk. As trees need firm, 
 deep roots if they are to grow high,  
 the six to twelve inches of topsoil   
 does not suffice - especially in the  
 strong winds that occur on the        
 unprotected slopes above the cliffs.  
    As a result of these conditions, a 
 large proportion of the ground is bare
 and, where it is covered, the scrub is
 very low. This has the effect of      
 enabling one to see far over the Downs
 in each direction. The Downs          
 themselves are smooth and there are no
 steep slopes apart from the cliffs.   
 Their height is between 400 &amp; 500     
 feet - no further building is allowed 
 above 300 feet.                       </content>
