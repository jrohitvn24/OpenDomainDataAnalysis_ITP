		<content>{Windsurfing}is very popular in the    
 Weymouth area.{Overcombe Beach        
{(36950816)}provides ideal conditions  
 for light wind course racing to high  
 wind funboarding. Weymouth has a      
 boardsailing club, which currently has
 62 members, and this is based at      
 Overcombe. One of the local wind-     
 surfers, Dave Perks, represented      
 Britain in the 1984 Olympic Games.    
 There is only one drawback to wind-   
 surfing and that is the presence      
 of a reef (a legacy of a previous     
 coastal protection scheme) just       
 offshore.                             
  There is parking nearby and a snack  
 bar serving refreshments. In the      
 Summer the beach is crowded with all  
 sorts of holidaymakers and areas have 
 been allocated to windsurfers to      
 lessen the risk of collisions.
