		<title>19Conkers and Marbles</title>
		<content>This page describes two playground     
games that we play at West Haddon      
School. Conkers is a game played in the
autumn and marbles in the summer. A    
conker is a nut from a horse chestnut  
tree. Two people play conkers. One     
person holds his conker out so that it 
hs down from a string, while the other 
player hits it with his conker. If he  
misses they swap roles.The game ends   
when a conker breaks.                  
A marble is a small glass ball with a  
wiggly pattern in it. We use a hole    
about 6cm wide. You roll your marble to
get it in the hole. If you miss and the
next person gets it in, he has to get  
in the marble that you rolled. If he   
gets your marble in the hole as well he
wins.
