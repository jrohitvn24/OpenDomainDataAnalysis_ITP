		<content>  MY NAME IS AMANDA AND I AM 8 YEARS   
 OLD. IN THE  MORNING I GET UP AND HAVE
 BREAKFAST .THEN I GO INTO THE GARDEN  
 AND WALK IN THE GREENHOUSE AND SEE THE
 DUCKS. MUM SAYS," COMING WITH ME TO   
 WATER THE BULLOCKS?"                  
 I SAY,"YES" AND WE GO AND SEE THEM AND
 SAY HELLO TO BLACKIE THE HORSE.I LIKE 
 HORSE RIDING SO IN THE AFTERNOON I    
 RIDE HIM. AFTER THAT I HAVE TEA.      
 SOMETIMES WE HAVE SANDWICHES OR A     
 COOKED MEAL, NORMALLY A COOKED MEAL.  
 THEN I GO OUT AND PLAY. SOON IT IS    
 TIME FOR MY SISTER EMMA TO GO TO      
 BED AND I GO WITH DADDY TO SEE THE    
 BULLOCKS, LITTLE CHICKS AND BLACKIE.  
 THEN I GO TO BED AS WELL.
