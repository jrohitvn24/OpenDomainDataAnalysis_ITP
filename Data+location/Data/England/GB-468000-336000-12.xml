		<title>12WORSHIP AT CROPWELL BUTLER</title>
		<content> We used to have one special preacher  
 for the{Anniversary Service}at        
 Cropwell Butler, but now we have a    
 concert party, a band, a singer or a  
 musical evening. We have a wonderful  
 candle-lit{Christmas Eve Service.}The 
{Sunday School}children perform a      
 Nativity play as we sing our carols.  
 To many people this really is their   
 Christmas. Our joiner made the stable 
 and crib with lantern. Lights are     
 strung on the fir tree outside the    
 Church and truly the Spirit of        
 Christmas prevails. People love to    
 come and meet their friends - it must 
 bear such an influence on Village     
 life. In July we had a{'Womens Work'  
 meeting &amp; ladies came from all over   
 the circuit. The Church &amp; tea-tables  
 were beautifully decorated with roses,
 and lovely refreshments were provided.
