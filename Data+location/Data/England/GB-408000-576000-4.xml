		<content>  We have talked to 3 people who used  
 to go to our school and they were all 
 over{70 years old.                    
{ Miss Snowball's family}have lived in 
 Belsay for 150 years and she used to  
 walk to Belsay School with her        
 brother                               
{ Mrs. Bowman and Mr. Wake}lived 3     
 miles away and they walked to school  
 although they sometimes got a lift on 
 the local farmer's milk cart. Mr. Wake
 could remember the boys carrying their
 boots and walking in bare feet to save
 shoe leather. Sometimes they rinsed   
 their feet in the stream so that the  
 tar wouldn't stick to.them.           
{  Sir Arthur Middleton}built the      
 school with very high ceilings because
 he liked the children to have plenty  
 of fresh air and wanted them to       
 breathe deeply.
