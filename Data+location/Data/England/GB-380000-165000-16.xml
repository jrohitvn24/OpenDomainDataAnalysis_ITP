		<content>   Some time ago there was a{tram      
{line}carrying{stone}from Monkton      
 Farleigh mines to the Bath to London  
{railway line}near Box Bridge.There was
 a{toll house}near{The Old Jockey}at   
 Kingsdown because the London to Bath  
 road went over Kingsdown.The{main     
{roads}in our area are Bath-London (A4)
 and Box-Melksham,(A365).We have one   
 "B" road in our area,and that is      
 Corsham-Bradford (B3109).We have one  
{main railway line}in our area,this is 
 on the north west side.It goes from   
 Bath to London.The one line of{pylons 
 we have goes east to west over        
{farmland}at Kingsdown and follows some
 of the ancient Roman Road.The{oil pipe
{lines}from Fawley in Southampton to   
 South Wales also lie under farmland.  
 There are 7{bus journeys}a week       
 through Monkton carrying children to  
 school and adults to Bath.            </content>
