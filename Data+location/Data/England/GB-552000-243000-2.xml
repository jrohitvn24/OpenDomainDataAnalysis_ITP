		<title>02Hadstock Village Shop</title>
		<content> The village shop is a sub-Post Office 
 and general stores.  It sells         
 groceries, sweets and cigarettes,     
 household goods and stationery.       
    The post for the people in Hadstock
 doesn't come to the Post Office in the
 village.  It's delivered from Linton. 
    The owners have been running the   
 shop about five years, but the shop is
 eight or nine years old.  They live in
 a house next door to the shop.  It is 
 the only shop in Hadstock, but there  
 are mobile shops too (vans that come  
 round selling various goods).         
    They think it is a good way of     
 making a living, and they hope that it
 will last much longer.
