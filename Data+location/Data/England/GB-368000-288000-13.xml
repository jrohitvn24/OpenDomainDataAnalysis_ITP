		<title>13HEDGEROWS IN SHROPSHIRE</title>
		<content>     There are many wonderful things   
 hidden in the overgrown{hedgerows.}In 
 spring many wild flowers can be seen, 
 such as{stitchwort,dog violet, dead   
{nettle, ground ivy}and many others.The
 hedges are mainly hawthorn and hazel  
 with patches of holly and brambles.In 
 the late spring and summer, they      
 become overgrown; most hedges are     
 cut in late summer after harvest.     
                                       
  The hedges are home to many  animals 
 and birds.The{small tortoiseshell     
 butterfly lays her eggs on the nettles
 and is often seen there.We often see  
 holes in the  hedge where foxes have  
 made paths. Shropshire hedgerows are  
 very interesting.{Why don't you       
{explore them ?
