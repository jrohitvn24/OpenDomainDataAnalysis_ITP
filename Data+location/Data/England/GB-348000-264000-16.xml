		<title>16ST.GEORGE'S CHURCH (CONT.)</title>
		<content> We do know that they are the{Apostles 
 though because one is St. Peter       
 holding some keys.Perhaps the         
 sculptors ran out of room and couldn't
 fit the other three on. One of the    
{stained glass windows}has a clock in  
 it and when the sun shines through it 
 you can see the time. But it only     
 shows the hours from one to seven.    
 The pulpit is a fine example of       
{Jacobean}woodwork.On one wall there is
 a picture of a king painted and the   
 crown he is wearing is painted with   
 real gold! It is{Edward II.}There is  
 also a painting of his wife{Queen     
{Isabella}who fell in love with{Roger  
{Mortimer of Wigmore Castle.}This      
 started the{War of the Roses.         
 There is a fourteenth century         
{preaching cross}in the churchyard.The 
 church has a{weather dragon}instead of
 a weather cock because of{St. George. </content>
