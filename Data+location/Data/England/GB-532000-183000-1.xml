		<title>01AN INTRODUCTION TO THE BLOCK</title>
		<content>   Our 12km square block covers the    
eastern part of Islington and quite a  
big area of Hackney.They are both Inner
London boroughs north of the Thames.In 
1981 Islington's population was 160,890
(a decrease of 20% from 1971).Hackney's
was 180,434 (down 18%).Both are densely
populated,well over twice the London   
average of 43 people per hectare.The   
two are both poorly off for open space.
Islington (0.3ha.per 1,000) and Hackney
(1.5ha) have much less than other parts
of London.The block has a typical inner
city town-scape with a mixture of old  
and new,high and low rise housing.Both 
suffer from housing shortage.Islington 
in parts,has been gentrified especially
the old squares.There is a great mix of
ethnic groupings with 1/4 of the people
born outside the U.K.Unemployment is   
high especially amongst the young.
