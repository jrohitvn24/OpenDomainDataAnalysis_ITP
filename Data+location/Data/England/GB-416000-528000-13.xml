		<title>13BISHOP BARRINGTON COMP. SCH.</title>
		<content> The Bishop Barrington was one of the  
 higher clergy in the Georgian Period. 
 He was a personal friend of GeorgeIII.
 He came to Durham in 1791 as Bishop,  
 one of the richest appointments in    
 England.                              
    The original Barrington School was 
 built in 1810 on a site known as      
 Pollard's Hall on the South side of   
 the Market Place where it remained    
 until July 1974. At its foundation    
 Children were admitted from the age of
 four or five until they could read and
 write.  The hours were 8am to 5pm in  
 Winter, 8am to 7pm in Summer and      
 Masters were paid Â£120 a year.        
    The present comprehensive school   
 was formed from the amalgamation of   
 Vinovium Secondary School, at Etherley
 Dene, and Woodhouse Close Secondary   
 School.  Now further 'rationalisation'
 is anticipated due to falling rolls.  </content>
