  You need at least 6 people.Someone is
chosen as Â£it'and has to run around to 
try to catch the other people.The      
corners of the playground are called   
Â£home'and you cannot be caught in      
them.If you are caught you have to     
stand still with your arms out.Someone 
who has not been caught can free you by
touching you.The game goes on until    
there is just one person left.That     
person becomes Â£it' and the game starts
again.                                 
      LEAP FROG.                       
  You need two or more players.One
