		<title>10TENNIS IN ENCHMARSH,SHROPS.</title>
		<content>                                       
    I married a farmer 20 years ago and
 came to live in Enchmarsh. I began    
 playing tennis at 8 on a grass court  
 specially built by my parents. As     
 there was no local qualified coach,I  
 travelled every Saturday for a half-  
 hour lesson costing 10/6d.--old money.
 I have completed 25 years playing for 
 Shropshire Ladies and took over as    
 Captain 6 years ago.                  
    Living in a rural area is a        
 disadvantage as I have to travel 28   
 miles to my club in Shrewsbury. In the
 winter I travel 50 miles to play at   
 the newly opened indoor courts at     
 Telford. Court hire here is Â£6 per    
 hour, and with petrol at Â£2 per       
 gallon, tennis is no longer a cheap   
 sport.
