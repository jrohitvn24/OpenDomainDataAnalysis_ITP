		<title>16CHURCHES IN SPALDWICK</title>
		<content> There are three places of worship in  
 Spaldwick.The parish church which is  
 Church of England,Baptist Church and  
 meeting house for Christian Brethren. 
 On the site of the present meeting    
 house,there has been a place of       
 worship at Spaldwick for over one     
 hundred years.The original building   
 was an old school room and the        
 meetings were started by a school     
 master under the guidance of a        
 Christian man,Mr.J.N.Darby from       
 Ireland(where he was a minister of the
 Church of England but gave up this    
 living to be more devoted to          
 God).There is no minister and today   
 about one dozen people from the       
 surrounding area gather together to   
 attend various meetings.There is no   
 altar,pulpit or organ in the building 
 and no artistic decoration.
