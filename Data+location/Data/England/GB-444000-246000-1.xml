		<title>01Cropredy Area</title>
		<content>It is a rural area with Cropredy       
village at the centre. It is situated  
in the Cherwell Valley. The River      
Cherwell runs through the village.     
 There is a large farming community    
which is long established.Cropredy is  
written in the original Doomsday book  
as Cropelie belonging to the Bishop of 
Lincoln, as was much of the surrounding
area.                                  
 When the canal came through in the    
1790's the area around the canal grew. 
 The railway runs through the village  
but no longer stops as there is        
no longer any station. Station Road  is
all that survives.                     
 Cropredy's main claim to fame in      
history is that it is the site of a    
major battle in the Civil War, the     
Battle of Cropredy Bridge, in 1645.
