		<content>   Tansor is a small linear settlement 
 two miles north-east of{Oundle}       
 surrounded by arable farm-land with   
 grass and wheat most prominent in July
 1985. The village has a population of 
 151 according to the East             
 Northamptonshire District Council     
 handbook produced in 1983. There are  
 virtually no amenities in the village 
 with no pub, post-office or shop.     
 One bus each way each day &lt;no.323>    
 joins Tansor, Oundle and Peterborough.
 The main features of the village      
 include the church of St.Mary which is
 thought to date from the eleventh     
 century, although parts of the east   
 aisle date from as late as the        
 fourteenth century. The magnificent   
 building of Tansor Court dominates the
 northern edge from where the          
 neighbouring village of Cotterstock   
 can be seen.                          </content>
