		<title>14THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The{village school}does not have      
 sufficient space to present{school    
{plays and concerts.}The Lambeague     
 Hall, with its stage, changing room   
 and seating capacity, provides ideally
 for the needs of the children, and in 
 recent years the{school Christmas     
{concert or nativity play}has been     
 presented there.                      
 Another annual function which takes   
 place in the hall is the{Senior       
{Citizens' Christmas Dinner.}The       
 members of the committee organising   
 this event suitably decorate the      
 hall, prepare the food and provide    
 entertainment for the afternoon for   
 all the pensionable residents of the  
 area. Occasionally the children from  
 Coverack School are invited to provide
 the entertainment for this very       
 worthwhile and much appreciated event.
