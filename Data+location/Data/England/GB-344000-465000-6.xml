		<title>06The Shore-Hest Bank.</title>
		<content>The shore at Hest Bank is split up     
into  two parts.There is sand far out  
so when the tide comes in it is all    
covered.Then near the shore there are  
gullies and grassy banks.The tide      
covers the gullies but the grassy banks
are above high tide level.There is a   
channel that is very wide and it flows 
towards the sea.It is called Hatlex    
Beck.The tides around Hest Bank are    
very dangerous.When the tide is out you
can go across Morecambe Bay with a     
guide,but there is sinking sand and the
tide comes in very quickly round you so
you can get trapped.The birds around   
Morecambe Bay come from many countries 
in the north to feed on the sea life   
left behind when the tide goes         
out.These birds include Redshank,Gulls 
and many waders.
