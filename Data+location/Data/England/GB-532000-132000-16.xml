		<title>16EXPLORING THE SELSFIELD AREA</title>
		<content> Many well-signposted footpaths provide
 a variety of walks, crossing farmlands
 and woods, sometimes with extensive   
 views. The path opposite{Selsfield    
{Common,}across undulating farmland to 
{Little Strudgate Farm,}gives fine     
 views of the{South Downs}and          
{Chanctonbury Ring.}At{Great Strudgate 
{Farm}a path branches off to pass{Old  
{House,}formerly{Fieldwyck,}where the  
 family of that name lived for many    
 centuries. The registered herd of     
{Guernsey}cows bears the name{Feldwick.
 On the opposite side of the road is   
 the{White Hart Inn,}an attractive half
 timbered coaching inn beside the      
 former turnpike, dating from the 14th 
 century. It was a hunting lodge for   
{John of Gaunt.}Today it provides good 
 food as well as drink.
