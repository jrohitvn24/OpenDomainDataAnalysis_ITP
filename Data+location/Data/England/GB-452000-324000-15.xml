		<title>15HOUSING IN EAST LEAKE</title>
		<content> Because the village has grown         
 considerably in recent years,much of  
 the housing is modern.                
 Some building took place just after   
 the second world war,but the majority 
 of the extra houses were completed in 
 the 1970's.It was then that three     
 estates were completed.The 'Tree      
 Estate(so called because each         
 road,close,or avenue is named after a 
 tree)is the largest.The houses vary in
 size but none are very large and for  
 many of the inhabitants it is their   
 first house.                          
 Bateman Road and the closes which lead
 off it is the second largest.Each     
 close is named after a Cathedral      
 City.The houses contain many young    
 families.                             
 Manor Farm Meadow is smaller,the      
 houses are larger.There are other     
 smaller developments in the village.  </content>
