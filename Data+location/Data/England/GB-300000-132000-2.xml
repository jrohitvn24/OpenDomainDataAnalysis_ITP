		<title>02GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area consists of a flat plateau   
 rising to 377m near Brendon Hill,     
 virtually the whole area being over   
 300m high although there are a few    
 small valleys.                        
 The roads are narrow and edged with   
 the traditional Devon banks - high    
 banks of soil sometimes with beech    
 trees growing in them.                
 The fields are mostly small and these 
 are also edged with beech although the
 exposed nature of the area means that 
 these trees are usually small.        
 There are no villages and the only    
 occupation other than farming is in   
 the running of a small camp site      
 and caravan club park near Duns stone 
 in the summer.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
