		<content>   Mummy wanted a large malt crunch    
 loaf costing 56p from the baker. She  
 gave me the money and a parcel to     
 post. When I got back I helped Daddy  
 clear the yard, stacking tiles and    
 tidying up.                           
   We had lunch quickly _ chicken pie, 
 rhubarb and custard _ as we were off  
 to our School Summer Fayre.We were    
 there all afternoon and raised about  
 Â£20 on our skittles stall. Meanwhile  
 Daddy went home to shear the sheep.   
   When we got home we had tea and did 
 the chickens _ fed them with mash and 
 collected their eggs. We called the   
 goats in and milked them. Then I went 
 to bed after a nice hot bath.
