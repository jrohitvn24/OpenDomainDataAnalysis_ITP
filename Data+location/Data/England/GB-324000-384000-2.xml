   In linky you need about ten people  
 to play. You all get into a circle and
 link little fingers and one person    
 says "I linky everybody keep away from
 ......" and says the name of someone. 
 Then everybody runs away and the      
 person whose name was called out, trys
 to catch the others. When she does,   
 she links with that person. When they 
 have four linked up, they split in two
 and so on until they are all caught.
