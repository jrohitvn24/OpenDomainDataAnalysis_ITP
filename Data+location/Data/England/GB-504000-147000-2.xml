   Shere village and nearby Gomshall   
 are both recorded in the first        
 Domesday book. In 1086 Shere was known
 as ESSIRA a Saxon village with a      
 church and some thirty families.      
 Gomshall was known as GOMESELE with   
 over forty families. Together there   
 was a population of about 200 people. 
   Shere was very much a farming       
 community in those early days. In 1985
 the villages of Shere and Gomshsll    
 share a population  of around 5000    
 people. Shere is certainly a centre   
 for visitors,it is a considerable     
 tourist attraction throughout the     
 year. It is a lively picturesque      
 village with its shops and inns full  
 of local life, with Tillingbourne     
 stream making an idyllic setting.     
 Gomshall around the mill makes a      
 favourite tourist attraction in 1985. </content>
