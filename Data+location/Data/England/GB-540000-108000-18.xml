		<title>18   SHOPPING  IN  LEWES</title>
		<content>      Antique shops represent 20% of   
 non-food shops in historic Lewes. Cul-
 verwells, Harper &amp; Eede's, Curtis &amp; Co
 and Stevensons have supplied local    
 farmers for many years from thjis     
 market town.                          
      Many Lewesians go to Brighton or 
 Eastbourne for clothes and shoes, but 
 you can buy these here in small shops.
     Safeway's Foodstore opened in l982
 employing l37, serving 25000 shoppers 
 a week,competing with other foodshops 
 It is quite a meetingplace for Lewes, 
 including Boot Sales in its carpark.  
      Cliffe High Street may become a  
 pedestrian precinct, and shops are    
 optimistically opening on the Odeon   
 site at its eastern end. Railway Land 
 development will strengthen the shop- 
 ping pull of this end of Lewes. More  
 High Street shops may move downhill   
 to the lower end of Lewes as a result.</content>
