		<title>13ELECTRICITY SUB-STATION</title>
		<content> In 1970 the Central Electricity       
 Generating Board bought 75 acres of   
 land,and used 10 acres for an elec-   
 tricity substation.It consists of cir-
 cuits,switches,transformers and auxi- 
 lary plant buildings,and is connected 
 to the National Grid.It does not pro- 
 duce electricity, but controls it.It  
 is operated from a control room at    
 Watford,but every Spring men come and 
 clear away birds nests etc.The land   
 was originally covered in trees in the
 middle of Shardeloes game reserve.The 
 shooting rights were bought,and the   
 site has been turned into a nature    
 reserve.The trees were cut down,and   
 hundreds of tons of soil were removed 
 to make a hollow.In 1975 dozens of    
 new pylons were erected and a cable   
 buried.Â£8,000 was spent on trees and  
 grass_but they all died in the 1976   
 drought and had to be replaced.       </content>
