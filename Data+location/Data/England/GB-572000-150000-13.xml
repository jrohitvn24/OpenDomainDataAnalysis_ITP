		<title>13Fruit Farming in Coxheath</title>
		<content> The majority of farming in this area  
 is fruit farming, mainly apples; both 
 cooking and eating.  There are also   
 soft fruits.  Casual labour is        
 employed for picking.  Originally     
 there were many small farms but now   
 most of the orchards are owned by a   
 few large farms; houses and buildings 
 having been sold off with a small plot
 of land.                              
                                       
 Some of the orchards are irrigated    
 from specially constructed reservoirs.
 In one large orchard, grafting has    
 been done as the root stock is still  
 good.  Another large orchard has had  
 the ground sprayed.  This has killed  
 all life on the ground and drift to   
 the hedgerows has also resulted in the
 death of wild plants.  We asked       
 ourselves if this will lead to the    
 creation of a dustbowl in Coxheath.   </content>
