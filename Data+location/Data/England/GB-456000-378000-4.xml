		<title>04THE NEWSAGENT</title>
		<content> The second shop that we visited was   
 Martins the newsagents. The owner was 
 called Mr. Martin and he has had his  
 shop for eight years. His day begins  
 at 5.30am. when he receives the day's 
 papers, which are delivered from      
 Sheffield. Three people count the     
 papers and set up the rounds. On their
 rounds the paper boys cover one to    
 four kilometres and make 45 to 50     
 deliveries. Papers and magazines are  
 the main bulk of the business. The    
 most expensive items for sale are     
 toys. The busiest periods are         
 Christmas, Easter and Mother's Day.   
 The shop is open from 6.30am. to      
 5.30pm on weekdays and from 7.30am to 
 1.00pm on Sundays when they are only  
 allowed to sell newspapers,tobacco and
 confectionary. Six part-time staff and
 the owner's wife are employed to serve
 the 800 to 900 daily customers.       </content>
