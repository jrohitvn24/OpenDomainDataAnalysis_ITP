		<title>14INTERVIEW WITH MRS MARTIN</title>
		<content> We visited Mrs Martin to ask her about
 the way the villages of Trispen and St
 Erme had changed since she came to    
 live in the district.She has lived    
 here for over 30 years.               
  She could rember when the vicar lived
 in the rectory near the church.The    
 present vicar is part of a team       
 covering Probus, Ladock,Grampound Road
 and Grampound.He lives in the new     
 estate which has been developed       
 between the two villages and has made 
 them one residential area.She does not
 think the estate has improved the     
 district.She also wishes the people   
 who have come to live in the area     
 would join in with more of the local  
 activities.Only a few have joined in  
 with the many clubs and societies.
