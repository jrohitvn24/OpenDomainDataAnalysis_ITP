		<title>05Broadoak Quarry</title>
		<content> This quarry has been in existance for 
 35 years.It employs 11 people         
 permanently and x number of lorry     
 drivers depending on the demand for   
 sand and gravel.                      
      The raw materials are shovelled  
 from the quarry face into dumper      
 trucks,taken to a hopper and separated
 into sand and stone.The sand is washed
 and taken on an escalator to be       
 transferred onto wagons.The stone is  
 crushed into gravel and stored for    
 deliveries.The water for washing is   
 circulated from a stream.It is pumped 
 to the plant,used,fed into a          
 pond,filtered into a reservoir and    
 feeds back into the stream.Trout are  
 stocked and fished.                   
       The quarry policy is to restore 
 the land to its original condition.
