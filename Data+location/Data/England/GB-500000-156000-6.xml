   Burhill Estates is a land           
 development company which owns a large
 amount of land around Pyrford. When   
 Lord Iveagh of the Guiness family died
 in 1968, the land was sold to Burhill 
 estates but the Guiness family still  
 have shares in the company. Most of   
 the land is farmland but some has been
 developed as can be seen in the case  
 of{Hoebridge Golf Centre}(1980). Other
 land is leased to two farms:{Lady     
{Place Farm}-used for livestock and{   
{Roundbridge Farm}-an arable share farm
 growing barely wheat and oats. Estate 
 accomodation is inhabited by employees
 of Burhill Estates. There are no      
 immediate plans for future development
 of this grade 3 farm land.
