		<content> Mining the major industry of our      
 area , has been having problems over  
 the past year, with the year long     
 strike sapping the savings of the     
 miners, leaving many bankrupt.  Not   
 all pits are working, with Heigate    
 colliery closing.  Luckily most of the
 places were taken up by voluntary     
 redundancy, and transfer to the mine  
 on the same seam - Goldthorpe, which  
 is thought to have approximately five 
 years of further working life.
