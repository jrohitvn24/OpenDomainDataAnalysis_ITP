American owned. It employs over 150,000
people throughout the world. This      
factory in Bushbury stretches over 100 
acres of land surrounded by Stafford

 Over 3,500 people work here and it is

 Goodyears make tyres, pliofilm (for   
packaging) and many other items which  
benefit millions of consumers. They can
make a tyre for any kind of vehicle.   
Tyres are exported worldwide, some     
being made especially for racing cars. 
 To help promote the company Goodyears 
have an airship that travels all over
