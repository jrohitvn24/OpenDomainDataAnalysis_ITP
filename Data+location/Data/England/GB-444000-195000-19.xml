   In Marcham there are two pubs and an
Ex-servicemen's Club. The pubs are the 
Crown and the White Hart.              
   In the Crown you can play Aunt Sally
and darts. In the White Horse you can  
play darts and get a meal.             
   In the Ex-servicemen's Club you can 
play Aunt Sally and darts. The people  
who work in the Ex-servicemen's Club   
do it in their free time. You have to  
be a member to use it.                 
   The Ex-servicemen's Club puts on    
parties for children at Christmas      
and gives social evenings to old       
people.
