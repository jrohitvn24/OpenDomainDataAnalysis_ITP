		<title>13THE GRANGE MUSEUM NEASDEN</title>
		<content>{The Grange Museum}is our local museum.
 It is situated in the middle of a busy
 roundabout only accessible by bridge. 
 It is not used very much. Old people  
 use it because they like to see things
 that they remember from when they were
 young and because it helps them pass  
 the time.Lots of local schools use it 
 to find out about local history.If the
 museum was made bigger, it would be   
 easier to get around inside.We thought
 the most interesting thing was the    
{marble table}in the entrance hall.The 
 marble came from all over the world   
 and had interesting patterns in it.   
 If we made posters and stuck them     
 on lamp-posts and windows more people 
 would know that we have a good museum 
 in Neasden.We could even send up a    
 giant air balloon saying:-
