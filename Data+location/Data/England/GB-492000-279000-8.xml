		<title>08  Life in Grafton Underwood</title>
		<content>cont'd                                 
  One resident in Grafton Underwood is 
Mr C. Oglethorpe who until July 1985   
was the head teacher of Millbrook      
Junior School in Kettering. He lives in
School House on the west side of the   
village street. He has lived there     
since 1970 and has seen town people    
move into the village and village      
people move out. On Saturdays when he  
is not at school he rises at 07.30 and 
at 08.30 he watches the cows go by on  
their way to be milked. In Summer he   
plays tennis on his friends court from 
10.00 until 12.00 and then eats. He may
spend his afternoon gardening and from 
22.00 may visit the 'Samuel Pepys' pub 
in Slipton. He is very happy living in 
Grafton Underwood and if he didn't     
live there he would probably like to   
live in Geddington.
