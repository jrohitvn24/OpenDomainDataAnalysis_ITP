		<title>09FAMILY LIFE - ONE FAMILY.</title>
		<content>   Every day I get up and go to school.
  The weekdays atmosphere is normal.   
 Our family has got a shop.  We sell a 
 lot of things such as groceries and   
 alcohol.                              
  The reasons why we bought a shop was 
 because there is a lot of unemployment
 around in England at this point in    
 time. There is also a lot of crime and
 violence. I think that is because of  
 unemployment.  In our shop we keep a  
 good eye on people that come into our 
 shop.                                 
   Sometimes I have nothing to do, then
 I watch T.V. or work on the till.     
 Sometimes we go out and eat pizzas.   
   My favourite sports are Football,   
 Cricket,Badminton, Pool and Snooker.
