 Our area is mostly{arable farmland,   
 growing cereals, oil seed rape, sugar 
 beet and potatoes. The land is very   
{flat}and drained by dykes and a man_  
 made channel, The Maxey Cut.          
  There are two major villages,{Maxey  
 (pop.650) and{Northborough}(pop.1200),
 and one hamlet,{Etton}(pop.90).       
 Peterborough is the nearest large     
 town, about 8 miles south of our area.
 The A15 goes through our area cutting 
 between Northborough and Maxey. Both  
 Nothborough and Maxey have a general  
 shop with a post office but only      
 Northborough has a primary school.    
 Children from Maxey travel to         
 Northborough by school bus each day,  
 while the older children from each    
 village are bussed to the local       
 comprehensive school at Glinton.      
 This is just to the south of our area.</content>
