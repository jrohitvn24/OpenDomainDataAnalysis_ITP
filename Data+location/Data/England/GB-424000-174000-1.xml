		<content> This is an Area of Outstanding Natural
 Beauty, mostly in the Parish of       
 Aldbourne which extends west and north
 of the area. The village occupies     
 about one twelth of the area where two
 dry valleys join to form the perennial
 Ald brook, flowing south to the       
 Kennet. In the south east the height  
 is about 400m rising to nearly 700m   
 towards Upham at the opposite corner. 
 Most of the area outside the village  
 is farmed producing barley and sheep, 
 with some dairying and stock. Hedges  
 and trees mark the clays to the south,
 but the chalk downs to the north      
 have been virtually treeless from     
 Prehistoric times. Farming employs few
 people and much machinery, so that    
 many have to find employment in the   
 modern industries and offices in      
 Swindon. There is still a wide range  
 of services and shops in the village  </content>
