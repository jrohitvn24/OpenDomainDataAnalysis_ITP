		<title>11LANDSCAPE OF CHERINGTON</title>
		<content> Geology, relief and drainage were the 
 three elements of landscape           
 considered.  Our area's geology       
 belongs to the Jurassic Era.  Then,   
 millions of years ago, in a sea       
 covering this part of Britain, the    
 rocks of the Cotswold area were laid  
 down.  These rocks were the Great     
 Oolite, a white/grey limestone and    
 Forest Marble a more shelly, creamy   
 limestone. The relief of the area     
 originates in the Miocene when the    
 Cotswolds were uplifted to form an    
 escarpment.  Our area forms part of   
 the dip slope with land falling from  
 170m at Hampton Fields, to the        
 south-east at an overall gradient of  
 1:50.  The area is cut by two valleys,
 one a dry valley of glacial  origins  
 to the north of Cherington.  The other
 valley, with a stream flowing west    
 is responsible for the area's drainage</content>
