		<title>15PADBURY &amp; HILLESDEN PATHWAYS</title>
		<content> Within our area are many public foot- 
 paths and bridleways. Some are well   
 used others almost lost. Some are very
 old, indeed the origin of the name    
 Padbury is said to be from 'pad' or   
 'pack', a narrow path used by pack    
 horses, and 'bury' meaning a mound or 
 burgh. One pathway, now made difficult
 to use, follows the 'back lane' of the
 Anglo Saxon centre of the village.    
 Other footpaths link with nearby      
 settlements more directly than do     
 modern roads. This applies especially 
 to paths between Padbury and Hillesden
 about three and a half miles apart by 
 footpath and five and a half by road. 
 Sometimes paths converge at obvious   
 places like a river crossing or farm  
 but sometimes as many as 5 or 6 paths 
 meet at what is now just a corner of a
 field.
