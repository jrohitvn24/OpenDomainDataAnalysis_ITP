		<content> MARSDEN QUARRY.                       
 Quarrying is an old industry in the   
 Marsden district.Layers of various    
 limestones were formed from the       
 compression of sands and mud deposited
 under the sea.                        
 The present quarry is about ninety    
 years old and is owned by the Tilcon  
 company. Every year six hundred       
 thousand tons of dolomitic limestone  
 is quarried by blasting. The quarry   
 uses static and mobile machinery to   
 produce limestone for use in road     
 construction, agriculture, fire       
 prevention, glass and steel           
 industries.                           
 The limestone is exported to Japan,the
 West Indies, and many European        
 countries. .                          
 There is enough limestone to extend   
 the quarry but local residents and    
 conservation groups oppose it.        </content>
