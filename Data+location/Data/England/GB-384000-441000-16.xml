		<title>16WHITEMOOR RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> Before the dam was constructed the    
 area now under water was very boggy   
 with 3 small streams/springs meeting  
 to form a larger stream called {County
{Brook,}this being the original        
{Lancashire - Yorkshire Border.}The    
 vitrified stumps of large trees can be
 seen today in late summer when the    
 water level has fallen. The reservoir 
 was constructed by 1840 to store water
 for controlled release through sluices
 into County Brook and then into the   
 canal to compensate for large traffic 
 through the locks at{Barnoldswick}one 
 side and the 7 locks at{Barrowford}on 
 the other. The locks at Barrowford    
 drop the canal over 33 feet, the      
 largest change in level over the whole
 canal, hence the need fer 6 local     
 reservoirs to hold a good head of     
 water for the dry periods of summer.
