		<title>07Great Shelford</title>
		<content>  Great Shelford appeared to be quite a
 rich village. We came to this         
 conclusion through the questionaires  
 which had shown that most people had  
 either retired or were still working. 
 Nobody we spoke to was unemployed and 
 as it was a monday most people would  
 have been at work.                    
  On the outskirts by the farms, we saw
 many fields: wheat was the main crop. 
  {Transport}was quite busy and by the 
 Great Shelford post office there were 
 a lot of cars followed by lorries and 
 frequent buses going into Cambridge.  
  The{railway}line to London (Liverpool
 Street) ran throungh the centre of the
 village and the station stayed open   
 till 1 am (not popular with the       
 local villagers who complained of the 
 noise). Just before Shelford, the line
 to Royston branches off carrying      
 little diesel 'bus-trains'.           </content>
