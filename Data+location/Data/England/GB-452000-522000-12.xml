		<title>12HEALTH/SAFETY ON SEAL SANDS</title>
		<content> All companies on Sealands have their  
 own fire services but are all linked  
 together and to the County Fire       
 Brigade.  {(However, 99% of fires are 
{put out before the fire brigade       
{arrives!)} The fire services on each  
 site have two men working per shift   
 who are full-time firemen and they are
 backed up by other members of the     
 plant, e.g. laboratory personell.     
 They are also members of the Seal     
 Sands Toxic Fire Release Plan, which  
 means that they must notify each other
 if there are any toxic gas leakages so
 that evacuation measures can be taken.
  Fire-fighting training takes place on
 all sites and the length of training  
 depends on the job.                   
 Every employee is trained in First Aid
 but the emergency services are shared 
 and they all have close links with    
 the local hospital.                   </content>
