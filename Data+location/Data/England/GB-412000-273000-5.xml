		<content> St.Patrick's C of E School was opened 
 in 1816 with only two classes and     
 forty children. We have had many      
 changes over the years, one of which  
 was an assembly hall with a kitchen.  
 Now we have Four classes and 110      
 children.                             
 Our school field's perimeter is 650m. 
 We also have a big playground, its    
 perimeter is 219m.So we are very      
 lucky.                                
 We have four classes,a library,a T.V  
 storeroom and music room.We also have 
 a hall and kitchen and two offices.   
 The school bus picks people up at ten 
 past eight then takes them home at    
 three fifteen.Mrs Taylor goes on the  
 bus with them to make sure they sit   
 down and behave.                      
 We have many school clubs such as     
 netball,recorders, needlework,guitars,
