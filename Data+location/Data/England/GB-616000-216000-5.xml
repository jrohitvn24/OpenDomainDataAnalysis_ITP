		<content>     The thick walls of{St John's      
{Parish Church}contain bricks from     
 older buildings, some of which are    
{Roman.                                
     The{nave}dates back to 1050 AD.   
 The{Norman chancel}was changed in the 
 14th century when two windows were    
 inserted in the south wall.           
     The{tower}was built in the 15th   
 century. The buttresses are there to  
 hold up a massive tower which was     
 never completed. Instead a            
 weatherboard belfry with a low        
 spire was added. In the tower are five
 ancient bells. The sixth was added in 
 1974.                                 
     The{baptism font}dates back from  
 the 15th century but the eight faces  
 have been broken or knocked off.
