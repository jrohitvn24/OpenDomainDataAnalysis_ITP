		<title>15BRITISH RAIL TRAINING CENTRE</title>
		<content>{The Civil Engineers Training Centre}is
 on the Grove Estate bordering Watford.
 The estate was owned by the Earl of   
 Clarendon and has been a training     
 centre for 16 years.The BRTC moved    
 from Euston to here during the war.   
 Unemployed people helped build work-  
 shops,classrooms,bomb shelters etc.   
 There are 3 different training courses
 including:Permanent Way(trackwork),   
 Plant(Machinery) and Works(repairs to 
 bridges,buildings and signal boxes).  
 In the grounds there is an old bridge 
 which students are asked to give a    
 structural report on.There is also an 
 iron girder from London Bridge and    
 about 100m of track.In one of the     
 workshops students are shown how to   
 adjust track.The students work from   
 9am to 4.45pm daily and have to pass  
 an exam at the centre before they     
 qualify as Civil Engineers.           </content>
