		<content> Nearly half of these acres are part of
 the private estate to the east.       
 Uncultivated grassland with no cattle 
 but 3 horses.A big dairy farm occupies
 the remaining acres which being above 
 the flood level has been farmed for   
 hundreds of years.Large open fields   
 with trees mainly in the hedgerows are
 planted for easy cultivation and are  
 excellent for fox hunting in winter.  
 There is a fine avenue of trees near  
 one old former farmhouse which has a  
 large cultivated garden.              
 This area is served by a secondary    
 road Sturminster to Stalbridge but has
 no bus service.A car is essential.    
 The few dwelling places range from old
 stone farms to modern bungalows but   
 the local residents are either retired
 or land-workers.Most of the homes are 
 oil-heated.Shopping in Stalbridge is  
 the most popular.                     </content>
