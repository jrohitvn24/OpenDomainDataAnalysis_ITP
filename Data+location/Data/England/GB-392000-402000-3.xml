		<title>03ALEXANDRA PARK - OLDHAM</title>
		<content>    Built by unemployed cotton         
 workers and opened in 1865,the park   
 was named after Princess  Alexandra.  
 It was "for the people of Oldham for  
 ever" and cost Â£31,000 to build.      
    It contains a boating lake, duck   
 pond, greenhouses, paddling pool,     
 crazy golf course, bowling greens, and
 tennis courts. Statues include the    
 famous "Blind Joe" and there are many 
 open grassy spaces and seasonal flower
 displays.                             
    The boating lake was built in 1903 
 at a cost of Â£14,000. It had to be    
 repaired in 1983 _ water was          
 disappearing but nobody knew where to!
 It cost Â£440,000 to solve the         
 problems.                             
     Every August the Oldham carnival  
 takes place in the park. There is a   
 procession through the town that      
 finishes at the park gates.           </content>
