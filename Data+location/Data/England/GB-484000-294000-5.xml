		<title>05The Bede House,Lyddington</title>
		<content> The building now owned by the Heritage
 Trust,was originally erected as a res-
 idence for the Bishops of Lincoln and 
 is recorded as such as early as the   
 reign of King John.The existing build-
 ing is mostly of a later period and   
 consists of a 15th century range which
 has been altered by later Bishops.    
 After the Reformation it passed into  
 lay hands and in 1602 Thos. Lord      
 Burghley founded the Bede House or Alm
 shouse which was in use up to the     
 present century.The building is of    
 honey coloured limestone with darker  
 stone dressings and a Collyweston     
 slate roof.The ceiling of the main    
 floor is beautifully carved giving    
 the appearance of fan vaulting.Part of
 the building was divided into small   
 rooms for the bedesmen.An octagonal   
 turreted gazebo at the S.W.corner has 
 an open passage for pedestrians.      </content>
