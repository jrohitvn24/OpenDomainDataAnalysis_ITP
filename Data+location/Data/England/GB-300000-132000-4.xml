		<title>04BRENDON HILL FARM</title>
		<content>    The residents have lived in this   
 area since 1948. The local farms vary 
 in size from 200-900 acres (80-360    
 hectares), Brendon Hill Farm being the
 biggest in the area.Wimbleball        
 reservoir has been built since they   
 came here.                            
    Generally, the weather is quite    
 good in summer and the winters mild   
 although there may be heavy snowfalls.
 The worst winter they can remember was
 in 1963 when they could not get out   
 from Christmas until April.           
    Both participate in local life;the 
 farmer's wife plays the organ in the  
 local church (Brompton Regis Methodist
 Church).                              
    The farmer and his wife organise   
 a gymkhana on the farm every year.    
 This is not just a horsing event but a
 social gathering with a disco etc.
