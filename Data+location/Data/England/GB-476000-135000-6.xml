		<title>06BORDON SHOPPING FACILITIES.</title>
		<content> Shopping facilities in Bordon have    
 increased since the Forest Centre was 
 opened in 1983.Until then the main    
 shopping area was Chalet Hill and the 
 A325. Now the Forest Centre is more   
 popular.                              
   As the village grew there was a     
 demand for better shopping facilities 
 and so the Forest Centre was built.   
 Also the new housing areas were being 
 built away from the old shopping area 
 so a more centralised shopping area   
 was needed.                           
   The centre provides customers with  
 free parking, public toilets and shops
 all under one roof.                   
   The old Chalet Hill shops have      
 changed during the years. The oldest  
 shop, Frisby's, is well known for its 
 turquoise coloured dome. Parking there
 is difficult because of the busy road 
 junction.                             </content>
