		<content> THE AMBERLEY CHALK PITS INDUSTRIAL    
              MUSEUM.                  
 The Museum was established in 1979.   
 From earlier times the chalk had been 
 burned in kilns to make lime for      
 building materials, fertilizers etc.. 
 This no longer happens. The old kilns 
 are on view. Buildings, machines and  
 tools from past ages of industry are  
 preserved. There is a transport       
 section which includes steam-rollers, 
 motor trolleys and a double-decker bus
 (1920s);open at the top. A road       
 Exhibition traces road construction,  
 development in history. There is the  
 Littlehampton Toll House (1909).      
 displays include omnibuses, domestic  
 appliances,wireless and communications
 and 'The History of Concrete'. An     
 industrial railway has been made.     
 There are still living in Amberley men
 who worked at the Chalk pits.         </content>
