		<title>16Old Raisins Farm, Harpenden.</title>
		<content> Where{Sauncey Wood Lane}meets{Holly   
{Lane}there stands a house on a spot   
 where there was a dwelling in{1086    
 when the first{Domesday Book}was      
 written. It would have had earth      
 floors covered with reeds and it      
 probably burned down. Records of a    
 house on this site in{1492}are in     
{Kimpton Parish Church.}The present    
 farm house which still has, in the    
 roof, some of the original timbers was
 built by{Edward Reason}around{1607.}So
 perhaps it should be called Reason's, 
 as local people pronounce it. Edward  
 Reason was tall for those times,{6ft. 
 That's why its roof is higher than    
 usual in such an old house. It would  
 have been{a fine house}for those days.
 When the present{Hatfield House}was   
 being built, some bricks from the{old 
{palace}were taken and they can be seen
 in the{end wall}of Raisins Farm today.</content>
