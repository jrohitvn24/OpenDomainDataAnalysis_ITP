		<content> The area in the survey is a rural     
 district.Although farming is an       
 important occupation in the area it   
 does not involve that many people.The 
 area can be divided north and         
 south.The north has been planted this 
 year with wheat and rapeseed.There are
 some fields of r0ugh grazing for beef 
 and milk production.However it is the 
 southern area where this is most      
 important,since this the land that is 
 low lying and closest to the          
 river.There are perhaps 20 to 30 acres
 for barley ,but most is for the use of
 cattle and for silige.There are a few 
 small fields, perhaps 20 acres,that   
 are planted for strawberries.There is 
 also a mushroom farm.One of the farms 
 has a pedigree Jersey herd which is   
 well regarded.The land is not of the  
 highest quality and does not have any 
 areas under glass.                    </content>
