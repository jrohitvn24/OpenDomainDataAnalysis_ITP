		<title>16FARWELL HOUSE, STOKE FLEMING</title>
		<content>{ Farwell House}was built about{400    
{years}ago.In{Victorian}times it       
 was rebuilt as the{Rectory.}It was    
 very large. Thirty years ago it was   
 split into two because people do not  
 have such big families or any         
 servants.                             
   The land was split up too.The{Coach 
{House}at the back is no longer part of
 Farwell but a separate house. At the  
 back the barns and stables have been  
 converted into a house called{East    
{Farwell.}There is a separate entrance 
 for them onto a different road.       
   In the gardens at the front a new   
{Rectory}was built. There are still    
 large gardens with beautiful rhododen-
 drons and a large pond.               
   Where there was once one house there
 are now several.
