		<title>16CHURCH HERITAGE</title>
		<content> The area contains 4 ancient churches  
 (St. Martin of Tours,Guston; St.      
 Peter's,West Cliffe;St. Augustine,E.  
 Langdon and St Margaret of Antioch,St.
 Margaret's). They were all built at   
 about the same time in the middle or  
 late 12th century,built largely of    
 flint and rubble. The original        
 interiors with early glass and rood   
 screens were destroyed in the Mid     
 Tudor times. In the early Georgian    
 period the interiors were simplified  
 and box pews added. The latter remain 
 at West Cliffe. Major renovations took
 place in the Victorian times. Medieval
 style were rebuilt and a tower was    
 added at E.Langdon. Today only St     
 Margaret's is impressive,possessing a 
 grand Norman west aechway. The        
 churches possess some fine Georgian   
 plate and thee is a 15th century cope 
 at E.Lagdon.                          </content>
