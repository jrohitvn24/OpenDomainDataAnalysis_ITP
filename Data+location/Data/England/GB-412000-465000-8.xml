		<title>08Ivy House Farm: Pateley</title>
		<content>  Farming is one of the main industries
 in this area. It consists mainly of   
 the rearing of beef cattle and sheep, 
 as there is now very little dairy     
 farming being done. The area produces 
 very hardy stock, as all animals graze
 on land more than 500 feet above sea  
 level.                                
  Ivy Farm near Pateley has cows,      
 calves, sheep and two geese. It is two
 hundred and ten acres in size. The    
 life of the farmer's wife at Ivy Farm 
 is a busy one, preparing food for     
 meals and doing all of the bookkeeping
 and V.A.T.for the farm. She also does 
 all the shopping in Ripon every two   
 weeks. Every morning, she feeds the   
 farm dogs. She always answers the     
 phone and gets parts for the farm     
 machinery. She does not work in the   
 fields, but does help with lambing in 
 the spring.                           </content>
