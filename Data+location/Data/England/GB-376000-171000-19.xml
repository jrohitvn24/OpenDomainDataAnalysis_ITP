		<title>19THE MUMMERS' PLAY &amp; MEDIA</title>
		<content> THE MUMMERS   The play was passed down
 by oral tradition, lost for 30 years  
 and revived about 1932.  It is a      
 fertility rite. The 7 characters, who 
 wear cow gowns covered with strips of 
 newspaper, their faces invisible, are 
 led by the Town Crier. They perform   
 each Boxing Day, first in the market  
 place at 11 am and then 4 more times  
 through the village.                  
 MEDIA  A community newsletter "All    
 Around Marshfield" is produced        
 quarterly by a voluntary team.  It was
 started in 1981, and contains news and
 pictures of local activities, news of 
 planning decisions and articles on    
 local personalities.  Copies are      
 delivered free to every house in the  
 parish.  All production costs are     
 covered by local advertising. An      
 informative  book about Marshfield is 
 produced by the local Womens'Institute</content>
