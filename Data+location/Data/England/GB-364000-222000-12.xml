		<content>   In my spare time I go out to play or
 watch television.If I go out to play I
 like to ride my bike around the garden
 and play with my brothers.I watch     
 television on average about three     
 hours a day.I also enjoy doing        
 crosswords.My mum and dad use up their
 spare time cooking,washing and        
 cleaning and looking after me and my  
 brothers.When we all go out together  
 at the weekend we usually go to the   
 Forest of Dean.                       
   A lot of people who live in our area
 keep pets.The older people usually    
 have either cats or dogs because they 
 are good company.Children have got    
 rabbits,hamsters and guinea-pigs.They 
 need a lot of care and cleaning out.A 
 good number of children have pets;it  
 is over several million.Pets are nice 
 to have.
