		<title>14THE OLD STONE QUARRIES</title>
		<content> Although there is little{INDUSTRY}    
 today, many years ago men used to work
 the Cotswold stone{QUARRIES.}The      
 stone varied from quarry to quarry    
 and some was used for{BUILDING}stone  
 and others for making stone roofing   
 tiles.                                
    There are about eight quarries     
 marked on the map today. All are now  
 disused. At the top of Tetbury Hill   
 one old quarry has been filled in with
 rubbish by a local builder. Many local
 people are very unhappy about this    
 "blot" on the{LANDSCAPE,}but the      
 Parish Council do not expect it to be 
 permanent.                            
   One other quarry has been left and  
 become a reserve for plants and       
 animals, vital in an area where large 
 open fields leave little sanctuary for
 birds and larger mammals.
