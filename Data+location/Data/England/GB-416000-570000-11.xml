		<title>11THE PONTELAND LOCAL PLAN</title>
		<content> The{Ponteland Local Plan}is           
 suggestions for land use around       
 Ponteland which particulaly includes  
 policies to do with the{Green Belt}and
 housing.The Green Belt is an area     
 of land which you are not allowed to  
 build on.It mostly covers countryside 
 and it does not include the built up  
 areas.At present,the Green Belt       
 boundary in{Ponteland}runs down{      
 Callerton Lane.It is proposed to      
 change the{boundary}so that it will   
 include the schools,sports centre and 
 the Fire Station.                     
   Housing:between 1985-1996,180 new   
 houses are proposed in Ponteland and  
 Darras Hall.80 houses up to 1991 and  
 100 houses between 1991 and 1996.In   
 the area around Eland Hall,houses have
 already been built but no more will be
 built between the period 1991-1996.
