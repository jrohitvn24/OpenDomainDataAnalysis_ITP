		<content>{  Magelake Meadow}was given to the    
 Village of Uffculme by Thomas Brice in
 1943. It is now held in trust by      
 the{Parish Council}and administered by
 a Management Committe under the       
 auspices of the Charity Commissioners.
 During 1982-4 the field was ploughed, 
 levelled and reseeded. There are      
 several drainage systems underground  
 dating back to Victorian times. These 
 were renovated and reinstated as far  
 as possible by volunteer labour. An   
 artificial 'Nottinghamshire Wicket'   
 was installed at this time.There are  
 also two full-sized football pitches. 
 The total cost of this work was over  
 Â£6 000 and about half of this was     
 obtained in grants from Devon County  
 Council and the Sports Council. This  
 field is now used throughout the year 
 by Uffculme Cricket Team and Culm Uni-
 ted Football Teams.Drainage  suspect. </content>
