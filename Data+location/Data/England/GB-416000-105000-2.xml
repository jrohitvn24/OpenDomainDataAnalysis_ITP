		<title>02Waking Up in the Morning</title>
		<content>   I woke up on Wednesday morning with 
 the light shining through my pink     
 bedroom with a big poster of George   
 Michael looking at me. Then I         
 remembered it was school today - worse
 luck! I put on my navy blue uniform   
 (yuck). Next, I was on my way to wash,
 still asleep, and past my sisters'    
 bedroom. Rachel, aged five and just   
 started school, was downstairs. But   
 Joanne who is eight was still asleep. 
   I went downstairs to have my break- 
 fast - a cup of black coffee, lovely; 
 some Sugar Puffs without any milk be- 
 cause I don't like dairy products. I  
 pick up my sandwich box and my flask  
 and put them in my bag - then suddenly
 it's eight thirty and time to go to   
 school. Joanne is still stuffing her  
 breakfast but we say goodbye to Mum   
 and go. Off round to Dawn's because   
 her mum gives us a lift in her car.   </content>
