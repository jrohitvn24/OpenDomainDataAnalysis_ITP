 children with them when they go out   
 but sometimes used baby sitters.They  
 shop in town or at supermarkets,{not  
 locally.Fisher Price toys were thought
 to be the safest and best. Most people

 not always safe for playing in.Most   
 children had friends of similar age to
 play with.{Langstone field} is not a

 very safe and is used for exercising  
 dogs although children and family pets
 usually get on well together.
