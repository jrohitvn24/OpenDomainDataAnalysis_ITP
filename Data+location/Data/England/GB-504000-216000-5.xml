 My hobby is taking part in{TRIATHLON  
 events.In a triathlon there are three 
 events; Swimming,Running and Shooting.
 The swimming is 100 yds or 100m       
 (depending on the size of the pool).  
 The shooting is 10 shots and you have 
 got to score 100 from a distance of   
 10m with an air pistol. In the run you
 have got to run as fast as you can for
 a distance of 1000 metres across      
 country.In a triathlon there are      
 different age groups 8-10, 11-13,     
 14-16,17-18,19-25, and over 25. First 
 of all you do the run and the first   
 boy goes and then, 30 seconds later,  
 the first girl goes,and so on.Then you
 do the shoot. You have five practice  
 shots and then you have ten scoring   
 shots.By the time you finish the shoot
 the score for the run is put up.
