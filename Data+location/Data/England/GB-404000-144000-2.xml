		<content> There are many footpaths and tracks   
 around this area, though some of them 
 are restricted to the public whilst   
 the army exercises and target practice
 on the firing ranges are in progress. 
 This is normally indicated by red and 
 yellow flags, which prohibits any     
 unauthorised person to pass them      
 whilst they are flying.               
 Sometimes these training areas are    
 inhabited by thousands of servicemen  
 taking part in exercises, with tanks, 
 guns and other military hardware, and 
 the 'press' even dares to suggest that
{'Cruse Missiles'}have been tested in  
 the vicinity!                         
 On days when the flags are down it is 
 worth exploring some of the 'Rights   
 of Way' to see the many different     
 plants that thrive, but of course, one
 must always  be on guard for unexp-   
 loded ammunition which has strayed.   </content>
