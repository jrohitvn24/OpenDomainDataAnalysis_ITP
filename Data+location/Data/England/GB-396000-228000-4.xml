		<content>  The school used to be housed in two  
 buildings.One,built in 1881, was the  
 junior base and the other,opened in   
 1968, acted as the infant base.In 1984
 an extension was built onto the infant
 base in the shape of a very colourful 
 sports hall and now,in 1985,a terrapin
 has been built in the school grounds  
 for the J3 and J4 class to work in.   
  As the teachers aren't allowed       
 to handle the school all by themselves
 a group of 9 people called Governors  
 help to oversee the running of the    
 school.They have a wide range of      
 responsibilities and powers.          
  The children work well and, although 
 it is a small school,they enter sports
 with teams that usually do well.In    
 1985 the school had 102 juniors and   
 infant children. Our school is a      
 fortunate one and we hope it will stay
 that way.                             </content>
