		<title>17THE AMBULANCE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The Ambulance training school in    
 Claylands Road was originally a{Civil 
{Defence}Training School which was     
 opened for Ambulance Personnel in     
 1968.                                 
   Seventy or eighty men and women come
 from all over the South of England for
 different courses lasting up to six   
 weeks. The{Local Health Authority     
 runs the school and equipment includes
 two ambulances, one Range Rover and a 
 minibus.                              
   The facilities at the school are    
 shared with both the{Police}and the   
{Fire Brigade}and at the moment new    
 premises are being built at Chippenham
 (about 75 miles away). Then this      
 important ambulance station{will move 
{away}from Bishops Waltham - probably  
 in 1986.
