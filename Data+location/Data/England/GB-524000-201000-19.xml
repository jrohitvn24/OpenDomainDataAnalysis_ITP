		<title>19Sports And Clubs</title>
		<content>    What sports I do depends on what   
 season it is. During winter I play    
 badminton twice a week and often play 
 football with my friends after school.
 At school I play football and rugby   
 outside and basketball, badminton and 
 gymnastics indoors. During rugby our  
 teacher makes us do a cross country   
 run in sub-zero temperatures.         
    On the other hand in summer if the 
 weather is nice I play tennis at the  
 lawn tennis association in The Walk   
 opposite the cricket club. As long as 
 the grass is dry I play cricket with  
 my friends and also at school. At     
 school I also like doing athletics. In
 athletics we usually do one track     
 event and one field event.
