		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO PLYMTREE</title>
		<content>  Plymtree is tucked away between      
 Cullompton and Honiton.  There is no  
 main road through it.  But it is quite
 active.  It isn't huddled together,   
 it is spread out.  There are quite a  
 few farms in Plymtree.  There is a    
 Post Office near the Church.  There is
 a School, which is very active, and a 
 Hall.  Hopefully we will soon get a   
 play area near the Chapel.  Next to   
 the Post Office is a Public House.  We
 have a Bus Service, Telephone         
 Exchange, Hairdressers, Doctors,      
 Saddlers, and a Sewage Works.  There  
 is 'Car and Commercials', a Garage.   
 Most of the children in the village go
 to the School, and take part in all   
 its activities.
