		<content>   Housing - Type and amount.          
                                       
   In all the three villages there is a
  mixture of old and new housing. In   
 our survey we found  terraced         
 housing, - old and new - semi detached
 houses and bungalows and detached     
 houses and  bungalows.                
   We found that more than half the    
 housing was new.                      
  Most of the new housing in           
 Withernwick were bungalows and most of
 the old housing  were terraced        
 cottages . One house in Withernwick   
 called Katys Nook has got deeds going 
 back to 1797 and they were not the    
 first deeds of the house. One farm    
 house was built in 1814.              
   While doing our survey we noticed   
 in Withernwick that some of the       
 older houses had had extensions built 
 on to them.                           </content>
