		<content> St Mary's Nunthorpe is the oldest     
 church in the block. Other two are St.
 Bernadette's R.C. and Nunthorpe       
 Methodist Church. Each has its own    
 hall which serves for social events.  
 Gypsy Lane and Guisborough Rd. are    
 both crossed by the{Esk Valley Railway
{Line.}At Gypsy Lane the crossing is   
 unmanned and controlled by lights. At 
 the manned crossing at Nunthorpe shops
 there is a barrier. At both points    
 passengers may alight from or board   
 trains. There are three main{shopping 
{areas.}The most substantial of these  
 is at Marton. Nunthorpe is well served
 and there are several shops near to   
 The Avenue. There are three {public   
{houses}within walking distance - The  
 Southern Cross, The Brunton Arms and  
 The Rudds Arms.{Captain James Cook    
{R.N.}was born in a cottage sited near 
 The Rudds Arms.                       </content>
