 questions and there are brochures     
 containing information about places to
 visit.                                
 Walks. There are numerous walks around
 this area leading up to the moors,    
 along the cliff top, along the beach  
 and many more. There is also a long   
 distance walk from St. Bees to Robin  
 Hoods Bay.                            
 The Sea.The only place to swim is in  
 the sea. Most of the time it is       
 inadvisable because of strong currents
 rocks under the water and tangleweed  
 which wraps round your body. Diving is
 a popular sport and there are lots of 
 wrecks to be explored in the Bay.

 birds can be seen with occasional rare
 species.                              </content>
