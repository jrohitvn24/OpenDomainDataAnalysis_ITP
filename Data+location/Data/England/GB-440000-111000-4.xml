		<title>04     The  Common</title>
		<content>   The Common is a big place on the    
 outside of town. The two main roads   
 which take you there are The Avenue   
 and Hill Lane. There are three lakes  
 on the Common. The boating lake is    
 manmade but the fishing lake and      
 the bird lake are natural.            
   The bird lake has lots of different 
 birds. The paddling pool is near the  
 boating lake. The pool is emptied in  
 the winter and filled in the summer so
 that children can play in it. By the  
 side of the pool there is a play area.
 Also there is a small bike road. The  
 fair comes on the Easter and August   
 bank holidays. In July the Southampton
 Show comes to the Common and they     
 have displays, craft exhibits and     
 school entries.                       
   There was also a zoo but it is      
 closed now.
