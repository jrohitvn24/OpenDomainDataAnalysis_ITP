		<title>14A Talk given by Resident "B"</title>
		<content> A lady, who has lived in the village  
 all her life, came to talk to us about
 the area that we live in.  Her father 
 was headmaster of our school from 1921
 until 1955.  His wages for the year   
 were Â£216 and farm labourers earned at
 the very most, Â£1 a week.  Just before
 World War II broke out, five bus loads
 of evacuees came to the village.  One 
 of these was a Jewish boy from Austria
 called Arnold and when a bomb dropped 
 on the nurses house opposite the      
 school, Arnold said, "There the nurses
 house wasn't."  She also told us that 
 bombs dropped on the cricket pitch and
 an American bomber crashed down the   
 Chelmsford Road, a bit further than   
 the Hunters Meet.  At school they     
 didn't have just milk - they had      
 Horlicks and if the children were good
 they were allowed to stir it and miss 
 their arithmetic!                     </content>
