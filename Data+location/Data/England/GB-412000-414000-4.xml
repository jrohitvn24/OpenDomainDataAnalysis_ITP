		<content>{Thornton Lodge}is an{urban area}with  
{terrace}housing, some being           
{refurbished.}It is a{built up area    
 with few open spaces. There are{small 
{businesses}and three small{Mosques.   
                                       
 The{Medina Asian Sweet Shop}was not   
 very busy. Only a few people came in  
 the afternoon. The owner's{wife and   
{sister}made the sweets{downstairs}in  
 the{kitchen.}The man sold Asian sweets
 such as{'laddoo', 'gulab jamman'}and  
{'matahee'}in{gift boxes.}They were    
 displayed under a glass shelf.        
                                       
 The sweets were made in{very large    
{deep frying pans.}We saw the kitchen  
 where the sweets were made. We saw    
 some of the sweets still in the pan.  
 They had only been made about twenty  
 minutes ago.
