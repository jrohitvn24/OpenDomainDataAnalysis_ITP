		<content>      Normally on Sunday there is no   
 rush to get up, because there is no   
 school, and Dad can have an extra     
 half hour in bed. About 9:00 we have  
 breakfast.                            
      Unless we go out for the day we  
 spend the day in the garden, if the   
 weather is nice. Sometimes at dinner  
 time we go to a nearby pub for a      
 drink.                                
      In the afternoon my younger      
 brother and I play in the garden,     
 building dens and climbing trees.     
 Sometimes Dad takes us for a walk with
 the dogs. We often go over to Troway  
 which is a hamlet about 2km away.     
      In the evening Paul and I go in  
 the bath and then watch the T.V. At   
 9:00 we go to bed.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
