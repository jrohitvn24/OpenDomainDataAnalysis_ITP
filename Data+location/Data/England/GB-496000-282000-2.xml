		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF SUDBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  Sudborough is a small quiet, village 
 of 140 people containing few          
 amenities. The houses in Sudborough   
 are both new and old. Many of the old 
 houses in Sudborough are cottages.    
 There is also a pub"The Vane Arms",   
 which is opposite the church and      
 next to the small post office. There  
 is a "Round House" at the end of the  
 village.This was once a toll house and
 dates from 1660. Also the famous      
 author B.B lives here. The new houses 
 are made of the same stone as the old 
 houses were,so they don't look out of 
 place in the village.
