		<title>06SUPERNATURAL - Wootton Wawen</title>
		<content>     The appearance of ghosts in       
 Wootton Wawen churchyard has been     
 reported over a period of hundreds    
 of years - ever since the Black Death 
 of 1348.                              
     A part of the churchyard is said  
 to contain the remains of victims of  
 the plague but the victims died in    
 Coventry, not in Wootton Wawen!       
     Legend has it that Coventry did   
 not wish to admit that the dreaded    
 Black Death had reached the city so   
 the corpses were taken from Coventry  
 at night and interred in the local    
 churchyard in the spot now known as   
 the {Coventry Piece.}                 
                                       
     A ghost of a man was also reported
 in a former dairy of {Wootton Hall.}  
 When the dairy was demolished in 1861,
 skeletons of a man and woman were     
 found.                                </content>
