		<title>03INTERVIEW  Holworthy Farm</title>
		<content> Holworthy farm consists of 200 acres  
 used for the grazing of 450 sheep     
 and 122 beef cattle. It stands on a   
 slope on the east side of Wimbleball  
 reservoir with fine views out over the
 water.                                
 The nearest shop is at Brompton Regis,
 some 3 miles away where there is also 
 the nearest telephone box and post    
 box. The farm itself is on the phone  
 however. There is a middle school     
 (9-13) in Dulverton attends travelling
 there and back daily by car, a round  
 trip of about 20 miles.               
 The general state of the roads in this
 area is satisfactory but there is no  
 bus service.                          
 The family goes to the races at       
 Ralegh's cross but there are few other
 social events in the area. You can    
 fish in the reservoir and there is a  
 local branch of the Yung Farmers Club.</content>
