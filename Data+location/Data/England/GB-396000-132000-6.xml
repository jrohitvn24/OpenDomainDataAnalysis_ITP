		<title>06PHEASANT REARING IN CHILMARK</title>
		<content>{Pheasants}are reared for shooting on  
 two farms in the Chilmark-Teffont area
 In both the{hen and cock pheasants}are
 penned in the{spring}and the eggs     
 collected. In Teffont the farmer sends
 the eggs off elsewhere to be hatched. 
 Big{syndicate shoots}which start      
 shooting in October take the earlier  
 hatchings; the farmer himself starts  
 shooting later so buys back the later 
 hatchings, rears them on the farm and 
 releases them in the autumn.{1,500    
 eggs and as many poults are produced. 
 A{recently established hatchery       
 in Chilmark is wholly commercial and  
 sells all its dayold chicks and older 
 poultsto syndicates and private shoots
 In{1985,}the second year of business  
{6,000}dayold chicks and{6,000 poults  
 were sold. The business is growing    
 fast.      ANNE McGRAIL
