		<content> Every year we go on school trips from 
 out school. Recently some of the      
 second year children went on a visit  
 to Hadrians Wall in Northumberland.   
 Stephen wrote "We left school at 9.17 
 am. The bus wen6 up onto the A19 and  
 went through Sunderland at 9.30am. By 
 9.55am we were out of Newcaste. We had
 to walk up a very steep hill to reach 
 Hadrians Wall. I took 2 photographs of
 a milecastle." Paul wrote " on June 19
 all the second year children went to  
 Hadrians Wall. It was sunny but it was
 a little bit cloudy though it never   
 rained. When we got there the teachers
 gave us our quiz sheets and we set off
 It was a big hill. We saw the fort,   
 the hospital, the headquarters and the
 commanders' house. We went along the  
 Roman Wall and one extraordinary thing
 was that the Romans ate snails and    
 frogs legs."                          </content>
