		<title>01East Hagbourne and district</title>
		<content>Within the area of study there are the 
villages of East Hagbourne, South      
Moreton, Aston Upthorpe, Aston Tirrold 
and part of Blewbury. These are farming
communities which date from Saxon      
times and one farm was in the original 
Domesday Book.                         
There are two streams which flow       
through the area; Hacca Brook and Mill 
Brook, both having considerable        
influence on the area.                 
There are three primary schools in the 
area but there is little provision for 
children below school age and few      
recreational services in the villages  
although East Hagbourne seems to be    
slightly better off than the other     
villages. Secondary Education is       
provided in Didcot.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
