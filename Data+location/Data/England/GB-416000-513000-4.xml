		<content> All of the farms in our area are{owned
 by the farmers except for two. The    
{average size}is 58 hectares. The size 
 of the farms goes from 4 to 145       
 hectares. Most of the small farms are 
 around Eppleby and Caldwell. The      
{fields}were quite small except in one 
 square where the land has been sold   
 without the farm house and hedges have
 been taken out. Most of the farms are 
 either{mixed or arable.}Wheat and     
 barley take up almost half of the     
 land. Rape is grown on 10% of the     
 land. The other crops which are grown 
 are potatoes, peas, fruit, oats,      
 turnips and kale. Only 6 of the       
 farmers employ any{workers.}Most of   
 the{farm houses}are over 100 years old
 but 2 are newer. There is 1 factory   
 farm and 3 dairy farms. The most      
 common kinds of{livestock}are sheep   
 and beef cattle.                      </content>
