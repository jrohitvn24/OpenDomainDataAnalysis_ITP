		<content> The Bramshott and Liphook Preservation
 Society registered as an amenity      
 society and founded in 1967 is        
 supported by one tenth of the local   
 population. As well as its enthusiasm 
 for investigating the watermeadows,the
 society helps local parish councils to
 protect footpaths and bridleways. A   
 booklet published in 1983 'Walks      
 Around Liphook 'includes 3 in this    
 area. The Ramblers Association Journal
 noted it as a model for Footpath      
 Guides. The Society is 'surveying'    
 possible ancient tracks and ancient   
 woodlands at the request of the County
 planning department.                  
  Keen walkers support the fortnightly 
 guided rambles and a marathon to      
 Chichester may become an annual       
 event.Small groups quietly enjoy the  
 noted but not public historic houses. 
 Liphook matters too are of concern.   </content>
