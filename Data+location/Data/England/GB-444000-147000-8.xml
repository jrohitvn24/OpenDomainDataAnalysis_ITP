		<content>   There has been a school in          
 Whitchurch for over 150 years.The     
 present Primary School which was      
 opened in 1973 has just over 350      
 children and 10 classes,although in   
 September there will be 11.The present
 headmaster is Mr.E.J.Weller.          
   There are 5 lower school classes and
 five upper school classes.The school  
 day begins at 9 o'clock and ends at   
 3.40p.m.There is a dinner break from  
 12 o'clock until 1.15p.m.             
   There is a school kitchen where     
 school meals are cooked for the       
 children although most of the children
 now bring sandwiches for their school 
 meal.                                 
   At the age of eleven the children   
 transfer to the Comprehensive School  
 called Testbourne which takes children
 from many Primary schools in the area.
