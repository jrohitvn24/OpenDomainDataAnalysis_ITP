		<title>08EDUCATION IN BURNESTON AREA</title>
		<content> When the children leave Burneston     
 School they usually go to either      
 Bedale Comprehensive or Thirsk        
 Comprehensive, depending on where they
 live. Those who live north of         
 Kirklington go to Bedale, those who   
 live south go to Thirsk. Those who    
 live at Kirklington have a choice, but
 they usually go to Bedale. Sometimes  
 parents send their children to        
 Boroughbridge or private schools such 
 as Cundall Manor or Harrogate College.
 Sixth form is available at            
 Northallerton, and there are Further  
 Education Colleges at Scarborough and 
 Harrogate.
