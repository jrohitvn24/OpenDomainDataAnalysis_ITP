		<content> The School St.School was known as the 
 Village School or The Dump.The actual 
 building would be celebrating its     
 175th anniversary this year.          
 Built in 1814 at a total cost of Â£700,
 the school was mortgaged to a Phoebe  
 Webb of Church Lawford.She lent Â£246  
 in total,at an interest rate of 5%.   
 A will dated 11th July 1799 belonging 
 to Edward Abbott of Hillmorton left a 
 legacy,the interest of which was to   
 pay for the instruction of twelve poor
 children of the parish.This was to    
 teach them reading,writing and        
 arithmetic.Edward Abbott insisted that
 only four were to learn to write and  
 do arithmetic at one time.The other   
 eight would read.If a child was away  
 for more than 4 days without a good   
 reason,he was struck off the list.The 
 schoolmaster was paid only for time   
 spent in school,not school holidays.  </content>
