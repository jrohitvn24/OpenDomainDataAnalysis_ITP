		<content>  They are open every day from 7.30am  
 and they cater for all ages. they have
 a staff of 2 full-time and 3 part-time
 workers and have 2 helpers for every 6
 children out riding. They provide     
 lessons for jumping, indoor riding and
 forest rides. They charge Â£2.50 for 30
 minutes and Â£5 per hour.              
  Their equipment includes jumps and a 
 dry suface riding centre made of cut  
 up rubber tyres, this is called pasada
 and proves very expensive. They own 2 
 tack rooms and can provide hard hats  
 etc. for those who are new to the     
 sport. Recently they have started live
 in riding holidays for children aged 8
 to 18 years.                          
  Summer is obviously their busiest    
 time and their horses, though worked  
 hard, looked fit and well fed. Besides
 grass and hay they are fed oats,      
 barley, bran, sugar beet and nuts.    </content>
