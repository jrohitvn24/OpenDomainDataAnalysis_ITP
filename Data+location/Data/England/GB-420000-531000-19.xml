		<title>19SUPERNATURAL-GHOST STORY.</title>
		<content> Gail Stothard, a 3rd year pupil at the
 King James 1 School, B/Auckland, lives
 at Flatts Farm ref04200530, the scene 
 of this mysterious story.             
 Apparitions of two distinct forms have
 been seen by various members of the   
 family; a woman appearing at the foot 
 of the stairs, and "stick-people" on  
 the bedroom walls (Gails terminology).
 The woman, dressed in long skirt and  
 blouse, appears unpredictably, often  
 forcing the mother to close her eyes  
 when decending the stairs.            
 Strangely the wall figures only appear
 when the bedrooms are stripped ready  
 for redecorating. They look drawn and 
 haggard, hence Gails name, &amp; partly   
 clad. They even appear on a later di- 
 viding wall; fronts on one side, backs
 on the other. At such times doors jamb
 &amp; have to be opened from the landing. 
 Recent CofE exorcism; result unknown. </content>
