		<content> A change in life styles over the years
 is reflected in the change in use of  
 "The Sun", "The Wheatsheaf" and "The  
 Three Horseshoes" - all now private   
 houses.                               
{"The Pig &amp; Whistle"}on the A32 serves 
 the local inhabitants and attracts    
 visitors with its home-brewed beers.  
 Coach parties are catered for in the  
 restaurant and there is a garden with 
 play equipment for children.          
{"The West Meon Hut"}situated at the   
 busy junction of the A272/A32,provides
 a welcome halt for holiday traffic.   
 During summer week-ends families fill 
 the roomy terrace with bustle and     
 chatter.  The Inn serves coffee and   
 croissants, traditional cream teas,   
 salads, bar and restaurant meals.     
 During the winter months it is a      
 popular lunch stop for shooting       
 parties.                              </content>
