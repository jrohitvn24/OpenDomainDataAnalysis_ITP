		<title>03        The Church</title>
		<content> There has been a church in            
 Winterbourne Abbas since Saxon times. 
 The rector lives in Martinstown and   
 has three other churches to look      
 after. There is a service once every  
 sunday and about fifteen to twenty    
 people attend. There have been several
 funerals but no marriages or baptisms 
 since the present rector came.The     
 Tower is square and has Gargoyles at  
 each corner.Inside there is  a balcony
 where the church band used to         
 play.Another interesting thing about  
 the church is the piscina,which is    
 where the communion vessels are       
 rinsed.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
