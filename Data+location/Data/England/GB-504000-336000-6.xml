		<title>06FACTORY CLOSES AT OSBOURNBY.</title>
		<content> In 1981 an excavator manufacturer     
 moved his factory from Osbournby.It   
 employed 50;10 from the village and 2 
 others from within the block.Only 3   
 have remained with the firm since its 
 move.The absence of the factory as a  
 source of work may lead to further    
 loss of population.The daily influx of
 people to work in the factory brought 
 trade to the pub,the garage and the   
 village shops.As most village people  
 now work outside the village and tend 
 to shop in the towns the loss of      
 custom might put the survival of post 
 office andshops at risk.The garage and
 pub,which stand on the A15 road,are   
 more likely to be able to survive.
