		<content>    The Hatfield Heath Village Magazine
 is printed monthly and is delivered by
 local people on a voluntary basis.    
 The cost is 15p and is usually paid on
 an annual subscription.  The magazine 
 contains many different items and     
 includes a diary of what is going on  
 in the village and reports written by 
 local  organisations on their         
 activities and forthcoming events.    
 Local businesses such as the Post     
 Office, pubs and butchers advertise   
 their services.                       
    The village school also produce a  
 magazine twice a year called, "Blots  
 and Jots", which includes stories,    
 poems, drawings, jokes, puzzles and   
 reports on trips and matches.  There  
 is work published from the very       
 youngest children in the school to the
 oldest in our class.
