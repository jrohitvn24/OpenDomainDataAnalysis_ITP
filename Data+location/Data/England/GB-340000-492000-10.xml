		<content> The whole territory is varied, from   
 150-600 ft above sea level; the roads 
 and lanes have steep descents with    
 many turns, and every vista gives     
 views of the valleys with streams,    
 craggy tops and bog patches. The white
 and grey slated houses stand out to   
 view surrounded by trees and many     
 lovely gardens full of coulour in sun 
 or shade. Compston House on the main  
 road near the village hall was the old
 post office and is a very typical     
 lakeland house with deep porch        
 surrounding slate dry walls, and the  
 characteristic hydrangea bushes. Cat  
 Crag at 610 ft and next view point at 
 510 ft is the Ordanance Survey beacon 
 is still in use.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
