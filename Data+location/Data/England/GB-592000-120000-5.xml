		<title>05Hop Farming near Rye</title>
		<content>  I went to see a local hop grower and 
 he said that we have hops to make     
 beer. The plants stay in the ground   
 from year to year. In the spring they 
 are cut back, strung, dressed and when
 they are 2 feet tall they are trained 
 on the strings and then sprayed every 
 ten days until September. The hops are
 cut in the hop garden by men going    
 through rows with knives. They are    
 then put on a machine which takes the 
 hops off the strings. They are then   
 taken to the oast house to be dried.  
 Afterwards they are taken to a central
 collection point at Paddock Wood.
