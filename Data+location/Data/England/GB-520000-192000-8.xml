		<content> AN ACCOUNT BY A PUPIL AT ST.PAUL'S    
 This evening on July 1st I interviewed
 my father. He went to Highwood        
 Preparatory School which was at the   
 end of Lawrence Gardens near our      
 house. The school is now a house      
 called Greenfields. I asked him about 
 the shops in Mill Hill Broadway and he
 said most of the green grocers are    
 still here, but most of the old shops 
 are banks or building societies. He   
 said W.H.Smiths was still there when  
 he was young and also Woolworths. He  
 said prices have gone up a lot over   
 the years. I asked if there was       
 anything he liked about Mill Hill when
 he was younger that he would like to  
 be here now, but he could not think of
 anything. To end with he said there   
 was a lot more traffic now.
