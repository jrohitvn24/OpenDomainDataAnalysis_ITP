		<title>17The Village of Trelights</title>
		<content>   Trelights is a very small village,it
 is all countryside and has very narrow
 roads.It has a very small park which  
 has no swings or slides but just      
 grass.Trelights is on the North       
 Cornwall coast but is not by the sea. 
 It is about 2 miles from the sea.     
 There are 65 houses and 9 of these are
 holiday homes,which are empty most of 
 the year.Access to Trelights is only  
 by car, as we are 7 miles from the    
 nearest town. We have one shop which  
 sells groceries and its the Post      
 Office. Theres a hotel with a public  
 bar which is also only open in the    
 Summer Season.
