		<title>20LOCAL HISTORY  OF  MORELEIGH</title>
		<content> In 1315 Moreleigh was granted a weekly
 Market and a Fair on two days in the  
 year - both are now extinct.          
 All Saints' Church is reputed to have 
 been built in the late 13th Century as
 a penance by the Lord of the Manor -  
 it stands at Place Barton, the site of
 the old Manor House.                  
 Petty Sessions used to be held monthly
 at the Inn.
