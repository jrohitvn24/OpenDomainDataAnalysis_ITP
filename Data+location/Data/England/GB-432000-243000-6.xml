		<title>06ECOLOGY OF TYSOE - 1</title>
		<content> The area surrounding Tysoe is typical 
 South Warwickshire countryside with   
 hawthorn hedges and oak, ash, and     
 sycamore trees. There are no elm trees
 left since Dutch Elm Disease destroyed
 them several years ago. To offset this
 farmers have been encouraged to plant 
 trees in corners of fields and areas  
 where cultivation is difficult. The   
 trees on the ridge from Sunrising to  
 Old Lodge were planted in the early   
 1960's and are mainly conifers.       
 Footpaths are little used except the  
 ones between Lower and Middle Tysoe   
 and one to the Windmill from Upper    
 Tysoe.                                
 Wild life in the area includes        
 badgers, foxes, and rabbits on the    
 hill, weasels and stoats. Muntjac and 
 fallow deer have been seen but are    
 rare.
