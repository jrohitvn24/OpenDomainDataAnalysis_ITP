		<content>{Problems and future deveolpments:     
  Each farmer is set a monthly quota of
 milk to be produced by  the Milk      
 Marketing Board.If Fred Knight exceeds
 his quota,he has to pay a levy to the 
 Milk Marketing Board.                 
         Fred Knight feels that there  
 is no stability in farming in the     
 1980s and does not know what the      
 future holds.It is he feels very      
 difficult to adjust to the needs of   
 society.With the development of more  
 efficient methods of farming and      
 increasingly high yields from the     
 land,Fred feels that changes in the   
 use of farm land are inevitable.It is 
 thus anticipated that more farmland in
 the future will be used for leisure   
 activities;camping,shooting,nature    
 trails and education.To quote         
 Fred,"What else do you do with the    
 land if you can't produce food ?"     </content>
