		<content> The village halls are at Doddington   
 Hopton and Cleeton. They are used for 
 discos or dances, whist-drives, fetes 
 or birthday parties. Special licences 
 have to be obtained to sell alcohol.  
 people hire them for special          
 functions. Regular meetings like      
 parish council meetings and mothers   
 union are held in them. The halls were
 built with money raised by the        
 communities and money is still raised 
 locally to maintain them and keep them
 up to date. They are built from       
 sheet-iron wood and plaster.
