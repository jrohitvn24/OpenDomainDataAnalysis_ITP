		<content> In May 1974,the old school was        
 abandoned due to the increasing number
 of pupils,and the tendency to flooding
 of the basement and boiler room.This  
 was because the school was close to   
 the Bevern Brook and a heavy rainstorm
 always caused flooding.The modern     
 school was built to the north of the  
 old school.Children who live in East  
 Chiltington go to Hamsey or Plumpton, 
 depending on the wish of their        
 parents.The headmaster of Plumpton is 
 Mr A.W.Dannatt,who is retiring this   
 year.The old school is 107 years      
 old.The new school is 11. There are   
 about 96 children in the school       
 nowadays,boys and girls from four and 
 a half to 11.Because of falling       
 numbers,the school is reduced to four 
 classes.When the children leave school
 at 11,they go to the local secondary  
 at Chailey,the next village.          </content>
