   She has lived in Halberton all her  
 life.She remembers back to when

 petrol cost 4.5 new pence per gallon  
 now it costs Â£2.00 per gallon.        
 Although the link road took her       
 business away  it was good for        
 animals, children and the people      
 generally.                            
     The worst change for her is

 be a shelter but it was vandalised so 
 they had to take it down.There are

 Halberton,they are called {Rock view ,</content>
