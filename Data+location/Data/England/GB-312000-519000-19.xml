		<title>19DWELLING IN LOWESWATER</title>
		<content> There are 45 dwellings in the grid    
 section: 29 cottages &amp; houses, 11     
 agricultural holdings, 1 hotel, 1 inn,
 1 guest house, a cartakers flat over  
 the Village Hall &amp; the Vicarage. All  
 are constructed outwardly of local    
 stone with slate roofs. 4 houses built
 in the last 50 years, 9 Victorian &amp; 6 
 adaptions of existing buildings. Most 
 other properties date from the 17 C.  
 with few alterations. Special         
 architectural features are mullioned  
 windows, Oak lintels &amp; stone          
 staircases. Beck House &amp; Crabtree have
 traditional Lakeland porches with     
 stone sconces. Most farmsteads have   
 been built in courtyard formation,    
 some containing old arched doorways,  
 probably carthouses. Arched entrances 
 to Foulsyke &amp; High Cross are dated, as
 are many houses at Lanthwaite cottage.
