		<title>11BRIGG DUSTBIN MAN'S DAY</title>
		<content> At 7.l5 am he arrives at work.        
 He checks his lorry, fills the tank   
 with diesel and then he loads black   
 plastic bags on to his wagon.  When he
 has finished checking everything he is
 ready to go out on his rounds.        
 He has three other men helping on his 
 round.  They all climb into the wagon 
 to set off to where the round begins. 
 Two men are bringing bags out of the  
 houses, and leaving them on the path  
 way.  Then the lorry driver comes     
 round to each pile of rubbish and     
 another man throws the piles of       
 rubbish in the back.  When the lorry  
 is full the driver takes the rubbish  
 to the tip.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
