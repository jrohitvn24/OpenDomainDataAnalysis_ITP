		<title>03Captain Peel's Railway</title>
		<content> Captain William Peel VC, a local      
 farmer, owned land at Potton, three   
 miles east of Sandy. Peel, in addition
 to his farming, was a naval captain   
 and explorer.                         
   After the opening of the G.N.R. at  
 Sandy, he obtained permission to build
 a line from Potton to connect with the
 G.N.R. to allow his produce to reach  
 market more easily.                   
 He spent little time in the area      
 because of other commitments and never
 saw the line in use. It was opened in 
 1857 whilst Peel was en route to      
 China. He was diverted to India and   
 contracted smallpox at the relief of  
 Lucknow and died the next year.       
 The line was in use for three years as
 an independent venture and then taken 
 over as a part of the Bedford and     
 Cambridge Railway, opened between     
 those two places in 1862.             </content>
