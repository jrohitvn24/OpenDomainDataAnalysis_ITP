		<title>03Resident of Old Tockwith.</title>
		<content>  {Mr.K.Gosley}owns an {Agricultural   
{Engineering}business in Tockwith. His 
 family moved here in 1929 when his    
 father bought the business. It was    
 originally a {Blacksmith's.}Mr Gosley 
 left the village school at the age of 
 14 to work in the family business. His
 father taught him the trade.          
   As farming changed, with tractors   
 superceding shire horses, so the      
 business had to change. New skills had
 to be learned. These include repairing
 and manufacturing farm machinery.     
   The premises are a fascinating      
 mixture of old and new. The old forge 
 and anvils, where the horse shoes were
 made, remain. In contrast, a modern   
 lathe is ready to shape metals.       
   Mr Gosley married a local girl. They
 have a son,{Donald,}who works in the  
 family business, and lives in         
 Tockwith.                             </content>
