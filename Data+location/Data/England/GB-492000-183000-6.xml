Was built 150 years ago in 1835.It     
used to be a dairy farm before it      
became the Horse Club.It is still a    
very popular Riding Club today.There   
are one hundred horses there;60 belong 
to Snowball Farm;and the rest to       
private owners.Snowball Farm makes its 
own hay for the horse,so in this way   
it is still a farm.
