		<title>07STEPHEN'S DAILY ROUTINE</title>
		<content>{I wake up at 7.45 in the morning.     
 Having got washed and dressed,I have  
 my breakfast,usually cereals.At 8.50 I
 set off for school,waiting in the play
 ground for the bell to ring at 9.00am.
 As soon as I go into school,three boys
 and myself take milk to the classes.  
 After registration we go to assembly.I
 spend the morning doing number work   
 and writing and at 12 noon I go home  
 for lunch with my younger brother.    
{At 1.20 pm I bring my brother back to 
 school.In the afternoon we usually do 
 topic work. Before going home at 3.30,
 we have a story or singing.I play out 
 with my brother until dad comes home  
 about 4.45pm when we have our tea.Then
 I like to watch television.About 7.45 
 I have my supper and go to bed at     
 8.15pm.
