		<title>05Conservation in Wharton Wood</title>
		<content> The main conservation and preservation
 work in Wharton Wood invovles the tree
 life.  This includes planting,        
 weeding, brashing (removing the lower 
 branches for easy thoroughfare this   
 takes place when he trees are about 6 
 metres tall), thinning (which is to   
 remove some of the young trees to     
 prevent overcrowdinglater on, this    
 takes place every 5 years).           
  When the trees are first planted they
 are planted in white hollow cones for 
 protection and later wire is put      
 around them to stop rabbits and       
 squirrels from stripping the bark and 
 sucking the sap.                      
  When a tree is mature it is chopped  
 down and sent to the saw mills.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
