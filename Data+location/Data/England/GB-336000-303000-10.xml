		<title>10A MINSTERLEY MUM'S DAY</title>
		<content>       After the scramble of getting   
 three children to school for 9 a.m., I
 help at Minsterley school with        
 swimming lessons, which take place at 
 our local pool at the Mary Webb school
 in Pontesbury.                        
       Then it is home to the          
 housework, cleaning, washing, ironing 
 etc. Fetching my children from school 
 at 3.30. p.m. livens things up at     
 home. As we discuss our daily events, 
 I prepare food for us all, &amp; my       
 husband arrives home from working in  
 Shrewsbury.                           
       Another mad rush as the whole   
 family change into uniform &amp; head     
 fo the village hall where the church  
 brigade meet. My husband &amp; I are      
 officers &amp; my children keen members.  
       Supper,children's bedtime &amp; a   
 few minutes to catch my breath before 
 preparing for Friday.                 </content>
