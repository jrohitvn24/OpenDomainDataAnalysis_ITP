		<title>11LOCAL HISTORY; OLD THRYBERGH</title>
		<content> Although{Thrybergh}has grown quite    
 large in recent years a lot of the{old
{village}can still be seen. The village
 used to belong to the{Fullerton }     
 family. Their family house is now part
 of the{Golf Club.}The old village     
 school is now a house. Some of the    
 farm buildings  remain, though they   
 are not all farms now. There are{two }
{ancient crosses, one}on{The Green}and 
{one}in the{churchyard. St. Leonard's  
{church}was{built}in the{1100's,}but it
 was enlarged  in more recent times.   
 The oldest{memorials}in the church are
 about{700 years old.}Several of the   
 memorials are of members of the       
{Reresby}and{Fullerton families.}There 
 is some{old stained glass.}Outside the
 church is a{mound of earth}where the  
{Reresbys}are{buried}and the{rectory  }
 dating from{Georgian times. }
