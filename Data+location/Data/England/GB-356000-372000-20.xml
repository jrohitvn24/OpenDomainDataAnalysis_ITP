		<content>  Norley C.E. Primary School is housed 
 in very old buildings.  It was built  
 in 1838 as a Sunday School and both   
 the school and the church are situated
 on the edge of the village.           
  "Our school is very old.  Most of us 
 have to come to school by car as we   
 mostly live a distance away.  When we 
 are old enough some of us come on bike
 in the summer time.  We have got three
 classes in our school.  When we leave 
 next summer we will go to Helsby High 
 School about 6 miles away by bus.  We 
 are supposed to be having a new school
 built down Hough Lane in a year or two
 but me and my friends will all have   
 gone to High School by then."
