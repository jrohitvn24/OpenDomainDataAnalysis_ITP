		<content>We both live on a council estate in    
Merry Hill. The estate is owned by the 
council but some people have bought    
their houses from the council.         
There used to be a farm which was      
demolished 7 years ago to build these  
houses. Near my house there are no     
roads but some grass where we play.    
There is a car park at the back of the 
houses. There is still one farm with a 
farmhouse which we can see from our    
house.                                 
Bernadette's road is called Buckley    
Road. This is an older part of the area
where people have had council houses   
since about 1945.                      
In my area most of the houses are semi-
detached. The roads are narrow and most
people have not got a drive or a garage
so they park outside their houses.     
There is a park which has a playing    
field and some swings for children.    </content>
