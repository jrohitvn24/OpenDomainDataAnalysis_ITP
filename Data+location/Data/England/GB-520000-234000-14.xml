		<content> There are three Warden controlled     
 Housing Units for Old Aged Pensioners 
 on the Grange and Standalone Estates. 
 Langleigh and Reynolds on the Grange  
 and Sax House on the Standalone       
 Estate. Each holds between 4O and 5O  
 people in self contained flats all    
 under one roof and looked after by a  
 Warden and assistant.                 
 Langleigh is just down the road from  
 our school.  It has been there for    
 just over 13 years and there is a     
 plaque on one of the walls saying "   
 This group of flats was officially    
 opened by Miss Ursula K Thomas M.B.E. 
 on June 1Oth 1972".                   
 It can house about 38 people because  
 there are 36 flats and there are two  
 couples.                              
 The oldest person is 92 years old -   
 only one person living there has lived
 in Letchworth all their life.         </content>
