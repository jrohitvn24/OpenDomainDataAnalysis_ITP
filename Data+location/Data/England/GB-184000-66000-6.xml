		<content>  At MERLIN there used to be a         
 Rampump, before they had mains water. 
 It pumped water from springs.The water
 was pumped 80 feet up and they had    
 8000 gallons of water in a water tank.
 There used to be lots of elm trees but
 most are dead from storms,but they    
 mostly have gorse and blackthorn      
 trees. They have a few problems with  
 badgers and foxes which make holes in 
 the fields and then the ground caves  
 in.They have 4 sheep,2 sheep dogs     
 and a goat.They have 40 steers of     
 beef in the barns.There are buzzards  
 in the woods which the farmers like   
 because they eat the rats.Most of the 
 buildings are built out of            
 slate,granite and elvan stone.Merlin  
 used to be called Moorland. There is  
 an old canal built in 1770,running    
 from Mawgan Porth to St.Columb.It was 
 supposed to carry sand from Mawgan    </content>
