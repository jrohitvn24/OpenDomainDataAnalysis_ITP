		<title>18ALL SAINT'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>  All Saints Church is an extremely old
 church.Between 1335 and 1970 there    
 have been 57 rectors.Now the church is
 redundant, only a couple of services  
 are held each year.They are held      
 by a society  called the All Saints   
 Society.The church itself is built of 
 red brick.It is built on a hilltop.   
 From the church you can see the       
 interchange of the A128 Brentwood     
 Tilbury road. Even though there are   
 only 2 or 3 services a year chamber   
 and choir concerts are held there as  
 well.This building was becoming a     
 ruin. It is now  maintained by a trust
 fund which was set up by some         
 Americans who came to England to trace
 their ancestors. They sent large      
 donations to repair the church.       
   In one of the walls is a heart.It   
 belonged to a lady who was believed to
 be a witch.                           </content>
