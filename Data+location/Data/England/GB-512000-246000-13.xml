		<content> Many residents are very concerned with
 conserving the appearance of the area.
 Recent examples of infilling have been
 considered undesirable both in size &amp; 
 appearance.  Anxiety is felt over the 
 lack of{houses}for first time buyers &amp;
 provision of suitable accommodation   
 for the elderly.  Concern is shown for
{preservation of hedgerows, footpaths &amp;
{trees}in the surrounding countryside. 
 Legislation to control{stubble burning
 has been appreciated.  Signs of{urban-
{isation}have been deplored, e.g. brick
 walls replacing front garden hedges;  
 high kerbing installed without local  
 consultation in spite of the{1974 Con-
{servation Report}which commended the  
 previous bullnosed pavements.  Absence
 of{street lighting}continues by public
 choice. Loss of{Post Office, shop and 
{resident policeman}are regretted as is
 the proposed closure of{Park Hospital.</content>
