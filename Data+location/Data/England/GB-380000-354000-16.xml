{       Dr. BARNARDO'S.                
{                                      
 Church Lawton Primary School pupils   
 made an overwhelming donation to      
 Dr. Barnardo's last week.             
 They presented area organiser         
 Mrs Sally Caldwell with a Â£369 cheque 
 from a junior sponsored safety quiz   
 and infants colouring day.            
 Their efforts followed a visit to the 
 school by Mrs Caldwell in May when she
 explained the work carried out by     
 their charity.                        
 Mrs Caldwell said after the           
 presentation, "I was quite overwhelmed
 by the response from the children. It 
 was a wonderful amount of money, and  
 it will be used for caring for        
 children in the North West."
