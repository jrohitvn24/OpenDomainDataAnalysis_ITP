		<title>16Escrick Estate:the beginning</title>
		<content> An early owner of Escrick Estate was  
 Lord Knyvett,who in the 16th Century  
 helped uncover the Gun Powder Plot.Sir
 Henry Thompson,a wealthy York merchant
 bought the estate in 1668,and the     
 present owner,Mr. Forbes-Adam,is one  
 of his descendants.The house has been 
 subject to many alterations,but now   
 only the cellars remain of the        
 original house.John Carr was employed 
 by Bielby Thompson in 1764 to redesign
 the wings and add a stable block.The  
 grounds were extensive,and included a 
 menagerie and a temple - now in       
 ruins.The village of Escrick housed   
 the workers,who ensured that the      
 estate was run almost as a self-      
 contained unit,which reached its      
 heyday at the beginning of this       
 century under the then owner Lord     
 Wenlock,the baronetcy dying out in    
 1932.                                 </content>
