		<content>    The passenger ferry vessels operate
 between Dartmouth and Kingswear.      
    The{'ADRIAN GILBERT'}is the regular
 ferry vessel with the{'EDGCUMBE BELLE'
 as back up vessel. They were purpose  
 built between{1955}and{1957}by        
 Blackmore, the North Devon ship       
 builder. They are 55 feet in length,  
 with a capacity of 152 plus 2 crew.   
 They carry 14 foot oars to allow      
 them to be rowed in an emergency.     
    The boats were once owned by       
{British Rail}who ran the service at   
 Dartmouth (the only station without a 
 track), but were taken over by the    
 South Hams Council when British Rail  
 provincial lines closed. Dart Pleasure
 Craft took over the service in 1977.  
    The{pontoons}have been standing for
 approximately 12O  years until the    
 Dartmouth pontoon was demolished this 
 year,1985.                            </content>
