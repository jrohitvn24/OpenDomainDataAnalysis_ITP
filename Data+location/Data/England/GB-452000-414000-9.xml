		<title>09NORTON SEWAGE WORKS (CONT)</title>
		<content> The sewage treatment plant is being   
 supplied by Whitehead and Pooler.     
     After treatment it is proposed    
 that the effluent will be discharged  
 into the {R.WENT} with a suspended    
 solids level of 15 parts per million. 
 This will allow the R. Went below the 
 plant to be upgraded to a Class 1B    
 river whereas now below the sewage    
 outlet it is classsed as a Class C    
 river. Most sludge remaining at the   
 works will eventually be discharged by
 tanker onto surrounding arable land.  
     When completed therefore the new  
 sewage works will allow for both      
 industrial and residential development
 in the area served by the works and   
 will be a significant environmental   
 enhancement as far the R. Went is     
 concerned.
