		<title>16OAKMOOR HOUSE</title>
		<content> Oakmoor House is in Durley and is a   
 boys school for boys who have problems
 with school work and thus do not      
 attend ordinary schools.It was built  
 in 1850.The school only caters for 28 
 boys;at the moment there are 18.In    
 the grounds there is a swimming pool  
 and some of the houses there, which   
 are in the grounds used to be stables 
 and coachouses.                       
 The staff of Oakmoor House have seen  
 two ghosts.One is of a man on the     
 balcony,and the other of a lady on the
 drive.Some other things happened,party
 music has been heard at dawn.Some     
 people say that the ghost is a coach  
 with horses, coming out at 10 o'clock.
 Oakmoor House is surrounded by trees  
 and is about 50 acres,with no streams 
 running through.
