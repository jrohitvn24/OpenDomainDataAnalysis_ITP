		<content>{ IFORD}(79 58) IS A TINY PLACE ABOUT  
 1 KM. NORTH OF FARLEIGH HUNGERFORD,   
 WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO FARMS AND A     
 HANDFUL OF HOUSES. THE CATTLE ON BOTH 
 FARMS ARE FRIESIANS. MOST OF THE LAND 
 IS USED FOR GRAZING, ALTHOUGH A FEW   
 FIELDS ARE SOWN WITH HAY AND BARLEY.  
 BOTH FARMHOUSES ARE PICTURESQUELY     
 SITUATED, AND ARE USED FOR BED AND    
 BREAKFAST.                            
  JUST BEYOND THE FARMS, THERE IS A    
 MANOR HOUSE, WITH BEAUTIFUL GROUNDS,  
 WHICH ARE WELL WORTH A VISIT IN       
 SUMMER. THERE IS ALSO A LARGE WOOD,   
 WITH LOTS OF PHEASANTS, AND OTHER     
 BIRDS AND ANIMALS. THE HEDGEROWS      
 PROVIDE COVER FOR MANY TIMID MAMMALS. 
  A TRIBUTARY OF THE RIVER FROME, WHICH
 IS OWNED BY BATHAMPTON A.A., FLOWS    
 THROUGH THIS AREA. COOT AND MOORHEN   
 FREQUENT THE RUSHES BY THE WEIR, WHILE
 CHUB, DACE AND PERCH CAN ALSO BE SEEN.</content>
