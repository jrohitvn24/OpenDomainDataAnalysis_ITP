		<content> On a holiday day I wake up about nine 
 o'clock. I read to about ten o'clock. 
 Around that time my mum gets fed up   
 with calling me. I get dressed and go 
 downstairs for breakfast. By that time
 it is half past ten and the stereo is 
 on full blast. I put a good record on 
 like "Material Girl" or "kiss Me". I  
 then have a shower. After that I take 
 the dog for a walk across the fields. 
 We come back and have dinner. When I  
 have finished I go out to the garden. 
 I play catch with the dog then I clean
 out the rabbit hutch. My rabbit is    
 grey and white and really cuddly;     
 That's why I call it Cuddles. My dog  
 is called Tina for no reason; it just 
 came to me when I was thinking what to
 call it. After I finish cleaning out  
 the hutch I call for my best friend at
 home, Jo, and my other best friend at 
 home, Wendy.                          </content>
