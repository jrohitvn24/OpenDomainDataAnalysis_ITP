		<title>15HOME LIFE IN AN ALMS HOUSE</title>
		<content>                                       
There are a number of Alms Houses in   
the Rochester area. Foord's is in      
Borstal. We spoke to a lady who has    
lived there for two years. She said    
"I am free to do what I like. I can go 
down to the village and visit my       
friends. It is very peaceful and I feel
safe as there is always a matron       
around. There is an alarm in my living 
room, so I am   completely safe while I
cook my own food and I am entirely     
self sufficient. I come into contact   
with the other residents and so I see  
many people. I run the library and also
help with the distribution of meals to 
less able residents. "She told us that 
the oldest inmate was 102 and that now 
the people  who live there have to pay 
a small sum per week for the           
amenities. The building was opened in  
1926.                                  </content>
