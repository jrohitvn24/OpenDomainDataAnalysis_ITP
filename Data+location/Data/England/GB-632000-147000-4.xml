 family also help prepare the food.    
 He employs six bar staff, all women.

 2.30pm and from 6pm to 11pm on Mondays

 to 2pm and 7pm to 10.3pm.   The pub   
 specialises in different types of     
 "real ales" which are changed         
 regularly.   The Landlord says that   
 his most popular drinks are "real     
 ales" and German wine.
