   At 7 0'clock in the morning I get up
and have my breakfast (cereal and      
coffee). I watch a bit of morning T.V. 
and then get ready for school. At 8.25 
am. I leave my house to go to school.  
At 9.05 am. we go in to Assembly then  
back to the classroom to do some work. 
We have three playtimes, the morning,  
after lunch and afternoon ones. I have 
a club after school at 3.30 pm. On     
Mondays I do folk dancing; on Tuesdays 
I do swimming; on Wednesdays it is Art 
Club; on Thursdays, rounders, and on   
Fridays, keyboards. Then at five       
o'clock I have my tea. After that I    
play or watch television until I go to 
bed.
