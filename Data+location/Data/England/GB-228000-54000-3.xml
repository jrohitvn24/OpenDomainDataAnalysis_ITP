		<content> The design and structure of the       
 buildings reflect the function and the
 severe environmental conditions of    
 wind,damp and topography.The most     
 suitable materials available are      
 stone,slate,concrete in all its forms,
 asbestos,non corrosive metals and     
 timber.These are used as economically 
 as possible. The major settlement in  
 the S.E.of the block contains most of 
 the population; small numbers still   
 live in and around the surviving farms
  Early buildings are of stone,locally 
 quarried,with natural slate roofs,    
 lacking eaves. Later, two storey stone
 built semi- detached houses exhibit   
 painted stucco. From 1920 most houses 
 were of rendered block and brickwork. 
 Formerly these materials came from    
 Seaton (worked sea sand) and Looe     
 (brick,carried by barge).Now materials
 are imported,by road,from any source. </content>
