		<content> The small hamlet of Platt's Heath     
 lies in the S.E. corner of the block  
 and is typically  an area of slow but 
 steady development.  The amount of    
 land available for development is     
 limited and large housing estates are 
 not possible.  The route of the       
 projected M20 motorway runs a quarter 
 of a mile to the S.E. and until this  
 has been constructed no development is
 likely between here and Sandway       
 hamlet.  All development has been     
 residential and no community projects 
 such as a new village hall are        
 envisaged at present.  The original   
 old houses have very largely been     
 renovated and yet have not lost       
 their charm and mingle with much      
 newer houses in a very natural and    
 unobtrusive manner.
