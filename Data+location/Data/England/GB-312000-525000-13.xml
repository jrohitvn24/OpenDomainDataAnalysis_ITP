		<title>13Housing in Lorton</title>
		<content> The majority of housing in the Lorton 
 area tends to be owner occupied, with 
 a few rented houses, second homes and 
 holiday cottages. There are no housing
 estates. The building of houses is    
 strictly controlled by the Lake       
 District Special Planning Board. Both 
 outline and detailed planning         
 permission is needed and must conform 
 to the Boards stringent requirements. 
 One such being, that slate is used as 
 a roofing material. There is no       
 apparent need for local authority     
 housing in the Lorton area. Any new   
 homes are built by small contractors  
 for private owners. A small number of 
 barns have been converted to homes    
 also. Many applications to build      
 houses are refused and the few allowed
 are within the limits of the village  
 or agricultural dwellings on outlying 
 farms.                                </content>
