		<title>16Harvest around Holbeach Bank</title>
		<content> In Autumn the farmer sows the seeds.  
 In the Winter the wheat and barley    
 do not grow but when Spring comes it  
 grows again. The farmers in Holbeach  
 Bank cut the wheat in August. The     
 stalks of wheat that are left are     
 made into bales of straw. The         
 stubble that is left in the ground is 
 burnt. The ground is now ready to be  
 ploughed so they can sow the seed     
 again. Also at harvest time they      
 gather the peas.The pea viner is a    
 machine which collects the peas and   
 then shells them. Then they are washed
 twice and poured into a trailer to be 
 taken to a factory in Kings Lynn and  
 frozen. This takes less than two      
 hours. The pea viners work all day and
 night. Potatoes are harvested in      
 October. Sugar beet is lifted between 
 September and January and taken to the
 sugar beet factory in Spalding.       </content>
