		<title>03THE DISAPPEARING FARM</title>
		<content>  At La Brecquette near L'Etacq,       
  there was a farm in Medieval         
 times, so legend goes. The farmhouse  
 is assumed to have been a medieval    
 manor farm but its very existence is  
 still not proven.  It is supposed to  
 have been washed away in medieval     
 times.                                
                                       
 Poingdestre wrote in the 16th C. that 
 there had been many storms and that   
 the sea had washed away much land in  
 several parts of the island.          
                                       
 Now there is nothing at that part of  
 the bay where the farm was said to be 
 except some shingle and boulders. Was 
 there a farm there? Will  the sea     
 level fall again so that the land can 
 be used for farming?                  
                                       
 Who knows?                            </content>
