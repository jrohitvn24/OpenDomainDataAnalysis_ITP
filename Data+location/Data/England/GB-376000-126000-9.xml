		<title>09Wyke Hall</title>
		<content>    Wyke Hall is thought to have been  
 in existence in the time of Edward 111
 as the home of Richard de Wyke.       
    Parts of the Hall definitly date   
 from Tudor times when it was the      
 residence of Cressbyne de Wyke, an    
 official of the Manor. The panelling  
 in the old hall and dining room is    
 Tudor. There is a fireplace dated 1611
 and the east wall still retains what  
 are thought to be 17 century mullioned
 windows.                              
    One of the later occupants, John   
 Mortimer, left two heraldic shields   
 within one of the rooms.              
    It is believed that in the Hall    
 may, in pre-reformation times have    
 been a monastery and that the lake    
 which was larger then, was the monks  
 fish pond.                            
    Nowadays, the Hall has been divided
 into private flats.                   </content>
