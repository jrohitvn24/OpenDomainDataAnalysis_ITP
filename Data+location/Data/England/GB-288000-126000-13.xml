		<title>13A Day in my Life</title>
		<content>     It was 1:30 a.m and I heard the   
 telephone ring. Mum answered. When I  
 heard Dad go outside and start the    
 car,I knew he had gone on a veterinary
 call.                                 
     Later the alarm clock woke me and 
 after breakfast I fetched my pony from
 the field. I put him in the stable and
 then fetched the lambs' milk. It was a
 hot day, so after feeding the tame    
 lambs I put them out in the field. My 
 sister and I went for a ride on our   
 two ponies, Holly and Turpin.         
     In the afternoon I cleaned my tack
 and helped to move the bullocks to a  
 different field. After tea I turned   
 Turpin out into his field and watched 
 television. Then  I went to bed.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
