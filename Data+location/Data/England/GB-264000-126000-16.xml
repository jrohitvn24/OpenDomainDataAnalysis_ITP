 The people at Torrington put the milk 
 into bottles and send it out.  Some is
 made into butter and cream.           
 The biggest number of sheep on any    
 farm in Filleigh is 200.  Other farms 
 in our survey keep 130, 100, 120 and  
 65 sheep.                             
 Some farms just keep sheep in winter. 
 The most popular type of sheep is     
 close wool, including Devon closewool.
 Other breeds are kept including       
 cheviots.                             
 We have one pig farm in our area which
 has four hundred pigs on it. All the  
 farms in our survey have at least one 
 cat.  Some have even eleven cats on   
 their farms.  Not all farms have dogs 
 but most do.  Dogs are kept for       
 different things.  Some dogs are used 
 for rounding up sheep and cows and    
 some are kept as pets.                </content>
