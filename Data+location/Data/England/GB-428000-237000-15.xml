		<title>15EDUCATION IN BRAILES</title>
		<content>   There has been a school in the      
 village from Tudor times.However,since
 1959,older pupils have had to travel  
 to nearby towns for their secondary   
 education.                            
   Primary aged children attend Brailes
 Church of England School, built in    
 1970 and pleasantly situated in rural 
 surroundings between Upper and Lower  
 Brailes.The majority of the 87 pupils 
 in the school live in the village.A   
 small number are brought in from      
 hamlets and outlying farms within the 
 parish boundaries. During the winter  
 months,evening Adult Education classes
 are held in this building.            
   Pre_school aged children may attend 
 either the Playschool, held at The Old
 School,or the Nursery Group at the    
 Methodist Schoolroom.Both meet on     
 three mornings each week.
