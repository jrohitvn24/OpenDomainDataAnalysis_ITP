		<title>13Road Hazards</title>
		<content> Many of the roads in the area have a  
 very high accident rate. There are    
 many minor accidents on the           
 roundabouts, where  drivers are not   
 hurt but cars just get slightly       
 damaged. On the Ring Road there has   
 been several fatal accidents where the
 dual carriageway and single           
 carriageways meet. Recently a six year
 old boy was killed on this road.  He  
 managed to get through a hole in the  
 fence which had been erected to stop  
 people being able to get onto the     
 road. Popley Way is an "accident      
 blackspot" and many people have been  
 killed either as pedestrains, cyclists
 or motor cyclists. A section of ther  
 A340 as it passes through the village 
 is particularly dangerous as drivers  
 tend to drive too fast round the sharp
 bends and often come off the road,    
 damaging property and themselves.     </content>
