   The next largest village in our     
 survey is New Ellerby. This village   
 was built near to the railway line    
 that went from Hull to Hornsea. The   
 railway line was closed in 1966 but   
 you can still use the railway track   
 for a pleasant walk. Like Withernwick 
 there used to be a wind mill in New   
 Ellerby. Part of the mill can still be
 seen behind Mill House. On the main   
 road there is a Methodist Chapel and a
 Post Office.The population of the     
 parish of Ellerby is 350 but this     
 includes the village of Old Ellerby.
