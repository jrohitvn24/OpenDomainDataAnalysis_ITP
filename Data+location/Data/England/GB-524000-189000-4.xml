		<title>04ST. MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The old Parish Church of St.Mary-at-  
 Finchley dates from the fifteenth     
 century, but with many later          
 alterations and extensions, including 
 the unusual feature of a second , or  
 outer south aisle.                    
 Most imposing of the monuments iside  
 the church is that of Alexander Kinge,
 Auditor to Queen Elizabeth I. He died 
 in 1618 having lived in the Manor     
 House in East End Road. Sir Thomas    
 Frowicke, Lord Chief Justice of       
 England was buried here in 1506, but  
 his monument went to make way for an  
 extra pew. Recently in Rectory Close, 
 next to the Church, an excavation has 
 revealed pottery dating from early    
 medieval times onwards, together with 
 a small quantity of flints from the   
 middle ages. Christ's College school  
 nearby has long been connected with   
 the church.                           </content>
