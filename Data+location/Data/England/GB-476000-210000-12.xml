		<title>12HARTWELL HOUSE</title>
		<content>Hartwell House is an example of a      
remodelled 17th century plan. The house
was built in the shape of an H about   
105ft. long. In the 18th century part  
of it was rebuilt.                     
In the grounds of the house is Hartwell
Church which is not used any more. It  
was built in 1756 of stone, wood, glass
and lead. The lead was stolen from the 
roof and the interior was vandalised   
during World War 2 .                   
 The Hall in The House has a large fire
place and is decorated with plaster    
panels.                                
 It has an oak staircase 8ft wide.     
 A chimney piece has the date 1658 on  
it.
