		<title>17Ashington Trout Farm</title>
		<content> 1  {Mr Taylor}owns the Ashington Trout
 Farm and lives on the premises in the 
 Old Malt Farm. He started the business
 there 6 years ago using the{natural   
{spring}from the chalk Downs with its  
 constant temperature of 10 deg.C.     
    He dug out 7 small lakes and in    
 these he keeps 2,000{Rainbow Trout.   
 They are brought from Hampshire       
 weighing 8 to 10 oz. and are kept for 
 2 to 3 weeks being sold when they     
 weigh 14 oz.                          
    In the summer customers come to    
 fish for the Trout using maggots and  
 sweetcorn for bait.                   
    Large orders of trout are netted   
 and taken away live in oxygenated     
 tanks. All fish are starved for two   
 days before being sold.               
    Some of the other ornamental fish  
 which are stocked at the farm include;
{Goldfish, Golden Orfe and Koi Carp.   </content>
