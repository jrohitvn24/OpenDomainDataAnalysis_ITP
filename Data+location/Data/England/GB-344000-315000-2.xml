		<title>02THE BICTON AREA</title>
		<content>{            }                         
   The area around Bicton is mostly    
 farmland,with some deciduous woodland 
 and a few small settlements.          
        {  }                           
   A farmer in the area was            
 interviewed.His farm,Bicton           
 Farm,consists of 250 acres which      
 support 160 pedigree Fresian cows with
 their calves, and also 30-40 sheep and
 2 lambs.The family have owned the farm
 for 21 years and have 1 labourer,     
 their nephew, who lives in a cottage  
 on the farm.The outputs from the farm 
 are silage and a little hay which are 
 mainly for their own use.They also    
 produce milk,but the amount produced  
 will have to be reduced as the E.E.C. 
 milk quota will affect them.A         
 tributary of the River Severn runs    
 through the farm and this means the   
 soil,which is sand and clay,is damp.  </content>
