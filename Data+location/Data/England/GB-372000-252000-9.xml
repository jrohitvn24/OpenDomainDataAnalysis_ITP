		<content>  South of Alfrick is the Leigh Brook, 
 which was used to provide power for   
 two mills, at the beginning of the    
 18th.Century.Gunnicks Mill produced   
 and dyed cloth.By the early 19th.     
 Centurythe mill was no longer used for
 making cloth, but for turning old     
 cloth into poor quality paper caps.At 
 the other end of the site on the      
 opposite side of the stream was a     
 clover mill, which was used for       
 separating the seed from the clover   
 plant after harvesting.A flour mill   
 was later added. The flour mill had   
 two overshot mill wheels, each 14'    
 3" in diameter.The flour mill was     
 a working mill until 1937 still       
 powered by water.In 1937 it was taken 
 over by an engineering firm,Costellos.
 They used direct drive from the mill  
 wheels to power their machinery.
