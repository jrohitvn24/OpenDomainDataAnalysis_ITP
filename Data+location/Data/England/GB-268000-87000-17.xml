{cricket pitch,a football pitch}and a  
{badminton court}in the Jubilee Hall.  
 Also,at the{school}there is an{Adult

 certain evenings,adults can take part 
 in different activities,eg.{cookery,  
{woodwork,art,yoga,}etc.               
 Throughout the summer the{swimming    
{pool}is open each afternoon and during
 most of the year the{tennis courts}can
 be hired for 1 hour at a time. There  
 are teams representing the{Soccer,    
{Cricket and Bowls Clubs.  Horse riding
 is fairly common and the immediate en_
 vironment offers many opportunities   
 for{walking}along quiet country lanes,
 over moorland or beside the River
