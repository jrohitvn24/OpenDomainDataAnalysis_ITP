		<title>02PATTISWICK HAMLET</title>
		<content>{*}The 4000 acres of Pattiswick are    
 mostly a shooting estate.It is a      
 conservation area with arable and some
 dairy farming.                        
{*}About 8000 pheasants and 2000       
 partridge are reared by the gamekeeper
 and his assistant each year.There are 
 wild deer,foxes,rabbits,stoats,weasels
 and a great variety of birds in the   
 woods and pastures.                   
{*}The fourteenth century church is now
 closed. There is a pub called "The    
 Compasses".The thirty-four houses date
 from the fourteenth century to late   
 Victorian.The inhabitants are tied    
 farmworkers,businessmen and manual    
 workers.The school bus comes around   
 the narrow country lanes as there is  
 no public transport.                  
{*}I think Pattiswick is a very        
 peaceful,picturesque and interesting  
 village.{                             </content>
