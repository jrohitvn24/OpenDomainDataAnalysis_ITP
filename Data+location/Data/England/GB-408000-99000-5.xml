		<title>05ECOLOGY FERNDOWN HEATH</title>
		<content> The{heath}mainly consists of heather  
 and gorse, with ferns and clumps of   
 wild grasses interspersed with fir,   
 small oak, elder, willow and silver   
 birch trees. There are many{insects   
 such as ants, beetles, centipedes and 
 woodlice. Some live behind bark or in 
 foliage, or make their homes in fallen
 tree trunks.                          
 There are many different kinds of     
{birds}living on the heath. The        
 woodpecker for instance drills holes, 
 angling them slightly downwards so the
 sap will collect in small hollows.    
 This attracts insects which provide   
 another meal. There are many{animals  
 such as foxes, badgers, rabbits,      
 voles, mice, rats and stoats; and     
{reptiles}such as adders, slowworms,   
 lizards, and harmless grass snakes.   
 Large areas of heath are destroyed    
 every summer by heath fires.          </content>
