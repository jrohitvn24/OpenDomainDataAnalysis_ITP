   Each of the villages of Lparish and 
 HPriors have their own{Parish         
{Councils.}We asked each one about     
 their responsibilities and their main 
 concerns in 1985.The chairperson of   
 Lparish told us that the Council is   
 concered with:-                       
   1) The establishment of the         
 ownership of common land of the       
 village                               
   2)The upkeep of parish property     
 e.g.bus shelters                      
   3)Maintenance and additions to the  
 equipment of the {Recreation Ground}. 
 .HPriors Council has applied for the  
 village to become a Conservation Area.
 councillors had hoped to have a speed 
 limit restriction, but the Highways   
 Authority said the accident rate was .
 not high enough to warrant one.
