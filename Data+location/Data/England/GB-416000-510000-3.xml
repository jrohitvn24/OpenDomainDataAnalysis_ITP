		<content>{ Stanwick church,}dedicated to St.John
 the  Baptist,   is  an  ancient  stone
 structure,  restored at the expense of
{Eleanor,} the  {dowager   Duchess   of
{Northumberland,} in 1868.  During this
 restoration, a number of  German coins
 known as the   {Nuremberg tokens} were
 found under the walls,  these  were  a
 medium of exchange  in  England in the
 15th. Cent.,  and thus  indicate dates
 when previous  building work was done.
{ Forcett  church} is  dedicated to St.
 Cuthbert and was restored in 1859. The
 registers date from 1595.             
  Both vicarages have been sold,  (that
 of Stanwick as recently as  April 1985
 following  the   retirement   of   the
 incumbent  the   Rev. K. Young) ,  and
 the  two   parishes  are  now  run  in
 plurality with {Aldbrough St.John.}   
{ Stanwick's churchyard}has the unusual
 feature of being{circular}in shape.   </content>
