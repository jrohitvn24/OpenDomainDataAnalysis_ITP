 sheds. The grass is also cut as       
 silage, two cuts each year and hay is 
 only made if the silage pit cannot    
 hold all the grass.                   
      The farm has only{three staff}who
 live near the farm in cottages.       
      The wheat is usually sown in

 barley but the Spring Barley this year
 was sown in March and should be       
 harvested in August.                  
       The small acreage of peas will  
 be harvested as soon as they are ripe 
 and sent to Scotland for freezing.
