		<title>20A day in an old man's life</title>
		<content> I got up at half past six, washed,    
 shaved and went downstairs to make    
 some breakfast for my wife and I.     
 Then I washed up the crockery and     
 utensils, then went into the garden to
 have a look around.   I cut the grass 
 and clipped around the edges then hoed
 between the vegetables.   After this I
 set two rows of beans and peas.   This
 done I went in to get the lunch ready 
 for half past one when my wife came   
 home.  She had been helping the Red   
 Cross in Bedford.   After luch we     
 washed up then sat down for a cup of  
 tea and a rest.   At half past two we 
 went out in the car to the Milton     
 Ernest Garden Centre to buy some      
 plants.   Then we came home and I     
 planted them in some tubs and pots.   
 After this I tidied up the mess and   
 swept round the paths. Then I went in.
