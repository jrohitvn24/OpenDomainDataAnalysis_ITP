		<title>16FUTURE DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> I went to Woking Borough Council      
 Offices.There I talked to a lady      
 called Mrs Vail.We found out that the 
 Council Offices were opened on June 9 
 1983.She showed the plans for the     
 future development in our local       
 area.We particularly looked at one    
 road which will go in front of my     
 house.This is called the St Johns     
 Relief Road.It is designed to relieve 
 St Johns of all the heavy traffic.We  
 also saw the plans for Brookwood Lye  
 but these have got to be finalised.A  
 development company wants to build a  
 factory there,but there is alot of    
 argument about this.Part of Brookwood 
 Hospital is going to be knocked down  
 and a Marina built as well as more    
 shops.Some land is being reserved for 
 building in 1991 and some for leisure.
 I wonder if all these things will     
 happen.         (SARAH BROWN. Age 10) </content>
