{"I promise that I will do my best, to 
{do my duty to God.  To serve the Queen
{and help other people and to keep the 
{guide law."                           
 When you have said your promise you   
 are given a special promise badge     
 which is bronze and shaped like a     
 three leafed clover.   You are also   
 given a patrol badge which identifies 
 which patrol you are in.  You are     
 given a pack badge as well which      
 identifies which pack you are in.  I  
 am in Nightingale and my patrol leader
 is Mary.  I am in pack 2nd Penton and 
 my guider is Mrs. Dearden.  I bring my
 subs in every week which is twenty    
 pence, and that pays for all the      
 outings we go on.  Emma and I have    
 been on an outing to Farnborough with 
 the guides and we went canoeing which 
 was great fun.                        </content>
