		<title>01  A General Description</title>
		<content>   This area is situated on the lower  
 Western slopes of the Pennines as they
 make their descent to the flat        
 Cheshire Plain below.It is an upland  
 area of open countryside criss_crossed
 by drystone walls which divide it into
 numerous fields.It has a vegetation   
 cover mainly of grassland except on   
 the highest ridges and plateaux, where
 this gives way to heath and peaty     
 moorland.Deciduous trees line the     
 lower banks of the many streams and   
 rivulets, and extensive coniferous    
 plantations are to be found on the    
 higher hillsides.The valley slopes are
 dotted with an ever increasing number 
 of hawthorn bushes but the high       
 windswept tops remain desolate and    
 treeless.There is also the occasional 
 pocket of bog identified by the clumps
 of tufted grass so typical of marshy  
 land.                                 </content>
