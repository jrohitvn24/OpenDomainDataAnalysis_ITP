 On Saturday I went to Lincoln with my 
 mum and dad. In the morning we did    
 some shopping and at 1 o'clock we went
 for our dinner. I had a steak and     
 kidney pie, baby carrots and chips    
 with a can of coke.                   
 After dinner we went shopping again. I
 bought some pyjamas and trainers      
 from Marks and Spencers. My dad and I 
 went to W.H.Smith and as I had 60p    
 to spend I bought a Radio and T.V.    
 times.
