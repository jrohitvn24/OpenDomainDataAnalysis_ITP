		<title>11The School.Kingsbury.</title>
		<content> Our primary school is 107 years old.It
 is made of hamstone and has 3         
 classrooms,one of which is used for an
 assembly hall and dinner room.In 1985/
 6 the house,which is attached to one  
 end of the school,is to be used to    
 make a classroom so that one of the   
 present classrooms can be used as a   
 hall.73 children attend now(1985).They
 come from an area which includes the  
 villages of Kingsbury,Stembridge and  
 East and West Lambrook.50 come by car,
 19 cycle and 4 walk.20 children have  
 school dinners,which come in sealed   
 containers from Stoke-sub-Hamdon.The  
 others bring sandwiches.The school has
 a playground,a field and an open air  
 swimming pool.To the west of the      
 school field is a field used for      
 grazing and silage,to the north is an 
 orchard.This week(July 1985)we planted
 10 oak trees at the edge of the field.</content>
