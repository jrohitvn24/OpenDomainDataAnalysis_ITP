		<content> The flora and fauna in the rest of the
 block does not differ greatly from    
 that found on the ranges,only changing
 when the soil structure becomes       
 different,e.g. greensand.The recent   
 absence of barn owls is probably      
 linked with decline in the number of  
 shrews and voles.House sparrows also  
 disappeared when the human inhabitants
 of Imber were moved out at the        
 start of the 1939 war.Among other     
 birds spotted are whinchats,kestrels, 
 stonechats,sparrowhawks,larks,plovers 
 and buzzards.Hawthorn grows widely on 
 uncultivated downland when birds drop 
 seed,but due to the shallow soil it   
 does not live very long.The ranges are
 generally colder at most times of the 
 year but otherwise the climate is no  
 different from the rest of the area.
