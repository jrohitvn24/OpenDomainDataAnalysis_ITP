		<title>19A MIDHURST TEENAGER'S LIFE</title>
		<content> Teenage life in 1985 can be enjoyable 
 but can also be difficult.School life 
 is much improved.Modern facilities are
 provided for our education.Interesting
 events such as foreign exchanges and  
 outings to exhibitions and famous     
 places take place.Sports facilities   
 have improved. Sport is popular as a  
 hobby and we use the facilities at the
 Grange Centre.                        
     Some have bad relationships with  
 their parents.This is a common problem
 between children and adults.Some      
 parents are uncaring.This can lead    
 children to take up smoking or drug   
 abuse.Examinations are important and  
 decide our future.Many of us get      
 nervous and perform badly.Unemployment
 among teenagers is high and a great   
 worry to us.Teenage life is difficult 
 and complicated yet it can also be    
 pleasant and interesting.             </content>
