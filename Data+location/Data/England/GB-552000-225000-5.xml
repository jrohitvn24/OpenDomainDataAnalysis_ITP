		<content> village entertainments but it seems   
 this apathy permeates every facet of  
 village life.  Many organisations seem
 to be experiencing declining          
 attendances and interest despite a    
 continuing rise in the population and 
 an increase in leisure time.  We are  
 in danger of becoming a dormitory     
 village and thus destroying, by       
 neglect, the very environment many of 
 us moved here to be part of.          
      The Parish Council would like to 
 see more people at village meetings   
 but they don't want people who just   
 want to protest about a particular    
 local grievance, or to enlist the aid 
 of the Parish Council in furthering a 
 personal cause, but to come and share 
 in all aspects of the most local of   
 local government.
