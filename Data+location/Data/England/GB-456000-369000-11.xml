		<title>11The village of Norton.</title>
		<content> Norton is a small village close to the
 gentle trout stream _The  Poulter.Once
 on the main coach road between        
 Mansfield and Worksop ,the Village    
 used to boast 5 inns and 10 shops ,   
 but in 1900 the 5th Duke of Portland  
 objected to the growing traffic       
 passing so close to his residence and 
 the road was replaced by the present  
 A60 through Cuckney.Now there is only 
 one shop and there has been no public 
 house for over 75 years.              
  The village comprises of old stone   
 properties rented from the Welbeck    
 Estate and a few modern bungalows for 
 older people.There is no church.      
  All residents questioned were very   
 content with life at Norton despite   
 the lack of facilities.Considerable   
 concern and and inconvenience has been
 caused recently however by damage to  
 property through mining subsidence.   </content>
