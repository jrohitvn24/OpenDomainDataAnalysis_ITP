		<title>02Wingate - Spoil heap</title>
		<content>    For almost a hundred years the     
{colliery waste heap}dominated the     
 landscape of the village. It could be 
 seen from the window of almost every  
 house. To the outsider it was{ugly,   
{dirty}and a{blot on the landscape.    
 About two hundred feet high and{the   
{shape of a volcano,}it was a symbol of
 security and a reminder of years of   
 struggle and hard work.               
    It was unbelievable that it could  
 ever change.                          
   {A model appeared}in the local      
 community centre. It showed{Wingate   
{with no spoil heap,}just grassland and
 a recreation area. It looked strange, 
{reaction was mixed.}Some liked the new
 Wingate, many liked it the way it was.
    Authority had decided, however, and
 for six months{giant earth movers     
 covered Wingate in a{thick layer of   
{dust.}Maybe the outsiders are happy.  </content>
