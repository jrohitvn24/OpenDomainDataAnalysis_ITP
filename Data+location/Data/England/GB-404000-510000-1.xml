		<title>01A Higher ground rural area</title>
		<content> This section of countryside is a rural
 area, having no industry other than   
 farming. Large portions of the land   
 are uncultivated grassland supporting 
 mainly sheep and some cattle.Generally
 the land is hilly, gently rolling,    
 rising at its highest point to        
 something over 233m. where rough      
 pasture and moorland predominates.    
 The one small village in the section  
 comprises an old well-built and       
 flourishing farmstead, with several   
 other homes of varying sizes and a    
 very small old church. The land around
 the village is cultivated and supports
 a good harvest of wheat and some oats.
 The river Greta, running through the  
 middle of the section, provided a     
 variation in scenery and there is a   
 good sprinkling of trees, mainly      
 deciduous, with some plantations on   
 the lower ground.                     </content>
