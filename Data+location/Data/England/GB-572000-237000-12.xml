		<content> Toppesfield Congregational Church was 
 built in 1885 and seats 250 people.   
 Before that date,worshippers met in a 
 former woodshed to the rear which had 
 been converted into a hall.The Church 
 currently needs major repairs and     
 services are once again being held in 
 the old hall,which has been repaired  
 and redecorated.The Church now has 11 
 members and 8 adherents (worshippers  
 who have not accepted membership).    
 Previously it had a joint pastorate   
 with Stambourne Congregational Church 
 but it is no longer strong enough to  
 afford a minister and relies on lay   
 preachers and visiting ministers to   
 take services.When the Congregational 
 Church in England and Wales united    
 with the Presbyterian Church in 1972, 
 the Toppesfield Church members voted  
 to become an independent Church affil-
 iated to the Congregational Federation</content>
