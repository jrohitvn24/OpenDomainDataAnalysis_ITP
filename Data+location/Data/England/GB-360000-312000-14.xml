		<title>14WROCKWARDINE CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The Church at Wrockwardine is        
 typical of many that are around the   
 County. The way of life that used to  
 centre around the Church is rapidly   
 passing, and it is in village         
 communites like Wrockwardine that the 
 Church remains at the centre of the   
 community.                            
 One of the problems is the upkeep of  
 the church, with its decline in use   
 and for the past few years the village
 have been having various fund-raising 
 events to raise enough money to repair
 the steeple. The barometer on the side
 shows how much money has been raised  
 in order to do these repairs
