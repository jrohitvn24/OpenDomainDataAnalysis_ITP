		<title>01Ticehurst Area - Overview</title>
		<content>    Ticehurst civil parish is the 1086 
 Domesday 'Esseswelle'. This block     
 contains the main settlement from     
 Three Leg Cross along the B2099]B2087 
 ridgeway to Flimwell on the A21. Good 
 rail links with London and the coast  
 are at nearby Wadhurst.               
    Ticehurst is a typical Wealden     
 hilltop village centred round the     
 Square and 13th century St Mary's     
 Church. Timber, brick/tile and stone  
 are local building materials. It is   
 not a tourist village, shops/sevices  
 cater for the local community which   
 with new housing over the last forty  
 years is a good balance of ages and   
 occupations, new and established      
 families.                             
    Mixed farming including pick-your- 
 own fruit, commercial woodland, golf  
 course and reservoir with water sports
 are the main land uses.               </content>
