		<title>05Retired Lady, Stoulton</title>
		<content>     A retired Lady lives in a         
 Fifteenth Century cottage in the      
 village of Stoulton.  The cottage is  
 called "Old Forge" because it was     
 previously the smithy. Now, in her    
 retirement she plays golf, bridge and 
 she is very much involved in the      
 activities concerned with preserving  
 the beauty of the countryside. She is 
 one of the parish council footpath    
 representatives. There are 44         
 footpaths around Stoulton.            
     She has seen many changes taking  
 place in the countryside over the last
 twenty years;hedges lost and thousands
 of elm trees dying giving a more open 
 appearance to the landscape.          
     Stubble burning is strongly       
 resented by local people because the  
 farmers have not always kept it under 
 control.                              
                                       </content>
