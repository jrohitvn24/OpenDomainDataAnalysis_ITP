		<title>13OTHER OCCUPATIONS</title>
		<content> Many of the occupations in the area   
 are involved in the service of farming
 and tourism. The three garages, whilst
 supplying petrol and maintenance for  
 domestic vehicles play a large part in
 the supply and maintenance of farm    
 machinery and equipment.              
 Several jobbing builders and joiners  
 thrive in the area, as does a larger  
 building company with premises in the 
 disused Askrigg Station and a         
 government-sponsored advanced factory 
 unit. Close by is a feed merchant.    
 With the advent of tourism, the       
 catering business has flourished from 
 the establishment of private hotels   
 and restaurants to domestic bed and   
 breakfast accommodation, providing a  
 great deal of part-time and seasonal  
 employment.                           
 There is also a thriving artistic     
 community.                            </content>
