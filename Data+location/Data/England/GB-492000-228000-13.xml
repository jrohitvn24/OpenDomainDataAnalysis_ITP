		<title>13HEATH V.A. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Great concern arose in the area in    
 1983 when Heath V.A.(Voluntary Aided) 
 school was proposed for closure.      
                                       
 Of some 28,000 schools in England and 
 Wales, nearly one third are voluntary 
 aided by groups, mainly religious.    
                                       
 Heath school, founded in last Century 
 is one of some 5,000 belonging to the 
 Church of England.                    
                                       
 Suggestions that it might have to     
 close, due to falling numbers of      
 pupils and difficulties with the old  
 buildings caused many protests.       
                                       
 The school future now looks more      
 secure. Many rural schools have been  
 closed and the decline in the birth   
 rate means that many schools built in 
 the 1950s are likely to close.        </content>
