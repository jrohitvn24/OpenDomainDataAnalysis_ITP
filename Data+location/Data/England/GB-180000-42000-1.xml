		<content> The landscape consists of urban       
 development in the north with the     
 remainder of the area being rural. The
 buildings are developed in a linear   
 fashion along the A 39 to the West. To
 the East the Port has declined. Lemon 
 Quay is a Car Park and Urban          
 redevelopment is proposed for Newham  
 with the chance of a small boat       
 marina. The rural hinterland is       
 relatively sparse in population with a
 few hamlets and farms providing       
 commuting or rural work opportunities.
 The dairy/mixed farm economy makes    
 this both a productive and attractive 
 landscape with the estuarine scenery  
 contrasting with urban areas to the   
 North and industrial dereliction to   
 the West. These soft contours are     
 typical of mid-Southern Cornwall and  
 continue North-East through the       
 Roseland Peninsula.                   </content>
