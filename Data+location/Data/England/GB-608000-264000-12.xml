There are about thirteen farms in the  
area and most of them grow crops. A    
few keep poultry and pigs. The most    
inportant cereal  crops are barley     
and wheat.Another inportant crop is    
sugar beet which is harvested in the   
autumn. During May and June many of    
the fields are golden yellow while     
the oil seed rape is in blossom.       
It is harvested in the summer when     
the seeds are set. Some farmers grow   
peas and beans which are harvested     
in the summer. The two most important  
machines which the farmers use are     
tractors and combine harvesters.       
There are a lot of attachments to go on
the back of the tractors such as       
balers, sprayers, ploughs and trailers.
