 BURRINGTON SCHOOL WE HAVE HAD A       
 SPORTSDAY. WE HAVE THREE TEAMS.THEY   
 ARE SUN, MOON AND STARS.

 RACES, HIGH JUMP, LONG JUMP, EGG AND  
 SPOON RACES, HURDLES AND LOTS MORE.   
    THE WINNER GETS THREE POINTS,THE   
 NEXT PERSON GETS TWO POINTS,AND THE   
 LAST PERSON GETS ONE POINT. WE WEAR   
 COLOURED BANDS TO SHOW WHICH TEAM WE  
 BELONG TO. YELLOW IS FOR SUN, BLUE IS
