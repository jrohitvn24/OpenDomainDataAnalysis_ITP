		<title>07POCKET MONEY - A GIRL</title>
		<content> THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF POCKET MONEY A  
 WEEK FOR A 13 YEAR OLD GIRL IS ABOUT  
 Â£2 OR Â£3. HOW DO WE EARN IT? I GET MY 
 POCKET MONEY BY DOING THE HOUSE WORK  
 ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS.THIS INCLUDES
 THE HOOVERING,POLISHING,DUSTING,A BIT 
 OF GARDENING AND SOME COOKING.OF      
 COURSE, I ALSO MAKE MY OWN BED AND    
 KEEP MY BEDROOM CLEAN AND TIDY.I THINK
 OTHER CHILDREN DO THE SAME SORTS OF   
 THINGS IN THEIR HOMES.WHAT DO I SPEND 
 IT ON? I SPEND HALF OF MY MONEY AND   
 TRY TO SAVE THE REST FOR SOMETHING    
 IMORTANT OR EXPENSIVE.I BUY SWEETS AND
 GENERAL THINGS THAT I NEED DURING THE 
 WEEK AND SAVE UP FOR SOMETHING LIKE A 
 SPECIAL DRESS OR A PERSONAL STEREO    
 UNIT.THE GENERAL IDEA OF POCKET MONEY 
 IS,I THINK, TO LEARN HOW TO HANDLE    
 MONEY AND TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT      
 PROPERLY.
