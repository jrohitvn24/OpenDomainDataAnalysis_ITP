		<title>16THE MINERS' STRIKE</title>
		<content>  At Christmas the Action group held a 
 party for the miners' children.Every  
 child up to the age of 11 got a       
 present.Children over 11 received Â£5  
 and a selection box.We played several 
 games.                                
  After Christmas more men went back to
 work.Eventually so many went back     
 because they had no money that the    
 strike ended.Now all the men are      
 working hard trying to save their jobs
 and pay off all their bills which they
 could not afford during the strike.   
  Lots of people were injured,some even
 died.There was a lot of trouble       
 between the police and the miners but 
 now that is getting back to normal.   
  A lot of families are trying to      
 forget what the strike did to them and
 their children.
