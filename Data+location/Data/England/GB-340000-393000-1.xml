		<content>    This sector consists of two large  
 corporation housing estates separated 
 by a country park and villages whose  
 history goes back to Viking times.    
   {Croxteth}lies within the Liverpool 
 City boundary and was built in the    
 50's.  {Cantril Farm}was built in the 
 70's, extending an existing develop-  
 ment but straddling the border into   
 Knowsley District, who have renamed   
 their section{Stockbridge Village}and 
 started an extensive face-lift.       
{   Croxteth Hall}is in a Country Park 
 stretching from{West Derby}(already a 
 thriving community at the time of the 
 Norman Conquest) to{Knowsley Village  
 (after which the Metropolitan District
 was named when{Huyton}and{Kirkby}were 
 joined) and nestling into it is the   
{Brookside}estate of the Channel 4 Soap
 Opera.  {Knowsley Hall}and{Knowsley   
{Safari Park}adjoin the village.       </content>
