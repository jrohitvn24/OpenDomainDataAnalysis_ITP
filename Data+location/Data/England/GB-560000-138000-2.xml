		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF PEMBURY</title>
		<content>{      The Village of Pembury.}        
  The village of Pembury is a dormitory
 village, with many of the inhabitants 
 working in Tunbridge Wells. The       
 original village laid to the north,   
 near Lower Green. After 1820, and the 
 first stage coaches, the centre of the
 village moved up to the A 21, the     
 London to Hastings road. At this time 
 there was a hostelry and turnpike.    
 There was stabling in the High Street,
 on the Green was a wheelwrights and   
 forge. On the site of Brednock Garage 
 there was a carriage paint shop.      
  The village is now sprawling, the    
 Green only sees the occasional fete or
 car rally. It is a triangular shape,  
 there are no buildings on it, just a  
 beautiful old chestnut tree and a     
 horse trough dedicated to the martyr, 
 Margory Polley.
