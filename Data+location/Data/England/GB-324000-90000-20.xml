		<title>20    A Typical Saturday</title>
		<content>    When I wake up, I go into the front
 room and watch television. If there's 
 nothing interesting I go back to bed. 
 About an hour later I go back and     
 watch T.V. again, until breakfast is  
 on the table. That's about 10 o'clock.
 After Breakfast I get dressed. I      
 usually go out and play with my rubber
 tyre (swing). After that mum asks me  
 to take the dog for a walk. When I    
 come back, dinner is usually on the   
 table, (sandwiches or boiled egg).    
 After lunch we go for a walk or watch 
 T.V. If it is boring I ask mum to play
 catch with me.                        
    By then mum starts making the tea  
 so I play football. When mum has made 
 the tea we chomp it up as fast as we  
 can so I can watch T.V.               
    After I have watched T.V. for two  
 hours I get ready for bed.
