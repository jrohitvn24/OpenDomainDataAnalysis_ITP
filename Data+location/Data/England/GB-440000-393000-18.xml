		<content> Robert Jenkins steel works was built  
 in 1855. They make dished and flanged 
 heads to finish off other products.   
 They make 4 inch to 16 feet dishes for
 going on top of gas canisters.        
 They put on a special coating of      
 sulphuric acid and zinc to stop       
 metal corroding.  They employ         
 300 people. 30 of these are women.    
 In certain departments they wear      
 special clothes. In the office they   
 wear a uniform. On the shop floor they
 have 2 eight hour shifts. In the      
 office they work 9.00 a.m. to 5.00    
 p.m. They say the wages are good for  
 the area. They think the future will  
 be very good for them.
