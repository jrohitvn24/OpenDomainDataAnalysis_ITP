  A description of Morecambe Promenade 
                                       
If it is a fine night and you come down
street you will come  out on the       
promenade and you will see a beautiful 
sunset going down over the hills of the
Lake Distrct. "All the ones, legs      
eleven," and you will hear the noisy   
clatter of money coming out of slot    
machines. People walk along looking    
into shops and stuffing candy-floss    
into their mouthes. At the edge of the 
Promenade you can hear the swish of the
sea and across the water you can see   
fishermen working on their boats and   
seabirds following behind them, trying 
to catch the fish in the fishermen's   
nets. At the end of the season the     
illuminations are on and the lights    
reflect in the sea.
