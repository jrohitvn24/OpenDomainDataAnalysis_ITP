		<title>15A day in the life of ...</title>
		<content> My walk to school is boring and long. 
 7.30 am is too early for me to get    
 up, but my alarm clock reminds me to  
 every morning. On my route to school I
 pass the Epsom Downs and Tattenham    
 Corner.                               
 The road where Tattenham Corner and   
 Merland Rise cross is always busy with
 heavy traffic. Approaching Chetwode   
 Road I begin to see more people going 
 to school.                            
 The timetable varies but the day      
 always starts at 8.45 am. There are  4
 periods in the early part of the      
 morning, break, 2 periods, lunch from 
 1 pm to 2.20 pm,then a further 2      
 periods before deregistration at 3.40 
 pm. Each lesson lasts 35 minutes, but 
 subjects often use double periods.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
