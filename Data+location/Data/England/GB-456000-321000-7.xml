		<content>      1985 is a year of decision for   
{St. Leonard's Church, Hoton}and{St.   
{Andrew's Church, Prestwold.           
      Architect's inspection has       
 revealed that the buildings require a 
 great deal to be spent on them.       
 (Â£60000 &amp; Â£20000). The Parochial      
 Church Council has recommended that   
 St. Leonard's should be closed and St.
 Andrew's maintained if funds can be   
 raised. Lengthy consultations will    
 take place before there is a final    
 decision.                             
      Fund raising activities have been
 organised throughout the Parish.      
      Opinion is divided about what    
 should happen, although many feel that
 the buildings must not be allowed to  
 decay.
