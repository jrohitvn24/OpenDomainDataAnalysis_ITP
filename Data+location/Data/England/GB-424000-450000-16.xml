		<content>   The church was built by Henry and   
 Ellen Williams, local benefactors.    
   The{foundation stone}was laid in    
 Sept 1885 and the church was          
 consecrated in Sept 1886. Built in    
{local sandstone}from Pot Bank Quarry, 
 as are most of the older buildings.   
   One of the attractive features are  
 the{windows,}all stained glass        
 dedicated to members of the Williams  
 and Dugdale families.                 
   The South East window represents    
 St.John viewing Jerusalem. In the     
 other window on the south side,St.John
 is represented as falling at the feet 
 of the angel on the bank of the River 
 of Life.  Each window has two lights  
 and on the North side each light has a
 separate subject. The first light of  
 the North West window portrays the    
 angel with his right foot on the sea  
 and left on the earth.                </content>
