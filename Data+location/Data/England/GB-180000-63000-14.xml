		<content> There was Iron Age pottery from 4-2   
 B.C. There was a Yorkshire-type lynch 
 pin, a terret ring, a triangular      
 bronze link, a wire finger-ring and a 
 dolphin-type broach (early 2 B.C)  A  
 Vespasian coin (c.71 A.D.) and a      
 Trojan coin (c.107 A/D.) were also    
 found. Two rows of round houses, which
 were build across the island were     
 found, two of which were excavated.   
 The style in which the outside walls, 
 which held the thatched roof were     
 constructed was unique. Large         
 arch-shaped stones were put up-right  
 and the space between filled with     
 dry-stone walling. This sturdy        
 construction is thought to belong to  
 the Celts, who were skillful          
 workers.One of the ramparts was       
 excavated.
