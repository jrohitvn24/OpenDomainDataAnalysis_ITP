 of the Nar Valley.It is an unusual

 planted between 1975 and 1977.Today it
 covers an area of 8 acres.It is part  
 of the Lexham Hall estate and         
 continues

 has been going on for 18 centuries.   
 For efficient{farming}purposes the    
 vines are supported by a 1 and a half 
 metre trellis and 1 metre separates   
 each vine with 2 metres between each  
 row.Harvesting takes place in mid     
 October and yields vary between 2 and 
 4 thousand bottles per acre.The wine  
 is ready to drink by July the next    
 year and is available from local      
 shops.{
