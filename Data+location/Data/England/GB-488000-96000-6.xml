		<title>06ROSE GREEN INFANTS' SCHOOL</title>
		<content> This school is fifteen years old and  
 thirteen years ago an extension was   
 built.  The headteacher, Mrs. Haig,   
 told us that there are seven teachers 
 and 191 children.  On the day we      
 visited the school, two classes were  
 out visiting Amberley Chalk Pits      
 Museum.                               
                                       
 The school has two colour televisions,
 a video and a B.B.C. 'B' computer.  We
 saw a room with six sets of headphones
 where the children can listen to      
 stories.  They had pets, toilets and  
 libraries in every class and a largish
 hall.  We went outside and found a big
 field and playground.  A pupil in the 
 top year told us that they do         
 mathematics, English, reading, P.E.,  
 music, drawing, sewing and painting.  
 We thought the school had a happy and 
 bright atmosphere.                    </content>
