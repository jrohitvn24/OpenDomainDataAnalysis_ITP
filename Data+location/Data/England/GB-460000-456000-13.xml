		<title>13A PLAYGROUND GAME</title>
		<content>  One of my favourite playground games 
 is Billy Tig ,we play that nearly     
 every playtime and up to eighty people
 can play.                             
  The rules are that a person counting 
 gives you one hundred off and you have
 to run and hide.Then the person that's
 on has twenty seconds in his area to  
 see if he can see anyone.Then after   
 the 20 seconds are up he is allowed   
 out to try and tig someone.The people 
 who are hiding have to try to get     
 their Billy at the Billypost and say  
 Billypost and say Billy 1,2,3 and then
 your name and if the person who is on 
 tigs someone they are on.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
