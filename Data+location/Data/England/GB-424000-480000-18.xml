		<content> May,now over 80, was brought up by her
 Grandma in a draughty cottage,since   
 demolished.She won a scholarship to   
 Ripon High School - the 2 mile walk   
 then a train ride was too much.She    
 looked after the old folk and went out
 cleaning.Her son is an Oxford         
 graduate!                             
 Still upright and vigorous at 80 Tom  
 has been an unofficial roadman keeping
 the draining gulleys clear and        
 sweeping the beck.He rings the bell at
 church &amp; goes to every service in     
 church &amp; chapel.                      
 Sally used to be a cook and now nearly
 80 she is still visited in her cosey  
 home by her former mistress and family
 tho'they moved away.They make sure she
 hears important news at first hand.   
 Annie uses her "green fingers" to grow
 all kinds of fuchias &amp; geraniums in   
 tubs and baskets,her yard is a delight</content>
