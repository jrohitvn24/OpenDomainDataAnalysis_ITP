		<content>{  OWSTON'S MEDIAEVAL MONASTERY        
{ }Owston was once a centre of ancient 
 routes and its church is the surviving
 relic of an Augustinian abbey founded 
 in 1161. There is Norman stonework on 
 the south side, the north aisle and   
 arches are thirteenth century, the    
 tower fourteenth century, and the     
 parapet and spire early sixteenth     
 century. Earthworks are evident in    
 neighbouring fields to west and south,
 and some of these, together with a    
 small lake, are the remains of        
 mediaeval fish ponds. The abbey would 
 have farmed all the surrounding       
 countryside and a moated site half_way
 to Knossington was a fortified        
 granary.Hedges surrounding the village
 are about{400}years old, possibly     
 established after the Dissolution. A  
 pump commemorates the Palmers of      
 Withcote who once owned the village.  </content>
