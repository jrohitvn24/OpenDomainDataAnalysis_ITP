		<title>04 THE ABBERD BROOK - CALNE</title>
		<content> The brook in Calne is a bit of a mess 
 but we have ducks and ducklings in    
 there. People push trolleys in the    
 brook and scatter rubbish in the      
 streets which go into the brook and   
 make a mess. There is foam in the     
 brook, it makes it look very untidy   
 and the water looks so murky. Stinging
 nettles are growing all around the    
 brook. There are little minnows       
 darting about and people fish in the  
 brook but don't catch much. There are 
 some chemicals in the water. I think  
 that is what is making foam in the    
 brook. Sometimes in summer a swan     
 comes to the brook. I don't know why. 
 The baby ducks have grown but some    
 eggs get stolen.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
