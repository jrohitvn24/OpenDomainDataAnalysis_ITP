		<title>13The Henley Mayfair</title>
		<content>We interviewed Mrs. Day, she told us   
about the Henley Mayfair. It was her   
idea, it first came into her head when 
she was on top of St. Mary's Church    
tower in 1974. At the time she was     
Mayor of Henley. The fair started in   
1975. It wasn't hard to organise but it
took a long time.                      
The organisation begins in November of 
the previous year. She doesn't get paid
because she does it voluntarily. Mrs.  
Day has been organising the May Fair   
for 11 years and her last year was 1985
.Mrs. Day has tried to think of new    
ideas but she couldn't so she is giving
the job to someone else.               
   She says the town is the best place 
to have it. The best year, she says,   
was the first year because everyone    
dressed in Elizabethan costume. She    
hopes the May fair will carry on for   
much longer bringing new ideas.        </content>
