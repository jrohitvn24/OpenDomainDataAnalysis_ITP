		<content>Gislingham Parish Church has been      
closed for repairs for several months. 
Services are held in the Village Hall. 
The Rector has three other churches in 
his group and lives a few miles away.  
Some children attend Sunday School.    
There is a Methodist Chapel in the     
village but Roman Catholics and others 
have to travel some miles to places of 
worship.
