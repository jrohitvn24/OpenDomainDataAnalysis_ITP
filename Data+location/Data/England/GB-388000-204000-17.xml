		<content> A hundred years ago there were three  
 pubs. One called the Red Lion had a   
 large statue of a red lion over its   
 doorway (which still exists), and was 
 supposed to get down for its dinner   
 when the Baptist church clock struck  
 twelve. For a period in the late 19th 
 century there were two rival schools, 
 supported by the Church of England and
 the Baptist Chapel which had political
 associations. The Liberal supporters  
 were the largest in numbers having    
 working traditions and thus had a     
 bigger chapel and school.  The present
 primary school is housed in the       
 Baptist premises.  The two schools    
 combined in 1919 when school teachers 
 were in short supply due to World War1
 Travel used to be by donkey and trap  
 or walk.  Today most people travel by 
 car.  There is a limited bus service  
 of one per day going in and out.      </content>
