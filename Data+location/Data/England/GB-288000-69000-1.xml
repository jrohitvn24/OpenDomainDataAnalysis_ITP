		<content> Thousands of summer visitors are      
 familiar with the holiday delights of 
 Torquay and probably the legendary    
 traffic chaos of Newton Abbot but     
 tucked away a mere three miles from   
 both these well known towns are the   
 twin villages of Stokeinteignhead and 
 Combeinteignhead together with the    
 smaller hamlets of Netherton and      
 Haccombe. Occasional visitors do brave
 the narrow lanes to savour the        
 atmosphere of the Church House Inn,   
 Stoke; the Wild Goose, Combe; or even 
 the Combe Cellars, prominent on the   
 south bank of the River Teign and     
 clearly seen by passengers travelling 
 on the railway which runs along the   
 northern bank. From the school        
 playground at Stokeinteignhead one can
 clearly hear the HST's racing along   
 the Teign valley.
