 a hill above{Shepshed.}It has been the
 focal point of the village since the  
{11th century}and today still plays an 
 important role. It is built of local  
{Charnwood}stone as are many houses.In 
 the high banked cemetery,where graves 
 lay one on another,is a unique        
 tombstone.It commemorates the death of
 one George Dakin either in January    
 1751 or 1752.The confusion was due to 
 the changing of the calendar at the   
 start of the year.Many of the church  
 plaques are dedicated to the Phillipps
 family who owned the Lordships of     
{Garendon.}Their "lease of the Shepshed
 parsonage" ended when their           
 allegiance changed to the Catholic    
 church and their names changed to{de  
{Lisle.
