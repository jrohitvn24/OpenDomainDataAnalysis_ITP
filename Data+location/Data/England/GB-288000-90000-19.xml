		<title>19ST.THOMAS LEISURE CENTRE.</title>
		<content> St. Thomas station is famous because  
 it was designed by I.K.Brunel.They    
 hope more trains will come to         
 St.Thomas because they are building a 
 new leisure centre.There is going to  
 be a kidney shaped fun pool,with a    
 wave machine and 2 water chutes,an    
 artificial beach, gym,5 squash courts,
 8 snooker tables,4 badminton courts,a 
 bar,a restaurant &amp; other amenities.   
 There will also be a new library. When
 the new library is built a computer   
 will issue the tickets,and we will not
 use our orange cards,but a plastic    
 ticket to go in the computer.         
 When they were digging the site they  
 found an old bell foundry which made a
 bell for Bristol cathedral.The leisure
 centre is being built by Rush &amp; Tomkin
 There is going to be a large Sainsbury
 &amp; 2 small shops.
