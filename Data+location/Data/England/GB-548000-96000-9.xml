     The day starts noisily at about   
 7am. with the post,children,a dog and 
 a cat landing simultaneously on our   
 bed.The radio news is absorbed between
 bathing and dressing,and breakfast is 
 simply toast or cereal and coffee.    
 Sunday breakfast is the only leisurely
 start to a day,excepting weekends when
 father is working.                    
     I take 'phone calls from the      
 surgery from 8am. onwards.This may    
 include sorting out urgent problems or
 passing messages;frequently with a    
 mouthful of toast!I try to be at the  
 surgery by 8:45 for the patients      
 "Phone In" but this is often prevented
 by requests for home visits before    
 surgery.My wife drives or walks the   
 children to school or,if pressed just 
 points them in the right direction.
