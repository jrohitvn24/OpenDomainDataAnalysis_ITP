		<title>07CRAB WOOD,SPARSHOLT.</title>
		<content>  Crab Wood is in two parts.The        
 east side is a nature reserve of      
 special scientific interest because   
 rare animals such as the Doormouse,   
 White Letter Hairstreak Butterfly and 
 Nightingale live and breed.           
  This woodland dates back to the 16th 
 century,it is called Crab Wood        
 because crab apple trees grow there.  
 There are also very old beech,oak,ash,
 sycamore and yew trees.The tallest    
 tree is about thirty meters high.     
  Crab Wood was privately owned,but now
 it is looked after by the local       
 council,for public use.As Crab Wood is
 a nature reserve people are not       
 allowed to take the animals or pick   
 the flowers,however poachers have been
 caught poaching deer,rabbit and       
 pheasant.
