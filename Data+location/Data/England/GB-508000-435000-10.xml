		<content> There are{five}schools in the area, 3 
 primary (5-9) and 2 Junior High       
 (9-13). The senior children (13-16+)  
 must travel to other parts of the     
 city as the long promised Senior      
 School for the area had not yet       
 being built. This school was top be   
 situated North of the Fordyke stream  
 on the West side of Wawne Road.       
                                       
 Access to the city is via one small   
 road to the South. A country lane to  
 the North passes through Wawne and    
 continues up towards Beveley.         
                                       
 There is neither a police or fire     
 station on this part of the estate,   
 however, because of the limited access
 to the South a small{'emergency'}only 
 road was added in{1985.
