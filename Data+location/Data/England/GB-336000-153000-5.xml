		<content>    ON REACHING THE TOP OF THE SLOPE,IT
IS WELL WORTH THE EFFORT TO MOUNT THE  
ROCKY OUTCROP WHICH FORMS THE SUMMIT   
OF THE HILL.                           
    FOR THOSE WHO TOOK THE HARSHER     
CLIMB TO THE SOUTH,THE ROCKS HAVE BEEN 
SPARSELY COVERED WITH GRASS,LEGUMES AND
THE OCCASIONAL DWARFED GORSE.THERE IS  
LITTLE SOIL ON THIS SLOPE AS IT IS     
SWEPT BY WINDS WHICH CARRY AWAY MOST   
SOIL PARTICLES.                        
    THE PATH ON THE EAST HAS BEEN ON   
SPRINGY TURF AS THE SOIL HAS BUILT UP  
ON THE VALLEY SLOPES AND BOTTOM        
ALLOWING GRASS,BRACKEN AND EVEN A FEW  
DECIDUOUS TREES TO BECOME ESTABLISHED. 
    FROM THE PEAK PATHS FOR THE RIDER  
OR WALKER LEAD TO COMPTON              
HILL,WAVERING DOWN AND THE EASTEN HILLS
OF MENDIP.
