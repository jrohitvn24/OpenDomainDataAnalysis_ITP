		<content> We see cars,most of the time going to 
 Bourne all  others are going to       
 Grantham.Near Grantham there is a     
 trunk road called the A1.It is        
 sometimes called the Great North      
 Road.All the way through Edenham there
 is a thirty miles an hour speed       
 limit.We can see lots of cars from the
 School playground.Sometimes we can see
 family cars and chauffeur driven Rolls
 Royces,Minis and Range Rovers.Farmers 
 drive Land Rovers and mostly          
 Tractors.In Summer we see cars pulling
 Caravans going on holiday.Some        
 Caravans  are just going and others   
 are just coming back.Some people take 
 the bus so they can go shopping,go to 
 work or going on a School outing.We   
 see Army trucks go by.The soldiers are
 learning to drive an Army truck.The   
 Army base is in Grantham.Some of the  
 Army vehicles go by are School.       </content>
