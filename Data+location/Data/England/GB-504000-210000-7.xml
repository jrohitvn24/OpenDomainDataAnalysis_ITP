		<title>07The Hunt</title>
		<content> When I went swimming on Saturday      
 morning I saw a man come out          
 of the wood. In his hand he was       
 holding a fox. Then he blew his horn  
 and a load of ladies and men came to  
 the man. I was thinking, the poor fox.

 The local hunt is the{Aldenham        
{Harriers,}which began 110 years ago in
 Aldenham .They do not walk on foot but
 ride on horseback. There are between  
 30-50 members, and at least 40        
 harrier hounds which are kept at Lady 
 Lyall's. Old and young dogs train     
 together. They hunt twice a week from 
 the middle of October to the middle of
 March. They hunt as far as St.Albans  
 and Hitchin, and Ashridge and Barton  
 LeClay.There are two Masters of       
 the hunt. They hunt hares and         
 sometimes a fox. Oddly, hares are     
 increasing in numbers.                </content>
