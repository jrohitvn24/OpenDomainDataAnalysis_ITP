    The Decoy Pool is quite big.If     
 you look at the map it is directly    
 at the end of a track.I estimated the 
 circumference at five hundred yards.It
 looked as if it was a{shooting pool}as
 there were no signs of breeding.The   
 pool and banks were heavily           
 overgrown,and did not seem to have    
 been used for quite some time.There   
 were many trees surrounding it and    
 some had been cut into firewood.There 
 was a single plank for a bridge.It    
 looked to me as if it was dis-used.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
