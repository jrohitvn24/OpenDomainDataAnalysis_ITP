		<content> There is a very large amount of land  
 available for recreation which is     
 varied in size and nature. At national
 and international level are Lancashire
 Cricket Club and Manchester United    
 AFC, both of which are in Old         
 Trafford. Also of national reputation 
 is Stretford Stadium which has        
 facilities for all kinds of athletics.
 There are many small private clubs    
 such as Chorlton Cricket Club and Old 
 Hulmeians Lacrosse. The Hardy Farm    
 site provides extensive playing fields
 for UMIST. Chorlton park and Longford 
 Park provide public open space and    
 tennis courts, bowling gteens and play
 areas. Finally there are larger areas 
 of public open space, many with       
 football pitches for general use.
