		<title>04HOUSING IN EGERTON</title>
		<content>   Whilst there are isolated farm      
 houses, the main residential area is  
 Egerton. Until 20 years ago the       
 village consisted of stone, mill      
 workers cottages built on either side 
 of the Bolton-Blackburn road, with    
 mill owners halls behind.The latter   
 have disappeared giving way to        
 numerous estates of brick housing.    
   The housing is entirely privately   
 owned, and cost between Â£30,000 and   
 Â£80,000.Villagers are totally opposed 
 to further development.               
   40% of the houses are detached, 40% 
 are semi-detached, with 20%,          
 principally older properties being    
 terraced.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
