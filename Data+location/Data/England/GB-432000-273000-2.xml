		<title>02THE LUNT FORT, BAGINTON</title>
		<content> This Roman, peace-keeping and cavalry 
 training installation dating back to  
 the 1st century A.D.was discovered in 
 1960 by Brian Stanley. It is unique in
 the Roman world having the only Gyrus,
 a cavalry training ring.              
 Reconstruction work was begun in 1960 
 and still continues today, under the  
 supervision of Coventry Museum with   
 labour provided by the Royal Engineers
 and the Manpower Services Commission. 
 To date, a substantial section of the 
 rampart, together with the gateway,   
 granary and gyrus have been built,    
 mainly fron oak timbers, and plans are
 already waiting for future work on the
 Principia.                            
 The fort is open regularly to the     
 publis and provides and informative   
 and enjoyable insight into the life of
 the Roman soldier with lifesize models
 of Legionaries and Auxiliaries.       </content>
