 It was once three cottages, one had   
 two small bedrooms, a back kitchen,a  
 W.C. and two small gardens.It was let 
 to Clutton  R.D.C. at Â£6 10s 0d       
 per annum. The other two were the same
 but had a front room and washhouse as 
 well.They were let to Mr.J.W.Flower at
 Â£13 4s. 4d per annum. One had a spiral
 staircase, a small bread oven and a   
 alcove. The bathroom and shed were not
 built then but were built in Victorian
 times.

 I live at 17, Valley View. My house is
 quite new. It was built in the 1960's.
 Before it was built the ground was    
 allotments. My house has 3 bedrooms   
 and 1 bathroom upstairs and downstairs

 been extended.                        </content>
