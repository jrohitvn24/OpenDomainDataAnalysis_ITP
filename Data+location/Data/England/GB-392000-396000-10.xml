		<title>10HOUSING AROUND AUDENSHAW(2)</title>
		<content>   There is old peoples' sheltered     
{bungalow}accommodation close to the   
 council estate.                       
   Three small streets with{terraced   
 houses with back yards compose the    
{terraced}type of dwellings but these  
 have a dense red brick facia which    
 gives them a superior look to the     
 normal type of common brick found     
 outside this area. These three streets
 are located close to what was once a  
 large engineering works which has been
 demolished.                           
   Audenshaw is sandwiched between two 
 main roads in which shops are located.
 A small shopping precinct including a 
 post office supplies some of the      
 requirements of local shoppers.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
