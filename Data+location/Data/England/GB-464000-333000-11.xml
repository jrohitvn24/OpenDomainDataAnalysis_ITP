		<content> Some years ago the cross was at the   
 centre of Cotgrave.This is where the  
 roads to                              
 Nottingham,Plumtree,Stragglethorpe,Cro
 pwell Bishop and Colston Bassett all  
 lead.Around the cross are the         
 church,the village school,the post    
 office,shop,two public houses and a   
 garage.People could walk along the    
 road in those days because there was  
 very little traffic.Cars were         
 expensive and only very rich people   
 could afford them.Up until late in the
  nineteenth century the drains of the 
 village were all open and ran into    
 each other at the cross.There used to 
 be a cart bridge for carts to cross   
 over them.Now,the roads are very      
 busy.Although people wrote about the  
 cross,we do not know what the old     
 cross  looked like.
