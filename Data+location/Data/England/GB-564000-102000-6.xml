		<content> Mr Stiff is{a retired pharmacist}and  
 he and his wife moved to be near his  
 family.The Stiffs live in a three     
 bedroomed house with a fairly large   
 back garden .In the front is a smaller
 garden with a pond. Sometimes herons  
 eat the goldfish in this pond. There  
 is one main living room with dining   
 room and a conservatory.The kitchen is
 a moderate size and Mrs Stiff cooks by
 electricity .The conservatory is a    
 play area for the grand children.There
 is a lavatory in both storeys.The     
 house is  comfortably furnished with  
 family ornaments and Mr Stiff has     
 photos of his father's saddlers shop. 
 This couple enjoy living in the Bay   
 and think that local shopping is      
 good.In nearby Eastbourne are many    
 amenities.The Stiffs own and drive a  
 car at present but say that public    
 transport is poor.                    </content>
