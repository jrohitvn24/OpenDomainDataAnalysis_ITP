		<title>17The Gospel Hall,Helions.</title>
		<content> This is a small chapel for worship    
 situated between Helions Bumpstead    
 Village centre and Pale Green. It is  
 run by the{Plymouth Brethren.}The     
 Gospel Hall is 100 years old. It is   
 called the Gospel Hall because they   
 teach people about gospels. They used 
 to have Sunday School but they found  
 so many people went out on Sundays    
 that they replaced it by{Treasure     
{seekers}on Thursdays.John Frost       
 thought of the name Treasure seekers. 
 It is run by the{Ramseys}and some of  
 the{Cornells.}The Cornell family have 
 now gone to Brazil to teach people    
 about God. At Treasure seekers they   
 have songs, quizzes, bible stories.   
 They give stickers out every week, and
 every so often we have a swap shop    
 when we can exchange our stickers for 
 little presents.Every year we have a  
 trip to the seaside.                  </content>
