		<title>08GRAVEL PITS</title>
		<content>   There are{6 gravel pits}in our      
 patch,three near Chadwell,two near    
 West Tilbury,and one near Linford.The 
 one near Linford is very large and    
 covers an awful lot of land,about     
 0.5-0.75 of a square mile.The gravel  
 in the pits is used for making        
 roads,cement etc.When used for making 
 cement the gravel is mixed into the   
 ballast.Gravel comes in all shapes and
 sizes,the smallest is{10mm}in         
 diameter then{20mm then 40mm}then     
 75mm.The 20mm stone is the most       
 commonly used of the four sizes.The   
 big pit at Linford is used by most    
 local sand and gravel merchants.There 
 are also two small{clay pits}in our   
 patch,they are each side of the pit   
 east of West Tilbury.There is a lot of
 clay in the mud at Tilbury so they are
 expanding all the time.
