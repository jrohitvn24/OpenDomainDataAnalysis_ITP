		<title>03BRADWELL VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{*}I think it is a very quiet place.The
 main road makes Braintree and         
 Colchester easily accessible.Bradwell 
 is divided into two small villages,the
 new village,where there is the village
 shop,pub and playing field,and Perry  
 Green,the old village,consisting of   
 several farmhouses.                   
{*}Two new houses are being built in   
 Bradwell.I don't think people mind    
 because there used to be a pig farm   
 there and I think that people would   
 rather look at houses than pigs.A few 
 men in the village have jobs on the   
 site building them or plumbing and    
 plastering.                           
{*}If you pass through the village past
 the church you find a gravel pit owned
 by the Associated Roadstone Company.  
 They have a private road half-way     
 between the pit and the village so the
 lorries do not really bother us.      </content>
