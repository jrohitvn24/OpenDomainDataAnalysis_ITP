		<title>01The Town Of Dent</title>
		<content>   Dent is now a village but in the    
 past it was a very busy trading town. 
 The village is situated to the west of
 the Yorkshire Dales,yet it is unique  
 in the fact that it is also in the    
 Diocese of Bradford and in the County 
 of Cumbria.Anyone wishing to visit    
 Dent would find that travelling from  
 the South of England they would leave 
 the M6 Motorway at junction 37,go     
 towards Sedbergh,turn right for 5.75  
 miles to find Dent.                   
    The visitor would be delighted to  
 find this beautiful village hidden    
 between the fells,with its cobbled    
 street,stone built houses, Norman     
 church,the river Dee with its         
 limestone pavement bottom,all mixed   
 with history and intrigue.            
      Dentdale is a farming area with  
 magnetic appeal to both locals and    
 incomers who appreciate the arts.     </content>
