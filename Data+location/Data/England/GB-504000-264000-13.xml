		<content> The Post Office is situated at 1 Green
 Lane and has been run by the present  
 postmistress for the last 4 years. It 
 serves the whole of the village.      
 Anything from a stamp to a postal     
 order, pay your TV licence or cash    
 your unemployment benefit can be      
 transacted here.                      
 The post itself is delivered by       
 another lady who manages to get round 
 the whole village with letters and    
 parcels come rain or shine.           
 The Five Bells Public House is        
 situated in the High Street. Here you 
 can get anything from a pint of beer  
 to a meal in the pubs restaurant. It  
 also has a room which can be hired out
 for private functions. All the beer   
 served at the pub is Charles Wells,   
 which is brewed in Bedford.
