		<content>    The area of our survey is a rural  
 landscape, basically comprising of two
 main communities the villages of{Roxby
 and{Appleby.}The rest scattered with  
 isolated farm houses and the small    
 hamlet of{High and Low Risby.         
   The farming workforce is now very   
 small and only a small percentage are 
 employed on the local farms. The      
 majority of residents travelling to   
 nearby towns and further a field for  
 their employment. The{amenities}for   
 the area are very few. The advent of  
 the motor car has led to a reduction  
 in bus services and shops. Now the two
 communities have niether a post office
 or school. The land is mostly under   
 cultivation for cereals, peas, beans, 
 sugar beet, oil seed rape and straw_  
 berries.{Mining susidence}from disused
 iron-ore mines has proved a problem in
 th 80's with areas now fenced off.    </content>
