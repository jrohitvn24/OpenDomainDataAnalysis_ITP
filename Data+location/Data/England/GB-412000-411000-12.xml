		<title>12HOLME VALLEY INDUSTRY - 2</title>
		<content>   The years since World War Two have  
 seen a rapid{decline in the wool      
{textile industry.}Reasons for this    
 include the increased use of man made 
 fibres and cheaper foreign imports.   
 There is much evidence of this decline
 in the valley. Some mills lie empty   
 and others have been demolished. Some 
 however, have been re-occupied by new 
 industries. Two of the larger examples
 of this, in Brockholes and Honley     
 respectively, are{electric motor}and  
{soft drinks}production.               
   There are also two examples of the  
 current trend towards small businesses
 housed in{factory or workshop 'units'.
 In Honley these are in old converted  
 mills. In Brockholes a small estate of
 units is under construction (July 85) 
 on the site of a cleared textile mill.
