		<title>07The Blackwell Influence</title>
		<content>  Mr. and Mrs. Nigel Blackwell live at 
the Grange next to the Church.  Other  
members of the famous publishing family
live in the area.  They bought the     
Manor House in a state of disrepair and
completely restored it.                
  Fyfield Manor c.1320, with its       
beautiful solar room has housed        
Blackwells Rare Books Department for   
the past six years.  There is a staff  
of thirteen who live within a twenty   
mile radius.  Swift is reputed to have 
stayed there and derived the name      
Gulliver from Golafre.  It houses about
20,000 volumes (18,000 rare, 2,000     
reference).                            
  A modern presses section includes    
small handmade editions and first      
editions by famous authors.  Many are  
sold abroad by mail order and the Manor
attracts distinguished foreign         
visitors and locals are always welcome.</content>
