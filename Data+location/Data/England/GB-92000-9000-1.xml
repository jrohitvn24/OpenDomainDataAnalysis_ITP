		<title>01General Summary.</title>
		<content>      This part of St. Mary's is quiet 
 and peaceful with no industrial       
 development. It is renown for its'    
 natural beauty and temperate climate. 
 It is ideal for the tourist who seeks 
 relaxation and is often referred to as
 the Fortunate or Friendly Isles. There
 are superb coastal footpaths leading  
 torocky  headlands  and small coves   
 pllus anature trail which folllows a  
 stream to Porth Hellick Pool. The     
 island is a favourite with            
 birdwatchers who come to see the      
 seabirds and rare migrants whidh pass 
 through here in spring and autumn. The
 mild climate enables the farmers to   
 produce early flowers of the daffodil 
 variety in small fields with high     
 hedges of pittisporam for protection. 
 Fishing is also an important part of  
 the economy,particularly for shellfish
 although there are a few trawlers.    </content>
