		<title>20Sudbury's Market</title>
		<content>  Sudbury has had a market since Saxon 
times but its site moved from Stour    
Street to its present position on      
Market Hill in the Middle Ages. Market 
Hill is the centre of the modern town  
and there are two market days per week,
Thursday and Saturday where a variety  
of goods are sold from stalls.         
  There is a livestock market situated 
in Burkitts Lane. This used to be the  
most important part of the market but  
it could close down next year because  
it has few customers. There is a       
flourishing second hand market on the  
same site which will remain.
