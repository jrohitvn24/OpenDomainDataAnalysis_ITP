		<title>03Population of Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> In  1801  Saxilby  had a population of
 309. The increasing importance of  the
 canal  as  a communication link , plus
 the railway, caused the population  to
 nearly  treble by 1850. The opening of
 2 engineering works in the early years
 of  the  20th  century   brought   the
 population  steadily  to 1636 by 1961.
 Subsequent  growth   has   given   the
 village   importance  as  a  dormitory
 settlement for Lincoln increasing  the
 population  to its present approximate
 3200  people  including  Ingleby.  The
 population  of  Broxholme is around 50
 including 8 children. Saxilby  appeals
 to  young  couples moving on in 2 or 3
 years due to job changes and  also  to
 RAF  families,  so there is a constant
 trickle of new blood in and out of the
 village. Despite  this,  school  rolls
 are  falling  and  the  elderly form a
 high proportion of the inhabitants.   </content>
