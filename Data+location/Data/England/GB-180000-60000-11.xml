		<title>11Farming In The Newquay Area</title>
		<content>    The farms in the area have recently
 been amalgamated into bigger units,and
 paddock grazing has  been introduced. 
 Farms have become specialised in order
 to produce food at competitive prices.
                                       
    Dairying is the most profitable in 
 the area,the main breed being Fresian.
 Most milk is sent to the dairy at     
 Lostwithiel and some to the cheese    
 factory at Davidstow.                 
                                       
    Pigs are kept on 40% of the farms- 
 they provide an additional source of  
 income without using much land.       
                                       
    Sheep are kept on large farms as   
 they need a large range.The main breed
 is the South Devon.Lambs are the main 
 source of revenue:this area produces  
 the earliest lambs in the country     
 because of the mild winter weather.   </content>
