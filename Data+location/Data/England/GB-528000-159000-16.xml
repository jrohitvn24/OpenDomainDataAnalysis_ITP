		<title>16Purley Hospital</title>
		<content>   Purley hospital was originally built
 in 1909 but the new building called   
 the Memorial Hospital was built during
 the Second World War in 1940.         
   Nowadays it is a unit caring mainly 
 for the elderly although some of the  
 57 beds are for medical cases.        
   The wards are small with 8 or 10    
 beds in each and a few single rooms.  
   The atmosphere is homely and often a
 husband or wife of an elderly patient 
 will be allowed to stay in the        
 hospital even if he or she is not     
 ill, just to keep each other company. 
   The hospital runs many clinics      
 including chest, chiropody and        
 diabetic but it no longer carries out 
 surgical operations.                  
   It has a part-time casualty         
 department but does not run its own   
 ambulances. It is run by the National 
 Health Service.                       </content>
