		<content> We interviewed several people from the
 community to find out how they felt   
 about living in Woodmancote and what  
 sort of work they did.                
                                       
{Mrs.J.Williams }is a native of        
 Woodmancote and still lives in the    
 house she was born in; the house built
 by her father from local stone.       
   She remembers when the village was  
 much smaller and she knew everyone in 
 it.Now she sometimes gets lost among  
 all the new houses.She still enjoys   
 living here but does not think the    
 sense of community is as strong.      
 (Mrs.Williams is caretaker at the     
 Primary school).                      
                                       
{Mrs.J.Macpherson-Rait }on the other   
 hand is a very newcomer.Originally    
 from Scotland,she has recently moved  
 in from Cornwall.  (cont.on next page)</content>
