		<title>19Edgcott Cottages, Exford</title>
		<content> 2 Edgcott Cottage was built in 1841   
 by Thomas Pearce.In the late 1800's it
 was a grocers shop. The next door     
 cottage was East Edgcott Homestead    
 Farm. This was the butchers shop and  
 animals for slaughtering were kept in 
 the field behind called Butchers      
 Field. The slaughtering was done in   
 the barn next door.We bought 2 Edgcott
 in 1981 which we modernised,Many      
 cottages on Exmoor are modernised and 
 sold for holiday homes.Our cottage was
 built with the field halfway up the   
 side of the wall, this made it very   
 damp. We overcame this by purchasing a
 strip of the field next door which was
 excavated making our driveway and     
 entrance to our back door. The old    
 Kitchen and bathroom were demolished  
 and new ones built.This has resulted  
 in a much improved cottage.
