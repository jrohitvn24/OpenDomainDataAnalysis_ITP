 HAD TO USE THE PAPER SHOP ON HIGHFIELD
 ROAD. ITS REALLY QUIET ROUND NEWBURY  
 WAY EXCEPT FOR THE ALARM AT THE OLD   
 MILL GOING OFF EVERYDAY WITH PEOPLE   
 THROWING STONES AT THE WINDOWS,PEOPLE 
 BREAKING IN,AND FIRES AT THE BACK OF  
 IT.THE PETROL STATION IS NEXT DOOR TO 
 THE MILL.THERE ARE CARS COMING IN     
 EVERY-DAY THAT HAVE HAD A CRASH.AT    
 NIGHT YOU CAN HARDLY GET TO SLEEP     
 BECAUSE OF THE RESCUE CARS COMING IN  
 WITH WRECKS AND PIECES OF CARS.AT THE 
 BACK OF MY HOUSE IS A FIELD. AT THE   
 END OF THE FIELD IS A STREET CALLED   
 GORTON STREET ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AGO    
 THEY KNOCKED IT DOWN. ALL THERE IS NOW
 IS BRICKS,RUBBLE AND DIRT.ON THE FIELD
 AT THE SIDE OF MY HOUSE THERE ARE     
 GAMES PLAYED EVERYDAY WITH FOOTBALL   
 MATCHES AND ROUNDERS MATCHES.
