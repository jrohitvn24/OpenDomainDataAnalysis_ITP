		<content> My name is Adam Trentham and I am ten 
 years old.                            
        I like playing football with   
 the big lads.There are some playing   
 fields up by the woods.               
              I also like playing "Fox 
 and Hounds"on bikes.What you do is ,if
 there are twelve people playing six   
 run and six stay.The six that stay    
 count to one hundred and then have to 
 find the other six.                   
            I also like taking my bike 
 to the B.M.X. track at Senneleys      
 Park.It is not finished yet but it    
 will be soon.The track has camel      
 humps,jumps and a freestyle ramp.It   
 has a gravel and sand surface.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
