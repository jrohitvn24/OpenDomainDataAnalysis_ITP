		<title>09WENNINGTON - SOCIAL COHESION</title>
		<content> While the village school in Wennington
 was in operation the people saw more  
 of each other as they took their      
 children to and from school, but once 
 the school closed in 1967 the main    
 social pressure which had persuaded   
 outsiders to become involved in the   
 community was removed and most of the 
 locals only see each other regularly  
 at church services. The church is     
 described as a socially cohesive force
 bringing scattered neighbours         
 together. However, few social events  
 are organised by the church. Tatham   
 Sports Day was a big social occasion  
 while the school was open; although it
 still exists it has ceased to have the
 same effect as earlier. Even Lower    
 Tatham Council is felt to do little to
 try and create a sense of community.
