		<title>04Wotter ecology</title>
		<content> Most of the higher ground is divided  
 into small grass fields by Devon      
 banks,but a patch to the north east is
 wild moorland and derelict china clay 
 tips onto which moorland vegetation   
 has encroched.                        
 Besides tough grasses rushes and      
 bracken there is some heather and     
 whortleberry.                         
 Near Wotter there are very few trees  
 exept for a group of Scots pines and  
 hawthorn.                             
 Southwest winds bring rain often with 
 a cloud base below the village.       
 There is no shelter from the cold east
 winds and little from from the north. 
 The combined effect of these weather  
 conditions is deterrent to gardening. 
 Bickleigh is much lower and more      
 sheltered and has both and good       
 gardens.
