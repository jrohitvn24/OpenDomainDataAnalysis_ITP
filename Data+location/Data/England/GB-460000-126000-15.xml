		<content> 53%of the adult population go outside 
 the home to work, of these            
 approximately half commute outside the
 village.  32%of the adult population  
 are housewives or students, a few of  
 whom work part time.  15% of the adult
 population are retired, and 18% of the
 total population are children.  The   
 village church remains a centre of    
 interest as well as worship; many of  
 the village events are organised by   
 parishioners.  Households of 2 or less
 tend to use the village shop for all  
 general food purchases.  Larger       
 households tend to go outside the area
 for these requirements and only use   
 the village stores for occasional     
 purchases.  The services of the post  
 office are used by all villagers.  The
 village pub is well patronised by     
 local people; it also has a good      
 passing trade.                        </content>
