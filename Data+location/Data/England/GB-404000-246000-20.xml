		<title>20Maypole Dancing at Offenham.</title>
		<content>  Maypole dancing takes place          
 in Offenham on {Wake Day},which is an 
 annual event.Children from the village
 rehearse the dancing for about six    
 weeks.Rehearsals usually last about an
 hour.At the first rehearsal we choose 
 our ribbon colour.There are four      
 colours red,green,blue,and white.Then 
 we have to learn the dances,which     
 involve making patterns with the      
 ribbons,whilst skipping around the    
 Maypole.The week before the Wake we   
 collect our skirts,which match the    
 colour of the ribbons.We also wear    
 a white blouse,socks and pumps.There  
 are lots of dances.We begin with the  
 entrance dance and then do other      
 dances including the gypsy tent,and   
 then we finish with the exit.I feel   
 very nervous to start with,but when   
 the music begins I enjoy it all.
