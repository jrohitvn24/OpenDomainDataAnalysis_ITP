		<content>Newcastle-under-Lyme was granted its   
first charter by Henry II in 1173 and, 
with protection from the new castle    
from which its name comes, the town    
became the main route and market centre
in North Staffordshire. Only a short,  
low section of wall from that castle   
remains.                               
During the nineteenth century the towns
of the nearby Potteries grew more      
rapidly. In 1910 the six separate towns
of the Potteries joined a Federation   
and in 1925 this Federation of towns   
was granted the status of city by King 
George V.                              
Newcastle-under-Lyme stoutly defends   
its independence from its larger       
neighbour although visitors to the area
may not always be able to recognise    
where one ends and the other begins.   
They compete for new industries .
