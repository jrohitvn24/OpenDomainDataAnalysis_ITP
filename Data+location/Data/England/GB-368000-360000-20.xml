		<title>20Hopes for the Future</title>
		<content> As an {adult}with children of my own, 
 my hope is for a world free of war,fam
 ine,pestilence and fear.I long,also,fo
 r a world where the balance of nature 
 is restored and pollution is a thing  
 of the past.A{Child's view}of the futu
 re depends,to a large degree,upon the 
 individual's age;the younger the child
 ,the more materialistic are its hopes 
 and aspirations.However,the older chil
 dren have a wider aspect,thanks no dou
 bt to the influence of television.They
 are all concerned about the plight of 
 those more unfortunate than themselves
 ,such as those who are starving abroad
 and those who are suffering from man  
 made and natural disasters.They hope  
 for a world where there is food and   
 shelter for all,full employment,peace,
 prosperity,happiness,unpolluted countr
 yside and wides spread computerisation
 .Polticians are not popular.          </content>
