		<content> Bournemouth is a seaside town on the  
 south coast of England in the county  
 of Dorset.It is a holiday and         
 residential town with a population of 
 over 150,000 people.                  
 Bournemouth is a modern town,a late   
 developer which became fashionable    
 more recently than many of its rivals.
 In fact,less than two  centuries ago  
 the area was nothing but a solitary   
 stretch of sheltered dunes bordered by
 sandstone cliffs,and where smuggling  
 was rife.                             
 It is said that Captain Lewis         
 Tregonwell is the founder of          
 Bournemouth. Bourneouth, now has miles
 and miles of clean sandy beaches and  
 the bay is sheltered by the Purbeck   
 hills to the west and Hengistbury Head
 to the east.
