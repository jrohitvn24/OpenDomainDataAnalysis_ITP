		<title>04Ghost at the White Hart Inn.</title>
		<content> John Ferney staggered up the stairs of
 the White Hart Inn, clinging to the   
 banisters and singing drunken         
 songs.This was the result of consuming
 five pints of beer at the tavern. He  
 finally reached the top and lay       
 exhausted for a full ten minutes. Then
 he crawled along the landing, turned  
 the knob of his door and crashed out  
 on his four-poster where he fell      
 asleep almost immediately.            
 He awoke with his flesh creeping. The 
 room felt strangely cold and the      
 blackness was so dense that he could  
 not see his hand in front of his      
 face. For a moment he thought he      
 heard an eerie moan which made the    
 skin on his back prickle. Imagination,
 he thought. It must be. Suddenly he   
 felt the bedclothes being ripped off  
 him. He screamed,as he saw bright     
 lights whizzing round him.            </content>
