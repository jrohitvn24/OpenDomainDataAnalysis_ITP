		<title>03THE EARL OF LICHFIELD</title>
		<content>  Shugborough is the home of the Earl  
of Lichfield,his wife Lady Leonora and 
their three children.   Lord Lichfield 
only attends the State Opening of      
Parliament,but in later years hopes to 
have time for Parliamentary debates.   
  He is a professional photographer and
his work takes him abroad regularly.   
Last year he travelled 380,000 miles by
air.  Lady Leonora is a Lady-in-Waiting
to Princess Anne.                      
  Life has changed dramatically since  
Lord Lichfield's youth at Shugborough  
when the Anson family had 39 indoor    
and 70 outdoor staff.  Now they employ 
a couple to maintain their private     
quarters with a few cleaning staff.    
  He and his sister had to spend school
holidays working as "understudy" to    
each servant in turn.  This gave them a
greater understanding of the servants' 
work and feelings.                     </content>
