		<content> The village shop is the post office   
 and a general store.It is owned by    
 Mrs.Vera Wardle and she has been there
 for fourteen years.                   
    It is very hard to keep village sh-
 ops open and many are closing down.Mrs
 Wardle isn't sure how much longer she 
 will be able to keep the shop open.   
    The problem really is the big sup- 
 ermarkets in places like Penrith,App- 
 leby and Carlisle.These big stores can
 by things more cheaply and keep their 
 prices low.Mrs.Wardle cannot by in    
 bulk and so cannot keep her prises    
 low.People in the village with cars   
 can go to the big supermarkets and on-
 ly buy things that they forget from   
 her shop.                             
    The butchers which opens for just a
 few hours each day in a converted barn
 and the village shop are the only ones
 in our block.                         </content>
