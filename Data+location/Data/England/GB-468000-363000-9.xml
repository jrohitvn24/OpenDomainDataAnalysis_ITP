		<title>09THE NEWSHEET OF KNEESALL,2</title>
		<content> In the most recent edition of the     
 village newsheet,they have put an item
 about the{Domesday Project}and what   
 Kneesall School are contributing.A    
 typical list of items for each month's
 copy might include a religious        
 article, news about the village       
 fete,prizewinners in the village      
 competitions  and forthcoming social  
 events.                               
  Mrs Ricket types the carbon sheets   
 each month. She types quickly and then
 the sheets are duplicated. Later,the  
 finished newsheet is distributed  from
 house to house in {Kneesall, Kersall  
{and Ompton }while a single copy is    
 sent to the churches in the           
 neighbouring villages. The newsheet is
 very interesting and has lots of      
 variety.The editors  of the Kneesall  
 Knatter certainly make it very        
 lively.                               </content>
