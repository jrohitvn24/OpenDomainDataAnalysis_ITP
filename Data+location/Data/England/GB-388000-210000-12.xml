		<content> Councillors could not prevent the     
 Planning Committee from allowing the  
 Croft Field houses.Most villagers     
 think that the houses will damage the 
 village. The Parish Councillor said,  
 "The outcome is probably the worst    
 single thing that has ever happened to
 the village in planning terms. The    
 houses were advertised as executive   
 homesand the developers set out to    
 attract urban customers. This is      
 probably the first time this had been 
 done and will hasten the decline of   
 the balanced rural community".Some    
 people think that if young children   
 come to the houses it may help the    
 school. People want smaller, cheaper  
 houses, built either singly or in     
 small groups. The Planning            
 Officer agreed that homes for the     
 young and elderly,so releasing houses 
 for families, would be right.         </content>
