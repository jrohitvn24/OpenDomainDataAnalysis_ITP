		<title>04The Town Leat-NE.of Tiverton</title>
		<content>     There is a stream called the Town 
 Leat which runs through Allers Wood   
 and Chettiscombe into the centre of   
 Tiverton.This stream was given to the 
 people of Tiverton by the Countess    
 Isabella of Devon in 1250.The Countess
 wanted the people of Tiverton to have 
 running water and the stream also     
 filled the moat around Tiverton       
 Castle.                               
     All those years ago people were   
 appointed to patrol the streets to    
 make sure that the water kept         
 flowing.This custom still continues   
 today. Every seven years the          
{"Perambulation of the Leat"}takes     
 place when people from Tiverton walk  
 along the course of the Leat.         
 'Pioneers' lead the way carrying tools
 to clear the Leat. The last           
 Perambulation was in 1983.
