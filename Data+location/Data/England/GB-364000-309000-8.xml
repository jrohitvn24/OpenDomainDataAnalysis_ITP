		<content>   When I went to school as a boy in a 
 Lancashire cotton town we were taught 
 as a class.Very little attention was  
 given to individual needs.The class   
 was judged on its performance as a    
 whole and not as individual children  
 in that class.                        
   The teacher was also judged on the  
 performance of the class.             
   Today,a child's progress is charted 
 carefully throughout his/her time in  
 school.Social needs are considered and
 placed in context with the learning   
 process,so that progress through      
 school is carefully monitored.        
 Relationships between children and    
 teachers have altered tremendously and
 it would be true to say that children 
 today look forward to school more so  
 than twenty years ago.                
   Teachers and  children are partners 
 in the learning process.              </content>
