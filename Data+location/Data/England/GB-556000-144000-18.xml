		<title>18Tonbridge Market</title>
		<content> The market began in the 1300's,it was 
 both a cattle market and a fair. In   
 1850 the cattle market was behind an  
 Inn in Back Lane, now called Bank     
 Street.The last cattle market was on  
 Tuesday the 28th of September 1971.   
 The market is 9.00 am to 4.30 pm but  
 the people who rent the stalls arrive 
 between 5.30 am and 7.00 am and they  
 leave between 5.00 pm and 7.00 pm.    
 Some people make things to sell. There
 are many kinds of stalls. There are   
 stalls for clothes, fruit, vegetables,
 toys,stationery,books, sweets, pets   
 and many other things. There are also 
 mobile snack bars which sell fish and 
 chips, potatoes, ice_creams and       
 hot_dogs. People go to the market     
 because things are often cheaper than 
 in the shops. Tonbridge market may be 
 closed because the council are going  
 to open a Sunday market.              </content>
