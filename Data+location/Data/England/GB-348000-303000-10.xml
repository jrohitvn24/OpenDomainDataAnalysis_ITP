		<title>10THE WORK OF THE VICAR</title>
		<content> Condover Parish is the most northern  
 parish in the Hereford diocese.The    
 Vicar preaches at Pitchford,Acton     
 Burnell,Frodsley and Condover,also a  
 small  mission church at Ryton.Acton  
 Burnell,Frodsley and Pitchford are    
 visited twice a month.Only Condover   
 has services every week.In earlier    
 times each parish had its own vicar,  
 but they are now combined.In addition 
 the Church of England is short of     
 money and can't pay many clergymen.   
 The Vicar has been with this parish   
 approximately one year and has        
 inherited readers and helpers from the
 last incumbent.In general each area   
 parish church is well attended in     
 relation to it's population and       
 congregation which are growing.Each is
 fortunate in having it's own organist.
