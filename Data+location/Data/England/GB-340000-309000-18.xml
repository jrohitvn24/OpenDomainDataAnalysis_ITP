		<title>18LIFE IN NOX.</title>
		<content> The{small hamlet of Nox}is situated on
 the B4386 4 miles west of Shrewsbury. 
 The local people shop at Yockleton,   
 Lea Cross or Shrewsbury and rely on   
 Yockleton for social activities such  
 as Women's Institute, Mothers Union,  
 Young Farmers and the church. The     
 inhabitants find employment on nearby 
 farms, at Butterfly World or further  
 afield in Shrewsbury. A Blacksmith    
 lives and works in{Nox.Services       
 include: refuse collection once a     
 week, milk deliveries and a postal    
 service. Services consist of one      
 delivery and two collections. A mobile
 butcher calls weekly and a Shropshire 
 library van calls every other week.   
 The hamlet is served by a limited bus 
 service. The main issue of concern for
 the inhabitants is the speed of       
 traffic along the B4386.
