		<content> This area is in an interesting        
 position caught between the New Forest
 and the industrial complex which has  
 sprung on the West side of Southampton
 Water. The six westmost blocks are    
 almost entirely heathland consisting  
 of scrub with the occasional tree and 
 wet patch so typical of much of this  
 area. The three East most blocks      
 include parts of the Esso Refinery,the
 biggest installation of its type in   
 the country,and a large residential   
 area which has grown to provide       
 housing and amenities for the workers 
 at the refinery and other associated  
 industries which have grown in its    
 wake. Most of the housing is          
 relatively new although there are a   
 few examples of old foresters cottages
 still to be seen. Indications are that
 this area will continue to grow.
