    The area is divided by the River   
Stour and the Staffordshire and        
Worcestershire Canal which run side by 
side through the broad green valley    
which separates the West Midland       
conurbation from the beautiful hills of
Kinver Edge.                           
    The block is predominantly rural   
and agricultural with a mix of arable  
and  pastoral farming. The main        
settlement is Kinver with a            
population of about 8,000. Half the    
village lies in this block and the     
remainder in the adjacent western      
block. There are two or three more     
villages or hamlets along the river,   
principally Stourton and Whittington.  
    Most people go to work in the towns
of Dudley, Stourbridge, Wolverhampton  
and Birmingham.
