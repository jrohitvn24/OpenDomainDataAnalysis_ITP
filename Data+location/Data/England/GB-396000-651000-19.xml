		<title>19TWEEDMOUTH FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> The Tweedmouth Feast  was started in  
 the 13th century by St.Boisil.It      
 related to the annual festival of the 
 Saint who was patron of Tweedmouth    
 (and a Tutor of St.Cuthbert).         
 The Feast commences with the Crowning 
 of the Salmon Queen at the Jubilee    
 Lamp in Tweedmouth.A procession of the
 Salmon Queen and her attendents starts
 from the Berwick Town Hall. They are  
 transported on a cobble (the          
 traditional salmon fishermans boat)   
 over the Old Bridge to the crowning   
 ceremony.                             
 After the opening of the Feast week   
 many carnival activities take place,  
 during which money is collected to    
 provide Salmon supper for the Senior  
 Citizens of Tweedmouth.Most of the    
 Tweedmouth based companies enter a    
 decorative float which tours the town 
 playing music and collecting money.   </content>
