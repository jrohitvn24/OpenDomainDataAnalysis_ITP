		<title>15LANGFORD BUDVILLE COMMON</title>
		<content> The Common is about 180 square acres  
 and is known as Langton Heathfield.   
 The Somerset Trust for Nature         
 Conservation own and look after this  
 area including all wild life.         
 The deciduous trees that grow there   
 are the ash, oak, silver birch and    
 beech, there are a few evergreen trees
 such as the scots pine. Many different
 animals live there, deer, snakes,     
 squirrels, foxes, mice, rabbits, many 
 birds along with an abundance of      
 insects such as beetles and           
 butterflies.                          
 Every now and again the Trust cut down
 all the braken and ferns to allow new 
 strong growth the following season.   
 Next to the road on an area of grass  
 there is a seat called the Jubilee    
 seat. At the bottom of the Common     
 there used to be a barn ,now in ruins,
 which was once the home of a barn owl.</content>
