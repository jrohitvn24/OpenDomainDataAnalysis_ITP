		<title>19The Winkle Club</title>
		<content> The Winkle Club was started in 1983.It
 was started as a charity to raise     
 money for different things in the     
 village.They bought a P.E.bench for   
 our school and a video.They have given
 Â£200 to the playgroup and paid for the
 Derby and Joan Club to go on a trip.  
 They meet at The Swan pub.The members 
 of the club are all men.There are     
 fifty members.It got its name because 
 every member has a winkle shell with a
 number on it.They raise money by      
 having discos and dances in the pub.
