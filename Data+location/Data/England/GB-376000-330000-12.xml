A District Nurse travels the district  
daily to attend to the elderly and the 
sick.  She also visits mothers and     
babies. The nearest doctor is in Ashley
or Eccleshall; as each doctor dispenses
his or her own prescriptions, there is 
no difficulty about getting medication 
quickly and easily.                    
The nearest Children's Clinic is in    
Eccleshall.  A Meals on Wheels service 
supplies the old people with a daily   
dinner ( the meals are cooked at the   
Women's Prison near Eccleshall).  The  
meals are taken round by local         
volunteers.  This is an valuable check 
on the welfare of the elderly, as they 
get a daily visit.  If necessary the   
appropriate help can be summoned.
