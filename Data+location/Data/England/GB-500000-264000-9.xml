		<title>09Employment in Melchbourne</title>
		<content> Under 50% of households in Melchbourne
 are of working age, most of the       
 residents are over 60 and have        
 retired.                              
 Some people still farm locally, but   
 others travel to London, Bedford and  
 Rushden to work.                      
 There are several craftsmen in the    
 village; a potter, a woodworker, a    
 lady who makes lampshades and a couple
 who knit jumpers to any design or     
 picture you choose.                   
 The occupations of those working out  
 of the village are very varied and    
 include a builder,a solicitor and     
 somebody involved in the blind letter 
 press business.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
