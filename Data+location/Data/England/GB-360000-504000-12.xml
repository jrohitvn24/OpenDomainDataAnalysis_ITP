		<title>12BRITISH RAIL TEBAY</title>
		<content> My father is a engineer               
 He walks 4 miles 2 days a week along  
 part of the main line (Euston Glasgow)
 which runs through the village.There  
 are 11 men in his gang.He started when
 he was 19 because he thought that it  
 would be a steady job.In the winter   
 time if there is a lot of snow my dad 
 is called out for snow duty he has to 
 clean the points.In summer time if the
 weather is hot my dad checks his      
 stretch of line twice a day to make   
 sure the rails haven't gone soft in   
 the sun.He starts at 0730 to 1600 but 
 on Fridays he comes home at 1500.He   
 also has to work with his gang to keep
 embankments &amp; hedges tidy,repair walls
 and fences to prevent animals going on
 the track.
