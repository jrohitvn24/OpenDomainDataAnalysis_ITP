		<content>    Egglestone Abbey(ref:062,150) is   
 situated above the River Tees on the  
 south bank.It is a place well worth a 
 visit, in beautiful surroundings and  
 in easy walking distance of Barnard   
 Castle. Entrance is free.Egglestone   
{Abbey}was one of the thirty_three     
 Premonstratensian abbeys of St.       
 Norbert and the home of the White     
 Canons.It was built between 1195 and  
 1198 from local sandstone but was not 
 properly finished until about 1475.The
 north and west walls still stand.     
 Inside is the tomb of Sir Ralph Bowes 
 of Streatlam and eight graves.On one  
 is written:
