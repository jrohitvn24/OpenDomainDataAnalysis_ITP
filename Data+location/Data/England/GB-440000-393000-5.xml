		<content> An Interview                          
                                       
 My name is Mrs Johnson. My job is a   
 shopkeeper. I have worked in the shop 
 for nine years. There are two people  
 employed in the shop. We both would   
 like more facilities. The shop is a   
 General Store. The shop owner lives in
 the house overlooking the shop. It is 
 terraced house. There are about five  
 hundred houses round the shop. We have
 had some improvements in the area;    
 some houses have been knocked down and
 replaced with modern town houses.     
 I think there is not much future here.
 Maybe it will even be flattened.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
