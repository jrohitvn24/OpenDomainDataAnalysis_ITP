		<content> Picturesque Norfolk countryside. Much 
 more undulating than the rest of the  
 county. Even some quite steep hills.  
 Land cover is mainly winter cereals   
 but here are scatterd attractive      
 belts of trees mainly deciduous and a 
 few confiers. Because of the modern   
 methods of farming few people are     
 employed on the land.Neithr of the two
 villages (Letheringsett and Thornage) 
 has  post office. Both have closed in 
 the past 5 years. Thornage now has a  
 restaurant which is listed in the good
 food guide. To get to Hold which is an
 attractive town. There ae buses       
 including the successful community    
 mini bus but a car is most useful     
 particulary now that the facilities in
 the villages are very limited. Hold   
 has a populatin of three or four      
 thousand. It provides good shopping   
 there is a brand new large supermarket</content>
