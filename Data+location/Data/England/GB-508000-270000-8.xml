		<content>   Although the land is mainly used for
 arable farming, small areas of pasture
 are found near some farm buildings. At
 Little Catworth, this grassland still 
 shows clear traces of the old ridge   
 and furrow method of cultivation.     
                                       
   Sheep are rare, and the pasture is  
 generally grazed by cattle.   Notable 
 among these are the pedigree Murray   
 Greys and North Devons at Tilbrook    
 Grange, which regularly win prizes at 
 the East of England Show.             
                                       
   Nearby, at Blackwell Manor Farm,    
 fourteen electrically-ventilated      
 buildings house 22O,OOO broiler       
 chickens.  The chickens arrive at the 
 farm a few hours after hatching and   
 remain there for forty-nine days.  At 
 the end of that period they are sold  
 to fill the supermarket freezers.     </content>
