		<content>     My Dad works as a{part-time       
{contractor}on farms. In Winter, he    
{snow ploughs}for the County Council,  
 but he is only allowed to do this when
 the snow is at least 1.5 inches deep. 
 The tractor he uses is a John Deene   
 3040 with a 3 metre snow plough       
 attachment. At the moment, my Dad is  
{spraying;}he uses the same tractor and
 a Hardi TZ1000 21 metre sprayer. When 
 he is travelling down lanes, he knocks
 all the branches with the booms       
 because they are so high.             
      During the{Summer}holidays, he   
 will be combining for different       
 farmers, as well as ourselves. We have
 got a New Holland 8060 Combine, which 
 has a 4 metre bed, and a corn weigher 
 fitted on the spout. There is a       
 computer in the cab to calculate the  
 grain per hectare.
