		<title>11Irthlingborough's Old Bridge</title>
		<content>    The old bridge is on the A6, it    
has been there for 7 centuries, it is  
made of sandstone and ironstone and    
there are red brick supports over the  
arches. There are 13 arch ways under   
the bridge. It is 80 metres long and   
5 metres high. The bridge was          
originally built to carry pedestrians  
and horse drawn carts and was a single 
track with pedestrian refuges on both  
sides. As time went by, the bridge was 
widened to cope with increasing        
traffic. This first happened in  1754. 
They took the pedestrian refuges from  
the up-stream side and put supports    
under the water. By 1922,another       
attempt was made to do it again but    
the bridge could not take the weight   
and it started to show signs of        
crumbling. A new bridge would have to  
built.
