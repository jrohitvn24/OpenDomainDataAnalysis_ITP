		<title>12Education, Melchbourne</title>
		<content> There is no school in Melchbourne, so 
 the children have to be taken out of  
 the village for their education.      
 There is a choice for the 4/9 year    
 group. They can go to Eileen Wade     
 Lower School at Dean or Riseley Lower 
 School. The advantages of Riseley are 
 that it has a nursery unit for the    
 under fives and also that a special   
 school coach is provided. The         
 headmistress of Riseley Lower School  
 lives in Melchbourne.                 
 The 9/13 year olds go to Margaret     
 Beaufort Middle School at Riseley,    
 also by school coach.                 
 The older children, 13/18 year olds   
 are taken to Sharnbrook Upper School. 
 I n addition there are fee-paying     
 schools at Bedford, Dean and          
 Kimbolton.
