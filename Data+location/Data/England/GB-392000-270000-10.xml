		<content>{FRENCH SKIPPING}-You play French      
 skipping with a long piece of elastic.
 You double the elastic once, then you 
 tie a knot in it. Two people stand    
 inside the elastic and another person 
 jumps. There are three levels, ankles,
 knees and bummsies. On ankles you are 
 not allowed to stop at all and on     
 knees you have only one stop.But on   
 bummsies you can have as many stops as
 you like. You jump in and out in      
 different ways.                       
{STUCK IN THE MUD}-This is an exciting 
 game. There is one den and about two  
 people on. The idea of the game is to 
 dodge the people who are on and get   
 back to the den without being caught. 
 If you lose your 5 lives you are on.  
 When caught, you stand arms out-      
 stretched, until someone frees you by 
 going under your arms. You lose one   
 life every time you get caught.       </content>
