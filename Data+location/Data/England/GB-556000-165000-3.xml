manufacturing and distribution centre. 
Two new Leisure Centres have been

railway only transport is a small      
private bus running daily through the  
vaey via the Dartford Tunnel into      
Essex.The Parish has a small population
one notable is the Master of West Kent 
Hung - the hunt meets at the hostelry  
three times per year and on Boxing Day 
morn is a very fine sight to see.      </content>
