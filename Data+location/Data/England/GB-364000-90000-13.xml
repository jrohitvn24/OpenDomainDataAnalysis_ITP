		<content>}  Charminster has changed quite a lot 
 over the years.                       
   For instance houses and bungalows   
 have been converted, mainly for older 
 people.                               
   As you go into Charminster there are
 terraced houses which are compact and 
 ideal for a family to live in, these  
 were once army houses.                
   Also there is a school (St. Marys)  
 in Charminster which over the years   
 has become more populated, because    
 other schools have closed down, so    
 they come to Charminster. The         
 population of the school is now 104.  
   By the school is a pub called The   
 Three Compasses, and there is also The
 New Inn, which is also in Charminster.
   The population of Charminster is now
 2023.
