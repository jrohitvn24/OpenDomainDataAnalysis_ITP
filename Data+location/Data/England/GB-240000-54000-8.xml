		<title>08   The Torpoint Ferry cont.2</title>
		<content>  -service in the late evening when the
 chain ferry stopped running.          
    In the early 1920's the ferry      
 service was taken over by Cornwall    
 County Council. They ordered the      
 building of 2 new ferries which came  
 into service in 1925 and 1926. In 1932
 a third ferry was brought and another 
 set of chains were laid so that 2     
 ferries could operate simultaneously. 
 Towards the end of the 1930's         
 increasing amounts of traffic meant   
 the plans had to be made for another  
 set of chains to be laid so that a    
 third ferry could operate, these plans
 were abandoned owing to the war.      
    In 1960 the ferries that run today 
 came into operation and chains were   
 laid so that 3 ferries could run.     
  In 1985 these ferries are wearing out
 and will soon need replacing. A 4th   
 ferry is needed but will it come.     </content>
