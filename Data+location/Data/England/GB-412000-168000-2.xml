		<content> The conservation of the downs is      
 important because there are lots of   
 rare plants there.                    
 The downs mostly have gentle slopes.  
 In the winter some are good for       
 sledging on. You can walk on the downs
 as it is public land. A lot of        
 visitors go there to see "Devil's Den"
 which is where the devil was thought  
 to linger. Part of it was pulled down 
 for this very reason.                 
 There are many large stones called    
 grey wethers (wethers meaning sheep). 
 It is believed that they mark the     
 course of ancient streams. Stones at  
{Avebury}and{Stonehenge}probably came  
 from Overton and Fyfield Downs.
