		<title>14Hargate Hill.</title>
		<content> I went to the bottom of the school    
 playing field to view the countryside.
 These are some of the things I saw.   
 I saw a hill called{Hargate Hill,}and 
 in front of me up the hill by the main
 road was a ventilation shaft that     
 sends air into the mine.              
 I saw lots of fields. There were some 
 bright yellow fields growing oil-seed 
 rape, and there were lots of corn     
 fields. I saw some dark patches where 
 hedges had been removed so the fields 
 were bigger. There were some trees in 
 a straight line where the hedges had  
 been. I saw a wood called{Miles Wood} 
 and on the right there is a farm      
 called{Mount Pleasant Farm}and near   
 the bottom of the school field there  
 are some allotments.
