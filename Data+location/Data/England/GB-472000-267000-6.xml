		<title>06VILLAGE SCHOOL - PITSFORD</title>
		<content> EDUCATION IN THE VILLAGE TENDS TO     
 FOLLOW A NATIONAL PATTERN AND PITSFORD
 IS NO EXCEPTION. THERE IS A VILLAGE   
 SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES  
 OF FOUR AND TWELVE YEARS, CATERING FOR
 ONLY THIRTY CHILDREN AT PRESENT. OLDER
 CHILDREN GO TO THE NEIGHBOURING       
 VILLAGE OF MOULTON FOR THEIR SECONDARY
 EDUCATION, UNLIKE THE YEARS PRECEDING 
 THE 1944 EDUCATION ACT - PROVIDING    
 SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR ALL.          
 THE VILLAGE PRIMARY SCHOOL HAS ONLY   
 TWO FULL-TIME TEACHERS WHO TEACH THE  
 BASICS IN ALL SUBJECTS OF THE         
 CURRICULUM, ASSISTED BY PERIPATETIC   
 TEACHERS OF CERTAIN MUSICAL           
 INSTRUMENTS - THESE COME FROM A       
 CENTRAL POOL IN NORTHAMPTON. MANY OF  
 THE CHILDREN HAD BOTH PARENTS AND     
 GRANDPARENTS AS PAST SCHOLARS IN THE  
 VILLAGE SCHOOL AND WERE VERY PROUD OF 
 THIS FACT.                            </content>
