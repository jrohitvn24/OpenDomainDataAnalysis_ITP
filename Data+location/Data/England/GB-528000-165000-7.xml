		<content>     An old age pensioner living in the
area gave us her views on the changes  
as follows:                            
     There has been a big change in    
shopping. Prices have increased great- 
ly and huge shopping centres and stores
replace the small shops which used to  
sell only meat, bread, fish, etc. Many 
more people live here and to accommod- 
ate them highrise flats were built as  
well as houses.  Many are built of     
steel and concrete instead of bricks,  
and also the windows are much bigger.  
Plastic is often used instead of wood. 
     Fifty years ago public transport  
was tram or the rather dirty steam     
train.  Today we have the bus or much  
cleaner electric train which are also  
much faster. There are many more cars  
on the roads and fewer bicycles, and   
the road surfaces are much improved    
from the cobbled streets of the past.  </content>
