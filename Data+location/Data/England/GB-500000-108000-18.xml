		<title>18AN ISOLATED FARM, BURPHAM</title>
		<content> Peppering Farm lies in a fold of the  
 South Downs facing west. The long     
 slopes of the Downs are used for      
 extensive growing of cereals, while   
 cows graze the wetlands by the        
 meandering River Arun. From the farm  
 delightful views are obtained of the  
 wooded slopes of Arundel Park, the    
 fields of distant South Stoke Farm,   
 and the lane leading to the converted 
 lodge on the Park wall. Lanes lead off
 to the Downs which, while affording   
 access for the farmer and walker are  
 not much frequented by cars since     
 there is no way out over the Downs.   
 Large combines and other vehicles are 
 used on the farm and are housed in    
 picturesque buildings. Other lanes    
 lead down to the wet-lands their      
 verges full of wild flowers and the   
 hedges covered with honeysuckle and   
 blackberries.                         </content>
