		<title>01Mr. Honeybun's Farm.</title>
		<content>   Mr Honeybun is a{farmer}at Meare on 
 the Rice Farm.He is a dairy farmer and
 he owns 174 acres which he cuts twice 
 a year for silage.                    
   Mr Honeybun has 126 cows which is 30
 too many because of the EEC and the   
{government}cuts. To                   
 overcome this problem he feeds his    
 cows less food so they produce less   
 milk.His cows produce between 300 and 
 500 gallons a day.His milk goes to a  
 manufacturing{dairy}at Evercreech     
 which produces St.Ivel cream cheese.  
   Mr Honeybun has to get up by 6.30am 
 each morning for the first{milking.}He
 milks twice a day ,6.30am and 5.30pm. 
   The farm is a family affair,his two 
 sons help him,one is a permanent      
 worker and the other only helps part- 
 time.So for most of the time there are
 only two permanent workers.
