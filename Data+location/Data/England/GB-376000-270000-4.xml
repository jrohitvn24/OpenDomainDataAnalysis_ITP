		<content>   High Oak Farm covers 8o acres.There 
 are 5o calves,for beef,1oo breeding   
 Machiams and Suffolk rams.11ooo laying
 hens, 3ooo point of lay pullets,they  
 are called Warrow, a French bird.     
  Part of the farm is High Oak         
 Coppice,14 acres. The land mark is 3  
 Poplar trees,3oo years old. The land  
 is grade 2,it is heavy,stoney with 40 
 acres of grass.                       
  The owner's favourite play place was 
 Areley Wood. He went to school at     
 Heightington Hall,Bliss Gate, Far     
 Forest and Stourport Senior,now known 
 as Lickhill.                          
  The owner thinks it is possible that 
 it was a Manor Farm. In 1920-30 it was
 split up. The existing farm           
 buildings,made from ship timbers of   
 broken boats at Stourport             
 boat-yards,were replaced in 1975.
