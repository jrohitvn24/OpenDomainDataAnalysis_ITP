		<content> P.M.S. make plastic items. Per day    
 they make 115,000 pegs, 2,000 knives  
 and 20,000 spade handles. They have a 
 robot from Japan which does most of   
 the work. All the information is      
 stored on computer.                   
 There are 11 women and 21 men employed
 at the factory. The people in the     
 plastic department work shifts. They  
 pack their goods on the premises,     
 ready to be sold mainly abroad. They  
 import their raw materials from       
 Europe. They transport most of their  
 goods by road. The firm is ten years  
 old but has been in their present     
 premises for 7 years with Mr Painter  
 as manager.
