		<title>12THINGS TO DO</title>
		<content>      In Forest Town we have a lot of  
 sports fields to play all kinds of    
 sport. There are tennis courts,       
 football fields, cricket fields,      
 bowling greens and fishing areas. We  
 have three tennis courts. We do not   
 have a swimming pool in Forest Town   
 because it is only a small village.   
      In the village there is a youth  
 club which is open four days a week.  
 We also have a small library where    
 people can come and go.               
      St. Albans Church is the local   
 parish church and it is there that we 
 have winter discos in the evenings at 
 weekends. The church also runs clubs  
 like Cubs, Brownies, Scouts and       
 Guides.                               
      We are fortunate to have a park  
 where all the children can go and play
 on the swings and roundabouts that are
 there.           {MARK CAWAR          </content>
