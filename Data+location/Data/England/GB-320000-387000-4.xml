		<content>   This was a National Health Service  
 hospital until closed in 1983. As a   
 result of local concern, a trust was  
 formed to administer the hospital.    
 Appeals were launched to raise funds  
 and the hospital was registered as a  
 charity and re-opened in 1985.        
                                       
   The hospital offers residential care
 for 12 geriatric patients, 10 elderly 
 people with mental disorders and 8    
 ambulant handicapped people.          
 Physiotherapy and occupational therapy
 are available for residents. There is 
 an X-ray department, a chiropodist,   
 and a Day Centre for 25 handicapped or
 house-bound persons.                  
                                       
   The hospital is attended by local   
 doctors, has a large nursing staff and
 over 200 voluntary helpers.
