		<content> We have a very small class of 21      
 children. There are 4 boys and 14     
 girls. The Lower Juniors have games on
 a Thursday afternoon and the Upper    
 Juniors on  a Friday afternoon. We    
 play netball and football in the      
 winter and cricket rounders and tennis
 in the Summer. We are very lucky as we
 have a large tarmac playground and a  
 big field to play on.                 
  At lunch times some children bring   
 sandwiches to eat and others buy their
 lunch at the cash cafeteria which is  
 served by the kitchen staff and the   
 dinner ladies.
