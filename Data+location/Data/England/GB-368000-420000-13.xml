		<title>13Darwen Town Centre</title>
		<content> Darwen is trying to centralise all the
 social services available to the town.
 The streets used traditionally by the 
 town have changed their roles again.  
 The main buildings are large and help 
 to run the town. Down the road is a   
 health centre,a fire station,police   
 station and Social Services           
 Administration block. Round the corner
 is a youth club and a lower secondary 
 school. At the top of the rise is the 
 library and the theatre. Running down 
 School street we find some empty      
 buildings that are to be used as part 
 of a new shopping precinct. These will
 join to an indoor market which has a  
 car-park close by and an outdoor      
 annexe to the market. The U-shape     
 created by these streets has become a 
 busy,well-used area.
