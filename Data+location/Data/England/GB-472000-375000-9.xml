		<content>  Headon has one of the oldest houses  
 in Nottinghamshire. It is called {    
{AISLED},in modern english it          
 translates as{OLD HOUSE}.There is also
 a moat behind Headon Manor. Three     
 cannon balls have been found in and   
 around Headon, probably from the Civil
 War in 1642. An ancient, large burial 
 mound is in Gamston Wood. Saxon       
 findings and a homestead have been    
 unearthed at the corner of the wood.  
  The name{Headon}comes from{Hai don}  
 which means high hill.{NETHER}=lower, 
 therefore Nether Headon =lower hill.  
 Upton was Uptown, a farm settlement   
 and is a more recent name than Headon.
  Askham originates from Ash, an old   
 ash tree giving the settlement its    
 origin.                               
  Headon Church was built in 1250.
