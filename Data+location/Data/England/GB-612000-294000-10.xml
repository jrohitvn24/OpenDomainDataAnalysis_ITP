		<title>10POULTRY FARMING,TACOLNESTON</title>
		<content>{Poultry farming at "The Spinneys"  }  
 began in 1961 with units housing      
 10,000 laying birds &amp; survived until  
 the end of the decade when houses were
 converted for pullet rearing.With the 
 reluctance of egg producers to sign   
 contracts with rearers this operation 
 became untenable.The unit now produces
 16,000 table birds every 10 weeks,    
 usually obtaining weight in excess    
 of 6lbs.Throughout, beagle puppies    
 have been reared as a sideline.       
                                       
{Woodside Turkey Farm}owned by a       
 company in Diss has 11 acres with 2   
 poultry houses containing 1200 birds, 
 these are breeding stock 10% of which 
 are males.The hatching eggs are taken 
 to Lincoln for incubation.
