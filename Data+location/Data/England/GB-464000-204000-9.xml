		<content>Tiddington is the largest village in   
the sector.Like Shabbington,it has an  
old church still in use,where two      
family names are prominent in the      
graveyard-Maule,and Ilbery.The Ilberys 
live at North Weston,and Tiddington.   
There is a caravan sales centre, a     
garage, and a pub,on the A418,and a    
small post office off the main road.   
The road is heavily used and has no    
crossing-there is a dangerous bend as  
you enter the village from Thame.The   
homes on the A418 are mostly old,of    
stone or brick with chimneys.Some are  
thatched-one thatchers mark was a bird.
On the Ickford road are newer homes and
bungalows.We think that the heavy      
traffic must make life restricting for 
old or handicapped people and children,
and you need a car to live there since 
there are so few buses and shops.There 
are no schools-pupils must travel.     </content>
