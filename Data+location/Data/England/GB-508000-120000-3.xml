		<content>  In the centre the hamlet of Broadford
 Bridge lies around the junction of two
 lanes. One winds from West Chiltington
 across to Coneyhurst; the other is the
 secondary road B.2133, which was known
 as 'the King's Highway' from the first
 mention of roads in the l7th C.  This 
 bears all the signs of a medieval road
 with several old farms set well back. 
 In the southeast corner the B.2139    
 from Storrington runs straight almost 
 due north to Coolham, where it crosses
 the A.272, a former turnpike road. The
 B.2139, a busy commuter traffic route 
 to Horsham,  Crawley,  and  Hayward's 
 Heath, has one infrequent bus service.
  There are many footpaths in the area,
 some difficult to negotiate even in   
 fine weather.  Bridlepaths are being  
 increasingly used by horse-riders,    
 young and old, as more families keep  
 horses and riding stables proliferate.</content>
