		<content>     Mr. Wilson, the farmer told us a  
 lot about his farm. He told us about  
 some of the crops he grew. The one we 
 were interested in was linseed,       
 because it could be made into medicine
 for cows. It also has a lovely blue   
 flower. The farm got it's name from   
 some exiles who came from america to  
 England and they decided to call it   
 New England Farm. The farmer used to  
 breed chickens, but when business was 
 not good, he stopped. As far as we    
 could see, there were fields of wheat 
 and barley.
