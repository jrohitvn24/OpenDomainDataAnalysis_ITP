		<title>12TRAINS AND CANALS IN ROMSEY</title>
		<content> We looked at the trains along the     
 tracks.  We decided they went into    
 five sets and counted up which ones   
 came most often.  The signal box is   
 modern and electronic but the old     
 signal box is in our school grounds   
 with all the levers.  It will be      
 restored by the Romsey and District   
 Preservation Trust.  The canal was    
 built to go between Andover and       
 Redbridge shortly before the railway  
 so it was not used much.  Coal and    
 heavy things were moved on it.  There 
 was a wharf at the Harrage.  Not much 
 remains; just the Timsbury - Harrage  
 section and part at Nursling.
