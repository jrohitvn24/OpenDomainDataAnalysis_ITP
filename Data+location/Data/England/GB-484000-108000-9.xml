		<title>09The Village Fete in Lavant 2</title>
		<content> One of the stalls at Lavant Fete sold 
 home made crafts.These were pottery   
 houses with a little light in them and
 some little pottery cottages.There    
 were also candles with your star sign 
 on,and wooden key racks.The people on 
 the stalls were very pleased with     
 their home made crafts.The prices of  
 these may have been expensive but they
 were worth it.There was also a        
 pancake stall. You could smell the    
 onions frying and all the other       
 fillings_lemon and sugar,golden       
 syrup,jam and savoury fillings.The    
 pancakes must have been very tasty    
 because there was an enormous crowd   
 queuing up waiting  to be served.The  
 price of the pancakes was 25p each    
 which was very reasonable.
