		<title>11 Types of houses we live in.</title>
		<content>                                       
 In Tamworth there are {three main     
types} of houses that people live in,  
terraced, semi-detached and detached.  
A terraced house is joined on both     
sides to the houses next to it though  
it may have a passageway through to the
rear. A semi-detached house is joined  
on just one side and a detached house, 
as the name suggests, is not attached  
to the houses next door to it.         
 A {typical semi-detached house} will  
probably have three bedrooms and a     
bathroom upstairs. Downstairs there    
will be a large kitchen, a living room 
and a lounge. The house may well have a
garage and a large garden to the rear. 
Some semi-detached houses may have a   
greenhouse or a garden shed.
