		<content> Danbury offers  a tremendous range of 
 building types to the observer.These  
 settlements date from the 16th century
 to the very modern buildings of the   
 1980's.Looking into the future at the 
 projected extension of Stanstead      
 Airport,the housing in Danbury will   
 probably be extended,to deal with more
 employment in the area.Clearly visible
 are historical buildings which have   
 interesting  pasts.Such as Frettons   
 which  was origanaly a girls boarding 
 school,and then on to Danbury Palace.A
 vast range of building materials have 
 contributed to the architecture of the
 village.These range from Norman arches
 to wattle and daub to oak beams to the
 modern red brick.                     
 A survey was undertaken from people   
 which go to Danbury Park School and   
 live in Danbury.This demonstrated that
 most people live in a detached house. </content>
