		<title>06Arable Farming at New House</title>
		<content> Mr Boffey lives at New House Farm with
 his wife and two schoolboy sons.He    
 farms with one agricultural worker who
 has been there for 25 years. The farm 
 is 300 acres, of which 285 are        
{arable.}There is a pretty pond and a  
 small wood carefully maintained. When 
 Mr Boffey was young his father ran    
 the propety as a{mixed farm,}but Mr   
 Boffey decided to give up milk        
 production and keep{beef cattle}only. 
 Later on he finished keeping animal   
 altogether. This meant alterations to 
 the buildings and to the field system 
 (and resulted in much more{recreation)
 Many hedges have been pulled up to    
 enlarge the fields,land drains have   
 laid, and incovenient bumps and dips  
 have been levelled so machines can    
 operate efficiently.
