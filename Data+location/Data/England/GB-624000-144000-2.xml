		<title>02A walk on the downs - Lydden</title>
		<content>In the late afternoon of July 3rd 1985 
we walked a footpath along the North   
Downs just south of the main road      
between Dover and Canterbury.The       
previous winter had been bitterly cold,
well below freezing,followed by an     
unusually wet June.This had delayed the
growth of many plants,but the grass had
flourished.                            
The afternoon was warm and sunny and   
the footpath we followed crossed open  
downland.The ground below us was       
uneven.Most of it was planted with     
barley which was knee high.To the left 
was a hedgerow planted with oak,ash,   
elder and hawthorn.                    
The wild roses,elder and blackberry    
were flowering.The downlands are a good
hunting ground for wild flowers.On our 
brief walk we saw bladdercampion,      
forget-me-not,vetches,mayweed and      
poppies.                               </content>
