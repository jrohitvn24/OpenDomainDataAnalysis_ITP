		<title>06THE RIVER WYE AT HOARWITHY</title>
		<content> The beautiful river Wye rises in the  
 Plynlimon Mountains in Mid Wales,and  
 flows for 155 miles through scenic    
 countryside to its junction with the  
 river Severn at Chestow.The riverside 
 village of Hoarwithy is almost mid-way
 alongthe length of the Wye on one of  
 its characteristic meanders,which is  
 crossed here by a narrow iron road    
 bridge.The river is managed by the    
 Welsh Water Authority,and is the      
 onlyriver in England which has its    
 entire length designated a SSSI(Site  
 of Special Scientific Interest).The   
 Wye is free of pollution where many   
 varied species of plant and animal    
 life can survive.At Hoarwithy the Wye 
 provides an ideal recretional area for
 fishing,canoeing,walking,raft racing  
 and camping.The quiet scenic river    
 banks are also popular with bird      
 watchers,painters and photographers.  </content>
