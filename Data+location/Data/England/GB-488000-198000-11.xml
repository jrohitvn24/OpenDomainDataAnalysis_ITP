		<title>11       Sedges Farm</title>
		<content>   There are all sorts of farms in this
 area;some dairy farms,a few sheep     
 farms and some arable. Mr.Kyle owns   
 Sedges Farm which is over five hundred
 years old. It has 180 acres and he    
 also has 60 acres of woodland and he  
 rents 12 acres. He is a sheep farmer  
 so his fields are all grassland to    
 provide food for the sheep. Mr.Kyle   
 does not employ anybody full-time,but 
 has some part time employees. He is   
 helped by his wife and three children.
   He keeps four hens and two ducks,but
 he does not sell the eggs.The farm has
 380 ewes which produce about 680 lambs
 per year. The lambs are sold for meat 
 and the ewes are kept for wool which  
 is worth Â£1,400.                      
   Each year Mr.Kyle spends Â£8,500 on  
 food for the animals and Â£5,000 on    
 silage.
