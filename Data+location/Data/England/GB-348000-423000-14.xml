		<title>14NEW LONGTON A separate place</title>
		<content>   NEW LONGTON is a completely         
 different village from Longton. A     
 newer community was built round the   
 railway station in the last 100 years.
 There are three general shops         
 converted from houses, and a block of 
 modern shops. The Church was built in 
 1960 and consecrated in 1964. There is
 a new village hall in the process of  
 being built.                          
{  The New Longton Cricket Club}plays  
 in the Chorley and District League and
 is well supported, running two teams  
 each season. They also run a football 
 team for the boys of the village.     
{  The Bowling Club}is also a popular  
 meeting place for New Longtoners since
 there is a bar inside the club house  
 for refreshment to be taken in case of
 inclement weather. The Club is        
 exclusive except on  Fridays  when    
 ladies are allowed.                   </content>
