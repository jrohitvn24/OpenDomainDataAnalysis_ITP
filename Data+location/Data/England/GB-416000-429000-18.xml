		<title>18Transport in South Bradford.</title>
		<content> The area is well served by several{bus
{routes}with a proposed new route to be
 hopefully established soon.No{bus}    
{station}is sited in the vicinity,the  
 nearest being in the{centre of}       
{Bradford.}Convenient bus services link
 the area to the Bradford{Interchange} 
 where buses,coaches and trains depart 
 to all parts of the country.A further 
 railway station takes passengers N and
 W.From the Interchange there are bus  
 links to the{Leeds/Bradford airport,} 
 recently enlarged to take jumbo jets. 
 Motor vehicles have a ready access to 
 all parts of the block,though many    
 streets are cul-de-sacs due to        
 modernisation about 8 years ago.3 main
 roads pass through the area and the   
{M606}links Bradford with the{motorway}
{system.}However Bradford has always   
 been on the fringe of major road and  
 rail networks.                        </content>
