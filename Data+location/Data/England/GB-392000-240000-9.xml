		<title>09A Day At Eckington School.</title>
		<content> I usually leave home at 8.50 and go in
 the car to school. I reach school at  
 8.52. When I have put my coat and bag 
 away , and mum has put my sandwich box
 away, I wait in te corridor with my   
 mum until 9.00. When 9.00 comes the   
 bell rings and I say goodbye to mum   
 and go into assembly. We sing a hymn, 
 say our prayers then go into class and
 do Maths Adventure. At 10.40 the bell 
 goes and we go to play. At 10.55 the  
 bell goes again and we come in and    
 write stories for the Domesday        
 Project. The bell goes for dinner time
 at 12.00.We all go into the assembly  
 hall to have dinner. I usually have   
 tomato sandwiches, a chocolate        
 biscuit, an apple and a drink. then I 
 go and play tag. At 1.20 I change for 
 PE,in PE we play pinball. At 2.00 we  
 go back to class and read. At 2.25 the
 bell goes again and we change back.   </content>
