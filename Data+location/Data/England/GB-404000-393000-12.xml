  They produce{700 litres}of milk per  
 day.{Two hundred litres}are kept to be
 sold on the milk round and the rest is
 sent to the dairy.                    
     The milk is stored in large       
 stainless steel storage tanks in the  
 milking parlour. It is taken away by  
 tanker for bottling.                  
     The farmer owns{two}milk floats   
 which deliver milk to the surrounding 
 area including the whole of{Glossop,  
{Simmondley}and part of{Hadfield.}They
