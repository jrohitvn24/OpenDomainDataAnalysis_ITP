		<content> The area of Trowbridge we at John of  
 Gaunt surveyed lies to the west of    
 the town and is bordered by Frome     
 Road, Newtown, the railway line on one
 side and the urban distric boundary on
 the other. This area was broken into  
 six sections and each was surveyed by 
 a team of pupils. This report is a    
 summary of all their surveys. This    
 area is one of great contrasts in     
 nearly every respect. It is mainly    
 built up and residential but there is 
 a variety of commercial, educational  
 and religious establishments. There is
 also quite a lot of open land that is 
 used for a variety of purposes. The   
 housing in the area is extremely      
 varied. It is substantially private   
 housing although the Studley Green    
 Estate is a council scheme.
