		<content>    Miss Bede worked for 60 years and 4
 days in The White Lion public house   
 in{Bradninch.}Her recent book is      
 entitled '60 Years behind Bars'. She  
 attended the school in West End Road  
 and left in 1918.                     
    She did not go to work for a while 
 as she looked after her three brothers
 and sisters. The White Lion used to be
 a{coach house.}During the Second World
{War,}she became a postwoman and her   
 round was considerably large.She had  
 two girl evacuees to stay, one of whom
 became a Headteacher. When Miss Bede  
 left school, she received a medal     
 saying she had attended school for one
 year.                                 
    At{Christmas}time, a stick of holly
 served as a tree. A candle was tied on
 with string.She enjoyed meeting us at 
 school and is a cheerful, lively and  
 friendly Bradninch character.         </content>
