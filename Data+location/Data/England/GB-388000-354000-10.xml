		<content>  From the age of five children attend 
a  primary school in the area,where    
they are taught to read and write.When 
they are nine they move to Park Middle 
School where the courses available are 
more varied and detailed to include the
arts and sciences.                     
  At the age of thirteen the children  
progress to the High School.In their   
first year pupils are given a general  
education to enable them at the end of 
the year to choose their examination   
subjects (either C.S.E,"O" level,or    
16+).At the age of   sixteen pupils    
can leave school having  taken         
examinations or not.Alternatively they 
can stay on in the Sixth Form to       
further their education.Courses here   
include; exam re-takes,extra "O"levels,
"A"levels,and the recently introduced  
C.P.V.E.which involves work experience 
combined with academic study.          </content>
