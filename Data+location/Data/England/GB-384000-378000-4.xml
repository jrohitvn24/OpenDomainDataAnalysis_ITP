		<content> Wilmslow and Alderley Edge lie on the 
{A34,}a major road which links the     
 south of England with Manchester.     
 Despite the building of the M.6.,in   
 recent years this road has become     
 heavily{congested}with traffic,       
 particularly during the peak periods  
 when people travel to and from work.In
 a recent weekday{traffic count}a total
 of 2,312 vehicles passed through      
 Alderley Edge between the hour        
 7.55a.m._8.55a.m. The road is         
 particularly narrow and there are     
 several pedestrian crossings. Road    
 users show a{high degree of tolerance 
 _there was only one sounding of a     
 motor horn during the period of the   
 above traffic count.
