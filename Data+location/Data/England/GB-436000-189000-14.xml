		<content> Denchworth C.of E. Church  can seat   
 about 100 people and about 16 people  
 attend. There are only occasional     
 services and functions. The parish is 
 tended by a minister from Steventon,  
 who also visits the elderly and sick. 
 Children attend Sunday School once a  
 month. There is no choir. Weddings,   
 christenings and funerals are rare. In
 Grove the C.of E. is very active. It  
 is regularly packed to capacity (150  
 people) and there are 4 - 5 services a
 week besides being prayer and Bible   
 study meetings. The congregation is   
 young, so that thereare activities    
 for families, teenagers and children  
 but there is not yet need to cater for
 the elderly. Help for the Third World 
 and charities plays a large part in   
 the Church life. A Harvest Supper and 
 Carol Service are popular. Methodists 
 have a Grove Chapel, others fo to W/T.</content>
