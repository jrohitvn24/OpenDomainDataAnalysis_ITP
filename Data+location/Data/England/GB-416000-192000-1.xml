		<content> In our area we have part of Highworth 
 and all of Hannington.Our part of     
 Highworth is mainly new houses.There  
 are two sewage works,one in           
 Hannington and one just outside       
 Highworth. The land is mainly         
 farmland.There are twelve farms,      
 mostly near Hannington,and many are   
 intensively managed grassland. Through
 the area flows Bydemill Brook.It      
 enters our area near Hampton Farm and 
 runs to the North then on to the      
 Thames.We have a disused railway      
 track.The railway used to run from    
 Highworth to Swindon.Such goods as    
 milk were transported on it,and also  
 men who were employed at the Swindon  
 Railway Works.
