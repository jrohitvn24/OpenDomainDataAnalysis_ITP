		<content> Pilgrims Hatch is the largest private 
 housing area. Many of the houses are  
 fairly modern semi-detached bungalows,
 although most roads contain brick     
 and pebble-dashed inter-war houses    
 with tiled roofs and casement windows.
 The cost of a three-bedroomed         
 semi-detached house is Â£40-50,000.All 
 have garages. Also,in Hatch Road there
 are some older terraces of former     
 farmworkers' cottages which have been 
 modernized.The gardens are well kept, 
 but the general appearance of the     
 roads is spoilt by the large number of
 telephone wires and telegraph poles.  
 Most occupants have white-collar jobs,
 managerial,lecturing,teaching and     
 accounting. Almost every family has at
 least one car,a T.V.,a fridge and a   
 video.All have bathrooms and inside   
 toilets.
