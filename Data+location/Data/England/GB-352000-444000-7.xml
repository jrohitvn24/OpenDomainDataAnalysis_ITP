		<title>07VILLAGE HALL, CALDER VALE</title>
		<content> The {Village Hall }is owned and run by
 the people of the village.  It has    
 recently had numerous improvements    
 carried out together with a general   
 facelift.  A great deal of money has  
 had to be raised for this mainly by   
 the villagers and local people        
 themselves.  Many functions and events
 have been held by individuals or      
 organisations to raise money.         
                                       
 The Hall is used for regular meetings 
 of the Womens'Institute, a playgroup, 
 as well as a doctor's surgery on      
 several days each week, one of the    
 Garstang doctors making the journey to
 the village.  This is much            
 appreciated, especially by the older  
 folk who find difficulty travelling.  
 The churches also use the hall for    
 various social and fund raising       
 activities.                           </content>
