		<title>17HOLIDAY CAMP FIRE AT WOOTTON</title>
		<content>  In April, 1985{a fire}devastated the 
 heart of the  disused{Warner's        
{Woodside Holiday Camp}in Wootton on   
 the Isle of Wight.It caused an        
 estimated million pounds worth of     
 damage.It took the local Fire Brigade 
 eleven hours to put the blaze         
 out.They used water from the camp     
 swimming pool to help put out the     
 blaze.All that remained after the fire
 was the frame of the two storey       
 entertainment complex and  nearly all 
 of the camp equipment was destroyed.  
  The camp itself had been closed for  
 the past two seasons, being used as a 
 convenient storing place for materials
 from four other Warner's holiday camps
 on the island.                        
  It is thought that the fire was      
 started by two very young boys playing
 with matches in the camp.
