		<title>14OUR EDUCATION &amp; SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Our school has been involved in this
 project for a long time and it has    
 taken a lot of our class lesson time. 
 Next term most of us are going to     
 Secondary school. It is a strange year
 this year because not only our year is
 going up, but the 3rd. year are going 
 up too. This is because of something  
 called 'reorganisation'. It all sounds
 quite daft to me &amp; I don't see why    
 they couldn't leave things alone.     
  We are called a Middle school now but
 next year it will be a Junior school. 
 I think I am glad that I am leaving   
 now as I prefer to be in a Middle     
 school as it sounds more grown up.    
   There a lot of teachers leaving this
 year...even Mr.Masfield who organised 
 all this.                             
   There are 310 children in our shool 
 now.In the secondary school there will
 be 601 which is a lot more.           </content>
