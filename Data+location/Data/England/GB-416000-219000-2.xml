		<title>02A walk through Bourton</title>
		<content> Many thousands of visitors come to    
{Bourton-on-the-Water}from all parts of
 the world to enjoy the delightful     
 charm of this{Cotswold}stone village  
 with its wide green, broad, shallow   
 stream and graceful small bridges. The
 largely 18th century{Church of St.    
{Lawrence}stands on the site of a{Roman
{temple}and the{Fosseway}passes just to
 the west of the village. In addition  
 to the attractive stone houses there  
 are numerous hotels, inns, restaurants
 and cafes.                            
 The clear{River Windrush}has been     
 directed through the centre of the    
 village and passes beneath the        
 parapets of low, arched stone bridges 
 which form one of the main attractions
 of the village. It is shaded by trees 
 and the wide green provides visitors  
 with an opportunity for a restful     
 break in their sightseeing.           </content>
