		<title>09SOUTH LANDING, FLAMBOROUGH</title>
		<content> South Landing is a cut in the cliffs. 
 At one time it was an important port  
 in the area. Today there is a disused 
 lifeboat station at the side of the   
 beach. A few cobles are launched from 
 there. The steep slopes at the side of
 teh cut are wooded. Recently the      
 nature trail has been made in to an   
 invalid walk. The path has been       
 widened and made more level so that   
 people in wheelchairs can go round the
 walk. At the top of the cut there is  
 an information centre, it sells       
 leaflets and tells you about the life 
 in the sea. There are a lot of walks  
 starting at South Landing, one goes to
 Beacon Hill and another one goes to   
 the lighthouse. The beach is quite    
 sandy but there is a lot of seaweed.  
 You can find lots of creatures on the 
 beach; limpets, crabs, cockles,       
 muscles, winkles, shrimp and seals.   </content>
