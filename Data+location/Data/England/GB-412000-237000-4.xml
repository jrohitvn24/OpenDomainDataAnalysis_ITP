		<content> Chipping Campden and the area about is
 a very peaceful place and its people  
 are law-abiding. There is a Police    
 Station in Campden in the High Street.
 It is manned by one sergeant and four 
 constables but only up to midnight.   
 After that time a cry for help would  
 be passed to a larger station in the  
 district. In an average week the      
 police would be called out about      
 twenty times for road accidents,petty 
 crimes,traffic control and fires. They
 have to keep check on gun licences. On
 special occasions the police are      
 helped by volunteers called Special   
 Constables. These would keep order at 
 election time or to control the crowds
 at Scuttlebrook Wake. The only weapons
 carried by the police are truncheons. 
 In the courtroon attached to the      
 station the Magistrates hear cases    
 every second Wednesday.               </content>
