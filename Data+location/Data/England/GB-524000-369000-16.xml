		<title>16NEW ESTATES AND OLD HOUSES</title>
		<content>           { NEW ESTATES               
    We interviewed several people      
 living on new estates.  They gave us  
 various reasons as to why they live   
 there.  These were: nice bungalows,   
 cheaper rates, access to countryside, 
 the fact that it is easy to meet and  
 get to know people.                   
    Because the estates are all on the 
 outskirts of the town, the main       
 disadvantage is that people need a car
 as there are no local buses.          
                                       
           { OLD  HOUSES               
    The people we interviewed gave us  
 these reasons as to why they live in  
 older houses: they are cheaper to buy,
 have more room, and are more pleasant 
 to live in.  Since the houses are old,
 some have the disadvantages of leaking
 roofs, bad insulation and rotting     
 woodwork.                             </content>
