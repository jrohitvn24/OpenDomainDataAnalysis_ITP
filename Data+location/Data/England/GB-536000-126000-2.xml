		<title>02Old Church Cottages</title>
		<content>    Some very old cottages are situated
 between the church and the school. Old
 Church Cottages used to be a priest's 
 house and in one of the walls there   
 used to be some holy water. Where the 
 bathroom is it used to be a wood shed.
 They had to make it into a bathroom   
 because the houses used to be one big 
 house and you can see where a door has
 been filled in. One half is bigger    
 than the other.                       
                                       
   It is nearly 400 years old and is   
 one of the oldest buildings in the    
 village. When it was built it was one 
 of the better houses. The walls are   
 hollow and birds nest in them and all 
 you can hear is the chicks crying for 
 some more food. Living in an old house
 like this can be cold and cramped. I  
 know because I live there.
