		<content> A sample survey carried out in the    
 village revealed that 66% of the      
 interviewees had moved into the       
 village in the past 10 years and this 
 has led to an inevitable gap in       
 outlook between the"old" and "new"    
 village.Some of the older residents   
 expressed concern that their village  
 had lost some of its identity and     
 regretted the disappearance of the    
 countryside of their youth.Both"old"  
 and"new"villagers are,however,united  
 in their concern over the recently    
 published"Village Development Plan"   
 which envisages the building of       
 another 230 houses in the village.    
 The younger people of the village hope
 that the developemnts will bring new  
 amenities whilst the local traders    
 welcome the potential additional      
 custom.
