		<title>03A LUNCHEON CLUB</title>
		<content> A Luncheon Club is run in the village 
 hall on four days a week. The club    
 starts at 12 o'clock and fifteen      
 people come usually.  The Catering    
 Supervisor said to us that he puts the
 food in the freezer and he opened some
 of the dinner and we saw some quite   
 nice things. It was potato and things 
 like that. They had a turbo wave oven 
 that cooked food quickly. He showed us
 a big box where they could put food to
 take around the village to people who 
 cannot get out. A lady collects this  
 in a van.
