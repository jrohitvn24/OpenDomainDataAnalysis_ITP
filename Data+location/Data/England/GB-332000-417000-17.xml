		<title>17Centre for the elderly</title>
		<content>    The centre is a day centre for     
 Southport citizens of retirement age. 
 It opened in 1973 as a club. Some of  
 the people have been attending since  
 it started.                           
    Television is popular and favourite
 programmes are "Connections",         
 "Wimbledon", and "The Price is        
 Right". Knitting and crocheting are   
 also popular and one lady even used to
 go to "Keep Fit".                     
    Sometimes there are arguments over 
 such topics as politics, television,  
 cheating at card games and saving     
 seats for friends, but generally they 
 all get on well like one big happy    
 family.
