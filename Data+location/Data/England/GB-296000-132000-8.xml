		<content> A month after the restoration the     
 building was almost destroyed by fire 
 but a passing labourer noticed some   
 smoke coming from a window and the    
 flames from a stove that had been left
 to dry out the church were put out.   
                                       
 The last incumbent was in 1872 when   
 the parish was united with Treborough.
 In this century it was united         
 first with Brompton Regis and in 1971 
 with Upton Skilgate as well. In 1958  
 the building was said to be dangerous 
 and{a closed notice was put up but    
{after an appeal and a big effort to   
{raise the money the church was        
{reopened after a fine piece of        
{restoration in 1961.                  
{The registers began in 1697.          
{ }
