		<content> There is one school in Thorner..this  
 is Saint Peter's Church of England    
 Primary School.                       
                                       
 The school was originally in an old   
 building close to St. Peter's Church  
 at the end of Main Street.            
                                       
 The children wear a blue school       
 uniform.                              
                                       
 The children of the school felt that  
 games and mathematics were the most   
 popular subjects, history, topic work 
 and science were less popular.        
                                       
 Rounders was the most popular summer  
 game played by the girls, and cricket 
 the most popular summer game for boys.
