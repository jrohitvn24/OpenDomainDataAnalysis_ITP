		<content> BOY-My favourite meal is sausages,    
 chips and peas. After I like Arctic   
 Roll or Trifle. I enjoy playing       
 "Sorry" and "Test Match". I was given 
 some "Look-In" comics, I think they're
 the best. My favourite sport is       
 swimming. I take my Gold Survival this
 year. I enjoy football and rounders.  
 The best television programmes are    
 "Young Ones", "BMX Track Wars", "The A
 Team" and "Street Hawk".              
 GIRL-My favourite dog is called Jack. 
 Our car is silver, my favourite       
 colour. My most favoured foods are    
 tomato, ham, boiled eggs, tomato soup,
 lemonade and Coke. I enjoy scribbling 
 on bits of paper and reading books. I 
 am reading an exciting story called   
 "Supermouse". I play Gran's piano and 
 have an electric organ of my own.
