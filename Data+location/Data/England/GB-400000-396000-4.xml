		<title>04EATING PATTERNS SURVEY</title>
		<content> A survey was made into eating patterns
 in the two age groups 7-11 (Primary)  
 and 11-13 (Secondary). The following  
 results were recorded.                
 During the school week 50% of the     
 children never have a cooked          
 breakfast. On Saturday 39% of the     
 7-11s and 53% of the 11-13s have a    
 cooked beakfast. On Sunday 40% of both
 groups have a cooked breakfast.       
 During the school week the most       
 popular time to have the main meal is 
 in the evening. The most popular time 
 for dinner on Sunday is between 4-6pm 
 while 30% eat between 12 and 2pm.     
 Eating out in a cafe or restaurant was
 more popular with the 7-11s while 43% 
 of the 11-13s only eat out on special 
 occasions. Take-away meals were       
 popular with both groups but the      
 11-13s eat them more often.
