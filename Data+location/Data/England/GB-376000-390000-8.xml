		<content> Much of the leisure time of 12-14 year
 olds at Sale Girls' Grammar School is 
 occupied by watching television,      
 listening to music, dancing, reading  
 and attending Guides and youth clubs. 
 The most popular hobby is collecting; 
 items range from coins to dolls. Many 
 keep pets, sew, cook and do jig-saws. 
 Computer games, cards and board games 
 like monopoly are the favourite indoor
 games. Swimming and tennis are the    
 most popular sports but badminton, ice
 skating and horse riding also have    
 numerous participants. Sale Water Park
 provides facilities for various water 
 sports and has guided nature walks. Of
 the many sports clubs and parks in    
 Sale, the Leisure Centre with its     
 three pools and sports hall is the    
 most used. Sale Harriers Club         
 encourages young people in all        
 branches of athletics.                </content>
