		<title>12  RECREATION ( Adults )</title>
		<content>We conducted a survey to find out the  
ways in which adults in Dartford like  
to spend their spare time.  Most men   
and women spent their time gardening,  
listening to music,watching television 
and shopping.  If they had more spare  
time they would choose to travel, play 
more sport and do more gardening.      
If they had more money they would most 
likely use it to travel or move house.
