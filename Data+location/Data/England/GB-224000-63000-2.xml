		<title>02Unemployment ,Liskeard Area</title>
		<content> Unemployment and its related social   
 and financial problems remains a      
 cause for much local concern;a concern
 often reflected in the area's media.  
 The number of people registered as    
 unemployed for the first 6 months of  
 1985 were:-Jan.754:Feb.736:Mar.719:   
 Apr.691:May 692:June 663.             
 In May 1985,the Job Centre placed 61  
 in work to leave 692 (444 men) on its 
 register; 31 more than May 1984. 8 of 
 the 692 were aged under 18. In June   
 1985,the Centre registered 663 people 
 (425 men);117 more than June 1984.    
 Seasonal work tied to the holiday     
 trade usually lessens the number of   
 unemployed during the summer months   
 but it is generally felt that the long
 -term prospects for creating full and 
 lasting  employment either locally or 
 within commuting distance will remain 
 poor for many years to come.          </content>
