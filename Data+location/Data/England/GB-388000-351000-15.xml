		<title>15The Nature Reserve at Norton</title>
		<content>Near Ford Green Hall there is a nature 
reserve. It is a quiet place where     
people come to look at the birds and   
plants. Before it was waste land but   
now trees and grass have been planted  
to make it look nice. There is a foot- 
path which leads around the lake.In    
the lake are many water weeds as well  
as tiny fish which you are not allowed 
to catch. There are swans,ducks, coots 
and moorhens. The swan's nest is made  
of reeds and stands about a metre above
the reed bed. This year one of the     
swans, named Charlie, was killed.Now   
there is only one swan and unless      
another swan is put in there will be   
no eggs next year.                     
 Nature reserves are places where you  
can have pleasure without paying any   
thing.This one has the added attraction
of being next door to Ford Green Hall  
museum.                                </content>
