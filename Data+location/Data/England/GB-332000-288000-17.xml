		<title>17BISHOPS CASTLE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> One day we interviewed a policeman.His
 name was P.C.Lewis.He is part of the  
 West Mercia Constabulary.He has only  
 been in Bishops Castle since January. 
                                       
 When they arrest people for stealing  
 cars you are arrested on suspicion of 
 stealing a motor vehicle.After they   
 arrest them they take them to Ludlow  
 police station.Anything they say is   
 taken down as evidence.               
                                       
 This year they have arrested 4 people 
 for assault,2 people for criminal     
 damage and two for stealing.They have 
 had four burglarys but no robberies.  
   The two policeman went on picket    
 duty during the miners strike.        
                                       
 They do go to football matches usually
 in Shrewsbury.                        
                                       </content>
