		<title>10LANDSCAPE OF LAYER BRETON</title>
		<content> Layer Breton Heath consists of 33     
 acres of common land. Originally this 
 area was grassland, but over the years
 a great change has taken place, with  
 the growth of heathers, gorse and     
 deciduous trees. Over the years people
 have built their homes around the     
 heath , using the land for grazing and
 recreation.In the earlier part of this
 century it was used as the village    
 cricket ground, which gives some indi-
 cation of how clear the area was at   
 the time. Today it remains common land
 still used for grazing geese and      
 horses. People still find the heath   
 ideal for walking, exercising animals 
 and as a picnic area.                 
 The heath's well-being is primarily   
 the concern of the Parish Council,    
 whose duties include planting new     
 trees, and protecting the area from   
 abuse by people and vehicles.         </content>
