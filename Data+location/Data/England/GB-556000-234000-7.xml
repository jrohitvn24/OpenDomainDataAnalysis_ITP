		<title>07Junior Outing from Wimbish</title>
		<content> On July 5th all the school children   
 from classes 1 and 2 enjoyed a day's  
 outing to the Colne Valley Railway,   
 Castle Hedingham, Essex. The          
 station, rolling stock and lines      
 have been placed there as a           
 railway museum.The children,          
 particularly the boys, enjoyed the old
 steam trains and the signal box. Their
 favourite was the Pullman Carriage,   
 probably used by Royalty in the past  
 when travelling to Brighton in Sussex.
 The picnic in the field was popular,  
 and the sighting of a toad created    
 some interest. After lunch there was a
 ride on the museum railbus. Then the  
 children went to the nearby Castle    
 where they saw dungeons and turrets.  
 The skull of a deer on the wall helped
 to fire their imaginations into ideas 
 of ghostly experiences.
