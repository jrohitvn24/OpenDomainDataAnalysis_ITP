		<content> The coal taken from the Buckhead      
 site is of good quality and is being  
 extracted at a profitable rate.       
 Although there are faults in the      
 seams,there have been no real problems
 and some of the first land used has   
 already been restored to its owners   
 for restricted use.                   
   The coal from this site is not      
 suitable for domestic use but is ideal
 for power stations but some is        
 exported.Approximately 4,600 tonnes of
 coal are produced each week from the  
 site.A fascinating selection of       
 machines are used on the site,some    
 like the earth scrapers,bulldozers and
 draglines being immensely powerful.   
 They are operated with amazing        
 dexterity.Some interesting stones and 
 fossils have been found and several   
 old mine workings have been exposed.
