		<content>{THE MERLEY COMMUNITY ASSOC.}has been  
 building their own centre for 7yrs. It
 has all been  done by a  maximum of 15
 volunteers,who  re-erected the old Ham
 -worthy Engineering Sports Club,bought
 for Â£500.It cost Â£2000 to move it.The 
 land was given by Poole Borough Coun- 
 cil.The original wooden building is   
 now having a brick skin built for sec-
 urity and against fire risk.The hall  
 will be large enough for Badminton &amp; 5
 -a-side football.The first event held 
 was the Merley Country Show held on   
 7th Sept 1985,before building was fin-
 ished,see slide.Fund raising is still 
 needed,collecting &amp; selling old paper 
 is one way.A Social Club &amp; bar within 
 the Comm.Assoc.is Â£1 per year.A kitch-
 en is being equipped,&amp; heating has yet
 to be installed.Future events will be 
 Soup &amp; Carols at Xmas &amp; an Xmas Fair. 
 The Centre will open fully in 1986.   </content>
