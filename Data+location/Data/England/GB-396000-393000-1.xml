		<title>01 HATTERSLEY-THE AREA.</title>
		<content>                                       
    Until the Hattersley Estate was    
built this area was mainly farmland    
and country park land.  The name       
Hattersley is said to come from        
{Hatha's Ley} - Hatha being a Viking   
name.                                  
    The first day school in Hyde was   
at Hattersley. It was held in Sundial  
Cottage. The cottage was demolished in 
l976.                                  
      Hattersley is now a large typical
overspill estate on the edge of        
Greater Manchester where the people    
have been transported from and urban   
environment to a semi-rural one.       
      Hattersley lies about l0 miles   
east of Manchester on the main route to
Sheffield. Its closest village is      
Mottram and the nearest small towns.
