		<title>11HOUSING IN GROVE</title>
		<content>GROVE WAS A VERY SMALL VILLAGE 20 YEARS
AGO. BUT NOW GROVE HAS INCREASED A LOT.
GROVE IS THE 2nd BIGGEST VILLAGE IN    
EUROPE. IT IS NEARLY AS BIG AS WANTAGE.
WE HAVE 2 LARGE ESTATES.  SEMI         
DETACHED  HOUSES ARE MOST COMMON IN    
GROVE. TERRACED HOUSES ARE QUITE       
COMMON BUT NOT AS COMMON AS SEMI       
DETACHED HOUSES.FLATS ARE NOT AS       
COMMON AS ANY TYPE OF  HOUSE. THE MOST 
COMMON APPLIANCES USED IN HOMES        
ARE OVENS,HOOVERS,TVs,FRIDGES,         
FREEZERS, VIDEOS, AND MANY THINGS LIKE 
THIS.MOST HOMES HAVE A GARDEN AND A    
GARAGE. THE NEW HOUSES ARE BUILT OUT   
OF BRICK WITH TILED ROOFS.SOME         
PREFABRICATED HOUSES ARE BEING BUILT.  
THERE ARE STILL SOME OLD THATCHED      
COTTAGES IN THE VILLAGE.
