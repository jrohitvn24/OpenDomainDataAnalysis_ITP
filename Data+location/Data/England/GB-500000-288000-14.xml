		<content>There are three classes in the school  
and we are in class 3.   There is a    
school bus and it stops in Oundle and  
Southwick.   We can have school        
dinners or sandwiches.   Mrs.Pridmore  
is our dinner lady.   We have roasts   
and sausages and chips, for puddings we
have biscuits, cake, crumble, semolina,
rice pudding and tart.   We have three 
playtimes, one in the morning, one at  
lunchtime and one in the afternoon.    
In the winter the boys do football and 
the girls do netball, in the summer we 
do rounders.   The teachers are called 
Mrs. Green, Mrs. Machin and Mr. Palmer 
who is the headmaster.   Mrs. Green    
teaches class 1, Mrs. Machin teaches   
class 2 and Mr. Palmer teaches class 3.
Some of the lessons we do are English, 
Maths, Social Studies, Nature and      
Science. We also do swimming, cookery, 
country dancing and gym.               </content>
