		<content> The area is Grade 3 agricultural      
 land.The soils are heavy clay loams on
 the boulder clay and light,sandier    
 soils on the alluvium.The area is     
 sensitive to change.Intensive farming 
 has resulted in the loss of           
 hedgerows,trees and meadows in the    
 shift from mixed farming to cereal    
 production.Today,the remaining        
 woodland is of particular landscape   
 and wildlife value and should be      
 conserved and added to in the         
 future.Other pressures may come from  
 gravel extraction from the valley     
 floor and from the fact that the river
 is vital to water supply and          
 drainage.Works to replace the sluices 
 at Turvey are proposed in the future  
 as part of the Anglian Water          
 Authority's drainage improvement of   
 the Great Ouse.Care will be needed to 
 avoid loss of wildlife and landscape. </content>
