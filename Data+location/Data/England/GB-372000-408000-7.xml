		<content>  When I wake up I shut my door because
 my parents like to lie in. I play with
 my "Transformers" until my mum calls  
 me down for a snack. I play with my   
 favourite games," Chukie Egg 2" and   
 "Mr.Do." I get dressed and phone my   
 friend to see if he is playing. We    
 play "Transformers" and then I have a 
 cooked breakfast.I get my swimming    
 pool out.We use the hot and cold taps.
 I hold one hose pipe and my           
 sister the other, the we have dinner  
 before going to town. We pass two     
 pubs.When we get to town I buy        
 something while my mum buys all the   
 food. Then we go home and Matthew     
 comes to play with me. We have tea and
 play tennis before I go to bed.
