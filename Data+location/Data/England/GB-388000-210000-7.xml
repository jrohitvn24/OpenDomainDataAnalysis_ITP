		<title>07CRANHAM WOODS</title>
		<content> Cranham Woods cover several square    
 miles  and are owned by Mr. Hicksbeech
 It is mostly beech trees but there are
 other types of trees there. There is a
 stream running through it. On the edge
 of the wood is Sanatorium Road. There 
 are paths and bridleways through the  
 woods. In one wood there is a clearing
  called Monks Ditch, there is a lone  
 house with the same name there as     
 well. There are lots of grey squirrels
 around the woods. There are deer in   
 the woods but they are rarely sighted.
 There is another woodland on the edge 
 of the common where some deer have    
 been sighted. Cranham Woods have a lot
 of wildlife, but people aren't allowed
 to shoot with guns in there, snare    
 s                                     
 are also not allowed. The minimun fine
 for leaving litter is Â£100.
