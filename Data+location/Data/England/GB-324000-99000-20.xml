		<title>20DALWOOD PLAYGROUP.</title>
		<content> There has been a playgroup in Dalwood 
 for over ten years. It was started to 
 support the school when the school was
 threatened with closure due to falling
 rolls. The playgroup is held at the   
 village hall on Tuesdays and Fridays. 
 Until recently the playgroup was run  
 by Mrs Rose Mock. It is now run by Mrs
 Sandy Thorne, assisted by Mrs Jenny   
 Sampson and Mrs Diana Darke.          
 Activities include creative and       
 constructional play,drama and music.  
   At present there are ten children   
 attending the playgroup. Some children
 come from outside Dalwood.            
   The playgroup is affiliated to the  
 National Playgroups Association.
