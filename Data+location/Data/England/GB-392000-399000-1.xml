		<content>    Ashton-under-Lyne is part of the   
 Greater Manchester Metropolitan       
 Borough of Tameside, situated to the  
 east of Manchester on the north bank  
 of the river Tame. It is an           
 old market town (St. Michael's Parish 
 Church is mentioned in the first      
 Domesday Survey) which grew           
 considerably during the industrial    
 revolution due to cotton.             
    The town name derives from the     
 Assheton family who owned the manor   
 during the 14th century; under-Lyne   
 comes from the Pennine uplands area   
 which was once known as Lyme.         
    The following 19 pages were        
 produced by children from 8 different 
 Primary schools within the Ashton Area
 and are intended to portray a flavour 
 of life in our town today.
