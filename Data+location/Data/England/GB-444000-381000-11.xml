		<content>{SCHOOL}In the playground we play at   
 catch,hide and seek,marbles or french 
 skipping.We call french skipping      
 "elastic".The infants often play at   
 "mums and dads","cops and robbers" and
 other police games.                   
{OUTDOORS}At home we play at football  
 or rounders.Nowadays BMX bikes are    
 very popular. They are used for stunts
 in competitions.Outside we often play 
 at "tiggy","kerby","hot rice" and hop-
 scotch.These games are very simple.   
{INDOORS}We play at hide and seek.     
 We also play at "I-spy"and board games
 like Ludo,Snakes and ladders and      
 Monopoly.Girls like to play with "My  
 Little ponies", which are small       
 coloured pony toys with names to match
 the colours, eg:Cotton Candy is a pink
 colour.Girls also play with dolls. Two
 popular dolls are "Cabbage patch kids"
