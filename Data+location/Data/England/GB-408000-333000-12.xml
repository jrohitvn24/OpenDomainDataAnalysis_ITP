A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ANGELA.           
I am ten years old.On Monday I snuggled
down in my thick quilt before school. I
heard my Mum getting up so I got       
up,dressed in my blue school uniform   
and went to the bathroom.When I had    
washed I went downstairs for breakfast 
of Rice Crispies.At 8.20 I walked to   
the bus stop.In school I hung up my    
coat and went to the classroom.Our     
lessons for the day were Class Studies,
Religious Education,Humanities(about   
farming)Maths(I did division),French   
and Music.At dinner we played on the   
grass. At 3.45 we put our chairs up    
and went to the buses.I got home and   
watched telly.                         </content>
