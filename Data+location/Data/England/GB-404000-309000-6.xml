		<content>A Day in the Life of Naomi Game.       
A typical day for me is to get up in a 
morning,go downstairs to have some     
breakfast,I usually have cornflakes and
glass of milk.I then go up-stairs to   
have a wash,clean my teeth and         
sometimes wash my hair.When I have     
finished I get dressed and go to       
school.                                
  School starts at 8.55 a.m. and I     
usually arrive at school at 8.45       
a.m..We have different lessons every   
day but we always have at least one    
lesson of maths and one lesson of      
integrated studies.We have nine lessons
a day.When the bell rings at 3.30p.m.I 
go home,get changed,have a snack before
doing my piano practice.We usually have
dinner at 5.30p.m.                     
  Most nights I do swimming training   
andtwo nights I do gymnastics.Each     
night I go to bed at 9.30p.m..         </content>
