		<title>18 SOCIAL CONCERN OF LITCHAM</title>
		<content>   Although Litcham can be a bit too   
quiet the majority of people wouldn't  
want to live in a town.Many children   
imagined towns to be full of rough     
children on dirty street corners,and   
would prefer to stay in Litcham.Older  
people would like to live nearer to a  
town to save time shopping but wouldn't
want the noise and bustle of a city.   
   Many people have lived in Litcham   
for over ten years,and those who       
haven't don't seem to be planning on   
moving.It is known that people are     
moving in to East Anglia more than most
other counties.In Litcham the people   
moving in are mostly elderly.The people
in this area have a friendly           
reputation.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
