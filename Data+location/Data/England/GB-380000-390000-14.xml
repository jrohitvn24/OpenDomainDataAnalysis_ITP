 Then{Miss Toolan,}the Headmistress,   
 on behalf of the staff, presented     
 Father with a bronze picture of the   
 Holy Family. We thought these presents
 were very appropiate for Father's     
 Silver Jubilee. After Mass it was     
 playtime, but the Junior 4 girls      
 listened to music tapes. Then we      
 played in the playground until 11.45am
 for an early lunch. The people on     
 sandwiches had their lunches in the   
 classrooms. After that we went back   
 outside. Luckily, Rosemary's tape     
 recorder was battery operated, so we  
 just sat around listening to music. At
 1.30pm we came inside to watch a film 
 show. We watched "Peter Pan," "Snow   
 White and the Seven Dwarfs," and      
 "Whistle While You Work."
