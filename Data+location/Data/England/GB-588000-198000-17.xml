		<content> My dad's car is called a Jeep it has  
 four wheel drive and has got big      
 wheels.You can take it over all       
 terrain and you can take the roof off 
 and it is red and black. It has got 4 
 gears and four wheel drive high and   
 low. The engine has 6 cylinders and   
 it can do 90 m.p.h.  My mum's car is  
 an Austin Maestro,it has 5 gears and  
 5 doors and 6 windows with speeds up  
 to 130 M.P.H. The engine has four     
 cylinders.The car is quite small      
 compared to the Jeep although it will 
 seat 5 people. The colour is red.     
 I asked the children in our class     
 about the cars they had.Between them  
 they had 48 cars for 31 children.The  
 most popular makes were Ford with 16  
 then Austin with 6.Other people had   
 lots of different makes.
