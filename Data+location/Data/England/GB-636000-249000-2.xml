		<title>02Butley -The Area Population</title>
		<content>The Black Death in 1349 caused the     
demise of the original village near the
church. Sheep became common in the     
area and the population remained low   
until arable acreage increased in the  
19th Century.                          
The population rose from 250 in 1801 to
a peak in 1861 of 385.  The            
Agricultural depression saw a decline  
to 270 by 1901.                        
After some recovery the decline has    
continued to 195 in 1981.  Recently    
death of the older people has resulted 
in the sale of their houses to people  
from outside Suffolk for use as holiday
homes and to Americans working at the  
nearby twin airbases of Bentwaters and 
Woodbridge.  An aging local population 
with 45% over the age of 45 and this   
has had a serious effect on school     
rolls.  Few people move permanently    
into the area.                         </content>
