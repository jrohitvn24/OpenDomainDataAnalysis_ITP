<title>21Five Crosses Farm Frodsham</title>
<content>

Five Crosses Farm ceased to be an intact farm about twelve years ago (circa 1998) and dairy production ceased. Although the fields are still used for crops and animals (currently sheep and horses), the farm house was divided into two separate properties. The larger part of the farm house was sold to a local doctor as a private home. Subsequently the barns were developed and sold as three separate barn conversion properties for private residence. Some of the people who used to work on the farm and farm buildings, or delivered to and from the farm still live locally in Frodsham and Helsby. When it was a farm, marl from the local marl pit (which is now a wooded tourist path) was put on the fields and grass grows more strongly in those areas.   &lt;br />
