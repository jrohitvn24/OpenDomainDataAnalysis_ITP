		<title>01Farmland West of Huntingdon</title>
		<content> This block is bounded in the north by 
 farmland &amp; on the east side by farm-  
 land &amp; a small part of the village of 
 Brampton. More farmland to the south  
 but also Brampton Wood designated as a
 conservation Area. In the west, part  
 of the village of Ellington and the   
 tiny hamlet of Ellington Thorpe.  Two 
 way busy roads run through the block, 
 the A604 east to Kettering &amp; west to  
 Cambridge &amp; the A1, the main trunk    
 road from London to the north east of 
 England. In spite of its isolation &amp;  
 lack of shools, Doctor &amp; Dentist, the 
 population of Ellington has doubled in
 the last 10 yrs.  Virtually all the   
 working population commutes by car,   
 some going as far afield as London,   
 Cambridge &amp; Peterborough. Every effort
 however, has been made to maintain &amp;  
 foster the identity of the village as 
 a caring community.                   </content>
