		<content>   New Housing Estate in Newport.      
  Six years ago,it was decided to build
 a second housing development in       
 Newport.A grass field that was used to
 graze cattle in and in which the local
 village agricultural show was held    
 annually,was sold for building a new  
 estate.The roads in the estate are    
 named in a country tradition,such     
 as,Black Thorn Close and Meadow       
 Lane.Some of the houses are detatched 
 but most are semi-detatched.          
  Already foundations are being dug in 
 the field adjoining to extend the     
 housing development further.At the    
 moment there are about seventy houses 
 on this estate.                       
  This estate is built at the eastern  
 end of the village.It is built between
 the A63 which runs through the village
 and the M62.The motorway traffic can  
 be heard but not seen. Tiffany Reed.  </content>
