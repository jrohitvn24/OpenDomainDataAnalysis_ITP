		<title>01Description of Adisham Area</title>
		<content>    Adisham village lies in a hollow   
of the chalk Kentish Downs about 125   
feet above sea level, approximately six
miles from Canterbury, nine from Sand- 
wich.  To reach it means passing along 
roads that wind through undulating     
open landscape of corn fields          
stretching to far distant woodlands.   
Trees line the railway line cutting    
almost diagonally through the area.    
Wind sweeps across the high ground     
rising to 250 feet, a golden vista     
in autumn.  Cows and sheep graze near  
the village.  The Church stands high   
overlooking the green beyond which     
lies the long straggling street of     
mainly modern houses. A council estate 
is opposite the green.  Bloodden runs  
parallel to the village street con-    
taining a cluster of houses with the   
farm of Little Cooting at the far end. 
Bossington hamlet lies 1/2 mile east.  </content>
