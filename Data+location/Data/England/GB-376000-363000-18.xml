		<content> The next question we put to the       
 populace was:{What do you like about  
{the area?}The answers to this were    
 varied but generally they fell into   
 the same categories.These were : Quiet
 and peaceful surroundings,Village and 
 Community Life having a nice friendly 
 atmosphere.                           
  Unfortunately,people in answer to the
 question:{Are there things in the area
{that you do not like?}These out       
 weighed the good things.They were,No  
 Gas supply in the village,the speed of
 traffic through the village,shortage  
 of a bus-service,lack of concern by   
 dog owners to control their dog's     
 toilet habits on the pavements.       
 Several of the households said they   
 disliked the 'gypsies' on the Heath,  
 and that the Sand Quarry brought in   
 far too many unwanted visitors.
