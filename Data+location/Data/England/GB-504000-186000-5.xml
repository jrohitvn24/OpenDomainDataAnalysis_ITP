		<title>05HOUSING IN ICKENHAM</title>
		<content> Ickenham is mainly a residential area 
 All the houses are privately owned and
 there are no council houses in the    
 area we covered.Most houses have three
 bedrooms,but some have four.          
    Quite a few houses have had        
 extensions or converted garages.      
    Most houses in Ickenham were built 
 in the "1930's" so they are all quite 
 new.                                  
    The area is quite built up but     
 there are a few greenland areas       
 eg.parks,greens etc.                  
    Most of the houses are             
 semi-detatched and cost over Â£50,000 .
    The shops in Ickenham are all small
 stores and most of them are joined    
 onto each other along one side of the 
 road. They all have flats above them  
 in which some of the shopkeepers live.
