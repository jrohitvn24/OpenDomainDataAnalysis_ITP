		<title>12THE COUCIL DEPOT. N.Y.C.C.13</title>
		<content> In Green Hammerton there is a Council 
 Depot for Division l3. We went to see 
 it. There was lots of machinery for   
 winter.Such as salt gritters and snow 
 ploughs.we saw piles of grit.We saw   
 things like kerb stone,gully pots,    
 road sighs.Paraffin lamps to light    
 up road works.There was a Porta loo   
 _a sort of loo of workmen to use and  
 a cabin to make tea in.We brought back
 several cats eyes.They will have once 
 been stuck in the middle of the road. 
 What happens is the car lights        
 reflect on the glass balls they seem  
 to  light up.But if a car runs over   
 them they don't get damaged, because  
 the rubber pad that holds them        
 squashes into the ground.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
