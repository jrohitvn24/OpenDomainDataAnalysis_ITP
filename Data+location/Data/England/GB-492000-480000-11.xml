		<title>11BROMPTON &amp;SAWDON C.P. SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{BROMPTON &amp; SAWDON C.P. SCHOOL }serves 
 the villages of Brompton and Sawdon.  
 The Sawdon children are taxied to     
 school.                               
     The school was built in {1878}of  
 local limestone with a welsh slate    
 roof. It has a bell in a tower which  
 we still ring to call us in at break. 
 There are two main classrooms in the  
 school, the biggest one has a movable 
 partition and is also used for as a   
 dining room. The kitchen was added on 
 after the war. We now use the         
 adjoining school house as an office,  
 library, music room and store room.   
     We have an automatic oil fired    
 burner which helps keep out the cold  
 wind. Our playground is very tiny but 
 we can play cricket in it all the year
 round. The school garden is very tiny 
 but we can play there in good weather 
 because it is mainly grass.           </content>
