		<title>07THE RED HART INN AT AWRE</title>
		<content>{A GROUP OF GIRLS WENT TO VISIT MR     
 HOWLES OF THE RED HART PUB IN         
 AWRE.THEY WENT FIRST TO THE ONLY      
 BAR.SURROUNDING THE BAR WERE BLACK    
 TABLES WITH MENUS ON THEM.ON THE WALLS
 WERE A COLLECTION OF MODERN CLOCKS    
 DESIGNED AS SCULPTURES AND MADE BY AN 
 AWRE CRAFTSMAN.THEY WERE FOR          
 SALE.THERE WERE MANY OLD PHOTOGRAPHS  
 OF THE NINETEEN TWENTIES.BEHIND THE   
 BAR IS A CELLAR.ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY   
 COLD THE REAL ALE IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP
 IN THE SUMMER.WE SAW TWO BIG METAL    
 BARRELS WITH GREEN TUBES LEADING TO   
 THE BAR.MR HOWLE CLEANS THESE EVERY   
 DAY.FROM THE CELLAR STAIRS GO UP TO   
 THE LIVING QUARTERS.THE PUB WAS       
 ORIGINALLY A COTTAGE FOR THE WORKMEN  
 WHO WERE REPAIRING ST ANDREWS CHURCH  
 IN THE EARLY SEVENTH CENTURY.THEN IT  
 WAS USED AS AN ORDINARY HOUSE UNTIL   
 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.               </content>
