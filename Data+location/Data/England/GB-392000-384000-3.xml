		<content>     We found out that the church still
 plays an important part in the life of
 both communities. Both churches are   
 called after St.Thomas. {Norbury,Hazel
{Grove}was built in 1834 and{High Lane 
 in 1855. They both served fairly small
 villages.  The church in{High Lane}was
 the only place of worship.  Both      
 churches were centres not only of     
 worship, but also leisure.Today there 
 are churches of all denominations in  
 both villages and many people are     
 associated with a large number of     
 organisations connected with the      
 churches eg.Cubs,Brownies Scouts,     
 Guides ,C.L.B, W.I,Womens Union,Mens  
 Groups etc. Norbury Church opened in  
 1985 a Narthex costing over Â£200,000. 
 Many people may not go to church in   
 present times, but the churches are   
 still important.
