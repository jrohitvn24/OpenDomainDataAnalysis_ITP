		<content>  We spoke to people who had lived in  
 the village for a long time to find   
 out how it was changing. We found that
 although the{woodlands}around the     
 village have not changed much, many of
 the{fields}have been made larger by   
 taking out the hedges.{The centre}of  
 the village is a{conservation area}so 
 there has been little change to the   
 look of the beautiful black and white 
{buildings}though one or two cottages  
 have gone. Some of the{shops}have     
 changed. There used to be two bakers, 
 now there is one. There was a         
 haberdashery and even a bank. The P.O.
 has moved. The best change was the    
{by-pass.}The village street is quite  
 peaceful now. There was a time when   
 there were often traffic jams and the 
 buildings were dirty.Some people said 
 that{village children}do not seem to  
 play out so much now because of T.V.  </content>
