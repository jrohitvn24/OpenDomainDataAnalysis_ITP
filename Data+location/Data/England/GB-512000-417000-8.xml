		<content> This is the story of the Witch of     
 Kettlebridge.                         
   Once, many years ago, there was a   
 young girl of about 19. She was       
 accused of being a witch. She was     
 taken to Thornton Abbey and held there
 while a cauldron was made which they  
 called a kettle. She was then taken   
 along a tunnel which was said to go   
 from the Abbey to Manor Farm in East  
 Halton.Then she was burnt in the      
 cauldron near a bridge.Before she was 
 burnt she put a curse on the cauldron.
 Her ashes were taken to Manor Farm to 
 be kept there in the cauldron for     
 ever.                                 
   It is said that some people did     
 touch the cauldron and nasty things   
 happened to them.It has now been      
 blocked up.                           
    There is a variation on this story 
 under Folklore 2.                     </content>
