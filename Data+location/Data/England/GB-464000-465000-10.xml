		<title>10SHERIFF HUTTON AT WORK</title>
		<content> A large percent of workers travel to  
 York where British Rail,Rowntree's and
 numerous other firms provide          
 employment.Young people often find    
 travel difficult,resulting in them    
 leaving the village to find           
 accommodation nearer their work.The   
 work on farms is done by the owners,  
 plus a small number of farmworkers.A  
 stable for race horses provides around
 24 jobs.Part time work is avilable in 
 two of the shops in the village.Quit a
 number are self employed.Postal       
 services gives employment to 5 people.
 Unemployment is confined to the       
 younger generation,not much work for  
 this age group is to be found locally.
 Potato harvesting brings casual work  
 once a year.Both garages employ local 
 mechanics,but the light industry      
 units at the edge of the village      
 provides no work for the local people.</content>
