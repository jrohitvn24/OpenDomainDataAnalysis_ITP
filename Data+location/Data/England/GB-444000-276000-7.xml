    The housing in Long Lawford is     
 neither exceptionally old or new. The 
 oldest building in the village is the 
 church, followed by a small terrace of
 old houses called the Laurel Cottages 
 completed in 1885. These, however, are
 exceptions, as are the houses near    
 Round Avenue still under construction.
    To begin with the village consisted
 of mostly private houses centred      
 around three major streets.           
    Many of the houses were built after
 the war, under a plan by the poor     
 Goverement to put up many council and 
 prefabricated houses due to the demand
 for homes.Strangely enough only six   
 prefabricated houses were built and   
 concentration went to more permanent  
 council-owned dwellings.
