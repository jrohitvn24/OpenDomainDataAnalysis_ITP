		<title>09Elderly People in Pin Green.</title>
		<content>  {Martin's House}is a home at the{Oval
 for old people who need some help.The 
{Warden}works 8 hours a day;all the    
 workers wear a pink, dark pink or a   
 green dress.Many of the retired       
 people (aged from 65 to 98) have      
 difficulty getting into{baths},so they
 have a special bath called a medic    
 bath;it has a door so the retired     
 person can go in and sit inside to    
 have a bath.Their favourite meals are 
 roast dinners and shepherd's pie.     
   The{Bulldog Flats at St.Nicholas    
 are for independent elderly people.In 
 every room there is an emergency alarm
 so if anyone has an accident,they pull
 a string and it sets off the alarm and
 red lights begin to flash,so the      
 warden can help. She can speak to each
 person each day by radio,too.In the   
 main room was a radio,t.v.,books,a    
 recordplayer and some games.          </content>
