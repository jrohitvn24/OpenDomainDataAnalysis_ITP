		<title>13BISHOP BURTON TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> The busy main road between York and   
 Hull, the{A1079,}with its heavy       
 traffic, passes through the middle of 
 Bishop Burton village and skirts the  
 village's main pond. But providing a  
 bypass for the village has been given 
 low priority by the County Council.   
 About 70% of villagers have cars.     
 There is{one bus service (746) between
{Hull and Leeds}which passes through   
 the village. It runs approximately    
 every two hours which is inconvenient 
 for people who do not possess a car   
 but have to commute to work, but does 
 give old age pensioners some mobility.
 There is some resentment by newcomers 
 to the village, who are unused to     
 rural life, to farmers' slurry        
 tankers, trailers, tractors and       
 livestock lorries going through the   
 village and delaying traffic.
