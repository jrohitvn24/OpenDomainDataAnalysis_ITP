		<content>   The villages of Barnston, Little    
 Dunmow and Felsted each have their own
 Parish Council dealing with local     
 affairs such as footpaths, street     
 lighting, village halls, etc.  This   
 Council is elected from local people  
 by local people and the normal term of
 office is three years.                
                                       
   The wider issues of the villages    
 such as planning, roads, etc., are    
 controlled and administrated by the   
 Uttlesford District Council, which in 
 its self is a division of Essex County
 Council.                              
                                       
   The area forms part of the rural    
 parliamentary constituency of Saffron 
 Walden and is represented by a        
 Conservative M.P., Mr. Alan           
 Haselhurst.
