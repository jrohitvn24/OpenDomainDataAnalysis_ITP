 The Saxon church was extended as the  
 castle of Elmley grew in importance.In
 the thirteenth century the nave was   
 extended and the tower added.Some     
 Saxon herringbone work can still be   
 seen.In 1340 the north transept(now   
 containing the Savage tomb) and the   
 South aisle were added and the chancel
 lengthened.In 1544 the height of the  
 north transept was increased.The oak  
 pews were added around 1575.There are 
 excellent examples of Norman,Early    
 English,Perpendicular and Decorated   
 architecture.The font is twelfth      
 century.There is modern controversial 
 painting of the "Pregnant Madonna" by 
 Donald Pass.Minor recent reorder of   
 the interior has opened up the chancel
 arch.The churchyard contains two      
 sundials from the sixteenth century.  </content>
