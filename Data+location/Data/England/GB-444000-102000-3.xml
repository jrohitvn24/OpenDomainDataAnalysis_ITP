		<content>    Ashlett Creek is a small waterside 
 area on the edge of Southampton       
 waters,a tide mill was built by French
 soldiers during the time of Napoleon. 
    Behind the mill a small millpond   
 still remains,this stored the seawater
 when the tide came in so that the mill
 could work when the tide came in and  
 out. The mill was used to grind corn. 
    It is now a social club owned by   
 ESSO Refinery.
