		<content>   Baker Street is the only place in   
 the area of Orsett boasting any       
 industry other than farming. Along the
 street can be found a Hostel for Young
 Ladies, The Foxhound Riding Stables   
 and a newly opened garden centre.     
     The owner of the stables rents    
 land in Fen Lane where a number of    
 jumps and hurdles can be seen. The    
 stables employs six full time staff.  
 They are open from 8am to 8pm.        
     Close by a garage can be found. It
 is built on a worked out sand and     
 ballast pit. The garage has been there
 for forty years. The owners live in a 
 house next to the garage which is     
 twenty years old.The garage does car  
 repairs and sells about 6000 gallons  
 of petrol per week.                   
  Baker Street gets its name from      
 J.Baker owner of Orsett Estate at the 
 time of The Great Fire of London.     </content>
