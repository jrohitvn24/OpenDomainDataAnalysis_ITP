		<title>11The DRG  Factory. Kingswood.</title>
		<content>  The large red brick factory in       
 Carsons Road, Mangotsfield was built  
 in 1910 as a{Carson's Chocolate       
{factory.}In the 1960's it was taken   
 over by the{Dickinson Robinson Group  
 as one of their many factories in the 
 Bristol area which make{paper         
{products.}At Mangotsfield they make   
 and store paper on huge rollers, e.g. 
{cling film.}They have built a new     
 factory building on the site which    
 contains their offices and an         
 air-sealed hygienic unit. The old and 
 new factory buildings are connected   
 via elevated tunnels. The special     
 sealed unit produces{sterile          
{flex-packs}which are for use in       
 hospitals. The product must be kept   
 clean so, the unit has an entrance    
 chamber where the workers change into 
{special overalls}to prevent the risk  
 of contamination.                     </content>
