 is surrounded by farms of which 54 are
 to be found within a 5 kilometre      
 radius of the town centre.            
   {Farming}is nearly all{dairy.}The   
 main breed of cattle is Friesian.They 
 are kept for their milk which also    
 means that the main crop grown is     
 grass.The cattle either eat it in the 
 field or are fed it as hay in Winter. 
 The winter housing of cattle in       
 cubicles gives rise to unpleasent     
 smells drifting over domestic areas   
 when the cattles waste,called slurry, 
 is removed and spread over the        
 fields as fertiliser.Slurry is liquid 
 manure and is stored in large ponds   
 called lagoons.                       
   In Nantwich there is one dairy and  
 three shops specialising in{dairy     
{products}including milk,cream and of  
 course,{Cheshire cheese.              </content>
