		<content>    There were many suggestions for    
 improving life in the area.  The most 
 popular centred on traffic, transport,
 smells and derelict houses. Most      
 wanted some easing of heavy traffic   
 through Podington.  Some even         
 suggested closure except for access.  
 Better public transport was a common  
 plea. Many complained about the       
 smells and the flies from the maggot  
 farm.  Most felt that the villages    
 would benefit if derelict houses could
 be modernised and lived in. Many want 
 building restrictions lifted so some  
 smaller houses could be built for     
 young families.  Other suggestions    
 were for  better amenities such as    
 mains gas, tennis courts, bowling     
 green, pre- school facilities and a   
 Sunday School and a revival of old    
 crafts and customs, closure of maggot 
 farm and Santa Pod.                   </content>
