		<content>    The area we are covering for our   
 Domesday Project covers a part of     
 Herefordshire long famous for the     
 quality of its agricultural land.     
   To the west the land is rising      
 gently to Eccleswall then falls to a  
 valley which runs from north to south.
 In the valley floor the fields are    
 large and suitable for growing crops. 
 The land then rises again more sharply
 to Linton Ridge where the fields      
 become smaller and more suitable for  
 keeping animals.                      
   There are many farms marked on our  
 maps but many of them are no longer   
 working farms.Hownhall for example    
 used to be a fruit farm but has sold  
 most of its land,to local farmers and 
 to a cider factory.Its barns have been
 sold for development and its present  
 owners have kept two and a half acres 
 and run it as a bed and breakfast.    </content>
