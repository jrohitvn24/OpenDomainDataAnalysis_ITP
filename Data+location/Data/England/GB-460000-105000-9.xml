		<title>09HOUSEWIFE OF PENSIONABLE AGE</title>
		<content> Lived in Portchester for thirty four  
 years although she is Australian by   
 birth and British by adoption.  Her   
 main problem is one of increasing age.
 One national problem is "moonlighting"
 by people.  This is when people do not
 pay taxes for jobs they do.  This is  
 unfair on others because it means they
 have to pay more to account for the   
 deficit caused by the "moonlighters". 
 She sees no solution unless people    
 become more honest, but it is         
 impossible to transform human nature. 
 Local problems are vandalism, caused  
 by lack of discipline at all levels.  
 She does not think society is changing
 for the better, as people, and young  
 people in particular seem to have     
 little respect for anything or anyone.
