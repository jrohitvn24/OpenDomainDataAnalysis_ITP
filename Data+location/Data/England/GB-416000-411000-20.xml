		<title>20SMITH'S FARM</title>
		<content> The farm was built in the early 1800's
 The land covers about 36 acres and is 
 all grazing land which his 46 cows    
 use. Also he rents 5 acres. His other 
 animals include 20 pigs, a dog, some  
 cats and a few hens. All of his cows  
 and pigs go to market to be sold and  
 killed for meat.                      
 Mr Smith has been farming for 40 years
 When he was young he kept a few pigs, 
 but farming has never run in his      
 family.                               
 He has not kept milking cows for 12   
 years.In winter the cattle come       
 indoors until the weather gets warm.  
 Mr Smith owns 2 tractors and all the  
 equipment for haymaking. He employs   
 extra helpers at hay time, but the    
 rest of the time he and his wife do   
 the work.
