		<title>14A Holiday Home</title>
		<content>   {Skylarks}is a holiday home for     
 disabled people. It is run by the     
{Winged Fellowship Trust.}The          
 attractive modern building is on Holme
 Pierrepont Lane. From the home there  
 are lovely views over the river valley
 to Nottingham and Colwick woods.      
    Disabled people can come to        
{Skylarks}for one or two weeks holiday 
 in the year. The staff and volunteers 
 look after them and help them and take
 them out  for various activities. As  
 they are near the Watersports Centre  
 they can use the facilities there.    
    Our school has raised money to help
{Skylarks.}We have had a competition to
 grow the biggest sunflower and asked  
 people to sponser us for each         
 centimetre of the flower.
