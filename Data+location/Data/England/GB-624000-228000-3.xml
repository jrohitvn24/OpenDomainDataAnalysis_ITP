		<title>03Dovercourt Swimming pool</title>
		<content>{In 1984 Dovercourt's first indoor     
{swimming pool}was built by the local  
 council. It is adjacent to the sea and
 cost Â£300,000 to build. It is         
 constructed on a raised platform to   
 give easy access for repairs and      
 maintenance. It opened in Nov 1984.   
 Schools use the pool during term time.
   The pool has recently started a     
 swimming club to encourage young      
 people to improve their swimming      
 techniques and to gain lenth and grade
 badges. They also run a club          
 competition and are planning to have a
 club gala. They offer preliminary     
 sub_aqua diving training. The disabled
 can use the pool on Saturday mornings.
   The pool is a popular recreational  
 facility.The manager is waiting to see
 how many holidaymakers will use it in 
 its first summer.
