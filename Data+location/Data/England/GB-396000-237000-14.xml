		<title>14STRAW BURNING IN ASHTON</title>
		<content>   As I sit in my garden chair after a 
 busy plum picking session, an acrid   
 smoke and the crackle of burning straw
 disturbs my peace. Looking towards    
 Broadway Tower a dark blue haze       
 obscures the view and my heart sinks. 
 More hedgerows burned up, trees       
 singed, insects and wild flowers      
 destroyed. I know the lady living in a
 thatched cottage will be hoping that  
 stray sparks will not ignite her roof.
 The air is filled with black smuts and
 the nauseous smell of burnt           
 vegetation. Farmers have been asked to
 follow government directives on how to
 dispose of straw, but in this area    
 these directives are usually ignored. 
 Many ways of using straw have been    
 suggested, the latest being the       
 "stropper" machine, which, using a    
 caustic soda treatment can turn straw 
 into cattle feed. Is there hope yet?  </content>
