		<content> APART FROM THE SETTLEMENTS,           
 APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PER CENT OF THE   
 BLOCK IS FARMED, COMPRISING CULTIVATED
 LAND AND GRASSLAND. WOODLAND AND      
 MOORLAND COVER ALMOST ALL OF THE      
 REMAINDER. THE WOODLAND IS MOSTLY     
 NATURAL DECIDUOUS, AND THERE ARE FOUR 
 SMALL CONIFEROUS PLANTATIONS WHICH    
 INCLUDE THE PLANTING ROUND THE        
 RESERVOIR AT LOCKWOOD BECK. THE       
 RESERVOIR IS SUPPLIED BY WATER DRAINED
 DOWN FROM THE MOOR, AND USED TO BE    
 SUFFICIENT TO SUPPLY THE WHOLE OF EAST
 CLEVELAND; NOW IT IS ONLY USED TO     
 SUPPLEMENT A LARGER RESERVOIR. THE    
 MOORLAND IS UPLAND HEATHER-DOMINATED  
 MOORLAND USED FOR SHEEP-GRAZING AND   
 GROUSE SHOOTING. AROUND THE           
 SETTLEMENTS, PARTICULARLY AT MARGROVE 
 PART AND CHARLTON, SOME LAND IS USED  
 FOR ALLOTMENTS, WHERE VEGETABLES ARE  
 GROWN AND PIGS, GOATS AND POULTRY KEPT</content>
