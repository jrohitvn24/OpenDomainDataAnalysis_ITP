		<title>13Gravel Proposal, Bridgham</title>
		<content> In Spring l985, Bridgham's peaceful   
 existence was shaken by notification  
 of the biggest threat ever to have    
 challenged its rural, undisturbed way 
 of life.  Atlas Aggregates applied to 
 Norfolk County Council for planning   
 permission to extract sand and gravel 
 from a 50 acre site over a period of  
 15+ years.  The site (Stonehouse Farm)
 lies within East Harling parish to our
 east.  However, the land lies in much 
 closer proximity to Bridgham, running 
 along the southern side of the River  
 Thet; our houses lie to the north of  
 the river.                            
                                       
 Stonehouse Farm had previously        
 belonged to the Forestry Commision    
 who, under government pressure to sell
 less profitable acres, sold the land  
 to Atlas Aggregates for a large sum.
