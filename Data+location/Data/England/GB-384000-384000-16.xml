		<content> Close to where we live there is a     
 Hospice. It is called St.Anne's       
 Hospice. People who are very ill are  
 cared for by the Nurses. Inside the   
 Hospice it is light and cheerful with 
 flowers and pretty curtains.  Everyone
 is very happy there and the Matron and
 Nurses all enjoy their work.  The     
 Hospice always needs money so         
 everytime we hold an event like a     
 Christmas Concert, we have a          
 collection for them.  Everybody in    
 Heald Green is very proud of the work 
 done at St.Anne's and everyone always 
 gives to this charity. There is also  
 another Hospital called Cheadle       
 Royal. The patients there are quite   
 fit in their bodies but are feeling   
 depressed or confused in their minds. 
 Some of the patients stay in wards and
 others are Outpatients.It is quite a  
 large Hospital with its own Church.   </content>
