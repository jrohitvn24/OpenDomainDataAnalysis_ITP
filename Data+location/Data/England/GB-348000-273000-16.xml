		<content>  Tourists from home and abroad are    
 attracted by the historic buildings of
 Ludlow and the surrounding            
 countryside.                          
  Whitcliffe common offers a wide view 
 of the town and there is fishing and  
 boating on the River Teme.            
  Ludlow has examples of many periods  
 of architecture - Ludlow Castle,where 
 a Shakespearean play is performed     
 every summer,the Feathers Hotel,St.   
 Lawrences church,Georgian buildings in
 Mill street and a Victorian Town Hall.
  Perhaps the most famous street in    
 Ludlow is Broad Street with the Butter

 bottom.                               
  Many people come to Ludlow to study  
 the famous Geological Fossil trail in 
 nearby Mortimer Forest as well as a   
 base for walking South Shropshire     
 hills.                                </content>
