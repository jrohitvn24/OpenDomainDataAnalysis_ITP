		<title>11ROSEL TWINNED WITH GOODLEIGH</title>
		<content> Goodleigh is twinned with Rosel in    
 France. One year people from Goodleigh
 go to Rosel and the next people from  
 Rosel come to Goodleigh.We go to      
 Weymouth by coach then we get on a    
 ferry and go to Cherbourg in France   
 which takes us 4 hours. We get back on
 the coach and go to Rosel. We stay for
 5 days in people's houses.Rosel is a  
 little village but has many more      
 people than Goodleigh. They are very  
 nice but tend to shout and argue a lot
 with each other. They have lots of    
 activities for us when we get there   
 like barbeque's games etc.The French  
 drink lots of beer and wine.They eat  
 snail soup,fruit and Pizza.
