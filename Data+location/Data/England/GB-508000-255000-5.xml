		<content> Around the area, very little old      
 meadowland remains, apart from the old
 cricket field beside Manor Farm House.
 Wild flowers were found there which   
 might not have survived in fertilized 
 fields.A length of roadside verge in  
 the area free from pesticide provides 
 a natural habitat for unusual flowers 
 too.  It escapes regular verge cutting
 until after the flowers have bloomed. 
                                       
{TREES }are of prime importance to both
 wildlife and the visual environment of
 the village landscape. Dutch Elm      
 disease has taken a heavy toll. Some  
 outstanding mature trees remain in the
 churchyard and Old Rectory,-home to a 
 local colony of rooks.                
 Another well-loved tree is the horse  
 -chesnut in the school grounds. The   
 leaf has been adopted as the school   
 'Logo.'                               </content>
