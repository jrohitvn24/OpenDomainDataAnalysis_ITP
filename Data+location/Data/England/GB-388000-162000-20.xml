		<title>20HOBBIES IN MELKSHAM</title>
		<content>   My hobby is collecting pen knives.  
 I have 24 of them, including 2 sheath 
 knives.  I 2 with 5 blades.  My other 
 hobby is swimming.  I go swimming some
 weekends and in school and also at the
 coast.  I have lots of badges for     
 swimming the furthest; I can swim 16  
 lengths of Calne pool.  My last hobby 
 is shooting.  I have 2 guns of my own 
 and my dad has 8 of them.  We buy a   
 lot of cartridges and we go shooting a
 lot, mostly at Potterne and Easterton.
 We have shot a lot of rabbits ,       
 pigeons, squirrels, pheasants and     
 partridges.  On Sundays my dad and I  
 like to go clay pigeon shooting.      
 Usually we shoot about 60 cartrdges   
 each and it costs us about Â£3 for the 
 cartridges and 25p per shot at the    
 calys.
