		<title>11THE ENVIRONMENT OF GARFORTH</title>
		<content> Garforth has most of the things a     
 community needs like doctors,         
 dentists, shops and entertainment.    
 People who work out of Garforth can   
 get into work quickly because it is   
 situated on a good transport network  
 which puts many towns and cities      
 within easy reach. More things are    
 needed to entertain teenagers and stop
 vandalism. There are several schools  
 for 5-l8 year olds and the            
 countrysideis within easy walking     
 distance. Garforth has playing fields 
 including cricket, football and rugby 
 clubs also. The disadvantage of       
 Garforth is that it does not have a   
 swimming pool or a B.M.X. course both 
 of which most young people would      
 enjoy.
