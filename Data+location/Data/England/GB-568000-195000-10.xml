		<title>10 A SPECIAL SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    Ramsden Hall is a residential      
 special school for boys of 10-17. It  
 was not always a school as it used to 
 belong to squire Bakem. The hall was  
 built in 1852, but then another wing  
 was built on to it in 1900. It is a   
 delightful property surrounded by open
 fields and woodland.                  
    There are{fifty three}boys there at
 the moment but soon there will be     
 more.There are{seven}teachers who each
 work for four or five hours a day.    
 There is no homework for the boys     
 unless vitally necessary.             
    The school owns fourteen acres of  
 land,upon which there is a small farm.
 They keep goats,chickens, sheep,ducks 
 and rabbits. There is also a horse    
 which they use for riding.They are    
 lucky enough to have an open air      
 swimming pool which they use during   
 the summer.                           </content>
