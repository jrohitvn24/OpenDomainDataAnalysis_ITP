		<title>10SECONDARY SCHOOL AS IT WAS.</title>
		<content> Later school life in Devizes at the   
 beginning of the 20th Century,as told 
 by Mr.Ray Smith.                      
 From the age of eight to ten,Mr.Smith 
 went to Parnella School.(See Page 9)  
 There were two or three state schools 
 in Devizes, but these were            
 overcrowded. By the Market Place was  
 a very grand school, where you had to 
 pay a lot to attend.                  
 At ten, Mr.Smith left Parnella School 
 and went to the Grammar School which  
 was near today's Comprehensive School.
 Here there were about sixty pupils,   
 twenty of whom were 'boarders' and    
 lived at Heathcote House with the     
 headmaster.  The motto of the school  
 was 'Factis non Verbis.'              
 Mr.Smith left school at fourteen      
 and became an apprentice for seven    
 years in a music shop called Handels.
