		<title>11HOUSING IN THE FOXMOOR AREA</title>
		<content> In this area there are houses of all  
 kinds, detached, semi-detached,       
 terraced, cottages, flats and a few   
 farms. Most of the people live        
 on either privately or publicly owned 
 estates.  An estate is a number of    
 houses built to a plan.  Also there is
 an open space in the middle of the    
 estate covered with grass where       
 children play.  The paths in some     
 estates  are only wide enough to let  
 milk floats through.  There are about 
 twelve inlets in big estates where    
 minor roads lead out to major ones.   
 Almost all houses built on estates    
 have wall to wall carpets fitted when 
 they are erected.  In all houses there
 are electric sockets in every room.   
 The kitchens are fitted with a gas or 
 electricity supply.
