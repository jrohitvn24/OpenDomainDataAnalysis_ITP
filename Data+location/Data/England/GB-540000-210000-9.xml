		<content> Roydon has many old houses with       
 weather-boarding fronts. Since the    
 Second World War there has been a lot 
 of building, and a small estate of    
 expensive housing was being built when
 we visited the village.  Roydon is one
 of those areas which is attractive to 
 people with money who wish to get out 
 of Harlow.  Many of those people go to
 London every day to work.             
                                       
                                       
{Little Parndon}                       
                                       
 Most of the houses in Little Parndon  
 have been built since the beginning of
 the new town.  Parndon Hall has been  
 preserved and is now used as the      
 records office for Area Health. The   
 site of Canons is now used as the Club
 House at Canons Brook Golf Course.
