		<title>18Ringo Starr</title>
		<content> When  we were doing  our street survey
 we found out that Ringo Starr was born
 in  Madryn  Street. Ringo's  real name
 was  Richard Starkey  and  he became a
 drummer with the Beatles pop group.   
 Ringo was  born on  7th July 1940, and
 he  was  nicknamed  Ringo  because  he
 wore so many  rings on his fingers. He
 changed his surname because he thought
 that Starkey was too long to be easily
 remembered. The  other  members of the
 Beatles  were  George  Harrison,  Paul
 McCartney and John Lennon.  From  1963
 to 1971 the  Beatles  sold millions of
 records throughout the world.         
 Lennon  and  McCartney wrote many well
 known songs such as "Yellow Submarine"
 "She Loves You" and "Yesterday".      
 In 1971 the Beatles  decided  to split
 up  and  follow  solo  careers.  Ringo
 decided he would become  an  actor and
 he has been in many films.            </content>
