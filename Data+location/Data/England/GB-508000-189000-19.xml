		<content> Every morning my Nan wakes Emma with  
 her early morning cup of tea. She     
 helps her out of bed. Emma has trouble
 getting to the toilet,sometimes she   
 has accidents. Emma is a slow walker  
 and needs a frame.                    
 She sits in her sitting room for her  
 breakfast. She is 83 and rather plump.
 When I go and see Emma she likes to   
 talk about the olden days. My Nan is a
 qualified nurse and prefers to look   
 after old people. My Nan helps her to 
 get dressed and then Emma sits in her 
 armchair and reads the paper until    
 lunch. She has her lunch at one       
 o'clock. Emma watches television in   
 the afternoon and has a sleep for one 
 hour. Emma lives with my Nan because  
 she is kind. Her own family aren't    
 able to look after her.
