		<title>19HOLSWORTHY SHOW</title>
		<content>   The first recorded Holsworthy       
 Agricultural Show was in 1886 and has 
 continued as an annual event apart    
 from the war years up to until today. 
 The Show was originally for animal,   
 butter and cream exhibits.However     
 modern stalls include exhibitions of  
 agricultural machinery , flowers  ,   
 young farmers clubs displays , womens 
 institute displays , show jumping ,   
 local club/school displays and general
 displays.Plus the judging of various  
 types of farm animal including cattle 
 , sheep , horses and pigs.            
      The 1985 Show which was the 90th 
 annual show more than lived up to the 
 reputation it has created for itself .
 The attendance on a cool , rain       
 threatening  day was over 8000 people.
 It was a day for both visitors and    
 farmers alike.The show usually occurs 
 in the month of May.                  </content>
