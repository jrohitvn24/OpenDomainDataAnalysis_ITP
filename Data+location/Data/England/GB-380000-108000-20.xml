		<title>20EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> There is a large number of housewives 
 in the village (39%) but many of them 
 work full or part time. A very small  
 number of people are unemployed, and a
 quarter of the adult population is    
 retired.                              
 A good proportion of village people   
 are agricultural workers, and the     
 majority of the inhabitants either    
 work within the Parish or the         
 surrounding districts.                
 The poultry processing unit within the
 village offers employment to many,    
 and the other two industrial sites,   
 one concerned with concrete and one   
 manufacturing caravans, offer further 
 opportunities for employment.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
