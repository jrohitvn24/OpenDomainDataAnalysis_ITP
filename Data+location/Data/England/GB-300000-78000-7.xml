		<title>07THE EXMOUTH JOURNAL</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr Bazell who, having  
 worked at the Journal for 22 years, is
 now  editor. 35 people are employed by
 the Journal, 10 of whom work the large
 printing machine which prints about   
 20000 papers per hour. Of the 44      
 Journal pages, advertisements take up 
 on average 65%, mostly from Estate    
 Agents. News is coming in all the time
 and there is never a space in the news
 paper. Sometimes stories from the     
 Journal reach the National Press.     
 Different catergories in the paper    
 include sport, music, arts and        
 history. There is also a children's   
 club called the Jay club which has    
 been running for 5 years and is       
 organised by the editor's wife. The   
 Journal was established in 1858 and is
 the biggest weekly newspaper with the 
 largest audited circulation in East   
 Devon. The price of this paper is 12p.</content>
