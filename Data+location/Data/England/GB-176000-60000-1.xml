		<title>01THE PENTIRE/CRANTOCK AREA</title>
		<content> This is a coastal area dependent on   
 Tourism &amp; Farming.  Pentire headland  
 is an extension of{Newquay,}with many 
 hotels and some expensive housing on  
 the southern edge overlooking the{    
{River Gannel. }The area to the south  
 of the Gannel is farmland with{       
{Crantock}village and the hamlet of    
 West Pentire.  There are 3 farms,     
 which also run seasonal Camp Sites,   
 and 2 Caravan Parks.  The coastline,  
 cliffs and estuary are the dominant   
 features with Fistral and Crantock,   
 both large sandy beaches, while Porth 
 Joke is  smaller and less accessible  
                                       
 Fistral and Pentire are managed by the
 Local Council while the estuary, and  
 southward to include Kelsey Head, is  
 managed by the National Trust.  Much  
 of the land is owned by the Duchy of  
 Cornwall.                             </content>
