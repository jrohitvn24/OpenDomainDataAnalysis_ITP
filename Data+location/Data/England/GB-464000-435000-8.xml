		<title>08Pastimes Around Skipwith</title>
		<content>    Although the area lacks a public   
 park or sports and recreation ground, 
 a wide range of leisure activities may
 be enjoyed. The most obvious pastime  
 is birdwatching on Skipwith Common.   
 The tracks around the common are ideal
 for walkers, joggers, horseriders.    
 Some brave souls may be tempted to    
 swim in the washdikes. Sledging down  
 Dane'S hill is popular in winter with 
 local children. The disused airfield  
 runways provide an excellent training 
 ground for learner drivers and plenty 
 of space for model aeroplane          
 enthusiasts. The runways are also a   
 safe place for go-karting. The        
 pleasant country lanes provide good   
 cycle routes. Some people prefer      
 poaching and shooting pheasant. One   
 resident from nearby Riccall uses the 
 common to occasionally practice firing
 his cannon!                           </content>
