		<title>06Little House Farm</title>
		<content> Little House farm is owned by Mr &amp; Mrs
 Miller. There are twenty five acres in
 Ditchingham and another eleven in     
 Thwaite for hay. On the farm they have
 hereford beef cattle because the field
 floods and the soil is poor. We also  
 saw twenty Kerry hill sheep and Meg   
 the sheep dog who tried unsuccessfully
 to round them up.Herefords are red    
 with white faces.Every cow has a      
 calf once a year and the bull calves  
 are sold. Electric Lady came over     
 from Canada by plane and is the mother
 of a baby bull.There are six bull     
 calves, there are three young bulls,  
 three heifer calves, and eighteen     
 breeding cows. This is roughly one    
 animal to one acres. The food is      
 stored in a dutch barn. They eat grass
 and concentrate. The creep feeder     
  containing concentrates can be       
 adjusted so that only the lambs go in.</content>
