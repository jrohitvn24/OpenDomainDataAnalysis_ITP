		<content> Deopham village is situated on the top
 of a 200 feet ridge that slopes to the
 North. The land then rises again to   
 the Watton -Norwich road.Lying in the 
 valley bottom is the small hamlet of  
 Hackford.                             
  Wicklewood is on the north facing    
 slope of the ridge and extends over   
 the ridge to the parishes of Morley   
 Saint Peter and Morley Saint Botolph. 
  In Wicklewood at the bottom of the   
 north facing slope is a small stream  
 which, eventually, joins the Yare     
 river system.This river flows into the
 sea at Yarmouth.                      
  Rivers to the south of the areaflow  
 into the Ouse river system entering   
 the sea near Kings Lynn.The ridge is a
 watershed between the two river       
 systems.
