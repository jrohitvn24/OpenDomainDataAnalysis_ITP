		<title>13A PRIORY CHOIRBOY'S LIFE</title>
		<content>  We are in the Priory Choir,          
 practising three times a week.On      
 a Wednesday we have a short practice,a
 talk with Mr.Rigby,then we play       
 football.On the other days we just    
 sing.We sing for to services each     
 Sunday and practice before each.      
{ After six months you have earned a   
{choir boy's collar to go with the red 
{cassock we all wear;medals are        
{awarded for long_service ;responsible 
{boys can become choir leaders.        
  We get about Â£7.50 every three       
 months that is if we go to nearly all 
 the practices and we don't mess       
 around.If we mess around we lose pay, 
 this year our choir trip is going to  
 Drayton Manor Park.                   
{ Our favourite song is an anthem, the 
{Te Deum which we sang when the Duchess
{of Gloucester came for the 900th      
{Celebration Service. }                </content>
