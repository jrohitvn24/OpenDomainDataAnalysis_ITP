		<title>01Summary of the area.</title>
		<content>   The area around{ALFRED'S TOWER}was a
 centre where many forts and castles   
 were built. In fact there is even a   
 convent and a priory in the area. This
 area was a centre of great historical 
 activity in the past. The prime reason
 that all these historical buildings   
 were constructed in such an area was  
 that the area is hilly and wooded.    
 Therefore it is no wonder there was   
 such building activity in the area.   
 But the land is also fairly flat at   
 the bottom of these steep hills. On   
 these flats there is little wood, but 
 mainly grass fields.There are several 
 farms in the area, indicating that    
 this area is largely used for         
 agriculture. There is one hamlet in   
 the area which has an inn. The area   
 has seven well spaced farms. The trees
 are mainly coniferous but there are a 
 few deciduous areas.                  </content>
