		<title>15VILLAGE CONCERNS</title>
		<content>   THERE ARE TWO INTERLINKED CAUSES FOR
 CONCERN  IN THE  VILLAGE. ONE IS  THE 
 PLAN TO BUILD  NEW  HOUSES IN  SEVERAL
 PARTS OF THE VILLAGE. AGREEMENT IS NOT
 UNIVERSAL OVER THE SITING OF SOME OF  
 THESE. THE ALLOTMENTS, WHICH ARE WELL 
 ESTABLISHED, MAY HAVE TO BE GIVEN UP  
 AND NEW ONES STARTED.NEW SEWERAGE IS  
 NEEDED BEFORE BUILDING CAN BEGIN.     
                                       
   THE OTHER IS THE FALL IN THE NUMBER 
 OF YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE VILLAGE THUS 
 MAKING THE  FUTURE  OF  THE  VILLAGE  
 SCHOOL UNCERTAIN. IT IS HOPED THAT THE
 NEW HOUSES WILL BRING YOUNG FAMILIES  
 TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF SCHOOL     
 CHILDREN.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
