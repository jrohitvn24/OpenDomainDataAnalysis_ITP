		<content>  Shelland village has only 16 houses, 
with only 34 inhabitants.              
  The land is mainly made up of arable 
and woodland.                          
  Most of the land in Shelland is owned
by the farmer at Rockylls Hall.The     
other farmland is owned by the farmer  
at New Farm.                           
  Shelland green is also owned by      
Rockylls Hall.It is private and no-one 
is allowed to walk on it.              
  Shelland Church is one of the only   
churches in England to have a barrel   
organ which is used at Sunday services 
Mr.Brycesson made it around 1805.There 
are 3 barrels,with 12 tunes on each.   
  There has been a church on the site  
since the 1200's.The church is         
dedicated to Charles the Martyr.       
  In 1916 Dr.Bussell was appointed     
chaplin.He bought the church and in    
1936 gave it to the Church of England. </content>
