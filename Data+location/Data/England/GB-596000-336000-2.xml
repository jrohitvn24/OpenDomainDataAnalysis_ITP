		<content>  The village has developed on this    
 site from a ROMAN SETTLEMENT. Pottery 
 and coins have been found near the    
 stream. The name is early Saxon.{     
 Hendringham (the followers of Hendra).
 In mediaeval times there were five    
 seperate manors, each with a Hall and 
 village green, now they are fused into
 one village with the Parish Church at 
 the centre.                           
   Until electricity and sewage came to
 the village in 1952, there were few   
 visitors and the people mostly worked 
 on local farms, or for small building 
 firms, shops, blacksmiths and         
 agricultural engineers.  The village  
 was self sufficient.  Now few work on 
 the land or in the village as the     
 farms are highly mechanised, and the  
 shops have gone.
