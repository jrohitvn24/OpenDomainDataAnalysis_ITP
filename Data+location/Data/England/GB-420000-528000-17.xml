		<title>17CLOSE HOUSE AND ELDON</title>
		<content> These are local examples of run-down, 
 formerly thriving,{mining communities.
 The majority of men would have worked 
 in the nearby{Black Boy Colliery}which
 closed down within the last twenty    
 years.                                
 Only thirty years ago{few}of the      
{houses}in Close House were{equipped   
 with{W.C.s}and the{roads}were{unpaved.
 Now the houses, in typical terraced   
{"pit rows"}have been modernised and   
 the{close-knit community}still        
 survives, though surrounded yet by    
{derelict land}and relics of the old   
{mining industry,-}the public baths    
 (now a car-breaker's yard and         
 warehouse), for example. The former   
{pit heaps}have been{landscaped}and the
 quarry is being filled, used as an    
 industrial refuse tip.                
 Part of this land is now a{gypsy      
 residential{caravan site.             </content>
