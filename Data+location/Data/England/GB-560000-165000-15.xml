		<content>           MEOPHAM MILL                
 Up the stairs we did climb,           
 Just to make this story rhyme,        
 Out the window we did look,           
 As we grabbed a nearby hook,          
 Out onto the surrounding wood,        
 Was where the rest of 1H stood,       
 Clutching onto things in sight,       
 Looking down gave us a fright.....    
 We decided to go up no more,          
 We listened carefully to what the     
 guide said,                           
 A story about a man who is dead,      
 Who used to haunt the Meopham Mill,   
 But now that silly old ghost is still,
 The Mill was built in 1801,           
 And building it was not much fun,     
 It was built by three young brothers, 
 Who were looked after by their Mother,
 They travelled nine miles every day,  
 By horse or by cart or any way!....
