		<title>06COLLEGES IN CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> The college of St.Mary's began in the 
 centre of Cheltenham.It then moved to 
 a building in  St.George's Place      
 called St.Mary's Hall(now called      
 Shaftesbury Hall).In 1931 it bought   
 the area called the Park,which was    
 going to be a zoological garden with a
 lake and a wide walk for the          
 elephants.Originally the college was  
 for training teachers but after it    
 merged with St.Paul's college in 1979.
 It provides many other courses.Our    
 school has a long association with the
 trainee teachers.We also go up to the 
 college for physical education.This is
 always good fun.We get there by bus up
 to the gates,then we walk up past the 
 hall over some ramps and under a      
 bridge building,past the gymnasia out 
 onto the elephant walk and onto the   
 field where we play all kinds of      
 running games and ball games.         </content>
