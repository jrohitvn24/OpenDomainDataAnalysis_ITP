		<title>04ASHPERTON: LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Ashperton is mentioned in the Domesday
 Book as Spertune, the prefix Ash may  
 refer to  nearby water. The farm      
 Walsopthorne (called Wassington) is   
 also listed as a separate manor,      
 Walesapeldor (Waltheof's Apple Tree). 
 There is a castle mound and moat near 
 the church but the stone from the     
 ruins had been removed and used for   
 other local building by the end of the
 eighteenth century. The abandoned     
 Herefordshire and Gloucestershire     
 Canal passes N.E. of the village. It  
 was completed in 1845 towards the end 
 of the Canal Era but was hardly used, 
 partly because of a meagre water      
 supply. There remains an overgrown,   
 deep cutting, a quarter mile length of
 tunnel and a lock-keeper's cottage    
 which has been bought by a canal      
 enthusiast and may be restored.
