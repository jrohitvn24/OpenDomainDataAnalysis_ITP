		<content>   After school,some 30 fourth years go
 to this club.It is held in summer when
 weather and daylight hours are most   
 suitable.It is run by a local         
 policeman and 3 teachers.We are tested
 on our cycling and knowledge of the   
 Highway Code at the end.              
   Our bikes are tested to make sure   
 that brakes work,seats are the right  
 height,chain tension correct.We learn 
 to balance,make an emergency          
 stop,approach a junction and turn     
 right and go round a round_about.They 
 make us safer cyclists and cut down   
 accidents.We use our bikes locally,but
 because they give little protection   
 from weather or other traffic and are 
 slow and often tiring,they may become 
 obsolete.
