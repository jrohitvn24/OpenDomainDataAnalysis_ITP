		<title>08Davenham By-Pass</title>
		<content> The Davenham by-pass is planned to    
 take heavy morning traffic, lorries   
 and cars, going to and from           
 Middlewich, Winsford and Crewe away   
 from the village.                     
 There are advantages and disadvantages
 with each of the 4 alternative routes.
 For instance the green route is the   
 most direct but destroys seven houses 
 and is the most expensive (Â£3.1m).    
 The three red routes destroy only one 
 house but increase the travelling     
 distance by approximately 1.1km and   
 require extra road junctions.  Route C
 is most likely to be the one used     
 because of reduced cost (Â£1.7m) and   
 limited effect on the environment.    
 Most people asked were in favour of   
 the by-pass.  Shopkeepers generally   
 felt that the by-pass won't effect    
 trade too much (but they still don't  
 want it!).                            </content>
