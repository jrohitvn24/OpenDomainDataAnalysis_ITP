 site in 1845.They were occupied by the
 regimental H.Q. and a depot of the    
 20th or{East Devonshire Regiment of   
{Foot}on its move to Lancashire in     
 1873.In 1881 the regiment became the

 were trained at Wellington Barracks,  
 which came to be regarded as the      
 'home' of the regiment until 1961 then
 the depot was moved again.The original
 barracks were demolished in 1969.The  
 building is now also used as a
