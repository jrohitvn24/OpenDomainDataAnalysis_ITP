		<title>07NASH COURT FARM</title>
		<content> Nash Court Farm is owned by a Mr      
 Horne. On this farm there is a rare   
 pedigree of{Romney Sheep}which have   
 been reared here for many,many years. 
                                       
 Within this square there is a         
 temporary cement works, sited where   
 the road passes under the railway     
 line, supplying materials for the{M20 
{Motor-way}extention.                  
                                       
 There are good examples of{Hazel}being
 used to line roads and provide        
 fencing, a feature of this locality.  
                                       
 Several footpaths criss-cross the area
 which is flat and featureless though  
 the ground does rise gradually from   
 South to North.
