 Street and each one has a service on a
 Sunday.                               
      St.Paul's Methodist Church       
 usually has a service starting at     
 10.45am.and St.Nicholas'C.ofE.Church  
 is at 9.30am. or at 6pm.depending on  
 which week in the month it is.There is
 a notice board outside which will tell
 you.                                  
      On the second Sunday in each     
 month the two churches join together  
 at 11o'clock for a service.
