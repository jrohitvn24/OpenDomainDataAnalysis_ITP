		<title>15LORD'S LOT WOOD</title>
		<content> Lord's lot wood is near Capernwray.The
 trees are mainly evergreen.They have  
 dark green,thin,waxy needles and      
 sometimes pinecones.There are Spruce  
 and pinetrees here and dotted around  
 are deciduous trees such as Hazel and 
 Oak.Fire precautions have been        
 taken.There are "witch's brooms" which
 are bundles of sticks to stamp out any
 fire that may begin.Also there are    
 gaps that run up through the trees to 
 prevent the fire spreading.Fire is    
 always{great risk}in a great wood like
 Lord's Lot.There are picnic facilites 
 for the public.There are benches and  
 tables and a parking area off the main
 road.Deer are often seen here along   
 with rabbits and occasionally         
 foxes.The Gamekeeper's Tower is a     
 ruined tower on the  hill looking down
 on Capernwray.
