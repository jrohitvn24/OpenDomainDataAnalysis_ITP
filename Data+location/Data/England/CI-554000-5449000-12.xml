		<title>12La Rocco Tower  (1)</title>
		<content>  {La Rocco Tower}was built on a       
 prominent rock at the low tide mark in
 the middle of St Ouen's Bay.  It was  
 one a series of towers of distinctive 
 Jersey design that were constructed   
 between 1781 and 1800 around the      
 island's coastline in the wake of the 
 almost-successful French invasion of  
 1781.  These towers are usually       
 referred to as{Martello}towers though 
 their design pre-dates the true       
 Martellos by more than 20 years.      
                                       
   During the Second World War, the    
{German occupying forces,}probably more
 by accident than design, used the     
 tower on the odd occasion for target  
 practice for their big 10 cm guns. The
 outer courtyard walls were breached to
 the extent that the sea, over the     
 following 20 years or so, was able to 
 come{near to bringing down the tower. </content>
