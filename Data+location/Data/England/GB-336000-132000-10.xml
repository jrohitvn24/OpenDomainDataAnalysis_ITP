		<title>10Youth Club, Middlezoy</title>
		<content> The Youth Club was reformed in        
 September 1984.There had been a youth 
 club before but it had been stopped.  
 The present youth club is run by Mr   
 Davenport.In the summer they go to the
 village sports field and play rounders
 and in the winter they go into the    
 village hall and play snooker and     
 table tennis.They have a tuck shop    
 which sells drinks and snacks.It      
 starts at 7.00 pm every Tuesday and   
 ends at 9.00 pm.  It is for ten to    
 sixteen year olds. There are a few    
 helpers who take it in turns to help. 
 Sometimes they have some crazy        
 barbecues to raise money. There were  
 about 20 members in 1985.
