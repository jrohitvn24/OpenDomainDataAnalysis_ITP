		<content>It has been a busy and interesting term
at Chedburgh School.  The infants      
visited Ickworth Park for a ramble and 
picnic with Horringer School infants.  
The entire school joined with Whepstead
Horringer and Chevington for a sports  
afternoon at Whepstead and a           
performance of the 'Carnival of the    
Animals' by King Edward VI Upper School
of Bury at Horringer Community Centre. 
An outing to Easton Park Farm brought  
a sunny and enjoyable day and a mini   
fete a grand total of 76 pounds for    
P.T.A. funds.                          
Sports Day rounded off the term nicely 
with the children enjoying the exercise
ice cream and prizes.                  
There is a lot of fun to be had when   
you go to a village school.
