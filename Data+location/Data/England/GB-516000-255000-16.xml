		<content>{ST.NEOTS BYPASS.}The St.Neots Bypass, 
 due to open in 1986 will alleviate    
 many of the traffic problems which    
 affect the centre of St. Neots town.  
 The new road takes a southern route   
 from the A45 near Tythe Farm to the   
 A1 just south of Eaton Socon, crossing
 the River Great Ouse close to the site
 of the old Little Barford Power       
 Station. Although it is only single   
 carriage way it will remove both heavy
 and holiday traffic from the narrow   
 High Street and town bridge.          
{PARKER'S FARM.}This is found on the   
 B1046 and forms part of the Banks     
 Estate. Each July Trials Fields of    
 various cereal crops are viewed by    
 members of the farming fraternity.    
 Parker's Farm is typical of those in  
 the locality being devoted almost     
 entirely to the growing of cereal     
 crops.                                </content>
