		<content>     HEATHERSLAW MILL MUSEUM           
   The flour mill at Heatherslaw was   
 one of a number of water mills which  
 were working on the banks of the River
 Till near Heatherslaw at the beginning
 of this century.About 8 years ago a   
 Trust was formed to restore the mill  
 to working order.The village joiner   
 made a new wheel and the three-storied
 double mill has been fully restored.A 
 complete set of machinery and         
 ancillary gear is in working          
 order,well documented and backed up by
 photographs and mementoes of its      
 past.The mill sells the flour it      
 grinds and it will also grind wheat   
 for local farmers.The granary has been
 turned into a tea room with all the   
 food being baked on the premises.
