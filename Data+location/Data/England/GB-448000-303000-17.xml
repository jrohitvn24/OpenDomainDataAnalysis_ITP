		<content> On Thursday I went to Astill and      
 Jordan, the bus company in our        
 Domesday Project.We were told that the
 company had 2 coaches and 5 double    
 deckers.We asked if they had any lady 
 workers and were told that they used  
 to have one but she got the sack      
 because she had too many              
 accidents.They employ 9 men and       
 provide buses for four schools.The    
 buses are swept out every day and     
 washed when they have some spare time.

 The first vehicle that Mr Astill had  
 in 1920,when he started was an old    
 coal vehicle which he fitted with     
 seats and nicknamed the Cockerel      
 because of the sound which its horn   
 made.The present   garage was built   
 after the last war using an ex-RAF    
 Hanger in Station Road.
