Originally the building was a public   
house called the "Dog &amp; Partridge"inn. 
In the early 1880's,when the Thirlmere 
to Manchester water Aqueduct was being 
built many navvies came to Quernmore to
help to lay the pipes.As there was no  
pulic transport from Quernmore to      
Lancaster in those days a lot of their 
wages was spent in the Dog &amp; Partridge 
and the men were often drunk.This      
caused a lot of trouble in the valley. 
      Finally the local magistrates    
took away the licence from the inn and 
it became a Temperance Hotel.At the    
same time it became a Post office and  
has remained so ever since but it is   
no longer a Hotel it is just a private 
house.The Post Office has just been    
sold and the new owners are planning to
convert the barn into a house.
