		<title>16INTERVIEW WITH AN OLD PERSON</title>
		<content>   In the old days (1930's) people did 
 not have as much money as we do today.
 Mr.Drayson said that you could buy 10 
 sweets for a penny (old pence) and a  
 quarter of gobstoppers would have only
 cost about 3d.                        
   They said that their mothers bought 
 their food in the village shops and   
 hardly ever went to Dover. If they did
 go to the town it would have cost them
 6d return on the old bus (a converted 
 van driven twice a week to Dover by   
 Mr.Wellard).                          
   The houses in the village at that   
 time were far fewer and the number of 
 people in the village was about 800   
 (there are about 2000 today).         
   When asked if they preferred life   
 when they were young they both said   
 no! They enjoy living in St.Margaret's
 today.
