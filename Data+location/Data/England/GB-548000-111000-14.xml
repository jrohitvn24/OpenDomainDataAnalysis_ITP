		<title>14MY DAY</title>
		<content> In the morning I get up at 7.30 and   
 have my breakfast, which consists of a
 bowl of cereal and two pieces of toast
 with butter and jam. Then I have a    
 wash and brush my teeth. At 8.00 I put
 on my uniform, get my sandwiches and  
 kiss Mum goodbye. The school bus comes
 along at about 8.45. At school I meet 
 my friends.                           
 The school day starts with Register,  
 Assembly, A-Day mental arithmetic and 
 Scottish Maths. After play we have    
 French, then carry on with a story we 
 are writing. The afternoon starts with
 Reading and Topic work, and then we go
 swimming in our school pool.          
 At 3.30 I go home. At home I watch    
 television or play with my friends in 
 the village of Ripe where I live. I   
 have tea, perhaps liver and bacon,    
 about 7.00pm. I go to bed at 8.00 and 
 read. By about 9 o'clock I am asleep. </content>
