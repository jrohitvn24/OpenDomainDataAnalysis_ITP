		<title>02West Ashey Farm 1 (sheep)</title>
		<content>  The{sheep}at the farm are Welsh      
 ewes.These are chosen because they are
 very strong.Each ewe has two lambs.   
 When we were there, 290 sheep were    
 pregnant.Today (24th April 1985) 526  
 sheep were sent to Banbury market.The 
 lambing only lasts a few weeks, and   
 the lambs we saw were only a few days 
 old. 10% of the lambs need help to be 
 born.Dennis Burts, the farmhand, gets 
 very tired having to go out every few 
 hours to check them.He even has to    
 go out at night. The sheeps' fleeces  
 have to rise before they can be       
 sheared in June.When the sheep need to
 be dipped (in Autumn) Dennis has to   
 borrow the dip from the nearest       
 farm.Last year 1000 sheep were        
 dipped (CHAOS!).Luckily, Glen, the 4  
 year old collie, helped to sort things
 out.
