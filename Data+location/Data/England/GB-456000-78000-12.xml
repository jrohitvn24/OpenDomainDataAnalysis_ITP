		<title>12St. Blasius Church</title>
		<content> The Manor of Shanklin was mentioned in
 the first Domesday Book. There is     
 evidence of the existence of a chapel 
 in the 13th century attached to the   
 Manor. St Blasius did not become a    
 Parish Church in its own  right until 
 the middle of the last century in     
 1853.There are many interesting things
 in the church. A heavy oak chest dated
 1512, a lot of very old silver and an 
 old organ. The church holds about 250 
 people and has a bell tower with three
 bells. The grave yard is one acre with
 about 366 graves. The Lych Gate was   
 erected by Shanklin residents in 1894 
 as a memorial to Francis White Popham,
 last resident Lord Of The Manor.{
