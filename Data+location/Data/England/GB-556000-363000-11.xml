		<title>11School's 50th Anniversary</title>
		<content> On Monday 17th June our school,       
{Skegness County Junior,}celebrated its
 50th Anniversary. It was a memorable  
 day for everyone. In the morning at   
 9:00 the fourth year went into the    
 hall for a service with Rev.Adley.    
 The parents of the children were able 
 to visit the school and watch children
 taking part in activities. When it was
 9:30 the third years did gymnastics   
 in front of an audience. Shortly      
 afterwards the fourth years sang and  
 danced. Then they did some music on   
 such things as xylophones,a computer/ 
 synthesiser and percussion. After     
 dinner the second years did a play    
 about two bees while the first years  
 did art and craft in their classrooms.
 At 2:30 the first and second years had
 a disco.At 3:30 the third and fourth  
 years had a disco.So ended a fabulous 
 day which everybody enjoyed.          </content>
