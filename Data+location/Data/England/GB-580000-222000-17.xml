		<title>17THE VILLAGE SHOP,BRADWELL</title>
		<content>{*}The village shop is owned privately;
 it does not supply all the income the 
 owner needs,so he also runs a car     
 repair business.                      
{*}The shop is open from 8a.m.to 6p.m. 
 weekdays(except for Wednesday which is
 half-day closing),Saturday morning and
 Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m..The shop
 is open on most bank holidays.        
{*}Over the past four years there has  
 been a slight increase in income.There
 are about 150 customers each week.This
 may decrease in the future as more    
 young people,with their own cars, come
 to live here.The supermarkets in      
 Braintree take most of the trade.     
{*}A girl is employed on Saturday      
 mornings.There is no regular delivery 
 of goods,but the owner will deliver,if
 asked.The shop is also a Post Office, 
 and sells general groceries,drinks and
 confectionery,but no local produce.   </content>
