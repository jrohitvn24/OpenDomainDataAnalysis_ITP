 fishing village but has now developed 
 into a small high-clas residential and
 holiday resort.                       
   Now lying inland are the old        
 coastguard cottages which show how the
 sea has been pushed back over the     
 years.The remainder of West Wittering 
 village comprises of a few old        
 cottages near the church and numerous 
 attractive private estates and luxury 
 homes,some of which are holiday homes.
   Amongst the famous people who have  
 lived in the village are Eric Gill,the
 sculptor,whose father was vicar here  
 from 1914 _ 1930,and Sir Henry Royce, 
 who lived and worked here from 1917   
 until his death here in April 1933.
