		<content>    From our school we are able to     
 observe the arrival in the fields near
 the River Eden of the visiting Geese  
 which over-winter on our coast. We    
 see Barnacle Geese arrive in October  
 feeding in the fields on the north    
 bank of the River Eden.               
    In March of this year I observed   
 forty Whooper Swans on the tidal      
 section of the River Eden who stayed a
 few days. From time to time a dead    
 Swan is found on the banks of the     
 river.                                
    On a walk along the river bank in  
 May I saw a variety of birds. Sand    
 Martins who had built their nests in  
 the sandy banks and were now catching 
 flies for their young. On the river I 
 observed Goosander, Shelduck and      
 Oystercatchers', and flying overhead  
 were Swifts, Snipes and Golden        
 Plovers.                              </content>
