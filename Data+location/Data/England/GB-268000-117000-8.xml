		<content> At {Bycott Farm, Chulmleigh,          
 can be found an example of a small    
 farm machinery workshop. The farmland 
 is used for grass  and the land is    
 then rented to local farmers.         
         Along side this work the      
 farmer employs three men who make a   
 type of spraying machine which has    
 been designed by the farmer himself.  
         The firm known as{Bateman     
{Agricultural}advertises in the        
 local press, farming magazines and by 
 displaying the products at local      
 Agricultural Shows.                   
 The sprayer which is called the       
 Bateman Hilo  is powered from the cab 
 by an hydraulic boom control. The Hi  
 Lo can be fitted with a boom length   
 from 12 -24 metres. The machine has an
 all- wheel drive and four wheel       
 steering which leaves only one set of 
 tracks ,allowing easy access to crops.</content>
