		<title>11Castle Remains, Yelden</title>
		<content> The Castle provides an interesting    
 feature within the village. There is  
 some degree of uncertainty as to it's 
 date and origin. The Castle is        
 believed to have been occupied in the 
 1st Century by the Iceni, a tribe of  
 Britains from the East of England.    
 It occupies some 14 acres of land     
 alongside the River Till. The works   
 comprise a central keep or mound, 40  
 ft. high from the bottom of the moat  
 and on the north side 2 baileys. A    
 wide moat still holding water in      
 winter surrounds the south bailey.    
 There has probably been fire damage as
 there is evidence of reddened stone.  
 In 12th Century a stone castle was    
 built on the mound, it was owned by   
 the Earl of Gloucester and sub let to 
 the Trailly Family. Today public      
 footpaths near to the castle make     
 cursory inspection interesting.       </content>
