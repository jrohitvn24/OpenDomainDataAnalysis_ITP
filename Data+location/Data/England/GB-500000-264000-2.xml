		<content> Melchbourne was an important village  
 in Medieaval times, being bound up    
 with the Knights Hospitallers of the  
 order of St. John.                    
 A fair was held on the feast of St.   
 Mary Magdalen after licence was       
 granted in 1264 and Feast Sunday is   
 still  observed in the church on the  
 second Sunday in July.                
 A market was held every Friday.       
 During the Reformation the Order was  
 supressed and the lands were granted  
 to the Earl of Bedford.               
 Lord St. John of Bletsoe acquired     
 Melchbourne in 17th century and       
 transferred his seat from Bletsoe     
 Castle. The Estate remained with      
 successive Lords St. John until the   
 Second World War.                     
 Until the Estate was sold off everyone
 who lived in Melchbourne worked the   
 estate and went to Church on Sundays. </content>
