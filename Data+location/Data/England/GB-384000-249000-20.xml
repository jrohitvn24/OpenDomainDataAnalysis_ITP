		<title>20THE KEMPSEY SURVEYORS.</title>
		<content>   The survey of the Kempsey and Norton
 area was carried out in the Summer of 
 1985 by children and staff of Nunnery 
 Wood High School in Worcester.        
   The surveyors themselves would like 
 to thank all the people in the Kempsey
 and Norton area for their enormous    
 help and in particular Gillian Barnett
 and Catherine Oram of Kempsey Primary 
 School who told us about their school 
 for the survey.                       
   The pupils from Nunnery Wood were   
 all in there second year (ages 12 to  
 13) and were  Emma Scoular, Richard   
 Beale, Leon Burton, and Jason Moseley.
 Their teacher was Mr.Michael Leydon.  
   The survey itself was carried out in
 the Summer when the World's Pop Stars 
 came together in an attempt to raise  
 large amounts of money to help feed   
 the starving people in Ethiopia.
