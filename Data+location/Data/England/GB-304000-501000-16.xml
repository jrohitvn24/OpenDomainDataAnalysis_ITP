		<title>16GOSFORTH A CUMBRIAN VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of Gosforth lies in two   
 main parts; one clustered around the  
 shops in the centre of the village,   
 the other around the former Inn at    
 Wellington. Between these lie the     
 Church and the School.                
 Before the coming of the Nuclear Power
 Station in the late '40's Gosforth was
 dependent on Agriculture.It had to be 
 self-sufficient because busses ran on 
 Thursdays and Saturdays only,as these 
 were Whitehaven Market days,and cars  
 were luxuries.                        
 The new industry employed many        
 scientists,so Gosforth was developed  
 by private builders in small          
 estates.The first at the end of the   
 village is called Maedowfield. It was 
 begun in 1960 and has just had its    
 third phase of development.There are  
 now 3 estates and other houses at     
                                       </content>
