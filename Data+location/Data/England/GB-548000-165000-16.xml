		<title>16The M25 Motorway</title>
		<content>  The M25 (the outer London orbital    
 motorway)is being built on farmland to
 the west of the village .Much of the  
 land being used was owned and farmed  
 by Mr. Miller at Wested farm (see page
 10  ).This section which goes from the
 Swanley interchange to the interchange
 at the foot of Polhill,was started in 
 1984 and hopes to be completed in     
 1986.The cost of the section will be  
 high(between Â£40 and Â£50 millions) of 
 the need to build a large number of   
 bridges, underpasses,connecting       
 roads,embankments and cuttings because
 the relief of the land.The motorway   
 nearest to Crockenhill will be hidden 
 from view by raised mounds of earth   
 known as bunds.Only two people of     
 Crockenhill opposed the motorway      
 because the visual damage to the      
 village and the fear the village would
 become a suburb of outer London.      </content>
