		<title>18Redcar Folk Festival</title>
		<content> The 17th Annual Redcar Folk Festival, 
 a gathering of Folk musicians, dancers
 and people who just enjoy Folk Music, 
 took place between 12th-14th July in  
 and around the Redcar Bowl.           
                                       
 It was thought by many that the line- 
 up this year was the best for many a  
 year. Those appearing included Martin 
 Carthy and Tony Rose, Rab Noakes, Gary
 and Vera Aspey and the Kipper Family. 
 The dancers were headed by a group of 
 Irish dancers, Clan na Gael, together 
 with traditional Morris Dancing and   
 Sword Dancing.                        
                                       
 As well as the concerts, workshops and
 ceildhs many felt that the best part  
 of the weekend was the frequency of   
 informal "sing arounds" in the local  
 pubs.                                 
                                       </content>
