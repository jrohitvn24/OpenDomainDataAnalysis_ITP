		<content>  We went to Francis Baily Primary     
 School (5-11 yrs) and The Kennet      
 Secondary School (11-16 yrs) to find  
 which games children played at        
 breaktimes. We talked to children from
 5-16 yrs old and found they played    
 Football, Skipping ,Kingy, Triangle,  
 Flying Hats, Off ground he and        
 Gymnastics.We discovered that Football
 is the most popular game for all ages.
 Football is a game for two teams of   
 eleven players.The idea is to kick the
 ball into the opposing team's goal and
 is played on grass usually during the 
 winter months.The most popular game   
 with the Infants was Flying Hats,where
 you have a big square and lots of     
 little squares with numbers in them.  
 Children have to jump into the squares
 and they get the points they land on. 
 Most children of all ages seem to play
 games at playtimes.                   </content>
