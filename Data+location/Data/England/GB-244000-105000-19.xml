		<title>19LIFE ON A DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> On Forda Farm the cows are milked     
 twice daily at 7 am and 6.30 pm.      
 Milking takes two hours. The farmer's 
 wife brings in the cows while the     
 farmer prepares the parlour. Five cows
 at a time enter each side of the      
 herringbone parlour.The farmer stands 
 below in a pit to wash the udders and 
 attach the clusters. These are        
 attached to a jar connected by pipes  
 to a bulk tank. After milking, the    
 cows' teats are covered in an         
 antiseptic solution and they are let  
 out. At 9.30 the milk tanker collects 
 the milk. In addition to constant     
 maintenance of land, machinery, fences
 and buildings, there are many seasonal
 jobs. In April and June the fields are
 fertilized and in May and July silage 
 is cut. The cattle are kept in from   
 November to April and fed on silage.
