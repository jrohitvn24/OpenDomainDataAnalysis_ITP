  The biggest worry to local residents 
 is the{Industrial Estate}being built  
 near Chaddlewood.                     
  Apart from the actual buildings,which
 are to be for light industry,there are
 also{two pipe lines}which have been   
 laid across the area.                 
  One is a{gas pipe}which helps to     
 deliver gas more easily to Cornwall,  
 and the other is a{water main}which   
 connects to the resevoir at Lutton.   
 Both of these have been laid close    
 enough to the new Industrial Estate to
 be of benefit.At least the{excavations
{have been landscaped again}and the    
 Devon Hedges been replaced.           
  The other worry is the proposed      
{housing development}around Chaddlewood
 farm.Already dwellings are creeping   
 into the area eating up valuable land.
