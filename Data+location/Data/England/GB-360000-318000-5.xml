		<content> Employment opportunities in this area 
 are limited.   The traditional        
 occupation of farmer/ farm worker is  
 now limited, with very high levels of 
 mechanisation in the wealthy farms of 
 the area.   Equally young people      
 choose to move to other areas for work
 in towns and cities.                  
 A number of people in the area work   
 outside of it, notably in Wellington  
 or Telford.   These people tend to be 
 white-collar workers/management, who  
 can afford the higher prices of houses
 away from the newer Development       
 Corporation housing estates of        
 Telford, and also have private        
 transport, as public transport is     
  limited. The region of               
 East Shropshire suffers from very high
 unemployment (21% in 1984) and        
 therefore opportunities for young or  
 old are very limited.                 </content>
