 Witley Youth Centre.We go every Friday

 the jukebox.Soft drinks and food are  
 on sale during the evening.Sometimes  
 roller skate discos are arranged and  
 special dances with a theme such as   
 'Monsters',when we all dress up.In the
 summer,we go outside the centre to the
 recreation ground where we play games 
 of rounders and play on the swings and
 roundabout.We enjoy Youth Club a lot.

 our friends and go to Godalming,which
