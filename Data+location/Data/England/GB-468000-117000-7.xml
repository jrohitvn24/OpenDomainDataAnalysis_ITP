		<content> The Country Park Interpreter feels    
 that, with so many activities already 
 established in the park,it is time to 
 expand its use in other directions,   
 perhaps into music,theatre and        
 exhibitions of painting and sculpture.
 The large patio outside the Centre    
 could be used for open air productions
 and concerts.The video/lecture theatre
 could also be used.December 1985 will 
 see the second carol concert staged in
 the centre.The Interpreter wants to   
 encourage local groups and clubs to   
 use the Centre for some of their      
 meetings.He feels that,in this way,a  
 wider cross section of the community  
 would come to know and love the       
 countryside and realise the need for  
 its conservation.
