		<content> Prevailing winds from the west bring a
 high rainfall to this area which is   
 300 to 800 feet above sea level. It is
 silurian rock and limestone covered   
 with rough fell and bracken. There are
 2 natural and 1 manmade tarns, 5 becks
 and 180 miles of footpaths and        
 bridleways. There is intense          
 conservation by the main landowner,{  
{The National Trust,}and 25% of the    
 area is coniferous and deciduous      
 woodland. There are fine specimens of 
 western red cedar and yew. A small    
 marsh has many unusual grasses and    
 because atmospheric pollution is      
 minimal lichen and mosses abound and  
 fungi are plentiful. Amphibians are   
 many and varied and the mammal        
 population includes deer, fox, badger,
 rabbits, hare, weasles, squirrels and 
 now unfortunately, mink. These have   
 been released from a mink farm.       </content>
