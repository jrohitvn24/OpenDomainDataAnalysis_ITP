		<content> Pottlelake is a small group of houses 
 which is considered part of the small 
 but very sprawling hamlet of Umborne. 
 A thatched cottage, adjoining a tiled 
 cottage is a place of unusual         
 interest. It was originally a         
 carpenter's cottage, then was         
 converted into a church in late       
 Victorain times. A branch of the      
 Presbyterian Church (Yhe Irvinites    
 used the building for many years, then
 it was taken over by the Church of    
 England and used until 1981 as a      
 Chapel-at-Ease of Colyton parish. Poor
 attendances caused closure and now it 
 is used as summer-let accomodation.   
 All the stained glass windows remain  
 and with its well kept thatched roof  
 it is a very attractive building.
