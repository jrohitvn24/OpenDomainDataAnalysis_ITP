		<title>10Stockbridge Downs</title>
		<content>    Stockbridge Downs are  owned   by  
 the National  Trust. The Downs is used
 for walking dogs.It has a lot of tall 
 grass and some of it is short grass   
 for picnickers.When you walk on the   
 Downs on the hills you can see for    
 miles, you can see Leckford Golf      
 Course and if you follow Woolbury Ring
 round you come to a white horse.      
    Riding on the Downs is great fun   
 there are lots of places to gallop and
 canter.Really you are not supposed to 
 gallop on the Downs but some people   
 do.   You have to be careful of the   
 rabbit holes there because the horse  
 could break a leg.                    
    The Stockbridge Downs is used for  
 walking,kite-flying,horse-riding and  
 tobogganing in the winter by many     
 people in the area.
