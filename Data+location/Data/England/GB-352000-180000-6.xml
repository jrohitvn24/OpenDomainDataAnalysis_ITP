		<content> The  area has one village shop in     
 Hallen. This supplies most items from 
 fresh vegetables, milk and domestic   
 comestibles to wood, wines, spirits to
 daily papers. There is no delivery    
 service. The garage, as well as       
 supplying oil and petrol also sells   
 coal and paraffin. The absence of     
 other shops e.g. chemist,butcher,     
 ironmonger etc. means that people have
 to travel to buy these articles.      
 RELIGION                              
 There is one Anglican church, which   
 was built in l854, largely through the
 generosity of a local philanthropist  
 to serve as a chapel of ease for the  
 adjoining village of Henbury. The     
 church is poorly attended and  other  
 denominations worship away from Hallen
