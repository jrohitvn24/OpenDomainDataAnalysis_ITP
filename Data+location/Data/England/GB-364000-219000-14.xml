		<title>14QUAKER PLOTS</title>
		<content> About 1813 there was a small community
 of Quakers in Hoovers Lane who were   
 given about 2 acres of land on which  
 they built their bungalows and worked 
 the land as market gardens.These      
 continued as family concerns but some 
 declined as their owners retired and  
 died until today we have only one     
 true Market Gardener who has worked   
 the land since his father died and    
 retails his produce on the side of the
 road.The rest of the properties have  
 passed into the hands of private      
 buyers, most of them very local. But  
 there still remains on one of these   
 old plots a grave with a headstone.   
 They sunk wells and used the wind to  
 generate low voltage electricity. Some
 were Beekeepers and very industrious  
 in old age.The occupiers now have a   
 Mains Water supply although you can   
 see evidence of those former years.   </content>
