		<title>14Johnson's Wax, Frimley Green</title>
		<content>   This company provides much          
 employment for people in this area.   
 Founded in 1886 in Racine, Wisconsin, 
 U.S.A., Samuel Curtis Johnson bought a
 parquet flooring business and two     
 years later began to make wax pastes  
 to help people keep their floors in   
 good condition.                       
   From 1914 the business concentrated 
 on production of wax polishes,        
 discontinuing the manufacture of      
 floors. In that year Johnson's Wax    
 came to Britain.                      
   Eventually the first purpose-built  
 factory was completed in Frimley in   
 1960, on 66 acres of farmland and     
 marshland. It has been extended       
 several times. Employees are well     
 catered for at work and in leisure    
 time, and care has been taken to blend
 the factory into the surrounding area.
