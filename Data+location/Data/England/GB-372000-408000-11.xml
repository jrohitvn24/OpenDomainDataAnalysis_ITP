		<content> Tonge Moor has a large selection of   
 shops. It is very convenient for older
 people and mothers with young         
 children. Most of the shops are small 
 and busy. Many of them are food shops;
 grocers, greengrocers, confectioners  
 and butchers. There are two post      
 offices and a bank. Amongst non-food  
 shops there is a jewellers,           
 photographers, hairdressers, shoe     
 shop, pet store, florists and a few   
 news agents and off licences. Many of 
 the shops sell sweets. Children from  
 our school call in on the way to and  
 from school. The fish and chip shops, 
 pie shops,the Chinese Takeaway and    
 cafes are very busy at dinner time and
 tea time. Some of them open later as  
 well for people to call in on their   
 way home from the pub or club.
