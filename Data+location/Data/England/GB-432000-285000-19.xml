		<content> There used to be a lot of{coal-mines  
 in Bedworth.The last one was{Newdigate
{Pit}which closed in 1982.A new company
 has taken over the site for the next  
 2 yrs to get all the small,but good   
 quality coal out of the waste tip.It  
 uses a new process that washes the    
 coal out of the rubbish.The council   
 are planning to build factories on the
 old pit site if they can raise enough 
 money.{MINING FAMILIES }came to the   
 Bedworth Heath area from Somerset,    
 Wales,Scotland &amp; Tyne &amp; Wear because  
 their own pits were closing.          
  Over the past 12 yrs there has been a
 continuing increase in the number of {
{Asian families}moving to Cedars Estate
 from urban areas of Coventry.In the   
 main shopkeepers,market traders or    
 small factory owners.Extended families
 are common.Mother tongue spoken at    
 home.Well integrated community exists.</content>
