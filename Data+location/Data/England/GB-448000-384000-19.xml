 Teachers also come to our school to   
 teach violin and guitar. The lessons  
 we do are mathematics, writing,       
 reading, painting, drawing and        
 modelling. We write about the local   
 environment also about journeys and   
 educational visits to places such as  
 the coast, a city or a local farm.    
 Recently we have visited Filey,       
 Rotherham library and the Chesterfield
