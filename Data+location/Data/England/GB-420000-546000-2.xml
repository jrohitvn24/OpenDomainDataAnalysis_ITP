		<title>02A SACRISTON GIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content>    A typical day for me would be to   
 get up at 7:45 and then about 8:00 I  
 have breakfast of toast and coffee. I 
 get ready for school and at 8:20 we   
 walk up to school in the next village.
 The bell goes at 9:00 and we go to    
 Family Group. This is where all the   
 brothers and sisters go and talk about
 the things that happened last night.  
 Lessons start at 9:20. At 10:30 the   
 bell goes to tell you that it is      
 breaktime. Then at 11:55 we go to     
 dinner. At 12:35 I go to my next      
 lesson. At 3:10 the bell goes and we  
 go home. When I go home, I do my      
 homework and have my tea and watch    
 television for the rest of the        
 evening.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
