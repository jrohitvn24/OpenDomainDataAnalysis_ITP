		<content> Our survey area contains more         
 agricultural land than residential    
 land.  The residential land comes up  
 to the northern border of the city of 
 Plymouth.  It covers the Bere Ferrers 
 peninsula which you can only get to by
 going all the way up to Gunnislake or 
 taking the train.  The only square    
 with lots of houses in is the square  
 with our school in.  There are three  
 woods in the area, Warleigh Wood,     
 Whitleigh Wood, and Yappers Wood.     
 There are also two marshes in the area
 Whitleigh Marsh and Blaxton Marsh.    
 The squares are bisected by the rivers
 Tamar, Tavy and Tamerton lake, or "the
 creek" as it is known locally.  The   
 squares cover Tamerton Foliot, part of
 Whitleigh and lower Ernesettle.
