		<content>   There was a church standing in Saxon
 times. The Chaucel was re-built in the
 16th  century  and  the  rest  of  the
 church was re-built in 1900. There are
 126 steps  up to the top of the  tower
 to the bells.  The  tower  has 8 bells
 and they are loud and magnificent. The
 church's bells are known as one of the
 best  rings  in  Bedfordshire. The Rev
 P.A.Tubbs  has  been in Cardington for
 16yrs,but is leaving soon.            
   Sunday service is  attended by about
 60  people, more  at  morning service.
   The parish extends over a wider area
 than Cardington  (pop:260). The parish
 includes:Cotton End, Shortstown, Old &amp;
 New Harrowden(as far as Bunyan Centre)
 and  Fenlake  (pop:4300). The Reverend
 Tubbs   believes   it  is  a  task  of
 building  up  community  life, through
 the  worship  and  fellowship  of  the
 church.                               </content>
