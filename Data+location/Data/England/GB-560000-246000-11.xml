 in the village.(there were three) .   
 LANDLORD INTERVIEW                    
  "We can't look to local trade for our
 custom. Not many of the villagers are 
 regular pub goers.We get tourists as  
 customers-English, European and even  
 Australian. We are in full view of    
 traffic on the bypass for lunchtime   
 custom.Evenings are much quieter, so  
 we rely on local and Haverhill cust-  
 omers. Disco nights they come         
 from a radius of 20 miles.15years ago 
 this was a transport cafe, and was run
 in conjunction with a garage next     
 door. It then became the De Montford  
 Arms, but when bought by the previous 
 landlord was renamed the Welcome In.  
 Although it looks modern,some of the  
 interior features reflect its 18th    
 Century origins. Some of the land was 
 bought from the "Cornish" family.     </content>
