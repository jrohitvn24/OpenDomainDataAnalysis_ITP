 B4371,in the north of the section,    
 there is a{bus to Church Stretton}on  
 school mornings only. On Thursdays    
 there is a bus for shopping,also to   
 Church Stretton. On Tuesdays and      
 Saturdays one can reach Shrewsbury,the
 nearest town,nineteen miles away.These
 buses are run by the local family firm
 of Boultons, based in the nearby      
 village of Cardington.They also run a 
 number of day trips to places of      
 interest throughout the year.These are
 well patronised.                      
 In the south of the area the Ludlow-  
 Bridgnorth{bus,}run by the Midland Red
 Bus Company,passes daily along the    
 B4368,one bus each day.
