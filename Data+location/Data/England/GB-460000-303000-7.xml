		<title>07Home Life in East Leicester.</title>
		<content> A typical Leicester boy might describe
 his weekend like this: "On Saturday I 
 dress in jeans,T-shirt &amp; jumper. I    
 have toast for breakfast &amp; go to play 
 with my friends on my bike. For lunch 
 I might have egg,bacon &amp; mushrooms.   
 Later I visit town,listen to records &amp;
 in the evening watch T.V. On Sunday I 
 wear smarter clothes. We have a roast 
 dinner. In the afternoon I may visit  
 relatives or go to church."           
 On Saturday Davinder gets up at 6 o'  
 clock,bathes &amp; prays for a quarter of 
 an hour. "I help mum with the meal of 
 chapati made with potato,butter,salt &amp;
 mint. From 12 to 3 o'clock I go to    
 Punjabi school where we learn to read 
 &amp; write Punjabi. After tea I go to    
 play at my cousin's house. Supper is  
 at 8 o'clock,we might have chapati &amp;  
 vegetables. Before bed I go to the    
 holy room to pray."                   </content>
