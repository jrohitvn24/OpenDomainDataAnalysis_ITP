		<content>  We  have  two classrooms and a dinner
 room. As well as  for  dinners  we use
 the  dinner  room  for cooking, 'Music
 and Movement' and violin lessons.     
  Our playground is very small so we go
 to  the  Recreation  Field  (rec.)  on
 Tuesday  afternoons for games. A coach
 takes  us  up  because  the road is so
 dangerous. On Thursday afternoon we go
 in a coach to Frome  sports centre for
 swimming.                             
  We  go  on  trips  sometimes  for our
 Environmental  work. We  did a project
 on  the church and put on an exhibtion
 of our work in the church.            
  We  have a computer and a disc drive,
 headphones and a tape recorder so that
 we  can  listen  to  stories,  a jumbo
 typewriter  so  that  we can write our
 own stories. A colour T.V. and a radio
 cassette player. All these things were
 bought by the Parent Teachers Assoc'n.</content>
