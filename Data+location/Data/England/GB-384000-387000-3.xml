		<title>03SHOPPING AT GATLEY, CHEADLE.</title>
		<content>   WE CARRIED OUT OUR OWN SHOPPING     
 SURVEY IN GATLEY AND FOUND MORE PEOPLE
 VISITED THE SUPERMARKETS THAN ANY     
 OTHER SHOPS.GATEWAY, WHICH IS OPPOSITE
 THE PUB THE PRINCE OF WALES, HAS MORE 
 CUSTOMERS IN THE MORNING THAN THE     
 AFTERNOON AND IS ABOUT TWICE AS BUSY  
 AS THE CO-OP. VERY FEW PEOPLE VISIT   
 SHOPS SUCH AS THE FIREPLACE CENTRE    
 BECAUSE PEOPLE ONLY NEED ONE          
 FIREPLACE, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO  
 THE FOOD SHOPS EVERY DAY. THE PEOPLE  
 WHO DO NOT ALWAYS SHOP IN GATLEY      
 EITHER GO TO STOCKPORT AR WILMSLOW AND
 A VERY FEW GO TO MANCHESTER. NEARLY   
 ALL PEOPLE WALK TO GATLEY AND THINK   
 GATLEY SHOPPING CENTRE IS VERY        
 CONVENIENT. THEY LIKE MEETING THEIR   
 FRIENDS AND THINK THE SHOP KEEPERS ARE
 VERY FRIENDLY.
