		<content> At{Oakhurst}farm it was mostly Dairy. 
 The 90 cows are milked in the morning 
 and evening. In the milking parlour   
 each cow has its own cubicle with hay 
 and cow-salt. The farmer milks 8 cows 
 at a time. A Unigate lorry comes to   
 collect the milk. A pipe is stuck in  
 the side of the wall and the milk     
 pumped into the lorry. The cows know  
 roughly when milking time is and they 
 line up by the electric fence.        
                                       
{Lords}farm has 48 acres and on most of
 the land the farm grows barley and    
 potatoes. He has only 4 fields. The   
 greenhouses have cucumbers, tomatoes  
 and pepper plants which are kept in a 
 high temperature. He sells his produce
 to local shops.
