		<title>12BRIDLE PATHS NEAR MALBOROUGH</title>
		<content>{The Thurlestone Ridge Path            
 Our best bridle path is the ridge     
 which runs from{Thurlestone}to{South  
{Milton}and to{South Huish}.We have a  
 great game down the path .It is       
 usually me, Sarah, on Zaida my pony   
 who stays behind , and Jenny on her   
 pony Dodger goes and hides in a gate  
 way . I come charging up the hill and 
 Jenny jumps out and gallops after me  
 going,{"Wo!Wo!Wo!",}and {"Aaaaaaaa!   
{Aaaaaaa!"}, until we get to the end of
 the lane .{                           
{The Hope Cove Ridge Path}             
 Jenny and I also like this path. It   
 starts at{Hope Cove }and ends at {    
{Galmpton}. At the start you have to go
 very carefully because there is a     
 cliff. When we get on the lane and    
 start cantering , we break into a     
 gallop and pretend to hunt.It's great 
 fun.                                  </content>
