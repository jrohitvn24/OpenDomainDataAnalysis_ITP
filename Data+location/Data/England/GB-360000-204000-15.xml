		<content> Pillowell in the Forest of Dean has   
 been the centre of the Methodist      
 movement for 161 yrs.The present      
 Chapel was opened in 1885.            
 on Sat: 18th May 1985 the centenary   
 was celebrated.Craig Ward reports:_   
 The Sunday School children and        
 villagers dressed in period costume   
 and led by the village band,walked    
 from the old Chapel to the "new       
 building" Just as their fore_ fathers 
 had done.Many of the costumes were    
 originals.On arrival back at the      
 Chapel,3 of the oldest members opened 
 the doors and a service of            
 rememberance was held.Inside the      
 Chapel was a historical exhibition of 
 old records and photographs,including 
 2 vases given to the builders 100yrs  
 ago.
