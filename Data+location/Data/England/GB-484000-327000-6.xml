		<content> Leicestershire is traditionally a fox 
 hunting county. This area is no       
 exception being within the territory  
 of the Belvoir Hunt. Many of the small
 areas of trees have been retained as  
 cover for foxes.The fox hunting season
 starts in September and finishes in   
 March.                                
 Pheasant and partridge shooting is    
 also traditional and common in the    
 area. The shooting is not as good as  
 in some of the surrounding areas since
 it is relatively flat. Whereas in     
 hilly areas the woodland cover would  
 be on high ground allowing the birds  
 to be driven over the guns in the     
 valleys, in this area the guns and    
 cover are at at similar level and the 
 birds have to be artificially made to 
 fly higher, for example by being      
 driven over stands of coniferous      
 trees.                                </content>
