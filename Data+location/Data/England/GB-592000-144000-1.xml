 villages, Pluckley and Little Chart   
 with their combined population of just

 lies to north-west of Ashford. The    
 main road through the village is the  
 B2O77 which runs from the A20 London  
 to Dover road at Charing to the       
 village of Smarden. Pluckley is built 
 on the greensand ridge with panoramic 
 views across the Weald. The           
 countryside is farmland given to      
 crops,grazing and orchards with a few 
 light industries. The village centres 
 around The Street in which stands the 
 church, the local school and the

 a reputation for being the most       
 haunted village in Kent.
