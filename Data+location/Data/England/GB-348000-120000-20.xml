		<content>  An interview with  the local M.P.    
  On saturday afternoon I interviewed  
 Mr.Paddy Ashdown and asked him if he  
 thought Westland would have to close  
 due to their present crisis.He thought
 not as the Government has promised new
 orders and he hopes the firm will     
 expand and more small businesses will 
 start.He says the town must be careful
 to preserve old buildings to encourage
 visitors and investment.There are     
 11,000 council houses around          
 Yeovil,many of which have been sold,  
 which is good for the country but not 
 for Yeovil.                           
  Mr.Ashdown is a Liberal and won the  
 Yeovil seat in the last election after
 many years of Conservative            
 representation.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
