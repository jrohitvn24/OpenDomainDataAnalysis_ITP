		<content> Some residents of Suncroft,Dipton     
 have been complaining about a noise   
 coming from Dean Dove's factory at    
 Harlaw Industrial Estate.They         
 said the noise was like a big fridge. 
 The noise kept her from getting to    
 sleep at night.Their house is 500m.   
 across the road from the factory.The  
 noise has been going on for ten years 
 and they have been complaining        
 about the noise for 2 years.The       
 factory produces man made polyester   
 thread,which is very strong.The noise 
 is not made all the time because the  
 factory closes down frequently.The    
 factory has to do something to        
 reduce the noise within 3 months or   
 they will be taken to court and fined.
