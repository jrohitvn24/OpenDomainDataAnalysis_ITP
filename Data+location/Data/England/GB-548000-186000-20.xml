		<title>20A SHOPPING SURVEY</title>
		<content>  The shopping area near Robert Clack  
 School is on Whalebone Lane.It has    
 a supermarket,D.I.Y. stores,a bread   
 shop,newsagents and a health studio.  
 When pupils from the school surveyed  
 shoppers they found that most local   
 people shopped here more than once a  
 week.This is because it is convenient,
 the shops are close together,there are
 zebra crossings and there is a car    
 park behind the supermarket.          
  Romford is the large market town     
 where people do their main shopping   
 (clothes and furniture).There is a    
 good variety of shops,a pedestrian    
 walkway,and ample parking spaces.Many 
 shoppers use public transport.        
  People in this area rarely shop in   
 London.Over half our pupils said they 
 went just 3 to 5 times a year.Many    
 went less often than this.
