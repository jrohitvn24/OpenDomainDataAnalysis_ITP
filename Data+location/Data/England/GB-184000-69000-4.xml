		<content> In our area the amount of overhead    
 wires is about 4000m in length. The   
 materials used for overhead wires is  
 copper and for the underground wires  
 the materials are copper and aluminium
 but it is mainly aluminium. In our    
 area the materials used are a bit     
 different than those used in big      
 cities. It is called the coastal      
 strip, the wire is made out of copper 
 and aluminium but mainly copper. The  
 electricity consumption in winter is a
 lot higher than in summer. An average 
 consumption of a typical farm in a    
 year is higher than an average        
 consumption of a typical household.   
 The places in our area which use most 
 electricity are the farms and holiday 
 attractions. There are not any pylons 
 in our area.
