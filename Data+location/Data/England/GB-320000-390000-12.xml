		<content>{The"PARRY"Family.}A Typical Saturday. 
 There are 5 people in our household,  
 Mum,Dad,two brothers aged 9 and 6     
 years,and myself aged 10 years. We all
 wake up at about 7.30am to 8.00am and 
 get up and get dressed at about 8.30am
 and have breakfast.My Dad has to go to
 work on alternate Saturdays as he is a
 doctor.He leaves home at about 8.45am 
 to get to work at West Kirby Concourse
 which is about 3 miles away.His day   
 consists of seeing patients in surgery
 and visiting them at home.He usually  
 finishes at about midday.             
 I clean out my hamster,she is nearly  
 2 years old and very tame. Her name is
 Quiver.Mum does the washing so we have
 clean clothes for school on Monday.On 
 Saturdays my 9 year old brother goes  
 to gymnastics at West Kirby Concourse 
 from 11.00am to 1.30pm so we take him 
 down by car.                          </content>
