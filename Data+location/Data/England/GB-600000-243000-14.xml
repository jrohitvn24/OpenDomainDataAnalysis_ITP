		<content>  Tesco's is the largest store in      
Hadleigh and everybody goes there.It   
sells:clothes,shoes,electrical goods,  
furniture,D.I.Y.equipment,toys,        
toiletries,kitchen products,crisps,    
sweets and drink.It is called a        
"Home n'wear" store.                   
  It is built like a big barn or       
warehouse and is warm inside,with the  
lights always on.There are about six   
checkouts where you pay for your goods 
which you collect in a large trolley.  
  The entrance has a big porch over it 
and there are toys for children to have
rides on.Outside there is a very large 
car park and garden centre.            
  When Tesco's first opened, other     
shopkeepers in Hadleigh were very      
worried that they would loose trade.The
store attracts so many people to       
Hadleigh,we think the other shops do   
quite well,so they are happy now.      </content>
