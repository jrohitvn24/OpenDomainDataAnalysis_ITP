		<title>07GOLDTHORPE LIBRARY.</title>
		<content> Goldthorpe Library is well situated,  
 it is in the middle of Goldthorpe.    
 The Library was built in 1968 and was 
 opened in the same year.              
 The Library is well used and they have
 about{26,000 books.} The service has  
 been extended as they now lend        
 cassettes and they have got about 20  
 records, which they also lend out.    
 There are four staff in the Library   
 and they collect about{Â£25.00 a week} 
 in fines.                             
 There are three floors on the         
 building, they are set out well but it
 does{not cater for the disabled.  }   
 The ventilation is bad in the         
 manager's office as there is only one 
 window and that only opens six inches 
 before it hits the adjoining wall.    
 In my opinion it provides an adequate 
 service but the building could have   
 been designed better.                 </content>
