		<title>07TRACY IN ALBRIGHTON.</title>
		<content>      When I went on the visit to the {
{Albrighton }area I saw it was mainly  
 farmland.It is gently undulating and  
 sloping to the southwest with some    
 patches of mixed woodland to the      
 northwest.The{A528.}goes through      
{Albrighton,}it is very busy with      
 traffic going from{Shrewsbury }to {   
{Ellesmere.                            
{    }The village consists of 6        
 houses,3 farms,{Albrighton Hall }and  
 the chapel.The chapel has a weather   
 cock on top and stone faces on the    
 corners,it is built from reddy brown  
 sandstone.                            
     {Albrighton Hall }is very stately 
 indeed, perhaps lords and ladies lived
 there in the past.It has very tall    
 double chimneys sitting on the roof.  
 The hall farm is right on the main    
 road with many barns and buildings.
