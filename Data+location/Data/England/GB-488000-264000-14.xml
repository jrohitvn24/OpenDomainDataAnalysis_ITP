The village of Great Doddington has    
many organisations catering for old    
and young alike. The children can go to
cubs, scouts, girls brigade and there  
is a Sunday School at the chapel and   
the church. There are two Women's      
Institutes one meeting in the afternoon
and one in the evening. A Whist Club   
meets once a month and there is a      
Friendship Club for the elderly which  
meets every Friday. There are classes  
for keep fit, local history and cake   
decorating. The Friends of Great       
Doddington Primary School hold social  
evenings for parents and friends. They 
also have discos, beetle drives and    
film shows for the children at the     
school. The Stag's Head public house   
has a darts team and other games are   
also played there.
