		<content> The village is surrounded by farms    
 many of which concentrate on pig      
 breeding In the nearby village of     
 Britwell Salome a farmer initiated a  
 method of breeding pigs in open fields
 rather than in enclosed sties. The    
 fields are dotted with corrugated iron
 roofed huts, each large enough to     
 house a sow and her litter. The pigs  
 take some fpod from the field but this
 is supplemented by food and water     
 brought by the farmer. A more modern  
 version of the huts is made of fibre  
 glass moulded to shape. Because of    
 their shape and colour they resemble  
 igloos and are colloquially named     
 'pigloos'.
