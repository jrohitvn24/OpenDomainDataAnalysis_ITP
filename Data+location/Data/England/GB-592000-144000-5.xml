		<content> Surrenden Ceramics is a small two man 
 business specializing in enamel       
 overglazing onto ceramic surfaces.    
 Mr.Head and Mr. Chell are at present  
 designing tiles to be used in London  
 Underground stations.                 
  They have completed work for         
 Leicester Square, Caledonian Road and 
 Baker Street stations. The design they
 chose for Baker Street were           
 silhouettes of Sherlock Holmes.  The  
 stations they are working on are Green
 Park, where they are printing a white 
 trellis pattern on a green background 
 and also Goodge Street which uses the 
 Post Office Tower in its design. Tiles
 are chosen for the stations because   
 they are virtually vandal proof and   
 are easy to keep clean.
