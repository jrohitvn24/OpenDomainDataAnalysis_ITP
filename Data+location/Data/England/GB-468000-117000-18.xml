		<title>18HOUSING IN CLANFIELD</title>
		<content> The area is sparsely populated with a 
 few scattered houses and cottages     
 including some former farm houses. The
 only exception is in the extreme south
 of the area into which Clanfield has  
 expanded.Here there is some new       
 development on the site of Ivy House  
 Farm,consisting of sheltered          
 accomodation for retired people,called
 The Swallows.It is an owner_occupied  
 complex of which 37 of the 53 planned 
 units have been completed.The original
 farm house,Orchard House,has been     
 converted into 4 flats,whilst the new 
 development consists of 33 units plus 
 a communal lounge and laundry room.   
 There is a resident warden in         
 attendance.Each flat is designed to be
 fully independant,giving residents    
 complete privacy but also facilities  
 to socialise should they so desire.
