		<title>11 Mousehold Heath</title>
		<content>  Mousehold Heath used to be 22 miles  
 in circumference and stretched as far 
 as Wroxham and Ranworth.Since the     
 times when the first Domesday book    
 was written Mousehold was owned       
 by the church.                        
   Mousehold was waste land for a long 
 time but in the 1700's many people    
 wanted to enclose the land. A lot of  
 Mousehold was taken by rich people to 
 have as their own. An act of          
 Parliament was passed so that people  
 could not own parts of Mousehold.     
   A ruin of a chapel has been found on
 Mousehold. This was built on the site 
 of the grave of a 12 year old boy. His
 name was William. His bones looked as 
 though he was crucified. The people of
 that time blamed the Jews since he had
 been seen going into a Jewish house.  
 He was probably murdered by a         
 relative. He was later made a saint   </content>
