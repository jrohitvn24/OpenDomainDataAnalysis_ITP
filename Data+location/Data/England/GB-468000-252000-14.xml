In 1981 it was realised by certain     
members of the village that something  
had to be done about the village hall. 
It was in desperate need of            
modernisation. The village hall is     
usually the heart of a community       
where people can meet and socialise but
as Gayton village hall was in such poor
repair village people were joining     
groups and using halls in neighbouring 
villages.                              
Now in 1985, after much fundraising,   
the hall has been re-opened, fully     
modernised and being used by many      
village groups such as                 
The Allotment Society  Tabletennis Club
Womens Institute       Evergreen Club  
Cricket Club           and many others.
 As one villager said, "At last        
we have a hall to be proud of, let's   
make sure we use it to the full."      </content>
