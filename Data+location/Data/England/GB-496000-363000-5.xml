		<title>05WADDINGTON COUNCIL PLANS</title>
		<content>  The Parish Council is running a      
 summer playscheme for 4 weeks during  
 August for children aged 5_11 years.  
 About 100 children a day attend.      
  The Council's  main concern at       
 present is to keep the village        
 viable, with a balanced population of 
 all ages.It considers there are enough
 old peoples council dwellings in the  
 village and has been pressing for     
 development to attract younger people.
 In this it has been successful with a 
 small estate in Blacks Close,and a    
 further bungalow development now in   
 the planning stage at Sycamore Farm.  
   A new village appraisal is being    
 prepared with the District Council.   
   The Council owns 21 acres of playing
 fields but this is administered by the
 Waddington Playing Fields Association 
 with financial backing from the       
 Council.                              </content>
