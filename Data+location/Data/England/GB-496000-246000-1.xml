		<content> This area is located centally on a    
 prominent ridge of boulder clay which 
 runs north- south along the county    
 boundary.The landscape is a series of 
 ridges and valleys drained by brooks  
 which flow eastwards and are          
 tributaries of the R.Ouse.            
 The area is entirely                  
 agricultural-intensive arable farming,
 which gives open views of the         
 surrounding countryside and across the
 fields to the Bedford-Kempston urban  
 area.There is no major concentration  
 of popultion-just the south-western   
 end of Stagsden High Street,the       
 remaining population living in about  
 12 farms.The A 422 crosses the        
 northern part and through Stagsden for
 which a By-Pass is proposed,inevitably
 meaning loss of agricultural land.
