		<title>19LIFE ON A FARM</title>
		<content>{                                      
 Every morning I get up with my daddy  
 at 6.30, I have a cup of tea, then go 
 outside to{prepare the unit}for the   
 cows to be milked. While dad is       
 milking, I feed the{bull and cows,}as 
 well as my{sheep and lamb.}Then I go  
 and help my mummy, she waters  her    
{hens}while I feed them and collect the
{eggs.}Then I go up to Winston to see  
 the cows. When I return home I have my
{breakfast}and wait for the taxi to    
 take me to school. It is a two mile   
 journey, but there is no bus service  
 to our farm, so I go by{taxi.         
 When I arrive home after{school}I     
 change. I then water the calves, and  
 feed the bull and cows. After I have  
 completed all my jobs I have my{tea.  
 Before my day is complete I round up  
 the cows for{milking.}I then relax in 
 the evening by watching{television.   </content>
