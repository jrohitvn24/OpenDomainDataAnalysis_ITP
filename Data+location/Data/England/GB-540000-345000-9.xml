		<content> Traditionally this is a farming       
 village with many of the population   
 working on farms or in farming related
 occupations.We have a village shop,a  
 garage and a builder who also employ  
 local people.The village shop,Main    
 Road Stores,sells a variety of goods  
 that village people need.It sells     
 food,drink(both alcoholic and         
 non-alcoholic),magazines and has a    
 library of films on video for people  
 to borrow at a nominal fee.The shop   
 also serves a passing trade of        
 motorists who stop for sweets and     
 ice-cream,newspapers,tobacco etc on   
 their way through the village.It opens
 at 6.30 in the morning for the        
 lorry-drivers and closes at 9.30 in   
 the evening seven days a week.It is a 
 family business and also runs a       
 delivery service for those who cannot 
 get to the shop.                      </content>
