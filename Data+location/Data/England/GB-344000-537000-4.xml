		<content> People living in rural areas such as  
 these are conscious of their distance 
 from service headquarters, such as in 
 case of emergency.                    
                                       
 The nearest Fire, Ambulance and Police
 centres are at Penrith, some 8km away.
 Although staff of these services do   
 very well in emergencies, winter      
 conditions can from time to time make 
 rural isolation total.                
                                       
 Our area is well served by the North  
 West Electricity Board, and Water     
 Board, most (but not all) homes being 
 connected to both services.           
                                       
 Refuse is collected weekly by Eden    
 District Council, and the local Parish
 Council provides for such services as 
 street lighting where considered      
 necessary.                            </content>
