 Principal-Mr.Alex Behrendt            
 A fish farm and angling complex first 
 opened in 1948. For the last 20 years,
 environmental courses for university  
 students throughout the world have    
 been held here, in a complex which    
 comprises 14 acres of lakes within a  
 total of 33 acres. Students from the  
 nearby Hampshire College of           
 Agriculture use the facilities as part
 of a course on gamekeeping.

 Purchased by the late Sir Harold      
 Hillier in 1953 and handed over to    
 Hampshire County Council in 1977 as   
 part of a charitable trust involving  
 Hillier Arboretum, the property is at 
 the moment being converted into flats 
 for use by overseas students coming to
 this country to study arboreculture.
