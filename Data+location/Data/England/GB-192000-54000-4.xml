		<title>04Conservation - Clay Area</title>
		<content> Until recently the huge white clay    
 tips would remain barren  for many    
 years before any vegetation would     
 grow. The clay industry has now       
 developed new{seeding techniques}which
 allow the white heaps to be greened in
 two or three seasons.                 
 The tips are contoured by bulldozer   
 into a more natural shape and a       
 mixture of grass seed and clovers is  
 sown.{Soay sheep}from the Western     
 Isles and cross breeds are used to    
 graze the new growth. This improves   
 the vegetation further.               
 Mica is now deposited in lagoons which
 ultimately can be covered with        
 topsoil. This avoids the{pollution}of 
 rivers and sea which occurred         
 previously.
