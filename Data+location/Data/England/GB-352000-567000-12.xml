		<content> My name is Samantha Knapton.          
 At home I usually play with           
 my dolls.Most of the dolls have       
 clothes that have been bought.I have  
 a Twirly curls Barbie which I call    
 Rachel and a Crystal Ken which I call 
 Christopher and a Sindy which I call  
 Sandra. I've a Dutch doll (which my   
 dad brought back from Holland) which I
 call Phill and I've got a sailor doll 
 which I call Teena.I have two fashion 
 dolls call Hazel and Jennifer and a   
 lot of other dolls.My Barbie is my    
 favourite doll.She has a twirly-curler
 and a purple-chair.I sometimes play   
 outside but that is when it is not    
 raining.I watch television often and I
 watch a lot.When I come home from     
 school at 3.50 I watch ITV until 4.20 
 when I watch B.B.C 1.
