		<title>04ECOLOGY AND THE FARMER</title>
		<content> The farmer of today lives and works in
 an environment whereby he not only has
 to produce crops but, also, due to    
 increasing concern over the           
 countryside, think and plan his farm  
 to accommodate the different aspects  
 of wildlife for{conservation.}Two     
 decades ago hedges, trees and dykes   
 were removed, wholesale in some areas,
 to enlarge field size for optimum     
 workability. Now we have to replace   
 hedges or create habitat such as      
 spinnies and copses. This all takes up
 valuable land but, on every farm,     
 there are places where this can be    
 done. On my own farm we have planted  
 about 800 trees over 3 years and      
 allowed hedges to grow up to about 2.2
 metres high and 1.5 metres wide giving
 an ideal habitat for a multitude of   
 wildlife.                             
                                       </content>
