		<title>09THE MANOR OF COCKAYNE HATLEY</title>
		<content>     This estate, now owned by the     
 Co-operative Wholesale Society,       
 evolved from the old manor of Cockayne
 Hatley which, until 1745, was owned by
 the Cockaynes. It was once an enormous
 apple orchard whose fame was noted in 
 a French poem where it was described  
 as the mythical "Land of Cockayne".   
     Now a commercial enterprise, the  
 1460 acres raises wheat, spring winter
 and durum (for pasta making) as well  
 as oilseed rape (for making margarine 
 and cattle feed)and, in 1985, vining  
 peas for seed purposes. THe entire    
 estate is run by only seven men       
 including the estate manager since it 
 is very well equipped with machinery.
