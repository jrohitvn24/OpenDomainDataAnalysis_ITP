		<title>12THE CIVIC CENTRE</title>
		<content> The building is{8 years old}on the    
{11th November 1985.}The{Duke of       
{Norfolk}opened it. There are 4 main   
 offices in the building, 33 people per
 office. The Civic Centre is like a    
 jungle because everywhere you walk    
 there are plants - in the basement, in
 the large hall, up stairs and in the  
 big office. The offices are 250 sq.yds
 There are an awful lot of jobs. The   
 car park can hold up to 300-350 cars. 
 488 people are employed but only 130  
 work in the actual building. The      
 people work for 39 hours a week, for 5
 days a week. They get over 1000       
 letters a week. They now use a lot of 
 computers and they are buying more and
 more each year. They are really       
 changing the way they work. The Civic 
 Centre is on a hill to keep it safe   
 from floods and so that people whose  
 homes are flooded can stay there.     </content>
