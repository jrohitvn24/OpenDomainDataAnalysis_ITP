		<content> Using patrol vehicles and now a bike, 
 the police find no real problems in   
 this area.It is a peaceful community. 
 The constable on the bike stops and   
 talks to the villagers and usually    
 ends up with a bundle of rhubarb! Two 
 problems are the parking outside the  
 pub,the Black Horse,and speeding      
 through Woodmancote on the A4135.The  
 sheer volume of the traffic and the   
 number of junctions add to the danger 
 of accidents.Visits are made to the   
 Golf Course to check for vandalism and
 visits are made to people's homes for 
 enquiries.One officer visits the local
 school to give courses on road safety 
 and at primary schools there are      
 cycling proficiency courses including 
 a test.There is also an advanced      
 course to follow it up.
