		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY, PURTON STOKE.</title>
		<content> In {Prehistory Times}the area around  
 Purton Stoke and to the west was      
 covered by large dense forests of     
 damp oak wood with thick brambly      
 undergrowth and marshes at the lower  
 levels. A track which crosses the .   
 River key by means of the slab stone  
 bridge, was part of an ancient white  
 way in use for transporting salt from 
 the north to Avebury and Stonehenge.  
 By the end of the{6c}the{Saxons}had   
 colonised this area and settled in    
 farming communities.Purton Stoke,     
 Bentham, and Hayes Knoll were part    
 of the territory called the Hundred   
 of Staple in the Kingdom of Wessex.   
 One of the routes to Malmesbury       
 in {Danish times}was via Purton       
 Stoke Bridge through the forest.      
 We could find no mention of Purton    
 Stoke in the Domesday translation.
