		<title>16TOURISM IN BURNHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>    As with other parts of Norfolk,    
 many people choose to have {holiday   
{homes}in Burnham Market. There are    
 twelve holiday homes in the survey    
 area, and these are occupied during   
 the summer months only. Other tourists
 stay in the The Poplars{caravan park}.
 This occupies three acres and has 100 
 permanent caravans, all with mains    
 services (electricity, water and      
 sewage). All the caravans are         
 privately owned and the site is only  
 open during the summer months. There  
 is space for touring caravans.        
    Close to the caravan park is a     
 redundant railway engine shed which   
 houses a collection of{fairground     
{organs}and{traction engines}. These   
 are taken to local fetes and carnivals
 where they are popular attractions.
