{Stanley Chapel}and the newest part is 
 the {Bapistry}which was built between 
 the 17th and 18th century.            
    The church steeple is about 35     
 metres high. It is called a {Brooch   
{Steeple}because it is mounted on top  
 of a tower.                           
    The{Belfry}has 6 bells; they were  
 originally cast in the 18th century.

 and the bottom half is said to be a   
 Roman Pillar.A brass jug in the       
 bapistry is filled with water and     
 blessed by the vicar.It is then poured
