 The{Weir Wood Reservoir}is owned and  
 managed by the {Southern Water        
{Authority.}It was built in the early  
 1950's and its main purpose is to     
 supply water to the population of the 
 surrounding towns.However, the        
 reservoir is now utilised in many     
 different ways. The {Weir Wood Sailing
{Club}caters for 420 enthusiastic      
 members and race meetings are held    
 most weekends. The shallow western end
 of the reservoir is prohibited to both
 sailors and anglers and provides a    
 natural and unspoiled sanctuary of {80
{acres}for wildlife, especially        
 waterfowl.{Angling}is also permitted  
 and the trout fishing season extends  
 from{April 1}to{September 30}each     
 year.However, permits are needed and  
 their issue is controlled by the      
 Southern Water Authority.             </content>
