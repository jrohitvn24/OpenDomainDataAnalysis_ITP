		<content> We have two Brownie Packs in Hutton   
 Rudby. Mrs.Truscott runs one and      
 Mrs.Baker runs the other. This summer 
 we have been doing a play. We came    
 second in the Brownie revels. Guides  
 are held on Fridays. It started       
 in 1910 by Lady Baden Powell. The     
 guides go to camp and also do a       
 concert every year, for the old       
 people. Cubs are run by Mr.Isles and  
 Mr.Fortune. The ages are from 8yrs. to
 11yrs. They meet weekly in Church     
 House. The Cubs work hard for badges, 
 probably the hardest one is the Gold  
 Arrow which only 3 or 4 boys have got.
 Scouts meet once a week too in the    
 same building. There used to be 50 in 
 the pack but now they have split up   
 into 2 groups, one in Hutton and one  
 in Swainby. Mr.Rainer and Mr.Parker   
 are the leaders.
