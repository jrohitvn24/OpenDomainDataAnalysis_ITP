		<title>03ROMFORD MARKET</title>
		<content>   The market is held on Wednesday,    
 Friday, and Saturday.It is like one   
 large shop but with separate open-air 
 stalls.Most stalls sell food,fruit,   
 vegetables and cloth.Other stalls sell
 household items and clothes.People    
 like the market because goods are     
 cheaper than at other places.There are
 real bargains and people haggle over  
 the prices.There are well over 1OO    
 stalls on market days.Also there are 2
 other markets:a covered market and an 
 antiques market.The most busy time of 
 year is Christmas,when everybody      
 comes to Romford to buy presents.They 
 come from many parts of south-east    
 England,mainly by special coach,car,  
 bus and train.People who live near    
 Romford usually prefer to walk.
