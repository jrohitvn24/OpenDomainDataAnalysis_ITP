		<content> 9am Sunday I was woken by my cat Lucky
 jumping on my bed. I dressed in my    
 black and yellow tracksuit and black  
 shoes. I had a slice of bread spread  
 with peanut butter for breakfast.     
 After breakfast I mended the puncture 
 on my bike and went to the BMX ramp at
 the Co_op park. There was a big hole  
 in it so I went home. At 10.30am I    
 cycled to church where I am a         
 chorister. The priest was ordained by 
 the Bishop of Colchester. He received 
 a bible and a stole. At 12.30pm it was
 finished. I went home for dinner, pork
 broad beans, Yorkshire pudding and new
 potatoes. I played baseball with my   
 friends and a Spanish girl. For tea I 
 had toasted baked bean sandwiches.    
 Church again at 6.30pm. and home for a
 cup of hot chocolate and bed at       
 8.30pm.
