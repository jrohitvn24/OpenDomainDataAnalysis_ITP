		<content> This area has a very mixed landcover  
 ranging from mixed farming to dense   
 forest, mainly coniferous but with a  
 smattering of varied disiduous trees. 
  The SE point is wide and undulating  
 farmland, and NE it consists mostly of
 grassland.   In the central position  
 of the area stand logerait a small    
 community with a centre for old       
 people, a hostel, carpenter, chalet   
 park and cemetary.  It is surrounded  
 by farmland and is notorious locally  
 for its beech hedgehogs, very         
 beautiful.   In Ballinhuig there is a 
 post office, car rpair garages and    
 filling station, a grill and          
 restaurant and also a public playing  
 field.   A main railway line runs     
 through the area.   There is also a   
 primary school.  The main A9 road     
 Perth to Inverness runs through this  
 most beautiful countryside.           </content>
