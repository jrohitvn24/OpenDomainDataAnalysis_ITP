		<title>01Farmland South of Adderley</title>
		<content> This is an unspectacular area of North
 Shropshire ranging between 203 &amp; 340ft
 above sea level, pock marked with     
 small ponds and with the river Duckow 
 meandering thro' its western part.    
 There are about a dozen small farms,  
 mostly engaged in mixed farming and   
 employing much of the sparse          
 population.  A main road, the A529,   
 crosses the block almost north to     
 south and along this, on Wednesdays   
 only, run two bus routes.   In        
 addition to this road less than 14 ft 
 wide neither level nor straight, and  
 two public footpaths.   The Shropshire
 Union Canal runs north south through  
 the three eastern squares of the block
 with no public bridges crossing it.   
 The canal is used exclusively and     
 fairly heavily for leisure activities.
 This is manages by Inland waterways.
