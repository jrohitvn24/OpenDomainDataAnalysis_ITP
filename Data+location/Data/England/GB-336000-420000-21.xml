Approximately 15 years ago the site was bought by Redrow Homes,except the " Hospital " which was left empty and had not been used for some years. (Private Owner) the building was vandalized, fell into disrepair, and was finally pulled down around 2009.&lt;br />&lt;br />About 200 new homes now occupy the site, but some of the hospital houses remain after refurbishment by Redrow.&lt;br />&lt;br />The driveway down to the Hospital is still tree lined and has daffodils on each side in springtime.&lt;br />&lt;br />A leisure centre run by West Lancashire District Council occupies part of the site along with a new junior school. The Leisure Centre is well used by the community one of these being a group called the Nifty Fifties, formed for exercise and friendship on a doctors referal scheme.   &lt;br />
