		<title>13Mattingley - Social Concerns</title>
		<content> One of the main concerns of the local 
 inhabitants is the{threat of the      
{proposed mini-town}which may be built 
 between Hook &amp; Mattingley. Although a 
 5 year reprieve has been granted, 1991
 is not that far off!                  
   Another real concern is the{threat  
{to commonland}such as Hazeley Heath &amp; 
 Mattingley Green. Due to a 'loophole' 
 in a recent Government paper the land 
 isn't as safe as it should be.        
   Although most of the inhabitants of 
 the block chose to live there, some   
 would like the{shops}to be nearer &amp;   
 would like{mains drainage}&amp; the option
 of{gas}for their heating &amp; cooking.   
 Some are rather concerned that the    
 nearest{doctor's surgery}is at Hook or
 Hartley Wintney - a distance of 3     
 miles in most cases.
