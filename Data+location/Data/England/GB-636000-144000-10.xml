		<title>10THE OLD SCHOOL-LIBRARY</title>
		<content>                                       
     St.Margaret's Library was once the
 village school.This was built in 1847 
 and was used as a school until 1971   
 when the school was transferred to a  
 new building.                         
   In 1971 St.Margarets Bay Trust took 
 it over and converted  it into a      
 community centre.It is now used by a  
 playgroup,a luncheon club and the     
 library as well as being available for
 meetings of clubs or societies for a  
 small fee.                            
   When Paul,Tony and Garry interviewed
 the part-time librarian Mrs Dixon,she 
 told them there were about 3000 books 
 in this library.Sometimes books are   
 stolen from us and not returned but   
 they usually turn up at jumble sales. 
 The most regular customers are elderly
 people.
