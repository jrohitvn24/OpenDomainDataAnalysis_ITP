		<content>{PARISH HALL}The village lacks a modren
 hall or centre for holding meetings   
 and large functions.A committee has   
 been set up for the purpose of        
 acquiring a site and to raise funds   
 for its purchase and for the building.
 Outline planning permission has been  
 granted on the land adjacent and to   
 the west of the parish playing field. 
 On 22nd.July 1985 the proposed plans  
 for the new hall were on view to the  
 public and comments were invited. The 
 building as on this plan would include
 public toilets  which would have      
 separate access,an amenity which the  
 village does not have at present.     
{COUNTY ROADS }The Parish Council has  
 received plans of proposed road       
 classifications in the county. Concern
 is felt for the low grade given to the
 road leading south from the village to
 the main Exeter -Barnstaple road.     </content>
