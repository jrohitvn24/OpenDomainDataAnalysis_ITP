		<title>01NORTH CHESHIRE COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> This area is one of typical Cheshire  
 countryside - in the main flat and    
 devoted to dairy farming.  The fields 
 are of average size, separated by     
 hedges which are kept severely cut by 
 machine in most cases.  There are many
 hedgerow trees, mostly oak, and also  
 numerous groups of trees, too small to
 be designated woodland.  There is one 
 small village, Antrobus, in the West. 
 The area is dotted with prosperous    
 looking farms and outbuildings -      
 density, 3 or 4 per sq.Km., and       
 isolated quality houses, sometimes    
 halftimbered.                         
 There are 2 large properties. The NE  
 corner is occupied by a small "stately
 home" - Arley Hall. This atands in its
 own parkland &amp; is open to the public  
 in the summer months. Its gardens are 
 famous. In the south is Belmont Hall  
 which is now an independent day school</content>
