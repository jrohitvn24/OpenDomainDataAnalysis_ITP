		<title>13Tourism at Chatsworth</title>
		<content>    The B6012 public road runs parallel
 to the River Derwent almost through   
 the centre of Chatsworth Park. From   
 the highest point on this road there  
 is an excellent view of the House.    
  There is an age-old tradition of free
 access to the Park and woodland       
 surrounding Chatsworth.               
    The principal Estate village of    
 Edensor lies to the west of the House 
 within the Park. Built as a model     
 village in the mid-nineteenth century,
 it has a fine Church, a Post Office   
 and a Tea Room and provides housing   
 for Estate employees and pensioners.  
    Pilsley village further north is   
 also an Estate village with its own   
 school,Post Office and Public House.  
 The Chatsworth Farm Shop and five     
 retail workshops provide local        
 employment and an additional tourist  
 attraction.                           </content>
