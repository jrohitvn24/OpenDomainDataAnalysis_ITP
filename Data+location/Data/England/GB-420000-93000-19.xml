		<title>19WILDLIFE IN HIGHCLIFFE</title>
		<content>   In Highcliffe we see a lot of birds.
 Our most common bird is the seagull   
 but we also see sparrows, blackbirds  
 crows and herons. We have seen 22     
 large trees with more than 5 crows and
 blackbirds nesting. In the winter we  
 see a lot of robins. We see a lot of  
 rodents and our most common is the    
 rabbit. We sometimes see foxes. We    
 have heathland where we see lizards.  
 We have a lot of trees in Highcliffe. 
 Our most common tree is the pine tree,
 but we also see oak, silver birch and 
 beech. We also see many gorse and     
 rhododendron bushes. We have two      
 commons and we have heathland on one  
 of them. All our commons are          
 interesting because they have a lot of
 birds, rodents, animals and trees.
