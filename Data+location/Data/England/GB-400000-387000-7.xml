		<title>07LANTERN PIKE,PEAK DISTRICT</title>
		<content> I was standing 970 feet above sea     
 level.It was very windy and my papers 
 were flying about.When I finally got  
 everything sorted out,I started to    
 write notes about what I could see    
 from the top.I could see all of New   
 Mills,Thornsett,and Rowarth.From this 
 height New Mills looked like it had   
 been built in a valley.We could not   
 see Thornsett School.It was behind a  
 hill.If I looked to the right I could 
 see the path we walked on to get to   
 the place that I was on.We were about 
 200 feet from the top point of Lantern
 Pike.The wind was so strong it took me
 about 15 minutes to get all my papers 
 sorted out.Aspenshaw wood,which we had
 walked through earlier on,was straight
 ahead of me,so was wimberry wood.We   
 could see clearly from here most of   
 the fields were used for grazing.Only 
 a few were cultivated.                </content>
