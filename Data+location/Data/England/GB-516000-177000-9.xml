		<content>  {"Put the heart back into Ealing"    
 was the phrase used by the Ealing     
 Alliance Group which was started in   
 1967. Mrs Anthony, a member of{Ealing 
{Civic Society,}told us that the       
 Council's original plans for Ealing   
 Centre included concrete towers, six  
 rows of traffic through Mattock Lane  
 and the demolition of part of the     
 Uxbridge Road. {                      
{                                      
 The{Civic Society}and other groups    
 made a plan which was right for       
 Ealing. The Alliance group won their  
 fight against the Council's plans. Now
 people are moving into the area again.
{                                      
 Mrs Anthony said,                     
   "If you think something is right    
 stick to it. In Ealing what people say
 matters."
