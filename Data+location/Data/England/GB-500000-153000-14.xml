		<title>14SANDPITS IN SEND</title>
		<content> Send, as its name suggests, has been  
 well known since the 19th century for 
 its sand and associated industry. Sand
 and gravel pits are still being dug by
 Halls Aggregates Ltd. Local people are
 permitted to dig certain pits for     
 themselves provided no mechanical     
 means are used. Some of those pits no 
 longer being worked have been flooded 
 and are used for water activities. An 
 Angling Club provides private fishing 
 in disused gravel pits known as The   
 Lakes, and the Sailing Club is sited  
 on Papercourt Lake. These areas of    
 water also attract a variety of birds 
 including large flocks of visiting    
 Canada geese. In some cases the pits  
 have been filled with domestic rubbish
 and levelled, covered with topsoil and
 landscaped.These areas cannot be built
 on for a number of years, although    
 some earlier sites are now built on.  </content>
