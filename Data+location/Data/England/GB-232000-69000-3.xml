		<content>    If I were spending a sunny day, in 
 the{Callington}and{Golberdon}area I   
 would get up in the morning and have  
 breakfast.                            
                                       
                                       
    Then I'd get dressed and go out to 
 Majorettes for half an hour. I would  
 come back and have a walk in the{wood}
 and on the way back home I would get  
 some{shopping}for mum, dad, and me.   
 After that I would go to the{river    
{beach}and sunbathe. I would cycle     
 there. I would come back in time to   
 cook lunch.Later I would go to the    
 quarry.                               
                                       
 After a while I would go picnicking   
 at{Appledore Wood.}Then I'd come back 
 and do lots of jobs for mum and dad.  
 After I had done that the whole family
 would go to the{pub}and have tea out. </content>
