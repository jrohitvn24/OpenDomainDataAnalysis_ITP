		<title>19Industry Gravel Extraction 1</title>
		<content> In the north-eastern part of our area 
 an extensive area of land is given    
 over to the extraction of sand and    
 gravel. These deposits were laid down 
 by the River Welland, and are now     
 exploited comercially by Tarmac Ltd.  
 About fourteen separate pits fall     
 within our area, though the majority  
 of them are now worked out and have   
 been naturalised to form an attractive
 amenity. The materials dug from these 
 pits was used within the construction 
 industry, especially within the       
 Peterborough area. They have proved   
 particularly useful over the last     
 decade or so, as Peterborough has     
 grown so rapidly, with a great deal of
 new building and the associated roads 
 and shopping complexes attendant on   
 such growth.
