		<title>04       HELE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> My name is Sally.I am the only person 
 in the class who lives at Hele.My mum 
 has lived there all her life.The      
 village is separated by a main road.I 
 live in one long street with the beach
 at the end,where I take the dog for a 
 walk.My brother borrows a boat to go  
 out and put down lobster pots and go  
 crabbing and fishing.On our side of   
 the road we have a garage,a postoffice
 and general stores,a newsagents,a     
 launderette,a cafe,two restaurants,a  
 pub,holiday chalets and a car park.   
 Across the main road is the old gas   
 works which is used for a coal depot  
 and for small industrial work shops.  
 There is another holiday camp and the 
 traffic is such a nuisance in the     
 summer that my mum and dad will not   
 let me ride my bicycle.The rest of the
 year it is quiet and peaceful.
