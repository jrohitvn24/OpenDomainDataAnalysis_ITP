 OUR SCHOOL IS SMALL AND AT PRESENT HAS
 ONLY 18 CHILDREN AGED FOUR TO         
 ELEVEN.THE BUILDING IS OLD WITH HIGH  
 CEILINGS AND IS NOT VERY              
 COMFORTABLE.IT ONLY HAS TWO           
 CLASSROOMS,ONE SMALL OFFICE AND       
 TOILETS.WE USE THE VILLAGE HALL FOR   
 P.E. AND WE EAT OUR LUNCH THERE, BUT  
 IN WINTER IT IS NOT VERY CONVENIENT TO
 HAVE TO WALK THERE. OUR GAMES FIELD IS
 EVEN FURTHER AWAY. WE DON'T HAVE MANY 
 SCHOOL RULES BECAUSE IT IS ONLY A     
 LITTLE SCHOOL AND WE ARE ALL VERY     
 GOOD!WE ALL PREFER OUR SMALL SCHOOL   
 EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE A SMART     
 BUILDING AND LOTS OF EQUIPMENT,BECAUSE
 IT IS FRIENDLY AND WE ALL FEEL LIKE   
 ONE BIG FAMILY.LIFE FOR THE SCHOOL WAS
 MUCH BETTER WHEN WE HAD THE VILLAGE   
 HALL WHICH IS NOW A FACTORY. WE MISS  
 THE SPACE AND THE EXTRA FACILITIES.   </content>
