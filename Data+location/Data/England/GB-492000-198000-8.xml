 brought out the{ZX80 in 1981}and the  
{ZX81 in 1982.}The{ZX Spectrum}followed
 in{1983}and the{QL in 1984.}Before    
 this, costly computers were really    
 just for experts. Then ordinary people
 started to become interseted in them, 
 mainly for playing games. The early   
 computer owners were handy with a     
 soldering iron and often were         
 electricians or electronics experts   
 themselves. When I first got my       
 Spectrum I just played games, and then
 tried to write simple programs in     
{BASIC.}It was at the school computer  
 club that I first encountered{LOGO    
 crowded around an{Apple II}learning   
 with our teacher. Now we have
