		<content> "Great Brickhill,Little Brickhill     
  And Brickhill with the Bow,          
  There stand the three Brickhills,    
  All in a row."                       
                                       
 This local rhyme reminds us that there
 are three Brickhills."Brickhill with  
 the Bow" at the time of our survey had
 a population of approx.670.           
  The old name for this village was    
 "Bolle Brichelle".Brichelle meaning   
 hilltop and Bolle being formed from   
 Boel the name of a family associated  
 with the village in the 12th century. 
  The village has developed on either  
 side of the B557 road linking         
 Bletchley with Woburn Sands.Villagers 
 all agreed that the most noticable    
 change to their lives over the past 10
 years has been the coming of the new  
 city of Milton Keynes.
