		<title>13CONIFEROUS WOODLAND ON ARNE</title>
		<content>   Coniferous woodland was planted by  
 the landowners with Scots Pine and    
 Maritime Pine for commercial use.Such 
 a habitat has a very poor species     
 diversity when compared to deciduous  
 woodland because of the dense shade   
 engendered by the close planting which
 restricts or even eliminates          
 completely the ground flora.Also the  
 thick covering of pine needles        
 restricts plant growth.Jays and Wood  
 Pigeons nest in the trees with several
 species of Tits and the Gold-crested  
 Wren seen in the open borders;small   
 herds of Sika and Roe deer;Grey       
 Squirrels and the ant hills of the    
 large black wood ants, which are the  
 most obvious invertebrate inhabitants 
 of the forest floor, can also be seen.
