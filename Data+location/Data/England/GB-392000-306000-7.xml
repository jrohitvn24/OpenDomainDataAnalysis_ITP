		<content>Grave concern is felt in the area about
pollution from the industrial complex  
one mile west of Calf Heath comprising 
three major chemicals factories.       
Villagers are worried about the        
possible health hazard of inhaling     
toxic fumes and annoyed by the fallout 
of sooty carbon particles.The major    
concern is the possible carcinogenic   
effects of fumes from a tyre processing
plant.An investigation by a government 
air pollution expert is at present     
under way,and villagers are holding    
their own survey spearheaded by a local
action committee.A calendar of noxious 
smells and fallout is being compiled by
householders within a three mile       
radius,although complaints have been   
received from Stafford lO miles north  
and Lichfield lO miles south           
respectively.
