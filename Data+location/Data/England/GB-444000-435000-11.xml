		<title>11A SCHOOLGIRL'S STORY</title>
		<content>   I get up for school at 8 o'clock,   
 but at the weekends I stay in bed     
 till 10 o'clock. I have a cup of      
 coffee first. Then I feed the rabbits 
 before I go to school.                
   I'm not so keen on school, or doing 
 school work. I look after the school  
 bank with Nancy. I like to do         
 gymnastics on the mat. My favourite   
 friend after school is Nicola. We play
 tig and hide and seek on her front    
 lawn.                                 
   My favourite food is strawberries   
 and cream, my favourite drink is      
 shandy. I go to the riding school     
 every Thursday and All Saints Club    
 every Tuesday. After school I buy some
 sweets and then go home. I feed the   
 rabbits then play outside then watch  
 television. I don't much like helping 
 in the house. I go to bed at 10       
 o'clock.                              </content>
