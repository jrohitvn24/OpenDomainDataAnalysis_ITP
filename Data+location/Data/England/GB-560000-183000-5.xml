		<title>05TILLINGHAM HALL</title>
		<content>   Tillingham Hall is the proposed     
 development of a country town between 
{Bulphan}and{West Horndon.}Consortium  
 Developments propose to build 5000    
 houses on{green belt}land. The Bulphan
 and West Horndon villagers don't agree
 with this.  There are two M.P.s       
 involved. They are{Harvey Proctor}and 
{Bob McCrindle}.                       
   There has been a Residents          
 Association formed. They are totally  
 against it. Nearly everyone in Bulphan
 and West Horndon are against it. We   
 are afraid that such a development    
 will totally destroy the{atmosphere}of
 village life in these parts. There    
 have been many recent reports in the  
{national}and{local newspapers.        
{  Channel 4}and{Anglia Television}have
 both visited our village recently to  
 make programmes about the argument.
