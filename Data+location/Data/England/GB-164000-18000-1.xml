		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF THE BLOCK</title>
		<content> This block is a coastal, rural area   
 containing most of one village,Mullion
 and a small number of residences      
 scattered throughout the countryside. 
 It is an area extremely popular with  
 holidaymakers, particularly in the    
 summer months, when high unemployment 
 levels fall to some extent. The main  
 attraction of the area is its         
 magnificent coastal scenery and small 
 sandy coves. Mixed farming is         
 practised; cattle are reared for beef 
 and for their milk, fodder crops are  
 grown, as well as early potatoes. In  
 most areas it is too exposed for      
 flowers and vegetables. Mullion is the
 largest village on the Lizard         
 peninsula and has the largest number  
 of shops. Most of these depend in some
 way on tourism to support their       
 income. The Comprehensive school for  
 the area is just outside this block.  </content>
