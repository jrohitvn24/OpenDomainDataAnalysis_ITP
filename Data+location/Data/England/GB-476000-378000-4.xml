		<title>04STOKEHAM VILLAGE</title>
		<content> I have just moved into Stokeham from  
 Derbyshire.It is very small and the   
 houses are built around the village   
 centre. There are several farms and   
 about twenty houses. The village      
 church is very small. The people are  
 nice and frfiendly. We go to Rampton  
 School by mini-bus, and when I leave  
 to go to secondary school I will have 
 to travel by bus into Retford.Stokeham
 has no shops. The nearest shop is in  
 Rampton or in Woodbeck. I like it here
 because it is quiet and I enjoy being 
 on my own.
