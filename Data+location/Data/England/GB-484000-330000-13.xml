		<title>13THE LIFE OF AN 8 YEAR OLD</title>
		<content> We have one pet,it is a cat called    
 Miff but Grandma takes care of her    
 because Sally and I are at work and so
 are Mummy and Daddy but when we get   
 home we take care of her. We have 5   
 rooms in our house. It is very old it 
 is 200 years old. It is made of stone.
 It has a garden with a lot of flowers 
 and two swings.In the kitchen we have 
 wooden chairs. In the sitting room    
 there is a soft chair that spins round
 and a hard chair with a cushion on it 
 and a soft settee. I go to Denton     
 school. There are two classes infants 
 and juniors. We write stories we do   
 maths we do gym too. We do art,we draw
 things like birds, trees, animals and 
 we paint as well. The junior class is 
 the biggest class. The teachers are   
 called Mrs Onions she is the junior   
 teacher and Miss Wilkinson is the     
 infant teacher.                       </content>
