		<title>20M.O.D. AT LUDDESDOWN</title>
		<content> In November, l982, it became known    
 that the Ministry of Defence was      
 planning to take over 63O acres of    
 land at Luddesdown for military       
 purposes.                             
 An Action Group was set up, supported 
 by organisations such as, The Ramblers
 Association and The British Horse     
 Society, to fight this proposal.They  
 raised Â£8OOO by selling posters,      
 papers, badges and book marks, by     
 having a barbeque, walking, cycling   
 and organising equestrian events.     
 In November l983, a public enquiry    
 was held.The M.O.D. emphasised the    
 need to train officers and NCO's in   
 mine laying techniques.The Action     
 Group produced experts who explained  
 how this would ruin Luddesdown's      
 tranquility and rural beauty.The      
 M.O.D. were denied approval in        
 December l984.                        </content>
