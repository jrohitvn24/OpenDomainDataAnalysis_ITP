		<title>04EAST GRINSTEAD HIGH ST SHOPS</title>
		<content> East grinstead is a wealthy area and  
 its medaeval high street reflects     
 this. The highest general rates in the
 town are paid by these shops and few  
 mundane articles are on sale. No chain
 stores are here, but small independent
 shops. Goods on sale include clothes, 
 leather items, crafts, gifts, books,  
 antiques, soft furnishings and fitted 
 kitchens. Just off the High St is     
 Safeways. Supermarkets epitomise the  
 80's trend towards large shops selling
 a wide range of items. Safeways       
 includes a chemists, bakers, off      
 license &amp; newsagents as well as a     
 large range of groceries &amp; has its own
 car park. Inevitably trade is taken   
 away from the smaller shops. The whole
 town is now served by 2 supermarkets  
 &amp; one smaller grocer. The independent 
 shops support a thriving Chamber of   
 Commerce.                             </content>
