		<content>   Hobstone's Farm,which maybe observed
 near the edge of Lake Burwain as one  
 looks towards the sailing club from   
 Red Lane,has traditionally been the   
 venue of hauntings and strange        
 happenings.Inhabitants have reported  
 the movement of an oak wardrobe which 
 only two men could replace,and milk   
 bottles and other objects being flung 
 mysteriously about.                   
   On the night of Sept 29th 1977 the  
 house was beseiged by demons when the 
 walls,ceiling and roofslates were     
 severely shaken and windows           
 smashed.There were believed to be 3   
 ghosts:a child full of mischief,an old
 lady reluctant to depart this life,and
 an aggressive farmer who had been     
 resident two centuries ago and who    
 resented the then occupants.Some      
 believe one ghost was a monk.Since the
 77 excorcism the farm has been silent.</content>
