		<title>18A NORMAL SATURDAY IN B.H.</title>
		<content>  Every other Saturday I work in my    
 grandads greengrocers shop. I take it 
 in turn with my cousin. If I am       
 working I will get up at 8.10 and     
 catch a tube from Theydon Bois where I
 live to Debden where the shop is. The 
 journey is only one stop and costs    
 20p. I start work at 9.00. My job is  
 to keep the place tidy by doing       
 various things and loading bags of    
 coal into my grandads large van. At   
 about 11:30 a.m we deliver the        
 coal orders to the houses. I finish   
 work at noon and get paid Â£4.00.      
 Normally I go up to my nans for some  
 thing to eat before I go home.The     
 after noon I spend leisurely. During  
 the football season I go and see      
 Arsenal play.If I don't go out I will 
 just stay at home watching the sport  
 on T.V.During the evening we either   
 have visitors or go out ourselves.    </content>
