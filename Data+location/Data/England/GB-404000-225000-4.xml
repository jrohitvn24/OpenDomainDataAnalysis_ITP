		<content> There are few buildings in this area  
 of large fields and woodland patches. 
 The traditional building material is  
 stone, which is used for houses, barns
 and field boundary walls.  There are  
 several small quarries which are no   
 longer used and remain as waste land. 
 Most dwellings are built of stone.    
 These are the farmhouses and the      
 former farm cottages.  Sudeley Lodge  
 is an early eighteenth century ashlar 
 faced stone house with a hipped stone 
 roof. These are also more modern      
 buildings, one is a bungalow.         
 Farm buildings are also built of      
 modern materials such as concrete and 
 corigated metal.                      
 Some dry stone walls survive and where
 they have fallen down, the gaps are   
 patched with posts and wire.  This    
 type of fencing is also used to edge  
 some fields.                          </content>
