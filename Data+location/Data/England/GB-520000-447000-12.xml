		<title>12HORNSEA GAMES - WEMBLEY</title>
		<content> All you need are two items of clothing
 to form a goal and a small ball. The  
 number of players you need is between 
 three and ten.                        
                                       
 The rules are that you are not allowed
 to kick or push your opponents but you
 have to tackle fairly. To do this you 
 take the ball from your opponent      
 without making much body contact.     
                                       
 The object of the game is to kick the 
 ball between the two items of         
 clothing. You must not touch the ball 
 with your hands unless you are the    
 "goalie".                             
                                       
 A "goalie" is a person who stands     
 between the items of clothing and     
 tries not to let the ball past him. He
 can use any part of his body to stop  
 the ball.               Richard Worley</content>
