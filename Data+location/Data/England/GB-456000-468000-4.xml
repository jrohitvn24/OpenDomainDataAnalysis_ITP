		<title>04Early History,Crayke Village</title>
		<content> The name Crayke comes from the Celtic 
 word for rock or crag, and has been   
 spelt in many ways in the past, Creca,
 Cric, Creic, Crec, Crayk, Crek, Craik 
 and finally  Crayke. It was situated  
 on an ancient Celtic trackway to the  
 Tees via Hambelton Hills, traces of   
 the early occupation of the site      
 include the finding of Roman, Saxon   
 and Viking items.                     
                                       
 From very early farming has been te   
 mainstay of Crayke. By Saxon times 240
 acres were cultivated close around the
 village, later the outer woodland were
 cleared to form large ox and horse    
 pastures and between 1680 and 1760 of 
 these were divided into smaller fields
 and in the same period outlying       
 farmhouses were built.
