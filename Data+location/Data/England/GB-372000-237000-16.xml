		<content>  The landscape around Eastnor is      
{generally hilly and picturesque,      
 as it lies on the south-west end of   
 the Malvern Hills.Its scenery is that 
 of{grazing pasture and farm land.     
 The parkland area around Eastnor      
 Castle is particularly attractive.    
  The land is mostly very fertile but  
 is clay and poor for crop growing and 
 farming by White House farm.In the    
 Sitch wood area the ground is soggy   
 and suitable for sheep only.In the    
 second field by Sitch wood there is a 
 windpump which unfortunately stopped  
 working three years ago.In the park   
 there are six hundred deer and sheep. 
  The ground by the Obelisk is hilly   
 and unsuitable for cattle.Around      
 Bronsil Castle there is marshland.Much
 of the area is wooded and there are   
 fine examples of rare trees in the    
 Castle grounds.                       </content>
