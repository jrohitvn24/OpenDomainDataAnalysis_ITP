		<title>16THE HOLLOW, SHREWTON</title>
		<content> The burial ground known as The Hollow,
 is a steep narrow hill leading onto a 
 Bridleway known locally as The Cleave,
 which has lovely views of Shrewton and
 Orcheston and comes out at the Gibbett
 - a well known landmark from the past.
 Properties have been built on both    
 sides of the Hollow, and they range   
 from very old thatched cottages, to   
 modern  bungalows.  The high walled   
 entrances to many of the properties   
 were once used to house air raid      
 shelters during the second world war. 
 The left hand side is within the      
 Parish of Shrewton whilst the right   
 hand side belongs to Orcheston, and is
 consequently rated lower than Shrewton
 Recently the remains of a{Beakerman}  
 was dug up in one of the gardens, and 
 it can now be seen in the Salisbury   
 Museum.                               
                                       </content>
