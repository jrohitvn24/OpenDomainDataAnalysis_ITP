		<content>   100 years ago, Dartmouth School     
 was in what is now the Guildhall.     
  {DARTMOUTH SCHOOL and COMMMUNITY     
{COLLEGE}today is a comprehensive      
 school occupying two sites, one on    
 Victoria Road (built in 1919), and the
 other in Milton Lane (built in 1975). 
   The{Victoria Road}site has seen many
 changes. It was an all boys school,   
 later a mixed Secondary Modern and    
 finally a Comprehensive School and    
 Community College.                    
   The number of pupils on roll this   
 year is{480.}In 1983 it was announced 
 that the school would close in about 5
 years time, because the number of     
 pupils was expected to drop below that
 for which a comprehensive curriculum  
 could be maintained. The{community    
 contested the figures and protested so
 strongly that the school was saved    
 subject to a review.                  </content>
