		<title>12NEWBURY AGRICULTURAL SHOW</title>
		<content>   Each year the Newbury and District  
 Agricultural Society holds a big show.
 In 1985 the Society has acquired a    
 permanent site at Prior's Court of    
 approximately 130 acres.              
   At the show there are around 400    
 stands, but if all the small          
 exhibitors in the flower tent, the    
 food marquee and the rural craft tent 
 are included the number increases to  
 nearer 550.                           
   Attractions for 1985 include a      
 festival of transport, two military   
 bands, the Red Devils parachute team, 
 hot air balloons, heavy horses and    
 show jumping.                         
   At each show there are competitions 
 for horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and 
 pigs. In addition there are           
 competitions for growing crops and the
 best farmed farm.
