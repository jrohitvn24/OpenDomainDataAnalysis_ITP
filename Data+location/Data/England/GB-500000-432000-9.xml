		<title>09Cottingham High School.</title>
		<content>  When I am 11 I will leave this school
 and go to Cottingham High School. We  
 do not call it this, it is usually    
 known as Harland Way because that is  
 where it is.                          
  It is a very big school compared to  
 ours. It has 1600 students. It was    
 opened in 1955. It was not always a   
 school, it used to be a big house and 
 when my group looked round it we saw  
 some of the old garden walls. Many of 
 the trees in the grounds were planted 
 when the school was an old house. Our 
 guide, a teacher at the school, said  
 you could tell the history of the     
 school by the trees.                  
  The teacher also told us about the   
 school's ghost. It seems that when the
 school was being built an electrician 
 was killed under the stage. He tries  
 to escape by opening one of the stage 
 doors without being seen.             </content>
