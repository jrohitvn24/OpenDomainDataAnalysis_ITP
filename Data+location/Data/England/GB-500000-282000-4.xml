		<title>04BIRD AVIARIES/LILFORD PARK 1</title>
		<content>  Lilford Park is renown for its       
 collection of birds. The aviaries are 
 surrounded by the grounds of Lilford  
 Hall, owned by Lord Lilford. He has   
 always been very keen on birds and so 
 has collected these marvellous        
 creatures over the years .The         
 collection ranges from European       
 buzzards and rheas from South America 
 to parakeets from Asia and flamingoes 
 from South America. The park has a    
 pinetum which has two small lakes on  
 which there are breeding more than one
 hundred wildfowl representing sixteen 
 species. The main attraction of       
 Lilford Park are the aviaries which   
 were created between 1860-1890 by the 
 Fourth Baron Lilford. Under the       
 guidance of the present Lord          
 Lilford,the aviaries and flamingo pool
 have been restored and restocked.
