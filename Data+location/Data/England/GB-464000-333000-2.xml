		<title>02HOW TO PLAY BUNG OFF</title>
		<content> Any amount of people can play.        
                                       
 What you do is choose a post,then the 
 person thats on,counts to 100 in      
 1's slowly.While he or she's doing    
 that the rest hide.Then when the      
 counter finishes counting he or she   
 looks for the  people who are hidden. 
 If the counter sees a person, they    
 both run back to the post and if the  
 first person there is the hider, they 
 say "1 2 3 myself"and if it's the     
 counter "1 2 3 bung off_who ever it   
 is." If the counter says it first then
 that person is caught.If the hider    
 says it first then that person is     
 free.You carry on like this till      
 everyone's caught or free and then the
 first person caught is on for a new   
 game of                               
         B U N G   O F F.
