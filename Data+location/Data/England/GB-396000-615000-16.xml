		<title>16FARMING</title>
		<content> The major source of employment in this
 area is farming. By far the most      
 dominant type of farming is hill-     
 farming. It is only on the valley     
 floor and in well-sheltered areas that
 any arable farming can take place. On 
 these hill farms there tend to be two 
 main parts to the farm.               
   (a) In-by. This area consists of the
 farm buildings and fields which are   
 fenced and/or walled. Hay is often an 
 important crop. It is here where the  
 farmer will try to keep his less-hardy
 stock, especially in severe winter    
 weather.                              
   (b) Out-by. This area tends to      
 consist of open unfenced moorland.    
 Stock can roam over a wide area.      
 Shepherds use horses to help them     
 check their flocks.                   
   The major land-owner in this area is
 The Duke of Northumberland.           </content>
