		<content> Kineton is situated in an undulating  
 landscape in a valley bounded by Edge 
 Hill (Cotswold Range) to the south and
 some low-lying hills of the Midland   
 Plain to the north. The valley has    
 been produced by a small brook called 
 the River Dene.                       
   The oldest part of the village is   
 still the centre where a number of old
 stone houses, some thatched, others   
 slated, date back to the seventeenth  
 century. A little development took    
 place early this century but most of  
 the "outer" village has been built    
 since the war.                        
  {Building materials}in the village   
 are a mixture of stones and modern    
 brick. The church and other buildings 
 are constructed with Cotswold and     
 Hornton ironstone, others of blue lias
 limestone which tends to flake as it  
 weathers.                             </content>
