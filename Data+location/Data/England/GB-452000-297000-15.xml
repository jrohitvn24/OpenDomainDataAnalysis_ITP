		<title>15JUNIOR FOOTBALL</title>
		<content>   We play football for Narborough and 
 Littlethorpe Football club. We are a  
 team of under10s.We play at the       
 playing fields near the M1 bridge     
 every Sunday between October and May. 
   We train on Wednesdays and Saturdays
 in Winter. First we do some warm-ups, 
 like jogging round the field. Then we 
 do passing skills. We have to pass the
 ball to each other. Sometimes we do   
 heading skills. That is very hard.    
   When we are all warm we play a game.
 Lots of the players' brothers come to 
 play.They nearly always win.We play   
 for about an hour.I like to play in   
 goal best. My friend likes to play    
 forward. The best feeling in soccer is
 scoring the winner or saving a        
 penalty.                              
  At the end of the season we each get 
 a trophy.I will get the Golden Boot   
 for scoring most goals.               </content>
