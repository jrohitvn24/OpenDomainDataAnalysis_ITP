		<content>    Each of the villages had it's own  
 primary school but in 1985 only       
 Morland Area C.E.School remains.These 
 closures were due to rural            
 depopulation and L.E.A. closure       
 policy.Above the age of 11 years      
 pupils attend either Appleby Grammar  
 School or Penrith Ullswater School.   
    Morland has four schools! The      
 earliest was held in the church       
 transept about 1700.Then a new school 
 was built in the square in 1760, this 
 being superceded by the Victorian     
 Morland and Newby school on the Newby 
 road built in 1872.                   
     This was transferred to the new   
 Morland Area C.E.school in 1974 and   
 this caters for the needs of all      
 primary children from the villages of 
 Morland, Sleagill, Newby and Little   
 Strickland.There being 86 on role in  
 the summer of 1985.                   </content>
