		<content>     The Chasetown public thought the  
police did a good job as far as they   
could, but believed there should be    
more police on the beat in Chasetown.  
     The local police take an active   
part in the community and run a Police 
Youth Activity Scheme in summer,       
organising coach trips, games, sports  
and coaching activities.               
     The main kind of transport used by
police at Chasetown Police Station is  
the Ford Escort car.This is often      
called a "panda" car.The cars are      
changed every two or three years.The   
Police have to respond as quickly as   
possible to about two or three         
emergency calls per week.Detailed      
information on numbers of cars and     
staff is classified.
