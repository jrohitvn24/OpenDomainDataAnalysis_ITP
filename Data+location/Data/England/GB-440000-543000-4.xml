		<title>04Easington Colliery (cont)</title>
		<content> On Tuesday May 29th 1951 there was a  
 terrible explosion at Easington       
 Colliery and 81 men were killed. Most 
 of the dead are buried in the local   
 cemetery. In the Welare Park, close by
 a tree was planted for every man who  
 died. From March 1984 all the miners  
 were on strike. The strike lasted for 
 a year and caused great hardship for  
 all the people in Easington Colliery. 
 In June 1985 many families are just   
 beginning to recover from the effects 
 of the strike. Ian's dad is a miner at
 the colliery. He wrote "My dad gets up
 in the middle of the night to go to   
 work. He often takes bread and jam to 
 eat when he is at work down the pit.  
 He is a face worker and he travels on 
 an underground electric train to reach
 the coal face which is nearly seven   
 miles out under the sea.
