    The two main housing areas are     
 Croftlands-a modern housing estate    
 containing a mixture of council and   
 owner occupied detached and           
 semi-detached houses and bungalows-   
 and Bardsea, a small village of       
 terraced stone cottages with some     
 modern development. There are a few   
 farms in the area and several flats in
 the grounds of Conishead Priory.      
    In a sample taken of children      
 living on the Croftlands Estate,12%   
 lived in detached houses and 88% in   
 semi-detached.The average number of   
 rooms in the houses was 7 and the     
 average family size was 4 people.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
