		<content> To start off with you need quite a bit
 of pasture fenced off, some sugar beet
 pulp for the winter when grass is     
 short, a kind heart and some money.   
 We got our two sheep for Â£15 each when
 they were three months old and we've  
 had them ever since. They are sheared 
 once a year, round about the time of  
 June, and also dipped so that they    
 submerge in a kind of disinfectant    
 which kills parasites like ticks and  
 lice. We usually sell our wool to     
 local spinners for about Â£10, which is
 a very generous price, because the    
 Wool Marketing Board give 75 pence per
 kilo for the wool from our type of    
 sheep. They are Jacob sheep with a    
 black and white fleece. It is better  
 to have two sheep rather than one, so 
 that they can keep each other company.
 We take them around in our car, but   
 with a lot a lorry would be better.   </content>
