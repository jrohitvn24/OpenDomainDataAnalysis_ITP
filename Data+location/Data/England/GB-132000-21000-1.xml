		<title>01Nanjizel Bay, St. Levan.</title>
		<content>{Nanjizel}is an isolated and pictureque
 bay{two kilometres south of Land's    
{End.}The cliffs are of{granite}which  
{results in a 'castellated' appearance 
 due to weathering of the joints in    
 this rock. Each headland looks like   
 a giant's tumbled pile of bricks as a 
 result. West Penwith is part of an    
{igneous batholith}which outcrops on   
{Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor, Carnmenellis   
 and the{Isles of Scilly.}Between these
 outcrops is metamorphic slate, called 
 'killas' by miners. Various{mineral   
{ores are found at the boundary of     
{these two rocks.}Nanjizel has typical 
 granite cliff scenery, rugged yet less
 ominous in appearance than slate      
 cliffs.{Low tide reveals many rock    
{pools filled with crabs, sea anenomes 
{and limpets.}A sandbar in the bay     
 means that the cove gains or loses a  
 beach as sand is washed in and out.   </content>
