		<content> Seamer is an old village,made up of   
 Seamer,Irton and Crossgates.The       
 population today is about 3400 and    
 since 1945 it has tripled.A lot of the
 old residents still live here and many
 people come here to retire.Most of    
 them worked on the land,but people    
 moved into the area and developed     
 local industries.There is an old      
 peoples community centre now,and trips
 and fun competitions are organised for
 them.Seamer means"mere by the sea" _  
 there used to be a lake going through 
 Seamer,but now there is just an under 
 ground,artesian lake near Irton.There 
 aren't many shops,only two and a chip 
 shop.There have been new building     
 estates since 1960.Park Estate was the
 first and Eastgate,Crab Lane and      
 Stableton Close followed.In 1961 a war
 memorial hall was built,and Seamer is 
 only just getting a doctors surgery.  </content>
