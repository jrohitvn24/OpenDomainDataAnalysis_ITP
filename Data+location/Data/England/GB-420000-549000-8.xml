		<title>08LANGUAGE IN STANLEY</title>
		<content> The STANLEY dialect is harsh to       
 people from other areas.Pronunciation 
 of vowels is often undifferentiated   
 e.g.flat,grass,bat_the "a" is         
 identical                             
 put,cup,shut_the"u"is identical.      
 been and being , they and there_are   
 often indistinguishable in speech.    
 "r" is hardly pronounced at all,except
 as a useful sound to slide from one   
 word to another:"Where did he gerrit?"
 means "Where did he get it ?"         
 However "work" is pronounced "walk"   
 and "walk"is pronounced "waak".       
 There are few genuine dialect words   
 evident.                              
 a"netty"is a toilet,but most people   
 call it a "bog".                      
 "snaggas"are turnips,"canny"means good
 pleasant,nice.                        
 The most striking feature of the      
 language is its ideolect.   cont.     </content>
