		<content> Situated in a valley and with a       
 network of rivers running through it, 
 Chew Magna has always been susceptible
 to flooding.  It was in 1968 that the 
 Great Flood came. On 10th July heavy  
 rain in the afternoon was followed by 
 violent and prolonged thunderstorms,  
 which lasted for more than 6 hours.   
 The ground was unable to absorb the   
 volume of water and roads soon became 
 rivers, sweeping debris along with    
 them. Many low-lying houses were      
 flooded and residents were rescued    
 from first-floor windows. The Primary 
 School was just one of the buildings  
 flooded. Fortunately and miraculously 
 nobody drowned. An improved sluice    
 gate system has prevented subsequent  
 serious flooding in the village       
 although the possibility is always    
 there.A flood warden co-ordinator and 
 flood wardens are on stand-by.        </content>
