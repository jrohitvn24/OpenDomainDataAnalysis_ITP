		<content>    This Jacobean house is thought to  
 have been built for a prosperous      
 Wealden Ironmaster and was completed  
 in 1634, it is built of local sand-   
 stone. Its most famous inhabitant to  
 date was the author Rudyard Kipling,  
 who purchased it in 1902 and lived at 
 Bateman's until his death in 1936 with
 his American wife and their three     
 children. Upon her death she left the 
 House to the National Trust in loving 
 memory of her husband.                
    Today the Mill, House, Garaging and
 Gardens are open to the public, who   
 can enjoy the peace and tranquility of
 Kipings' home in the Sussex country-  
 side that he loved and wrote about.   
 Many of the spots within the house    
 itself, the garden and locality are   
 easily recognizable in the material he
 published while living at Bateman's.
