		<content>   TOURIST{ATTITUDES}WERE SURVEYED BY  
 ASKING ABOUT 100 VISITORS TO COMPLETE 
 A QUESTIONAIRE. WE FOUND THAT MOST    
 ARRIVED IN BATTLE BY CAR, BUT MANY    
 ARRIVED BY COACH. THE AVERAGE TIME    
 SPENT IN BATTLE WAS TWO HOURS. MOST   
 VISITORS CAME FROM THE SOUTH OF       
 ENGLAND, BUT MANY CAME FROM OTHER     
 PARTS OF BRITAIN AND SOME FROM WESTERN
 EUROPE AND AMERICA. MOST FOREIGN      
 VISITORS WERE TOURING ALL OF SOUTHERN 
 ENGLAND. MOST THOUGHT THE VILLAGE     
 INTERESTING AND THE ENTRNCE CHARGES AT
 THE ABBEY FAIR, ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD   
 HAVE LIKED CLEARER SIGNS TO GIVE      
 INFORMATION ABOUT THE BATTLEFIELD.    
 MOST INTENDED TO BUY SMALL SOUVENEIRS 
 SUCH AS POSTCARDS AND WERE GOING TO   
 HAVE TEA BEFORE THEY LEFT.
