 The school named St.John the Baptist  
 was a National School built in the    
 village in I8I9. Basically the school 
 building is original although         
 modifications were made in I968 and   
 I977. Inside, the classrooms have been
 refurbished to facilitate the         
 contemporary needs of everyday        
 education.                            
 Adjoining the school is a small hard  
 surface playground and a school       
 playing field  is situated in the     
 village,I/4 mile away.                
 There are two classes in the Junior   
 Department  of mixed age and ability  
 and the infant class is also of mixed 
 age and abilities.
