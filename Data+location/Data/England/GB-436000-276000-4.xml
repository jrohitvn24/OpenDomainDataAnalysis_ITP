		<title>04The Ecology of Coombe Pool.</title>
		<content>   Coombe Pool is an important part of 
 local history. It was dug out by men  
 when Capability Brown designed the new
 landscape of Coombe Park over 200     
 years ago. Only fishermen are usually 
 allowed around the pool because it is 
 a nature reserve. Fishermen say that  
 the pool is well stocked with roach,  
 tench, perch, pike, bream, carp and   
 zander, but the fish are overfed and  
 difficult to catch.                   
   There is a heronry on the North side
 and we have seen Canada Geese,Great   
 Crested Grebes,Mallards,Tufted Ducks, 
 Pochards,Swans,Pheasants,Owls,Wood    
 Pigeons,Wrens,woodpeckers,Tits and    
 Finches.                              
   Fishermen say they have seen these  
 animals - fox,rabbit,squirrel,brown   
 rats,water voles and hedgehogs.       
 More trees are going to be planted    
 around the west side of the pool soon.</content>
