		<title>09ST.MATTHEW'S SCHOOL &amp; CHURCH</title>
		<content> Our school is not very big. It's got  
 about 160 pupils in it. It has got a  
 playground which is quite big but no  
 playing field near the school         
 building. Next door is St. Matthew's  
 Church which has a large steeple      
 pointing to the sky. It has a vicarage
 in the grounds where our vicar, Mr.   
 Barnes, lives. The school is over 100 
 years old. It has high windows and    
 some of the brick doorways are still  
 arched. In the church there are       
 stained-glass windows with many       
 pictures of Jesus on them. Both the   
 church and the school are built of    
 grey stone. Around the windows are    
 barriers so people can't break them.  
 At the side of the church is a school 
 garden. We made a high fence to go    
 around the garden so that nobody can  
 damage the flowers and plants.
