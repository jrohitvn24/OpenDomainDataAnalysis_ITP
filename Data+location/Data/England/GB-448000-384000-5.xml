		<title>05Todwick - Proposed Airport</title>
		<content> Over the last few months there has    
 been talk about a new{airport}in      
{South Yorkshire.                      
 A survey from{SYCC}shows that in      
 between{109}to{155}two-way business   
 trips could use the airport every     
 day. After two years there would be   
 between{30,000}to{50,000}people       
 passing through the gates.            
 The {airport}would provide a regular  
 scheduled passenger service to{       
{Britain's major international         
{airports}and to short distance        
 destinatations. A site has not  been  
 chosen but one suggestion is at       
{Hardwick}west of Long Road. When it   
 is built the airport would have a     
 runway of about{1000m. The estimated  
{cost}is{Â£1.5}million,{75 jobs will be 
{created when building}the airport and 
 30 when it is operational.
