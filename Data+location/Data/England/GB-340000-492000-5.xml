		<title>05Farming in Winster valley</title>
		<content> Bryan House is a grade 2 listed farm  
 and runs a small general purpose and  
 delivery stable. Green Yew is the main
 beef raising farm, again near the     
 centre of the village, but grazing on 
 fertile paddocks down to the river.   
 Green Bank on the A5074 is much larger
 has two tower silos and a lot of other
 buildings all in use, breeds sheep.   
 The whole valley is dotted with       
 smaller ones which may only grow      
 vegetables, or have orchards for the  
 famous damson crop grown in this      
 district, and also apples and pears.  
 Very little is grown under glass in   
 these farms.
