		<title>03PARKESTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Parkeston has become, over the last   
 few years, an important issue in local
{politics.}The village itself has      
 gradually been dropping in numbers,   
 and the inhabitants fear that as this 
 trend continues more and more         
 facilities are being removed or not   
 up-dated within the area, so making it
 more likely for young people to leave 
 the village itself.Over the last three
 years the locals have been desparately
 trying to keep{Parkeston School}open, 
 for they say thet if this closes then 
 there will be no local school for the 
 village children to attend.However the
 School will close at the end of the   
 Summer Term this year, and it will be 
 a shame if this helps to bring about  
 the end of Parkeston.
