		<title>01Introducing the Peak Park</title>
		<content> On leaving the Sheffield boundary from
 the Owler Bar, Totley road or from the
 Eccleshall road across Dore moor, one 
 is immediately aware of having entered
 the beautiful Peak National Park by   
 the well known identification of a    
 large millstone at the side of the    
 road. The breathtaking hills and      
 valleys are interspersed with         
 woodland, wild moors and mysterious   
 edifices. The area can be reached on  
 foot by the more hardy visitors, by   
 car,bus,coach,bicycle or train. First 
 stop for many is the Fox House Inn,   
 beyond Parson House Farm. This Inn has
 become part of the local language. It 
 is a meeting place for ramblers, a    
 focal point for hikers, and a shelter 
 providing food, drink, and warmth     
 throughout the year.
