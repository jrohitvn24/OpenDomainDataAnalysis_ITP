		<title>13HOUSING</title>
		<content> The modern estates built in the last  
 20 years are mainly four bedroomed    
 houses. They are detached and classed 
 as executive housing. House prices in 
 this area are high. Some of the older 
 houses have sold off a part of their  
 garden for building.                  
   Each village has some Local         
 Authority housing but the area is     
 predominantly privately owned houses. 
 In some of the lanes connecting the   
 villages are some very large houses.  
   One resident remarked that when her 
 parents built their house 30 years ago
 it was the largest in the road. Now   
 many of the old cottages have been    
 demolished and their home appears very
 modest in comparison to the new       
 dwellings.                            
  Much of the farmland has disappeared 
 for housing.
