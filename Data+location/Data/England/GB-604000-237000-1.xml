		<content>The area of this block is mainly       
agricultural land with two small       
villages of Raydon and Great Wenham in 
the centre of each half of the block.  
Both these villages have a church and a
public house but no school.The         
residential housing tends to be        
clustered mainly around the church with
a few outlying farms.                  
The area is undulating and used for    
growing crops such as oil seed rape,   
barley and wheat.                      
Raydon comes from Reindun circa 1200   
meaning Rye Hill.It has a population of
430 raising a product of a penny rate  
of 500 pounds.                         
 Great Wenham was mentioned in the     
Domesday Book and comes from the old   
high german {winn} meaning pasture and 
{hamm} a hamlet.It has a population    
of 140 raising a penny rate of 178     
pounds                                 </content>
