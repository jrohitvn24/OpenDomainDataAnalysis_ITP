		<content>{Old}The footbridge over Lowbrook used 
 to be shrouded in fog, people in      
 Norton Lane had to guide travellers by
 calling them.                         
{Revived}"Beating the Bounds"          
 This is an old custom dating back     
 hundreds of years, in which newly sown
 crops are blessed and the extremities 
 of the Parish visited.Since maps did  
 not exist in the early times it was   
 customary to beat a somewhat reluctant
 choirboy at points along the boundary 
 in order that he might remember its   
 location in years to come.The Parish  
 of St. James, Shirley, of which       
 Tidbury Green is a part, revived the  
 custom as part of the 150th           
 anniversary celebrations of the       
 church in a sponsored form. It proved 
 to be such an enjoyable day out that  
 the walk is repeated each Rogation    
 Sunday .                              </content>
