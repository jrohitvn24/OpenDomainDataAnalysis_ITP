		<title>11NATURE RESERVES &amp; "SSSI"s</title>
		<content> Despite the removal of hedgerows and  
 the use of herbicides, the area still 
 has quite a rich limestone flora, par-
 ticularly along roadside verges (some 
 of which are Nature Reserves).        
  We have two "SSSI"s (Sites of Special
 Scientific Interest). One is noted for
 its small population of pasque flower.
 Intensive grazing by sheep maintains  
 ideal growing conditions, but means   
 the plants rarely flower. Bastard     
 toadflax also grows here.             
  The other SSSI, whose varied flora   
 includes felwort, rock rose, quaking  
 grass and wild thyme, was recently    
 damaged by the extraction of hardcore.
  The disused railway at Little Bytham 
 is a good habitat. Dragonflies and    
 glow-worms have been seen nearby.     
  A willow at Aunby has dogrose, elder,
 hawthorn and redcurrant growing in the
 junction of its trunk and branches!   </content>
