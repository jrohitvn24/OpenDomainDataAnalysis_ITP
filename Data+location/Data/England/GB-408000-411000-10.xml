		<title>10Life on Sycamore Farm Helme</title>
		<content> Sycamore Farm was originally part of  
 Helme Hall Estate.The farm house and  
 cottages were used as a candle factory
 and oil refinery befoe conversion.    
                                       
 Usually farms in this area are hill   
 farms where the land is suitable only 
 for grazing.Land in Helme is          
 reasonably good but still is          
 considered a less-favoured area.Grants
 can therefore be claimed from the     
 Ministry of Agriculture for certain   
 things e.g. ploughing,re-seeding,wall 
 building,new buildings or extensions. 
                                       
 To supplement the income from the     
 farm, Mr.Hague takes driving jobs and 
 snow ploughing in the winter while    
 Mrs.Hague works full time as a        
 non-teaching assistant at Helme       
 School.
