 West St.                              
                                       
West St. runs from the church to       
Northampton Rd. On the south side are  
old stone buildings which pre-date the 
fire which destroyed much of Old Earls 
Barton.A few stone buildings remain on 
the North side of the street.          
  Next to the Hairdresser's are two    
stone cottages knocked into one.The    
present use is as a Doctor's Surgery   
but previously they made up a bakery   
where villagers took their Sunday lunch
to be cooked.What is now a garage,used 
to be a public house called the "Horse 
Shoe" and a Cinema.A large Tannery has 
been taken over to become part of Mssrs
Barkers new shoe factory complex.It had
been the site of a tannery for hundreds
of years                               
                                       </content>
