 in 1378. Skreens Mansion was built    
 in 1445 and the owners were called    
 Skreyne. They owned a lot of the land 
 in Essex. John Skreyne died in 1471 26
 years of owning Skreens. Richard      
 Farmer was the owner of Skreens next  
 in 1452 but he was attained for high  
 treason and Skreens was given to HENRY
 VIII who gave it to Sir Richard Rich  
 who sub leased it to Richard Sampford 
 who had it for 3 years. Christopher   
 Allen owned Skreens until 1554 when it
 was granted to Richard Weston. Skreens
 was passed down the family of Westons 
 until it was sold to Sir John Bramston
 in 1635.
