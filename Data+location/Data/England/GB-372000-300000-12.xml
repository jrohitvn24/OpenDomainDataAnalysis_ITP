		<content>{Shopping.                             
   Some people buy their groceries at  
 Telford Town Centre or Bridgnorth.    
 Other people shop in Shifnal or       
 Madeley.  People without a car shop in
 Norton village or travel on the local 
 bus to Bridgnorth.                    
   When they get home from shopping,   
 people put the food in cupboards,     
 freezers and fridges, pantries or     
 cellars.                              
   For other kinds of shopping, such as
 clothes, they go to Telford Town      
 Centre, Bridgnorth, Shrewsbury,       
 Wolverhampton or Dudley.              
{Cleaning.                             
   We have electric hoovers, which pick
 up the dust on carpets and upholstery.
 We polish wood and metal surfaces.    
 There are many easy_clean surfaces in 
 our homes, especially in kitchens and 
 bathrooms.                            </content>
