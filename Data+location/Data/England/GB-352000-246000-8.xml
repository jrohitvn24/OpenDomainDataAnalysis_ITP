		<title>08Village Newsletter</title>
		<content>      Each month a 3/4 page newsletter 
 is distributed to every dwelling in   
 the Parish of Marden. It contains     
 news, views and listings of events    
 which have occurred or recurred in the
 last month and an almanac of forth    
 coming dates and venues.              
                                       
      Regular articles appear from the 
 village organisations and from        
 individuals. Often, controversial     
 matters are discussed and a cross     
 section of opinion is represented. The
 Religious groups submit items and the 
 Vicar's jottings appear each month.   
                                       
      The letter is community produced 
 with a few central gathering places   
 for the material to be included in    
 future editions. It is printed on the 
 School Roneo ink duplicating machine  
 and then delivered by volunteers.     </content>
