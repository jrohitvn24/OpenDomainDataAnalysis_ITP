		<content> There is a man in Raunds who makes    
 walking sticks out of cabbage         
 stems.These are very strong and look  
 wooden.He first brought the seeds from
 Jersey,thinking that they would grow  
 like an ordinary cabbage.However they 
 grew to between 10 &amp; 12 feet high.When
 it is this high it looks just like an 
 laburnam tree.The seeds are very small
 about 1mm square.He takes the leaves  
 off them to let the goodness grow in  
 the stem to have a thicker stick.In   
 his garden he also grows parana pears 
 and red &amp; yellow striped tomatoes &amp;   
 all his own fruits e.g.oranges,bananas
 &amp; grapefruit.He used to own a shop in 
 Raunds High Street for 54 years.He    
 also makes his own stencils.He also   
 owns the last hand-made brick made at 
 the old Raunds brickworks.
