		<title>13GIRL GUIDES IN BLAGDON</title>
		<content> I am a member of the guides and go    
 every Thursday from  7.30 until 9.00. 
 We have to pay a pound every month as 
 our 'subs'.                           
 Mrs Mainwaring is our Guider. We play 
 'bulldogs','broom game','caterpillar  
 race' etc. Our uniform is a blue skirt
 and shirt and a green scarf and blue  
 hat with a badge sewn on above the    
 left eye. We go to guides to serve the
 Queen and help other people.          
 We learn how to make camp fires when  
 we go trecking every other Thursday.  
 We have to collect dry wood and we    
 take food to cook. First we have to   
 ask the farmer for permission to go on
 his land. At the end of the evening we
 sing a song called 'Taps':-           
{   "DAY'S DONE,GONE THE SUN,FROM THE  
{SEA, FROM THE HILLS, FROM THE SKY. ALL
{IS WELL SAFELY REST, GOD IS NIGH."
