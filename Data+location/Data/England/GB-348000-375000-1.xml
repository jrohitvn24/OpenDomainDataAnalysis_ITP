		<content> This area is dominated by two tree    
 covered sandstone outcrops with       
 magnificent views over the Mersey     
 Estuary and surrounding land.The rest 
 of the area is largely covered by farm
 land and marshes.The block is cut into
 two by the M56 Motorway which has     
 dramatically reduced traffic and      
 congestion on the other main roads of 
 the area.There are two centres of     
 population,the market town of Frodsham
 and the village of Helsby.The market  
 takes place every Thursday and draws  
 people from all the surrounding       
 area.There are no major manufacturing 
 industries within the area and most   
 people travel out of the block to     
 work.Farm land forms a major part of  
 land cover with mixed farming being   
 the predominant type.The area is much 
 sort after for residential purposes   
 and is expanding rapidly.             </content>
