		<title>13JACOBS LADDER</title>
		<content> Around 1904 there was a man called    
{Ronald Pavey.}He invented his own     
 religion.He believed that all men were
 angels with parts of wings in their   
 backs.He also believed that to go to  
 heaven you had to grow your wings.He  
 had heard the story of Jacob going to 
 heaven up a long{ladder}so he built   
 his own out of concrete steps  up part
 of the cliffs.But he thought it was   
 not high enough so he built a tower.He
 then built a pair of wings and printed
 a picture of them on a postcard.He    
 then tried to fly by jumping off the  
 tower but he fell into the trees      
 because he survived he was sure all   
 men were angels.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
