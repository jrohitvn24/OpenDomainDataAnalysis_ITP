		<title>13The Boat Trip (continued).</title>
		<content>{May 22nd}At eleven o'clock,twelve of  
 us and Mrs.Dench went on a boat trip  
 around the island.There was a tractor 
 that towed a boat to the waters       
 edge.Six of us and Mrs.Dench went on  
 first.The boat took us out to a boat  
 called The Islander.Then the boat left
 us and went to get the others.We were 
 near the Landing Beach at that point. 
 When the others got into the boat we  
 started the engine.The driver was     
 called John Puddy.He is the           
 administrator. We went north past     
 Sugar Loaf and Ladies Beach and up    
 past the Quarry Beach where we saw the
 ship wrecked Kaaksburg.It crashed four
 years ago. Then the boat went by Gull 
 Rock where we saw some seals on rocks.
 We saw lots of Guillimots on rocks in 
 bunches of up to a hundred.Then       
 we saw a Puffin flying in a straight  
 line across the sea by Brazen Ward.   </content>
