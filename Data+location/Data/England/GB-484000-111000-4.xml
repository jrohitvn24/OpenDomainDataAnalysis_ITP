		<title>04West Dean Village</title>
		<content> During Saxon times,the village area   
 was owned by Earl Godwin,who was the  
 father of King Harold (famous for     
 1066).The village itself is small and 
 tranquil,it lies one to two miles from
 Singleton.The village incorporates    
 many quaint thatched cottages and many
 flint-built structures.The area today 
 is owned by the Duke of Richmond and  
 Gordon,who lives at Goodwood House.The
 village occupies an area of           
 approximately two square miles.West   
 Dean is not quite as large as         
 Singleton,but its population is almost
 the same.Being small,it lacks many    
 amenities,such as garages and large   
 shops.
