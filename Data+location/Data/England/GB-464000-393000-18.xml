		<title>18Farming around Bawtry</title>
		<content>  There is much arable farm land around
 the village of Austerfield and to the 
 North of Bawtry. The main crops grown 
 are the cereals barley and wheat.Some 
 sugar beet is grown and after         
 harvesting it is sent by lorry to     
 either Selby or Newark for processing.
 Oil seed rape is also grown but less  
 so this year than in previous years.  
 Peas are an important crop in this    
 area of lightish sandy soil.They must 
 be harvested in peak condition and    
 frozen within 6 hours. If this is not 
 possible they are transported to      
 Retford where they are dried. Potatoes
 are also grown to a limited extent.Few
 animals are kept although a small     
 flock of sheep was seen grazing close 
 by the River Idle.Several fields are  
 given over to the production of hay   
 which is used to feed ponies and      
 horses in the winter.                 </content>
