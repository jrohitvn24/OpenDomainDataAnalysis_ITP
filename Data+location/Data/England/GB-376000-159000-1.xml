		<content>   This area is approximately six miles
 from the Georgian city of Bath.It is a
 very rural area which includes the    
 picturesque villages of               
 Freshford,Limpley                     
 Stoke,Midford,Winsley and Monkton     
 Combe.Because of its proximity to Bath
 and the fact that the motorway system 
 is within ten miles,property in the   
 area is rather expensive.This has     
 resulted in many families of only one 
 or two generations living in the area.
    A disused railway line runs through
 the district.This was the route for   
 the Pines Express which went through  
 to Bournemouth.In the 1950's the film 
 'The Titfield Thunderbolt' was filmed 
 in Freshford.The Kennet and Avon      
 canal,now being restored for pleasure 
 craft,also passes through the area.
