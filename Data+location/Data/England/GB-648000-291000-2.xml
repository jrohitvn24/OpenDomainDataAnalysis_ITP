In activities week we went on a coach  
to Oulton Broad and went to people's   
doors and asked them questions from    
our questionaire sheets.On the Matters 
of Local Interest sheet we asked       
people in our area about local,British 
and world wide problems,we also asked  
if they knew of any local ghosts,food  
delicacies and customs. The Local      
Amenity Questionaire asked if people   
were happy  with the Educational       
arrangments,bus and train services     
,Entertainment,health and sports       
facilities. The BBC survey sheet asked 
about the persons life,hobbies,smoking 
and drinking habbits.                  
We also had a building count,children  
went out and counted the buildings and 
the different types of building.
