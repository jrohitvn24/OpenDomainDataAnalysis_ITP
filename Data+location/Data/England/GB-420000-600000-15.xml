		<title>15Acklington Lane &amp; Vill.Pumps</title>
		<content>{Green Lane}is a public lane which runs
 close to Acklington. It is very rutted
 in places, often muddy and certainly  
 not suitable for cars (although       
 farmers occasionally drive tractors   
 along it). It is thought to have been 
 a main thoroughfare in Roman times,   
 providing a link between the coast at 
 Druridge Bay and inland regions. Today
 it is used only by walkers and nature 
 lovers (and, of course, farmers).     
                                       
 In early Anglo-Saxon times, Acklington
 was almost certainly chosen as a      
 settlement because of the slightly    
 higher ground where the geological    
 circumstances favoured the finding of 
 springs. Today, 2{village pumps}still 
 catch the eye of visitors, though     
 sadly they are no longer in use. One  
 pump has a small roof over it "to keep
 the water dry" say the villagers.     </content>
