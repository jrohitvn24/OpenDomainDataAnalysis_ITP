		<content>    {Games}are part of our recreation. 
 We play games for fun. We are 10 years
 old.{Ariana}and older children like an
{indoor}guessing game called{detective.
 A detective is sent out whilst        
 somebody is chosen to be the suspect. 
 The suspect tries to escape from the  
 detective by moving. The others try   
 to protect the suspect by copying     
 every movement.Other indoor games     
 include hunting like hunt the thimble 
 and pencil games such as hangman.     
{Outdoor}games include skipping and    
 ball games.{Joanna}and younger        
 children like{Mr Gingle.}Every one    
 says " Goodmorning Mr Gingle" bow,    
 then ask what are you doing Mr Gingle?
 "Stirring my pot what do you think?"  
 You say things like a sock. He answers
 yes or no. When he says "A big fat    
 brownie",he tries to catch you. If you
 are caught you help him catch the rest</content>
