		<content>   The   Playgroup,  opened in  1970 is
 run  by a {committee of parents}and is
 affiliated    to    the   {Pre-School 
{Playgroups  Association. }The children
 aged between three and five are  cared
 for by  a  paid  supervisor and a rota
 Mum. A set activity follows free play,
 then lunch, a further play session and
 finally  story-time.  There are swings
 and  a  climbing  frame   available   
 outside. Equipment must be packed away
 after each twice-weekly session.      
                                       
   The{policy}by Worcestershire schools
{of  admitting   "rising  fives"} to   
 increase  their  numbers  has depleted
 the playgroup. Joining with the Mother
 and Toddler group  for one morning has
 doubled  the  number of children to 12
 but only six  attend  on  Fridays. The
{future}of this group{is in doubt.
