		<title>10Wool W.I. Golden Jubilee</title>
		<content> When Wool Women's Institute reached   
 its 50th anniversary, we held a Golden
 Fun Day for the whole village.        
 A children's pet show and a W.I.      
 Market started the day.A carnival     
 procession was the highlight of our   
 celebrations, led by Wareham Town Band
 and headed by the  W.I. "float"       
 entitled "50 Buzzy Years".This        
 depicted a flower garden, beehive and 
 swarm of 'bees' portrayed by W.I.     
 members.Other floats entered by Cub   
 Scouts, Brownies, Badminton Club,     
 Toddler's Club, Youth Club, etc, were 
 colourful and varied.The Recreation   
 Ground was filled with stalls,        
 sideshows, children's races and a     
 Mr Lovely Legs contest.An energetic   
 family Barn Dance ended the day in a  
 hall full of golden balloons and      
 flowers, and all agreed our Golden    
 Jubilee would be well_remembered.     </content>
