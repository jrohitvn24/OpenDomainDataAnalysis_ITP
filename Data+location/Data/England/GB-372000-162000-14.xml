		<title>14A TYPICAL SATURDAY IN BATH</title>
		<content> A typical day in my life is {Saturday}
 because I go down to town with my     
 sister to look in the shops and       
 sometimes to buy something. There is  
 an interesting and very big toy shop  
  called {Hamleys.}Then we go up to my 
 Nan's where we have dinner and        
 sometimes we go in the park. Back at  
 home I just play and watch            
 television. On some Saturdays I       
 participate in Saturday Sport at the  
 Bath Sports and Leisure Centre where  
 you can take part in Gymnastics,      
 Squash and Badminton.                 
   I often play with my best friends   
 but usually I play with my sister in  
 the back garden. Because I have got   
 some gymnastics rings in the back     
 garden I am able to practise          
 regularly.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
