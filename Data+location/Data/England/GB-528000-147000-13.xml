		<title>13    SOUTH NUTFIELD</title>
		<content>    {South Nutfield}is a very friendly 
 village ,it is quite small.There is a 
{Church School}in the centre, so we    
 don't have to walk a long way to      
 school. Just up the road,there is     
 a park  with{swings}and a{slide.}     
     In South Nutfield there are{six   
{shops, a{newsagent,a garage,a Post    
{Office,two grocers and a butchers.}   
     There is a{Village Hall,}a{railway
{station}and a{church}very near which  
 was built nearly a{hundred years ago. 
 It is surrounded by agricultural land,
 and there are lots of beautiful trees.
 Most of the houses have gardens, and  
 there is not much traffic.            
     We think{South Nutfield}is a nice 
 place to live in.
