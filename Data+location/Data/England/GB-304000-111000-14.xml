		<title>14LLOYD MAUNDERS MILL</title>
		<content>   Lloyd Maunders Mill Uffculme make   
 eight different types of chicken meal.
 They make food for their own company  
 and send it to the farms they own     
 within a thirty mile radius of        
 Uffculme. The firm began eighty years 
 ago when Lloyd Maunder met John       
 Sainsbury in London and decided to    
 raise cattle and sheep in Devon to    
 send to John Sainsbury for him to sell
 in his London shop.                   
   The mill in Uffculme was started a  
 few years ago when building permission
 was refused in Willand. The site was  
 originally a beatiful grist mill was  
 completely gutted in a fire in ????.  
 Sixteen peolple are now employed at   
 the Mill and Maunder's chicken are    
 sold to Sainsburys, Marks and Spencer 
 and Tesco. Uffculme has a good central
 position but the narrow local roads do
 cause problems for the lorries.       </content>
