		<title>09LANDMARKS IN LANGRISH (2)</title>
		<content> Langrish first came into existence in 
 the 1400s,when Bordean House was built
 by Roger Langrish. The Langrish family
 were on Cromwell's side during the    
 Civil War and afterwards moved to     
 Ireland where their descendants still 
 live. The village is famous for the   
 two Victoria Crosses won by villagers 
 during the First World War. The first 
 was won by Sergeant E.G.Horlock in    
 1915. Sadly, he was later killed on   
 service. The second was won by Admiral
 E.G. Robinson.                        
  There is only one public building in 
 Langrish-The Church.The residents of  
 Langrish want to convert part of it   
 into a Community Centre, and money has
 been raised by the book 'We Like      
 Langrish, Ramsdean too!' written and  
 edited by the residents of those two  
 villages.
