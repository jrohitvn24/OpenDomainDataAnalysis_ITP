		<title>12      A NEW RAILWAY ?</title>
		<content>   In the south western corner of the  
 Domesday block is a disused railway   
 line.The Grimsby Louth Railway        
 Preservation Society plan to open the 
 line again and run trains on it.They  
 hope that trains will begin running   
 again in Autumn 1986 when they open a 
 small section of line south of New    
 Waltham .When the railway does re-open
 it will be called the Great Northern  
 East Lincolnshire Railway.            
   On March 1st 1848 the Grimsby Louth 
 Railway line was opened and the first 
 trains ran.The company that ran the   
 trains was the Great Northern         
 Railway.People were able to travel    
 from Grimsby right through to London  
 and many stations in between.The line 
 was often used for speed tests because
 it was so straight.The line was closed
 to main traffic in 1976.
