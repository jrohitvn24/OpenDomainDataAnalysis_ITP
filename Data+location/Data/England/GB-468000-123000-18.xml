 cater for old female residents and    
 cancer patients. The residents pay a  
 fixed amount. The money for the cancer
 patients is raised in several ways:

   by the National Health Service.     
 2)The house has a registered charity  
   number, and a considerable amount is
   raised by several fund raising      
   activities such as fetes, sponsered 
   walks etc. and street collections.  
 3)The cancer patients, themselves,    
   normally contribute to the charity. 
   Also, some money is donated by      
   relatives of the deceased patients. 
                                       
 The residents have rooms to themselves
 which normally have running water.

 normally two or more to a room. They  
 all share a communal Dining Room.     </content>
