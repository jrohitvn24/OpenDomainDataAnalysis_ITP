 Bellingham is the major place of      
 activity in our block. In Bellingham  
 there are three council estates, but  
 only two are in our block, Westlands  
 and Fairshaw Crescent,which is the    
 older of the two.It was built in the  
 early 1950s by a local firm.          
 There are  between fifty and sixty    
 houses in Westlands making it the     
 biggest estate in Bellingham.Once a   
 tenant has lived on an estate for more
 than two years he is able to buy his  
 house,but before he buys it ,no major 
 alterations may be made.At regular    
 intervals of two/three years the      
 houses are painted and rewired.       
 Outside the main town of Bellingham   
 housing is on farms which are usually 
 privately owned.
