		<content> Fishing is popular in the village.    
 There are several rivers and the      
{Oxford Canal}nearby.  It costs Â£1.25  
 to join and there are four fishing    
 competitions a year.  They are for the
{Villagers' Cup, the Club Award and the
{Bert Alder Trophy.  The Christmas     
{Match}is sponsored and the money      
 raised is used for prizes.  Mr        
 Woodward times the matches.  We fish  
 for{pike, chub and dace}at Hog Bottom 
 on the{River Cherwell. }              
 Last year I won the Bert Alder Cup and
 this year I won the Villagers' Cup.   
 So far this year I have caught 2 chub,
 3 perch and 1 dace.  I keep a record  
 of all the fish I catch every year.   
 Five people in this school go fishing.
