<title>25Ryde Inshore Rescue in 2011</title>
<content>

Ryde Lifeguards are now known as Ryde Inshore Rescue, but they still cover the waters from Osborne Bay to St Helens, and they are still a voluntary organisation depending entirely upon donations and fundraising.&lt;br />&lt;br />They are on call 24 hours a day every day of the year. They now operate two lifeboats, one is a 6.3 metre RIB and the other is a 5 metre inflatable. The main lifeboat is named "Sir Norman Echlin Bt" and is only 3 years old. Its purchase was only possible after a huge fundraising effort, greatly assisted by local businesses, organizations &amp; individuals, which raised Â£50000 in under one year.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ryde Inshore Rescue is busier than ever; in 2009 it attended 83 incidents and rescued or assisted 271 people; in 2010, 51 incidents, 108 people rescued/assisted; and in just the first 7 months of 2011, 77 incidents, 188 people rescued/assisted.  &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
