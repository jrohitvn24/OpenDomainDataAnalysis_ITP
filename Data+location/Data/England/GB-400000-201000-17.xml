		<content> We have 13 churches in Cirencester    
 including Baptist, Church of England, 
 Roman Catholic and United Reformed.   
                                       
 The{Parish Church}in the Market Place 
 has a choir of 46 boys and men.One    
 choir boy said he liked being in the  
 choir because he made friends there.  
 His Mother suggested he joined as he  
 had a nice voice.The choirboys travel 
 all over England and have even sung in
 Westminster Abbey.                    
 Some children raised over Â£100 for the
{Church Bell Fund}by selling apples and
 eggs at school. The church had 12 new 
 bells this year which cost Â£75,000.   
                                       
 Mr Rice has been a curate at the      
 Parish Church for 3 years.He likes it 
 very much although he works long hours
 He has found Cirencester a friendly   
 place to live.                        </content>
