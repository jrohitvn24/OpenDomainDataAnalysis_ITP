		<title>04THE MEON VALLEY LINE</title>
		<content> This railway line opened in l903 as a 
 through line from Waterloo to Gosport 
 and Stokes Bay.  Closed in l955,      
 several features remain. From the     
 attractive Privett station (now a     
 private house) the line can be traced 
 through a deep cutting in the N/E,    
 invisible from the road. All the      
 Privett children know where, beyond   
 the thick bramble hedge, to find the  
 slope leading to the tunnel entrance -
 a magnificent brick archway hidden in 
 the cutting.  The tunnel runs beneath 
 the village for 1056 yards emerging in
 farmland in the south.From here the   
 line crossed the A272 on a road       
 tunnel, still a well-known landmark.  
 The inn opposite the Old Station      
 House, originally  the "Privett Bush",
 now the "Pig &amp; Whistle", was built to 
 serve rail passengers.The 5 cottages  
 nearby used to house railwaymen.      </content>
