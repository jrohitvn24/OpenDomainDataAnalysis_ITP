		<content>                                       
  The Shop is in the centre of the     
 village.  It is a house, with the     
 front downstairs room turned into a   
 shop.  It has a very small garden at  
 the front, with plants for sale in it.
  It is a very small shop, but the     
 owners manage to fit a lot in it.  It 
 has a Post Office counter, and a      
 counter for food.                     
  The shopkeepers get up at 0700, sort 
 out the shop, and the money for the   
 Post Office.  Then, they have         
 brekfast, and milk and bread are      
 delivered to be sold.  The Shop opens 
 to customers at 0845.  They check the 
 shelves, to see if they are out of    
 anything.  If they are, then they     
 order it from the warehouse.
