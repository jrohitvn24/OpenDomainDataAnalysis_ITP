 ago and he was born at{Low Fields.}His
 family have lived there 66 years and  
 they bought{Low Close}in 1961.The farm
 house Low Fields is 250 years old and 
 Low Close is 300 years old.           
 Yarrows own the farms. Low Close is 25
 hectares and Low Fields is 96         
 hectares. Their farm is mainly{arable.
 Yarrows don't employ any farm workers 
 but four brothers farm in partnership.
 They grow four{crops}which are barley,
 wheat, oats and hay and keep beef     
 cattle and hens. They stopped growing 
 potatoes in 1970  and went out of milk
 in 1973. They built a grain store, a  
 Dutch barn with a lean-to, an Atcost  
 building and a cattle shed. They have 
 twenty fields and grow mostly barley  
 and they have taken 5 hedges out in   
 the last five years because they used 
 to be small fields.                   </content>
