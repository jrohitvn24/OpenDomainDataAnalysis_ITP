		<title>15CRAFT FAIR AT HODDESDONBURY</title>
		<content> It was a fine sunny Sunday on the 8th 
 Sept. l985 when the 3rd Hoddesdon     
 Craft Fair was held in the 2 barns and
 large garden of Home Farm, Hoddesdon- 
 bury. Local craftsmen and women       
 demonstrated and displayed their      
 talents &amp; visitors were able to buy   
 many items. General handicrafts,      
 needlework, crochet &amp; knitting were on
 sale, also pottery &amp; paintings.       
 Beautiful leather bags &amp; belts were   
 available as folk watched the leather-
 worker at work. Other crafts          
 demonstrated were basket weaving,     
 rug weaving, copper etchings &amp;        
 jewellery making. A wood turner and   
 renovator of furniture had several    
 pieces on display. Customers were     
 fascinated to watch a spinning wheel  
 in use &amp; a lady making fragrant       
 pomanders. The organisers were        
 delighted with the Fair's success.    </content>
