		<content> There is a distinct division of our   
area into the U.S.A.F.Base at R.A.F.   
Mildenhall in the South and the local  
villages and farms in the North.No such
division exists between the two        
communities.Our American visitors are  
welcomed and they contribute much to   
our society,not only in terms of       
co-operation and cultural exchanges but
also in employment for local residents 
and many long lasting friendships      
between families. This happy           
relationship has been confirmed during 
our researches for the Domesday Project
and we are very grateful to the R.A.F. 
and U.S.A.F.Commanders,the Base        
Historian,Officers,civilians and       
families of R.A.F.Mildenhall.Our thanks
also for the help and welcome we have  
received from local residents, and to  
the 1985 Fifth Year children and their 
parents who have collected information.</content>
