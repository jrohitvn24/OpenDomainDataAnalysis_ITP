		<title>19Computers in Education</title>
		<content> In 1985, every school in Cockermouth, 
 infant through to secondary, had at   
 least one microcomputer.  Initially   
 provided through a 50% grant from the 
 D.T.I., many schools have bought      
 further computers and peripherals     
 (disc drives, printers etc.) from     
 their own funds or with help from     
 parents and local charitable          
 organisations. Computers are used in a
 variety of ways, including C A L      
 (Computer Assisted Learning), word    
 processing and computer studies for   
 examinations at secondary schools.    
 Schools are obtaining software from   
 commercial and educational sources.   
 The M.E.P.(Micro-electronics Education
 Programme) (Government funded) has    
 been helpful to schools.  The Local   
 Education Authority has advisory staff
 and seconded teachers who assist      
 schools to use computers in education.</content>
