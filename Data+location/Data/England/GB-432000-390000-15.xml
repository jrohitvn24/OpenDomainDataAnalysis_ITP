		<title>15HILLSBOROUGH PARK</title>
		<content>   Hillsborough Park opens at 8.00am &amp; 
 closes at 9.00pm. There are lots of   
 things to do. There are tennis courts 
 and fields for games and picnics when 
 it's fine. Younger children use the   
 playground which has swings, slides,  
 roundabouts and climbing frames. We   
 feed the ducks &amp; go fishing in the    
 pond. You can't go fishing there over 
 16. There is a bowling green where    
 pensioners go to pass the time. Near  
 the library is an arena with a running
 track where some schools hold their   
 sports days. There is a large carpark.
  In the summer they hold the Sheffield
 Show here. The Sheffield Marathon     
 starts and finishes here too. Later in
 the year there are fairs. Hillsborough
 Park is a very pleasant place to be on
 a summers day.
