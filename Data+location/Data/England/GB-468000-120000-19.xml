		<title>19BUTSER HILL</title>
		<content> The steep slopes of Butser Hill,(270ms
 high)are a distinctive local feature. 
 One of the chalk hills of the South   
 Downs escarpment,on its flat top are a
 wireless station,a beacon &amp; a triangu-
 lation point as well as facilities for
 the Country Park &amp; some Neolithic ear-
 thworks.The hill is let for grazing to
 a local farmer,who keeps rare cattle &amp;
 sheep here. The Country Park has a car
 park just below the summit(cost 40p),a
 round building designed to resemble an
 Iron Age hut which houses a small cafe
 &amp; souvenir shop &amp; toilets,&amp; a number  
 of waymarked foot &amp; bridle paths.The  
 beacon is used to signal important    
 national events;one has been here for 
 hundreds of years.On the northern     
 slopes is an Iron Age farm run as a   
 research project.This is getting      
 yields that are as high as those of   
 the local'agribusiness'farmers.       </content>
