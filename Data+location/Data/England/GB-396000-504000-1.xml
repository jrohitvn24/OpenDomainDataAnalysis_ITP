		<content> This high dales valley cuts diagonally
 from NW to SE through high heather    
 moor land. Above Low Faggergill the   
 valley is wide, wet, rough grassland, 
 used for grazing sheep. Below, the    
 valley contains many small fields of  
 grass used for both sheep and cows.   
 People live in small isolated         
 farmhouses. As there is no shortage of
 stone, field walls and houses all have
 thick walls.  Whaw is the only        
 community in the block and is a hamlet
 of 8 to 10 homes including 2 farms.   
 Homes are mainly occupied by local    
 farm workers, although some have been 
 renovated and are used as holiday     
 homes. The valley has lots of         
 footpaths which are regularly used by 
 holiday makers and day visitors.
