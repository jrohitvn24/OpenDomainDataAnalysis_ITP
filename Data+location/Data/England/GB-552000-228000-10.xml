 Pimblett who has owned it for 52 years
 Mr.J.Pimblett wanted to own a Farm    
 because it had run in his family.     
 3 or 4 people work on his farm .The   
 crops which are grown are Wheat,Barley
 and Oats .The best is wheat and 350   
 acres of it are grown The farm has 540
 acres in all The machinery kept on the
 farm is 9 Tractors,8 ploughs 1        
 Combine Harvester worth Â£38,000.      
 The stubble is burnt after harvesting 
 so that you can carry on sowing the   
 crops .It would be very difficult if  
 the stubble is not burnt.Stubble      
 burning annoys many people.The most   
 interesting thing about owning the    
 farm was the harvestig and the least  
 interesting thing is sitting in the   
 office.The busiest times of the year  
 are September and August.             </content>
