		<title>19Barkestone landscape</title>
		<content> The local landscape is quite          
 hilly.There are woods nearby which    
 belong to the Duke or Rutland.The     
 three villages of Redmile Plungar and 
 Barkestone all have farms so there are
 a lot of fields which grow crops or   
 are for grazing.The ground is quite   
 high and from Barkestone near the     
 church you can see Newark on a clear  
 day.Light aircraft fron nearby Langar 
 can often be seen as people like to   
 parachute from them.The canal runs    
 through all three villages and is     
 quite clean.A railway used to run     
 through the villages too but the track
 has been taken up since it is no      
 longer used.People like to come from  
 the towns to stay or visit our        
 villages as they are very             
 attractive.The villages are small and 
 the roads are also narrow.
