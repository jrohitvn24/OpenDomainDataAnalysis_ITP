		<title>02OLD &amp; YOUNG: WHAT WE DO</title>
		<content> We went to Somerset Court in Cheveley 
 where old people live, and talked to  
 Mrs Allard about what she does on a   
 normal day. She firstly has breakfast,
 then does her housework and then      
 spends her day visitingfriends to help
 them out. At 4.30pm she often goes    
 shopping, then goes back to her house 
 to have dinner. On some nights she    
 goes to the community room for bingo  
 and a cup of tea. On Tuesday night, it
 is bingo in the village hall, on      
 Wednesday she attends 'Evergreens', an
 old peoples club, and on Thursday it's
 bingo again.                          
 I (Mark Paxton), have breakfast and go
 to school. At 3.30pm I go home, get   
 changed and go out to play, or do any 
 homework I have. At 6pm I have my     
 dinner. Afterwards I spend until 8pm  
 playing with my friends. I then have  
 my tea, and go to bed.                </content>
