		<title>13The School.</title>
		<content>  The  P.T.A.  raise a lot of money for
 the  school  and  we  help  by doing a
 sponsored  obstacle   every  year.  We
 decorate  the  school when our parents
 have parties like the Medieval Banquet
 or  the   Mad   Hatter's   Party.   At
 Christmas we  give  a  concert for our
 mums and dads.                        
  We  had  an open day and invited some
 of the old people to school. They told
 us what school was like years ago.    
  Some  children have school dinners at
 Â£3.50  a  week  but most children have
 packed  lunches.  The  school  dinners
 come from Midsomer Norton in  a school
 meals  van.  It  also brings the meals
 for the old people  twice  a week. The
 kitchen at Midsomer Norton is going to
 close  at  Christmas and we might have
 frozen   dinners.   I  like  going  to
 Beckington  school   and   so   do  my
 friends.                              </content>
