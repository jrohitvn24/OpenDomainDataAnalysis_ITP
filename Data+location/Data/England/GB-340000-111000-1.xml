		<title>01Hinton St George and Area</title>
		<content>  There are not very many facilities in
 Hinton. There is a recreation ground, 
 a pub, a postoffice, a bus service, a 
 church and a village hall. People     
 mainly travel outside the village to  
 go to work because there's not much   
 work in Hinton. The shop is a family  
 business as well as the Post Office   
 and the pub only employs a few people.
 There is one farm in the village      
 called Browns' Farm. There is a good  
 education and small classes in the    
 village school. Small schools care    
 about you and we care for each other. 
 People don't pollute the countryside  
 by dropping litter. There's no        
 vandalism in Hinton because everybody 
 knows everybody and someone will soon 
 find out. Around Hinton is beautiful  
 open countryside with fields, woods,  
 animals and footpaths. People take    
 care of Hinton St George.             </content>
