		<title>19ARMED FORCES-KEEVIL AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> This year there has been much concern 
 about the rumoured change of use of   
 Keevil airfield. The Ministry of      
 Defence has withdrawn public access   
 with the exception of the Gliding Club
 and Model Aircraft Club at weekends,  
 and the annual motor cycle rally and  
 PHAB club sponsored walk. The dispen- 
 sation of grazing rights on the air-  
 field has been withdrawn and seasonal 
 licences will be issued to farmers.   
 Rumours of the arrival of cruise      
 missiles, with the added hazard of    
 'Greenham Common' problems, have been 
 quashed in a letter from the MOD Land 
 Agent to the Parish Council, which was
 published in the Parish News. RAF     
 Lyneham continues to use the airfield 
 as a parachute dropping zone for their
 Hercules transport aircraft.It is also
 used for helicopter and army exercises
 - all to a greater extent than before.</content>
