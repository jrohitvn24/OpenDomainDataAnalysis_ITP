		<title>04ECOLOGY OF FRILSHAM (2)</title>
		<content> As this part of Berkshire is quiet and
 relatively unspoiled there is{plant   
 and{animal life}in abundance. Many    
 foxes and badgers are here. Colonies  
 of rabbits are now breeding rapidly   
 again resistant to myxymatosis. Also  
 there are many small animals such as  
 moles and weasels. Deer too, like     
 rabbits damage farm crops. There are  
 many birds in the field hedges. Herons
 can be seen on the Pang and the       
 nightingale can still be heard. The   
 north of Frilsham is bounded by the M4
 motorway and the banks on each side of
 it are now a new area of{conservation.
 Up above birds such as hawks and      
 plovers ignore the traffic and breed  
 here.{Rare flowers}such as cowslips   
 grow here where men do not tread.     
 There is much{deciduous woodland.}Fine
 beech trees were planted in the 19th  
 century for timber as well as beauty. </content>
