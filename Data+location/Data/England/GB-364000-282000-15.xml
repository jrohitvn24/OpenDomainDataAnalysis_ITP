		<content>  {Pre-school children}can go to  a    
 Playgroup at Chorley.                 
  {4 1/2 to 11 year olds}attend the    
 village school in Stottesdon.         
  {11 to 16 year olds}go to Lacon      
 Childe school, Cleobury Mortimer.     
                                       
   In 1984{Stottesdon School}was       
 threatened with closure with 22 pupils
 on roll. Parents, staff, parish       
 councillors &amp; most residents opposed  
 closure, &amp; a campaign followed to     
 persuade county councillors and       
{Shropshire Education Department       
 officials to reconsider. There        
 were several meetings about this &amp; in 
 the end we managed to persuade them   
 that numbers would reach the required 
 level of 30 within 5 years, &amp; that    
 travelling time to any other school   
 would be unacceptably long.
