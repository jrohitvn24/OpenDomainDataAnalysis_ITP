		<title>17Interviewing Mr/Mrs.Fielder</title>
		<content> We went to Mr.&amp; Mrs. Fielder's        
 house on 14th July 1985 to interview  
 them. They have lived in Lavant over  
 82 years. They had to leave school at 
 the age of 14. The job that Mr.Fielder
 had to do first was for Mr.&amp; Mrs.     
 Denman in their house. Then he worked 
 in a factory then did gardening. Mrs. 
 Fielder worked for the Lowes as a     
 Nanny. We asked them if they had      
 noticed any changes in Lavant. They   
 said lots of cottages have gone and   
 there is not so much farmland. Before 
 cars, horses &amp; carts took people up to
 Goodwood. Roads changed from stones to
 tarmac. They said life is better now  
 than it was years ago. Mr.Fielder went
 to Lavant School and his Headmaster   
 was Mr.Young, but his wife didn't. He 
 said they were very strict. They often
 got the cane for talking.
