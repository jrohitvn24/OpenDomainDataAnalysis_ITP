		<title>02MY FIRST DAY IN SETTLE</title>
		<content> When I heard I was to come to England 
 I was excited. I could not keep still.
 Before I came to England I lived in   
 Germany. When we arrived in Hellifield
 I was very excited because I had not  
 seen my cousin for four years. And you
 can imagine how excited  I was. When I
 visited Settle Middle School on a     
 Monday morning I was nervous.When  I  
 started school the class were going to
 Malham. Living here is quite nice     
 except for times when I fall out with 
 Abigail. There are a few places I have
 not yet explored. When I get home from
 school I walk up and down Haw Hill    
 which keeps me fit. But when I get up 
 at 7.00am I want to stay in bed.
