		<content>          The area is covered by two   
 differing types of policing. The north
 and east are covered by foot and      
 vehicle patrols from a central police 
 station twenty-four hours a day. The  
 rest of the area has two "community   
 policemen" who provide cover for up to
 sixteen hours a day. When they are not
 working police cover is by way of     
 vehicle patrols from the central      
 police station. "Community policemen" 
 walk the same area all the time while 
 the police from the main station work 
 a different area every few days.
