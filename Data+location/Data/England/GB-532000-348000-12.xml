 Sibsey Free School has 79 childen.    
 The first school was built in{1723.}  
 All the childen who are poor did not  
 go to school when it was first built. 
 When they grew up they did not get a  
 job because they did not go to        
 school.                               
 So when Sibsey Free School opened in  
 1869 everyone went to it because it   
 was free. Sibsey school has one       
 staffroom and one canteen one school  
 house, two toilets and one office. For
 dinner most childen bring sandwiches  
 and some go home for dinner.
