		<title>15SECONDARY EDUCATION</title>
		<content> Secondary education is different in   
 the two villages. In Sheepscombe there
 is still selection for schools in     
 Stroud. Stroud Girls High School and  
 Marling School take the girls and boys
 who are of Grammar school standard and
 Archway school is a non selective     
 comprehensive. Various schemes for the
 introduction of comprehensive         
 education for all have ben suggested  
 over the years but have not been      
 introduced. The children in the       
 Cranham parish can attend Brockworth  
 Comp. School but some parents opt out 
 and send their children to private    
 schools in the Cheltenham area.       
  Further Education is available at    
 Stroud, Gloucester and Cheltenham.
