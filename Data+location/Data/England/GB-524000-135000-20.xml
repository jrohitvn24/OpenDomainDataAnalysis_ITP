		<content> THIS BLOCK WAS SURVEYED BY THE JOINT  
 EFFORTS OF THE CHILDREN AND THEIR     
 TEACHERS IN EIGHT LOCAL SCHOOLS. IT   
 WAS A MAJOR TASK TO SUCCESSFULLY      
 CONCLUDE THIS AT A TIME WHEN SCHOOLS  
 WERE DISRUPTED BY BAD WEATHER,        
 TEACHERS IN DISPUTE WITH EMPLOYERS AND
 A CHANGE TO A SYSTEM OF MIDDLE SCHOOLS
 IN THIS PART OF CRAWLEY.              
 SCHOOLS INVOLVED WERE:                
  {*}HOLY TRINITY (SECONDARY)          
  {*}HOLY CROSS INTERMEDIATE (MIDDLE)  
  {*}BEWBUSH (MIDDLE)                  
  {*}SOUTHGATE WEST (MIDDLE)           
  {*}LANGLEY GREEN (JUNIOR)            
  {*}IFIELD (JUNIOR)                   
  {*}GOSSOPS GREEN (JUNIOR)            
  {*}ST. FRANCIS (FIRST)               
 Many individuals in and out of schools
 deserve special thanks.
