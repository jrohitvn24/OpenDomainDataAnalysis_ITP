The valley of the River Nene is rich   
in gravel which is needed to supply the
building industry in Northamptonshire  
and the surrounding counties. Gravel   
has been extracted in small amounts for
generations but with the increased     
needs for gravel and the use of much   
larger machines to extract the gravel  
there has been considerable controversy
over the further extraction of large   
quantities in the Nene Valley below    
Great Doddington. The main concern has 
been the noise and dust caused by the  
extraction and the resultant large     
expanses of water that have left. Some 
of the land will be restored to        
agricultural use whereas other areas   
will be used for leisure. There is     
still considerable opposition in the   
Parishes of Wollaston and Great        
Doddington to further gravel extraction</content>
