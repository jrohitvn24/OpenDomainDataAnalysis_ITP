		<title>20Northill Village Tea Room</title>
		<content> In the Spring of 1984, a number of    
 local housewives, concerned about the 
 closure of village amenities, started 
 a fortnightly{TEA ROOM}in the Village 
 Hall.  Its aim was, and is, to provide
 a focal point for villagers to meet in
 a relaxed and informal setting.       
 Tea and home-made cakes are the usual 
 fare, and gradually, stall-holders    
 selling stationery, produce, crafts &amp; 
 bread have come along, which, together
 with a raffle, create an interesting  
 afternoon.                            
 Support for the TEA ROOM has been     
 enthusiastic, and the organisers won  
 the 1984{'VILLAGE VENTURES'}          
 competition run by the Bedfordshire   
 Rural Community Council.              
 This is a non-profit making initiative
 which has become a regular feature of 
 village life.
