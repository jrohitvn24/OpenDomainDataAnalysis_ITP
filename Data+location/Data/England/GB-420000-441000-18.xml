		<title>18TRAFFIC CENSUS</title>
		<content>  Our school is next to{Leeds and      
{Bradford Airport.}Most of the other   
 land around the school is farm-land.  
 There are 6 farms and there is a new  
 Garden Centre near the junction of    
 Dean Lane and Otley old road.Our      
 school is not on a bus route but      
 the country lanes are very busy with  
 traffic.                              
 We have to be very careful when we    
 walk up to the airport,which is the   
 nearest bus stop.                     
 Last Friday we did a traffic census to
 find out how many vehicles went past  
 our school in half an hour.           
 I counted 46 cars.                    
 Leslie counted 12 lorries and vans.   
 Samantha counted 1 motor cycle.       
 Wendy counted 8 taxis.                
 Craig counted 1 Landrover and 1       
 tractor.We counted a{total of 69      
{vehicles in 30 minutes.By Sharon Smith</content>
