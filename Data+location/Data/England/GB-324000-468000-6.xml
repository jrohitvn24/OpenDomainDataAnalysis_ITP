		<content> The east side of block 0324 0468      
 adjoins Morecambe Bay and is popular  
 in the summer with day visitors from  
 Barrow and Ulverston who find the area
 quiet and relaxed with pleasant views 
 across Morecambe Bay.The area is not  
 at all commercialised but there are   
 two caravan sites at Newbiggin which  
 cater for local people and for        
 visitors from further afield.The      
 caravan sites provide basic amenities 
 such as toilets and running water and 
 little else apart from a childrens'   
 adventure playground.The sea is used  
 for bathing but at low tide the sea is
 represented by a narrow channel nearly
 2 k.m's from the coast and even at    
 high tide the water is quite          
 shallow.The coast is served by a good 
 main "A" road with a two hourly 'bus  
 service between Barrow and Ulverston.
