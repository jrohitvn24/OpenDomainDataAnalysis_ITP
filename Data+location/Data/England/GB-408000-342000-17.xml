		<content>In the village of Ellastone there are  
Dancing classes and Badminton at the   
village hall. A dance is held once a   
month and there is a village pub. It   
was agreed that they are more things   
than 10 years ago. The new things being
planned are a bowling green,a tennis   
court and a new Car Park.              
 We asked if there were any clubs that 
children could join.There was a Sunday 
school,which only 10 children belong.  
 We were told that the older richer    
people who were moving into the village
didn't tend to join in the local       
events, except the retired farmers.    
Certainly people who came from cities  
didn't appear to be very interested in 
village activities.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
