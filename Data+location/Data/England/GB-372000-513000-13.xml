		<title>13Leisure time activities</title>
		<content> We have been finding out what         
 activities people from our school and 
 village do in their spare time and how
 long they do them for.When we started 
 our project we had to record the      
 answers that people gave us and what  
 we were going to ask them. We found   
 out that the most popular activity    
 was watching television.25 children   
 watched it for 298 hours in one       
 week.We asked eleven parents how long 
 they watched television for.The       
 results were 201 hours.Reading was    
 second most popular with 82 hours for 
 children and 51 hours for adults.We   
 also found out that a lot of sewing   
 was done in a week.
