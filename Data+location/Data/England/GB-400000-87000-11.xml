		<title>11The Church and its people</title>
		<content> In 1854 there were 300 parishioners   
 and few visitors. In 1985 there are 30
 parishioners and thousands of         
 visitors.                             
 The congregation consists mainly of   
 islanders and the church can seat     
 approximately 85. On average about 5  
 or 6 attend together with some        
 visitors. The Scouts and Guides make  
 visits to the island and in June 1985 
 Lady Baden-Powell visited it to       
 celebrate 75 years of Guides.         
{Renovations.}The people contribute to 
 the church fund which at present is   
 funding the renovation of the church  
 roof because the ornamental pins which
 hold the roof up are rusting away.    
 After 34 years of being closed to the 
 public the National Trust bought the  
 island and in 1963 re-opened it. Since
 then the church has enjoyed more      
 recognition and many visitors.        </content>
