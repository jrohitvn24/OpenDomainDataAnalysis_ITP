		<title>05COPLEY HILL FACTORY FARMING</title>
		<content>   In 1965 as well as arable farming   
 COPLEY HILL also introduced battery   
 farming for egg production. This runs 
 at a loss, due to competition in      
 Europe and E.E.C. regulations,and the 
 batteries are soon to close down.     
   The farm has 18,000 hens, although  
 in 1975 it had 110,000. At present,   
 12,000 eggs are produced daily. Eggs  
 are sent to a packing station at Soham
 near Ely, to be graded from 1 to 6    
 according to size. The average price  
 received for the eggs in 1985 is 42p a
 dozen.                                
  2 breeds of chicken are used, Warren 
 and Ross Brown. Chickens are kept for 
 1 year egg laying and are then sold   
 for meat. Each battery contains up to 
 6,000 hens, kept at the same          
 temperature throughout the year.      
 Despite mechanisation, the eggs are   
 still collected by hand.              </content>
