		<title>02Farming in the area</title>
		<content>Until the Second World War,this well   
watered pasture land was used mainly   
for rearing cattle and sheep.Most farms
kept a few dairy cows.Root crops were  
grown for livestock and only a few     
acres of cereals were grown.Since the  
war there have been two fundamental    
changes,more cereal has been grown and 
the use of powerful tractors and       
machines,resulting in less labour.     
Today the majority of the fields in the
area grow wheat or barley.There are a  
few new crops to break the cereal      
rotation,such as oil seed rape.        
There are four dairy farms in the area 
which grow mainly leys (cultivated     
grass not permanent pasture) for       
grazing and silage making.Most farms   
keep some sheep and beef cattle.A      
few pigs are kept and bred too.These   
animals are bought and sold at the     
market in nearby Banbury.              </content>
