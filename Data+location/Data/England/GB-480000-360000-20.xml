		<title>20Churches in Collingham</title>
		<content> There are 4 places of worship in      
 Collingham;the Church of{St.John the  
{Baptist }in South Collingham dating   
 from the 12th century,the Church of{  
{All Saints }in North Collingham dating
 from the 13th century,the{Baptist }   
 Chapel which was founded in 1662 and  
 the{Methodist }Church on the High St. 
 which was built in 1855.              
 That Collingham is able to support{   
{four churches }is commendable by      
 todays standards.But during the week  
 there are guilds,choir practices and  
 fellowships.The churches are linked   
 through{Collingham Christian Council }
 which is exploring the possibilities  
 of joining together in worship and    
 working together in outreach.         
 The work for this survey was          
 undertaken by the children and        
 teachers of John Blow Primary School  
 and groups of adults from the village.</content>
