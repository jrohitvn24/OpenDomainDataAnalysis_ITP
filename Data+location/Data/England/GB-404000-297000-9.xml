		<title>09Dishwashers or Washing up</title>
		<content> There are only{3 people}in Mr. Walsh's
 class of 28{that have got dishwashers.
 Everybody else washes their dishes by 
 hand. The people with dishwashers just
 open a kind of door and put the dishes
 in and the dishes are washed and come 
 out nice and clean. In 20 years time, 
 everybody may have dish washers apart 
 from some people that cant afford it. 
 Not many people have them because they
 are too expensive to buy. A long time 
 ago people had to wash their clothes  
 by hand but now nearly everybody has  
 got washing machines. So the same will
 probably happen with dish washers. In 
 our house nobody likes washing up. We 
 all argue on Sunday, when it takes us 
 half an hour to wash up, because      
 nobody likes it.{by Jonathan Berry,
