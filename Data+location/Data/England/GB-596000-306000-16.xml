		<content>{CHAIRMAN OF THE PARISH COUNCIL }We    
 discussed some of the problems in the 
 village.  Street lights needed new    
 switches and would  each cost Â£25     
 to repair.  The council also had to   
 contact other organisations about road
 repairs, pot holes had been the most  
 recent problem.  Conservation of      
 footpaths was an important issue.  The
 Council usually have monthly meetings.
 Some problems get passed onto{        
{Breckland District Council.}The       
 Chairman preferred to has meetings    
 with people rather than telephone or  
 write.  Sometimes meetings could take 
 4 hours.{A COACH PROPRIETOR}told us   
 that he started work at 6.30a.m. and  
 finished often at 7.00p.m.  He drove  
 on average 1000 miles per week.  Paper
 work was part of the job that he      
 disliked but repairs to the coaches   
 was his favourite job.                </content>
