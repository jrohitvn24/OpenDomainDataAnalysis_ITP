 Empingham has a large church with a   
 fine crocketed spire atop a tower and 
 dates back to the 13th century.  The  
 present incumbent is also part time   
 prison chaplain to the nearby Stocken 
 Hall and lives in a modern rectory.   
 The main Sunday service is the Parish 
 Eucharist using Rite B in the ASB.    
 There are some 30 to 40 regular       
 communicants going up to over 100 on  
 festival occasions. At Christmas,     
 harvest,Easter, there are joint       
 services with the Methodist Chapel.   
 The Chapel is part of the Stamford    
 Circuit and has a small but hard      
 working congregation who also run a   
 number of activities for young people 
 including a holiday club.             
 Roman Catholics in the area have to go
 to Exton or Oakham.                   
 Whitwell has a small church.          </content>
