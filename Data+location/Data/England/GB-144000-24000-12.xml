		<content>    {Mousehole}has a number of clubs   
 which serve some of the community's   
 recreational needs.  There are the    
{Girl's Life Brigade}and the{Boy's     
{Brigade}which are both affiliated to  
{St. Clements Methodist Chapel}to cater
 for the younger age groups.           
     For the older age group there is a
{British Legion Club}which provides for
 games such as billiards, snooker,     
 darts and cards to be played.  The    
 British Legion Hall was built in 1929 
 after the foundations had been dug out
 by the local men and women, with the  
 actual money for the building coming  
 from ex-servicemen.                   
     There has always been a very      
 active women's section which was      
 formed to raise money for{Legion      
{ Charities}such as Rest Homes, Widows 
 and Orphans and Rehabilitation        
 Centres.                              </content>
