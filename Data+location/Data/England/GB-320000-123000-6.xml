		<content> County cricket is an important part of
 Somerset life particularly in Taunton.
 The largest crowd at the County Ground
 is about 11,000 and the club has about
 6,000 members, but this has decreased 
 slightly over the last year.          
 There are 115 full time employees,22  
 of them players. The manager ,Mr.Tony 
 Brown,said that the average earnings  
 of players for six months was Â£7,500  
 plus any money for endorsing sports   
 goods.The club itself relied heavily  
 on sponsors to keep it running.       
 Because of the Bradford disaster the  
 old pavilion has been closed and will 
 be replaced when money is available   
 together with more permanent seating. 
 In 1985 our most famous players are   
 Ian Botham,Viv Richards and Joel      
 Garner.
