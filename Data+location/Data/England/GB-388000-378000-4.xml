		<title>04MOTTRAM HALL HOTEL</title>
		<content>   Mottram Hall was built by the Booth 
 family in 1721. Today it is a Hotel   
 owned by De Vere Hotels. Over the     
 years it has grown bigger and today it
 has 72 bedrooms. Conferences and      
 meetings take place at the Hotel. A   
 twin room costs Â£58.00 per night. The 
 Hotel has beautiful grounds and even a
 helicopter landing pad which guests   
 can use. Soon the Hotel is having a   
 Leisure Complex with a swimming pool, 
 squash courts and sunbeds. Many stars 
 from sport and entertainment come and 
 stay, the England Cricket team stay   
 while they play Test Matches at Old   
 Trafford, Manchester. About 70 people 
 are employed there. One of the        
 residents the guests would not like to
 meet is the ghost - the ghost is a    
 lady dressed in blue with a crucifix  
 in her hand.
