		<title>17A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MY MUM</title>
		<content> My mum gets up,puts on her dressing   
 gown and goes downstairs. She goes    
 into the kitchen,makes breakfast and  
 prepares our sandwiches.  After       
 breakfast she washes up and cleans the
 kitchen.  She stands by the door nd   
 waves goodbye to my dad,my older      
 sister and myself.  She then gets the 
 vacuum cleaner out and cleans the     
 house. After she has cleaned she gets 
 ready to meet her friends to play     
 badminton.  After her game she goes to
 the shops and gets the shopping.  When
 she returns home she puts everything  
 away and goes and sits down.  Later   
 she makes dinner, welcomes us home,   
 and after the meal has been eaten and 
 the kitchen cleaned she goes to the   
 lounge to watch television until it is
 time for bed.
