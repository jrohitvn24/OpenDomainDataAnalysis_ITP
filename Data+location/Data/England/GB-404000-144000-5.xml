		<content> Some signs of coming rain are:        
  Moles throw up larger hills.         
  Sheep rise early to graze.           
  Elderly cats behave like kittens.    
  Spiders wait at the entrance to their
    webs.                              
  Rooks feed close to their rookeries. 
 Some Traditional Cures:               
  For Warts: Cover with a cobweb which 
   is afterwards burnt, or rub with a  
   piece of raw steak, and bury it     
   secretly in the ground.  The wart   
   would then disappear as the steak   
   rotted.                             
  For Cramp: Put corks under the pillow
   or tie them round the affected limb.
  Marjoram oil: Soothed toothache,     
   relieved earache, and marjoram tea  
   helped keep infection from the chest
   and lungs.                          
  The Nettle was another "cure all" for
   glandular trouble and gout.         </content>
