		<content>  The flat fields between the A39 road 
 and the river form the flood plain of 
 the Tresillian River. Rosehill Cottage
 gardens are full of flowers and       
 vegetables because of the warm        
 sheltered land and the damp, fertile  
 soil. By the old toll road are some   
 huge ash trees. They were growing so  
 tall because it is sheltered and the  
 trees do not get bent or blown down as
 in many parts of Cornwall. Some of the
 flood plain meadows are cut for       
 silage, others are full of weeds and  
 old cars, but the last two are        
 cultivated for a market garden.       
  On the right of the toll road the    
 land slopes steeply upwards. Much of  
 this is grassland but some is scrub.  
 Down the valley at Cuskayne corner the
 County Council dumped tons of earth   
 because the A39 is cracking. When it  
 has settled a new road will be made.  </content>
