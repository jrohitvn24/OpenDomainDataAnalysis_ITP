		<content>   One farm near Satterthwaite has sold
 many of its fields to neighbouring    
 farmers, and now concentrates on      
{intensive egg farming}with battery    
 hens. They have about 3000 hens in    
 two buildings. The hens produce about 
 13700 eggs each week in the summer    
 months. They are fed on mash which    
 is constantly available, and they     
 can always get a drink from a         
 small nozzle on a pipe which runs     
 the whole length of the cages.        
 Most local people buy their eggs      
 there as they are always lovely       
 and fresh. All the eggs which are     
 left over are taken to                
 supermarkets and greengrocers in      
 the Furness area. Eggs are also       
 supplied to the Ormandy Hotel at      
 Grizedale.
