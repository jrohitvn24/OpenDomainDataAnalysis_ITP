		<title>10All Saints' Church, Wytham</title>
		<content> The church of All Saints,dating back  
 to Norman times was rebuilt in 1811,  
 using some of the original stonework. 
 The windows and the arches are Early  
 English work. The date (16  ) on the  
 gate, does not refer to the church.   
 The parish is about 10 miles long. The
 parishioners mainly come from Wytham  
 village. There is one service on a    
 Sunday, and Sunday school for the     
 children. During the week, there is   
 Mothers' Meeting and choir practice.  
 The Harvest Festival is the most      
 well-attended service. On Mothering   
 Sunday the children bring posies of   
 flowers to the church for their       
 mothers. Last year there were 3       
 christenings and one funeral, but no  
 weddings. About 20% of the villagers  
 attend church each week. All Saints'  
 Church with its quietly caring vicar  
 suits this rural parish.              </content>
