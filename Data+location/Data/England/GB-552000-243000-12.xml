		<title>12Yews Farm</title>
		<content>    Yews Farm contains 335 acres, plus 
 4 acres of pasture that was used for  
 pigs, and 2\ acres of wood.  Some     
 fields were called "leys"; one field  
 was called a rough ley.  The farmer,  
 Mr Crawley, thinks that this is       
 because the field was very bumpy or   
 because it had bushes growing on it.  
    The farm has no animals except the 
 1000 geese he orders each year.  They 
 nest, then Mr Crawley collects the    
 eggs.  He eats some himself and sells 
 the others.  The geese eat the grass  
 in the field.  Then he gets rid of the
 geese.  Unfortunately it was too late 
 this year to order any so he is going 
 to borrow a small flock of about 50   
 sheep to graze in his small field.  It
 has long grass in it and is an awkward
 shape so he can't use machinery.      
    There was an orchard of apples and 
 pears near the farmhouse.             </content>
