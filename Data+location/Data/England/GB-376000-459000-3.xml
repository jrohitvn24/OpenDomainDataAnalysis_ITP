		<title>03Farming in Rathmell N.W.</title>
		<content>    Because of the uneven nature of the
 ground and the often inclement        
 weather, animal rearing is the major  
 farming activity. Cows and sheep may  
 be seen,the latter especially on the  
 higher and rougher pasture to the     
 west,where they roam freely for much  
 of the year.                          
    Mechanization is directed to       
 improving the grassland and harvesting
 the crop. At harvest time tractors and
 trailers to and fro between field and 
 farm throughout the hours of daylight 
 (or beyond!) taking advantage of a dry
 spell in the weather.There has been a 
 move away from haymaking to cutting   
 the grass for silage. Once cut, the   
 grass is collected green and stored,  
 often under black plastic sheeting.   
 It rots down and is used as winter    
 feed. It gives a rather different     
 scent to the country air!             </content>
