		<title>11THE DENTIST(CONT)</title>
		<content> The surgery has to be very,clean.     
 The uniform is optional,some dentists 
 prefer to wear normal clothes,some    
 people are afraid of the white        
 uniform.Mr.Holdsworth feels that      
 dentists are here to stay,{how will   
{bad teeth be pulled in the future?}He 
 does see some changes{e.g.LASERS may  
{be used to help the dentists;}as well 
 as some form of injection being       
 developed to get around the problem of
 hard bone under the gum.{At the moment
{there are some problems about how     
{dentists can be paid for their work in
{the  N.H.S.}Mr.Holdsworth does not    
 always work at his own dental         
 surgery.He visits certain hospitals   
 which provide dental treatment.These  
 are in Leeds.He goes to further his   
 own experience.                       
  There are 2 other dentists in the    
 practice,and 3 assistants.            </content>
