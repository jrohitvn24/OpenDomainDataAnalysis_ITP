		<content>{Computers}are  worrying and helping   
 many people.They are seen as a threat 
 to jobs and as a way of taking control
 of our lives.Yet they are helping     
 disabled people and making many jobs  
 easier.                               
 We are also concerned about           
{peace.}People say we have had forty   
 years of peace but in many places     
 people are fighting.                  
 Another concern is the number of      
 people out of work.We are worried that
 in a few years time we may be the ones
 out of work.There are somewhere       
 between three and four million people 
{unemployed.                           
{Drugs}are a growing problem with      
 teenagers and adults.Heroin and       
 Canabis are two of the drugs most     
 often taken ,they can often kill or   
 make you very ill.
