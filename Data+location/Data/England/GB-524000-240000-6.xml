		<content> The cows file into the parlour where  
 the udders are carefully wiped with   
 individual tissues. A little of the   
 milk is examined before milking starts
 properly. When milking is finished    
 the teats automatically disconnect.   
 The milk used to be taken round the   
 village and sold. The herd was        
 tuberculin tested but the milk was not
 pasteurised. As sales dropped this was
 not considered profitable. Milk is    
 still sold by Bluegates dairy but it  
 comes from a Cambridgeshire Dairy.    
 Milk is warmer than human blood it is 
 stored in the large refrigerated      
 stainless steel containers, collected 
 by tanker and taken to Letchworth five
 miles away to be bottled and sold.    
  Pasteurisation is now economical on a
 small scale so it is possible that    
 Ashwell will again drink its own milk.
