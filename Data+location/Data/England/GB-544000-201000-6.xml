		<title>06EPPING'S RAIL LINK</title>
		<content> The{Epping to Ongar Central Line      
 opened in 1880,is under-used and under
 threat. Over 1,000 people use the line
 going south, but a mere 30% of that   
 number use the Epping-Ongar line.     
 However this section of line is       
 important to a small number of people.
 It costs{Â£230,000}a year to run this  
 line and more money and passengers are
 needed.Although trains leave Epping   
 every 12 minutes,apart from the rush  
 hour,many are almost empty.           
{Complaints}have been made to the      
 L.R.T.about breakdowns.The Central    
 line Users Group has complained that  
 warnings about cancellations have not 
 been advertised.Use of travel cards   
 and increased parking facilities are  
 helping to encourage more passengers. 
 Epping's commuters see the threat of  
 closure as the beginning of the end of
 the line_{they will fight!            </content>
