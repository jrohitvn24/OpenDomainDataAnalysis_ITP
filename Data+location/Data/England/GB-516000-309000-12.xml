		<content>     They raise money for any charity  
 that needs help.The most money that   
 was raised was Â£1105.It was raised at 
 Christmas time.That money went to     
 charity.They do any service that will 
 help people.They take children to     
 places for short holidays.If there is 
 a big event they start to plan about a
 year before the actual thing.         
     At Christmas time the Lions go    
 round the streets with a life size    
 papier mache reindeer to raise money. 
 They give lollies to the smaller child
 -ren when they put money into the     
 collecting tubs.Apart from Rudolf     
 there are other Christmas characters  
 like Snowmen and Santa Claus.They have
 music coming out of a couple of speak-
 ers which are in the sleigh, which is 
 towed by a car with Rudolf on the     
 roof.The generater is disguised as a  
 chimney.                              </content>
