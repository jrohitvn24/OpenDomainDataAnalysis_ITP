		<content> There are no schools in the area      
 covered. Children attending State     
 schools and living over two miles from
 them are transported by bus. Mixed-sex
 primary schools for ages five to      
 eleven are at Kirdford, Fittleworth   
 and Wisborough Green. From eleven to  
 sixteen, and eighteen if studying for 
 entry to colleges or universities,    
 children attend big comprehensive     
 schools such as the Weald School,     
 Billinghurst, which caters for about  
 1,500, brought from all parts of the  
 County by coaches. These schools have 
 their own computer centres and cover a
 wide variety of subjects. The school's
 facilities are used by the local      
 community after school hours. Children
 attending private, fee-paying schools 
 may be day pupils or boarders, either 
 weekly or for a term. These schools   
 are usually for one sex only.         </content>
