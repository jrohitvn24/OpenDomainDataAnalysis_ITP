		<content> At low tide the land that is exposed  
 is vegetated saltmarsh and mudflats.  
 Just off the coast is Pewit Island    
 which is also Ministry of Defence     
 property.  The Property Services      
 Agency which administers all Ministry 
 property holds a Possessory Title to  
 this land, having acquired it by Act  
 of Ownership in 1885.  There is no    
 evidence of Pewit ever having been    
 inhabited by anything except birds.
