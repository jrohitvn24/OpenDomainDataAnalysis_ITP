All corn grown fed to animals.         
 Old Victorian farmhouse sold and      
present farm owners &amp; families live in 
house and bungalow nearby.             
 Damerons owned farm in 16th century   
but emigrated to New World. In 1930's  
owner of Damerons Farm, Rectory Farm &amp; 
 ewland Hall employed over 30 men;only 
 6 or 8 were employed at Damerons Farm.
1980's - Farming not so hard physically
because of machinery but just as hard  
competitively. Machinery makes it      
possibe for just 2 men to run the farm.
