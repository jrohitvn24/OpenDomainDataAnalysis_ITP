		<title>10Farming - Pigs</title>
		<content> The pig farm is well away from the    
 village for obvious reasons.          
    Mr.Bell rears the pigs in special  
 buildings called units.He breads the  
 pigs himself and has about 85 piglets 
 each week.He feeds them a compound    
 feed which is mainly barley and fish  
 meal.He raises them acording to weight
 for bacon and pork.He sends out each  
 Friday to the abattior.               
    He employs another person but he   
 has to work very hard himself,usually 
 about twelve a day.He feeds all the   
 stock before breakfast and then does  
 general work and maintenance.         
    He does,infact,have some cattle and
 sheep sa well as making hay and       
 silage.Farming can be a tricky busin- 
 ess and it is better to have different
 market outlets rather than relying on 
 pigs alone.
