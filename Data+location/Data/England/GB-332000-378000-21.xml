I moved to Morland Avenue in 1947 when the local Council built new houses there.  There was a field opposite, now the site of Raeburn School, where the children of the street used to play.  We went to Heygarth Primary School at the top of Heygarth Road or to Woodslea School.&amp;#13;&amp;#10;&amp;#13;&amp;#10;I remember two Cooper boys, one of whom, I think, was called Dennis.  He offered me a ride on a horse they kept at the field.  Morland Avenue  was a wonderful place to live in those days.  As well as the field opposite where we joined in the haymaking there was open land behind two sides of the field where we wandered and played until it got dark.  There was a pond where we fished for tiddlers and an old barn belonging to Knockaloe Community Centre that we turned into a den.   &amp;#13;&amp;#10;&amp;#13;&amp;#10;&amp;#13;&amp;#10;   &lt;br />
