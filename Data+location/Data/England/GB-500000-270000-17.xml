THE DISUSED METHODIST CHAPEL was built 
in 1870 and demolished in 1969. It was 
closed down through lack of people to  
support it. The last preacher to preach
there was a MR. BULKREY. Now the land  
where it stood is covered with grass   
and brambles, which weave themselves   
into the last remains. These remains   
consist of the concrete base, some old 
wire and some of the corrugated iron   
sheets from the roof.                  
THE HARGRAVE BRICKWORKS were built in  
1898 and after periods of extension and
demolition, they were finally closed   
in 1975. They were started by MR.      
MAKER, which was an appropriate name   
for him. The works made about 20,000   
bricks each year. The land is now used 
for farming and for shooting game and  
vermin. The ruins of the works can     
still be seen.                         </content>
