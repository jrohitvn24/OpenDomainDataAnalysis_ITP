		<title>03VILLAGE OF KEMPSFORD</title>
		<content>{ Kempsford}is basically ribbon        
 development along its main street and 
 the west end falls within this survey.
 Older development around the church   
 and 19th century development alongside
 the old canal's quay and a modern     
 estate are outside this survey which  
 includes the village hall, primary    
 school and an old inn, The Axe and    
 Compass (owned by Messrs Courage), the
 entrance of which is much below       
 present road level. Houses are stone  
 with slate roofs, with tiled modern   
 houses and bungalows of reconstituted 
{Cotswold}stone infilling. There are   
 only two red-brick buildings amidst   
 the mellow{Cotswold}colouring.        
  There are two farms, a builders yard 
 and a haulage contractors.            
 Approximately 40% work locally or are 
 retired whilst the others commute.
