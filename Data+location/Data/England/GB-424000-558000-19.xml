		<title>19LOCAL SHOPPING SURVEY</title>
		<content> We did a shopping survey in{Sheriff   
{Hill.}We found that there was no major
 shopping centre in this square. All   
 the shops are small mainly family     
 businesses. The shops are in several  
 main types:-                          
 a) Shops selling goods to people -    
 these sell ordinary things that people
 need every day -there are 10 of these 
 shops including 6 grocers.            
 b) shops selling services - these     
 provide personal services which people
 need, such as hairdressing. There are 
 only 4 of these including one video   
 hire shop.                            
 c) Fast food shops - there is 1 fish  
 and chip shop and one Chinese take-   
 away shop.                            
 d) There are centres of entertainment 
 - 4 public houses and a gymnasium.    
 e) Ther are also businesses - there is
 a scrapyard and a builders yard.      </content>
