		<content> Ditchingham has been in existence     
 sincethe first Domesday.There is evi- 
 dence of occupation in the Bronze Age.
 The Romans grew fruit on the south    
 facing slopes of the Vineyard Hills by
 the River Waveney.A spring below these
 hills resulted in a spa in the l73Os. 
 Today Ditchingham is a growing lively 
 village but no industry or fame. New  
 housing estate names recall past resi-
 dents of note: Lewis Close for a much-
 loved parson of the l96Os;Rider Hag-  
 ard Way for the Victorian author and  
 agriculturist.The church has screen   
 porch &amp; window restored as a memorial 
 to him.The village of l985 is l/4 mile
 away from its earlier site. In l96l a 
 Parish Newsletter was begun.With diary
 activity reports, church service times
 and articles of local and general in- 
 terest it links residents in a vital  
 way in these days of village decline. </content>
