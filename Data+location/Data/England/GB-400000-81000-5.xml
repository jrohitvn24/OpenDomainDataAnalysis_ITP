		<title>05STUDLAND TOURIST SURVEY</title>
		<content>   Children walked the length of       
 Studland Beach interviewing the       
 visitors.Most were from the Midlands  
 or the home counties.Only 10 were on  
 their first visit, having heard of the
 place from friends or guidebooks.Only 
 4 of the 40 people approached were    
 staying in the village.The rest were  
 day-trippers,staying in Swanage or    
 other resorts.All approved of the     
 quietness, the sandy beach, safe      
 bathing, pretty village,scenic walks  
 and lack of commercialisation.        
 Most regarded carparking provision as 
 good, amusements arcades and litter as
 undesirable and the local people as   
 friendly and helpful.Gardens for "just
 sitting" were a good idea for some,but
 not more tea-rooms.Most thought prices
 in the village compared favourably    
 with other resorts. {Over-all the     
{tourists we spoke to seemed satisfied.</content>
