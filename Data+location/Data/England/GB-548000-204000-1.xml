		<content> North Weald Bassett parish covers     
 4.042 acres.The village is surrounded 
 by farmland used for growing crops    
 and the rearing of animals. On the    
 eastern boundary is the old airfield  
 which is mainly used for storage or   
 weekend events such as airshows.The   
 radio station is run by British       
 Telecom but will soon be "moth balled"
 for emergency use only.There are      
 nurseries growing salad crops and a   
 fish farm.There is a development of   
 light industrial units manufacturing  
 fencing,gates and stairs as well as   
 storing equipment.Most North          
 Weald people work in surrounding towns
 although some use the underground     
 railway and travel into London.The    
 village is growing and two large new  
 estates are being built which has     
 necessitated the building of a new    
 sewage works in Church Lane.          </content>
