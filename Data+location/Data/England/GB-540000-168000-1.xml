		<title>01The Bromley Area.</title>
		<content>"Bromley"is derived from the Anglo-    
Saxon name BROM LEAGE.One of the       
Bishops of Rochester granted the market
charter which resulted in the early    
growth of Bromley.In the 19th century, 
Bromley was a staging post for coaches 
from London to Hastings.               
The Borough includes many villages,    
such as Chislehurst and Bickley,which  
retain an individual character.        
The coming of the railway stimulated   
growth to a large town.Wealthy         
buisness men found the area amendable  
and the rail link efficient.Some local 
industry exists today,but most         
residents commute to London to work,   
are involved in service industries or  
work in locally based commerce.Bromley 
has good recreational facilities.There 
are parks and woodlands;it has a       
theatre and cinema,and concert halls   
and sporting facilities are close by.  </content>
