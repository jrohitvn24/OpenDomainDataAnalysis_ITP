		<title>03Florence Nightingale</title>
		<content> Florence Nightingale was born on May  
 12th, 1820 at Florence in Italy. She  
 died in 1910 at the age of 90. Her    
 mother's name was Fanny, her father's 
 William and her sister's Parthenope.  
    In the summer Florence lived at{Lea
{Hurst, Holloway, Nr. Matlock,         
{Derbyshire}where her father paid for  
 the local school. For the rest of the 
 year Florence lived at Embley, near   
 London.                               
    Then in 1842 she felt she wanted   
 to help the poor and sick.Her parents 
 did not like this idea though in 1851 
 she entered a convent hospital in     
 Germany. From here she studied in     
 London. In 1856 a public fund         
 collected Â£50.00 for Florence which   
 she used to set up a Nightingale      
 training school for nurses at Saint   
 Thomas's Hospital.
