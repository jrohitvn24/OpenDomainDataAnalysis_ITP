		<title>18Rose Queen.</title>
		<content>    It is now five weeks since I was   
 chosen to be{ROSE QUEEN}for{St. Mary's
{church.}As a{Rose Queen}I have a year 
 to raise money for the{church}and     
{Sunday School}and then a year as the  
 retiring queen.                       
    In six days I am to be{crowned.}   
 There will be several speeches,       
 including my own, in the ceremony.    
 There is a stage for the Queens, and  
 nearby are stalls selling food,       
 drinks, and handicrafts.              
    One money-raising event I have     
 thought of is a{past queens}night     
 which involves inviting as many       
 ex-queens as we can. As there have    
 been Rose Queens for many years we    
 should be able to find a lot of them.
