		<title>04EAST MOOR FARM</title>
		<content> Access to East Moor Farm is gained by 
 the Ashington to Ellington road. It is
 owned by the N.C.B but leased to Alcan
 Farms. The farm was built between 1835
 to 1850. The office and cottages were 
 built in 1938 and the grain dryer was 
 built in 1974. In 1976 the farm       
 cottages were modernised. It is a farm
 roughly 340 acres in size. 16 people  
 live on the farm but only 4 employees 
 live and work on it. East Moor was    
 origionally a dairy farm supplying    
 most of the milk to the area, but     
 these dairy buildings and barns have  
 now been converted and adapted to     
 grain storage. East Moor has a rare   
 building amongst it's many barns,it is
 a horse gin or gingan which is a      
 circular barn activated by a horse on 
 a pole which turned the big stone     
 grinders for grinding the corn, but   
 now it is a tractor shed.             </content>
