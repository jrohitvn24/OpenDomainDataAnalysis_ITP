		<title>16Boughton Village</title>
		<content>{     Boughton,}like its neighbour     
 Ollerton, has developed in two main   
 stages. The{old village}dates back to 
 at least the 16th. century, and the   
{newer houses}have been built mainly   
 since 1960 to house employees of the  
 N.C.B.                                
                                       
      Boughton village is a neat       
 traditional English village complete  
 with Church (St. Matthews,built in    
 1868),Village Hall, Green,Manor House 
 (now used as a{convent_St.Joseph's)   
 and three public houses.              
                                       
      The rest of Boughton consists of 
 newer houses built in three estates   
 and mostly owned by Newark District   
 Council.                              
      There is also a considerable     
 amount of{farmland,}mainly used for   
 winter cereal crops.                  </content>
