		<title>13FARMING - OWERSBY - ARABLE</title>
		<content> The largest and most intensive arable 
 farm in the area covers 2,200 acres   
 including about a quarter of the block
 The biggest field is 207 acres, the   
 smallest less than 1.It is worked by  
 8 men and a foreman using 11 tractors 
 ranging from 75hp-230hp - very useful 
 machines to clear the roads as comm-  
 unity service in snowy weather.This   
 year about 450 acres of oilseed rape, 
 1200 acres of wheat and 400 acres of  
 barley were grown, and harvested by 4 
 MF760 combine harvesters,the men work-
 ing up to 15 hours a day,7 days a week
 The crops are sprayed an average of 5 
 times within the year (twice with a   
 herbicide,twice with a fungicide and  
 once with an insecticide) using half- 
 tracks with 52ft boom sprays.Aerial   
 spraying has been abandoned as being  
 less cost effective.
