		<content> Croughton is a long thin 'ribbon'     
 village which developed along what is 
 now the B4031.  This was an ancient   
 'green lane', a drove road, and       
 turnpike.  It was part of the old     
 coaching route from Banbury to        
 Winslow.  It is still part of an      
 East/West route for drivers avoiding  
 motorways, and consequently there is a
 high level of traffic through the     
 village, increased to some extent by  
 traffic for RAF Croughton.  On Sundays
 the level is high as a very popular   
 Sunday Market is held at Finmere, and 
 when Grand Prix are held at           
 Silverstone, there is an enormous     
 increase.                             
                                       
 Car Parking is a problem in the       
 village centre, as the old cottages   
 have little space or provision for    
 garages.                              </content>
