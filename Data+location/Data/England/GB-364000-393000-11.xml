		<title>11Risley Remand Centre</title>
		<content>    Risley Remand Centre became a      
 prison in 1965. During the Second     
 World War it was used as a Royal Navy 
 Base.                                 
    Risley was chosen as the site for  
 the remand centre, because it occupied
 a central position between two major  
 cities, Manchester and Liverpool,     
 where a great deal of crime took      
 place.                                
    In the Remand Centre there are at  
 least 550 cells with two people per   
 cell. The prisoners get up at about   
 7.45am each morning, but if they are  
 going to court, they get up at about  
 6.15am.                               
    Most of the prisoners choose to    
 sleep or read during the day. The food
 they get is porridge or cereal in the 
 morning, bacon and chips in the       
 afternoon and sausage and chips for   
 tea.                                  </content>
