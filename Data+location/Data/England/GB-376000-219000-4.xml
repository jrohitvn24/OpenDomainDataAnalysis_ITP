		<content>   Since 1945,farmers have been pumping
 the soil full of chemicals in a bid to
 inprove yields.Experts and the public 
 are both worried about the state of   
 the country's soil and quality of the 
 food we eat.                          
   In this climate of concern local    
 businessman Mr. David Wilkin has set  
 up a company to market natural        
 fertilisers to replace damaging       
 chemicals -"{CUMULUS ORGANICS}"- of   
 Two-Mile lane Highnam was set up early
 in 1985.At present the turnover is    
 Â£1000 per month.Products include      
 liquid organic fertilisers and soil   
 conditoiners.                         
   Such products should improve damaged
 soil,prevent further damage and       
 benefit the quality of food supply-   
 all 3 being praise-worthy endeavours.
