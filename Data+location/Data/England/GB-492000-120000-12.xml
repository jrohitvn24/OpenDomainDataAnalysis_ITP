 the Rother between  Halfway Bridge and
 Selham, is  the  business  address  of
{James Morley &amp; Sons Ltd.}and{ W.L.West
{&amp; Sons Ltd.  } Mr. West introduced our
 class to  Mr.Challen who had worked in
 the timber yard for 45 years.         
           {TIMBER MERCHANTS           
         {FENCING  CONTRACTORS         
{  MANUFACTURERS OF CHESTNUT  FENCING  
 We saw piles and piles of sawn timber,
 seasoning in the yard  or just waiting
 to be made into{gates}or{fences. }Huge
 trucks carried whole treetrunks.   Mr.
 Challen took us to his workshop  where
 he assembled the  20 yard  lengths  of
{chestnut fencing; } Beverley found the
 count  of  1,1,2,3, working  the  wire
 machine,  a  bit  confusing.     Carla
 thought  her dad  looked strange  with
 ear-defenders  but  Mr.Enticknap still
 waved to us all as we left the yard.  </content>
