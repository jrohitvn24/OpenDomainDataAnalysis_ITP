		<title>03ELMSTEAD HALL,ELMSTEAD.</title>
		<content>   Elmstead Hall dates back to the{15th
{century.}The present owners have lived
 at Elmstead Hall for 66 years.There is
 a{Great Hall}in the middle downstairs,
 it has a big fire place and a large   
 mahogany table.There is a wooden floor
 now,as the brick floor was too cold.  
 There are 17 sash windows on the front
 with three{dummy windows}which have   
 been blocked up with slate and then   
 painted on,this was due to window tax.
   In the house there are 17 rooms ,all
 very big. The bedrooms have sloping   
 floors.No one has ever seen a ghost at
 Elmstead Hall.The house does not      
 belong to the people who live there,  
 but belongs to{Jesus College,Cambridge
 who bought it in 1934.It is a{listed  
{building.}That means that it can not  
 be altered on the outside but the     
 occuppant can do what he likes to     
 the inside.                           </content>
