		<title>02EARTHWORKS, HARROW.</title>
		<content>   Stretching for 25 miles from Windsor
 to Potters Bar is an earthworks called
{Grim's Dyke.}A section of this can be 
 seen at Saddlers Mead in Hatch End.   
   Dates for the building of this      
 feature range from 500 B.C. It was    
 probably built by{Saxon}tribes,       
 perhaps the Catuvellauni tribe, as a  
 defence line with a wooden fence or   
 palisade on the top and a ditch filled
 with water behind it.                 
   It is mentioned as{Divels Dyke}in   
 the Domesday Book when it was being   
 used as an animal enclosure.          
   Today, it has fallen away and is    
 only 4 metres high at its highest     
 point. It looks like a long bank with 
 trees along it.                       
  {Grim}was probably another name for  
{Woden,}the Saxon god of thunder.      
 Others think that{Grim}means{goblin}or
{devil.}                               </content>
