 front playground above the middle     
 window there is a crest.The crest     
 represents the Huyshe family.At one   
 time there was a stove near the main  
 door but it isn't there anymore.The   
 school is made of stone from Kilerton 
 quarry.The scool has had one fire,that
 was caused by the stove.When that     
 happened people came running from far 
 around to put the fire out.There has  
 been 1330 children at the school from
