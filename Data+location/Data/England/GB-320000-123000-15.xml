		<content> We are eleven and in our last week at 
 primary school.Today our class visited
 the comprehensive school we will go to
 in September.It is called the Castle  
 School.                               
   At 8.55 we met in the main hall,    
 feeling very nervous.We were told     
 which houses we were in.After going to
 our form room for registration we were
 shown around the school.It is about   
 four times as big as the one we go to 
 now and holds 900 children.Instead of 
 one teacher we will have a different  
 teacher for each subject and a        
 different classroom for each lesson.We
 saw slides and science experiments and
 we had to say "please" and "thank you"
 in French before we had a drink and   
 biscuit.At lunchtime we could choose  
 our own meal in the cafeteria.Later we
 had a discussion in our form_room.By  
 the end of the day we felt reassured. </content>
