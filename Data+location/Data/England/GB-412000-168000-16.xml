		<title>16May Day in Wiltshire.</title>
		<content> On May Day Monday everyone had a      
 holiday. It was warm and sunny. In the
 afternoon at 2 o'clock there was a    
 footall match and a netball match. The
 boys' football team beat the mums'    
 team 3 goals to 0. The girls' netball 
 team beat the dads' team 5 goals to 4.
 The matches were played just for fun. 
 The dads had to play in wellingtons.  
 They were much taller than the girls. 
 Some of the mums had bruised legs and 
 blistered feet afterwards.            
 When the games were over, everyone    
 went back to the school. You could buy
 refreshments_canned drinks, orange    
 squash, crisps and sweets. There was a
 raffle competition, too. The PTA      
 raised Â£26 to help buy things for the 
 school.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
