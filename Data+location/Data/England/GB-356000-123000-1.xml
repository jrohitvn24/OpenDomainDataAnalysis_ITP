		<title>01INTRODUCTION-CAMELS' AREA</title>
		<content>    The area of our study lies in a    
 wide clay vale with a limestone ridge 
 rising in the north. The River Cam    
 runs at the foot of the ridge while   
 the A303 runs along the top. The river
 has trees along it's banks many of    
 which are in the process of being     
 cleared. There are two villages, West 
 Camel and Queen Camel where the older 
 houses are built of local stone. The  
 hamlet of Bridgehampton lies on the   
 western border adjoining the airfield 
 of R.N.A.S. Yeovilton. Farming is the 
 main industry in our area. This is    
 mainly cattle, but there are some     
 sheep and there is both a large pig   
 farm and a chicken farm. Very little  
 land is planted for crops, but a few  
 fields are planted with rape seed or  
 wheat. In summer there is a great     
 volume of traffic on its way to the   
 S.W. coastal resorts.                 </content>
