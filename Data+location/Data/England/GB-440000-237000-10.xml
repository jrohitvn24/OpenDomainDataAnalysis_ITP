		<title>10Ellsborough Herd :Banbury</title>
		<content>{Ells Farm} has been in the family for 
70 years. They have got a {Fresian     
herd} because they are a good and      
strong breed. They breed their own     
replacements and they have two bulls.  
They have had a {pedigree} for four    
years. This means that they have kept  
records of their cows for ten years.   
For the first six years they record the
details  of the calves and their       
behaviour. Then they hand it in to the 
Fresian Society and if the book is good
they get a pedigree. If they sell the  
cows then they can look in the book and
tell them about each animal. They take 
the cows to market after 8 years when  
they stop milking but they have one    
that is 21 years old at the moment.    
They start milking at 06.00 and then   
again at 16.00. They give about 30     
litres a day and there are {60 cows} in
the herd.               Claire Upton   </content>
