		<content>  Our area block is comprised of the   
 old village of North Hykeham and the  
 village of South Hykeham.             
   North hykehm as a whole is now a    
 town with a population of about 1200. 
 Although our survey only covers a     
 small part of North Hykeham.          
  South Hykeham was once more important
 as a village but now it is not. The   
 reason for this could be that North   
 Hykeham is situated nearer to Lincoln 
 and also that it has better road and  
 rail links to other towns so allowing 
 industry to grow.                     
  Most of our area however is taken up 
 by agriculture and residential use    
 and no industrial sites. {HYKEHAM}is a
 flourishing town and has its own      
 library, youth centre, shopping and   
 sports complex as well as a health    
 centre.
