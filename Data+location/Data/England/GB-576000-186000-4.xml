		<title>04Geography of Sth Benfleet.</title>
		<content> The plateau and the hills surrounding 
 South Benfleet are made up of young   
 rocks,a mixture of clay,sand or       
 gravel,which is only about 38 million 
 years old.Under the heavy London clay 
 in the lower lying land there is chalk
 which is almost twice as old:about 65 
 to 70 million years.Springs,at the    
 junction of London clay,sands and     
 gravel gave South Benfleet is own     
 excellent water supply.It now receives
 water from the Hanningfield reservoir 
 and the pumping stations opposite the 
 South Benfleet Primary School and the 
 Water Tower on top of Essex Way have  
 become redundant.They are Victorian   
 red-brick buildings;one is now a      
 church for the Christian Fellowship   
 and the Water Tower a Radio Station   
 for Essex Radio.The Water Tower is    
 also a distinctive landmark which can 
 be seen for miles across the country. </content>
