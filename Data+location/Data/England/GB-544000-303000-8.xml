		<title>08Friday Bridge Water Tower</title>
		<content> The water tower is in the middle of   
 the village. It is used as a landmark 
 for the land and air. It can be seen  
 for miles and aeroplanes use it on    
 training flights. It was built in 1884
 for the outlying parishes of Wisbech  
 and the Great Eastern Railway at      
 March. The water tower is 112 feet    
 high and has three floors. The water  
 comes from Marham by gravity. At the  
 side of the water tower is a big      
 reservoir which contains a million    
 gallons of water. The tank at the top 
 of the water tower contains 100,000   
 gallons of water. The water got to the
 tower by pump and supplies the        
 surrounding area. In 1981 a facelift  
 was carried out at the cost of        
 Â£10,000 to the water board. The       
 tower's diesel booster pumps have been
 replaced with electronic ones to the  
 north west of the tower.              </content>
