		<title>12WADDINGTON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>   There is an industrial estate off   
 the main Grantham Road. There are     
 a sign maker, a timber supplier, a    
 camping and outdoor shop, an insurance
 broker, and two servicing garages.    
 One of the garages also deals with    
 second-hand Japanese motor bike       
 accessories.                          
   One of the garages has two          
 employees, who would both like a pay  
 rise. The best part of their day is   
 relaxing in their tea break after     
 working too hard.                     
   Both garages only service cars      
 and do M.O.T. but do occasionally buy 
 a car which has failed its M.O.T. The 
 owners needed around Â£2000 to start   
 their businesses. They do not want to 
 move their garages because they have  
 enough work locally, but people do    
 come to them from outside Waddington.
