		<content>The Sue Ryder Home was opened in May   
1979. The home is a place where people 
go when they are ill. Many of them are 
cancer patients. Right now in the home 
there are 34 nurses working day and    
night shifts and there are 19 patients 
in the home now but they can hold 23.  
They have 44 rooms in the home.The     
house was originally built in 1903 by  
Robert Fleming whose son Ian wrote     
James Bond books. Houses have been     
standing for a long time in the same   
place as Joyce Grove is now.Every year 
Joyce Grove has a Pony Grand National  
in the grounds. The little children do 
it. They train every week and they have
alot of other events to keep the home  
going.
