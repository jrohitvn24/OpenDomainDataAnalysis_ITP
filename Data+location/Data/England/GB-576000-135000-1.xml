of Kent 15 miles south of Maidstone.The
town is situated in the valley of the  
Crane brook.It is surrounded by belts  
of mixed woodland and open farmland.The
oldest part of the town,with its       
variety of weatherboard,tiled,and      
timber framed buildings,is located on  
either side of the high street and     
stone street.No mention is found in the
Domesday book,but Cranbrook is linked  
historically with the woollen and iron 
industries.Today's landmarks include   
the church of St Dunstans,the Cathedral
of the Weald,and  the Windmill.

an administrative,commercial and       
educational centre for the surrounding 
villages.Today Cranbrook places great  
importance on conservation,and         
developing the area for Tourism
