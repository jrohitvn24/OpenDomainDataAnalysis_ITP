 The area of south Lyndhurst is mainly 
 a residential area of predominantly   
 detached houses.   This indicates the 
 prosperous nature of the people living
 here.   Many people are moving to this
 area because of high employment and   
 this is why some large estates have   
 been built to accommodate them.  These
 new estates are not liked by the      
 foresters as they are all similar and 
 the foresters have cottages which are 
 all different and some are thatched.  
 Most of the foresters houses are tied 
 cottages, that is, owned by the       
 Forestry Commission.                  </content>
