		<title>07     SHARLSTON PIT</title>
		<content> Sharlston is a coal mining village,   
 with the pit at it's centre. The      
 coal is to be found 1500 feet beneath 
 the surface.The pit is about 600 years
 old and has gone through a lot of     
 changes.In the past miners used pick  
 and shovels.Tubs of coal would be     
 pulled by pit ponies.In it's heyday   
 2500 men and 120 ponies worked there. 
 Now there are  about 1000 people      
 working at the pit,using modern coal  
 cutting machines and conveyor belts to
 bring it out.The pit has about 15 to  
 20 years of life left in it.          
  The mining community are recovering  
 from the effcts of a year long        
 national strike,which was sparked off 
 by pit closures nationwide regarding  
 uneconomic pits.During the strike many
 of the miners ran up large debts,some 
 even sold their homes.
