		<content>   There are no doctors or dentists    
 surgeries in the area, therefore      
 people have to travel. A survey of 100
 families was taken. The majority of   
 people visit the doctors in Aspatria, 
 which involves a journey of an average
 two miles each way.                   
   Visiting the dentist shows more     
 variety, with 60% of the people going 
 to Cockermouth, 15% to Wigton, 15% to 
 Keswick, 5% to Maryport and 5% to     
 Aspatria. This involves travelling    
 anything up to twenty miles each way. 
   There is a Health Visitor in the    
 area, but her work is mainly with     
 pregnant women, new babies and young  
 children.                             
   Several of the old people have      
 regular visits from District Nurses   
 attached to doctors' practices, should
 they require regular treatments or    
 care.                                 </content>
