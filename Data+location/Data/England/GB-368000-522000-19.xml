		<title>19CAR-LESS IN BRAMPTON</title>
		<content> The withdrawal of the majority of the 
 scheduled bus services hsd caused some
 hardship to inhabitants of this rural 
 area.Those without a car now have to  
 rely on neighbours, friends or a taxi 
 to reach Appleby,the nearest town,more
 than 2 miles away.There are found the 
 doctors, dentists, banks &amp; shops.     
 There is a sub-post office in both    
 Dufton &amp; Brampton, combined with a    
 village shop in the former.Travelling 
 shops _ 2 bakers, grocery vans, a     
 butcher, fish &amp; chip &amp; ice cream      
 sellers, a tea merchant &amp; video hire  
 van are all well patronised, as is the
 Mobile Library.                       
 It is now more difficult for people to
 travel further afield as even Appleby 
 has only a twice weekly bus service   
 and has entirely lost its services to 
 the nearby towns of Kendal &amp; Kirkby   
 Stephen.                              </content>
