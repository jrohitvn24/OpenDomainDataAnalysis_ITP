		<title>19"BOW YOUTH CLUB HELPS"</title>
		<content> This account of village enterprise &amp;  
 generosity was taken from The Crediton
 Courier May 1985. "SERVED LUNCH FOR   
 OTHERS" Members of Bow Youth Club gave
 up Saturday morning to serve lunches  
 for Christian Aid.They were efficient 
 and cheerful waiters and waitresses   
 for the people who kept the Church    
 Room at Bow full for most of the lunch
 time. They offered,for Â£1,four sorts  
 of soup ,sandwiches,salad,coffee or   
 squash. There was much friendly       
 barracking of the waiting staff,but   
 they took it in good heart.Each table 
 was prettily decorated with a small   
 vase of flowers which has been given, 
 as was most of the food served that   
 morning.Mr.S.Saunders,club leader,said
 the idea grew from a comment made at a
 church meeting."
