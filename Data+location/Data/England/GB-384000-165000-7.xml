		<content>  ENTERTAINMENT_RECREATION             
  Because of the restrictions on new   
 houses due to the sewerage            
 problem,there are few second home     
 owners and commuters,this in spite of 
 the area being considered             
 desirable.This has meant that Atworth 
 has a very strong feeling of identity 
 and retains its village atmosphere.   
  This community feeling is reflected  
 in the flourishing clubs and events   
 that take place in the village.The    
 centre of activity is the Atworth     
 Institute where some of the following 
 clubs meet.18-80 Club,Toddlers        
 group,Playgroup,Beavers Club Youth    
 Club,Womens Fellowship,Ladies         
 Choir,60 Plus Club and St Johns       
 Ambulance Brigade.There is also a Judo
 dojo with a large membership that     
 competes nationally,with success.
