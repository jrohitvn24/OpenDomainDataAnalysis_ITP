		<content> I PLAY IN THE{CARLTON MINIOTT SCHOOL} 
 BRASS BAND.THERE ARE 5 CORNETS,3 TENOR
 HORNS AND 2 BARITONES.I PLAY A TENOR  
 HORN.I STARTED PLAYING 9 MONTHS AGO.IT
 IS NOW JULY 1985.DURING THAT TIME I   
 HAVE PLAYED IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL 3  
 TIMES AND I HAVE JUST PLAYED IN A     
 GARDEN FETE.THE BAND PRATICE 3 TIMES A
 WEEK.ONCE ON A MONDAY,ONCE ON A       
 WEDNESDAY AND ONCE ON A THURSDAY AFTER
 SCHOOL.WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TO PLAY A
 LOT OF PEOPLE COULDN'T READ MUSIC.NOW 
 EVERYONE CAN READ MUSIC.THERE IS MORE 
 TO PLAYING THAN YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU 
 HAVE TO CLEAN YOUR INSTRUMENT AND KEEP
 THE VALVES FROM STICKING.YOU DO THIS  
 BY PUTTING SOME OIL ON THEM.          
 WE ALL ENJOY PLAYING THE INSTRUMENTS  
 AND A LOT MORE PEOPLE WANT TO PLAY.
