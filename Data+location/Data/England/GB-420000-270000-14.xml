		<title>14WROXALL: THE ESTATE (1)</title>
		<content>{ }In 1945 the Forestry Commission took
 over the{Wroxall Estate,}and it was   
 planted with hard and soft woods.     
 Before then it was administered by the
 Park Royal Dog Company. Lady Millard, 
 the owner,comes from the{Dugdale      
 family,who lived at Wroxall Abbey     
 until 1935 when it became a school.   
   The Estate consists of{1250 acres.} 
 Most of the land is Grade 2,pre-heavy 
 clay.                                 
                                       
   The biggest change in farming in the
 area in recent years has been from{   
{milk production}to{arable.}Farmers on 
 the estate grow a 'break crop' called 
{horse rape,}because they cannot grow  
 corn all the year;it is used to make  
 lipstick and margarine. Rents used to 
 be 18p an acre or 17/6;they are now   
 Â£30-Â£40,so farmers cannot afford not  
 to grow a crop.                       </content>
