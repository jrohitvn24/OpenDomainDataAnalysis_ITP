 As a result of our visits to Smalley, 
 and talks with local people we came to
 the following conclusions:-           
 Smalley people are very friendly and  
 helpful; the population is decreasing 
 as families tend to be smaller; there 
 is not much noise; old people would   
 prefer more shops so they do not have 
 to travel to Derby or Heanor; it seems
 a pleasant place to live; there is not
 much evidence of vandalism; to get a  
 job is hard; there is too much traffic
 which makes it unsafe for children;   
 there are no public toilets; there is 
 plenty of countryside around; most    
 houses have burglar alarms; a number  
 of houses are for sale.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
