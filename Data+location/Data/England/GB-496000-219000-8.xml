		<title>08Home Life in Eaton Bray</title>
		<content>  Most people shop in the nearby towns 
 as the local shops are expensive and  
 do not offer the same choice of goods.
    The vast majority travel by car,   
 but for those relying on public       
 transport, there is an hourly service 
 to Dunstable (4 miles) and a          
 two-hourly service to Aylesbury (11   
 miles). To Leighton Buzzard (3.5      
 miles), the bus runs only twice a     
 week, on market days.                 
    A doctor's surgery and dispensary  
 has recently opened in Edlesborough,  
 and prescriptions can be collected    
 from Eaton Bray Post Office. Well     
 babies and toddlers can be seen at the
 mobile clinic which visit the villages
 each month. Mobile libraries visit EB 
 fortnightly and Edles. every 3 weeks. 
    A neighbourhood watch scheme is in 
 operation because of concern at the   
 growing number of house burgularies.  </content>
