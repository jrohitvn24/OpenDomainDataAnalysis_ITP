		<content> Between 11 am and 11.45 am on June    
 20th 1985 we did a survey on the      
 A1000.  We were able to record traffic
 movements into and out of our Domesday
 area via the A1(M).  We found that    
 movement into and out of Welwyn was   
 almost equal.  There were 6 times as  
 many cars as lorries.  Of all the     
 cars, there were as many that were    
 only 2 years old as the rest put      
 together.  A lot of these were        
 Cavaliers and Sierras, so we decided  
 most of the drivers must be company   
 reps. who change cars every 2 years.  
 Only 1 in 4 cars had any passengers.  
 We thought people should share and not
 waste petrol, but then we realised    
 people could be going to all sorts of 
 places once they reached the A1.  Blue
 and red were the most popular car     
 colours, and white was favourite for  
 vans. {SEAN MERCER (11)               </content>
