		<title>20CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content> Some  children from  our class such as
 karen, Moira, Lois and I play elastics
 The  method  of  playing  is  that two
 children face each other with  elastic
 bands round their ankles. Then someone
 jumps over the elastic bands which are
 stretched  across.  There are a number
 of different kinds of jumps.          
 We sometimes play rounders and tig. We
 also  play  netball  and my  favourite
 games  are  rounders  and  elastics. I
 don't like netball very much.         
 At home another game I like to play is
 exploring.  Sometimes I ask my grandma
 if  I  can  dig  up  the   garden  and
 investigate things that are underneath
 such as  spiders,  worms and pieces of
 pottery.  Then  I  put them  all back.
 Once I  went to Howley  with a  friend
 and found  lots  of  things. I brought
 them home but then I gave them away.
