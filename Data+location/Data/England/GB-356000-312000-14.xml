		<content> RODINGTON SCHOOL IS A CHURCH OF       
 ENGLAND PRIMARY SCHOOL CONTROLLED BY  
 SHROPSHIRE L. E. A. AND THEREFORE,    
 FINANCED BY THEM.  WHEN THE SCHOOL WAS
 FIRST OPENED IN 1849, ONLY 4 MANAGERS 
 WERE APPOINTED, THE RECTOR, A         
 GENTLEMAN, AND 2 FARMERS.  THEY WERE  
 RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPENSES, BOOKS,  
 STATIONERY, SALARIES AND REPAIRS.  A  
 NEW INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT COMES    
 INTO EFFECT IN SEPTEMBER 1985.  THERE 
 WILL BE 8 GOVERNORS, 9 IF THE HEAD    
 ELECTS TO BE A GOVERNOR. THE SCHOOL   
 HAS TWO FULL-TIME TEACHERS, A COOK, A 
 CLEANER, A DINNER LADY AND AN         
 ANCILLARY FOR FIVE HOURS SECRETARIAL  
 WORK A WEEK. THERE ARE 35 CHILDREN ON 
 ROLL. THERE ARE 2 CLASSES,THE INFANTS,
 AGED FROM 5 TO 7 YEARS AND THE        
 JUNIORS, AGED FROM 7 TO 11 YEARS. THE 
 FUTURE OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE IN DOUBT 
 IF THE NUMBER ON ROLL DROPS BELOW 30. </content>
