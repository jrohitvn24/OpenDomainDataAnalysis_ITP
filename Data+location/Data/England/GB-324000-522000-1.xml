		<title>01General review of the block.</title>
		<content> This block contains the northern end  
 of Lake Derwentwater.Much of the well 
 wooded shore line is owned by the     
 National Trust and open to the        
 public.Landing stages on the eastern  
 side have rowing boats for hire and   
 public launch services round the      
 lake.The town of Keswick is a busy    
 tourist centre in summer.It has many  
 gift shops and a market on            
 Saturday.The residential village of   
 Portinscale is a pleasant walk from   
 Keswick through fields and over the   
 River Derwent by a metal suspension   
 bridge.The north western corner of the
 block is low lying grass land for     
 sheep and dairy farming, bordering on 
 wet bog land.The eastern corner       
 contains a hill called Latrigg.This is
 a foothill of Skiddaw,the third       
 highest mountain in England.This is   
 one of the best view points.          </content>
