		<title>18TOURISM, CARAVAN SITE</title>
		<content> THE MANAGERESS OF THE NORMANS BAY     
 CARAVAN SITE HAS BEEN THERE 6 YEARS.  
 THEY HAVE 175 CARAVANS ON THE SITE. IT
 HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED 20 YEARS. SOME   
 VILLAGERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE   
 CAMP. THERE IS SOMETIMES A BIT OF     
 VANDALISM. THE SEASON STARTS ON MARCH 
 1, AND FINISHES OCTOBER 31. DOGS MUST 
 BE KEPT UNDER CONTROL, AND NO BALL    
 GAMES ARE ALLOWED ON THE SITE. THE    
 MANAGER AND MANAGERESS DO NOT HAVE A  
 HOLIDAY DURING THE SEASON.            
 MR COSSER OWNS 50 ACRES OF LAND WHERE 
 HE KEEPS SHEEP AND CATTLE. IN WINTER  
 HE TAKES THEM TO HIS CROWHURST FARM,  
 LOWER WILTEN FARM. HE HAS 120 ANIMALS 
 ALTOGETHER SPREAD BETWEEN BOTH FARMS. 
 ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES HE HAS     
 NOTICED IS THAT THE ANIMALS DO NOT    
 LIVE SO LONG NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE  
 TO BUY LEANER MEAT, SO THEY ARE KILLED
 EARLIER.                              </content>
