		<title>03BOXWORTH - ENTERTAINMENT</title>
		<content> Boxworth can be said to be a quiet    
 village, the two focal points of      
 entertainment being the Golden Ball   
 public house and the Church Hall.     
 Whereas the public house is used by   
 most residents throughout the month,  
 the Church Hall is used infrequently. 
 The Women's Institute use it once a   
 month and there is the occasional     
 private party. Most people in the     
 village say there is very little to do
 and if they require sophisticated     
 entertainment such as cinema or       
 theatre, they visit Cambridge or      
 Huntingdon. Private cars are essential
 as public transport does not pass     
 through the village late at night. The
 village is well endowed with public   
 paths and woodlands which are often   
 used. On the A604 there is another    
 public house often used, "The Trinity 
 Foot".                                </content>
