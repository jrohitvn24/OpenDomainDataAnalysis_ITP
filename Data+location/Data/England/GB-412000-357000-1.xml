   Our block is situated in the{Peak   
{Park}area of Derbyshire.  It includes 
 part of the{River Dove}with the       
 beautiful{Beresford, Wolfscote}and    
{Biggin Dales.                         
    The agricultural land is divided   
 into small fields which are surrounded
 by dry-stone walls.                   
    The village of{Biggin}with its     
 population of approximately{275 people
 is situated in the most northernly    
 corner of our block. Lack of public   
 transport makes the village fairly    
 isolated and amenities are few.       
   However, the village has become     
 quite well known for the{annual Autumn
{sheep sales.                          
   There are many disused{lead mines}in
 the area.
