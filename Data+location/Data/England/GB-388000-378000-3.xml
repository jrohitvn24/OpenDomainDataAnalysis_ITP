		<title>03A MODERN VILLAGE PUB</title>
		<content>   The Bull's Head is a pub on the edge
 of Mottram St. Andrew village. It is  
 surrounded by a huge car park, which  
 is full of cars nearly every night.   
 People come from as far as Wilmslow,  
 Bramhall and Macclesfield to have a   
 meal because it is not only a pub it  
 is a resaurant as well. The restaurant
 is the most important part of the     
 Bull's Head. Recently changes took    
 place, Beefeater took over.  Beefeater
 is a chain of Steak Houses owned by   
 Whitbread. Beefeater extended the pub 
 to make room for a Steak House. They  
 carried out many internal alterations.
 The Bull's Head is not the only place 
 where you can get a drink in Mottram. 
 There is a bar at the Village Hall    
 which is open on Sunday and Tuesday.

 Anderson.
