		<content>     THERE ARE TWO MUSEUMS IN          
 CHRISTCHURCH, THE RED HOUSE MUSEUM AND
 THE TRICYCLE MUSEUM WHICH ARE BOTH    
 SITUATED NEAR THE QUAY. THE RED HOUSE 
 CONTAINS MANY ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST,
 PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE EARLY    
 HISTORY OF A LOCAL PROMONTORY CALLED  
 HENGISTBURY HEAD, WHICH WAS AN        
 IMPORTANT IRON-AGE PORT.  THE MUSEUM  
 ALSO HAS AN INTERESTING NATURAL       
 HISTORY COLLECTION, A DISPLAY OF OLD  
 COSTUMES AND A RESTFUL GARDEN WITH A  
 FISHPOND.   THE TRICYCLE MUSEUM, WHICH
 OPENED IN 1984, CONTAINS UNICYCLES,   
 BICYCLES AND TRICYCLES OF VARIOUS     
 AGES.                                 
     IN MILLHAMS STREET THERE IS A     
 GALLERY AND WORKSHOP WHERE LOCAL      
 ARTISTS AND CRAFTSMEN DISPLAY THEIR   
 WORK. THE REGENT CENTRE, A FORMER     
 BINGO HALL, IS USED FOR THE PERFORMING
 ARTS.                                 </content>
