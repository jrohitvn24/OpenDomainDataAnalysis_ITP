		<title>06THE RIVER AND DOCKS</title>
		<content>   The docks were opened in 1963 and   
 was opened by Sir William Worsley who 
 was then a minister of state. 650     
 people work at the docks and the      
 working hours are 2 o'clock till 10   
 and 6 o'clock till 2 o'clock.         
       The biggest cargo was 5650 cars 
 they also get timber, steel girders   
 and alot more things. The size of the 
 docks is about 7 football pitches, 303
 ships can fit in at one time. The     
 biggest ship weighs 165 thousand tons 
 which was an oil tanker. Alot of the  
 cargo comes from Australia,America,   
 Brazil and Japan.The docks get 5000   
 ships a year and 2000 more come up and
 down the river. Some ships have to be 
 painted bright so when the other ships
 see the ship coming they have to stop 
 because the ship has explosives on    
 board. Uniform depends on the cargo.
