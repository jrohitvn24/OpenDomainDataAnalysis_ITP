		<title>16COTTAGE HOSPITAL PENRITH.</title>
		<content> A petition against closing the Cottage
 Hospital was signed by people all     
 over England."How did they know about 
 the Cottage Hospital?",you may well   
 ask.Some people may have gone there   
 for treatment or they may have        
 relatives who may have been treated   
 there.The council do not know what    
 they will build there because in 1945 
 the Government bought all the         
 privately-owned hospitals for the     
 National Health Service.              
 At the time of writing the future of  
 the building is undecided.            
 Ownership of the building is unclear. 
 There is a list of public subscribers 
 inside the front porch.               
 The land on which the building stands 
 was donated privately by Lowther      
 Estates.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
