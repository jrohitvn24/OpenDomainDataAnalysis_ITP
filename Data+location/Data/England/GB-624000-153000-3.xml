		<content> The countryside in which the parish of
 Goodnestone with Chillenden is set is 
 of a rolling character. Arable farming
 is the main activity. There is also   
 some sheep farming. The land is light_
 ly wooded with a mixture of decidious 
 trees and a variety of approaches to  
 cultivation. These range from allowing
 woodland to mature and die to a posi_ 
 tive management policy. Apart from the
 wooded areas, in general it is clear  
 that agriculture policies of recent   
 years have given the countryside a    
 generally open appearance. There are  
 very few hedges, or isolated trees,   
 and cultivation takes place right up  
 to the edge of the roads. To the north
 of the village the view towards Wing_ 
 ham is dominated by a large silo. This
 is an E.E.C. intervention grain store.
