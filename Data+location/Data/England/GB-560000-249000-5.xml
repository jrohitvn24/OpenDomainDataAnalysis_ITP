		<title>05EVENTS AROUND WEST WRATTING</title>
		<content>{Charity Event:-}A large village fete  
 was held in West Wratting in August in
 aid of Leukaemia Research. Â£1,070 was 
 raised, a huge amount for such a small
 village. It was widely supported and  
 Radio Cambridge, our local radio      
 station did a piece about it.         
{Annual Events:-}In West Wratting the  
 local mothers get together at         
 Christmas and organise a children's   
 party in the village hall. Money is   
 raised through the year via jumble    
 sales etc. and this has been taking   
 place for 30 years or more. The W.I.  
 puts on a show and Christmas Dinner to
 entertain the over 60's. Again money  
 is raised through the year in order to
 pay for it.                           
{West Wickham:-}A pub was re-opened in 
 1985. For the first time in years the 
 residents had somewhere they could    
 meet regularly and mix socially.      </content>
