		<content> Hundreds of years ago people didn't   
 bother to read or write,even the kings
 and queens couldn't read or write they
 just put a red mark on their          
 documents.                            
 The only record of our school is an   
 early date in  the date of the first  
 headmaster in the year of 1787 from   
 early maps of the village for example 
 the school is marked.                 
 The oldest part of the school is the  
 hall,kitchen and upper infant's room  
 were built in 1850.There are two ways 
 we know this the first way is that    
 Earl Cowper the man who built our     
 school kept a book and always kept an 
 account of the pay of the             
 builders.They used to have a big fire 
 in the hall.They also had oil lamp's  
 for lighting.The Caretaker had to     
 bring the coal and firewood himself   
 they all worked in the hall.]]]]]]    </content>
