		<title>06INTERVIEW AT GROVE FARM.</title>
		<content> The farmer's wife said"It's very nice 
 to live on a farm."She also said that 
 it can be very hard work.She has been 
 on{Grove Farm}for 50 years.The        
 farmhouse was built in 1866.Many years
 ago horses were kept to plough as     
 there weren't any tractors.The        
 farmer's son has about 5,000          
 chickens.Altogether there are 5,150   
 animals.Children go to Church Lench   
 school from Radford,and then used to  
 go to Worcester Grammar school.If you 
 liked car racing when you left school 
 you could go stock car racing.If you  
 had lots of boys,the best place to    
 live is on a farm.Turkeys sometimes   
 get very excited at night and all you 
 have to do is to get red windows to   
 make the barn light and then they     
 behave better.
