The area includes an industrial estate 
which was the first created to serve   
the expanding town of Wellingborough   
which was receiving people in an       
overspill agreement with the Greater   
London Council. Firms, which were      
mainly of the light industrial type,   
moved into the estate because of the   
good communications with the rest of   
the country through motorway and rail. 
The firms on the estate have prospered 
and expanded and now employ            
considerably more people, many of whom 
are indigenous area, and are exporting 
their products all over the world. We  
were told by several of the firms that 
they were still expanding and trading  
well despite the national recession.
