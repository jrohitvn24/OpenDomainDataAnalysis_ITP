		<title>01The Town of Penrith</title>
		<content> Penrith is an ancient market town and 
 the chief town in the Eden District of
 Cumbria.  It is the centre of         
 administration, and a service area for
 the surrounding rural community.  The 
 town is now by-passed by the M6       
 motorway, but it is still an important
 road junction, and has been since     
 Roman times.  Penrith is called "The  
 Northern Gateway" to the Lake         
 district.  The town is quiet during   
 the winter months, as the people of   
 Penrith carry on with their daily     
 lives.  Things change during the      
 summer months as the tourist season   
 starts.  Penrith becomes a very busy  
 town, and a centre for the tourists,  
 because there is easy access to the   
 lakes and fells, and the beautiful    
 surrounding country side.
