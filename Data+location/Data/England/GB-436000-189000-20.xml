		<content> Christian Barnard lived in S.Africa   
 and pioneered heart transplant        
 operations. Many people criticised him
 because for the first few years they  
 didn't seem to work. John Haines lives
 in Denchworth and 3 years ago was     
 about to die when he was given the    
 chance to have a heart transplant at  
 Harefield Hospital in Middlesex. His  
 surgeon was Magdi Yacoub. Since the   
 operation John, now 47, no longer has 
 to sit all the time and suffer pain   
 and breathlessness. In 1983 and 1984  
 he went back to Harefield hospital to 
 raise money for other patients having 
 heart transplants, to run in sponsored
 races and compete in the British      
 Transplant Games. Back home after his 
 operation he began to dig his garden  
 again, then he went back to work as a 
 kitchen fitter.
