		<title>10BOWNESS-ON-SOLWAY.BUILDINGS.</title>
		<content> Bowness stands literally on its Roman 
 foundations (see:HISTORY TO 1603).    
 Its main street (E-W) is closely      
 aligned on that of the fort. Much     
 pillaged stone has been used and      
 re-used. The village has mostly small 
 scale dwellings and narrow streets.   
 Pevsner gives the Church as late      
 Norman with restorations of 1891. The 
 Rectory is of Gothic style, but       
 built in 1922. Most houses &amp; cottages 
 are in local red sandstone, cobble or 
 brick, some rendered, all with slate  
 roofs. Dating varies from 17C. to 19C.
 Sub P.O., school extensions &amp; some    
 bungalows &amp; houses on village edges   
 are 20C. Bowness House Farm (village  
 centre) incorporates a listed         
 building, probably oldest extant, in  
 red sandstone with ornate doorcase.   
 Interior date reads 1694.
