 The Mall is probably the main shopping
 centre in Dagenham. It was opened in  
 1980.It is an advantage to many people
 because, there is somewhere for them  
 to do their shopping. To some people  
 in Blackbourne road however it is a   
 disadvantage, because the people who  
 do their shopping in Sainsburies, park
 their cars down Blackbourne road ,and 
 they leave their trollies there.      
   The Mall could have been a good idea
 , but all it seems to consist of are  
 cheap shops and jewellers. People     
 still travel to Ilford or Romford for 
 the better stores like Marks and      
 Spencers. There has also been a lot of
 vandalism in the car park. Today the  
 Mall has a security system operating  
 which consists of security men, video 
 cameras and iron fencing at night.
