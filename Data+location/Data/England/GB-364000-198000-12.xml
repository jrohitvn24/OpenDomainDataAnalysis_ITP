		<title>12THE MILL, BERKELEY VALE (1)</title>
		<content> Built in the late 18th century on     
 the{Berkeley Castle Estate,}Sea Mills,
 as it was known then, was a water     
 powered{grist mill}for the castle.    
 In 1967 when Berkeley Power station   
 was built and the land around was     
 drained, the mill lost its water      
 and so is now{electrically driven.    
 The mill, known now as Englands Mills,
{Stoneground Flour Millers,}produces   
 real flours with{no chemical additives
 and other products such as muesli,    
 bran and wheatgerm. The{small mill}is 
 making a{comeback}due to the eating   
 habits of today. The larger mills such
 as Spillers in Avonmouth are making   
 cutbacks in white flour consumption   
 and so many ex-large-mill-workers are 
{redeveloping the small mills,}such as 
 this one.                             
 The mill has a workforce of five      
 incuding the owner and his daughter.  </content>
