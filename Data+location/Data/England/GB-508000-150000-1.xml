		<content> This area is mainly woods, farmland &amp; 
 commons traversed by many bridleways, 
 public footpaths, a few narrow lanes &amp;
 a major road running East/West on the 
 N. perimeter which carries a very     
 heavy load for which it is unsuitable.
 There is no river or pond. Most houses
 are large as this is a wealthy area   
 but there is a small council estate &amp; 
 several flint cottages built by the   
 Earls of Lovelace.  There is little   
 obvious sense of community but when   
 threatened with an Indian curry rest_ 
 aurant/takeaway on the shopping parade
 a protest was lodged &amp; the application
 refused.  There is no bank, doctor or 
 dentist. The shops include post office
 newsagent, chemist, butcher (grocer &amp; 
 greengrocer recently closed), a travel
 agency, horse_riding accessory suppl- 
 ier, delicatessen &amp; health food shop, 
 all indicating a wealthy clientele.   </content>
