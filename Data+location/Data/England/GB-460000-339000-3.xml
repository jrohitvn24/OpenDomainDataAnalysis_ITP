		<title>03More on Colwick Woods</title>
		<content> On 5th May 1985 at about 11 a.m. we   
 went to Colwick woods we were there   
 for about 2 1/4 hours. Lee,Ian and me 
 were doing a survey Lee did plants    
 trees and mushrooms, Ian did insects  
 and mammals and I did birds.          
 We covered a lot of ground and saw a  
 lot of birds, mammals etc. I saw      
 magpies,blackbirds, swifts, sparrows  
 and many more. Some were singing, some
 flying and a few were swimming. My dad
 came with us and we took my dog called
 Jamie. We also saw bluetits, greattits
 some mute swans, black headed gulls   
 and a mistle thrush.                  
 The most we saw were house sparrows   
 flying in a flock of 27. Colwick woods
 is such a good area because the lakes 
 for swans etc and woods for robins ,  
 house martins etc and the under groth 
 for readbuntings etc.
