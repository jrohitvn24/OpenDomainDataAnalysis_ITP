		<title>05INDUSTRY THROSTLE YARNS</title>
		<content>{EDMONDSON BROTHERS}is a small spinning
 works owned by two brothers.The wool  
 is delivered from Bradford once a     
 month and is twisted into yarn using  
 machinery which is based on that      
 invented by{Richard Arkwright}at the  
 beginning of the Industrial           
 Revolution.As well as wool other kinds
 of yarn are also mixed in the spinning
 such as mohair,silk and alpacca.The   
 most expensive yarn is wool/silk      
 mixture which would cost Â£3 per 50    
 grams.The finished yarn is used       
 for hand-knitting.The works are part  
 of a large factory and are in the old 
 engine shed which was very dirty and  
 run-down when they moved in.Mr.Douglas
 Edmondson has worked in textiles all  
 his working life,and quite likes the  
 job,but would have liked to have been 
 a professional musician.He plays banjo
 with a Dixieland Jazz Band.           </content>
