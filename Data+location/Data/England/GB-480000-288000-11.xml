		<title>11THE POST OFFICE EAST CARLTON</title>
		<content>Mrs Hubbard runs the Post Office in a  
Council house where she has lived with 
her husband since 1965.They have       
converted a toilet and coal cellar into
the shop.                              
They sell essentials such as goceries &amp;
fire making sticks as well as sweets &amp; 
cigarettes.They do not sell newspapers 
as these are delivered from Wilbarston.
Most sales are of 17p and  13p postage 
stamps.                                
On Thursday mornings,the old age       
pensioners are paid and the shop is    
very busy.Tuesday is family allowance  
day,and some unemployment benefit is   
also paid.                             
Villagers use the notice board outside 
the shop for details of village events.
It is a very important place for this  
small village.
