		<title>04ADIT MINING AROUND ST.AGNES</title>
		<content> DUE TO THE GROUND BEING ONCE RICH IN  
 TIN ORE THE AREA ALONG THE COASTLINE  
 IS RIDDLED WITH DISUSED ADITS.ADITS   
 ARE MINING TUNNELS WHICH START AT THE 
 BASE OF THE CLIFF GOING SLIGHTLY      
 UPWARDS SO THAT THEY WILL NOT FLOOD.AN
 ADIT IS EASIER TO MINE THAN A TUNNEL  
 INLAND BECAUSE NO MACHINERY IS NEEDED 
 TO DRAIN OUT WATER AND LIFT ROCK AND  
 MEN UP AND DOWN THE SHAFT.ONE TUNNEL  
 DIVIDES INTO OTHER TUNNELS LEADING OFF
 IN ALL DIRECTIONS SO IT IS VERY EASY  
 TO GET LOST.IN THE WALLS THERE ARE    
 LOTS OF MINERALS. THESE ADITS ARE IN  
 PLACES SUPPORTED BY TIMBERS.ADITS ARE 
 VERY DANGEROUS PLACES LANDSLIDES      
 OFTEN BLOCK THEM UP AND IF THE TIMBERS
 SNAP THE ROOF MAY CAVE IN BLOCKING THE
 TUNNEL.
