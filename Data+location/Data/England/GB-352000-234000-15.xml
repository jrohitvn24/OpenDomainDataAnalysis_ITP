		<content> We carried out a{door to door survey  
 in the village, and most people were  
{very helpful}with their answers.  Some
 were{suspicious of being questioned,  
 but didn't mind if their names weren't
 mentioned, and some were{quite happy  
 when we said it was{for the BBC.  }At 
 some houses we were invited in and    
 given{drinks and biscuits.  }It was   
 interesting how{very different people 
 were, even in such a small village.   
 People have lived here for between 3  
 weeks and all their lives, but the    
 average was{9 years.  }Most of them   
 had{moved}here{from Hereford.  }They  
 mostly like the village because it is 
{quiet and peaceful,}it's near         
 Hereford, they are{near their work}and
 their friends, and they{like the      
{people}in the village, though one old 
 lady hinted that it was not all as    
 nice as it seemed. We didn't like her.</content>
