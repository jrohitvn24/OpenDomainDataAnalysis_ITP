<title>21Isle of Wight trip</title>

<content>



On Monday 28th March 2011 I again got up early.  I was staying in a B&amp;B in Freshwater on the Isle of Wight with my mate Frances.  Simon, the owner of the B&amp;B, had said we could make our own breakfast, so we cooked up some scrambled eggs.  As it was our last day on the island, we packed up our stuff and put it in the car.  Then we set off to Freshwater Bay.  We went in search of a memorial to a child who had fallen off the cliffs in the 19th century.  After a short walk we found it.  It was quite moving.  Then we headed off to Osbourne House, but were disappointed to find it closed.  So we decided to go to Robin Hill Country Park instead.  Here we watched a falconry display.  Then it was time to go home so we hopped on the ferry back to Southampton.  I was, once again, sad to go home.   &lt;br />
