		<content>{SOIL TYPES}are London, Jurassic clay  
 and medium loam. Some fields are      
 drained.                              
 Soil improvers used are manure and    
 chemical fertilizers                  
 Hedges are cut and ditches cleared to 
 promote good drainage.                
 In woodland the pathways are trimmed  
 and dead wood felled.                 
{PONDS}occur frequently in the fields, 
 some natural and others were          
 originally dug out to provide water   
 for cattle and horses. The clay lump  
 was used as a building material.      
{FIELD SIZES}in the area, are generally
 less than 15 acres with only one of 30
 acres. A farm of 330 acres has 16     
 miles of hedges and ditches.          
 25 years ago 10 men were necessary to 
 run a farm worked today by 2 men.     
 Yields are tripled with aid from plant
 breeders and use of machinery.        </content>
