		<content> The majority of land in the area is   
 farmed with very few areas which are  
 unused.Most of the agricultural land  
 is intensively managed{grassland}and  
 has been so for some considerable time
 though at one time Deer rather than   
 farm stock grazed in a Royal deer park
 which covered mostof this area.Now    
 the grassland is grazed by cattle     
 ,usually{dairy}cattle with the most   
 popular breed being the Freisian.The  
 other use of grassland is for{Silage  
 which is the practice of cutting green
 grass,usually around the third week in
 May for the following three or four   
 weeks.These "grass cuttings" are then 
 stored in a barn or under a large     
 plastic sheet and fed to the cattle in
 winter as winter feed.This is an      
 increasingly popular way of storing   
 winter fodder which has become common 
 over the last fifteen or twenty years.</content>
