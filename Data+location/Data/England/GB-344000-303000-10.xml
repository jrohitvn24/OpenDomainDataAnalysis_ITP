		<content>                                       
 Longden is the main village which     
 serves the area but is just outside   
 the survey region.The village centre  
 is around three sides of a crossroad. 
 The Post Office is the focal point of 
 the village and is also the village   
 shop.It has been in its present       
 position since 1974 and meets most of 
 the purchasing needs of the area.There
 is also a public house called 'The    
 Tankerville' named after a famous     
 local family which made its fortune   
 from lead mining in the nineteenth    
 century.                              
  There is also a church which is      
 Anglican and a church school whose    
 catchment area includes all the survey
 area except the vicinity of           
 Dorrington.                           
  The village hall and playing fields  
 is in memory of Sir Douglas Swire.    </content>
