Caldecott is another small village     
situated on a main road. It is next to 
the old railway line where there is the
station of Rockingham. Running through 
the village is the Eye Brook which     
links the Eyebrook Reservoir with the  
River Welland. The village has two pubs
and a village shop. Most of the houses 
are small old stone built ones many    
with thatch roofes.There is one church 
at the northern end of the village.
