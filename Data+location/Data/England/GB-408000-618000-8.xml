		<title>08Farms and Farming.</title>
		<content>  The farming land in this area is very
 mixed, most of it being{grade 2       
{Agricultural land.                    
{Summer }work includes concentration on
 land work and sheep sheering.         
 In{Winter}the farmers are busy doing  
 general repairs and maintaining       
 machinery. There is much feeding of   
 livestock to be done. The quality and 
 numbers of animals has improved with  
 the aid of breeding programmes and the
 development of medicines.             
  The{Beef cattle, cows}and{sheep}are  
 fed on corn usually saved from the    
 harvest, also hay or straw. The{sheep}
 also get turnips.{Developments in     
{machinery}and more{intensive methods  
 over the years have reduced the       
 manpower on farms which is reflected  
 in fewer estate and farm houses being 
 occupied by land workers and a falling
 role of village school pupils!        </content>
