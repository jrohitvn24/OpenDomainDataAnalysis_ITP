		<content>{TRANSPORT:-}                          
 The nearest railway station is at     
 Whitby about 4 miles away and this    
 station has very few trains.The trains
 only go to Teesside.                  
 Buses provide an hourly service       
 through the village on their way from 
 Middlesbrough to Whitby and the       
 return.The fares are expensive and the
 journeys slow.Most people depend upon 
 their own vehicle.                    
{TOURISM:-}                            
 Many tourists visit the Whitby area in
 summer.Lythe offers accomodation at   
 the Red Lion Inn as well as in a      
 number of private houses.There are a  
 few holiday cottages in the village   
 and also there is a caravan site near 
 the Red Lion and a camp site at       
 Deepgrove Farm.
