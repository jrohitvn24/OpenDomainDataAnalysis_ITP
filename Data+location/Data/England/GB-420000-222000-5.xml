		<title>05THORN'S FARM, ICOMB</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mrs,Peace who lives at 
 Thorns Farm,Icomb.They are new to the 
 area.They came from near Stroud.They  
 own nearly 40 acres.They have 100     
 sheep.The breeds are Welsh            
 Mountains,Clun Forest,Kerrys and      
 Suffolk rams,so the lambs are Suffolk 
 crosses.There are no cattle on the    
 Farm.It is very busy in the lambing   
 season.The Farm dose not pay for its  
 self yet so Mr.peace works as a       
 Lecturer with the Youth Training      
 Scheme.This year Mr.Peace is also     
 growing swedes and turnips to feed the
 sheep.
