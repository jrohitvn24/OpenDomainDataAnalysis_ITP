		<content> Arlington Court and estate of 3471    
 acres, was bequeathed to the National 
 Trust by Miss Rasalie chichester in   
 1949.  During the  summer months it   
 receives many visitors, anxious to see
 Miss Chichester's collection, the     
 stables with the carriages and the    
 beautiful parkland.  The general      
 public also come in the Winter to     
 watch birds, geese and other winter   
 visitors to the lake.   The           
 surrounding country is steep and well 
 wooded with many farms.  The small    
 farms have grassland for cattle and   
 sheep.  The steep-sided valleys       
 leading to the River Teo and tributary
 are wooded and very beautiful. There  
 are scattered hamlets where people are
 tenants of the estate and some are    
 working in the grounds and woodland.
