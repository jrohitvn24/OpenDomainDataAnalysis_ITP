		<title>09CIDER MAKING IN DUNSFORD.</title>
		<content> Before mechanisation farms which are  
 now run by one man had many permanent 
 workers and extra casual labour at    
 harvest.Most farms produced cider for 
 family and workers.One local farmer   
 still produces cider but for sale.    
{CIDER MAKING.}Collect large quanties  
 of ripe apples,bitter,sour and sweet. 
 A mixture of these is washed,chopped  
 and then taken to the press.A layer of
 straw is spread over the base of the  
 press.A thick layer of chopped apple  
 is spread over this and overhanging   
 straw is turned up.Then more straw and
 more apple is added until about a yard
 high.Apple juice wil run into a large 
 open vat.Gradually the press will be  
 tightened until all the juice is out. 
 The juice is poured into huge barrels 
 and left to ferment.Different         
 mixtures produce dry,medium or sweet  
 ciders.                               </content>
