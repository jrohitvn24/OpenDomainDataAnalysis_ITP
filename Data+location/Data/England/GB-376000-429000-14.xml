		<content> Our First Year trip was to{Blackpool }
 Zoo.When we were in the First Year the
 trip sounded exciting,but now I am a  
 Fourth Year it sounds boring.We saw   
 animals like zebras,lions and         
 tigers.In the Second Year,we went to  
{Blackpool Model Village}in Stanley    
 Park and then to the {Tower Circus}   
   In the Third Year,we dressed up and 
 acted like{Tudor people}in a Tudor    
 house.We were wearing heavy           
 costumes,and the day we were there,the
 weather was boiling hot.              
   This year we went to {Camelot}at    
 Charnock Richard.It was a lovely day  
 and we had a great time on the {Space 
{Ride}which went really fast.It was    
 good on the{Big Wheel}but the person I
 sat next to kept rocking the chair.It 
 was the best School Trip ever.A School
 Trip is when the class pays money to  
 go by coach somewhere.Claire Walmsley.</content>
