		<content>{GRANGE FARM LEGBOURNE                 
 This farm of 420 acres is mostly      
 dairy.Mr.Harrison has 121 Britiish    
 Friesian cows and 79 heifers served by
 Canadian Holstein bulls. The cows feed
 on grass in the summer and silage,    
 straw,mollasses,sugar beet pulp       
 pellets,maize glutan, rolled barley,  
 and rape seed meal in winter. Each cow
 has a number and a name handed down   
 from her mother and a check is kept on
 her milk production and she is fed    
 accordingly.Cows listen to the radio  
 while being milked in the parlour.    
 2000 litres of milk are collected each
 day by tanker. A sample is taken for  
 analysis. The milk is bought by The   
 Milk Marketing Board and usually goes 
 to the Hull Dairies. The farm produces
 700,000litres of milk per year.       
 Mr. Harrison makes his own silage from
 grass.                                </content>
