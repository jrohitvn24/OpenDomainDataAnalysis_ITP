At playtimes we play many games.Mostly 
they are games of chase but skipping   
and clapping games are popular with the
9-10 yrs.A favourite chase game is     
Â£semies'.A chosen person has to run    
around all four marked points without  
getting caught by the Â£it' person.When 
they return,everyone else has to run   
around the same route.Those who are    
caught out,help catch the rest.We also 
play team games, one of which is       
"Ladders".In Ladders you have two equal
teams.These sit facing each other with 
legs outstreched towards there partner.
A number is given to each pair,who,when
called,run around everyones legs.The   
person who arrives at their space first
gets a point for their team.We also    
play,as follows:War,Football,Skipping, 
Pretend Families,Acting,Peep Behind the
Curtain and Clock Works.               </content>
