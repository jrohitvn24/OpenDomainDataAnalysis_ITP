		<content>{Mrs.Annie Burt,aged 82 years,who was  
{born at Manor Farm,Oakerthorpe and    
{still lives within a quarter of a mile
{of her birth-place remembers her child
{hood.}                                
 I had to rise at 04:45 to bring in the
 cattle and then help to milk them.Then
 the coal and sticks had to be fetched 
 to light the fire.My next job was to  
 take the milk on the cart to Wingfield
 Station to catch the 06:55 train for  
 Sheffield where it was sold.          
 Twenty pounds of butter had to then be
 churned by the children. Buttermilk   
 was sold in the village for one penny 
 a pint.                               
 My sister would plough from 06:00     
 until 18:00 with a break to change the
 horses at midday.                     
 We had 30 pigs to look after as well. 
 Sometimes we would help the miners to 
 cart coal at the nearby pit.          </content>
