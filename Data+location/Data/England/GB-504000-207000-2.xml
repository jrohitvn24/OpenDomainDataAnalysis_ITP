		<title>02DAILY ROUTINE IN HEMEL</title>
		<content>    The average start to my day is 7am 
 when my alarm clock booms loudly every
 second. I then do the essential       
 morning things, washing, dressing,    
 making the bed etc. After completing  
 these I sometimes do the mounds of    
 washing up, and then participate in   
 some early morning activity.          
    After lunch I settle down to watch 
 an afternoon film or something good on
 the video. After this I tidy my room  
 and in the process find something     
 interesting and ponder over it until I
 feel I must take back my overdue      
 library books.                        
    In the evening I usually sneak off 
 to my room, which my sister shares    
 with me, to do some sewing or settle  
 down to watch the screen of the telly.
