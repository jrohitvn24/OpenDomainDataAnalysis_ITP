		<title>06Bexhill Youth - The Problems</title>
		<content> The facilities for young people are   
 not very good, there isn't even a     
{swimming pool}open in the town at the 
 moment. Other sports facilities are   
{fishing and golf.}The only other      
 sports facilities are in schools.     
 The shopping facilities for young     
 people are also poor. The clothes     
 shops are not up-to-date and are      
 expensive compared to surrounding     
 areas.                                
 Bexhill does not really cater for     
 young people. It is a small seaside   
 resort where people go for a quiet    
 holiday or to retire. The town        
 consists mostly of residential homes  
 and places of interest are mainly     
 castles and monuments. Most of the    
 teenagers living in Bexhill go to the 
{Hastings Pier Disco}on a Friday,      
 because there is nothing like that in 
 Bexhill.                              </content>
