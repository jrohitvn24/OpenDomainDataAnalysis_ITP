		<title>01SUMMARY OF LOWESTOFT</title>
		<content>                                       
LOWESTOFT is the most EASTERLY point of
Great Britain. The population is       
about 62,000. The fishing INDUSTRY is  
slowly declining and a lot of the      
trawlers are used as standby ships for 
the oil rigs. It is a small seaside    
town busy in the summer. There is a new
shopping centre where Queen Elizabeth  
and Prince Phillip will be  visiting   
soon . The present shopping precinct   
was created when the traffic was       
diverted to a new one-way traffic      
system. The town is divided by Lake    
Lothing and access to either north or  
south Lowestoft can only be gained via 
either  of  two road bridges, one at   
Oulton Broad and the other in Lowestoft
itself. In the summer months           
especially, traffic tends to build up  
at these bottlenecks causing much delay
and inconvenience to everyone.         </content>
