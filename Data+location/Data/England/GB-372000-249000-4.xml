    The firm began in the 1930's with  
 the production of sprout and hop      
 picking machines.  A small part of the
 business is still devoted to the      
 production of spare parts, which are  
 exported as far as Africa and         
 Australia.  A land drainage machine   
 was then developed for both home and  
 export markets, but this has seriously
 declined with the removal of the      
 government's land drainage subsidy.   
                                       
      At present the company is        
 involved in the design and production 
 of a revolutionary recovery vehicle   
 for British Rail.  It is basically a  
 four wheel drive lorry chassis, which 
 is capable of travelling on roads,    
 rough terrain and railway tracks.
