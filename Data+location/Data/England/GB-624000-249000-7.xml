		<title>07Thomas Seckford- Benefactor.</title>
		<content> Thomas Seckford was undoubtably       
 Woodbridge's greatest benefactor. He  
 was a barrister and was appointed to  
 Mary Tudor's Court of Requests in     
 1560. He was a very powerful man and  
 also a successsful merchant.          
 The fortune which he ammassed was put 
 to very good use. He established the  
 almshouses in what is now Seckford St.
 in 1587 and they still flourish today.
 They have a good income from property 
 owned in London and have recently been
 able to build new accomodation. There 
 is also an extensive modernisation    
 programme for the older cottages.     
 The Trust also helps local Schools and
 their pupils. University entrants can 
 apply for equipment grants towards the
 cost of books, etc.                   
 Thomas Seckford died in 1587 and is   
 buried in his private chapel in St.   
 Mary's Church.    D.W.(St.Mary's)     </content>
