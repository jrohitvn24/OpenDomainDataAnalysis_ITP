		<content> THE GRIMSTEADS.                       
 This area consists of two villages and
 some scattered dwellings set in       
 surroundings of wooded countryside,   
 secluded pasture and open farmland.   
 The Grimsteads, East and West,        
 comprise mainly of modern housing.    
 Neither village has any shops, post   
 offices, or public houses, though     
 both have churches and village halls. 
 There is a school and a chapel at West
 Grimstead. The small recreation ground
 at West Grimstead is used as a        
 playground by the school. The main    
 part of the village is situated on the
 West Dean to Alderbury road. The      
 distance between the Grimsteads is    
 approximately two miles.
