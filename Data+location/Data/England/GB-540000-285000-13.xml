		<content> Monday morning I reluctantly roll out 
 of bed at 7.30.  I wash, dress and    
 have breakfast. Mum cooks me bacon and
 eggs.  At 8.00 I make my bed and clean
 my teeth.  Half an hour later my      
 school bag is packed and I am ready to
 walk to school.  It takes about 10    
 mins. and I have to be there by 8.55. 
 At 9.00 the whistle blows and we walk 
 into school.  Morning school begins   
 with an assembly where we sing hymns, 
 say prayers and listen to a talk by   
 our Headmaster.  The we have any      
 notices concerning future events in   
 our school.  We look smart in our     
 school uniform, which consists of a   
 grey skirt, a white blouse, striped   
 tie and grey cardigan.  The boys wear 
 the same colours but have  long       
 trousers and jumpers.  After Assembly,
 work begins.                          
                                       </content>
