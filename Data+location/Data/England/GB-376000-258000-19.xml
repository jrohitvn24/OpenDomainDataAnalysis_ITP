		<title>19A DAY AT KINLOSS SCHOOL</title>
		<content> When I get up at 7.30pm I make my bed 
 and have thirty minutes to wash and   
 go to breakfast: cornflakes, orange   
 juice yoghurt and toast. Then we have 
 bedroom inspection. We must have clean
 shoes and a tidy bed area.            
 After inspection we have assembly at  
 9.00am whenour headmaster talks about 
 world affairs and asks our opinions.  
 At 9.10am we have lessons three       
 before break, two before lunch, which 
 is at 1.00pm and two after lunch.     
 After school, at 3.25pm we have a     
 choice of: going to the sports centre 
 for cricket or badminton, doing wood  
 work or cookery; or swimming or tennis
 in the school grounds.                
 After activities we eat at 5.30, and  
 at 6.30 we do prep for 45 minutes.    
 After prep we have free time, watch TT
 or use the computers until bed time at
 9.05. Lights out is at 9.30 pm.       </content>
