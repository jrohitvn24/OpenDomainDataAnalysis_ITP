		<title>18Life in Wall Heath [1]</title>
		<content>My name is Lee Knowles.I am 13 years   
old and I am 5 foot 3.I have a sister  
called Zena who is 10.My mom is called 
Maureen and my dad is called Graham.He 
works for West Midlands Gas in         
Birmingham.We used to live in          
Stourbridge but four years ago we moved
to Wall Heath.We have two cars,a W reg 
Allegro and an A reg Maestro which is  
metallic green.We have a push button   
telephone, a colour television and a   
Vic 20 computer.I do not shop in       
Kingswinford but in Stourbridge because
there is a wider range of shops.I      
support Stourbridge Football and       
Cricket teams.There is one thing I do  
not like about Kingswinford and that is
the leisure facilities.All we have is a
bowling green and that does the        
youngster a lot of good! My favourite  
programmes are Cricket Test Match on TV
and Breakfast Show on Beacon Radio.    </content>
