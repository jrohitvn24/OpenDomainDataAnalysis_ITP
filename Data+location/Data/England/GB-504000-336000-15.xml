		<title>15THE A52 ROAD NEAR NEWTON.</title>
		<content> This road has not been up-dated to    
 deal with the heavy container lorries 
 which pass along it between the East  
 Coast ports and the Midlands.It twists
 and undulates and is very narrow so   
 that overtaking is both difficult and 
 dangerous.Nor is the road surface     
 strong enough to stand the weight and 
 frequent repairs have been necessary  
 during the past 5 years.There is no   
 lay-by,no cafe and no garage on this  
 section so the only impact that the   
 traffic has on the area is that of    
 inconvenience to local road-users.Even
 the villages are far enough away not  
 to suffer from noise pollution!During 
 wet or snowy weather minor flooding   
 occurs on this section.In the summer  
 the traffic is increased by holiday-  
 makers.
