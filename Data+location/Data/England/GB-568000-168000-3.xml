		<title>03Housing &amp; Jobs in w. Strood</title>
		<content> This part of Strood, bordered to the  
 north by the A2 and to the south-west 
 by the M2, is strictly residential.   
 The housing estates have gradually    
 been added, many in the last thirty   
 years, to cater for the growing       
 population of the Medway Towns. The   
 housing varies in quality, from some  
 depressed areas to some relatively    
 expensive estates. This part of Strood
 is less densely populated than those  
 to the east, towards the centre of    
 Rochester. Almost all houses in the   
 area have small gardens.              
 There is very little employment within
 this area. The vast majority drive or 
 use bus services into the Medway Towns
 to work.
