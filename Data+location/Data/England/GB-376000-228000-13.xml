		<content>  Our village school is in School      
 Crescent, Corse. There are 89 children
 and 5 teachers. Mr Evans is the       
 Headmaster and Mrs Williams is the    
 Deputy Head. There are 4 classrooms.  
 The Infant room was built in 1871 and 
 the other classrooms are in Terrapin  
 buildings which were built in 1972    
 when Staunton Schol closed and 34 from
 Staunton to Corse. Children come to   
 our school when they are 4 and leave  
 at 11. Most children then go to Newent
 Comprehensive School. We do all the   
 usual lessons like Maths, English,    
 Scripture, History, Geography, Science
 and Games. Boys play football and     
 cricket and the girls play rounders   
 and netball. We go to camp for a week 
 in summer and we go to interesting    
 places. At Christmas we do a concert  
 in the village hall.
