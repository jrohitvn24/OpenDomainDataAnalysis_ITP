		<content>  Mr Fallon is a{Senior Dental Officer,
 and he is the only one at the{Ashby   
{Health Centre}in Scunthorpe. His      
 priorities are{schools, pre-schools   
 and{handicapped children.             
  He sees from 25 to 75 patients a day.
 He visits 26 schools a year and says  
 these examinations are generally      
 followed up by the parents.           
  People attend the clinic regularly.  
 According to Mr Fallon, children's    
 teeth in this area are generally very 
 healthy. This is mainly due to the    
{fluoridated water}in the area.        
  Mr Fallon thinks the clinic is better
 than it was five years ago, but he    
 could still do with more equipment. He
 also feels that another full-time     
 dentist would be a good idea.
