		<title>11Bed Time</title>
		<content> I start getting ready for bed at about
 8 o'clock. I go upstairs to my bedroom
 and get changed into my nighty. I then
 go to the bathroom to brush my teeth  
 and wash my face and hands. I then go 
 back downstairs and watch television  
 or play a game for about half an hour.
 At about 8.30 I go upstairs to bed. I 
 sleep in the same bedroom as my       
 brother Vincent. Before going to sleep
 Vincent chooses a book for me to read 
 to him. He likes me reading all sorts 
 of adventure stories to him like 'The 
 Enchanted Wood' and 'The Magic Faraway
 Tree'. I read for about 30 minutes    
 then I get into my own bed and talk   
 for a short time and then I go to     
 sleep.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
