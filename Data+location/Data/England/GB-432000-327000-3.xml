		<title>03FARMING IN TWYFORD</title>
		<content> Rapeseed was one of the main crops    
 that hade been planted.There was lots 
 of cows on rough grazing land.We fount
 out that there were two different     
 shapes of bales.                      
 One kind of bales were round and      
 other                                 
 kinds were rectangular bales. There   
 were some cultiuated land behind the  
 farms,with no cows on it.One of the   
 farms had very old machinery that were
 pulled by horses.                     
 The second farm had a dog and new     
 machinery, including a combine        
 harvester which was probably used by  
 the other farms.We noticed a goose in 
 one of the farms.Another farmer oned a
 bull a long time ago that killed a boy
 of 15.Some of the land which we saw   
 were not owned by farmers in          
 twyford.One of the farmers had a      
 couple of tractors.                   </content>
