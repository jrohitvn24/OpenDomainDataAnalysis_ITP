 COAL HAS BEEN MINED IN THE FOREST OF  
 DEAN SINCE PRE-ROMAN TIMES. UNTIL THE 
 19TH CENTURY ALL MINES WERE SHALLOW OR
 DRIFT MINES. THE LAST NATIONAL COAL   
 BOARD DEEP MINE CLOSED IN 1965 BUT    
 INDIVIDUALLY OWNED DRIFT MINES ARE    
 STILL WORKED BY FREEMINERS.           
                                       
 TO BE A FREEMINER YOU HAVE TO LIVE    
 WITHIN THE 'HUNDRED OF ST BRIAVELS'.  
 ALSO YOU HAVE GOT TO WORK AT THE COAL 
 FACE FOR A YEAR AND A DAY &amp; OBTAIN    
 PERMISSION.                           
                                       
 AT CANNOP  MINE 14 MEN ARE EMPLOYED.  
 THE MINE SHAFT SLOPES STEEPLY DOWN    
 INTO THE HILLSIDE. 3 MEN ARE DOWN THE 
 MINE AT ONE TIME. THE MINERS USE      
 EXPLOSIVES TO BREAK UP THE COAL DOWN  
 INSIDE THE MINE.  CONT. PAGE 6...     </content>
