		<title>01GAZETTEER - S.E. WIRKSWORTH</title>
		<content> THE AREA IS MAINLY RURAL, WITH A GREAT
 DEAL OF MIXED FARMING. THE SOUTHERN   
 PENNINES PLAY A MAJOR ROLE CREATING   
 HILLS AND VALLEYS THAT ARE STEEP AND  
 NOT SUITABLE FOR MAJOR CROP           
 PRODUCTION.                           
 WIRKSWORTH IS THE TOWN IN THE AREA    
 THAT PROVIDES MOST OF THE SHOPPING    
 FACILITIES.                           
 THE QUARRIES TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA 
 ARE THE SOURCE OF INDUSTRY FOR THE MEN
 ALONG WITH FARMING AND LORRY DRIVING. 
 A FEW LIGHT INDUSTRIES AND LOCAL GOV. 
 ALSO EMPLOY MANY PEOPLE. CLOTHING     
 MANUFACTURE PROVIDES A LOT OF         
 PART-TIME WORK FOR WOMEN.             
 LOCAL DERBYSHIRE DIALECT IS QUITE     
 STRONG. G IS SOUNDED ON THE END OF    
 WORD. H IS DROPPED BUT RARELY ADDED.  
 FARMLAND, TREES, HOUSING AND THE      
 TUNNEL FOR THE CARSINGTON RESERVOIR   
 ARE THE THINGS THAT STAND OUT.        </content>
