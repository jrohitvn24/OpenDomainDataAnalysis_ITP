		<content>  In the area where we live most of the
 streets are{littered}with paper,cans  
 etc.Some people like the place to look
 nice and tidy but others don't care   
 and just throw things on the floor and
 the area is spoiled. People put their 
 bags of rubbish in the entries and    
 dogs and cats open them then they     
 start to smell.There are quite a few  
{derelict houses}around too.Most of    
 these{houses}are old and are being    
 modernised,but as they are being      
 modernised and new windows are being  
 put in youths often come and smash the
 windows so they have to be replaced.  
 All the{litter}in the streets and the 
{houses}with broken windows make the   
 area look untidy and would make some  
 people think it was a rough place,so  
 they wouldn't want to come around     
{Kirkdale}to buy property or visit     
 here. {(Lisa Moore)                   </content>
