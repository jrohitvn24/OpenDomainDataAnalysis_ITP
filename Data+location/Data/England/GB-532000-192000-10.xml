		<title>10LIFE IN MY STREET</title>
		<content> My street is called Rylston Road. It  
 is not very big, the houses are all   
 terraced, which means they are all    
 joined together. In the mornings my   
 street is quite busy with mums taking 
 children to school. There are lots of 
 cars down my street; most of the      
 people park their cars along the      
 curb,some park their cars in their    
 garages. This causes a problem for the
 milk man because he can't park his    
 float in the kerb. We also have a post
 man who comes to our street at about  
 8.15 a.m.                             
 In the evening some children play     
 on their bikes. A few of us play      
 games.Some of these games are called  
 it,123 and sticky toffee. A few of us 
 bring out card games called Top       
 trumps. This is what it is like to    
 live in my street.
