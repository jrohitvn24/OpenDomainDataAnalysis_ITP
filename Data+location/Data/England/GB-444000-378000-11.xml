		<title>11A Killamarsh Nurse</title>
		<content> Nurse Robinson came to our school and 
 talked about her job.She has a lot of 
 work to do in her job.She starts work 
 at a quarter to nine and leaves at    
 half past four.In her job she mostly  
 checks children's eyes.Nurse Robinson 
 goes to 16 schools and sees over 4000 
 children.She likes her job very much  
 and has been a nurse for twenty two   
 years.She has to wear a uniform and it
 is a blue dress,black coat and a blue 
 and black hat.She knows 30 other      
 nurses in this area and she had to    
 train for four years to become one.She
 comes into St. Giles school every two 
 weeks usually on a Tuesday.In any one 
 day she has to visit two different    
 schools.I think Nurse Robinson is a   
 kind and understanding person who does
 a difficult job.I am glad we have a   
 nurse to look after all our problems.
