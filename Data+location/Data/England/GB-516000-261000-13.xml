		<title>13SURVEY ELECTRICAL</title>
		<content> We think ours is the Age of Technology
 or the Micro-Chip era so we decided as
 a class with the help of our teacher  
 to carry out a survey of all the      
 electrical and electronic gadgets that
 we have access to. This doesn'nt mean 
 we know how they all work but we learn
 about a lot of them from our teacher  
 Mr. Burgess.Sometimes we can take them
 apart but never get them back together
 again but Sir doesn't mind.           
  The Reception Class gave us their    
 answers but they voted with their     
 friends and didn't know what we meant 
 by some of our questions.We haven't   
 counted their results but we are      
 keeping those answers for fun.We had  
 to work out the percentages on the    
 blackboard but after a while we used  
 the pocket calculator after estimating
 the answers.
