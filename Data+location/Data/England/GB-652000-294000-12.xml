		<title>12BELLE VUE PARK - LOWESTOFT</title>
		<content>The entrance to Belle Vue Park is from 
the Ravine. It is a park and gardens   
joined to the Sparrows Nest.           
At the top of the gardens is a war     
memorial surrounded by three cannons.  
The memorial is the Lowestoft Naval    
Memorial. The names are arranged       
according to year of death and rank.   
The memorial was built, and is         
maintained, by the Commonwealth        
War Graves Commission. There are       
approximately 2,584 men's names on     
the memorial who were lost at sea      
and who have no graves. There is       
also a slab on the floor which has     
37 names on and they are people who    
died on the land. The Iron Bridge      
that is in the park was presented by   
William Youngman, 1st. Mmayor          
of Lowestoft, to commemorate the       
jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria.
