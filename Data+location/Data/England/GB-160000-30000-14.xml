		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MATTHEW</title>
		<content> We can use the computer just for games
 but some discs have maths and problems
 which we have to solve.               
 It's dinner time at twelve - school   
 dinners are 65p a day, but I have a   
 packed lunch which my Mum makes in the
 morning.  After dinner we go out to   
 play and today it's my turn to play   
 tennis in the hall.  We use plastic   
 bats and a foam ball because it's     
 inside.                               
 Back to the classroom and it's reading
 and project work for another hour and 
 then we're off out into the sunshine  
 for a game of rounders.  It's a great 
 game because you have to be sharp and 
 fast.  We go home exhausted and as    
 soon as I get home I get changed from 
 my school uniform and put jeans and my
 army jumper on.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
