 in the first house in Stoney Close.Our
 house is a semi-detached house.It used
 to be Council house but now we have   
 bought it.There are five people in my 
 family:my mummy and daddy,my gran and 
 my elder sister Jillian,who is fifteen
 My dad works as a man who repairs     
 houses and things.My mum works for a  
 lady called Mrs. Johns. Occasionally  
 my sister works at the Dunkery        
 Hotel which is next to us.Sometimes on
 Sundays we go out to together for a   
 walk usually on the Moor. Every Sunday
 we go to church in Minehead because we
 are Catholics.When we come home we all
 have breakfast together. We go for    
 holidays together but we have never   
 been further than Plymouth.
