 calves some cake and give them some   
 hay and cereal. After I have had my   
 breakfast I go over the road with Dad 
 to give the bullocks some hay . Then  
 we go back home and Dad does some     
 muck-spreading."                      
   Lynne: "I live at 2, Sixbells,      
 Westbury-on-Severn. You can see the   
 river from the top of Wintles Hill. I 
 live in a semi-detached house and we  
 are having an extension built on the  
 back of it. It is called Sixbells     
 because you can see the Westbury      
 church spire with six bells in it.    
 There are fields at the back of the   
 house and a playing field, hall and   
 cricket ground opposite us. There is  
 a farm over the main road and up      
 Wintles Hill there are a few houses   
 and two bus stops."
