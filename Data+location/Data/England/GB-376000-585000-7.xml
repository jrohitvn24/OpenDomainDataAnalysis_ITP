		<title>07The garage, Greenhaugh</title>
		<content> 50 years ago Greenhaugh had a busy    
 blacksmith's shop which shod the farm 
 horses and kept the farm machinery    
 working. With the demise of the farm  
 horse this closed. In 1980 it was     
 converted to the requirements of a    
 modern motor repair business. It is a 
 one man business with only occasional 
 help and now has a comprehensive      
 collection of tools. His speciality is
 Citroen, but he can service and repair
 all kinds of vehicles including farm  
 machinery. Customers come from as far 
 away as Otterburn, Wark and Kielder.  
 The garage certainly fills a local    
 need and is always busy. Perhaps      
 ironically he is keeping the wheels   
 rolling as did his predecessor the    
 bkacksmith. The power however is motor
 not horse.
