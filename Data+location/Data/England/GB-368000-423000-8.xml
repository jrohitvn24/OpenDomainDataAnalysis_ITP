		<title>08Small Businesses in Darwen</title>
		<content>{  Frank Millington}came to Darwen in  
 the early 1970's to make{plastic      
{mouldings}- it seemed 'the business of
 the future';there were few{plastics   
 firms in Darwen.                      
   Many firms had moved to Darwen      
 because{low rates}were offered after  
 the decline of the{cotton}industry;   
 most firms today seem to be set up by 
 local people.                         
   He has had an{electronics}firm but  
 now has a{paint and stripping}business
 in{Premier Mill,}manufactures{picture 
{frames}and high quality{wooden toys   
 and executes{pyrography}on wood.He has
 always used{old mills}for premises.   
   Better grants would be available to 
 him on Merseyside but{aid}does go to  
 those who set up in old mills.        
   Despite heavy paperwork,he believes 
 that smallfirms have a future due to  
 low overheads.                        </content>
