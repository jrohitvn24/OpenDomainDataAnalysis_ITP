		<title>12A DAY IN HARVEST</title>
		<content>My husband rises at 6.00am he brings me
a cup of tea in bed at 7.00am. I get-up
at 7.30am bath, make the beds and tidy 
the upstairs of the house. I have my   
breakfast alone, my husband and son    
having had theirs earlier before the   
men arrive at 7.30am. There is usually 
several telephone messages to take     
during breakfast. During harvest my son
aged 23, drives one of the combines so 
his meals have to be packed for the day
he has 'nineses', a snack consisting of
a sandwich and a flask of tea, then    
lunch and tea. My husband comes home   
for lunch, usually a cold meal.        
This morning I went to Bury St. Edmunds
shopping being Market Day is very busy.
Found a parking space, bought bacon,   
coffee and sausages at the Grocer's,   
back to car, then to the market to buy 
fruit, tomatoes, cucumber and fish and 
finished shopping at the Supermarket.  </content>
