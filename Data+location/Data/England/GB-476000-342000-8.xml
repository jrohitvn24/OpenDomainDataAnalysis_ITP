		<title>08The population of the area</title>
		<content> The poulation of the area is small and
 each of the 4 villages have a mixture 
 of age and social class.Alverton is   
 the smallest with 20 residents,       
 Flawborough has approx.40.Shelton has 
 between 50 and 100 and Thoroton about 
 the same.There is sprinkling of       
 children in each village who are      
 educated outside the area.There are   
 also retired people in the villages   
 although many of them part-time work  
 to supplement their pensions.The      
 working population is equally split   
 between those who work in the area    
 mainly in farming and those who       
 commute to work in professions in the 
 town.The pop. is more floating than it
 used to be as locally based industry  
 is negligable therefore the passing   
 need for tied farm cottages no longer 
 applicable these properties are being 
 made available for commuting workers. </content>
