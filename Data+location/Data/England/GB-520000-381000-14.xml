  When we arrived at the show I went   
 and walked the Nursery Stakes Course. 
 The Nursery Stakes is where you ride  
 your horse round a jumping course.The 
 jumps are about 2 feet high.          
   First of all I jumped round the     
 jumps and I had a clear round.I then  
 went round on my brother's pony.I     
 again had a clear round and went into 
 the jump-off.This is where you jump   
 the course against the clock.         
   First I went round on my brothers   
 pony and went into the lead.Then I    
 went round on my pony and came        
 second.I won it on Tim's pony.I went  
 in to collect my rosette,after        
 receiving it I cantered round the     
 ring.I gave Tim,my brother,his pony   
 back.I put my pony in the horse-box   
 and then waited for Tim.
