		<title>04Frogmore Nature Reserve</title>
		<content>In Chalgrove we have a big field, we   
call it Frogmore. Archeologists found a
medieval manor site there;now that has 
been covered by a football pitch. The  
rest of the field has been made into a 
nature reserve.                        
  We have made camps out of wood and   
mats also we climb the trees that grow 
all round.   We have set mouse traps   
because we want to study mice.         
  Starlings, blackbirds, thrushes, blue
tits, coal-tits and mallard have nested
there; many more types of bird feed and
visit.                                 
  A pond was dug this year, but the    
water does not stay in it, we hope to  
line it with clay to make it water-    
tight. Then it will be a safe home for 
the frogs, newts and toads that also   
live in the surrounding ditches.
