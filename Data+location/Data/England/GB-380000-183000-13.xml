 7.oo a.m.After I have washed and      
 dressed I make breakfast for my mother
 and my sister, her name is Amelia she

 cereals and toast. My mother takes my 
 sister and I by car to school,there is
 no direct bus route.                  
 I then play with my friends in the    
 playground until school starts at
