		<title>20Basic Needs Oakley lacks</title>
		<content> The area's only shop sells mainly{food
 stuffs and is used as a convenience   
 for odd items. Most housewives travel 
 weekly to{supermarkets in Basingstoke 
 where there are lower prices, wider   
 choice and the convenience of shopping
 trolleys and free car parks.{Clothing 
 and other basic needs are bought in   
{Basingstoke's town centre shops.      
                                       
 While local{Infant and Junior Schools 
 provide education for children aged 5 
 to 11 years, there is no school for   
 older children. Oakley children up to 
 16 years are bused by the Local       
 Education Authority to Cranbourne     
{Comprehensive School}in Basingstoke.  
 Kempshott children attend one of 3    
 comprehensive schools - Cranbourne,   
 Richard Aldworth or Brighton Hill. As 
 the journey is less than 3 miles, no  
 transport is provided.                </content>
