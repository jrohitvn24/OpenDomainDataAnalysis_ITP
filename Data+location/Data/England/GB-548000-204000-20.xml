		<content> We saw 3 disused bomb shelters down   
 church Lane. They were shaped like a  
 50 pence piece. Two were above ground 
 and one was half buried and flooded   
 with water. They each had four littl  
 square windows where guns were poked  
 through during world war two. In      
 Church Lane there is a machine gun    
 post and also inside the Radio        
 Station. There are German machine     
 bullets in one of the hangar doors.   
 One of the remaining buildings on the 
 airfield was the hospital. It still   
 has a red cross beneath the window.
