		<title>15  QUARRIES</title>
		<content>                                       
 In our area there are two quarries.   
 One is called{Ure Valley Aggregates}  
 Ltd and the other is called{R.W.Potter
{(Limestone) L.T.D}at Potgate.They both
 do the same sort of work.When you     
 start a quarry you take the top soil  
 off and store it in large heaps which 
 are kept for restoration then the     
 gravel is exposed.You dig it out with 
 a dragline which is put into a dump   
 truck and taken to a separating plant 
 which separates the sand from         
 gravel.The sand is washed and goes on 
 one pile.The gravel goes through a    
 grading screen which separates it into
 different sizes 10mm,14mm,20mm,40mm   
 which also goes onto separate piles   
 which in turn are loaded onto lorries 
 with a loading shovel.To run a quarry 
 you need 6 men depending on the size  
 of the unit.                          </content>
