		<content> Melton Mowbray is well served by a    
 large variety of shops in the compact 
 town centre. A shopping precinct is in
 the process of being constructed based
 around the old Corn Exchange. Further 
 developments planned are for several  
 large supermarkets both in the town   
 centre &amp; on the outskirts of the town.
                                       
 There are also other small shops and  
 small shopping areas in other parts   
 of the town.
