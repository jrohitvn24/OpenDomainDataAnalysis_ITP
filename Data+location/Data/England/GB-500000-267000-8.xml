		<content> In Yelden recently an area of 1 acre  
 adjacent to the church yard has been  
 leased as a playing field for the sum 
 of Â£100 per. annum. Villagers raised  
 the money for this from holding a     
 cheese and wine party and an old tyme 
 dance.                                
 This summer a small fete was held on  
 the field which included such games   
 as: throwing a ballon full of water   
 and seeing how many marbles one could 
 get in an upturned flower pot using a 
 spoon. there was also a rounders match
 between the children and the adults.  
 Â£105 was raised for use by the playing
 fields association. The Parish Council
 Amenities Committee have recently     
 allotted Â£100 per year to the playing 
 field.                                
 Other activities incclude darts and   
 skittles in the village pub. The      
 village hall can be hired for dances. </content>
