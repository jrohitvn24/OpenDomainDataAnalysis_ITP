		<content> The pub at Ralegh's Cross provides a  
 social centre for the area. Meals are 
 provided and it is open for morning   
 coffee (40p a cup - a very good coffee
 served in willow pattern cups).       
 There is also a small amount of       
 accomodation. The pub has been        
 modernised and appears to be very     
 popular with both the locals and with 
 tourists. I didnt see a stittle alley,
 dart board or snooker table.          
 The food looked good, golden scampi   
 and chips for Â£3.95, Â£2.15 for cod and
 chips and 75p for strawberries and    
 cream.                                
 In the field next to the pub at       
 Ralegh's Cross there used to be an    
 open air market and a sheep fair every
 autumn. However this was last held in 
 1984 as the demand for it fell off and
 sheep are now sent to the larger      
 markets such as that in Taunton.      </content>
