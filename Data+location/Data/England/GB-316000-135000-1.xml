		<title>01Quantock South - Great Wood</title>
		<content> This is an area of a forested         
 woodland, chiefly coniferous.  In the 
 Quantock Hills, some deciduous species
 chiefly Oak are present.  The hills   
 reach to 100 feet at "Wills Neck".    
 Steep sided valleys cut by streams run
 off to the North East.  Deer graze the
 area, as do horses turned loose by    
 farmers on the moorland.  Stags are   
 hunted by the Quantock Sta Hound Hunt.
  This is controversial as is the      
 Quarry at Triscombe.  the somerset    
 education authority run an Outdoor    
 education Centre at Great Wood.  There
 is also a small private school.  the  
 whole area is used for varied         
 recretional purposes, orienteering, as
 in quantock orienteers, walking,      
 horse-riding, motorbike scrambling,   
 environmental studies and picnicing.  
 The forest commision encourage        
 responsible usage of their area.      </content>
