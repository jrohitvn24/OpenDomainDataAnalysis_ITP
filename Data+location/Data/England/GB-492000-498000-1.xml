		<title>01Moorland south of Flask Inn</title>
		<content> Predominantly high open heather       
 moorland with a large area of conifer 
 plantation in the south east and some 
 woods in the north.  There is some    
 farming, mainly grazing, and mainly in
 the north west.  There is a garage,   
 cafe, pub, and caravan sites in the   
 North West to serve the main A169 and 
 the tourists.  this area is quite     
 popular with tourists because of its  
 lack of development, impressive       
 moorland scenery, and ease of access. 
 Many people stop along the parking    
 areas on the road to go walking or    
 admire the views.  The caravan sites  
 also have easy access to the popular  
 Robin Hoods Bay area.  Residents of   
 the block  are few but are either     
 involved in farming or the services   
 near the road.  Grouse shooting and   
 bee-keeping may be another activity of
 the moors on a small scale.           </content>
