		<title>17 - CHURCHES IN THE AREA  (2)</title>
		<content>  In the grounds of St. Michael's      
 School, Burton Park is Burton Church. 
 It is the smallest complete church in 
 Sussex and has a norman font. The     
 herringbone masonary is 800 years     
 old and the screen has stood since    
 the 15th century. There is a monument 
 to Sir John Goring of 1520, a former  
 owner of Burton Park House, together  
 with a brass of Lady Elizabeth Goring 
 (died 1558) who is wearing over her   
 dress an ornate coat covered with     
 heraldic designs.                     
  St. Agatha's at Coates was built     
 in 1100, with alterations in the      
 13th century. It has a plain Norman   
 Chancel arch, a norman window in the  
 nave and a norman font. The timbered  
 porch was added in the 16th century.  
 The rector is Rev. Ronald Johnson from
 Sutton Rectory, services are held at  
 8:00 am or 11:15 am on Sundays.       </content>
