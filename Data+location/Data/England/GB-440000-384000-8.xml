		<content> We went to Ballifield School to       
 interview the youngsters about the    
 games they play at break. The age     
 group was 5-7 years.                  
 Katie, a 6 year old, liked playing    
 hopscotch,skipping and kiss catch.    
 When she was asked if she knew any    
 game rhymes she answered,             
 "The big ship sails through the alli  
 -alli- o"                             
  David, a 5 year old, liked playing   
 football and pulling, which is a game 
 like tug of war in which the strongest
 stays standing up. When he was asked  
 if he knew any game rhymes he         
 answered, "No, they're for girls."    
  Chris, a 5 year old, liked playing   
 ball games like football.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
