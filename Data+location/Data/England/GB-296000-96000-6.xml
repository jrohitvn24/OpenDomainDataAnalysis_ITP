		<content> Quite a lot of types of{Transport}use 
 this area and there are some which you
 are not likely to find in the middle  
 of London like tractors usually use   
 the road.Most people have a car around
 here.I think a car is the best peice  
 of transport to have here because lots
 of people work in Exeter and it is    
 cheaper by car than by bus.Also       
 Broadclyst isn't well served by public
 Transport.The only good road systems  
 around here are the Motorway and the  
 main road to Exeter.Most people's Mums
 and Dads have a car.                  
                                       
 To drive a car you need a key to turn 
 it on,3 pedals (an accelerator,a      
 clutch and a brake),a gear stick to   
 change gear and a steering wheel to   
 steer it with.
