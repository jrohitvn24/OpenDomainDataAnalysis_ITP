		<content>  Regent street is the main shopping   
 street. Recently it has been made into
 a traffic-free pedestrian precinct.   
 Some people can remember when trams   
 ran up and down it.The street has been
 paved,sitting areas built and trees   
 planted.There are always crowds of    
 people here. This week a demonstration
 for 'animal liberation' was held,and  
 this year there have been cash        
 collections for striking coal-miners  
 and for Ethiopian famine relief,      
 drawings by pavement artists,and      
 break-dance exhibitions.              
 The Brunel centre is a new shopping   
 complex linked to Regent street.It has
 a domed glass roof over the main      
 concourse,with famous stores like     
 Boots,Sainsbury's,Mark's and Spencers 
 around it.A glass overhang shelters   
 the pavements ,with baskets of flowers
 suspended from it.                    </content>
