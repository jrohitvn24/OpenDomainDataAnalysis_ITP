		<title>17HALLATON: TORCH HOUSE 1</title>
		<content>  The{Torch Trust for the Blind}has its
 headquarters in Hallaton in the Hall, 
 formerly the home of the Bewicke      
 family. Its aim, as an interdenomin-  
 ational Christian charity, is to      
 provide Christian literature and      
 fellowship for visually handicapped   
 people. "The Torch" is a small        
 magazine first printed over 50 years  
 ago, and from that has developed the  
 present organisation which publishes  
 ten magazines, a wide range of        
 booklets, Scripture Union notes, all  
 available in braille, large print,    
 moon type and on compact cassette.    
 Torch House also operates a library   
 service, a Christian training scheme  
 for young visually handicapped people,
 and house parties - special weeks     
 through the year for the blind,       
 deaf/blind and their families.
