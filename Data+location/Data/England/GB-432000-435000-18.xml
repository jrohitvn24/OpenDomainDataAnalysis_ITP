		<content> The area of Roundhay is predominantly 
 middle class with a large section of  
 the populace holding skilled,         
 managerial or professional positions. 
 The occupations are diverse from      
 surveyor, accountant, teacher         
 journalist to well known television   
 personality Jimmy Savile who has his  
 home base in the vicinity of Roundhay 
 Park. Many of the wives resume work   
 once their children attend school,    
 and a greater proportion of these hold
 positions of equal status to their    
 husbands. There are numerous          
 businesses run from home, some        
 combined husband &amp; wife projects,     
 others by the wife alone, such as soft
 toy making and designer knitwear.     
 Across at Whinmoor the occupations for
 the males are mostly those of skilled 
 tradesmen and manual workers.
