		<content>  Our block is not a holiday centre    
 itself,but is close to the resorts of 
 Looe and Polperro where there are 7   
 large holiday camps and many guests   
 houses and hotels.                    
  The influx of visitors has an effect 
 on local life - prices are high,car   
 parking is difficult,heavy traffic on 
 inadequate roads slows movement       
 especially for commercial vehicles,   
 restrictions are often put on water   
 supplies,petty crime increases etc.   
  Few Pelynt people work in the        
 industry(8%) although many teenagers  
 work on a casual basis.There are 16   
 holiday flats or houses in the village
 but few B&amp;B's.                        
  A traffic count between 11-12a.m each
 day in the 3rd week of July showed 198
 vehicles from Looe,233 to Looe.This   
 compares with 76 from Looe and 59 to  
 Looe in November,1982.                </content>
