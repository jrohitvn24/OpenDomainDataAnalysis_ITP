		<title>05OLD KNACKER'S YARD _ BRISCO</title>
		<content> The old knacker's yard,which is still 
 in use,was built about 65 years ago.It
 is owned by the Dundas Chemical       
 Company,Dumfries.The grandfather of   
 Anne Gallagher,one of the children    
 working on this project,used to work  
 there just after World War II.        
 Nowadays it is used to humanely kill  
 farm animals which have been injured  
 in some way ,or are old or diseased.  
 Mr.Tommy Bird is the only person who  
 works there now and he lives in nearby
 Wreay.                                
          {*************}

 used to belong to Miss Linton who     
 owned Linton Tweed Mills,Shaddongate, 
 Carlisle.She used to breed Irish Wolf_
 hounds and show them at Cruft's.She is
 dead now and the house has been sold.
