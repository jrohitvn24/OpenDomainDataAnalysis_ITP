		<content> to see the beach and sea and some came
 to walk or swim.                      
 84% made no suggestions about         
 improving Bay. 4% said they wanted to 
 be allowed to go down the bank in     
 cars. 8% said they wished the beach   
 had more sand.                        
 Some of the residents are not too     
 happy about tourists in Bay because of
 all the noise children make and all   
 the litter they drop, especially in   
 the holiday season from about mid-June
 to about September.                   
 But the visitors are welcome in the   
 summer to buy souvenirs, such as      
 postcards, ships in bottles, presents 
 for relatives, pottery and perfumes to
 help them remember their holidays.    
 It is such an interesting village with
 its narrow cobbled streets and steps  
 to the tiny cottages.
