		<title>05WORK IN NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> Most people in the area were about    
 sixteen when they started work.Quite  
 a lot of people work outside of the   
 area,in Filton for example,and some   
 travel all over country. Not many     
 people are unemployed,but some women  
 class themselves as 'housewives',and a
 few work as childminders.People are   
 generally content with their jobs,and 
 some like them a lot.Quite a large    
 number are self-employed,and these    
 seem to enjoy being their own boss.   
 These include publicans,shopkeepers,  
 garage owners, and builders. A few    
 people have a university degree, and  
 on the whole they work in Bristol.    
 Quite a few of the women in the area  
 had several changes of jobs before    
 bringing up a family.
