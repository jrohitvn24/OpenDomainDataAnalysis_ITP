		<title>16The Pheasantry - Dunnington</title>
		<content> The Pheasantry is in the grounds of   
 Ragley Hall and is owned by a         
 syndicate of ten people who lease the 
 shooting rights from the Marquess of  
 Hertford. Mr. Ward, the gamekeeper,   
 buys day-old pheasant chicks in boxes 
 of 36 from a farm near High Wycombe.  
 They are housed in an ark and kept    
 warm (35C) with a paraffin heater. At 
 10 days the chicks are put into an ark
 with a pen. Plastic clips are fitted  
 to their beaks so that they cannot    
 pull feathers out of each other. As   
 the beaks grow quickly, Mr. Ward has  
 to trim them. After 7 weeks the clips 
 are removed and the birds released    
 into the woods. 1000 birds are        
 released into the 5000 acres around   
 Ragley Hall each year. The chicks are 
 fed on maize, wheat, vitamins and     
 powdered milk. Wild pheasants feed on 
 insects and grubs.                    </content>
