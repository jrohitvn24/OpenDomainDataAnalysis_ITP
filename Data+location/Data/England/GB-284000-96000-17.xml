 CARRIE BEALE AGED 11                  
  Yesterday I came to school at ten to 
 9 and I did some of{my ladybird       
{project.We then had playtime.}After   
 that we wrote a{letter to a boy called
{Ezekiel who lives in Kenya.} Our      
 school adopted him last year.         
  Then it was time for{packed lunch    
 which consisted of cheese and pickle  
 sandwiches, a raspberry yoghurt       
 and an apple.When we had finished we  
 did some of our{Domesday project work.
  We had to think of a{stall for our   
{school summer show.}Then we had       
 another playtime.Afterwards we went   
 swimming in{the new learner pool at   
{school}and then it was time to go     
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
