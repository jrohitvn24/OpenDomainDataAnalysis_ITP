		<title>20           FARMING</title>
		<content> Most local dairy farmers get up at six
o'clock and milk the cows using milking
machines,after that they have their    
breakfast.The machines need to be kept 
very clean to prevent contamination.   
A tanker comes every morning to collect
the milk,which is stored in a tank.The 
cowsheds,which get very dirty,have to  
be cleaned out and fresh bedding put   
down daily.The cows are milked again at
four p.m..Odd jobs need to be done like
fencing,building walls up,mending      
barns and collecting eggs,if they have 
hens.In winter cows feed on silage or  
hay.Ploughing is done in the Spring    
and haymaking in the Summer. Sometimes 
the farmer has to spray poison on weeds
and thistles in his fields. When a cow 
is going to have a calf the farmer may 
have to get up in the night to see if  
it is alright,if not he calls the vet  
for help.                              </content>
