 extremity of the city of Nottingham   
 covering the eastern third of the     
 grid.This area is covered by part of  
 the Bilborough council housing estate 
 and Wollaton Vale a private housing   
 estate.Half of the village of Strelley
 lies in the N.E area of the grid.The  
 remainder consists of the Parish of   
 Trowell whose village lies in the S.W 
 corner of the block.The majority of   
 the block is made up of agricultural  
 land with very little industry        
 anywhere in the block apart from some 
 small units and warehousing in the    
 Bilborough area.Bisecting the block   
 north to south is the M.1 motorway    
 containing the Trowell service        
 area.Running east to west along the   
 bottom third is the Nottingham to     
 Sheffield railway link and for NW to  
 SE the now disused Nottingham canal.  </content>
