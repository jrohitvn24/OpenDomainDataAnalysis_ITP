		<content> The main land cover of the Stubley    
 Hollow area of Dronfield was grass.   
 The second main land cover was houses.
 The third land cover was factories.   
 A lot of the factories were closed    
 down.                                 
    The houses were brick,stone or     
 brick and stone. Most of them were    
 semi detached.                        
    There was a small farm and also a  
 football club ground. We saw a petrol 
 station three bus stops,a letter box  
 and a telephone box.

 whitch was still open.                
    We saw a few offices. There was    
 also a gas sub station.
