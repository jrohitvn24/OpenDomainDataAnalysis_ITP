		<title>05STEVENAGE HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> In 1946 Stevenage was chosen as the   
 site for the first{New Town.}It was   
 between the 16th and 18th centuries   
 that the High Street began to look    
 as it does today.There is a nice      
 little street down the High Street    
 called Middle Row,the shops here have 
 been made up from stalls that used to 
 be there around the 14th and 15th     
 centuries.At the south end of the     
 High Street there are two churches    
 called Holy Trinity and The Methodist 
 Church and the Catholic and Baptist   
 churches are at the north end.        
  Between the 15th and 20th centuries  
 nearly every building in the High     
 Street has been or still is a pub     
 Today Stevenage Highstreet can meet   
 practically all needs for food,       
 clothing,household,garden and         
 motoring.In the past few years the    
 High Street has been modernised.      </content>
