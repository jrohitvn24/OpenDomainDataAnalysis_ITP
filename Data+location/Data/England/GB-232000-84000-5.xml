		<title>05      LOCAL  FARMING</title>
		<content> Around Launceston are scattered farms 
 ranging in size from 10{acres}to 400  
 acres.The land is hilly so there are  
 not vast areas of corn or other crops.
 Most farms are dairy,beef or sheep and
 a few are mixed.A typical dairy farm  
 is Bulsworthy with 130 acres covering 
 15 fields.They milk about 70 Friesian 
 cows 10 at a time in an{electrically  
{operated}milking parlour.Milk tankers 
 collect the milk and take it to the   
 Lifton Ambrosia factory for making    
 tinned creamed rice.Spring work is    
{fertilising}and{rolling}grass.In      
 Summer there is silage_making and cows
{calving}in Autumn.The cows are housed 
 indoors in Winter apart from feeding  
 at the{silage}pit,whilst sheep are    
 hired to crop the grass.The farmer has
 his own lorry transport for Launceston
 and Exeter markets as well as tractors
 and other farm machinery.             </content>
