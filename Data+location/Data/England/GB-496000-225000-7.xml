		<title>07CHILDREN'S GAMES, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> We talked to the children at the{Lower
{School}and they told us some of the   
 games they played at breaktime. The   
 games are varied. {Hopscotch, Horses  
{and Football}are popular though there 
 are no skipping games.  There is a    
{climbing frame}in the playground but  
 the children are only allowed on it if
 there is a teacher present. Games     
 lessons are mixed due to small        
 numbers. The sports played are        
{Netball, Hockey and Rounders.} After  
 school the children of Hockliffe play 
{Polo, Hide and Seek and Tag.}Some     
 children ride their bikes at the park.
 Others prefer to play on their        
 computers.  On Monday evenings, at the
 village hall, the{Youth Club}takes    
 place.  At the club you can{roller    
{skate, play snooker, breakdance}and   
{listen to records. }Once a week{ Cubs 
 and{Brownies}meet in the village.     </content>
