		<title>16A MOTHER'S DAY IN PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> We try to get up at 0700. I'm 1st into
 bathroom. Husband Phil starts break-  
 fast (laid the night before) while I  
 dress Peter, age 4. Meanwhile Rachel, 
 age 7, has wolfed breakfast &amp; she runs
 to school, late again. Phil has gone  
 to work &amp; Peter &amp; I finish our toast. 
 I then walk Peter to Playschool half a
 mile away, calling at the village shop
 on my return. Home to Radio 4, to tidy
 the kitchen &amp; bathroom, make beds &amp;   
 look for dirties. Another wash! Clean 
 out &amp; re-lay the fire. Collect Peter &amp;
 often a friend at 1145. Snack lunch,TV
 then take children for a walk. Deposit
 friend &amp; collect Rachel &amp; friend from 
 school. Prepare tea. Rachel goes to   
 Chess Club &amp; Phil is late. Children in
 bed by 2000. More washing-up! Collapse
 in heap for 30 mins before attacking  
 the dreaded ironing. Bed at 2300,     
 exhausted!                            </content>
