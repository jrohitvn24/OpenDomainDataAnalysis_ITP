		<title>19CROP DISTRIBUTION.</title>
		<content> Of the 108 whole or part, distinct,   
 fields in our allocated block, 5 were 
 devoted to pasture of either permanent
 or temporary type. The remainder were 
 equally divided between the growing of
 wheat, barley and oil seed rape. The  
 fields that are under pasture are     
 either in areas that are badly drained
 or where they are close to the stables
 or housing. Some of the fields are    
 devoted to the growing of plants for  
 gardens, but these are only those     
 right next to the garden centres. Many
 of the field boundaries have been     
 removed to make it easier for the     
 farmers to get their tractors across  
 their land. Most of the boundaries    
 dividing the roads from the fields    
 still exist however and contain many  
 wild flowers, the numbers of species  
 of which are low at the moment due to 
 recent council  spraying policies.    </content>
