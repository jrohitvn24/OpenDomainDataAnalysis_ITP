		<content> Most of the houses in this area are   
 lived in by their owners. The large   
 farm houses have been occupied by the 
 same family for several generations,  
 but the farmers are tenant farmers to 
 the Parham Estate. Kithurst farm was  
 completely rebuilt using old stone in 
 1912.                                 
 At each farm there are 2 to 6 tied    
 cottages, some of which are occupied  
 by farm workers and some of which are 
 occupied by retired workers from the  
 Parham Estate. The 3 houses in        
 Storrington in the area are large well
 equipped houses with large gardens.   
 Paygate cottage at Springhead has     
 recently been enlarged and added to.  
 Of the 24 Council houses in Amberley  
 included in this area. known as       
 Crossgated 12 are still owned by the  
 Council.
