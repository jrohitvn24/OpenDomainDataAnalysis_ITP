   The owner of Brundon Farm is Mr P

and the other for wheat,barley and     
sugarbeet crops.Mr Norman has 1 combine

after for other farmers and also some  
other animals like horses and chickens.
Mr Norman employs 2 men but his father 
employed 12 in 1943.  Some of the      
cottages around the farm date back to  
the first Domesday Book.  In 1943 you  
could get 1 ton of corn per acre and   
in 1985 you could get 2-3 tonnes an    
acre.    Mr Norman is Chairman of the  
Governors of Uplands Middle School and
