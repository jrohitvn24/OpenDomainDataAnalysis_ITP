		<title>19 Freetown</title>
		<content> Freetown is an area which is now      
 enclosed by the town of Bury but which
 at one time had an identity of its    
 own.                                  
                                       
 There are various theories to explain 
 the name of the area. It would seem to
 have started as a mill development    
 towards the end of the 18th century.  
 The land itself was unusual round here
 in that it was not owned by Lord Derby
 or the Church (glebe lands). This     
 seems the most likely reason for the  
 name. However some suggest that it the
 mills may well have had connections   
 through trade with the Freetown in    
 Sierra Leone.                         
                                       
 Nowadays the large mills have been    
 replaced by smaller industrial units  
 concentrating on distribution and     
 light industry.                       </content>
