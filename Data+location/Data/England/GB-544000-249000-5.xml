		<content> There is a recreation ground in Little
 Shelford, near the centre.This has    
 many useable facilities.In the summer 
 the council have a cricket pitch for  
 the villagers to use.They also have a 
 large bowling green and next to this  
 there are three tennis courts.As well 
 as these, they have swings and such   
 like next to the pavillion.           
   There are twenty seven shops in the 
 village,all very regulary used        
 including a Library, two Banks, a     
 Dentist,a Fishmonger and a Chemist and
 a Dairy.About fifteen years  ago      
 virtually all the shops would have    
 been private houses.
