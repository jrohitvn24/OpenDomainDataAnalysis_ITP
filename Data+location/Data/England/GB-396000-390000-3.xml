		<content> Talking to a Local Resident:          
                                       
 We spoke to Mrs. Wilson who lives in  
 one of the houses opposite the        
 Methodist church in Chisworth. She has
 lived in Chisworth all her life and   
 went to the Methodist Primary School  
 from the time she was five until      
 fourteen, when she went to work in the
 Holehouse Cotton Mill. She worked     
 there for 25 years, then it closed as 
 a cotton mill and re-opened as a      
 factory where they dyed carpets. In   
 1967 the mill was taken over by a     
 plastics and rubber firm. Mrs Wilson  
 worked at this mill for all these     
 firms until she retired at 60 years of
 age.                                  
 She is now 65 and is the caretaker for
 the The Methodist Youth Centre.
