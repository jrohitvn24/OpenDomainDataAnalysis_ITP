		<title>12"A Saturday"--Darras Hall</title>
		<content>   "I got up on Saturday at 7 o'clock.I
 played with my sister Gemma.We cut up 
 magazines and made a house with the   
 cut-outs. After about 2 hours Mum and 
 Dad got up but Dad had to go to work  
 because Barclays Bank open on         
 Saturdays.For breakfast we had bacon, 
 egg and beans. We went upstairs and I 
 got dressed in a T-shirt and skirt.   
        Then I went outside to ride my 
 bike. After that I made a model with  
 some cardboard boxes. Then I set the  
 table for lunch,we had salad. We went 
 to Grandmas and had some tea."

 "For breakfast I had cereal,sausage,  
 and toast. My lunch was lamb,potatoes,
 and peas. I used my computer for about
 an hour, then went in my bedroom to   
 play with my train-set.
