		<content> Baddesley Colliery lies in the        
 northern area of the Warwickshire     
 coalfield.The extent of the coalfield 
 is approximately 32km.long from       
 Tamworth in the north to Coventry in  
 the south,although bore holes have    
 proved there is a considerable        
 extension to the south of Daw Mill,   
 Coventry.At its widest extremity      
 around the Atherstone area it extends 
 to a width of 13km. The colliery's    
 output is 6000,000 tonnes per year    
 produced from four production units   
 all fully mechanised with powered     
 supports and face end mechanisation.  
 Coal has been mined in the Baddesley  
 area since the 15th.Century and on the
 present site since 1850.During the    
 first 100 years the colliery produced 
 high quality two yard coal,but at the 
 present time coal is being produced   
 from four narrower seams.             </content>
