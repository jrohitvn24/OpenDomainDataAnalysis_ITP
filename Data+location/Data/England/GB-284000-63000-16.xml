		<title>16Ring Road Census, Marldon</title>
		<content> This year people have been very       
 worried about the planned ring road.We
 went to see how much traffic uses the 
 road.                                 
 We did our census at 5 Lanes Junction.
 The most cars came from Paignton to   
 Torquay. We started at 11.05 and      
 finished at 11.35a.m. 316 cars came   
 from Torquay and 379 from Paignton,5  
 from Preston, 39 from Totnes and 2    
 from Compton. We sat on the ground and
 counted the vehicles. We went to the  
 junction on Mondays when the  Monday  
 Market was on.                        
 There were 10 times as many cars as   
 lories. Most traffic was from Paignton
 to Torquay, with nearly as much in the
 other direction, most of the time nose
 to tail. The next busiest was 5 Lanes 
 Road, then the road to Preston.The    
 road to Compton was hardly used at    
 all.                                  </content>
