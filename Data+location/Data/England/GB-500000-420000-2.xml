		<content>{THE HUMBER BRIDGE _ IMPACT ON BARTON  
   In July 1980 the final section of   
 deck was put in place making the      
 bridge the largest single span        
 suspension bridge in the world.       
   The new link with the North Bank has
 brought certain benefits to Barton by 
 bringing Hull's facilities into easy  
 reach.Another feature has been the    
 steady trickle of home buyers moving  
 from the North Bank to the less       
 expensive South.                      
   The expected boost to tourism and   
 industry has not lived up to          
 expectations although the potential   
 still remains.                        
   For the true Bartonians the bridge  
 has had little real impact although at
 the same time it has brought benefits 
 for those who want them without       
 spoiling the nature of the town.
