     Ten houses have not got mains     
water either because it costs a lot to 
be joined up to the mains or because   
they do not want to use water which has
been chemically treated.               
                                       
     Two houses have not got           
electricity.  The houses are very      
scattered and it costs over 2000 pounds
to link some of them to the grid.      
                                       
     Twenty-two houses have not got    
mains drainage because there is no     
large centre of population in Heathylee
so there is no sewage works.  Most     
houses have their own septic tank.
