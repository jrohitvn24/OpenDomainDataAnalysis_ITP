		<content> TEVERSHAM                             
 From a very small village Teversham   
 has grown a little in size because of 
 the housing need for workers in the   
 nearby Marshall's Group. A few        
 residents are agricultural workers on 
 the farm in the village, but many     
 residents now work at Marshalls or at 
 various businesses in Cambridge, a    
 very small proportion commute to      
 London each day.                      
    The residents on the 'Council'     
 estate within the City boundary work  
 in varied capacities in Cambridge     
 city.                                 
 The children of Fen Ditton and        
 Teversham are lucky enough to attend  
 their village primary schools. Leaving
 these at eleven years of age most     
 children living within this 'bloc'    
 continue education at Bottisham       
 Village College,two miles away.       </content>
