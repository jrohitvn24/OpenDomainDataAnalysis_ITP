		<title>16LIGHT INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> The change from reliance on heavy     
 industry to a more varied and lighter 
 base is now visible in{South Bank and 
{Grangetown.}The land needed for the   
 expansion of light industries has been
 obtained by the conversion of derelict
 land and the clearance of older       
 housing.These schemes form part of the
{Langbaurgh Councils}scheme for        
{industrial regeneration.}The scheme   
 was instituted to entice companies    
 from outside the area to set up in the
 Langbaurgh area and so bring          
 additional employment opportunities   
 into a{depressed area.}In order to    
 attract new industries into the area  
 the government and council offered    
 incentives to any firm taking up      
 units.Like other industrial estates in
 the Cleveland area ,a full occupancy  
 rate has not yet been achieved.
