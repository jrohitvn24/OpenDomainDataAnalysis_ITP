     In l984 a new Sports Centre for   
use by the general public was opened   
at Peers School.   During a typical    
week in March it was used by 333       
adults and 202 children.   A week in   
July saw it being used by 459 adults   
and 4l0 children.   We decided to find 
out what potential there was for more  
people to use it.   284 local people   
were interviewed.   94 were under l6,  
62 were aged l6-24, 64 were aged       
25-39, 37 were aged 40-50 and 27 were  
over 50. The ratio of male and female  
was equal. 52% did not know that there 
was a Sports Centre.   40% had         
received or seen publicity about the   
Centre.   78%  of those who did know   
about it had used it.   26% used it    
more than once a week, 30% about once  
a week and 22% once a month or less    
often.                                 </content>
