		<title>07The Bridge Inn, Bridgerule</title>
		<content>  The Bridge Inn was built in 1660. It 
 was built specifically as an Inn and  
 had its own brewery across the        
 cowyard. The brewery was later        
 converted into a skittle alley and    
 remained in this capacity until       
 recently when local people converted a
 room in the Inn into a bar and skittle
 alley. The original alley is now used 
 as a games room.                      
                                       
  The Inn has had many owners and after
 the second world war it was taken over
 by Whitbread Breweries who owned it   
 until 1970 when it went into private  
 ownership. It is now a free house and 
 has not only a good local trade but   
 serves bar meals and attracts good,   
 widespread custom and tourist trade.
