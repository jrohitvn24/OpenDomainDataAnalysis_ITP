		<content>     In 1985 Castle Carrock school,with
 3 teachers, had 55 pupils on its roll:
 17 from the village itself, 5 others  
 from the Talkin area, and the         
 remainder from the fellside villages  
 and farms outside the Doomesday study 
 area. Transport has to be provided by 
 the Local Education Authority.   Due  
 to the distances travelled, shool     
 dinners have to be provided.   At the 
 age of 11 all pupils have to travel to
 the senior school at Brampton.        
                                       
      For pre-school age children,     
 there is a playgroup, run mainly by   
 the parents, which meets three times a
 week in the Watson Institute.         
                                       
     The former village school in      
 Talkin has been converted to a centre 
 for Brownie holidays and weekends.
