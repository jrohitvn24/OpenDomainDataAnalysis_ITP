		<content>On 18 June when I'd just got up my mum 
called me to feed my calf Flash so I   
dressed, got his food ready, fed him, &amp;
put him in the field. Then I ran down  
the yard to see 53.She is ready to     
farrow today &amp; I am very excited.When I
got to the farrowing house I sat down  
by &amp; rubbed her belly.I thought to my- 
self I will see if she has any milk. I 
touched her teat &amp; all the milk came   
out &amp; it hit me on the face.I walked up
the yard &amp; went inside.During breakfast
I was thinking to myself,"How many will
she have?I think she'll have 12".It was
now 8.35 so I got ready for school jump
-ed over the gate &amp; crossed the road. I
met Stephen &amp; we put our bags in the   
classroom then went to the rabbit hutch
as the bell went.In class we did our   
write-up on ou5r trip to the Forest of 
Dean until the bell went for dinnertime
so I went home. (CONTINUED PAGE 16).   </content>
