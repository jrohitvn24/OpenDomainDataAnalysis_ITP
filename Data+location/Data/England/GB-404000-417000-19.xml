		<title>19A TYPICAL DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{My Day by Stacey Swann.}              
      On Friday mornings my Mum wakes  
 me up at 7.30. I get dressed and go   
 down stairs to have breakfast. I      
 usually have an egg. Then I have a    
 wash, clean my teeth, put on my shoes 
 and go out to play.                   
      At 8.25 I go for the bus. When it
 comes I get out my Saver Strip and pay
 my fare. I sit next to Samantha       
 Brooksbank and talk to her.           
      When I arrive at school I put my 
 bag by the gate and play rounders or  
 tig with my friends until the bell    
 goes at 9.00. Then we line up, go     
 into school a class at a time, and put
 our coats and bags in the cloak room. 
      Next we go into the classroom and
 get out our reading books. Our teacher
 takes the register and we give out the
 sum books. At 10.00 we have assembly, 
 we sing a song and listen to a story. </content>
