		<title>09PARTNEY SHEEP FAIR</title>
		<content> The Sheep Fair comes around to Partney
 every year on the 1st of August.      
 People come from all over the North of
 England to buy and sell sheep.They    
 start arriving at 4 o'clock in the    
 morning.The sheep come in great big   
 double decker lorries or some pulling 
 trailers.Its held in a field opposite 
 the school.Every year before it is    
 held I help them to put the fences up.
 It is very hard work keeping the      
 sheep in the pens and at the end we   
 have to get them back in the lorries. 
 The sheep fair has been here for      
 hundreds of years.Many years ago it   
 was bigger with market stalls and side
 shows.
