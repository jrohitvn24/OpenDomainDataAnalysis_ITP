		<title>03Static Caravans in Chapel</title>
		<content> In Chapel St.Leonards we have people  
 that come down and buy caravans,then  
 they keep them on the caravan         
 sites.Some people move their caravans 
 onto the grass behind the Village     
 Hall. People put their caravans behind
 the Village Hall during the summer    
 because it is nearer to the beach.The 
 holiday makers come from              
 Nottingham,Leeds,Scotland and         
 Sheffield.Sometimes they come at the  
 weekend and go back home the following
 weekend.Some people buy their caravans
 in the winter and then they come down 
 in Spring or the beginning of Summer  
 to get the caravan ready to come to   
 ,in the six weeks summer holiday.The  
 caravan sites open before Easter and  
 then they close at the beginning of   
 October.
