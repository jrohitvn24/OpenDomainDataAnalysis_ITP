		<content>{  The Upper Deck swimming pool was    
{opened in 1936.} It is a heated open  
 air pool and is equipped with "water  
 slides".  Many children from local    
 schools use the pool and it usually   
 opens for the season on the Spring    
 Bank Holiday weekend.  The entrance   
 lies along the tow path on the River  
 Thames near Molesey Lock. {The tow    
{path here is a very popular place for 
{walking}and viewing the events on the 
 river.                                
{  There are several boatyards on the  
{river in this area}where those who can
 afford to can keep large pleasure     
 boats. {Rowing and canoeing are       
{popular river sports}and there are    
 several boat clubs on this stretch of 
 the river. {In 1867 the first         
{Molesey Amateur Regatta was held}and  
 this is now a popular annual event.
