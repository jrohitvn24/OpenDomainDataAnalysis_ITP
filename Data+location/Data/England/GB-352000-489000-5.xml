		<title>05THE GARDEN CENTRE.</title>
		<content>{ Natland Garden Centre}occupies six   
 acres but when it was started in 1936 
 it was contained within a back garden.
 There are now four full-time employees
 and six part-timers (who work when the
 seasons allow), together with the two 
 brothers who own the business. The    
 busiest time of year is during March  
 and June, but in the Winter it is     
 fairly quiet. In the Summer, plants   
 need watering once or even twice a    
 day, most taking between three or four
 months before they reach maturity.    
  Plants are sold as far afield as     
{Penrith, Kirby Lonsdale}and{Kendal    
{markets,}while celebrities such as    
 M.P.s and the cast of 'Coronation     
 Street' often call to the Centre to   
 buy them. The most popular plants are 
{lobelias}and{French marigolds.
