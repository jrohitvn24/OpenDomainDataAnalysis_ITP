		<content>  In terms of forest Britain is one of 
the poorest countries in  Europe with  
only about  9% of these islands under  
woodland. The wood that we are growing 
is of such a low standard that it is   
only being used for paper pulp and     
non-structual woodwork.Unless there is 
a change of direction it seems that by 
2020 hardwood timber will be one of    
the  rarest resources on earth.British 
foresters are proud of there           
achievments over the years but they    
have not been without criticism. Since 
Yardley Chase has been managed by the  
Forestry Commision, much of it has     
been  replanted with the faster        
growing  varieties of trees such as    
the Spruce and the Pine, now however   
that policy is changing aand Oaks are  
once again being planted in The Chase. 
At one time the forest provided the    
village with a thriving industry.      </content>
