		<content> Nearly all the children from this area
 will go to Lipson Comprehensive School
 for their secondary education. This   
 school opened in September 1984, and  
 the local Secondary Modern schools are
 being closed in July 1985, when all   
 their pupils will transfer to the new 
 school. Children can still enter the  
 selection test for Grammar Schools at 
 age 11, but most people who were asked
 locally think the Grammar Schools     
 should close. Most people think that  
 the Efford Secondary Modern School    
 will be knocked down and the land sold
 for housing. Some people say that the 
 building should be saved and used as a
 Community Centre. It was opened in    
 1952.
