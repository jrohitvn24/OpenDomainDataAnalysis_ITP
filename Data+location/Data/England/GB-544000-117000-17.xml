   Where do people do most of their    
 shopping?{60%}use Uckfield (the near- 
 est town);{18%,}Lewes (90% use super- 
 markets). Only{1%}use their local     
 store which in most cases are the{Post
{Offices}(some people are nearer to    
 Uckfield). People who shop in towns   
 other than Uckfield tend to do so     
 because they work there or are passing
 through. Otherwise special trips are  
 made about once a week. Few shop less 
 than once a week, although{93%}have   
 freezers.{88%}use private cars.       
   The P.O.'s provide an important ser-
 vice.{53%}use them mostly because they
 are convenient, e.g. buying items for-
 gotten from the towns. Others collect 
 pensions or buy stamps. The choice of 
 goods and better prices in the towns
