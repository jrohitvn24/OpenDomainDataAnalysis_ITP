		<title>04WINTER AND SUMMER, BELTHORNE</title>
		<content> This is an isolated part of           
 Lancashire, the main centres of       
 population being some miles away. The 
 people who live in this area have to  
 be able to look after themselves and a
 car would seem to be essential.       
 It is very pleasant in the Spring and 
 Summer, especially if you like bleak, 
 open moorland, but it often rains a   
 great deal of the time.               
                                       
 In the Winter the roads are often     
 blocked off with snow or are unsafe   
 because of ice. The sheep are at risk 
 because they might get stuck in the   
 snow and freeze to death.             
                                       
 Farmers will have to look after the   
 cows inside and keep them warm or they
 might die.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
