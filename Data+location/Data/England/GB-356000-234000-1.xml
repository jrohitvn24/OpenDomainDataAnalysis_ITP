		<title>01Fownhope and the River Wye</title>
		<content> The river Why mearders through the    
 western side of the area with flat    
 readows on either side which are      
 liable to frequent flooding - good    
 agriculture land.  The middle and     
 eastern part of the area is very      
 wooded.  Most of this is Hauge Wood,  
 an area, mostly confiers, owned by the
 forestry commission.  This area is    
 very popular for walkes  and          
 ornithologists from Hereford as it has
 numerous public tracks. In the south  
 of the area is the prosperous village 
 of Fownhope.  In recent years the     
 private housing estate have been built
 of about 50 houses/bungalows in each. 
 These are mainly occupied by retired  
 people and those who work in hereford 
 - six miles away.  The remainder of   
 the scattered community in the rest of
 the area are largely corrected with   
 agriculture.                          </content>
