		<title>19IT'S  A  KNOCKOUT!</title>
		<content>   One Saturday in June our school took
 part in an{'It's A Knockout'}competi- 
 tion as part of the Exeter Festival.  
 Five teams from different schools in  
 our area took part. There were five{  
{events}consisting of a wheel-barrow   
 race, a dressing-up game, a three-    
 legged race, a balloon game and a     
 surprise game.                        
   The competition was held at St.     
 Thomas High School playing field and  
 it{rained}during the games so we all  
 got wet.                              
   At the end of the competition we had
 won. We went up to an{Exeter City F.C.
 player who gave us our medals. The    
{Mayor of Exeter}presented us with our 
 cup and we did a lap of honour round  
 the course.                           
   On the following Friday in assembly 
 Mr. Helmsley told the{school}about our
 win.                                  </content>
