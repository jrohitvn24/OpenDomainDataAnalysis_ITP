		<content> There is a constant demand for sand   
 from this quarry.  The people who buy 
 the sand are mainly builders'         
 merchants and people in the business  
 of ready-mix concrete.  The sand costs
 Â£2 per tonne.  The transport used is  
 tippers, 16 and 20 tonnes gross.  The 
 furthest selling point is in          
 Southport.                            
 14 people are employed, including 7   
 drivers, 2 workmen, a secretary and   
 the owner himself.  It is a family    
 business.  The owner's mother, father,
 and brother also help.
