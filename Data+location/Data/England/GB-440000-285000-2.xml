		<title>02New Wolvey</title>
		<content> There have been quite a few changes   
 over the years,  in particular over   
 the last 10 or 12 years in the{       
{POPULATION}of the village.Many new    
 houses have been built in new roads   
 off the south side of Bulkington Road.
 These new developments have been      
 mainly of detached modern-style family
 houses. Wolvey was chosen under the   
 Warwickshire Structure Plan as a Key  
 village which should be developed,    
 hence the housing development and the 
 opening of the new school in          
 1973.During the last 10 years the     
 number of houses has probably doubled.
