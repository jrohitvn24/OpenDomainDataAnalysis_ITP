		<title>19LIFE IN A PUB &amp; A RESTAURANT</title>
		<content> OUR FAMILY HAVE BEEN LIVING AT THE    
 CROWN FOR NEARLY 5 YEARS NOW. I ENJOY 
 LIVING IN THE PUB AND MEETING NEW     
 PEOPLE. IT IS VERY HARD WORK,         
 ESPECIALLY FOR MY MUM AND DAD. I TRY  
 TO HELP THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THE 
 BIGGEST SNAG ABOUT LIVING IN A PUB IS 
 THAT I DON'T SEE MUCH OF MY PARENTS   
 BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS WORKING. THE  
 PUB OPENS FROM 10.30a.m.UNTIL 2.30p.m.
 AND FROM 6p.m.TO 11p.m.               
                                       
 WE HAVE LIVED AT "THE OAKS" FOR ABOUT 
 A YEAR. LIVING IN A RESTAURANT IS     
 DIFFICULT AT TIMES. I SOMETIMES HELP  
 MY PARENTS ON SUNDAYS, SHOWING PEOPLE 
 TO THEIR SEATS AND TAKING ORDERS. MY  
 BROTHER HELPS TO LOAD THE DISHWASHER  
 IN THE KITCHEN. ON MONDAYS WE ARE     
 CLOSED SO WE ALL GO OUT FOR DINNER OR 
 TO THE BEACH. IN SUMMER WE OPEN EVERY 
 DAY AND LIFE IS VERY HECTIC.          </content>
