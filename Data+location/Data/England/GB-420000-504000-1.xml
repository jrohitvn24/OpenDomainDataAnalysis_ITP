		<content> There are a variety of homes in our   
 block from very large houses to small 
 cottages.                             
 Most of the houses are owner occupied 
 although some farm workers still live 
 in cottages and houses which are owned
 by the farmers.                       
 There are four blocks of terraced     
 properties which are two storeys high.
 There are about 18 semi-detached      
 houses and bungalows. Most of the     
 housing is detached, quite a number of
 these have not been standing very     
 long.                                 
 There are four different estates which
 are new developments. Some have been  
 built with brick and others with      
 Yorkshire stone.                      
 There are six large farms and six     
 large manors or halls which are still 
 lived in.
