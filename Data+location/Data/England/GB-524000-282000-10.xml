		<title>10CHURCH FARM (PART 2)</title>
		<content> Mr. Racey owns Church Farm. He keeps  
 cattle for market and also works a    
 number of fields. He keeps chickens   
 for eggs. He has several tractors. The
 tractors cost over Â£17,OOO each. He   
 says they always seem to break down   
 when there's alot of work or when it  
 is raining. Then he has to go out and 
 mend them himself. During the harvest 
 the men work shifts day and night to  
 get the work done. The combine        
 harvester never stops except to be    
 refuelled. He says it's busy all the  
 year round and he has to try to fit   
 his holidays into the farm schedule.  
 This means that he cannot always take 
 his holidays during school holidays.
