		<title>13The Ghost of Tempsford Hall</title>
		<content> As well as a church most older English
 villages have a manor house.Tempsford 
 hall has a very rich history including
 its own ghost.In the summer of  1848  
 when a Mr &amp; Mrs Elliot held the       
 tenancy of the hall,they reported     
 hearing gostly footsteps and found    
 doors bolted for no reason. Several of
 their servants left in fear.          
 In August two visual sightings were   
 recorded.The first was a white figure 
 passing by a window the second a man  
 dressed in deep mourning picking roses
 from the garden.No recorded           
 explanations have been found to       
 explain the supposed occult presences 
 other than perhaps the Elliots wished 
 to be freed from their tenancy        
 committments.
