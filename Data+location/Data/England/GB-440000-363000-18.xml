		<content> The{FIVE PITS TRAIL}has been opened   
 recently in the area.It runs along the
 disused track of the{Great Central    
{Railway}.It is designed to be used by 
 walkers ,cylists and horseriders.     
 Eventually it will be part of a large 
 network of trails, linking most of {  
{North East Derbyshire}.The trail links
 the sites of 5 historic collieries-{  
{Tibshelf, Pilsley, Holmewood,         
{Williamthorpe and Grassmoor}.Along the
 3.5 mile trail, the sites have been   
 carefully returned to forestry and    
 agriculture,providing a rural         
 setting.The gentle hills of the trail 
 ensure pleasant views all around. The 
 countryside around supports abundant  
 wildlife, including,{kestrel, lapwing 
{&amp; heron}.The section of the trail in  
 this area is also suitable, in parts, 
 for wheelchair users.  * Further
