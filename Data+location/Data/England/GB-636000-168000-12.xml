		<title>12    Drapers Mill</title>
		<content>    At one time there were three mills 
 standing but now there is only one.   
 This smock mill was restored sometime 
 between 1968 and 1975. An earlier mill
 may have stood there since about 1695 
 but we are not sure. Little Drapers   
 Mill used to stand not far away       
 towards St.Peters.                    
    All through the 60's and the early 
 70's Drapers Mills C.P.School had a   
 Windmill Fair to raise money for the  
 restoration of the mill that was      
 falling apart at the seams. The Fair  
 was held on St.Johns Field.           
    A plaque on the wall of the        
 windmill says - This plaque is in     
 memory of MR R.M.TOWES headmaster of  
 Drapers Mills School from 1949-1974,  
 without whose inspiration and         
 dedication, this mill would not be    
 standing today.
