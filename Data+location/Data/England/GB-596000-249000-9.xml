It is hoped that work will begin soon  
on the rebuilding of St Mary's Church  
tower, which fell down in 1976. 70,000 
pounds is needed for its restoration.  
The general opinion is that it is a    
costly operation, but must be afforded 
to preserve our heritage. A minority   
felt that the money raised should be   
given to the Third World.              
The gravestones at Bildeston Baptist   
Church have recently been re-sited and 
it was thought by the villagers to be  
a good idea. The area has become more  
attractive and it is easier to keep    
tidy.                                  
Wattisham.                             
Although the people of Wattisham enjoy 
living in the friendly atmosphere a    
small village provides, they feel that 
their life is adversely affected by the
presence of R.A.F.Wattisham.           </content>
