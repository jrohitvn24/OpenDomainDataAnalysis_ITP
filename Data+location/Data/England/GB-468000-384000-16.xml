		<content> We went on a visit to Mr. Kent's      
 Corner Farm to ask him some           
 questions.Mr. Kent first started as a 
 farm worker many years ago.  He has   
 another farm three miles away.  He    
 farms 34O acres.  They have 2OO acres 
 of crops and l4O acres of grass.  He  
 has l3O cows and two bulls.  He has   
 l3O calves each year but he only keeps
 6O calves and sells the rest.  Mr.    
 Kent also has 4 pigs and a few sheep. 
 He grows corn and sugar beet.  In the 
 winter they feed the cows on sugar    
 beet pulp, brewers grains, rolled     
 barley and cow cake.  They have to be 
 milked twice a day.  Mr. Kent gets 2OO
 tons of barley each year and 4OO tons 
 of sugar beet.  He has 2 full-time    
 workers who start work at 6.OO a.m.   
 and finish work at 6.OO p.m.  The     
 busiest time of the year is harvest   
 time.  (Contined on Page l7)          </content>
