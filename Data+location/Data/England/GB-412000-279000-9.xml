		<content> On average 72,000 copies of the       
{Solihull News}and{Solihull Times}are  
 printed each week. A few of the       
 newspapers are sold by newsagents, but
 the rest are given out free. These    
 papers have been in production for an 
 average of two years in their present 
 form. The papers both have five       
 reporters and they are each           
 responsible for a certain area of     
 news.70.9% of the papers is taken up  
 by advertising. This is mainly        
 property advertising as the idea of a 
 free paper came about as a result of  
 adding news to a Property Times       
 distributed by local estate agents.   
 The Solihull News had to change its   
 circulation ideas to compete, hence   
 our two free papers. Both newspapers  
 are concerned with local news and only
 occasionally do they include national 
 stories.                              </content>
