		<title>19HOUSING IN NORTON.</title>
		<content>    Norton is a small village and      
 consequently there are not many       
 housing developments. The style of the
 houses themselves also varies         
 considerably.                         
   The majority of the houses in Norton
 have been built over the last hundred 
 years. They are a mixture of semi-    
 detached and detached. The detached   
 houses are very large with long drives
 and large gardens.                    
   In addition to these houses there   
 are a few houses which are several    
 hundred years old. These are either   
 former farm houses or worker's        
 cottages and have become a natural    
 part of the countryside.              
   At the moment there are no plans for
 a modern housing estate in Norton as  
 all the available land is currently   
 used for arable and dairy farming.
