		<title>01Shepreth Village</title>
		<content> Shepreth is a small village with a    
 population of 670. It is mainly built 
 around a small river and cross roads, 
 with the houses scattered radially    
 from this centre along the roads. The 
 landscape surrounding is arable farm  
 land crossed by many drainage rivers. 
 As the soil is clay on a chalk base   
 and very flat it is liable to         
 flooding                              
 if not attended to regularly. Many of 
 the older people have lived here all  
 their lives. However the children are 
 leaving the village to find work, and 
 a large part of the population now is 
 younger families, who commute to work 
 outside the immediate area. Their     
 attitudes however show a desire to    
 develop activities for the population 
 in the village and to keep a village  
 identity.                             
                                       </content>
