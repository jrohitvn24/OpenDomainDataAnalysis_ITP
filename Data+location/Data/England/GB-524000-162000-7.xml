 In June I went to Carshalton Carnival 
 In fact I was in it, I was a May      
 Queen on the Beddington May Queen     
 float.  We started off at St. Helier  
 hospital and later we stopped because 
 they were going to give the best May  
 Queen card.  Our float was a swan and 
 we were sitting inside it.  We were   
 the best May Queen float so we got the
 card.  Then we went to Queen Mary's   
 Childrens' Hospital and threw sweets  
 to the children.  After that we went  
 to Carshalton Park and we had to wait 
 nearly an hour for the prize giving.  
 We won a great big silver cup.
