		<content> When they finish the M25 it will lead 
much of the traffic off our narrow high
street. We have seen some of the work  
going on when we were out doing our    
environmental study. We saw large      
cranes and bulldozers and deep holes   
in the ground for concrete pillars to  
support flyovers. Many people protested
against the motorway being built but   
the people of Eynsford recognised the  
benefits it would bring and organised  
a march along the High Street.         
Demonstrators carried banners saying   
"Lives before lorries", "Save lives    
build M25". We will be glad when it is 
built and our road is safer. People    
will be able to get to the North of    
London and other places much more      
quickley and our village will be safer 
and more peacefull.
