   We obtained the results of this     
 survey by visiting{140}households     
 within our selected area.Out of these 
{140}households there were{478}people  
 living there.{264}of these people     
 were male and{214}were female.        
                                       
  {Age Groups                          
                                       
   We had{9}age groups ranging from{0-4
 to{65+}in years.The largest group of  
 people were parents aged between{30-44
 years although there were quite a lot 
 of parents in the{25-29}age group.    
   The majority of children were       
 between{5-19}years old.There were few 
 children under the age of{5}years,    
 which shows that there is a small     
 decline in birth rate in this area.
