		<title>07A Day in my life in Bristol</title>
		<content> On Tuesday, I woke up at 8 a.m., and  
 went downstairs for breakfast.  After 
 that I cleaned my teeth and washed,   
 then I got dressed and went to school.
 At 9.30 a.m. it is Junior hymn        
 practice, then it is swimming, after  
 which we do Maths., English and Story.
 At 12 p.m. we have lunch.  We play    
 afterwards.  Then we work and play    
 till hometime.  I go to my friend's   
 house.  We either play on his computer
 or watch T.V. Then we have tea.  At   
 4.45 p.m. I change into my football   
 kit, then I play until football       
 training begins at 6 p.m. It is hard  
 but I enjoy it.  We finish at 7.30    
 p.m. and I go home with my dad.  At   
 8.20 p.m. we arrive home; I have a    
 shower and something to eat and at 9  
 p.m. it is time for bed.              
                                       
                                       </content>
