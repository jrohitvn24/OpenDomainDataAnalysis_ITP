		<content>       My dad works 2 shifts at        
{Rothman's Cigarette Factory. }One week
 he works from 6 am until 2 pm.  The   
 other week he works from 2 pm until 10
 pm.  The factory is very big.  My dad 
 operates a packing machine which means
 he packs the cigarettes into boxes    
 ready to be sold in the shops.  They  
 also export the cigarettes to         
 different parts of the world such as  
 the Middle East, Belgium, Norway and  
 cyprus.  My dad is machine operator   
 but he started off as an intermediate.
                                       
       My dad sometimes packs the      
 cigarettes into{camel packs}which the 
 Arabs take across the deserts strapped
 to camels.  They sometimes smuggle    
 these over the border.  There are     
 about 900 workers in my dad's factory.
