		<title>07THE OYSTER FARMS</title>
		<content>  The oyster farms are managed by Ray  
 Castell.The site is an intermediate   
 stage in the process culture of       
 oysters.In West Stall they  have a    
 hatchery,they breed from them,and     
 collect millions of eggs and sperm    
 bring them  together as small         
 larvae.That is the first stage in     
 breeding oysters.Later in a couple of 
 weeks,the oysters will cease          
 moving and will settle on a firm      
 surface.At that stage it will become a
 tiny oyster about the size of a       
 pinhead.Oysters when, they come here, 
 are about six mm in length.Lakes and  
 resevoirs of food are here and they   
 contain microscopic plants,such as    
 algae which grows more densely than in
 the sea.
