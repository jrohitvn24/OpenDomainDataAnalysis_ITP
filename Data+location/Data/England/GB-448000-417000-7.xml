		<content> Although Wentbridge is now a quiet,   
 sleepy little village, tucked away    
 from the bustle of the A1, it has had 
 an exciting past.                     
     In the seventeenth century, people
 who were trying to escape from the    
 witch-hunters took refuge in nearby   
 Brockadale. The most famous of these  
 was Mary Pannal who was burned at the 
 stake after being convicted at York in
 l603. Another well known character who
 lived in the area was the highwayman, 
 Nevison. He stayed at the Gate Inn in 
 Wentbridge and claimed protection     
 money from travellers for giving them 
 a safe passage between the Bluebell   
 Inn, Wentbridge, and Ferrybridge.     
     Nevison was the one who really    
 made the ride from London to York, not
 Turpin. He escaped from his pursuers  
 at Pontefract by taking a daring leap.
    He was caught and executed at York.</content>
