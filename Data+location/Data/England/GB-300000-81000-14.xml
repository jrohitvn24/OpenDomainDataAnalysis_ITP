		<title>14Life in Brixington.</title>
		<content> I live at{1 Diane Close,Exmouth}I like
 my house and my family.I would like my
 bedroom to be a bit bigger and have a 
 room built just for the animals that  
 had a door going into the garden.My   
 brother and I go to{Brixington Junior 
{School.}My teacher is called Miss     
 Brimblecombe.Our school has its own   
 outdoor swimming pool,but I wish it   
 was indoor and heated because it is   
 freezing cold!We have many clubs in   
 our school and I go to choir.We       
 recently performed the{Wizard Of Oz.}I
 wish that there were more playing     
 areas around Brixington.It would be   
 nice for everyone if we had a big     
 leisure centre that had a swimming    
 pool and a playing field.We could     
 easily do without these things but    
 life would be a lot easier and happier
 if we did have them.The only problem  
 is ,where do we find the money!       </content>
