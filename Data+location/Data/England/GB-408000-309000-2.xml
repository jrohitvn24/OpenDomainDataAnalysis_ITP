		<title>02 Farewell: Hamlet and Church</title>
		<content>     Farewell is a hamlet about 3.2km  
N.W   of Lichfield. It gets its name   
from a good, clear well which springs  
up there.                              
     Farewell church has a long        
history.It was built as part of a      
hermitage and in 1140 was given to some
nuns. In 1527 it was closed by Henry   
V111. Over the years, much of the      
church fell down and local people used 
the stone for homes, barns and walls.  
In the 1740's the church was repaired  
and much of it was rebuilt in red      
brick.It is small and simply decorated.
     It used to have a gallery but this
has been filled in and is now the      
Sunday School room. The church has some
very old furniture, including some     
choir-stalls with misericords.
