		<title>03Kettlethorpe/Fenton Housing</title>
		<content> Several large houses in Fenton are    
 empty and derelict. Semi-detached     
 council houses built in 1930s and old 
 tied cottages are occupied,mainly by  
 farm workers.'Infill' private housing 
 was built in 1970s/80sfor people      
 wanting to live in the country and    
 able by affluence and cheap petrol to 
 commute.A terraced block of small old 
 houses was demolished in 1960s and    
 replaced by council flats/maisonettes 
 for local elderly people. Following   
 government policy to sell council     
 houses half are now owner occupied.   
 Kettlethorpe Hall is still a family   
 home; the estate was sold in 1946.    
 Apart from three pairs of council     
 houses in 1930s there was no building 
 until 1960s/70s, when three dwellings 
 were built in the old Rectory grounds.
 House construction mainly red brick   
 and pantiles. House sales are slow.   </content>
