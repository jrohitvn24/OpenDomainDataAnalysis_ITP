		<title>05STATISTICS OF THE RESERVOIRS</title>
		<content> There are three reservoirs which form 
 one large water catchment.  The       
 heighest one is Wessenden Old, built  
 in 1839 and 299.6m. above sea level.  
 Then when it was necessary to collect 
 more water another dam was built in   
 1903 to form Blakeley Reservoir. This 
 is 258.2m. above sea level.  Finally  
 to complete the system Butterley,     
 234.4m. above sea level, was formed in
 1907 below the other two.             
   Butterley is the largest with a     
 surface area of 15 hectares, a        
 capacity of 1,773 thousand cubic      
 metres(tcm) and a depth of 28.3m.     
 Blakeley is the smallest with 108tcm. 
 a surface area of 3 hectares and a    
 depth of 18.9m.  Wessenden with a     
 depth of 14.9m. is not as deep as     
 Blakeley but is larger at 391tcm. and 
 a surface area of 7 hectares.
