		<title>05PARKS AND SPORTS GROUNDS</title>
		<content>        In our area there are a lot of 
 parks and sports grounds. We counted  
 12 parks and 8 sports grounds.        
      The biggest park is Gosport Park 
 where there is a large childrens play 
 ground and its  own sports ground.    
 People use the park for walking dogs  
 or playing around with a football or a
 cricket set. It is a very peaceful    
 place and on a clear day you have good
 view across the River Alver to Haslar 
 Bridge, the Naval Cemetry and even    
 Portsmouth Cathedral and the          
 Guildhall.                            
      On the whole the recreation      
 facilities are quite adequate and     
 cater for all ages and interests.
