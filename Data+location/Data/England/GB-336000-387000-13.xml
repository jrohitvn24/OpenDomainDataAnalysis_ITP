		<content> This is the name of a very busy street
 in our  area. There are a lot of shops
 in  Lodge Lane  and it is a good place
 to go  shopping. A lot  of  the  shops
 have been  renovated  since the summer
 of 1981 when  many  of the shops  were
 damaged during the Toxteth riots.     
 Lodge Lane  is a very  old  street and
 its  name  comes  from  the  fact that
 originally  Lodge Lane  led  to  Lodge
 Farm which was situated at Otterspool.
 When we were doing our survey of Lodge
 Lane we found out that Lodge Lane also
 has an  open  air street market on the
 site of some demolished homes.        
 The only banks  that  were in our area
 were  situated on  Lodge Lane. We also
 found  out that service shops  such as
 hair-dressers had  not  been  given  a
 separate category on the  count survey
 data so they had to  be  listed  under
 the category of non-food shops.       </content>
