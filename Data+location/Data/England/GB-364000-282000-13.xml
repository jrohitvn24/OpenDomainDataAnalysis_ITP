		<content>  A service is held in the{Church}every
 Sunday. Matins &amp; Evensong with hymns  
 are from the 1662 Prayer Book. The    
 Communion Service is Rite A. Older    
 members enjoy the 1662 Communion when 
 there is a 5th Sunday in the month.   
 Christmas, Easter &amp; Harvest services  
 are well attended. On Sundays about 5%
 of parishioners attend. Everyone joins
 in weddings &amp; funerals.               
  Tourists visit the church to see the 
 beautiful Norman font &amp; Saxon         
 tympanum. The Norman tower is about to
 be repaired at a cost of Â£20,000. The 
 extension of the churchyard had its   
 first burial this year.               
  A monthly service is held in the     
{Methodist}Chapel.{Catholics}go to     
 Cleobury Mortimer or Bridgnorth. There
 is a{Baptist}Chapel in Chorley which  
 several Stottesdon people attend,     
 especially for Sunday School.         </content>
