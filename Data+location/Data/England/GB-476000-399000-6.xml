		<title>06THE HAXEY HOOD GAME</title>
		<content>    Sometime in the 12th century,Lady  
 De Mowbray was on horseback,going     
 home from the church,when a gust of   
 wind blew her black silk hood off of  
 her head.                             
    13 workmen,who were in a field     
 nearby,saw her hood fly off and       
 started to scramble for it.After some 
 time fighting for it,the srongest     
 of the men came out with the hood.But 
 he was too shy to give it back to Lady
 De Mowbray,so he gave it to another   
 man, and that man gave it to the Lady.
    Lady De Mowbray giggled and said   
 the strong man had been a Fool,and the
 man who gave her hood back was a      
 Lord.She said that she wanted the game
 to carry on and to be held each 6th of
 January.She called all the other men  
 Boggins,because they had been bogged  
 into the ground.
