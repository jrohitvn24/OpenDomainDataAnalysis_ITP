		<content>      It was such a late spring that   
 snowdrops were not in flower          
 till March- at the same time as the   
 daffodils. Three gardens in Little    
 Challows and several in the Tynings   
 had lovely displays of bulbs and white
 tulips were especially effective.     
 Blossom time, also late, was          
 marvellous; apples, pears, cherries,  
 lilac and laburnum decked the village.
      Bedding plants came on very late,
 antirhinums and astors barely out     
 before August but the garden at the   
 corner of Hart's Lane and the border  
 outside the shop were very colourful. 
 Troughs of flowers outside houses in  
 Cuttle Lane provided colour most of   
 the summer and there were lovely      
 dahlias and hollyhocks at cottages    
 around the Green. Yellow tagates      
 round the War Memorial were cheerful  
 and the pubs had colourful displays.  </content>
