		<content> Arrangements for adult education,     
 mainly in the form of evening classes,
 exist at the Stratton Community       
 College. The Upper School campus and  
 facilities are used for this amenity. 
 Classes are co-ordinated by an adult  
 education tutor with the help of an   
 administrative assistant, and run on  
 three evenings per week for periods of
 5,10 or 20 weeks for non-vocational   
 subjects or 30 weeks in the case of   
 courses which lead to external exam-  
 inations. Enrolment takes place during
 September and current fees payable to 
 Beds. County Council are based on an  
 hourly rate of 76p for non-vocational 
 courses and 33p for vocational ones.  
 Young persons, over 16 and under 18   
 yrs., out of full-time education, pay 
 a reduced sum.  The centre serves the 
 population of Biggleswade and the     
 surrounding villages.                 </content>
