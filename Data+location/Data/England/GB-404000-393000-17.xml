		<title>17Grouse Shooting</title>
		<content>      The{red grouse}is found on the   
 moors around{Glossop.}It lives on the{
{young heather.} Landowners often burn 
 off the old heather in spring to      
 encourage new growth.                 
      The grouse shooting season starts
 on the{12th August,}and lasts until   
 autumn. On the days shooting takes    
 place the moors are closed to walkers.
 Signs are posted at all access points.
      The beaters walk towards the     
 shooting butts which hide those       
 shooting. The beaters make a lot of   
 noise so that the grouse fly up into  
 the air and are shot with a double    
 barrelled shotgun. Dogs then bring    
 back the dead grouse.                 
      The grouse may be eaten. They are
 hung up in a cupboard or shed for 8   
 weeks prior to eating. Some groups    
 oppose this sport and disrupt the     
 shooting.                             </content>
