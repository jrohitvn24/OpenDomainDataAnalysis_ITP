woke up at 9:00am and my mum brought   
me a cup of tea.At 9:15am I got up and 
got dressed,then went and had a        
breakfast of cornflakes.Then I went to 
play on my computer with 3 friends at  
home. We played for nearly 3 hours     
'til 12:45pm. Then I went to change my 
library book.At 1:10pm I arrived home  
to have dinner.We had a barbeque with  
beefburgers and sausages.              
  After dinner I went to Jarrolds with 
my parents.We bought a Patio set and   
two reclining Sunbeds.We got back at   
3:30pm and I watched cricket on TV     
until around 6:00pm then I went to buy 
our tea at Moneys Fish and Chip shop.  
At 6:45pm I settled down to read a     
book called "The Mystery of the Magic  
Circle" and watched TV.I went to bed   
at 10:15pm .                           </content>
