		<content>  Noke and Islip both have big playing 
fields and there are good country walks
especially on Otmoor.The three tennis  
courts in Islip are privately          
owned.Jogging is a popular keep fit    
pastime.Islip supports two football    
clubs,a cricket club,a youth club,an   
old age pensioners club,a British      
Legion Branch, and an amateur dramatic 
group called the Islip Players.The     
clubs are well supported and there is  
a full programme of cricket and        
football matches every year.The Islip  
Players attract amateur actors from    
the whole area,and from outside it as  
well,and their performances are always 
fully booked.There is a children's     
playground in Islip with swings and    
climbing frames,and children also use  
the school playground.For other        
games people have to go to the sports  
centre in Kidlington or elsewhere.     </content>
