		<title>15St. Mary's Church.</title>
		<content> The original Church in Olveston was   
 built during the transitional Norman  
 period (c.117O). There is evidence of 
 an ecclesiastical establishment as    
 early as the reign of Edwin(617-633)  
 and therefore a possibility of an     
 earlier Church.                       
 Today Mrs.Caroline Roe is the         
 Deaconess of St. Mary's Church,       
 Olveston. She also takes services at  
 nearby villages of Almondsbury,       
 Alveston, Aust, Elberton and          
 Littleton. Not only does she take     
 services but also morning prayer,     
 evening prayer, baptisms and funerals.
 She is not allowed to take weddings   
 and Holy Communions. There is a close 
 relationship between the village      
 school and the Church. Mrs.Roe has    
 been a Deaconess for a year and 3     
 weeks. She finds Olveston village very
 friendly.                             </content>
