		<content> The rapid rise in car ownership has   
 affected rural areas greatly: extra   
 mobility eases shopping and{local     
{shops close}(no food shops in         
 Thornwood or Epping Upland) and fewer 
 footpaths are walked regularly.Most of
 the{footpaths have been ploughed}and  
 the legal requirement to make them    
 good ignored.Although legal rights of 
 way,most are virtually abandoned,so   
 farmers cannot be  blamed for this.The
 survey group tried to follow one path 
 through a rape field.A neighbour,asked
 advice,suggested a detour "And if he  
 complains,say you were going to walk  
 through his rape crop-he'll get the   
 point."                               
 A few farms have been combined,making 
 some of the houses redundant.These are
 open for new owners from larger towns.
 The decline in farm employment has    
 also released former tied cottages.   </content>
