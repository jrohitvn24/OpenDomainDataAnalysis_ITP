		<content> The farms of the area are mostly      
 family, mixed farms of between 75 and 
 200 acres and one undertaking that    
 does contract work for other farmers. 
 There are also some smallholdings of  
 only a few acres which do not provide 
 sufficient income to maintain a       
 family, but are supplemental to some  
 other work. There is a nursery with   
 glasshouses which provides plants and 
 vegetables to local customers. There  
 is much concern in the area for the   
 future of farming and therefore for   
 the countryside as a whole. The       
 economy is based on the family farm,  
 but because of instability tourism is 
 fast becoming a close second and a    
 complementary boost as the extra rooms
 in the farmhouse can be used for bed  
 and breakfast in the summer season.
