		<content> TOURISM. Ashdown Forest is the largest
 open space between London and the     
 South Coast and two million people    
 visit the area annually. Recently the 
 Conservators of the Forest with aid   
 from the Manpower Services Commission 
 have constructed new car parks with a 
 view to controlling and spreading the 
 visitors. People come to the S.W. cor-
 ner of the Forest to picnic, to walk  
 or to buy or pick fruit from the farms
 which are a feature of the area.      
 TRADE. For a small village it is      
 reasonably well supplied with shops.  
 There is a good general store selling 
 fresh and forzen food; groceries,     
 alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks; a 
 Post Office selling stationery &amp; toys;
 a bicycle shop also elling hardware   
 and garden supplies; a bakery making  
 meat pies and pastry; a printer and   
 two garages selling oil and petrol.   </content>
