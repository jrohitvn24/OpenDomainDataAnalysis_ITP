		<title>12A WALKER'S PARADISE</title>
		<content> In an area that is entirely rural we  
 have a wide choice of terrain: field, 
 forest and moorland; ideal territory  
 for walkers.  An old pack horse route 
 goes from a point South of Toft Hill  
 Farm up onto Cold Moor. The stone     
 guide post markers which stand at     
 intervals along the track remain in   
 position. Several long distance       
 footpaths pass through the area,      
 namely The Lyke Wake Walk(supposed to 
 follow an ancient burial route), The  
 Bilsdale Circuit, The White Rose Walk,
 The Cleveland Way and The Coast to    
 Coast. A memorial to a walker who     
 loved the moors stands on Cringle     
 Moor in the form of a stone seat. The 
 Manpower Services Commission has      
 recently completed a set of way       
 markers in the form of stiles and     
 footbridges to help walkers on their  
 way.                                  </content>
