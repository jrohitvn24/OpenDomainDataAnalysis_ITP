		<title>09FLOATING NIGHTCLUB,GATESHEAD</title>
		<content>   The "Tuxedo Princess" is a{floating 
{nightclub and discotheque.}It is      
 moored at Gateshead quayside beneath  
 the world famous landmark of the{Tyne 
{Bridge.}The ship was originally a     
 Glasgow built car ferry which took    
 holiday-makers to Ireland and later to
 the Channel Isles. The "Princess" can 
 accomodate 1400 people and has proved 
 to be so popular that parties come to 
 it from{Scotland}and{Yorkshire.}      
 Because it is 'out of the ordinary'   
 families go there for their           
 celebrations.We were surprised to see 
 that the staff are dressed like a     
 ship's crew and we were assured that  
 the vessel is seaworthy. The fame of  
 the "Princess" is spreading. A similar
 nightclub may be opened on the{Thames 
 and the{Chinese government}have asked 
 the owners for advice on a similar    
 venture.                              </content>
