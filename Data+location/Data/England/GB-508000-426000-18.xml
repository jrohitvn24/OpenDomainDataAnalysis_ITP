		<title>18HULLS ART GALLERIES</title>
		<content> The main art gallery in Hull is the   
 Ferens gallery, built by industrialist
 Thomas Ferens.  It is built in the    
 Corinthian style with its rooms around
 a central court with a balcony.  The  
 permanent collection has 300 oil      
 paintings and about the same number of
 etchings often with a maritime theme. 
 The gallery is a very popular place   
 not only because of its works of art  
 but also because it offers peace      
 and quiet. Every year it has some     
 163,000 visitors. The other gallery   
 has only recently come under the City 
 councils banner and that is the       
 Posterngate gallery in the centre of  
 the Old Town. It was taken over from  
 the Lincolnshire and Humberside Arts  
 Council in April 1984 and hosts       
 Traveling Exhibitions.  20,005 people 
 visited it between April and December 
 1984.                                 </content>
