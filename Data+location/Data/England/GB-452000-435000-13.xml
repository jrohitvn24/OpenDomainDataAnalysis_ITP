		<title>13People - Farms</title>
		<content>  The people living and working on the 
 farms like the idea of living in the  
 family house and farming land farmed  
 by their ancestors, but all agree     
 things have changed. It is more       
 difficult to make a living as life    
 styles have changed. There is not the 
 demand for meat, overheads are higher,
 and the return on their capital has   
 gone down. All agreed that the only   
 way to get on was to work hard and    
 live within your means.               
  The use of a car and the ability to  
 drive is most important as public     
 transport is poor and the railway     
 station some distance away at the     
 other end of Church Fenton. The young 
 people would like more public         
 transport and entertainment but enjoy 
 the privacy of country living.        
  The most general complaint was of    
 aeroplane noise especially at night.  </content>
