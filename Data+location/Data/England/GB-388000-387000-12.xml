		<title>12WAR MEMORIAL</title>
		<content> The War Memorial had its inception in 
 1919. The present building was raised 
 by subscription and in 1925 the       
 present building was erected. Because 
 so much money was raised an{Art       
{Gallery}was added on to the building. 
 The entrance to the Memorial Hall is  
 supported by two Cippolino (Greek)    
 marble columns. The walls are faced   
 with a soft brownish-yellow Botticino 
 Mazzano (Italian) Marble. The names   
 of the fallen are engraved in White   
 Italian Marble. Over the door on the  
 left, as one enters, there is the     
 inscription "There Name Liveth For    
 Evermore". On the facing wall there is
 an extract from the Kings Scroll which
 was sent to the relatives of every    
 fallen man during the Great War. In   
 1952 three more tablets were added to 
 bear the names of those who died in   
 World War II.                         </content>
