		<content> The most popular leisure activity in  
 Tonbridge is watching television.     
 However, Tonbridge has many sports    
 facilities.The main sports centres are
 the Sports Ground and The Angel Centre
 which is an indoor complex.The Angel  
 Centre caters for Gymnastics,         
 badminton, squash, basketball, dancing
 and rollerskating etc. There are      
 things to suit all ages and tastes. It
 also has exhibitions, craft fairs, and
 occasionally films.The Sports Ground  
 has facilities for tennis,football,   
 rugby,cricket,bowls and an 18 hole    
 putting green.Although we already have
 an outdoor swimming they are thinking 
 of building an indoor one,but nothing 
 has happened yet.                     
 There are no cinemas in Tonbridge now 
 but there used to be two.One is now a 
 Bingo Hall the other a store.
