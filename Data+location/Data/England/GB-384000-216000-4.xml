		<title>04Day in Life of Mrs.J Hawkins</title>
		<content> The alarm clock goes off at 7.30 and  
 this is the start of a typical Monday.
 I call the children,if they are not   
 already awake,and go to the bathroom. 
 After dressing,I go downstairs and get
 the packed lunches ready.We have      
 breakfast between 8.00 and 8.30.It is 
 normally fruit juice,cereal and toast.
 About 8.45 I send the children up to  
 the bathroom to clean their teeth and 
 then I brush their hair before we     
 leave for school at about 9.00.I walk 
 along with them,taking our dog,Toby,  
 with us.I return home about 9.20 leave
 the dog,and make my way to work       
 (Mondays and Thursdays only)either by 
 walking,taking the bus,or on the back 
 of my husband's motor-bike.I start    
 work about 9.45.My job is cleaning    
 offices which belong to a joinery     
 works.I work until 1.00 stopping only 
 for coffee and a dripping cake.       </content>
