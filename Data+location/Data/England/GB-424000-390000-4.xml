		<content> One of the most important buildings of
 the area is the Waterworks built      
 in 1917.It was modernised in 1955 &amp;   
 will be completely remodernised in    
 1990.The Waterworks Authority is in   
 charge of three dams(which provide    
 water for both domestic &amp; industrial  
 use)plus one compensatory dam.

 taken for granted;people object to
