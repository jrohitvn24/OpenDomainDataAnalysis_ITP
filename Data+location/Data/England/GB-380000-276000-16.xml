		<title>16Shopping in Kidderminster 1</title>
		<content>{Kidderminster Town Centre}seems quite 
 large to us, but compared with        
 Birmingham and Worcester shopping     
 centres it is in fact small. Although 
 Kidderminster has a variety of shops  
 it is lacking in a variety of stock so
 the range of goods offered is limited.
 For food, there are several large     
{supermarkets}including{Sainsbury's}and
{Waitrose.}In the last few years some  
 smaller food stores have closed down  
 because of the competition from the   
 supermarkets. Kidderminster has two   
{department stores, Owen Owen}and the  
{Co-op,}and has branches of several    
 large{chains}including{Woolworth's,   
{Littlewood's, W.H.Smith's, Marks and  
{Spencer}and{Boots the Chemist.}There  
 are also many smaller shops. Currently
 there are improvements being made in  
 the Town Centre to make it safer; the 
 High Street is now a{pedestrian area. </content>
