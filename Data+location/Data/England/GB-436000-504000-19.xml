		<content> The alarm sounds at 7.20am to awaken  
 the Partington Family, who live in    
 Walcote house,Appleton Wiske,to a     
 typical Wednesday.Breakfast,not       
 necessarily taken together,consists of
 a bowl of cereal each,sometimes toast 
 and orange juice.Ruth,aged 11, leaves 
 the house first to catch the school   
 bus to Allertonshire Comprehensive    
 School some 7 miles away.Derek,the    
 father,leaves next to drive 19 miles  
 to his work as a Reaserch Manager at  
 British steel's Teeside Laboratories  
 in Middlesbrough.Faye,aged 8 is the   
 last to leave,walking about 600 metres
 to the Village Primary School.The     
 mother,Tricia,may stay at home all day
 alternating between machine knitting, 
 to produce sweaters in Shetland Wool  
 for sale through her small business or
 she may spend some time shopping in   
 Yarm or Middlesbrough. Faye Partington</content>
