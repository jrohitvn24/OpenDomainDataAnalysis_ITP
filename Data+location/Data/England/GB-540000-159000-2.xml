		<content> R.A.F STATION BIGGIN HILL             
                                       
       The Armed Forces are represented
 by the Royal Air Force Station where  
 the are 247 employees wearing uniform 
 and 80 civillian employees.  They rate
 from airmen to officers, from clerks  
 to cleaners and from cooks to         
 accountants.                          
       R.A.F. Biggin Hill was opened in
 1916 as a communications centre.  In  
 1952 it was split into two sections - 
 the R.A.F. side and the civillian     
 side run by the Bromley Council.  The 
 station was taken over by the Bromley 
 Council because the runway couldn't be
 extended for the new jet fighters.    
 Now the main function of the station  
 is as an Officers and Aircrew         
 Selection Centre.  At the R.A.F.      
 station there are married quarters for
 320 wives and children.               </content>
