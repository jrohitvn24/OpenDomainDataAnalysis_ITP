 we have to wait for the teacher to    
 blow the whistle at 9.ooam. Then the  
 teacher sends us in class by class.We 
 hang our coats and bags on our pegs.  
 The first thing is hymn practice.     
 About 9.45am we read or write poems   
 until playtime at 10.30am.When we come
 in the time is 10.45am. We do maths   
 with each other.The bell goes at      
 12.00 clock and we go and get washed  
 for lunch. We sit next to each other
