		<title>01Welcome to Chelmsford.</title>
		<content>  {Chelmsford,}the county town of {    
{Essex,}stands at the confluence of the
 rivers,{Chelmer}and{Can,}and obviously
 derives its name from the former.There
 is evidence of a settlement dating    
 from the Roman occupation and it is   
 named in the Domesday Book as{        
{Celmeresfort}and{Celmeresforde,}but   
 there was no major development until  
 the 16th century.                     
   The area covered by this survey     
 lying to the north of the River Can   
 faithfully mirrors the change from the
 quiet market town of the 19th century,
 through the introduction of light     
 industry in the early days of the 20th
 century to the thriving commercial and
 dormitory town of the present age.    
 This change has been inexorable and   
 even now bulldozers are scything a    
 giant swathe through the area to      
 create a major new road.              </content>
