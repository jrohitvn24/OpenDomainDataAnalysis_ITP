		<content>      In 1985 the hall is still managed
 by a voluntary committee composed of  
 representatives of all the            
 organisations using the hall. These   
 range from the youngest,the{Pre-school
{Play Group,}to the older folk of the  
{Friendship Club.}The playing field is 
 used by the{Tennis, Cricket}and       
{Football Clubs. Parish Meetings,      
{Horticultural Shows, Discos, Fashion  
{Shows}and{Private Parties}are among   
 other events held in the hall.        
      This year the kitchen will be    
 refitted to give more space and       
 facilities. The money for this project
 is being raised by grants, loans and  
 various fund raising events. Â£1,000   
 still needs to be raised and local    
 groups are working hard to bridge the 
 gap.
