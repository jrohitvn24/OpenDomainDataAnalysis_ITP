		<title>09A SMALL COUNTRY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Furneux Pelham is a small country    
 village surrounded by farmland. There 
 are no shops or factories where       
 computers are used except for the     
 Brewery and two farms.                
  There are 73 children in the school  
 and half of them have a computer at   
 home which they use for games. 1/5 of 
 these families also use their home    
 computer for business.                
  There is a computer at school which  
 all the children use at some time     
 although it is mainly the older       
 children.
