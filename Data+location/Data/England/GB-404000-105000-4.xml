		<content>     HEATHLAND MANAGEMENT              
     Apart from the deer cull the site 
 is managed in other ways.Parties of   
 school children have helped cut the   
 gorse and keep it under control.Ponds 
 have been created to help fight fires 
 on the heath,these have now been used 
 by many insects &amp; plants.The bridle   
 ways across the heath are now being   
 marked by volunteers to help protect  
 the heath from trampling.             
     The Forestry Commission also      
 manages some woodland in the reserve  
 area and next to it.They &amp; the NCC are
 working together to improve the       
 habitats on all sites.                
     FIRE-is the biggest danger to the 
 heath,although sometimes used to burn 
 out old heather,but otherwise a       
 threat.The largest fire was in 1980   
 but,between 80/85,6 others .It takes  
 5yrs for heath to regrow,fauna longer.</content>
