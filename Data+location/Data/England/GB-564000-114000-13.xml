		<title>13RURAL EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> The farming community employ some     
 local people on a full time and       
 seasonal basis. Inevitably there are  
 agricultural engineers., 2 small firms
 and a dairy equipment maintenance firm
 again with a small workforce. Another 
 local employer is a timber yard. In   
 Bodle Street we have two fruit and    
 vegetable growers who sell to the     
 retail and wholesale trade in         
 Eastbourne but also do a limited      
 amount of pick-your-own.There are two 
 selfemployed car maintanance engineers
 working from home as does a local     
 caterer employing local ladies when   
 necessary. Some villagers commute to  
 local towns like Hailsham, Bexhill,   
 and Eastbourne, a smaller number      
 commuting to London using mainly rail 
 transport. About one third of the     
 villagers are retired.
