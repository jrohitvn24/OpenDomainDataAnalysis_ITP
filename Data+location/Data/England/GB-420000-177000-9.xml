 1 renovated coach house; Eyres Barn,  
 which is converted into a house; The  
 Old Manor House (divided into 2

 detached houses, built during the     
 1960's to recreate a feudal village   
 round a green. There are also 3       
 smaller modern houses.                
 LOWER UPHAM _ consists of 1 old       
 farmhouse and two pairs of fairly     
 modern semi_detached houses.          
 LIDDINGTON WARREN _ One 17th century  
 farm house across the road from 3     
 detached modern farmworkers' houses.  
 Surprisingly there are no old cottages
 in this area.                         
 At present there are no plans for     
 further housing development in this   
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
