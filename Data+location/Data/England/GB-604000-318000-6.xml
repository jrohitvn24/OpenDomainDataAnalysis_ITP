		<content> The Shaver Poultry Breeding Farms (GB)
 Ltd. is situated on Elsing Lane, which
 leads off to the south from the A1067.
 This complex of single story buildings
 is the European headquarters of the   
 Shaver Organisation, whose head office
 is in Canada. Shavers produce grand-  
 parent and parent breeding stock of   
 brown egg layers, white egg layers and
 broilers, for breeding, both in Great 
 Britain and for export. Shaver GB     
 exports to approx. 30 countries. The  
 premises consist of an office block   
 with hatchery which could have an     
 estimated output of 50,000 breeder    
 chicks per week. The main breeding    
 farm, with 11 chicken houses and a    
 capacity of approx. 40,000 birds,     
 adjoins this. The site covers about 7 
 acres and Shaver GB employs around 60 
 people, full and part-time included,  
 drawn from a 13 mile radius.          </content>
