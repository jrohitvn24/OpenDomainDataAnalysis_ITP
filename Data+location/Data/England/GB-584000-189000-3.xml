		<title>03Farming in the Rochford Area</title>
		<content> The largest farm in the area is       
 Keddie's Farm.  It is mainly a dairy  
 farm, although they grow a few arable 
 crops to feed the cattle.  They have  
 170 cows altogether and are milking   
 approximately 120 cows. Another       
 interesting farm is Blatches Farm     
 which is situated alongside a heavily 
 populated area.  At Blatches Farm they
 concentrate on growing crops that they
 can sell to the public on a "Pick Your
 Own" basis.  They grow gooseberries,  
 raspberries, strawberries, rhubarb,   
 runner beans etc. The other farms are 
 Honeypots Farm, Hawkwell Hall Farm and
 Cherry Orchard and Doggetts Farm.     
 Cherry Orchard is mainly an arable    
 farm where they grow wheat, although  
 they are experimenting at the moment  
 with one field of evening primrose    
 which is used pharmaceutically.
