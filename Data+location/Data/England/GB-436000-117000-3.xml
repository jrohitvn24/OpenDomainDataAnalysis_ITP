 of {crops .}Their crops are mostly {  
{winter wheat }and {winter barley }but 
 they do have a bit of {oil seed rape}.
 The main crop in our area is {oil seed
{rape }which is grown at a lot of far- 
 ms . At {Rownhams Farm}they sell their
 goods like {potatoes, cabbages, eggs, 
{straw }and other things . To cut the  
 crops like {winter wheat }and {winter 
{barley }our farms use {combine harves-
{ter }for the big fields and {combine  
{ harvester}that fit onto {tractors }  
 for many jobs on the farm. The farmer 
 hooks other machines on the tractor.  
  Theese machines are called implements
 . There is dairy machinery as well on 
 some farms.For the whole dairy to be  
 made it costs Â£40,000.
