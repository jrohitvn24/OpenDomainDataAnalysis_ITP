		<content> When St.Mary the Virgin Church was    
 originally built is unknown but there 
 was certainly a church in the village 
 in the 10th century.The present church
 was built about 1470 but there were   
 considerable alterations and          
 rebuilding in 1860.The superb red     
 sandstone tower is the oldest part of 
 the Church and rises to 107 feet.There
 is a fine peal of bells,5 of which    
 were cast in 1776.Of outstanding      
 beauty is the still complete 16th     
 century rood screen,the Jacobean      
 pulpit and the carved bench ends.In   
 the south porch a former vicar is     
 buried and a tablet records"My        
 parishioners have tried unsuccessfully
 to walk over me while I am alive;they 
 shall not be denied this pleasure when
 I am dead".There is the 14th century  
 Churchyard cross and also the remains 
 of the Village cross.                 </content>
