		<content> We collected our information on       
Wednesday 15th May 1985.We first saw   
the Coventry to Fazeley canal. The     
first boat we saw was called the       
'Warwick Navigator'. We walked on down 
 the muddy towpath. The longboat       
followed us. It was blue and had a life
savers ring. We passed the Tamworth    
Cruising Club Marina.Many boats were   
out of the water under repair. Some of 
us then went to the railway.There were 
two goods trains carrying coal and one 
passenger train in half an hour. The   
railway travels from Birmingham to     
Derby and the north. We sat beside the 
River Tame. There were no boats because
the river was too shallow. The river is
only slightly polluted now.  On the way
back we saw a water vole in the canal  
and we picked some wild flowers.
