		<content>WHEN QUESTIONED,THE MAJORITY OF PRIMARY
SCHOOL CHILDREN,ESPECIALLY THE INFANTS 
(5-7 YEARS) REPLIED THAT THEY LIKED    
SCHOOL AND THOUGHT THAT THEY OUGHT TO  
ATTEND,OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT LEARN  
ANYTHING.                              
MOST CHILDREN THOUGHT THAT A SCHOOL    
UNIFORM WAS NEEDED BECAUSE IT WAS NEAT 
AND TIDY AND THE WHOLE SCHOOL SHOULD   
LOOK SMART.                            
ABOUT HALF THOSE CHILDREN WHO STAYED   
FOR SCHOOL DINNERS ENJOYED THEM,THE    
OTHERS THOUGHT THAT SANDWICHES WERE A  
GOOD IDEA.                             
ALMOST EVERYBODY AGREED THAT HOMEWORK  
FOR PRIMARY CHILDREN WAS NOT NEEDED AS 
THEY WORKED HARD ENOUGH AT SCHOOL.
