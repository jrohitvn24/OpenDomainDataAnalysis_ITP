		<title>16Playground Games</title>
		<content> Our playground games fall roughly into
 three sorts,chasing,skipping and      
 hiding.We also have lots of rhymes for
 choosing the leader or"dipping for    
 it".In many chasing games,the person  
 caught becomes"it" but some are tag   
 games where a person caught can be    
 "saved" by someone else.British       
 Bulldog,Fast Tag and Lurgie are       
 popular though we have twenty other   
 chasing games.Skipping games can be   
 divided into games where one person   
 stays"in" for as long as they can and 
 the "keep the kettle boiling" type    
 where children follow one another     
 rapidly with the actions becoming     
 harder each time round.These games    
 usually have a rhyme or song to give  
 the rhythm.There are many hide and    
 seek games,usually with a safe haven. 
 52 Bunker and Tree Hunt are popular.
