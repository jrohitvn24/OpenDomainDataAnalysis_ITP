		<title>03 St Minver Parish Church</title>
		<content> The parish church of St.Minver, with  
 its{spire, }which is quite a          
 rarity in Cornwall, was built         
 in the 12 to 1300s. Much of the       
 building was pulled down and rebuilt  
 in the late 1800s.There remain several
 Norman octagonal pillars at the north 
 side,and a font at the rear,of the    
 same period.The three oldest of the   
 six bells were cast in 1777.{Sunday   
{services}are the busiest especially at
 eleven am. The vast majority of the   
 St.Minver parish population lives to  
 the West of the block where there are 
 two daughter churches, but many of    
 them attend this church.The church    
 hall, at the village crossroads, is   
 called the{Perceval Institute.}A      
 Sunday School is held every Sunday in 
 the Vicarage which is about 100m to   
 the east of the church.
