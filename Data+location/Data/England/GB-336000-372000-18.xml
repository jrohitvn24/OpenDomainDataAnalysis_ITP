		<content> There is a wide variety of housing in 
 the area.Farming is the main industry 
 and there are 16 farmhouses,many very 
 old but with modern buildings attached
 In 1954 twenty-two Council houses were
 built in Penfold Close and they are a 
 mixture of semi- detached &amp; terraced. 
 All but 6 are now privately owned.Some
 20 years ago British Nuclear Fuels    
 built 13 semi-detached and terraced   
 houses for their workers on Manor Farm
 Crecent &amp; most of these are now owned 
 privately also.There are 21 private   
 detached houses &amp; 13 detached         
 bungalows in the area all built to    
 individual designs with large areas of
 land attached.The houses were built   
 between 1887 &amp; 1970 but the bungalows 
 are modern &amp; no older than 40 years.To
 the east the farm land borders urban  
 housing estates,mainly privately owned
 New estates are still being added.    </content>
