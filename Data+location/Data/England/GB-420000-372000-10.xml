		<title>10Sallet Hole Mine.</title>
		<content> This modern mine was made following an
 eighteenth century drainage channel   
 and now digs 350 feet deep under      
 Longstone Edge, extracting fluorspar  
 and associated minerals for processing
 at Cavendish Mill nearby. It employs a
 number of miners, most of whom come by
 car from outside the area. A new      
 branch of the mine, with an entrance  
 on the top of Longstone Edge, is now  
 being developed. Drainage is a        
 problem, especially in view of the    
 toxicity of the slurry, and a drain   
 and sump has been made along Coombs   
 Dale and the neighbouring grass fenced
 off to avoid illness for cattle.      
 Special arrangements for piping water 
 are necessary for their needs.
