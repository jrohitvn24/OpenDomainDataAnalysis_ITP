		<content> The area of the Moresby-Keekle        
 open cast site now being worked is an 
 old mine which was worked by the monks
 of High Wreay many years ago.The      
 National Coal Board are in overall    
 charge of the site though the work    
 is contracted out. The site employs   
 120 manual workers and 20             
 administrative staff. When recuiting  
 workers preferential treament is given
 to those who have at one time been    
 employed in a conventional mine.All   
 personnel must wear helmets and       
 fluorescent safety jackets whenever   
 they enter the site.This also applies 
 to poeple riding round the site in    
 land rovers or lorries.An open cast   
 site is less expesive to run than an  
 underground mine.It is much quicker to
 get the coal from the open cast where 
 the seams of coal are more accessible.
