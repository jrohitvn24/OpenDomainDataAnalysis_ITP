		<content> The transport system of Garstang is   
good for a town of this size.Very      
close by the A6 trunk road is used by  
both large and small vehicles          
alike.The road links the towns of      
Lancaster and Preston with the city of 
Manchester. Even more important is the 
M6 motorway which is one of the major  
 routes used nationwide.The motorway   
gives easy access to Scotland,The      
Midlands,London and the South,both for 
haulage firms, private motorists and   
business men.Within Garstang itself    
there are five different bus services  
and a taxi firm.Further afield in      
Preston there is a main line railway   
station which can connect with any town
or city in this country.The Lancaster  
Canal offers an unusual mode of travel.
Ferry services to the Isle of Man and  
Ireland are offered at  Heysham and    
Liverpool respectively.                </content>
