 was formed by the amalgamation of     
 Chard and Yeovil Boroughs,the Urban

 and the Rural Districts of Chard,     
 Yeovil,Langport and Wincanton,it      
 became an Area office of {Y.D.C.}

 of the{Y.D.C.}that Yeovil was totally 
 dominating the former communities,the 
 name was changed in {1985}to{South    
{Somerset District Council.
