		<content> Well served as we are in comparison   
 with many parts of rural Lincolnshire 
 the use of public transport is by no  
 means easy.Heckington is very         
 fortunate in still having a railway   
 station linking it to the main line   
 station at Grantham.                  
 Bus services are very limited running 
 only at peak hours making a short     
 distance shopping journey into a full 
 day's excursion.Daily services run    
 into Sleaford but there is only a     
 twice weekly service to Boston on     
 market days(Wednesday and Saturday).  
 A car has become a necessity, however 
 obtaining petrol requires forethought,
 the village pumps having been closed  
 three years ago.The nearest petrol    
 stations are at East Heckington on the
 way to Boston or in the town of       
 Sleaford.
