 villager's use.                       
 Breamore was not spared the religious 
 upheavals of the 16th c. The{Priory   
 was dissolved in the summer of 1536.  
 In 1577,the{Doddingtons}bought the    
 Priory,and shortly thereafter built   
 Breamore House.                       
 Ownership of the estate passed to the 
{Hulse}family in 1748,and they helped  
 to develop enclosures and increase    
 food production. The number of        
 villagers grew,with many of them now  
 forced to find wage employment on     
 the estate or in nearby Fordingbridge.
 Poverty was a problem and by 1851,    
 nearly 10% of the population were     
 living in parish houses.A Church      
 school was set up in 1830 in a cottage
 on the marsh,and the present village  
 school was built in 1872.             </content>
