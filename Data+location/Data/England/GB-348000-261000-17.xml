		<title>17THE HISTORY OF MORETON SCH.</title>
		<content> In our square there is a school in    
 Moreton which was used up until July  
 1968.In that year it was closed,along 
 with Yarpole and Croft V.A. school and
 the children were transferred to the  
 new school in Luston.Before{ Moreton  
{School}was built there was a school   
 called the{Lady Rodney{School.}This   
 was knocked down and Moreton School   
 was built and opened in 1905 and was  
 owned by{Lord Cawley}of Berrington    
 Hall.The average number of pupils was 
 between 60 and 70.When the school     
 closed in 1968 the old stove was taken
 to{Eye Church}in the next village and 
 the school was sold to the present    
 owners who are Mr and Mrs Williams.It 
 cost Â£2,000 to buy and another Â£2,500 
 to renovate.There has been a lot of   
 internal alteration but the only      
 external alteration has been the      
 fitting of smaller windows.           </content>
