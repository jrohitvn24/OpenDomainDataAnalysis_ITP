		<content> Entertainment for young people in our 
 area includes Cinema, Arcades,        
 Nightclubs, Discos and in the         
 countryside there are Young Farmers   
 Clubs.  We are quite lucky to have a  
 cinema still since most smaller towns 
 do not have one any more.  Most films 
 it shows have been on in Exeter for   
 some time before they get here.  The  
 Arcades are quite new.  Some people   
 said they should not be allowed as    
 they encourage young people to waste  
 time and money.  Disco's are held at  
 schools and the Youth Centre as       
 well as at halls in town.             
 Older people have other entertainments
 especially pubs, bingo, amateur       
 dramatics as well as clubs like the   
 Mid Devon Natural History Society.  We
 don't know so much about these!
