		<content> Eighty Four per cent of those who     
 leave the area to work travel by car &amp;
 only 6% by bus. However many of the   
 old &amp; young still depend on public    
 transport. A bus runs from Stevenage  
 to Walkern 3 times a day (not Sundays)
 &amp; both London &amp; Country and Smiths, a 
 private company, provide a limited    
 service to Stevenage, Hitchin &amp;       
 Hertford 3 days a week. There is      
 concern that if the service is        
 curtailed further some sections of the
 community would suffer real hardship. 
 As few houses in Walkern have garages 
 there is concern about parking in the 
 High Street &amp; about weight &amp; speed of 
 traffic in a village environment.There
 is a growing demand for a pedestrian  
 crossing &amp; carpark. The lack of public
 transport in one way fosters communtiy
 spirit. Improved British Rail services
 to London has facilitated commuting.  </content>
