		<title>12GEOLOGY ON ALSTON MOOR</title>
		<content> The landscape of Alston Moor consists 
 of an alternating sequence of shale,  
 sandstone, thin coal (not always      
 present) and limestone. The sandstone 
 has been much quarried in the past for
 local buildings and is still quarried 
 in Nenthead today. Some of the coal   
 seams are still being worked in       
 shallow drift mines along the valley  
 sides. Igneous intrusions in the form 
 of a connected series of dolerite     
 sills (the Whin Sill) were later      
 intruded into the sedimentary rocks,  
 although generally lying below the    
 surface there are two outcrops at     
 Tynehead and Cash Force. Dykes        
 associated with these intrusions      
 traverse the area in great numbers and
 many are mineralised. Valuable ores of
 lead and zinc along with smaller      
 quantities of silver, copper and iron 
 have all been extracted in the past.  </content>
