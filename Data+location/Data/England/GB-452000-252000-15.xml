		<content> Police Constable A.Blackwell Lives in 
the police House High Street Woodford  
Halse.His immediate superior is at the 
Police Station,New Street, Daventry.Mr 
Blackwell usually reports into HQ by   
two - way radio when he commences his  
tour of duty.His area of responsibility
includes,as well as Woodford,Byfield,  
Preston Capes,Canons Ashby,Adstone,and 
Maidford.However,when officers from    
neighbouring beats are off duty or on  
holiday,he has to provide some sort of 
cover for them as well.When he calls up
H.Q.,they normally give him a list of  
jobs to do including enquires to be    
followed up.When all this is completed 
he returns to his house where he has an
office and he is able to his paperwork.
He may recieve other jobs to do during 
the day through his radio which,if     
urgent,means driving off in his police 
car to the scene of the emergency.     </content>
