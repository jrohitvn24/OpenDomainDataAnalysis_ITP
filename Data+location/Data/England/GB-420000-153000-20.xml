		<title>20Pipeline Thro' Collingbourne</title>
		<content> The farmland around Collingbourne     
 Kingston and Everleigh was temporarily
 disturbed for a few months in 1985    
 whilst the Esso Petroleum Co, Ltd.,   
 had a new pipeline installed.         
 The pipeline starts at Fawley Refinery
 in Southampton and finishes at Seisdon
 near Wolverhampton, a distance of     
 approx. 130 miles.                    
 The 14" diameter pipe was laid some 4\
 feet below the surface of the ground  
 and will be used to carry petrol,     
 diesel oil and aviation kerosine.     
 Within a matter of weeks the scar_line
 across the countryside started to heal
 and the only reminders of anything    
 foreign to the earth is there, are the
 marker posts alongside roads which    
 cross the pipeline.
