		<title>02Legends of Dunston &amp; Nocton</title>
		<content> In Dunston there is a manor house     
 which has a ghost.The ghost is a baby 
 that cries every Tuesday night.It     
 cries from the first floor landing.The
 poodle Mr Sooty has also started      
 barking from time to time.Mr          
 Higginbottom said"I have felt there   
 was someone or something there on     
 occasions but I have never seen       
 anyone.I believe a servant had a      
 baby girl that died very young."      
 In Dunston there is also a headless   
 horseman that rides around the        
 church.People have heard horses hooves
 during the night.I dont think anyone  
 has ever seen it.                     
             The grey lady of Nocton is
 a woman who was the first person who  
 died in Nocton Hospital.She goes      
 around the grounds of Nocton Hospital 
 at night.I do not think anyone has    
 seen it.                              </content>
