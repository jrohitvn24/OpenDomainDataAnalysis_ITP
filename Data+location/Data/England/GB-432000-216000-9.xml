		<title>09ANIMALS OF WYCHWOOD FOREST</title>
		<content>{Fallow deer}have roamed this area     
 since before 1086. There were 1000    
 head recorded by Parliament in        
 1792.Numbers dropped after            
 disafforestation from 1860,when about 
 half the trees were felled. Today     
 their numbers are kept within         
 reasonable bounds by culling,to reduce
 destruction of woodland trees and     
 plants. Many a {King }has dined on {  
{venison }from Whychwood. In the forest
 they are unmanaged and considered {   
{vermin.}Other mammals include {       
{rabbits,hares,and grey squirrels.     
{Grass snakes,}once abundant are {     
{rarely}seen,and no{adders }have ever  
 been reported in the forest. A recent{
{invasion}has been the {Muntjac }(a    
 Chinese water deer).
