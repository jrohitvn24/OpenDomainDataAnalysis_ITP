 Chawton dates back to Saxon times.To- 
 day the parish population is about    
 500, many of the elderly having lived 
 in the village most of their lives.   
 Most of the working population is     
 employed elsewhere but until the 2nd. 
 W.W. most would have worked on local  
 estates. Several small cottages are   
 now weekend retreats for people in    
 London. A  few villagers worship at   
 the Anglican Church of St. Nicholas   
 whose rector,the Revd. Michael Tayler,
 lives and also officiates in Farring- 
 don.
