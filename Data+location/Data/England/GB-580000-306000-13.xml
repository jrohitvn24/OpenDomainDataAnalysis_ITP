		<title>13TRANSPORT IN SWAFFHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
 In Swaffham there are many kinds of   
 transport.Most people use bicycles    
 mostly the old people because they    
 can't afford to run a car also there  
 are many bus and coaches that run     
 frequently to and from Swaffham.We    
 have Clarkes coaches they are fully   
 furnished with television and video   
 and reclining chairs.They base their  
 coaches down Whitsands Road they have 
 a hard job to get the coaches out of  
 the drive since Whitsands Road is not 
 very wide.we also have Eastern        
 Counties which run from Kings Lynn to 
 Swaffham and finally to Norwich.We    
 have mini bus services round Swaffham,
 they are called Foulshams mini bus    
 hire.We have other buses come from    
 other towns and villages like Eagle,  
 Matthews and Peggs.
