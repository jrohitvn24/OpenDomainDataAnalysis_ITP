		<title>01Confluence of Test &amp; Itchen.</title>
		<content>  Our survey area was{Southampton Water
 at the confluence of the River Test   
 and River Itchen.It included some land
 on the west bank of Test,opposite the 
{docks}and a larger area of land on the
 east bank of the Itchen,where the     
 river flows into Southampton Water.   
    This inland water has{"double"tides
 which give Southampton an advantage as
 a busy passenger and cargo port.The   
{sheltered inland waterway}has also    
 been an influence on these industries 
 and has further influenced the        
 development of{shipbuilding}and       
{leisure activities}such as sailing and
 water sports in the area.The River    
 Itchen is now spanned by a bridge     
 providing an easy link between        
 Woolston and Southampton.Until the    
 bridge opened in June 1977 this river 
 could only be crossed by a Floating   
 Bridge.                               </content>
