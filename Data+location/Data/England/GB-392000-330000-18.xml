Although many British villages are     
dwindling due to lack of amenities,    
this is not so in Burston. Young       
couples are buying cottages as they are
cheap, whilst nearby towns provide     
employment within commuting distance.  
However, we heard complaints from some 
older members of the community who find
these young families are a lot noisier 
than their elderly predecessors.       
                                       
The village is unlikely to grow as     
there are two plans for development    
control in this area; a Statutory Local
Plan and a North Staffs. Plan.  As this
is a rural area there is a presumption 
against further development unless a   
need is proven. If permission is       
granted for new building it is usually 
for agricultural purposes.
