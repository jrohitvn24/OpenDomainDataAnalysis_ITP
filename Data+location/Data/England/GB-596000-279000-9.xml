		<title>09MANOR FARM, HOPTON</title>
		<content> Manor Farm is owned and run by Messers
 Phoenix, a father-son partnership.    
 They employ another man who lives six 
 miles away.  This is a mixed farm     
 rearing 32 beef cattle, 400 pigs and  
 growing winter wheat, winter barley,  
 sugar beet and carrots on 316 acres.  
 The animal's food is either brought in
 or home produced. The cattle are      
 bought from a dealer in Northampton   
 and are sold to a slaughterhouse.  The
 farmers use a combine harvester, a    
 bailer, a sugar beet harvester and 7  
 tractors.  The farmers work throughout
 the year and have two weeks annual    
 holiday, the farm worker has three    
 weeks.  The main difficulties of      
 farming are the pests and diseases.
