		<content>  The {Chichester }group  of  hospitals
 consists of {The St.Richard's and  The
{Broyle Road}branches of{The Royal West
{Sussex  Hospital  and  Graylingwell   
{Hospital.}Records show that provision 
 for  the care of  the sick &amp; infirm in
 Chichester  goes  back at least to the
 13th century.A public dispensary began
 in  1784  on  the  site of the present
 Broyle Road branch and  Thomas Bridger
 was  the  first  patient. The  present
 building dates from  1826  with later 
 additions. In 1826 the matron received
 a  wisteria  plant from  China.  It is
 now  the  largest  and  oldest  in the
 country and adorns  the facade  of the
 hospital.  St.Richards opened it  1939
 and has developed with additions to be
 an  accident  and  emergency hospital.
 Graylingwell  opened  in  1897  as the
 hospital  for  mental illness in  West
 Sussex &amp; now has day care facilities. </content>
