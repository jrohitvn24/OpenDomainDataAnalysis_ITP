		<title>06Industry in Haddenham</title>
		<content> Until WW2 most people in Haddenham    
 were employed in{agriculture}and its  
 connected industries. The agricultural
 slump in the 1870s forced people to   
 move out of the area.{Modern industry 
{has grown since 1945.}There are now   
{three large companies,}two medium     
 sized companies and several smaller   
 firms. All the{industry is 'light',}  
 and mainly engineering. Many companies
 chose to move to Haddenham because    
{property was cheap,}and the work force
 skilled. Companies such as Airtech    
 moved to the village to be{near the   
{air-field}which was used extensivly in
 the War.                              
{Access by road}to London, Oxford, St  
 Albans, Amersham and Aylesbury is     
 good, but there is no railway station.
