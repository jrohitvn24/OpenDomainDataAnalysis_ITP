		<content>{Downton Band}has been going for many  
 years. It used to be called Downton   
 Silver Band but it is now called the  
 Downton Huntsman Band. The band goes  
 to contests in Southampton, Bristol,  
 Poole and Weymouth. They have already 
 played at the Royal Albert Hall in    
 London and come 4th out of 95 bands.  
 There is a Junior section in the band.
 Matthew Bowen, in our class, is in it;
 he plays the trombone. He says he is  
 not sure whether he likes it or not.  
 Altogether the Senior band has won 8  
 cups and 2 shields. The Band also     
 plays at shows like the Bath and West,
 the Cuckoo Fair, the church Fete and  
 the New Forest Show. They rehearse in 
 the band hall near our school on      
 Mondays and Wednesdays.
