		<content>  Wetherby's Mayor is a councillor.    
 He is elected by a secret ballot of   
 the Council to be Chairman of the     
 Council and Mayor. His job involves   
 chairing Council Meetings and the     
 Finance Committee, representing the   
 town and other roles such as opening  
 fetes and new buildings. He receives  
 no salary and few expenses, but an    
 official car is available for his use.
                                       
 The present Mayor also has a          
 full-time job as a local doctor. He

 overruled by the Leeds City Council or
 the Courts. The Mayor and Mayoress

 silver and is insured for Â£1,000. The 
 original Chains date back to 1894, but
 the present ones were donated in 1936.
