		<title>08The Market Gardener's Day</title>
		<content>    My dad is a market gardener. He    
 grows{cabbages, lettuce, cauliflowers,
{potatoes, sprouts, onions}and         
{calabrese.}His day starts at{5:00}when
 he goes out into the field to cut     
{cauliflowers}and{cabbages}for market. 
 At{9:00}he has a cup of coffee before 
 starting the planting. My dad has his 
 dinner at{1:00}and he usually goes to 
 sleep for an hour. When he wakes up he
 goes to market in{Cheltenham.}On      
 returning from market at{3:30}he      
 continues with the planting until     
{5:30.}All the family have tea then,   
 and after tea my dad turns on the     
{irrigation system}if it is dry. When  
 he has finished that job he comes in  
 and watches television until{10:00}and
 then he goes to bed.                  
    All the crops he grows are graded  
 in class I, II or III as set by the   
{EEC}and are sold to a local market.   </content>
