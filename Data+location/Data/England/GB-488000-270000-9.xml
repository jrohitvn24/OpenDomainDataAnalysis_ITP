		<content> Mulso Junior School made a survey     
among parents and grandparents of its  
present pupils.We asked four questions.
  1. Do you work in Finedon?           
  2. If not, where?                    
  3. How do you travel to work?        
  4. What kind of job do you do?       
 Grandparents were asked to give       
answers for the time they first began  
work.                                  
 The results show a big difference in  
all respects.86% of grandparents worked
in Finedon,mostly in the shoe and      
clothing factories.These walked to     
work.Only 28% of parents now work in   
Finedon,58% work in near by towns,and  
14% travel.74% of parents use private  
transport exclusively to travel to     
work.Only one regularly uses a local   
bus.Manufacturing industries account   
for only 38% of the workers,most       
parents are in service industries.     </content>
