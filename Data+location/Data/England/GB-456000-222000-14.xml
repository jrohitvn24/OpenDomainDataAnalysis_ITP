		<content>The former cinema has been converted   
into a Bingo hall which has very       
popular sessions most evenings.Dances, 
whist drives, tombola sessions,        
musical and dramatic performances all  
take place at various halls in town.   
There is a large number of pubs in     
Bicester which serve food and have     
gardens open to the public.There are   
also Chinese and Indian restaurants in 
the centre of town.                    
There are two Youth clubs, one of them 
is run by the Methodist church.The     
Catholic Youth club closed down        
recently.The scouts and guides also    
have troops in the town and are popular
with many of the younger residents.
