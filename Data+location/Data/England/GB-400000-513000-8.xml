		<title>08Hulands Brick Works</title>
		<content>  Hulands Brick Works,owned by Mr.J.M. 
 Wearmouth,occupies 28 acres of land   
 which once belonged to British Rail.  
 The works were built next to Hulands  
 Quarry which is now disused.A railway 
 spur formerly provided transport.     
  The business has been the same size  
 for the past 15 years,producing an    
 average of{100,000 bricks}per week.The
 works employs 7 men and has 3 lorries 
 used for distribution,which varies    
 from local trade to deliveries as far 
 apart as Berwick in the north,and York
 and Scarborough to the east.The trucks
 return with dust and cement for the   
 concrete bricks.They are also used for
 miscellaneous haulage.                
  In 1985 an up-to-date alarm system   
 was installed.This is an infra-red    
 light-sensitive device to stop the    
 frequent thefts of diesel fuel,wheels 
 and batteries from the lorries.       </content>
