		<content> St.Andrews  church  was  originally  a
 Norman  building  built  in  the  13th
 century.On the 11th of January  1689  
 towards  dawn ,there was a violent    
 storm  continuing  to about 11 or 12  
 at night.It blew down a great elm     
 tree,sold afterwards for ten pounds   
 which was a great amount of money in  
 those days.The tree hit the roof and  
 damaged most of the roof.The church   
 took 6 months to repair.In the year   
 1856 it was decided that there        
 should be a new church built on the   
 old site.On October 7th the church was
 finished and it cost about Â£1,500.The 
 builder of the new church was a man   
 called Mr.John Crook.The present vicar
 is also vicar of Plaitford.There is   
 a family service at Landford on the   
 first sunday of the month, and        
 evensong on the other three sundays.
