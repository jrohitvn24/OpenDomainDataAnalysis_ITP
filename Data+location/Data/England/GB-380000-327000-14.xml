		<title>14The Trade of Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Eccleshall boasts a choice of butchers
 greengrocers, newsagents, clothing,   
 antiques and take-away food shops; and
 in addition to the expected dairy,    
 bakery, hardware, drug and craft shops
 there are provisions for pets, sports,
 betting, a shoe shop and cobblers. It 
 is also possible to have most services
 rendered since there is also a dentist
 optician, osteopath, veterinary       
 surgeon and vehicle repairers, while  
 three agricultural establishments     
 supply farmers. A number of people    
 work from home: plumbers, decorators, 
 electricians, builders and heating    
 engineers, who make the community very
 self-sufficient. The fact that many of
 the businesses are family, or family  
 partnerships, explains the friendly   
 atmosphere in the shops, all of which 
 are centres for meeting friends and   
 chatting, in typical country fashion. </content>
