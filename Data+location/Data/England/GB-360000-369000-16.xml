		<title>16PETTYPOOL LAKE, WHITEGATE</title>
		<content> Pettypool is mainly woodland, full of 
 wildlife and insects.  There is a     
 large lake with wooden jetties used   
 for fishing and sailing.  Guides, Cubs
 and Scouts camp at Pettypool.  The    
 only access is by walking down a long 
 path through the trees but this is    
 very beautiful.  No cars can go       
 through the wood so it is safe for    
 children.  The lake and trees are     
 surrounded by Sandiway Golf Club      
 course and fields.  The fields belong 
 to Pettyypool farm, which is close by.
 The Golf Club has pumping equipment   
 and is allowed to use some of the     
 water from the Pettypool Lake to water
 the golf greens.                      
 The area is an important conservation 
 area and has been kept in its natural 
 state.  There are no facilites        
 available but the farm can be of use  
 to campers.                           </content>
