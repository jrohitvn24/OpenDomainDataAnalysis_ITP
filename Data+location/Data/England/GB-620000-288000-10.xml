		<title>10WILDLIFE HARDWICK AREA</title>
		<content> The area is rich in wildlife,farmland 
 &amp; woodland birds abound,there are more
 owls now,&amp; marsh harrier seen.Wood-   
 peckers seen &amp; heard also plenty of   
 summer &amp; autumn migrants.People are   
 interested in protecting birds,feeding
 them in winter &amp; providing nest boxes 
 &amp; areas of bushes &amp; rough grass.RSPB  
 members help in the annual sponsored  
 birdwatch.Animal life includes hares  
 rabbits,grey squirrels,hedgehogs,bats 
 stoats,weasels &amp; shrews.A grass snake 
 was seen but few frogs or toads.It's  
 been a good year for dragonflies,     
 butterflies &amp; bees-few wasps.There are
 still plenty of wild flowers-cowslips 
 &amp; primroses in Springtime. Large      
 numbers of other species survive      
 in field borders &amp; waste land,but     
 sadly many roadside verge plants have 
 disappeared particularly Wild Orchids 
 as ditches &amp; hedgerows are sprayed.   </content>
