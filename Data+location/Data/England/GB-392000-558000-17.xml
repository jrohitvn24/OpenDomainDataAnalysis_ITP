		<title>17Our 1985 Home</title>
		<content> Although my family has lived in       
 Hexhamshire for generations,{our new  
{bungalow}was only completed in        
{1985}.The foundations were dug in May 
 1984,and while the building was going 
 on,my parents, my brother and I all   
 lived in a caravan on the site.We were
 lucky that the winter was so mild.    
  {Building}went fairly smoothly, but  
 at times it was tiring, as we were    
 doing some of the jobs ourselves. At  
 one time I felt my mother would always
 have a paintbrush in her hand! The    
 house is built of thermalite blocks,  
 clad in local stone, some of which    
 came from an old building on my       
 grandfather's farm.It has many{energy 
{saving}features,{insulation}in        
 the  walls and loft, and under the    
 floor,{double-glazing},and a boiler   
 which can burn most fuels. We are very
 proud of our{1985}home! M.Stewart     </content>
