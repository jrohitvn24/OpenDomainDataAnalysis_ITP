		<title>09A Day in my Life</title>
		<content> Two of the children in the class have 
 written about a day they enjoyed.     
  One Saturday morning I got up. It was
 very sunny we were going to{Ferry}    
{Meadows.}We were going in the car with
 my mum and dad and my sister. We took 
 a picnic and a ball to play with. When
 we got there we got out of the car. My
 sister ran away and we didn't notice  
 that she had gone. We went to look for
 her. We were very worried. We looked  
 for her for twenty minutes. Then we   
 found her. She was hiding behind a    
 bush! Then we went to have a picnic.  
 We had sandwiches, biscuits and cakes.
 After that we went fishing.           
  You can read about another day on    
 page ten and more about leisure on    
 pages twelve and thirteen.
