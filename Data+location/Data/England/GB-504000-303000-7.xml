		<title>07BARNACK HILLS AND HOLES</title>
		<content> On Thursday the 11th of July we went  
 to the Hills and Holes. We started off
 where the quarry used to be.The quarry
 was last used in 1450. Now that stone 
 is under the Barnack Drift. There are 
 sheep,lots of gates and stiles and    
 lots of trees and hawthorn shrubs.    
 Soon they will have to remove some to 
 make some more room for the flowers   
 to grow. Many species have survived   
 here. Mr Lewin looks after a part of  
 the hills and holes. He showed us some
 of the flowers.In half an hour we     
 found:- Hair Bell,Yellow Bed Straw,   
 Rock Rose,Purple Clover,Pyramid Orchid
 Birds Foot Trefoil,Kidney Vetch,Totter
 Grass, Ribb Plantain, Horey Plantain, 
 Drop Wort,Jack Goes To Bed At Noon,   
 Wild Parsnip,Common Vetch,Bee orchid. 
 There were lots of other flowers but  
 we didnt have time to see them.
