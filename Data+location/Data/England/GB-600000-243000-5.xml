		<title>05KERSEY</title>
		<content>  Kersey is built in a v-shaped        
valley. It is unusual because it is    
built across the valley and not along  
it.This means that the main village    
street has very steep sides with the   
buildings on the slope.                
  In the centre of Kersey is a ford    
were the River Brett runs through the  
village.                               
  Many of the buildings have oak       
timber frames these are filled with    
clay,straw and hazel twigs (wattle and 
daub)which are protected by plastering.
On some of the plaster you can see     
patterns,this is called pargetting.Most
of the houses are thatched which was   
the earliest material used.The pantiles
came next,followed by the slate.Nearly 
all the buildings date from between the
fifteenth and seventeenth centuries.
