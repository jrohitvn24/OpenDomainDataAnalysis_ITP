		<title>04Farming in NE Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>The farmland of the North-East edge of 
Wolverhampton is spread over seven     
small farms, whose buildings are       
usually old-looking, but well kept.It  
is bordered by the urban sprawl of     
several housing estates. It is also    
bisected by a large number of paths,   
lanes, main roads and a disused mineral
railway. The land is well managed,     
being used for a mixed pattern of      
arable farming. Cereal crops           
predominate. We saw mainly barley,with 
some fields of wheat. Oil-seed rape is 
also grown and there are several fields
of grass. Silage and hay are both grown
for sale and to feed herds of Hereford 
and Friesian beef cattle. We noticed a 
few Charolais beef animals too. Some   
vegetables and potatoes are being grown
but we thought it was strange that more
vegatables are not grown so near to a  
town.                                  </content>
