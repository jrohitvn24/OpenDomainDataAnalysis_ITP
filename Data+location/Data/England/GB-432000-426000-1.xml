		<title>01TRANSPORT AROUND ROTHWELL</title>
		<content> The whole area is bounded on the west 
 side by the major motorway network in 
 the north of England. At Lofthouse    
 there is the M1/M62 interchange on    
 which an average, is used by 1370     
 vehicles per hour. The Lofthouse      
 interchange is built on three levels, 
 the lower level being the north/south 
 M1 from Leeds to London, the          
 intermediate level is the east/west   
 M62 from Hull to Manchester. The      
 busiest motorway is the westbound M62 
 towards Manchester. Following a       
 mid-morning survey it was found that  
 approximatley 1215 vehicles per hour  
 used this motorway at its Lofthouse   
 point, most vehicles being heavy      
 goods.In the past the area was        
 criss-crossed with thriving railway   
 lines, these have been dismantled.    
 Theses lines were the transportation  
 system for local pits and brickworks. </content>
