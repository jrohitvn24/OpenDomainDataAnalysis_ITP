		<title>11SHOPPING FACILITIES</title>
		<content> There are only two shops in our area. 
 One at Brown's Garage and one at Duton
 Hill.We did a survey asking which are 
 the main shopping areas people use.   
 Dunmow and Bishop's Stortford were the
 most popular.Some people buy their    
 daily needs from mobile shops.There   
 are seven different types.They are:   
 Milkman,Video van,Ice-cream,          
 Fruit'n'Veg, Baker,Fish'n'Chip van and
 the Mobile Library. Each delivery or  
 Mobile shop,has its own type of       
 vehicle specially made for the job.   
 Some come in the morning, some in the 
 afternoon.The Milkman,Postman, and    
 Paper boy come to the door, others    
 stop in a certain place and customers 
 go to them.Some delivery people wear a
 uniform,Postman, Milkman, Baker, ice  
 cream and Fish'n'Chips do,the others  
 don't.
