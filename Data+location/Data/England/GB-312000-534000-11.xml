		<title>11RECREATION in Blindcrake</title>
		<content>  The Moota Motel complex includes     
 squash courts as well as bars and     
 dancing. Thre is little else generally
 available apart from the two pubs. One
 pub is very small, a dozen customers  
 and it is bursting at the seams!      
 Nevertheless it has hosted domino     
 competitions.                         
  The Womens Institute and Mothers     
 Union meet once a month for talks and 
 slideshows etc, with the WI having    
 craft type competitions. About 20     
 ladies normally attend.               
  The Childrens Committee organises    
 Halloween and Christmas parties for   
 the children and the Village Outing is
 extreemly well patronised.            
  Keep fit classes meet once a week in 
 winter.                               
  All functions are in the Mission     
 Rooms in Blindcrake.
