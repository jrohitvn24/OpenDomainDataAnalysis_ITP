		<title>10TEIGNMOUTH'S DOCKS</title>
		<content> The Docks started in the 13th century 
 with salt production and grew in the  
 16th century with Newfoundland fish.  
 Around 1740 ball clay from Bovey      
 Tracey was exported and in the 19th   
 century Dartmoor granite was shipped  
 to London (for the Bridge).           
   Today the Quay Co. employs about 60 
 men and the docks handle about 550    
 ships each year. Winter is the busiest
 time and so is the start of each      
 week.210,000 out of 246,000 tonnes of 
 exports are clay which goes to        
 Rotterdam for distribution.           
   Imports total is 472,000 tonnes, of 
 which 197,000 is animal feed and      
 112,000 was coal in 1984 because of   
 the strike.                           
   The Docks are probably the biggest  
 source of employment in the town being
 used by lorries from 50 local firms.  
 Some locals object to dust and noise. </content>
