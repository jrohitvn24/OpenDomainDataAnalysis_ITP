		<title>12THE FIVE CABINET MAKERS.</title>
		<content>{The Five Cabinet Makers}are one of 3  
 businesses on a site in the {West End 
{of Clevedon.}They employ five people  
 and do not only make cabinets.They    
 make spice racks and various other    
 things.They have also made feet       
 steadiers for handicapped people to   
 keep their feet straight on           
 wheelchairs.They send their products  
 all round England and even to America.
 Clevedon is a good place to set up a  
 business because the motorway is so   
 near for transporting goods.It is also
 near big places like Bristol and      
 Weston.                               
 The business has been going in        
 Clevedon for about 25 years.They have 
 plans to expand but are not sure when 
 this will be.
