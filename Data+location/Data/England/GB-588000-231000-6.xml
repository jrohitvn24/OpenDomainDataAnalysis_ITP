		<title>06Farming An Arable Farm</title>
		<content>    Yesterday we went to visit a large 
 arable farm which was about 250 Acres 
 in area.  The fields were spread about
 the countryside and not in a single   
 block.                                
    The farmer is both the owner and   
 the manager.   Wheat, barley, oats and
 spring beans are his most important   
 crops.  Most of the land is given over
 to wheat as this is the most          
 profitable crop.  The type grown, as  
 we found on most farms in the area, is
 hard wheat, which is a fodder crop.   
    The farmers most busy time is from 
 July to October when he harvests his  
 crops and prepares the ground for next
 season's crops.   Most farmers sell to
 merchants who take samples of the crop
 and who then arrange transport in bulk
 lorries direct from the farm.
