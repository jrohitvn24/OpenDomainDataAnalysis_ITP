		<content> There are many{farms}in{              
{Threemilestone.                       
 They are mostly mixed farms.The farms 
 are mainly named after their owners.  
 They mostly have sheep, cows, pigs,   
 horses and other livestock. Most of   
 the farms have got a certain aspect on
 farming: some are crops, animals or   
 just hay or silage  to sell to other  
 farmers.Some  farms have milking cows 
 and we have got twenty_nine farms     
 aproximately in our area.Most of our  
 area is land.Most of our group have   
 some relatives on a{farm.}The         
 owners of{Westleigh Farm}give jobs to 
 mentally handicapped people on the    
 farm,which is a very good idea, the   
 farming group think. We have found    
 out about many types of farms and ways
 of working on a farm.
