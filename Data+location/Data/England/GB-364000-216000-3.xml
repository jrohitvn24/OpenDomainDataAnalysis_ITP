		<content>    The Coal Measures in the west of   
 the area are largely covered with     
 forests, with some open areas of      
 disturbed ground from former mining   
 activities. The limestone and         
 sandstone ridges have large fields of 
 pasture, with the best farmland in the
 Mitcheldean valley. The two main built
 up areas are the tiny, compact town of
 Mitcheldean, with its large factory,  
 and the large Forest village of       
 Drybrook. The other main settlements  
 are at Harrow Hill and Plump Hill,    
 both of which are typical "squatter"  
 type settlements, originated by people
 claiming a right to a piece of land   
 under ancient Forest laws. The result 
 is a landscape of stone cottages      
 dotted haphazardly over the hillsides.
 Building stone is the Forest stone    
 from the Coal Measures, with Old Red  
 Sandstone used around Mitcheldean.    </content>
