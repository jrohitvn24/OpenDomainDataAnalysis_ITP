		<title>02Our Visit to Cattows Farm</title>
		<content> Most of the farms near Heather are    
 quite big.  At one time many of them  
 had big herds of milking cows.  Today 
 some have changed to stock-rearing and
 arable farming.  We visited Cattows   
 Farm and we found out that the farmer 
 had to get up early to feed the       
 cattle.  They dont have any milking   
 cows any more, and in the summer      
 months they spend a lot of time doing 
 jobs in the fields.  In spring time   
 they are busy fencing and spreading   
 fertilizer on the grass.  In the early
 summer they start harvesting the      
 silage, and the cattle are "wormed" so
 that they stay healthy.  They have    
 three hundred Friesian and Hereford   
 cows on the farm.  They grow barley,  
 hay and wheat.  The farmer and his    
 brother work the farm.  Altogether    
 they have 275 acres.
