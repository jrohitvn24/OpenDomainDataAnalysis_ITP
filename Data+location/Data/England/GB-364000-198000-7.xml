		<title>07SEVERN HOUSE FARM, BERKELEY</title>
		<content> Sheltered behind the Severn Sea Wall  
 lies the Silverthorn Family Farm which
 is a{mixed business}with a herd of 267
{Friesian}cows and 3 happy{Hereford    
 bulls. The crops grown are wheat,     
 barley and maize, taking up 400 of the
 650 acre farm.                        
{Chemicals}play an important part on   
 the land at a time when other farmers 
 are engaged in developing{organic     
 methods.                              
 The working day for the family and the
 four employees begins at 6.30am and   
 often ends as late as 10pm, seven days
 a week. The weekly rewards for these  
 long hours can vary from{Â£80 to Â£1000.
 The family including the goldfish,    
 cats and dogs, enjoy this way of life.
 This concern has also been hit by     
 milk quotas when{The Third World      
 peoples are suffering from famine and 
 malnutrition.                         </content>
