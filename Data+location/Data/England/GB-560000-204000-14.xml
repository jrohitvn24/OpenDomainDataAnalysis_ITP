		<title>14MY HOUSE AT RADLEY GREEN</title>
		<content> The house I live in was once part of a
 terrace of farm workers' cottages.We  
 live in accommodation built for 2 fam-
 ilies.When my parents bought the      
 houses 8 years ago they had been empty
 for 2 years.The Council had said they 
 were not fit for occupation.They were 
 in a terrible state.My Dad is a sur-  
 veyor so he knew what had to be done. 
 Inside there was just one tap for cold
 water.A hole in the wall was the drain
 The toilet was a bucket in the garden 
 shed.The floors were rotten.The out-  
 side walls had to be re-rendered,the  
 inside walls replastered,some walls   
 were knocked down,hot and cold water, 
 bathroom and toilets put in.The garden
 was dug up to put in a septic tank and
 drains.While this work was done we    
 lived in an old caravan.I was 6 months
 old then.Work was finally finished 2  
 years later when my brother was born. </content>
