		<content>{Sport in Escrick                      
 Several sports are enjoyed in the     
 area.The Cricket Club,believed to have
 been founded in 1880 plays in the     
 delightful setting of Escrick Park.   
 Tennis may be played at Queen         
 Margaret's School,where there is also 
 an excellent riding school.There is   
 even a village walk which takes place 
 several times a year.                 
{Arts and Crafts}                      
 The York University Gilbert and       
 Sullivan Choir recently gave a concert
 in St. Helen's Church.The Village Hall
 Committee organises an annual "Music  
 Hall" when those village groups who   
 wish to participate perform for three 
 evenings;these productions are always 
 sold out.The Women's Institute        
 occasionally make their own           
 entertainment,and read poetry,e.g. at 
 Christmas.                            </content>
