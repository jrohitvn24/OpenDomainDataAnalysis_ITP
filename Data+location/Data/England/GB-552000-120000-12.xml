		<content>{Noughts and Crosses }There are two    
 teams of ten people. One team is      
 noughts and the other crosses.You set 
 out nine chairs for the game.The first
 person of one of the teams sits in one
 of the chairs ,then the first person  
 of the other team sits on another     
 chair.The first team to get three     
 people sitting in a row, vertically,  
 horizontally  or diagonally is the    
 winner.{Pin the tail on the donkey    
 Each person in turn is blindfolded and
 tries to pin the tail in the right    
 place on the donkey.The one nearest to
 the right place wins.{Hide and Seek   
 One person is chosen to be "it" and   
 she counts to a certain number,say a  
 100.While she is counting the other   
 people go and hide.When she has       
 finished counting she shouts "Coming  
 ready or not".The first one to be     
 found is "it" next go.(Tracey Beardon)</content>
