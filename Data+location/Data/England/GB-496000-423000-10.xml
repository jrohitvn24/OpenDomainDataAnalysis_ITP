		<title>10THE ENVIRONMENT AND FERRIBY.</title>
		<content>    North Ferriby is a "dormitory      
 village" for Hull.Its growth is       
 restricted to the North by the A63,   
 to the East by farmland, to the South 
 by the River Humber,and to the West by
 a green belt ("The Plantations").The  
 village has a lot of houses so it is  
 becoming crowded.Residents want to    
 stop or limit more houses being       
 built.However people would like some  
 things to be built such as a bigger   
 library because the existing one is   
 too small. They would like a bank so  
 that they do not have to go to Hessle 
 or Hull. When people shop in the      
 village they say they need a car park 
 and also a supermarket to replace Fine
 Fare, which is no longer in the       
 village.Some old people say they would
 like to live in bungalows.
