		<content> The centrepiece of this block is the  
 main public access to Regent's Park   
 from Marylebone Road and Regent's Park
 tube station at the S. In summer,     
 crowds stream into the park to enjoy  
 the gardens, lakes and sports         
 facilities.  Prominent in the John    
 Nash plan (1811-1828) is the Inner    
 Circle, containing Queen Mary's       
 gardens.  Park Crescent leads to Port-
 land Place and eventually to West-    
 minster, an early piece of town       
 planning. Other attractions are Mme   
 Tussauds and the Planetarium.Education
 establishments include Bedford College
 and several music colleges. To the    
 E of the block are many houses and    
 flats including Nash's elegant Chester
 Terrace.  At one time a branch of the 
 Regent's Canal ended here.Now the E of
 the block contains shops and houses.It
 is not just a tourist area.           </content>
