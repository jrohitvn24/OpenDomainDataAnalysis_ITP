 years.  It used to be an outfitting   
 shop.  The opening hours are 9.00am to

 over the years.                       
 There are four people working in the  
 shop and the owner has been running   
 the business for 23 years.  Business  
 is good at the moment and the most    
 common sales items are decorating     
 materials.  Monday is a good sales day
