		<content>   Mr.Sheppard is a grey-haired,       
 talkative,{elderly local historian.}He
 believes that life has progressed too 
 quickly in too short a time. He does  
 not want to see the{"green belt"}being
 destroyed. He is Vice-President of the
 local Residents Association in order  
 to put his ideas into practice. He    
 thinks that a{father no longer has a  
{respected position in the family}and  
 that this is a pity.                  
   Mrs. Osgood runs the{Pixham Post    
{Office}with her husband. The shop     
 opens at 6a.m.(for newspapers) and    
 shuts at 6.30 p.m.It opens daily, but 
 Wednesdays and Sundays are half days. 
   The shop is a Sub Post Office.It    
 can provide most{daily needs for the  
{pensioners and young couples}who live 
 nearby.Together with the church it    
 plays a big part in a little          
 community.                            </content>
