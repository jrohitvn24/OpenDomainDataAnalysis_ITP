		<title>15A SCHOOLBOY'S DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 I wake up at around 6 o'clock and lie 
 in bed for half an hour until I get   
 up, go downstairs and get changed into
 my school uniform. I leave for the    
 shop, where they lay out the papers   
 for me to collect. I have roughly     
 forty papers to deliver all round my  
 area and it takes me around 45        
 minutes. Once I get home, I have my   
 breakfast of high fibre cereals and   
 then watch breakfast television until 
 I leave for school at about 8.20 am   
 and reach school about 25 minutes     
 later when we go in for registration. 
 At school our subjects range from     
 physical education to needlework.     
 School ends at 3.40 pm. When I get    
 home i watch television or play       
 football until about 6.00 pm when I   
 have my tea. Normally, I go to sleep  
 at between 10 and 11 pm.              </content>
