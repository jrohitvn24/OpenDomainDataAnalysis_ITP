		<title>04ALDENHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content> The village of {Aldenham}is mentioned 
 in the Domesday book and there was    
 probably an earlier Saxon church on   
 the site of the Parish Church of      
 St John the Baptist.  The tower and   
 Lady Chapel are 12th Century and the  
 nave 14th.   The use of{Hertfordshire 
{Puddingstone}in the tower construction
 is an exceptional feature.  The church
 is asymmetrical, with the nave not    
 central to the altar; the north door  
 is not directly under its arch and the
 capitals on some of the pillars are at
 different heights.                    
 The Church has a fine choir, mentioned
 in Kilminster's "The Good Church      
 Guide".  The 8 a.m. Holy Communion is 
 celebrated every Sunday, except the   
 first of the month.  Sung Eucharist is
 at 10.15 every other Sunday and Matins
 on the other.  Sung Evensong is at    
 6.30 p.m. every Sunday.               </content>
