		<content> Hatfield Peverel is not a             
 particularly pretty village but it is 
 a busy village with a friendly        
 atmosphere. There is a Village Hall   
 where many activities take place, it  
 was built between 1980 and 1982.      
 Villagers were asked if they could    
 help in anyway to complete the hall.  
 The roof,  lighting, painting and     
 decorating were all done by the       
 villagers. Also many fund raising     
 activities were organised in the      
 village, such as  'Brick Bond Raffles'
 to help meet the cost. In September   
 1982 the Village Hall was opened by   
 Admiral Sir Andrew Lewis. The Village 
 Hall contains a large hall, and a     
 stage, a small meeting room, a bar and
 snooker room and toilets. Plans for   
 extending the Village Hall are at     
 present in progress. The Village Hall 
 is very well used by all ages.        </content>
