		<content>Two surveys were carried out 1)in the  
Shiremoor area and 2)the Killingworth  
area. The results were very similar.   
90%of the people enjoyed living in     
their area because it was "central"i.e.
near to the coast on the one hand and  
yet close to the city of Newcastle with
its major shopping centre,Eldon Square 
the largest indoor shopping centre in  
Europe.                                
In(1) the people liked the "village"   
effect left over from the mining       
days,the friendly neighbours and the   
nearness to the country.               
In(2) the majority liked the traffic   
free garths,the modern housing and the 
young,friendly people but many thought 
the place was insular,a concrete city  
(reference to the tower blocks)and had 
reputation.Vandelism and grafitti were 
a common concern in both area.
