     THE{CHURCH}AT STANTON-BY-DALE HAS 
                                       
 A TOWER AND ON THE NORTH SIDE THERE   
 ARE THREE STONE CROSSES  BUILT INTO   
 THE WALL.  ON THE WEST SIDE THERE IS A
 SPIRTUAL CROSS WHICH WAS BUILT IN     
 1872.  THE OLDEST GRAVESTONE IN THE   
 YARD IS FROM 1806.  THE CHURCH ITSELF 
 IS CALLED SAINT MICHAELS AND ALL      
 ANGELS PARISH CHURCH,FROM THE CHURCH  
 OF ENGLAND.                           
    THE PORCH OF THE CHURCH IS VERY OLD
 AS IT IS WEATHER BEATEN.  ABOVE THE   
 CHURCH THERE IS A SUN DIAL MADE FROM  
 SAND STONE AND IT IS ABOUT THIRTY     
 CENTIMETRES IN DIAMETER,  BUT THE DIAL
 DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE IT IS IN THE    
 SHADE.
