		<title>15CLIFTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Approached from the green, one first 
 sees the 18th century{DOVECOTE}on the 
 village green and the blacksmith's    
 forge behind the police station.To one
 side of the green there are the {     
{ALMSHOUSES,}built in 1709.On the other
 side stands the {NATIONAL SCHOOL,}the 
 school{HEADMASTER'S HOUSE}and 19th    
 century dwellings.Walking across the  
 green into the heart of the village   
 one passes the {RECTORY,}now an old   
 peoples home,a few thatched cottages  
 and some victorian dwellings, before  
 arriving at the 11th century {CHURCH  
  and {CLIFTON HALL}with it's dower    
 house and extensive stables.          
 The planners have carefully retained  
 character in the village by the       
 introduction of discreet infilling    
 of houses of pleasing design.
