		<title>18      CROYDON HALL</title>
		<content> Croydon Hall is a big boarding school.
 All the children come from Bristol.   
 The headmaster tries to make the      
 children feel at home . They have a   
 swimming pool and you can see it from 
 one of the boys bedroom window. They  
 are allowed in the swimming pool      
 every evening and afternoon.In the    
 common room there is a carved mantle  
 piece. Each  bedroom door has a name. 
 The children decided to call the      
 bedrooms after the names of birds     
 like kingfisher, sparrow, hawk, yellow
 hammer, humming bird, bluetit and so  
 on. Out of the windows you can see    
 quite a nice view of hills. There are 
 forty one children in the whole school
 and most of them go home on weekends  
 to their parents. The headmaster takes
 them in the minibus. Most of the      
 children have a teddy bear or some    
 kind of cuddly toy.                   </content>
