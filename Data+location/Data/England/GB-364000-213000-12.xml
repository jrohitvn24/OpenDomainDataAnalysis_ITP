		<title>12Visit to the Police Station</title>
		<content> I went to the police station. The     
 policeman took us into a room where   
 paper work was. Then the policeman    
 took us to a room with a camera. The  
 police take photographs of bad        
 people. The policeman said that he    
 would bring his motorbike over to the 
 school to show us. We saw the cells   
 and some boys were locked in. Noami   
 had a go on the personal radio. She   
 said "What is your name?" and a       
 policeman replied "I don't know." The 
 policeman showed us his uniform and   
 his truncheon. His uniform is black.  
 It has a silver chain with a whistle  
 on the end. In the police car there   
 were bollards.
