		<title>12A Boy's Day</title>
		<content>I get up at 7.30am. get dressed and go 
down for a cup of coffee. At 8.30am. I 
get my 5-speed racing cycle and ride to
school. It takes about 10 minutes. The 
boys play football till 9.00am. when   
we go into lessons.We first do mental  
arithmetic then maths.At 9.45 we go to 
prayers till 10.00. Half an hour later 
is play.Most boys play football each   
play. 10.00 means some English work    
until lunch at noon.The afternoon      
starts at 1.pm. and we have different  
lessons each day. We have a short      
break at 2.30. School ends at 3.30pm.  
 Once I am home I watch television     
until 5.30 when the family has tea.    
Afterwards I use my Commodore 64       
computer until 7.30 when I watch TV    
again until my bedtime at 10.30 pm.    
Soon another day starts.
