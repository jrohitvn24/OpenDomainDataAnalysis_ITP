		<title>11 CONTRASTING LAND-USES (1)</title>
		<content>{A Walk along " Park Lug" from G.R. SU 
{539157 to SU 536170. }                
 Park Lug is an ancient field boundary,
 possibly related to the Village of    
 Bihop's Waltham and the Palace of the 
 Bishop of Winchester located there.   
 Today it a very marked feature on the 
 landscape comprising a broad ditch    
 flanked by a line of trees. It also   
 marks an interesting line between two 
 contrasting farming types. East of the
 Lug, most of the hedgerows shown on   
 the 1973 OS map still exist. Many of  
 the fields are therefore small , and  
 mainly grassed - not always free of   
 weeds. Beef farming dominates. West of
 the Lug, even the few hedges marked on
 the O.S. map have gone and the copse  
 at G.R.535165 has been much reduced.  
 Arable farming is the system in use   
 with large fields of oil-seed rape    
 and cereals dominating the scene.     </content>
