I'm off to school at 8.20 and I arrive 
at school at 8.35.At 9.00 I go in for  
lessons and at 10.30 the bell goes for 
playtime.I go out and eat my snack.The 
whistle goes and we have to come in.At 
10.50 lessons start again.Lessons are  
until 12.00 and then dinner time comes.
I eat my sandwiches and go out onto the
field.                                 
I go in at 1.25 and have my afternoon  
lessons.Again the bell goes for break  
at 2.25 which ends at 2.40.I come in   
for our last lesson;it's always        
something good.We go home at 3.40 and I
