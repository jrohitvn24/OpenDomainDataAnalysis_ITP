		<content> Situated on the eastern side of the   
 village, Northants County Council     
 bought the old sand pit workings.  It 
 was derelict land with some water but 
 no trees.  The site was 32 acres, and 
 5 of these acres are being used for   
 the new by-pass.  Hawthorn trees are  
 being planted, meadow, grass, picnic  
 areas and a car park.  The new by-pass
 will have a service road to it. Trees 
 will be planted by schools and the WI.
 Hopefully wild life, insects etc, will
 flourish and there will be a nature   
 walk through{Fermyn Woods.}Wildlife   
 found in the area: pheasant, french   
 partridge, collared dove, rabbits,    
 hares, foxes, weasels and some deer.  
 During the 1939-45 war American troops
 stationed in Boughton Park            
 accidentally released the Dukes herd  
 of deer which took to the woods and   
 footprints betray their presence today</content>
