		<title>03Nanjizel House, St. Levan</title>
		<content> Nanjizel house is the only building in
 this Domeday Block. It was built about
 the turn of the century for a member  
 of the St. Aubyn family, the major    
 landowners in St. Levan, as a holiday 
 home. Eventually it became part of    
 Bosistow Farm and was eventually sold 
 into private ownership. For much of   
 its time Nanjizel House has remained  
 empty; difficulty of access over two  
 kilometres of unmade track has meant  
 it has not been popular as a family   
 home. However in recent years it has  
 been used by a family home as well as 
 a base for a furniture restoring      
 business at this time. The present    
 owner is an American lady who has     
 extended and modernised the house     
 considerably, but only spends a few   
 months each year living there. It has 
 come full circle as a holiday home for
 a wealthy person.                     </content>
