		<content>  There is only one church of any size 
in our area.That is All Saints' in     
Hesketh Bank.This was founded over four
hundred years ago although not on      
its present site . It sits between the 
rectory and the village hall.The burial
ground is some distance away ,by a     
derelict chapel close to the River     
Douglas boatyard.The Church has a War  
Memorial with the names of sixteen     
local men killed in the two World      
Wars on it.                            
  By looking round the burial ground   
we noticed that one of the most common 
family names in the Hesketh Bank area  
seems to be Iddon.                     
  There are a number of Primitive      
Methodist Chapels in our area. These   
were built in the late 19th century,   
some with bricks from Longton          
Brickcroft.(Sally Nightingale and      
Michael Yeowart)                       </content>
