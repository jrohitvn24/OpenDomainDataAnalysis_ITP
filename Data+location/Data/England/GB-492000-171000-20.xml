		<title>20"ME" BY EMMA LAVELLE</title>
		<content>      My name is Emma Lavelle and I am 
 a very fortunate girl of twelve as my 
 father is a surgeon in London.  We    
 have a comfortable life living in a   
 house called Kingsmead surrounded by  
 beautiful grounds.  I have three      
 brothers who all work very hard.  My  
 eldest brother, Jonathon, is a doctor,
 Edward is at Durham University and    
 Alexander is at school. I am also very
 lucky in having horses and fourteen   
 dogs which we breed, show and love    
 very much.  We lead an exciting life. 
 Every summer and Easter we go for a   
 holiday to North Devon and enjoy      
 playing golf. I love my life in the   
 forest and would not give it up for   
 anything.  My friends who worked at   
 this project with me are Melissa      
 Prior, Caroline Hardy, Donna Holland, 
 Victoria Bowden, Samantha Reid and    
 Nicola Goodwin.                       </content>
