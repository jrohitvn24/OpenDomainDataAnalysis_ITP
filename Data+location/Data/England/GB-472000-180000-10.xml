		<title>10Mayor of Henley Cont.</title>
		<content>There is one more occasion when the    
Mayor wears full robes, it is Mayor    
Making day. It is held in the Mayor's  
parlour. The Mayor swaps robes with    
the new Mayor and then the new Mayor   
is officially Mayor.                   
No one else is allowed to wear the     
chain it is worth 20 thousand pounds.  
One time when the Mayors wife went     
abroad she had to insure it and thats  
how they knew how much the chain is    
worth. The chain was lost for a        
year and when they found it it had a   
chip, the town clerk has not got       
around to sending it to the jewellers  
so it still has the chip.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
