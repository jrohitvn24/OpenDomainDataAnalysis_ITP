		<content>{Hereford}is well known for being the  
 home of the{Special Air Service       
 regiment but not so many people know  
 about the{"Depot",}as it is called, at
{Pontrilas.}The camp was built during  
 the{last war}as a storage depot for   
{munitions}but now it is mainly used as
 a{training area.}A lot of what goes on
 behind the high barbed-wire fence is  
 secret but{explosions}and{gunfire     
 frequently echo across the valley and 
{helicopters}and{parachutists}are often
 seen. The road passes right through   
 the camp and you can see derelict     
 buildings and an airliner fuselage    
 that are used for training. Part of   
 the camp is used as a{radio           
{transmitting}and{receiving}station.   
 The{surrender}message from the        
{Falkland Islands}was received there.
