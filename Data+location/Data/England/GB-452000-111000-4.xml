		<content>      The Curdridge Show is held       
 annually to raise money for the       
 Reading Room.  It is held on the third
 Saturday of July to avoid other shows 
 in the area.  It has a horticultural  
 show, vintage car rally, trade stands,
 sideshows, stalls, a tea tent, and    
 ring events.  These include dancing,  
 fancy dress competitions and a band.  
 Other attractions are a pet show, baby
 show and a craft fayre.               
      Some money is raised beforehand  
 as an insurance against bad weather,  
 by selling draw tickets, sponsorship, 
 trade stands, and selling tickets for 
 the Barn Dance which is held in the   
 marquee on the evening of the Show.   
      Approximately three thousand     
 people attend the Show, and it usually
 makes about Â£3,500 profit.  The       
 expenses are around Â£2,000 including  
 Â£600 for the marquee.                 </content>
