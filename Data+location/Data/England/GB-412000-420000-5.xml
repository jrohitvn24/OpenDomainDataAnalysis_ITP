		<content>  The River Calder flows through       
 this area. The Calder and Hebble      
 Navigation runs alongside it for much 
 of the way, whilst the Brookfoot      
 Marina lies nearby, North West of     
 Brighouse. Leisure activities include 
 boating, mainly on narrow boats,      
 angling for coarse fish on both canal 
 and river, trout fishing on the Marina
 canoeing, water skiing and wind       
 surfing.                              
      Narrow boats are approximately   
 1O metres long and 2 metres wide. Two 
 of them can fit side by side into the 
 locks. Many of the old narrow boats   
 have been carefully restored and      
 brightly decorated with the tradition-
 -al castles and roses. Angling is     
 mainly controlled by a small number of
 local angling clubs, who organise     
 contests during the angling season.
