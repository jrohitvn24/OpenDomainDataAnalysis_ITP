		<title>11Jet planes over the Lune.</title>
		<content>                                       
   The Lune valley is used by the R.A.F
for training and low flying below the  
radar screen. The red and white Hawk   
trainers have young pilots learning    
navigational and flying skills. The    
fast jets usually come very fast with  
no warning,red and yellow lights       
flashing. They startle us and disturb  
our work. When we are outside the noise
is terrific and we imagine they are    
attacking us. Conversation is hard.    
   Sometimes two or three fly together 
but generally they come over in a      
single run down the valley. There are  
times when they do this at night.      
We regularly see Tornadoes,Phantoms    
and Strike masters. The noise          
certainly shatters the quiet in the    
countryside but doesn't seem to disturb
the cows and sheep.                    
   However we don't like it!           </content>
