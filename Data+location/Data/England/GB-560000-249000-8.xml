		<title>08WEST WICKHAM PLAYGROUP</title>
		<content>     A playgroup is held in West       
 Wickham for 3 to 5 year old children. 
 It meets in the mornings for 3 hours  
 and caters for about 20 children,     
 numbers varying with the birthrate. A 
 small fee is payable to help to cover 
 costs and there are two paid helpers. 
 Mothers are asked to help and a       
 committee of parents looks after the  
 finance and organisation. The aim is  
 to encourage children to play together
 and to accept a more disciplined life 
 before they start school at rising    
 five. The children come from homes in 
 West Wickham and also from other small
 villages.
