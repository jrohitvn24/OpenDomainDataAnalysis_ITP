   Shoalstone is an OUTDOOR swimming   
 pool in Brixham. It is next to the    
 Breakwater Beach. It is filled by sea 
 water every high tide.                
   There are three life guards around  
 the pool side. There is a very deep   
 end and a very shallow end, the pool  
 is painted blue inside.               
   The pool is about 33 metres long and
 has lockers at the side. These are 10p
 each. The toilets are 2p each. There  
 is also a shop nearby which sells     
 sweets, coffee, tea, bait, etc.       
   The life guards rent deck chairs to 
 people and the Swimming Club has a    
 small room near the lockers, but      
 they use the indoor pool in           
 Ranscombe Rd. for swimming.           
   In summer the life guards clean     
 the pool out every day but in winter  
 it is left with stones &amp; weed in it. .</content>
