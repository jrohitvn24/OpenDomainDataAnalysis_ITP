		<title>13MY FIRST YEAR AT HATHERSHAW</title>
		<content>  When I first came to Hathershaw,I    
  felt very scared because it seemed so
  big, and all the people were new.    
  The subjects are interesting,but     
  there are some I dont like,metalwork,
  woodwork and science are boring.     
  My personal favourites are french and
  maths.                               
  At christmas we had a party for all  
  the first years,it was brilliant.    
  We had old time dancing like the barn
  dance and others,we also had modern  
  disco dancing.Half way through the   
  party you could hand in your ticket  
  and get a packet of crisps and a     
  drink.                               
  Over a period of months our school   
  helped to raise money for Ethiopia,we
  sent them some blankets and woollen  
  tops,and we have also raised over    
  Â£100 for them.
