 around the area. More mam's work in   
 Durham than anywhere else.The dad's   
 work in more varied places such as    
{Sunderland,Berwick and Newcastle.Some 
 dad's are miners and others drive     
 trucks.Some dad's don't work at all   
 neither do some of the mam's.A few of 
 the parents work in shops as well as  
 programming computers.Not a lot of    
 mam's do cleaning jobs.There is just

 different job to anybody in the       
 class.His mam works in the 'Zebra     
 company'and his dad works at 'Mono    
 Containers'.One person's dad is a     
 teacher at Durham Johnston's.
