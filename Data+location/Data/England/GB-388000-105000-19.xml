 at the topping-out ceremony marking   
 the roofing of the 2nd phase of the   
 Community Hospital.With phase 1 fini- 
 shed last year, the new building will 
 have 30 geriatric,20 psychogeriatric  
 &amp; 22 beds for general hospital        
 care.The original Cottage Hospital    
 built in 1888 was a gift to the town  
 by the Portman family.                
 Also opened this year is the Museum in
 Beres Yard,opposite the Parish Church.
                                       
 Each May we have a horrible fly around
 and this fly bites! It breeds in the  
 River Stour and needs some of your    
 blood! These flies are no bigger than 
 an ordinary mosquito but I hate them. 
 When they bite its like stinging all  
 the time and some people's bites swell
 up like blisters. {Victoria Richards.
