		<title>08POSTLIP MILL - Pt.2</title>
		<content> Paper begins life as a tree, usually a
 fast growing species providing softer 
 longer fibres.                        
 Once pulped the paper resembles solid 
 cottonwool. Most of the wood used     
 comes from N.America and Tunisia.(eg  
 asparto and eucalyptus) The pulping   
 machine breaks the wood down into     
 seperate fibres, this watery mix is   
 then drained on butter muslin which is
 like a fine mesh.                     
 Postlip Mills sell their product      
 worldwide including to Japan, Africa  
 and South America.                    
 The paper is made into rolls about    
 5feet wide that weigh about 1/4 ton.  
 Yearly, P.M. makes 2500 tons of paper 
 (about 10 tons per day) on a five day 
 week. 550feet of paper a minute can be
 made. The workforce of 120 people work
 shifts - 06.00 to 14.00;14.00 to      
 22.00; 22.00 to 06.00.             (5)</content>
