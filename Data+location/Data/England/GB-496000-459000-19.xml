		<content> There are no large shops or businesses
 in the Garton area apart from         
 Burgess's which is dealt with         
 separately.There are three small house
 builders,a joiner,a stress welder and 
 a precision tool maker.               
 There are two general stores  one of  
 which is also the Post Office.There is
 a butcher's shop which opens on       
 request.One unusual retailer is a high
 class ladies fashion boutique based on
 a farm.                               
 A whole variety of mobile shops trade 
 in the area.Although the villagers and
 farmers would like better shopping    
 facilities there is not the population
 to support them.Driffield,which is a  
 busy market town, is only two and a   
 half miles away.
