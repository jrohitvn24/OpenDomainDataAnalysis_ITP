		<content> The jeans used to be baggy on people  
 a few years ago, but now they are     
 tighter. People also wear leg warmers 
 around thier ankles. Some fashion     
 boots have pointed tips. Pixy boots   
 have a pointed end and they have a    
 piece of leather that comes up your   
 legs. The makeup is very nice. Eye    
 shadow comes in different shades of   
 pink, blue, silver, gold, green and   
 lots of other colours. There are some 
 good lipsticks as well. They are      
 mainly reds and pinks. You can also   
 buy blusher, glitter to put in your   
 hair and face, eye liner, foundation  
 cream, and many others.
