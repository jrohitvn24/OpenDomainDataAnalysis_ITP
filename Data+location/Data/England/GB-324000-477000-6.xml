		<title>06Education in Pennington</title>
		<content> Pennington School is different from   
 other schools because it is'nt built  
 in a village. It is built in a field  
 between the villages of Swarthmoor and
 Loppergarth. This is how it got there:
 In 1870 the government said that every
 village had to make a school.Neither  
 the people in Swarthmoor nor those in 
 Loppergarth had enough money for a    
 school so they put their money        
 together and asked the government in  
 London if they could build one school 
 between the two villages.The          
 government said yes.The Duke          
 ofBuccleugh gave the poor a field,the 
 farmers brought the stones and the    
 people built the school.The school    
 opened on 25th March1876.It now has an
 old part and a new Infant block,built 
 in 1972.There are 6 teachers,2        
 caretakers,a secretary and 5          
 dinner-ladies.                        </content>
