		<title>20Local Footpaths</title>
		<content> but when we lived in Enfield it was   
 not a very good place for walking.    
      When we moved to Ugley we were   
 really surprised to see so many       
 fields.  We moved in on August 9th so 
 the fields had just been ploughed,    
 when we talked to our neighbours, we  
 asked about the footpaths and they    
 said there was meant to be one going  
 across our field but the farmer would 
 not leave it so we didn't know where  
 it was exactly. The Council said they 
 would give my dad a map of the        
 footpaths but we never heard anything 
 from them. My dad said "I'm going to  
 walk across the footpath with my dogs 
 and if Mr Recay decides to shoot them 
 or fine me that's when something's    
 going to be done about it".           
      Footpaths are a right of way and 
 unless they are used we could all lose
 access to the countryside".           </content>
