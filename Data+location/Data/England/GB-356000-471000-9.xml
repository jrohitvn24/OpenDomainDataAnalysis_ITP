   Melling and Arkholme are on the bus 
route from Lancaster to Kirkby Lonsdale
although it is only a limited service. 
Special buses take older children to   
secondary schools and bring Primary    
children from other villages and farms.
Some men go to work on buses hired by  
their firm. Most people have cars.     
   There are no shops in Melling so a  
lady from the garage takes some elderly
people, mainly ladies,to shop and to   
collect pensions. A new Voluntary      
Transport Service for emergencies has  
been organised by the WI.and P.Council.
   The railway skirts both villages    
but the stations were closed about 20  
years ago and converted to private     
houses. The line goes through to       
Yorkshire. Melling school children     
watched the steam train,"Flying Scots- 
man"go through on its last journey.    </content>
