		<content> I get up at 7 o'clock and I have      
 Weetabix for breakfast.Then I brush   
 my teeth and get dressed.I get into   
 the car and go to school.I take off   
 my coat and go to class.We do some    
 work and go to Assembly,where I sing. 
 We go out to play and after the       
 whistle we have milk and a biscuit    
 and do some more work.When we have our
 lunch we can choose what we want to   
 eat in the dining room.After lunch    
 we play in the playground.We do alot  
 of work in the afternoon and then we  
 go home at 3.15.                      
 At home I like to read a book,go out  
 to play or watch television.I have    
 tea ,then watch television before I   
 have a bath and go to bed.
