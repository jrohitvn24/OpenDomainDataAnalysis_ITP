		<title>03FISHING AT LA ROCQUE</title>
		<content>      Steven Robinson's grandad has    
 been a fisherman all his life.  He has
 seen many changes around La Rocque.   
 Fishermen don't now go off for a whole
 week to the Minquiers.  Lobster pots  
 are now made out of metal whereas they
 used to be made out of green willow.  
 In 1940 fishermen used cotton nets but
 now nets are made from monofil, a     
 man-made fibre.  Boats were made from 
 wood, now they're more usually made   
 from fibreglass and are equipped with 
 motors instead of oars.  In pre-war   
 days if a fisherman saw another's nets
 he would move somewhere else.         
 Nowadays, they put their nets down    
 right next to someone else's.  In     
 those days, you could leave your nets 
 on the slipway for a week to dry out. 
 Today, you would find they had  been  
 taken.
