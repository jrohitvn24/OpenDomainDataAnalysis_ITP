		<title>03A Mill on the Stour</title>
		<content> The first working mill on the river   
 Stour is Purns Mill.Many mills have   
 been closed down and one of these is  
 Ecclife Mill.Here, a system of hatces 
 controlled the water levels for water 
 wheel drive.The mill was modernised   
 with turbines in 1904 and continued   
 working until the very cold winter of 
 the early 1940's.The river froze and  
 thick snow lay on the ice.The snow    
 melted flooded the mill and large     
 peices of flooting ice wrecked the    
 hatches.The machinery was removed and 
 the mill was sold to a local farmer   
 as a store and stable.The mill is now 
 an unusual house with water on three  
 sides of its garden.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
