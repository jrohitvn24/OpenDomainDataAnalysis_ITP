		<title>10Peoples Views on our Town</title>
		<content> On our survey we visited 119 houses,  
 and found that,although not many      
 people had been born here,most people 
 had lived in the town for over 20     
 years.All of the towns from where they
 had come were in the north of England.
 Most people had moved to our town to  
 get a job,and were happy with our     
 houses and gardens,and liked this area
 of the town.Nearly everyone liked the 
 trees and open spaces and used the    
 leisure facilities,especially the     
 recreation centre,the sports complex  
 and the library.Everyone went shopping
 in the town centre,but thought that   
 more shops and more seats would       
 improve the place.Three people would  
 like to scrap the Development         
 Corporation,and one man said we should
 shoot all of the councillors!
