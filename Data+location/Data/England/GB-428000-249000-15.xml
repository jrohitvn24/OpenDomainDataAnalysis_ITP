		<title>15HOPES AND FEARS - 2.</title>
		<content> b)That the village school remains     
 open.In Butlers Marston school there  
 are less than 40 pupils.Villagers     
 hoped that young children would not   
 have to be "bussed out"to school.     
 c)The older people hoped that there   
 would be more local bus services for  
 O.A.P.s and that the church would     
 retain its hold on the affairs and    
 lives of local inhabitants.Younger    
 people hoped for better leisure       
 facilities.In particular they wanted a
 public house for Butlers Marston.     
{What are your fears for this area?}   
 a)That young people will be squeezed  
 out of the village because of poor    
 employment prospects and expensive    
 housing.                              
 b)That motorway development will spoil
 the rural area.                       
 c)That the surrounding agricultural   
 land will be overdeveloped.           </content>
