		<content>   {G.W. Thornton's}make steel not     
 chocolates. They have machines that   
 make paint scrapers, gouging tools    
 for fashioning wood, ball joints for  
 hip replacements, cutting blades for  
 coal machines and blades for turbines 
 which drive jet aircraft.             
   In the factory it is very hot and   
 noisy. You have to wear goggles. We   
 saw a factory cat. It was very dirty  
 and laid asleep on a machine through  
 all the noise. The noise is so loud   
 that you have to shout &amp; then it      
 sounds like a whisper.                
   They have to magnify the products to
 see if anything is wrong with them.   
 They have to be bang on the right size
 &amp; shape. If they arent perfect for the
 aeroplanes it can be very dangerous.  
   There are 145 people employed. They 
 try to employ families because they   
 get on well.                          </content>
