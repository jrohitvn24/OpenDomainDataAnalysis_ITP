The area covered is the northern tip of
ISLIP and the whole of LOWICK. The area
is predominantly farmland with a large 
expanse of water, the result of sand   
and gravel extraction. There are also  
wooded areas containing mainly         
deciduous trees.                       
                                       
The recent completion of a bypass      
linking the A 509 with the New Town of 
CORBY has removed virtually all        
through traffic from these two         
villages.                              
                                       
There are few amenities available      
within the area but it is well served  
by a number of nearby towns, where     
most of the population finds its       
employment.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
