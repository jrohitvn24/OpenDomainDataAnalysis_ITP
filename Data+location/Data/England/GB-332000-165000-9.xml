 The Avon Wildlife Trust was formed in 
 1980 in Bristol and is a voluntary    
 organisation with three full-time     
 workers.  It is their aim to preserve 
 and develop areas that will provide   
 protection for the plants and animals 
 that grow and live in Avon.           
 One such area is south of St.Thomas's 
 Head skirting the estuary of the River
 Banwell.  This small reserve provides 
 a haven for migrating birds and others
 such as the Gold Crest, Fire Crest,   
 Kestrel and on one rare occasion a    
 Merlin was sighted.  There is a badger
 set on the reserve and many rabbits . 
 The natural plant life benefits from  
 the closed nature of the reserve and  
 amongst many species are two types of 
 orchid and a rare Somerset grass.
