		<content> TOURISM -  THERE ARE MANY INTERESTING 
 THINGS TO BE SEEN IN THIS AREA RANGING
 FROM THE REMAINS OF AN OLD RAILWAY    
 LINE, A WATER TREATMENT WORKS, THE OLD
 TOLLGATE COTTAGE, THE DRAW-OFF POINT  
 FOR WATER FROM THE RIVER NENE, SEVERAL
 CIRCULAR SPINNEYS - CHARACTERISTIC OF 
 THE AREA -, TO AN OLD STONE MONUMENT  
 ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PITSFORD VILLAGE. 
 IT IS POSSIBLE TO VISIT AND TOUR THE  
 WATER TREATMENT WORKS BY ARRANGEMENT  
 WITH THE "ANGLIA WATER AUTHORITY".    
 THE LEVEL OF WATER IN THE RESERVOIR IS
 REPLENISHED WHEN NECESSARY BY DRAWING 
 FROM THE RIVER AT "MERRY TOM" AND     
 PUMPING TO PITSFORD.                  
 THE CIRCULAR SPINNEYS MAY BE SEEN AS  
 FREQUENT FEATURES ON EARL SPENCER'S   
 LAND. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR MAIN    
 FUNCTION IS TO PROVIDE SHELTERED      
 REARING CONDITIONS FOR PHEASANTS WHICH
 LOCAL GENTRY MAY THEN SHOOT IN SEASON.</content>
