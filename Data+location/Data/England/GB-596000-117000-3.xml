		<title>03ECOLOGY--  SAND DUNES</title>
		<content> This is a seaside area. At the west   
 end of the area the sand dunes rise to
 about 20 metres high. Marram grass    
 has been planted to stabilise the     
 sand.  Sea buckthorn too is spreading 
 especially on the landward side.  At  
 first sight there seems little else in
 the way of plants, but on searching we
 found puff balls and other fungi,     
 ragwort,  sea rocket, willow herb,    
 evening primrose,common storksbill    
 ,ladies bedstraw, plantain,thistles   
 and dandelion. Bushes included        
 tamarisk,hawthorn, blackthorn and     
 elder.  Two blockhouses, a legacy of  
 the last war, had deadly nightshade   
 and bindweed around them.  The dunes  
 are home to large numbers of rabbits, 
 foxes roam over them, and in the      
 spring cuckoos arrive and thrive on   
 the larvae of the brown tailed moth.
