		<title>15HOW LYMM HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content> We put some questions to an old lady  
 who has been living in the Lymm area  
 for 25 years. The questions were to   
 find out how Lymm has changed during  
 the past 25 years.                    
 We asked her if the motorway had      
 helped traffic to ease off in Lymm.   
 She said it had at first but it is    
 beginning to get worse.  Although it  
 is getting worse she said it could be 
 even worse if it wasn't for the       
 motorway.                             
 We asked her if she had noticed any   
 changes since she came to Lymm.  She  
 said that it had grown in size and    
 population.  All the land around      
 Highfield had been grass for many     
 years.  Before the top of Highfield   
 Road was built it was grass fields.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
