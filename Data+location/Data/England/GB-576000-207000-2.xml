		<title>02LITTLE BADDOW COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>   The village community is comprised  
 of several elements, farmers and their
 families who have worked on the land  
 in the area for many generations, the 
 newer residents, many of whom commute 
 to Chelmsford, Romford, and London,   
 and those who have been born and bred 
 in the village. The main focal points 
 of the village are the  Post Office/  
 general store, the butchers, two      
 public houses and a Memorial Hall     
 which acts as a meeting place for     
 local societies. The Chelmer/         
 Blackwater Navigation canal runs west 
 to east 1km north of the village and  
 is a navigable section of the River   
 Chelmer providing the opportunity for 
 transportation and tourism.           
   Little Baddow is a typical farming  
 community which is changing due to the
 increasing influence of local towns.
