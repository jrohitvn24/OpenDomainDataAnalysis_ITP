		<title>03LOSSIEMOUTH HARBOUR.</title>
		<content> Lossiemouth harbour is situated to the
 east of the area and construction was 
 begun in 1837.At the beginning of the 
 century there were 160 fishing boats  
 in the Lossiemouth fleet.Now in 1985  
 there are only 15 boats fishing       
 regularly from the port because most  
 of these have moved to better fishing-
 grounds on the east and west coasts   
      The local boats land some white  
 fish.These are sold at the fish-market
 which is held between 8a.m.and 10a.m. 
 daily.The prawns are bought locally by
 the Fish-Processing Plant.Fifty stone 
 of prawns are purchased daily for the 
 Plant.The white fish is bought by     
 local fish merchants for sale over the
 counter.The fishing boats land        
 approximately 250 boxes in total      
 between them.
