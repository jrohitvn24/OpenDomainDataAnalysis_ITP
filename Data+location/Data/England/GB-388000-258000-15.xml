		<title>15ODDINGLEY:CHANGES IN TIME.</title>
		<content> Life in this area has not changed a   
 great deal in its landscape.The most  
 notable change has been in the use of 
 the canal.It was once used frequently 
 to transport heavy loads and goods    
 from Worcester to Birmingham.Canal    
 transport was a major distributor in  
 industry, but now the canals main     
 cargo consists of leisure boats.There 
 are a few companies that hire out     
 barges for the use of holiday makers. 
 The surrounding land of{Oddingley}is  
 made up of grazing land and fields of 
 crops.One field is known localy as    
{'The Pigeon House'}as in the past the 
 pigeons gathered here.Another field   
 has been named{'The Brick Yard'       
 because the fields previous use was   
 supposedly to take bricks to          
 build local houses.Some fields are now
 used for the production of turf to be 
 sold for use in the garden.           </content>
