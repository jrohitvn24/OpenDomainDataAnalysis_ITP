		<title>01BEMPTON AND BUCKTON</title>
		<content>      Bempton and Buckton are situated 
 on the {Flamborough}headland. With    
 the exception of the residential      
 sectors, the landscape is almost      
 entirely given over to agriculture.   
      As a selected settlement in the {
{Humberside}County Council Structure   
 Plan, Bempton is expanding whereas    
 Buckton is a non-selected village     
 therefore no major development can    
 take place.                           
      The two villages are administered
 by one Parish Council based at        
 Bempton. The villages, which are      
 separated by only one field, are      
 situated in a valley with the land to 
 the north rising to form spectacular {
  chalk {cliffs}and the land to the    
 south rising before dropping down     
 towards {Bridlington.}
