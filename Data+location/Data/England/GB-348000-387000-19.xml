 people we questioned appears to be    
 very good. The majority were in full  
 time employment, financially able to  
 support a good life style.            
{Entertainment}We asked 57 people how  
 often they visited restraunts and     
 pubs, 23 said fairly regularly, 27    
 said occasionally. Some travel to     
 Liverpool or Manchester to visit the  
 theatre.                              
{Holidays} Of 69 households questioned 
 45 take holidays away from home for an
 average of 2 weeks. Most of these     
 travelling abroad. Of the 69          
 questioned, 11 owned caravans.        
{Cars}In the 69 households, 83 cars    
 were owned.
