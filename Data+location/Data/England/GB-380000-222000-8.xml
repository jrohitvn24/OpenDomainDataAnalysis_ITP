		<title>08SANDHURST VILLAGE SERVICES</title>
		<content>THE PROBLEM OF A RURAL COMMUNITY       
 Sandhurst has very few services as it 
is too small to support any but the    
most basic functions.                  
 There is one small sub-post office cum
store (see page 5) but it is hardly    
economically viable although it serves 
an important need for the elderly. The 
village pub, The White Horse Inn, has  
closed. Falling numbers mean that the  
Primary School will soon close, the    
Youth Club has already gone.           
 Sandhurst is on mains drainage but has
no street lights. There is only one bus
per week, to Gloucester on a Friday.   
One of the villagers, Mrs Goode, deliv-
ers the local Â£Citizen' newspaper every
evening and acts as a messenger between
the elderly in particular.             
 At Woolridge The Rising Sun is a busy 
public house with a skittle alley and  
is a focal point for the local people. </content>
