		<title>01BRILL-GENERAL INFORMATION.</title>
		<content>Brill is 5 miles from Thame and 9 miles
west of Aylesbury.The village is       
situated on a high hill about 90 to    
100 metres above other surrounding     
villages and countryside.Four roads    
meet in the centre of the village.The  
north west side of the village is      
covered by an extensive common         
covering a large area.Some small woods 
are dotted around the outskirts of     
Brill.They were part of the ancient    
Bernewode Forest which covered this    
part of Buckinghamshire.Brill          
manufactured tiles,pottery and         
especially bricks from the 13th.c.to   
the 19th.c..The common is dented by    
pits and bumps which were once busy    
with men working and digging for clay. 
A 17th.c.post mill stands here.        
Although Brill thrived for centuries   
on local industry it remains unspoilt  
and self contained.                    </content>
