		<content> The area in the survey has no famous  
 public figures who have any           
 aristocratic background.Neither of the
 villages in the survey had any        
 manorhouse of known importance.However
 we are fortunate to have in our       
 community two important local         
 politicians Mr E.White,our county     
 coucillor,and Mr W. Law Croft's parish
 council chairman and district         
 councillor for Blaby district.We were 
 fortunate to have an interview with Mr
 Law.He told us of his day at work.He  
 is an official in charge of purchasing
 equipment for the British Gas         
 Corporation.In fact he is in charge of
 a budget of 25 million pounds.His     
 headquarters are at Hinckley .This was
 chosen by British Gas because it is   
 near the centre of England.Mr Law told
 that he enjoyed his work since it made
 him think.He also enjoys gardening.   </content>
