		<content> Of all the people interviewed and     
 asked questions about their jobs we   
 found that about two thirds of the men
 worked out of the village,but the     
 picture was very different as far as  
 women were concerned as about twice as
 many women worked in the village as   
 out of it. Nearly two thirds of all   
 the familys interviewd had two wage   
 earners in them,although about half of
 the womens jobs were part time or     
 seasonal work. Although a great number
 of the engineering jobs were out of   
 the village most of the other jobs    
 were to be found in it e.g.farmers,   
 butchers, shopkeepers, teachers, brick
 workers,milkmen,carpenters,electrician
 s,postladies and policemen.           
 Unemployment in the sample taken was  
 at about 7%.
