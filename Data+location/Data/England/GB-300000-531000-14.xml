		<title>14Employment _local survey</title>
		<content> We did a survey in one of the classes 
 in our school.The survey was to see   
 how many mums had a job and how many  
 Dads had a job.I surveyed twenty three
 people and 17% of the dads have no    
 jobs and 53% of the mums haven't jobs.
 I asked the people how many dads      
 worked at Flimby and how many mums    
 worked at Flimby 10% of dads worked at
 Flimby and 33% of mums worked at      
 Flimby.I asked how many Dads worked   
 away from Flimby and I got 90% and I  
 got 67% from the mums.The most popular
 job for the Dads is Thames Board mills
 the wood and paper factory.The popular
 job for the mams is working at        
 Greggains in a shop stacking shelves.
