		<title>09Uncle Harry Remembers.</title>
		<content> I interviewed my{Uncle Harry}and{     
{Auntie Ev.}about life in the 1940's.  
 The money then was pounds,shillings   
 and pence.A bicycle, for example, was 
 Â£4-10s-0d. Uncle Harry started work at
 14 years old, he was paid 2s 2d a day 
 for working down the pit. The houses  
 built down our street were built by   
 the{NCB,}and were built in{1917.}Only 
 miners from{Dearne Valley}could live  
 in them.Cars in those days used to    
 cost Â£60-0s-0d and petrol 2d or 3d.   
 Uncle Harry said that bananas were    
 seven for a tanner,and he would take  
 bread and dripping for his dinner down
 the pit. He used to work at{Dearne    
{Valley Pit,}which is very close to    
 Great Houghton.Sally's shop used to be
 owned by Liza Pearson.When my Uncle   
 and Aunty first went to live in their 
 house their rent was 6 bob a week.
