 Employment in the area is restricted  
 to farming and small cottage          
 industries, thus the majority of the  
 population is employed outside the    
 area, mainly in Leicester and Rugby   
 conurbations.  Occupations range      
 through textiles, engineering,        
 hosiery, shopkeepers and assistants to
 a number of the professions such as   
 medicine, engineering and computing.  
                                       
 Unemployment is not a severe problem  
 there being only about 6 in this      
 category in Ashby Magna.              
                                       
 Lack of transport presents a problem  
 and all persons in employment have to 
 use private transport to get to and   
 from their workplace.
