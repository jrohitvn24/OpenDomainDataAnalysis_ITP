		<title>08WORCESTER SWIMMING POOL</title>
		<content> Worcester Swimming Pool was opened in 
 1970.Before that Worcester only had an
 outdoor pool.When we go to the pool   
 now,we can see a slope down into a pit
 with flowers in it.That is where the  
 old pool used to be-we think it is    
 very small.The diving pit was not     
 separate,and you could stand on the   
 bottom in the deep end.It was only    
 open from May to September because    
 people didn't want to swim in the     
 winter.People called the old pool     
 "Parkes'Puddle".The new pool is       
 deeper,longer,and the diving area is  
 separated. You are not allowed to swim
 in the diving area.There is a special 
 little pool for learners and          
 babies which is 7 metres by 12 metres.
      Before even the old pool was     
 built,children used to have swimming  
 lessons from an old barge on the      
 river.This was in the 1920's.         </content>
