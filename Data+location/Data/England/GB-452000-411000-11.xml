		<title>11Falkland's War</title>
		<content> My brother was a corpral in the Royal 
 Marines when he went,but now he is a  
 sargeant.We never had a warning when  
 he went.He sailed on H.M.S. Hermes.He 
 stopped at the Ascension Islands and  
 carried on to the Falklands.We were   
 all on 'hot pins' at home.We watched  
 every news broadcast and read every   
 newspaper.We got all the news from    
 Carol,my brother's wife.I made a scrap
 book.A long time later when it was all
 over we had a massive Union Jack on   
 the side of the house.It covered the  
 wall.We had flags and banners up and  
 my brother brought me back an         
 Argentinian hat,scabbard and bayonet. 
 They were ex-American                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
