		<title>13TRENGWAINTON GARDENS.</title>
		<content>  Trengwainton Gardens is a National   
 Trust property in the village of      
 Heamoor.It is famous for its rhodo-   
 dendron bushes and trees and azalea   
 bushes;especially beautiful at Spring-
 time when they are in bloom.There is a
 long drive which leads up to the house
 about half a mile long with wooded    
 walks on either side.                 
  Running through the grounds is a     
 small stream,which also flows past the
 old infants' school in Heamoor.       
  Some of the many different plants can
 only grow in the South West of England
 because of the mild damp climate.There
 is a Mexican bush,planted by Princess 
 Anne when she visited Cornwall.       
  The house is occupied by Major S.    
 Bolitho.Local groups and societies    
 have fetes and bands hold concerts    
 there at week-ends.The gardens are    
 officially open from Easter until Oct.</content>
