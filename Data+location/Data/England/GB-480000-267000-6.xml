		<content>The local children spend their free    
time in a variety of ways: horse riding
and swimming are popular and one person
helps the local farmer, whilst another 
goes flying. Thimble and stamp         
collecting, train spotting, fishing and
judo are all popular. Most children    
belong to the Scouting Movement. The   
Beavers are boys aged between 6 and 8. 
They play games and make things. The   
cubs are aged 8-11. They salute the    
Union Jack during their meetings. They 
work hard for badges. They go camping. 
The scouts meet at Mears Ashby. They   
are aged between 11 and 15. They       
learn about knots, camping, firemaking,
tracking and orienteering. The Brownies
meet in Overstone WI Hall on a Friday  
evening. They are aged between 6 and   
10. The guides meet at Sywell School.  
There is no youth club. A lot of       
children learn musical instruments.    </content>
