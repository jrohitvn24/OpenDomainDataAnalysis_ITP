		<content> Farming is an important occupation in 
this area, despite being so close to a 
major town.                            
 Farms on the whole are arable, few    
livestock being kept. Two of the local 
farms provide a dairy service, milk and
cream delivered to local homes. The    
milk is not processed on the farms but 
is sent away. One of the largest farms 
in the area grows cereal crops and oil 
seed rape. The farmer supplies horse   
and pony food for the many local       
stables and horse owners. Most of the  
soil on the farms is grade 2           
agricultural land.                     
 Horticulture and market gardening are 
also important in the area. Pick your  
own fruit and vegetables are a regular 
feature in summer months, especially   
strawberries. A large nursery/garden   
centre has been set up in Hawley       
which is expanding all the time.       </content>
