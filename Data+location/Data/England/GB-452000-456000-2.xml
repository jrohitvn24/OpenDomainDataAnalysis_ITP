		<content> This area is mainly agricultural,most 
 of the farms are arable.Fifty years   
 ago there would have been more dairy  
 than arable.Intensive animal farming  
 has left more land for crops.Machinery
 has changed farming.Fifty years ago   
 there would have been one tractor for 
 the whole village. Now there are 5-10 
 tractors on each farm.Autumn is now   
 the busiest time of the year because  
 farmers harvest and sow at the same   
 time.{Manor farm}is a dairy and arable
 farm it has 125 ha, we grow wheat,    
 barley,grass,sugar beet.Some parts of 
 the land are heavy and some parts of  
 the land are light.We get 50 tonnies a

 hectare of wheat and 7 tonnies a      
 hectare of barley.We have 20, 2 year  
 old heifers. We have 40 calves and 50
