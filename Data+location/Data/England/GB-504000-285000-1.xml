My name is Verity. I live in Polebrook 
and I go to Polebrook C.E. Primary     
School. On Monday nights Brownies are  
held in the school hall. In the school 
there are seventy two children and four
teachers. On a Friday we go swimming in
the Oundle Pool. After school on Friday
there is a chess club. Polebrook has a 
pub and a youth club. I live in an old 
cottage next door to Polebrook church. 
It is very pretty. Mr. Mace is the     
rector. We have a bus stop, but there  
is a bus only once a week. The milkman,
postman and paper boys come every day  
and at school we have a library van    
that comes once a week.
