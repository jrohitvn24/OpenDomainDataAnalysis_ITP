		<content> Point was originally erected in 1825  
 in memory of Sir John Doyle KCB KC who
 was Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey   
 from 1803 to 1815. It was destroyed by
 the Germans in 1944 and replaced by   
 the States in 1953. There is also a   
 smaller monument showing the Channel  
 Islands next to it which was erected  
 in 1952 to commemorate the Coronation 
 of Queen Elizabeth II. The original   
 was lost during the Occupation. The   
 Baptist Church was built in 1827, the 
 Methodist later in the century and St 
 Martin de la Bellouse (Belloose) or   
 Beilleuse in 1048. The bell tower of  
 St Martins is slightly east of the    
 centre with a clock facing south.     
 Access to the bells is up a spiral    
 staircase inside. The font inside the 
 south door is the only one which dates
 from pre-Reformation times in the     
 island and the pulpit is dated 1657.  </content>
