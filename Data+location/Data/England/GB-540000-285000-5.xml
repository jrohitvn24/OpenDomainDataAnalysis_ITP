		<title>05Chatteris - Horseway Travel</title>
		<content> To get to school the children had to  
 walk across muddy fields to Horseway  
 Bridge, where a horse and cart        
 collected them and took them up New   
 Road into Chatteris.                  
                                       
 Barges travelled along the Forty      
 Foot,Vermuden's Drain, carrying       
 fruit,crops and peat to the docks in  
 Chatteris.  A floating Church went    
 from Holme Fen along the drain to     
 Manea and the lady told us that three 
 of her relations were christened on it
 at Holme.                             
                                       
 Where New Road joins Langwood Hill    
 Drove was a pub called "The           
 Anchor."Going towards Chatteris near  
 the old cottages was "The Farmer's    
 Boy" and opposite Delve Farm was "The 
 Bird in Hand".  People could buy      
 milk,butter and cheese from the farm. </content>
