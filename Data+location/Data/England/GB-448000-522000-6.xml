		<title>06QUEEN'S HEAD HOTEL</title>
		<content> Tucked away behind the{Queen's Head   
{Hotel}among the dereliction that was  
 once{Haverton Hill}is a little oasis  
 of colour and peace.A lovely garden of
 green grass and colourful borders of  
 roses and bedding plants.             
 The landlord was pictured in the local
 newspaper this summer trying to sow   
 the seeds of pride back into this     
 area. In the last four and a half     
 years he has seen the area go down    
 hill."There's a lot of nice people    
 here and nearly everyone has a garden 
 but a few think anything goes,"he     
 said.He is offering prizes to the     
 winners of his"best kept garden"      
 contest in the hope that lazy diggers 
 will"pull their socks up!"A judge     
 from{Stockton Council's}Parks Dept.   
 will be invited to pick the winners.
