		<title>18Transport And Parking</title>
		<content> The main types of transport are bus   
 and private car. The town does not    
 have a railway station,this closed in 
 1970.  Louth Bus Station is on Queen  
 Street. From here you can catch a     
 service bus to Grimsby, Mablethorpe,  
 Skegness and Lincoln. The nearest     
 large shopping centre is at Grimsby 15
 miles away. Buses leave hourly for    
 Grimsby and it cost's Â£2.20 Adult     
 return and Â£1.30 Child return. Regular
 excursions to cities like London and  
 to seaside resorts also leave from    
 from the bus station but these are    
 operated by private companies such as 
 Appleby's. Many people use private    
 cars so parking is hard.There are 9   
 carparks making about 700 spaces.The  
 largest is in Northgate.It cost's 10p 
 per 2 hours.Half the  people in Louth 
 thought parking in Louth was good.
