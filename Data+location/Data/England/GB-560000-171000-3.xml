		<title>03Southfleet Church</title>
		<content> The Church of St Nicholas,Southfleet  
 was built in the fourteenth century.  
 Some of the stone used in the building
 came from an earlier Church and from  
 the Roman buildings at Springhead.The 
 south door is made of oak and dates   
 from the fourteenth century.There is a
 fifteenth century font with           
 interesting carvings on the side.There
 are five brasses in the church.The    
 unusual thing about them is that 2 of 
 them  are of the same lady,Joan Urban.
 One was made in 1414 when she died and
 another was made of her and her       
 husband when he died in 1420.There is 
 a Roll of Honour in the church to     
 commemorate the people of Southfleet  
 who gave their lives in the two World 
 Wars.One page is turned over each week
 and on Remembrance Sunday all the     
 names are read out before the 2       
 minutes silence.                      </content>
