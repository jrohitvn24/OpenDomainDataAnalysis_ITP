		<title>04PEOPLE'S LIVES</title>
		<content> The people who live in this area are  
 generally{very content.  }In the      
 village people move in and out quite  
 regularly, but most have{lived here   
{for some years.  }Out of the village, 
 most people have been here for most or
 all of their lives.   They all{like   
{living here,}because of the           
{countryside}and because they like the 
{life in a village.  }King's Caple has 
 got bigger, but outside it people say 
 that there has been{no real change,   
 and they{don't want any changes made. 
 Some go into{Hereford}quite regularly,
 but there are a lot who only go once a
 month or even less.   The{bus service 
 is not at all good, so they travel by 
{car.   Television}is the only         
 entertainment available to them unless
 they go into town, and they spend most
 of their spare time at home.   They   
 are{very relaxed, happy people.       </content>
