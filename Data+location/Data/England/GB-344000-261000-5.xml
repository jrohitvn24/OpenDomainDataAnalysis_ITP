		<content>   A lady resident was born in the old 
 School House (now part of Kingsland   
 School) on 7.7.1897.  Her father was  
 the Headmaster at the school from 1894
 until 1931.  The family moved into the
 new school house (now called "Outer   
 Bailey") in 1914.  She taught at the  
 school until she married a local      
 farmer's son in 1926. She and her     
 husband lived locally in the same     
 house for 35 years until they moved to
 Lincoln House.  Although now 88, she  
 still takes an active part in the farm
 which her son now farms.  She drove a 
 car until mid-June, 1985.             
   Activities of residents include     
 gardening, fishing, shooting,         
 beagling, cricket, football, rounders,
 tennis, golf, hockey, swimming, pigeon
 racing, BMX cycling, running, bridge, 
 pop music, riding, hunting, horse     
 racing, road rallying and ballet.     </content>
