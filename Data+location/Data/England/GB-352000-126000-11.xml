 In ladders you have to get in a line  
 with a partner.Somebody numbers you   
 and if your number is called out you  
 have to jump up,run down the middle,  
 run up the side,jump over the rest of 
 the legs and get back to your place   
 before your partner gets back.        
  One game which has always been played
 at our school is DUMP.All the players 
 sit in a circle,facing into the       
 middle.One player walks round the     
 outside of the circle.He or she has to
 drop a handkerchief behind one of the 
 people sitting.That person then has to
 chase the first one ,trying to catch  
 him before he sits down in the empty  
 place.If the first person manages to  
 reach the plce first,then the second  
 person is 'On'and it is his turn to   
 walk round.
