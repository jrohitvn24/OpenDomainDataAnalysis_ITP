		<title>04Transport in Braydon</title>
		<content> The main mode of transport is by car  
 in this area. The roads, although     
 narrow are well maintained.           
    A public transport system would not
 be economical because of the sparse   
 population in the area. There are bus 
 services to transport school children 
 and college students. Age Concern- a  
 group with a special interest in the  
 elderly - arranges a monthly          
 concessionary bus service. This is    
 funded by the Parish Council.         
    There is some concern at the heavy 
 lorry transport on the Ashton Keynes  
 to Wootton Bassett road, passing      
 through Braydon. The lorries transport
 gravel from Ashton Keynes to the new  
 expansion area of West Swindon and    
 Woodshaw.                             
    For those who prefer to cycle there
 is a cycleway passing Drill Farm, The 
 Firs and Park View Farm.              </content>
