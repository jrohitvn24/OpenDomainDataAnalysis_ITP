		<title>01Description of Area</title>
		<content> Situated about 10 miles south of      
 Bristol in Green Belt land, elevation 
 between 250 and 500ft, the area is    
 chiefly agricultural consisting of 20 
 or more small farms (mainly dairy,    
 some beef and sheep), an area of      
 unfenced land known as Breach Hill,   
 and many miles of narrow lanes. Almost
 the whole parish and the entire       
 village of Nempnett Thrubwell is      
 included as well as half the parish of
 Winford to the north and small areas  
 of Ubley and Compton Martin to the    
 south. There is a corner of Blagdon   
 Lake (Yeo Reservoir) to the S.W. and a
 similar area of Chew Valley Lake to   
 the S.E, both being surronded by      
 plantations of conifers and other     
 trees. The whole area is criss-crossed
 by a maze of footpaths, not           
 necessarily rights of way.
