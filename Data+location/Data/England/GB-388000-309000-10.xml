 Most of the people in this area belong
 to the Church of England.The others   
 were Catholic and attend church       
 weekly.The people who belonged to the 
 Church of England attended church     
 monthly or on Saints' days (e.g       
 Christmas).A few of the people were   
 not members of any religious groups   
 and only attend church once or twice  
 a year. The churches attended were:St.
 Mary's Catholic church in Brewood or  
 St. Chad's which is also in Brewood.  
 Other churches were either in Shifnal 
 or in Stafford. One typical man was   
 not religious but in his past was a   
 bellringer and went to church weekly. 
 He now does not go to church but      
 considers himself a true Christian.   
 Most people did not attend church     
 often but thought of themselves as    
 true Christians like this man.        </content>
