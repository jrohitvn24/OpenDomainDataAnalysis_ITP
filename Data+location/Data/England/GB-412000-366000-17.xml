		<title>17FLAGG  (NEAR MONYASH)</title>
		<content>  {Flagg}is a friendly farming village.
 It is about{2.75km north-west of      
{Monyash.}It is a village that has     
 been the same since it was first      
 built.It is a typical example of a    
{linear village}and all but two of the 
 houses are on one sid of the road.    
 There are about 63 houses in Flagg,   
 and 151 people live there.            
   We have fields and lanes we         
 have to pay the Parish Council for.   
 We have a 50 year old{village hall,}a 
{church,}a{chapel}(built in 1883) and a
{nursery school.}There is a{pub "The   
{Plough Inn"}and there is one shop     
 which is a{post office and general    
{store.   }                            
   The men used to work down the lead- 
 mines but now most of them are        
{farmers.}The church is very old and in
 the graveyard there is only one grave 
 _belonging to an ex-vicar.            </content>
