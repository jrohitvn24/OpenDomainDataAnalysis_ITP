		<title>10Horningsham Luncheon Club</title>
		<content> The Luncheon Club meets in the Village
 Hall every Thursday. Most of the      
 members are either old age pensioners 
 or disabled. Some people are unable to
 get to the hall and their meals are   
 taken to them. Some of the members are
 brought in by cars from as            
 far away as Warminster and            
 Maiden Bradley.                       
 Altogether there are twenty-four      
 voluntary helpers although usually    
 only twelve help at any one time.     
 The charge for a meal is 65p          
 The Club also holds a Christmas party 
 when sherry is served in addition to  
 the traditional roast turkey.         
 In addition to the money paid by      
 members for their meal, a large grant 
 comes from the Wiltshire County       
 Council.
