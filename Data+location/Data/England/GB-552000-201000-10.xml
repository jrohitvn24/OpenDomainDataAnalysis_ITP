		<title>10LEISURE FACILITIES IN ONGAR</title>
		<content>  Leisure facilities in Ongar are quite
 varied for adults, but there is really
 only the Haunt and Ongar Sports Centre
 for teenagers. Organisations like     
 Brownies and Cubs (plus the Sports    
 Centre) are for those of primary      
 age.                                  
  The Sports Centre provided the most  
 popular leisure activities for        
 families in Ongar but other popular   
 activities were those at the Budworth 
 Hall (musical, artistic and dramatic).
  However, most people did not use any 
 facilities in the local area at all.  
 Nor did they go elsewhere, so it      
 seems either not all tastes are       
 catered for, or people do not realise 
 what is available.                    
  When asked what is needed in Ongar   
 the most popular answer was better    
 shops along with more car parking, a  
 cinema and a better bus service.      </content>
