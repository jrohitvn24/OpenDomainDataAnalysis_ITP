<title>23Shopping in Tamworth</title>
<content>

Shopping in Tamworth has changed massively in the past 20 years. The main change being the out of town shopping development - Ventura. Shops here include Asda, Sainsburys, Marks and Spencer, Boots, Next, HobbyCraft, Matalan, Comet, Currys, Argos and soon to open John Lewis, to name a few. This has taken a lot of trade from the town. The shops in Gungate Precinct became empty and the area has now been flattened along with the old Co-Op diary to make way for a car park. Hopes of redeveloping this area are in the pipeline. Akerside shopping centre still holds some big names such as Boots, Argos, HMV, Clarks, Body Shop and Clintons. Market Street saw Home Bargains fill the old Woolworths property.   &lt;br />
