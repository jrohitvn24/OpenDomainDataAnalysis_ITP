Quernmore Sports are held every year on
a field in Quernmore on the third      
Saturday in May. It is a very popular  
day for people of all ages, the younger
ones are enjoying all the activities   
and the older ones are watching them   
and thinking about what they did when  
they were young.                       
      The day starts with sheepdog     
trials held in a neighbouring field.   
The first run is about 8 a.m. and the  
competition goes on all day until it is
nearly dark, with people coming from   
all over the country to take part.     
      The actual sports start in the   
afternoon with the Fancy Dress Parade. 
This is always well supported and the  
judges have a hard job choosing the    
winners for the six classes. The best  
overall winner gets the Riley cup.
