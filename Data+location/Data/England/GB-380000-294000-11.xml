		<title>11GARDEN CENTRES NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   Whether it is the situation, with a 
busy main road running through the     
area,or some quality in the soil which 
makes  it particularly suitable for    
horticulture is uncertain, but the fact
remains that there are no less than    
five garden centres or nurseries within
this block.   Some are general, selling
all types of garden requisites, others 
specialise in particular plants (e.g.  
roses or trees) and some include fruit 
and vegetable produce in their stock.  
   One, previously owned by a now      
deceased television personality is     
especially popular and offers its      
customers extra amenities such as      
refreshments.   Some of the nurseries  
also offer popular "pick your own"     
facilities and between them the garden 
centres attract large numbers of people
from the West Midlands, most weekends.
