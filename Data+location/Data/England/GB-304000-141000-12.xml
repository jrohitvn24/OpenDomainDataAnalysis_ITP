		<title>12RECREATION IN WATCHET</title>
		<content>{FOOTBALL AND CRICKET}- In Watchet     
 there are good Football and Cricket   
 teams who play on Saturday on the     
 Memorial Ground with their own club   
 houses. In football there is a 1st,   
 Reserve and Colts team (for boys) who 
 play in Somerset Leagues.In cricket   
 there is also a 1st and 2nd eleven.   
 Other football and cricket teams play 
 on Sunday.                            
{MAJORETTES}- At majorettes we learn   
 routines,spins and flips with a baton.
 When we are good we give a display.We 
 wear a pink top, blue skirt, white    
 daps, and a white hat with a pink     
 feather.                              
{MONOPOLY}- is a popular indoor board  
 game for up to 6 players.The idea is  
 to keep on buying property you land   
 on,until the other players have no    
 property or money left then they are  
 out of the game.                      </content>
