		<title>06OUR PARENTS' JOBS</title>
		<content> Almost all our parents have jobs of   
 one kind or another.                  
 Quite a lot of people teach in schools
 or at cambridge univesity.            
 The next most common full_time type   
 of job is the building trade.         
 Office workers form a big group but   
 most of these jobs are part_time.     
 Domestic jobs also tend to be         
 done by mothers working part-time.    
 Although we live in the middle of a   
 farming area very few parents work in 
 agriculture.                          
 One quarter of our parents work in the
 village;most of these in part-time    
 jobs.The rest commute to Cambridge or 
 further.                              
 No parents are classed as unemployed.
