		<title>13FARMING IN HARNHILL (CONT).</title>
		<content> In the latter part of 1984, Mr Henly  
 was joined by a daughter and          
 son-in-law,who foresee a possible     
 fundamental change in the Harnhill    
 farming system for the future. EEC    
 cereal production is already in       
 surplus to demand and a likely        
 consequence may be either quota       
 restrictions or lower cereal prices,  
 or both; but the family are also      
 aware that there is a rising demand   
 for organically grown milling wheat.  
 In response to this prospect,on a     
 small scale initially, some 15 acres  
 of land are being prepared to qualify 
 for the large 'organic premiums' which
 apply to organically grown milling    
 wheat.
