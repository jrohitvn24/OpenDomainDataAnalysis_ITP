		<content>    Block 0376013 is situated on the   
 Cotswold escarpment 18km N of Bath.It 
 is an agricultural area.The small     
 residential section consists of the   
 older part of the village of Horton,  
 recorded in the original Domesday     
 Book. Many of the residents are       
 employed in agricultural work but     
 others commute to Bristol,Bath and    
 further afield.The fringes of the     
 block are in the adjoining parishes of
 Hawkesbury, Badminton and Little      
 Sodbury.The A46 leads from Stroud to  
 Bath through the centre of the block. 
 Holiday and commercial traffic hurries
 through to join the M4 Motorway,its   
 occupants unaware of the variety of   
 life in the apparently quiet fields   
 around.Some tourists pause however to 
 stay at the Petty France Hotel or to  
 tread the Cotswold Way and enjoy our  
 rural delights.           D.G.Cooksley</content>
