		<title>04A DAY IN MY LIFE IN LANGTOFT</title>
		<content> It was my birthday,I was going to be  
 nine.Two of my friends were coming to 
 Peterborough with me to watch Indiana 
 Jones at the cinema.Deana was late,so 
 we went on,hoping that we would meet  
 her on the way to pick up Michelle.   
 Just as we got off our drive,Deana's  
 car came round the bend, she gave me a
 wooden doll.Deana's mum took us to the
 crossroads and Michelle was there     
 waiting for us.Soon the bus came we   
 decided to go to the back seat,so that
 we could wave to the cars behind us.It
 was busy at Queensgate and we nearly  
 got lost.We all had some money so we  
 went to a newsagents and bought A My  
 Little Pony each.It was time to go to 
 the cinema,so we decided to make our  
 way to it.It was hot in the cinema,so 
 we got some drinks.The film was good  
 and soon it was the end,we went to the
 bus station and got the bus.by A.Birch</content>
