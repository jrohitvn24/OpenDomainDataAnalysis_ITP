 Much of the work of the centre lies in
 the identification and where necessary
 advice on the render safe procedure of
 items of explosive ordnance recovered 
 by Nato bomb disposal teams.          
 A vital roll of the Custodian is to be
 available to answer questions directly
 from bomb disposal teams who are      
 actually working on bombs they cannot 
 identify themselves. He must be able  
 to provide them with the necessary    
 imformation as quickly as possible    
 from the description they give to him.
 At present the centre is working on   
 computerising the library's catalogue 
 of imformation so as to speed up the  
 search procedure. During last year    
 EODTIC identified 348 items of        
 ordnance and responded to 545 requests
 for imformation.
