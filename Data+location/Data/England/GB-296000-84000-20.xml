There are a number of species of fish  
caught in the Estuary,in their         
season:flukes(dabs),grey mullet and    
shellfish.Salmon are THE catch.The     
South West Water Auth licenses 18      
crews to net salmon below Retreat.     
Between Feb and Aug,two hours before   
low water crews from Topsham and       
Lympstone will row to narrow parts     
of the river(0296500854 'Wrange',      
0296700862 'The   Cupboard').The       
shoreman will take one   end of the    
400 yd net and the boatmen will take   
the other round in a circle, enclosing 
up to three-quarters of the channel.   
The net is then hauled ashore and the  
'bunt'is watched closely for signs of  
a fish. Catches  are much rarer these  
days(pollution,disease),an average of  
perhaps 80,6 to 10lb fish each @
