		<title>13FARMING GREAT PAXTON-OFFORD</title>
		<content> In this area it is mainly arable      
 farming with the main crops being     
 barley,wheat and oats. Each year in   
 late summer the crops are harvested   
 andsometimes winter wheat is          
 planted.Recently,farmers have been    
 growing oil seed rape which brings in 
 a good price,so in the spring the     
 fields are a mass of bright yellow    
 flowers.There are five farms in the   
 block-Waterloo Farm,Low Farm, College 
 Farm,Cotton Farm and New Close Farm.  
 There are very few animals on these   
 farms,only a few horses and cows.     
 All the farms use tractors and        
 Combine Harvesters.Some they own and  
 some they hire,because the smaller    
 farms can't afford to buy their own.  
 The farmers used to bale straw and hay
 in rectangular bales but now they roll
 it in  to sausage shapes.
