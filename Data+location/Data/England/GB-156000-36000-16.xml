		<title>16Cornwall Copper Company</title>
		<content> The Cornwall Copper Company used to   
{smelt copper}at its works in Hayle    
 many years ago. When the copper was   
 smelted the slag was made into large  
 blocks called{scoria blocks.}There is 
 a house made from scoria blocks and   
 this was the works office. Many       
 houses, walls and bridges were made   
 out of these blocks. They were very   
 heavy and cost 6 pence each.{Boats    
{came into a dock}near Daniel's        
 Supermarket along the canal. Nearby is
 a road which leads to the Black Bridge
 which was made of scoria,one of the   
 arches is bigger than the other so    
 that the Vicar of Phillack could get  
 his boat through.{The manager of the  
{C.C.C. was John Edwards.}He lived in  
 Riviere House which was built in 1791.
 The company closed down many years    
 ago.
