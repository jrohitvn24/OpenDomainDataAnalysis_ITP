		<title>18FARMING</title>
		<content> The area around Winter Hill is used   
 mainly for the{farming}of sheep and   
 beef cattle.Farmers have drained some 
 of the land and developed it as       
{grassland.}Not many farm buildings    
 are  now occupied by farmers. They are
 being sold off by the Water Authority,
 often to people from the towns.A      
 number of ruined farm buildings are   
 still to be found,particularly in the 
 valley of the River Yarrow.           
                                       
 Ward's Cote Farm,to the north of      
 Belmont,consists of 86 acres.It has   
 Derbyshire{sheep,}Angus and Hereford  
 cattle and some chickens.The sheep are
 sheared each year and the wool goes to
 Bradford.The farm's machinery includes
 a hay making machine,tractors,manure  
 spreader and a harrow.Some fields are 
 used only for grazing whilst others   
 provide a hay crop as well as grazing.</content>
