		<content> There are{4 tiers of government       
 applying to the area,Parish Council,  
 District Council,County Council and   
 Parliament.We propose to describe the 
 functions of the Parish Council as    
 this is pertinent to the area.        
 The{Parish Council}has 9 members      
 elected by their fellow parishioners  
 for a 4 year term of office.The       
 Council meets on a monthly basis in   
 the Committee Room of the Village     
 Hall.Sub-committees run the{Hall}and  
{Recreation Ground}which are owned and 
 maintained by local fund raising in   
 the main.The{Parish Clerk}is          
 rseponsible for the considerable      
 paperwork and financial matters       
 involved.The Council has an over-view 
 on{Planning Applications}but its views
 need not be heeded by the District    
 Council and often are not!
