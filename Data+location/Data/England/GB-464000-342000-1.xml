 North East of Nottingham in the Trent 
 Valley.Most of the housing and the    
 school were constructed post war 1939 
 -45 on farming land released as       
 building land.There is no riverside   
 development for the land on the river 
 bank is classed as flood meadow,and is
 owned by the Severn Trent Water       
 Authority who use the meadows for     
 grazing.Within the community there are
 no industrial units,even though there 
 were stocking frame knitters and      
 bonnet makers in the 18th and 19th    
 Centuries.The majority of working     
 adults commute to Nottingham, but some
 are employed in the local services.It 
 is possible to shop in Burton Joyce   
 for all commodities except clothing &amp; 
 furniture.Clubs &amp; Societies ensure a  
 varied social life for all ages.      </content>
