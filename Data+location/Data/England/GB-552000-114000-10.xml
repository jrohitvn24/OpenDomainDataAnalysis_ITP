		<content> East Hoathly has an industrial area.  
 Health pills are made from imported   
 materials from Japan, Norway, U.S.A.  
 and exported worldwide. Another firm  
 makes ear defenders and masks for home
 use and export. There is an Aerospace 
 Factory. An agricultural engineer     
 mends and makes farm machinery.       
 Farming and forestry are important,   
 especially in Chiddingly. The Stud has
 bought 500 acres of land. They have 54
 mares and employ 13 people.           
 A fencing firm buys wood from the Con-
 tinent, they work on local contracts. 
 Traditional Sussex smocks are made by 
 gifted local needle-women and sold    
 from a small shop converted by the    
 designer, Mrs.J.Akers-Douglas. Vill-  
 agers work either in the area or go   
 out to local towns and a few commute  
 to London but others come in to work. 
 The factories use modern technology.  </content>
