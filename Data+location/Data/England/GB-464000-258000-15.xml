		<title>15THE FORRESTERS' ARMS</title>
		<content>The Forresters's Arms has always been a
public house. A while ago a man called 
Tom Rolfe used to run the pub; they    
named a street after him {Rolfe        
Crescent}. There used to be a garden in
the front of the pub and at the back   
there were four cottages; Mrs Fortna   
used to live in one of the cottages and
she always used to wear a cap - a white
one on the weekdays and a cream one at 
the weekends. Now the garden is at the 
back of the pub and the cottges have   
been demolished. During the war a 14   
year old evacuee was killed after      
falling on the spiked railing outside  
the pub. Last year my parents took over
the pub from my grandparents. We sell  
about 250 gallons of beer a week and we
do snacks. In the summer we are going  
to do children's cocktails; the        
children will be safe in the garden    
while their parents are in the pub.    </content>
