		<content> The Hallaton and District{Women's     
{Institute}meets in the Stenning Hall  
 monthly. There are about 25 members.  
{Snooker}can be played any evening in  
 the upstairs room in the Stenning     
 Hall.{The Hallaton Sports and Social  
{Club}is organised for and by villagers
 and the surrounding community, and is 
 another focus for village life.       
 Founded in the early 1980's, the club 
 began by renting the recreation field 
 from the Stenning Charities. There is 
 a football and cricket pitch, and the 
 old grass tennis courts have just been
 replaced by new hard courts, which are
 being put to good use. There is also a
 children's play area still being      
 developed, and a pavilion built from  
 the bricks of old farm buildings by   
 club members. The club holds events   
 throughout the year, and its main fund
 raising is a Gala Day in August.      </content>
