     TODAY THE MOST POPULAR PETS FOR   
CHILDREN ARE RABBITS AND GUINEA PIGS.  
SOMETIMES GERBILS,HAMSTERS AND MICE    
ARE POPULAR FOR A TIME.                
     THERE ARE OTHER PETS THAT ARE A   
BIT HARDER TO LOOK AFTER INCLUDING CATS
AND DOGS.OCCASIONALLY,ODD PEOPLE LIKE  
SUCH STRANGE PETS AS SNAKES.           
     RABBIT FOOD CONSISTS OF SUNFLOWER 
SEED,CABBAGE AND CARROTS.GUINEA PIGS   
EAT MUCH THE SAME.THE BEDDING FOR      
THEM IS USUALLY STRAW AND THEY NEED    
TO BE KEPT WARM IN WINTER.             
     IT SEEMS RATHER STRANGE AND SAD TO
THINK THAT MY PETS HAVE A BETTER LIFE  
AND BETTER FOOD THAN PEOPLE IN         
ETHIOPIA.I HOPE THAT, BY THE TIME YOU  
READ THIS, EVERYONE WILL HAVE ENOUGH   
TO EAT AND DRINK.
