		<content>      In case of accidents men are     
 trained at the{Miners Rescue Station} 
 for rescue work in coal mines. Dangers
 can arise from fire, poisonous or     
 explosive gases and flooding.         
 Breathing apparatus is stored and     
 checked in the proto room; we tried on
 the apparatus and it was very heavy.  
      Under the rescue station at      
 Houghton are{galleries}where low dark 
 tunnels and wooden dummies which the  
 men carry on stretchers make it seem  
 like the real thing. We explored here 
 wearing safety helmets and lights.    
{Canaries}are bred in the station and  
 are still used to detect poisonous    
 gas.                                  
      In the{duty room}are maps, plans 
 of each coal-mine, served by the      
 station and telephones which are      
 always manned ready for any appeals   
 for{help}to be answered.              </content>
