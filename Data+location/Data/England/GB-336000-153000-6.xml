COTTAGE TYPE HOUSES SITTING WITHIN WELL

BANKS CONTAIN LUSH GRASS OR CUT HAY    
READY FOR WINTER STORAGE.CATTLE GRAZED 
QUIETLY.                               
    ON THE EDGE OF THE RIVER,A HERON   
STOOD IMOBILE SEARCHING FOR ITS MEAL   
AND THUS DEPRIVE A NEARBY ANGLER OF HIS
CATCH.       A TRULY RURAL SCENE.      </content>
