		<content> THE FARMS OF THIS AREA DATE BACK IN   
 MANY INSTANCES MANY HUNDREDS OF       
 YEARS.THIS CAN BE SEEN BY NAMES SUCH  
 AS HOLLOWAY BARTON,THE WORD BARTON    
 BEING A LOCAL TERM FOR MEANING        
 CORNFARM. CERTAIN FARMERS HAVE BEEN   
 FORCED BY ECONOMICS TO CHANGE FROM    
 DAIRY CATTLE TO BEEF CATTLE. THE      
 REASON BEING THAT AS DAIRY CATTLE     
 REQUIRE MILKING TWICE A DAY THEY ARE  
 MORE LABOUR INTENSIVE THAN BEEF CATTLE
 REARED PURELY FOR THEIR MEAT. THIS    
 ALETATION CAN BE SEEN IN THE CHANGES  
 INSIDE FARM BUILDINGS.SHEEP ARE ALSO  
 KEPT WITH LAMBS BEING BORN AROUND     
 CHRISTMAS TIME.THE WOOLEN INDUSTRY    
 THRIVES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTY  
 AS SMALL CRAFTSMEN REVIVE COTTAGE     
 INDUSTRIES CONCERNED WITH THE         
 SPINNING,WEAVING AND DYING OF WOOL.
