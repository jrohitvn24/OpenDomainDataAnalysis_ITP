		<title>18Tuffley's Churches.</title>
		<content>  The Tuffley area is served by three  
 Anglican Churches (St. George, Grange 
 Road _ St. Michael, First Avenue _ St.
 Barnabas, Stroud Road), one Baptist   
 church in Grange Road and one Roman   
 Catholic church in Tuffley Lane.      
  None of the buildings is over 50     
 years old  because they were built as 
 Tuffley was developed from a hamlet.  
  The most recent one (Catholic) was   
 opened in 1984, being used at present 
 for Sunday services only.             
  The steeply pitched concrete portal  
 frame building of St. George was      
 constructed in 1956 and the adjoining 
 church centre in 1971. A striking and 
 unique feature inside the church is   
 the "Last Supper" reredos.
