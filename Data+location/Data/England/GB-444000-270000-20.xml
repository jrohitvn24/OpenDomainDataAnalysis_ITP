		<title>20THURLASTON FETE</title>
		<content>Summer time comes around again!        
Saturday 22nd June we hear in the      
Advertiser "was the day of the         
Thurlaston village fete...Joan Sullivan
opened the fete in a pleasing manner". 
Attention centred on the village hall  
to which half the proceeds went. The   
other half went to the church. There   
was a raffle and many other side shows 
including darts and skittles. The fete 
raised 415 pounds.                     
"Tea served in the village hall with   
home-made cakes,was deservedly popular.
The brave enjoyed ice cream and        
sqash..." Altogether "an essentially   
English afternoon once again stressed  
the values of life in a Warwickshire   
village."                              
                                       
GOODBYE FROM 2E AND EVERYONE AT        
DUNSMORE GIRLS SCHOOL!
