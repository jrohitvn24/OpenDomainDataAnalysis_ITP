		<title>05POSTLIP HALL - Pt.1</title>
		<content> Postlip Hall,an Elizabethan gabled    
 house, is now owned and occupied by a 
 family commune. It was taken over on  
 1st July 1970.There are about 45 rooms
 with families living together sharing 
 the work load and the expenses. The   
 grounds cover 15 acres. They keep 17  
 sheep,34 chickens and 2 pigs. They are
 self-sufficient. When the Hall was    
 bought for use as a commune, it cost  
 20000 needing a further 40000 to    
 patch it up.                          
 The bulk of the house was built in    
 1614. There is a Norman Chapel        
 belonging to the Catholic Church.Using
 a portable organ, a Service is held in
 it once a year. Members of the commune
 each have a house to themselves, the  
 houses forming a courtyard. Families  
 eat seperately but have a'common room'
 where they can get together and have a
 chat.                       (4)       </content>
