		<title>04Landscape in Little Sodbury.</title>
		<content> Little Sodbury is a quiet place.It has
 a very nice landscape,there are no    
 shops or factories although,there is  
 one primary school at nearby Horton,  
 and one telephone box.The landscape is
 mostly hills and trees.The houses in  
 the landscape are mainly old and they 
 blend into the landscape.There are    
 very few new houses,so instead the old
 houses are being renovated.The        
 woodland in the area has quite a bit  
 of wildlife,mostly birds.The fields   
 are mostly for grazing animals.This is
 because the clay soil in the Little   
 Sodbury area is very suitable for     
 growing grass.There are some crops of 
 wheat and barley.On Chipping Sodbury  
 Common is the golf course.Model       
 aircraft flying has been banned from  
 the Common,because there has been a   
 lot of trouble from the aircraft,     
 disturbing the cattle.                </content>
