		<content> MANY YOUNGER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
 GREATER PROVISION OF LIVELY PURSUITS  
 WHILST OLDER ONES PREFER THE RELATIVE 
 TRANQUILITY OF THEIR EXISTENCE.       
 ONE COMMON PROBLEM WITH WHICH MANY    
 DIVERSE GROUPS ARE BATTLING IS THAT OF
 DIMINISHING PROVISION AND AVAILABILITY
 OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT. AS THE PROBLEM   
 BECOMES MORE ACUTE THERE IS LIKELY TO 
 BE A RISING TIDE OF DISSATISFACTION.  
 WHILST THOSE WHO ARE MOBILE CONTINUE  
 TO HAVE THE OPTION OF TRAVELLING TO   
 NORTHAMPTON FOR ENTERTAINMENT, WORK   
 AND SHOPPING THOSE UNFORTUNATES WHO   
 HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE MAY FIND          
 THEMSELVES WITH FEW LOCAL SERVICES    
 AVAILABLE - AS IN THE CASE OF HOLDENBY
 WHICH HAS RECENTLY LOST ITS VILLAGE   
 SHOP AND POST OFFICE - A REAL BLOW FOR
 THE ELDERLY RESIDENTS IN PARTICULAR   
 AND THE ENTIRE VILLAGE AS A FOCAL     
 POINT IS DESTROYED.                   </content>
