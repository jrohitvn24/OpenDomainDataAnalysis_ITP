		<content> Read's Farm is a well kept{dairy}farm 
 of 81 hectares. It has a herd of l70  
 cattle, l00 of which are dairy cows.  
 The farm is run by the farmer and just
 two other workers. Read's Farm has    
 absorbed the fields of two other      
 farms, Cook's Farm and Green Park     
 Farm. Cook's Farm is now a private    
 house, and Green Park Farm is         
 derelict. Nearly all the fields are   
 used for growing grass, and the cattle
 remain in the fields until the end of 
 October. They are then moved into the 
 sheds and fed on protein and silage   
 for the winter. The farmer has to     
 produce enough silage from his fields 
 to last until Spring. The dairy cattle
 yield about{l800 litres of milk}each  
 day, according to season. The milk is 
 collected daily and sent to Newport   
 and then, Guildford.
