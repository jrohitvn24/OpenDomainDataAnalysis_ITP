		<title>19FARMING IN THE GROVE AREA</title>
		<content> The Tudor Hercy family started the    
 area's farming tradition in depth.    
 Sheep were important for the          
 Nottingham Wool Trade.Today only one  
 field of 50 or so sheep was found in  
 the whole area.There are more cattle  
 than sheep but,particularly around the
 village of Grove,field upon field is  
 given over to the growing of wheat and
 barley.Many of the fields are now     
 larger,with the original sub-division 
 hedges missing.Large spraying         
 machines,on their high wheels,were    
 much in evidence early in the summer. 
 Used for both pesticides and          
 fertilisers,they must account for the 
 tremendous increase in yield per acre 
 over recent years.Well  over 100% we  
 were informed! On two local farms     
 goats were kept and their milk was    
 available for sale.Pigeons were also  
 kept by one local household.          </content>
