		<content>  This is a{low density population     
{area.}Bartestree with over 800 people 
 has the highest concentration but in  
 general the area is marked by little  
 housing and few people. Housing is    
 characterised by the modern estates at
 Bartestree and Withington but there is
 a good stock of older housing with    
 more character. Farm houses tend to be
 large and mainly older than 100 years.
  Many of the inhabitants do not work  
 in the area, but commute by car to    
{Hereford}or{Ledbury.                  
  An unusual feature is the number of  
{Gypsies}who reside in the area all    
 year, whose numbers are boosted in the
 late summer by more who come for the  
 hop-picking.The Gypsies live in       
 caravans or "temporary" huts.
