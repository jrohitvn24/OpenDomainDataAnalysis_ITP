		<title>03MY SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> On a school day I get out of bed at 7 
 o'clock and have my breakfast with my 
 mum, my dad and my brother. Then I go 
 upstairs and brush my teeth, make my  
 bed, brush my hair and go downstairs  
 again to pack my bag and get on my    
 bike to go to school. When I get to   
 school it is usually a bit early so I 
 play with my friends until it is 9    
 o'clock and then we all go in. First  
 we have registration and then we sit  
 down and start our work. At 10.30 we  
 go out to play for 15 minutes. After  
 that we work until 12 o'clock when we 
 have lunch and play until 1.15. We go 
 home at 3.15.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
