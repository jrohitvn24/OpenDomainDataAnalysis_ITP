		<title>05Footpaths in Sebergham</title>
		<content>    This area is well served with foot-
 paths though many are little or rarely
 used.  Some of these rights of way are
 bridlepaths which are used by persons 
 riding horses - for pleasure or       
 exercise (of the horse). The most used
 footpath which is also a bridlepath   
 starts at Sebergham Bridge and follows
 the Western bank of the River Caldew  
 for approx. two kilometres through    
 Dentonside Wood before leaving the    
 river where the bank is too steep.    
    The path continues at a higher     
 level through some recently fenced    
 parkland and through Parsons Park, a  
 forest, and so to Caldbeck.  This path
 forms part of what is known as the    
 Cumbrian Way and is used by tourists  
 on hiking holidays.                   
    Dub Mill Spout flows out of an un- 
 derground system into the River Caldew
 near this path.                       </content>
