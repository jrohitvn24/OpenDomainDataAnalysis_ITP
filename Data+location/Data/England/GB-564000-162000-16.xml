		<title>16RECREATION _ NORTH DOWNS</title>
		<content> This beautiful area is very popular   
 for horse riding because of the       
 availability of grazing land and      
 stables.  There are numerous bridle-  
 ways and narrow lanes, and people come
 even from London for some peaceful    
 hacking.                              
 The chalk hills and woodland have an  
 extremely rich flora and fauna and    
 therefore the area is frequently      
 visited by botanists, ornithologists  
 and sketching enthusiasts; school     
 parties often come for nature rambles.
 In spring late night walks are        
 arranged to hear the nightingales,    
 while in autumn fruit pickers come for
 mushrooms, cob nuts and other hedgerow
 berries.                              
 The steep scarp of the North Downs at 
 Holly Hill is ideally suited for      
 flying kites and model planes, and for
 picnicking and dog walking.           </content>
