		<title>18ATTITUDES TO VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content>   Many people like the village because
it is quiet and peaceful. Ever since   
the Quarry Centre has opened people    
have thought that the village has been 
improved. Before there were many shops 
around the village, but they all       
closed down. Some people think that    
the village has changed too much and   
should change back to what it was.     
There used to be a village policeman   
and he went around to schools all over 
the Weald and tell people about road   
safety. There is a small bus service   
in the village for people who go to    
Tunbridge Wells for their shopping.    
The post office in the Quarry Centre   
is liked by pensioners and people who  
get their pensions and allowances.     
Most hope that more people could move  
into the village to become a thriving  
population again.
