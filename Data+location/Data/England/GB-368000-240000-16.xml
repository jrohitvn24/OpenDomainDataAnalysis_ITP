		<content> A few years ago, 2 members of the     
 Parish Council organised the clearing 
 and marking with yellow signs, of     
{local footpaths.}Maps are available   
 and walks suggested in a bi-annual    
 letter.                               
 The mixed woodland, on good limestone 
 soil, attracts many flora and fauna,ie
 badgers, and there is{concern}over a  
 rumour that woods on the fringe of the
 village may be sold and felled.       
 A 2 acre field has recently been      
 planted with a{collection of native   
{British trees,}a space being left for 
{wild flowers.}A field at Longworth,   
 protected by the Nature Trust, had 400
{green winged orchids}this year and    
 also the very rare{Devils Bit Scabia. 
 A small area in the village known as  
 The Pleck (meadow), bought from the   
 Malvern Hills D.C. has been{cleared   
 of rubbish and{planted with tree-kits.</content>
