These twelve grid squares are situated 
to the north west of Northampton. The  
main centre of population is the       
village of West Haddon. In the 1981    
Census the population of West Haddon is
given as 852 persons.                  
The village is situated at the junction
of the A428, the main Rugby to         
Northampton road, and the B4036, the   
route from Daventry to Market          
Harborough.It is characterised by a    
wide variety of house styles reflecting
the development of the village,        
availability and cost of materials, and
fashion.                               
The area is distinctly rural and the   
land cover is farmland. There is little
locally based employment and most      
residents commute to Daventry, Rugby,  
Northampton, or more distant places for
their work.                            </content>
