		<title>16The George Billington Lock.</title>
		<content> We all walked down to the river and   
 saw the lock. The lock is necessary   
 because there is a weir.Mr. Hutchings 
 works for the Upper Avon Navigation   
 Trust and he told us all about the    
 lock, the old mill and the tower.     
 After Mr.Hutchings had explained      
 everything we shut both gates and let 
 some water in .When the water had     
 stopped coming in  we opened one gate 
 and in came a boat.When the lock was  
 full we opened the other gate and the 
 boat floated through.We looked at the 
 navigation tower.The tower is used    
 for giving instructions.After we had  
 looked at the navigation tower we saw 
 the old mill.There used to be water   
 round the old mill because it used to 
 help grind the flour.The lock is named
 after George Billington who died aged 
 thirty two from cancer.It is a lovely 
 place to visit.                       </content>
