		<title>02HOMES IN WILMSLOW</title>
		<content>  Many of the houses in Wilmslow are   
{detached ,semi-detached or terraced   
 Most have{garages,}but some  people   
 park their cars outside their house.  
 Nearly all the houses have front and  
{back gardens. }For a{four bedroomed,  
{detached house,}you would probably pay
 about 60,000 pounds.

{ SAMANTHA'S HOME                      
  My house was built in 1867.It was    
 owned by a farmer and a brigadier.The 
 farmer named the house{Maxwellton     
 after his black horse. During the last
 war people who lived in the houses in 
 Welton Drive sheltered in our cellars 
 till the bombs had stopped. After the 
 war,the house,which was very large was
 divided into two. The half I live in  
 was called{Kelstern. }
