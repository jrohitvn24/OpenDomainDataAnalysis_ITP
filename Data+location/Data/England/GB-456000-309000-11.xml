		<title>11DANCES IN BIRSTALL</title>
		<content> Every Friday there is a disco at the  
 Stonehill Youth Club.{"Break Dancing" 
 is all the rage now. Dancers spin on  
 their heads, backs or hands all over  
 the floor.{"Body Poppin'"}involves    
 movements of the body e.g. waving the 
 body and locking it into different    
 positions.                            
    There are{crews}(groups of dancers)
 in Birstall called the"Space Cowboys",
 "Heat Beat Crew" and "Electro Rock    
 Future Shock".                        
    It is a very athletic form of solo 
 dancing which mainly involves boys.   
 Dancers wear track suits, trainers,   
 head and wrist bands. The most        
 fashionable make at present is "Nike".
    The dancing is usually accompanied 
 by loud music from a{Ghettoblaster    
 (large radio). This style of dancing  
 started in the poor black areas of    
 America.                              </content>
