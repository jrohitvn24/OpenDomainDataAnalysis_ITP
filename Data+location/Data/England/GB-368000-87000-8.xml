		<content> In our area are two patches of        
 allotments, A is in{Herringston Rd.}  
 and B is in{Alington Ave.}Altogether  
 there are about eight acres of        
 allotments. In area A there are       
 approximately forty plots and in B    
 there are seventy to eighty. The rent 
 for each plot is Â£4.50 per year.      
 People say that they have allotments  
 for the following reasons:-           
 Some live in flats with no gardens.   
 Some just enjoy the hobby of gardening
 and some grow vegetables to eat.      
 Most people with allotments live close
 by, and work in them regularly. The   
 things most often grown are potatoes, 
 broad beans and runner beans.         
 If the new by-pass takes the Southern 
 Route, some of the allotments will be 
 lost, but there will be some new ones 
 created in small pockets of left over 
 land.                                 </content>
