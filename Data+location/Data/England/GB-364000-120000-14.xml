		<content> In the main the{old houses}and        
 cottages are built of stone quarried  
 locally and there are several disused 
 quarries in the area.Of note is the   
{Tudor Manor}in Poyntington,where Sir  
 Walter Raleigh was a freqent visitor. 
 Also in that village is a large tithe 
 barn,now converted into an attractive 
 residence.The hamlet of Milborne Wick 
 once boasted two watermills.One wheel 
 remains as part of a water gardens at 
 Manor Farm.An isolated crescent of    
 farm cottages,known as Waterloo       
 Crescent,built to commemorate the     
 battle,remains vitually unaltered from
 the exterior,though modernised within.
 In both villages many old houses,     
 cottages and farm buildings have been 
 converted to modern residences without
 losing their old world charm.Building 
 of new houses is under strict{planning
 control.                              </content>
