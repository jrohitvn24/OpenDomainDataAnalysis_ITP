		<content> There is no heavy industry in this    
 block but various enterprises have    
 sprung up, giving local employment.   
 Small farms have, in many cases,      
 ceased to be viable as separate       
 holdings. Some have been absorbed into
 larger units, others have to rely on  
 extra income provided by the wife     
 working away from home or in many     
 cases the farmer takes a second job   
 while the wife keeps things going at  
 home and on the farm. Sometimes       
 Farmhouses and buildings have been    
 taken over by people starting up light
 industrial projects, a case in point  
 being Bounds Cross where plastic bags 
 are made. Cider factories once        
 abounded but have almost disappeared. 
 One, mentioned in the intro, situated 
 beside the Bell Inn and now producing 
 plastic stampings, is a family concern
 and employs only 5 people.            </content>
