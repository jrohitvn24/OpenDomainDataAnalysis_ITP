 The area is part of the bottom of the{
{STOUR VALLEY}and became flat by the   
 curling movement of the river through 
 many thousands of years. The {        
{CANTERBURY ROAD}from {ASHFORD}and {   
{ASHFORD}to {CANTERBURY RAILWAY}follows
 the flat valley floor, and became     
 almost the north and south boundaries 
 of the area. The area is very open and
 has few trees in sight and nearly     
 always seems breezy. The local people 
 called the nearby village{'WINDY WYE'.
 The soil is good in parts of the area 
 and used for raising crops like wheat,
 potatoes and strawberries. The locals 
 said that parts were used for growing 
 hops and one hop-drying kiln found in 
 the area is now in use for a farm     
 store. This area is open and farmers  
 used fences instead of hedgrows.
