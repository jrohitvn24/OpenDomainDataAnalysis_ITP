		<content>A {computer} uses microchips to enable 
it to store information in the form of 
electrical pulses. They are to used to 
carry out difficult calculations very  
quickly, and with great accuracy. They 
are also used to store large amounts   
of data, such as the information in    
this survey. It is also possible to    
carry out tests and experiments without
using real objects. This saves time and
money. {Computers} have been around for
twenty or thirty years but only in the 
last four or five years have they been 
in common use in {shops, offices, homes
and industries.} Home computers are    
mainly used for playing a variety of   
games. The most popular are {adventure 
games} involving exploration and       
investigation. {Simulations of driving 
and flying are also popular.} A few    
people use there computers for banking 
and shopping direct from their home.   </content>
