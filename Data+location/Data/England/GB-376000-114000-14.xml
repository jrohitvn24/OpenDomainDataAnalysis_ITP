		<content> In Sturminster we have a medium size  
 Fire Station which was built in 1946. 
 There are 11 firemen,4 leading        
 firemen,1 sub. officer and 1 station  
 officer.The firemen are volunteers and
 have part-time jobs, such as a        
 carpenter,postman and a dairyhand.They
 have drill on Thursday evenings at the
 station and sometimes they practise at
 Shephards Warehouse on the Industrial 
 Estate.They have 2 appliances and 1   
 Landrover.The appliances are Bedford  
 TK's.The station has a licensed bar,a 
 full-sized snooker table,a television 
 and 2 dartboards.                     
  The Ambulance Station closed down in 
 1980/81.This caused the loss of about 
 13 jobs.The Station had 3 Ambulances  
 which covered Sturminster and its     
 surrounding villages.The nearest      
 General Hospital at Yeovil.The        
 Ambulances now come from Blandford.   </content>
