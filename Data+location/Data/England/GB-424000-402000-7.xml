		<title>07THE RAILWAY.</title>
		<content> At the beginning of this century      
 Penistone was a busy railway centre at
 the junction of two lines             
 Sheffield-Huddersfield (LMS) and      
 Sheffield-Manchester (LNER) via the   
 Woodhead Tunnel. The line to          
 Manchester was one of the first in    
 Brtain to be electrified because of   
 the length of the tunnel.             
 Now the railway is in decline much of 
 the station is no longer in use,the   
 line to Manchester is closed. Over    
 the past 12 months the overhead power 
 lines have been removed. The line from
 Penistone to Huddersfield is also     
 under threat of closure. The service  
 to Sheffield is quite popular and now 
 runs through Barnsley. A station at   
 Silkstone Common was opened  on that  
 line only last year.
