		<title>13Yews Farm (II)</title>
		<content>    It was Mr Crawley's grandfather who
 decided to move to Yews Farm.  He had 
 cattle, pigs, sheep and horses then.  
 The horses were used to pull the old  
 plough.                               
    Then tractors came into use and the
 Crawleys decided to have a small      
 company that made tractors.  They were
 doing well but they, along with other 
 small companies, were overtaken by    
 Ford and their tractors no longer     
 paid.                                 
    The Crawleys can shop in Hadstock, 
 but for their main shopping they will 
 go to Haverhill, Cambridge or Bishops 
 Stortford, all of which are about the 
 same distance away.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
