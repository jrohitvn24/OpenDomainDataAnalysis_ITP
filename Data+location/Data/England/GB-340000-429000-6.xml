          NEW HAY FARM

When we interviewed Mr. Hough he told  
us the facts above then went on to     
explain more.His land was all grass-he 
did not grow crops,and the farm        
buildings were all brick with asbestos 
roofs.His pigs were crossbreeds and in 
pens.His poultry were hylorids called  
hisex.The cows were for beef only and  
was an artificial inseminator which is 
a place where you get fluid from the   
bull for the cows so they can reproduce
without a bull.
