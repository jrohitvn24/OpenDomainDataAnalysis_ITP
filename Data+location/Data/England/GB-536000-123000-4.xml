		<title>04THE BLUEBELL STEAM-RAILWAY 2</title>
		<content>   British Railway closed the railway  
 in 1959.A society then formed and the 
 track was then bought in 1960 and re- 
 opened.People laughed because they    
 were the first to buy a standard gauge
 track from B.R.The line was named by  
 the society 'The Bluebell Railway'    
 because in May it is covered in       
 bluebells.However,most of the engines 
 were named by B.R. for instance       
 'Stephanie' which was built in 1872.  
 The Railway is a charity although what
 profit there is, is used to restore   
 and extend it.  An extension is       
 planned and when it is opened, meals  
 will be served on board. In winter    
 trains run 3 times a day, but in      
 summer, they run every 40 minutes from
 10.30-18.00. Although some engines    
 were bought cheaply from a scrap-yard,
 and restored, it still costs a pound  
 per mile to run the trains.           </content>
