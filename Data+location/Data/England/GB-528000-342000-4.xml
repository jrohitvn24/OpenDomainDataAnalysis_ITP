		<title>04OUR TRIP TO GREAT YARMOUTH</title>
		<content> It was the first time Keely,Claire and
 Lorraine had stayed at a hotel.Our    
 room No.218 was a bit on the grotty   
 side of things."It's not fair,"we     
 complained."Every other room had a    
 shower or a loo.Not having these      
 facilities proved a problem especially
 to Claire! When we first arrived we   
 took the key from the door.We then    
 went down to dinner.As usual one of   
 the girls was being really revolting  
 at dinner. First of all she put       
 7 spoonfulls of sugar in her tea and  
 started to eat her napkin. We went    
 upstairs to find that we were locked  
 out.We told our teacher  and he said  
 "Well, your're daft!""Oh,"we said and 
 decided to get the master key.That    
 night the third years came to a mid-  
 night feast at 22.45.Suddenly another 
 teacher came in,"Get into your're     
 own room!".she said, so they did.     </content>
