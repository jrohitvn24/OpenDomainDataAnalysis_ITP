		<title>06TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> A recent traffic survey was designed  
 to compare the number of vehicles     
 using the A2 (New Dover Road) and the 
 A257(Canterbury-Littlebourne Rd).  The
 vehicles were also classified         
 according to country of origin using  
 evidence of No. plates.               
 Before the survey was undertaken, it  
 was assumed that the volume of traffic
 using the A2 would be much greater    
 than the A257 which connects          
 Canterbury with Sandwich.  One unknown
 variable,however, was the influence of
 the by-pass route which inevitably    
 diverts some long-distance traffic.   
 15 minute counts at critical periods  
 of the day were carried out.  The     
 times chosen were 8.30am, 12.00 n00n, 
 5.00pm and 9.00pm.  The figures       
 fluctuated considerably through the   
 day but clear patterns emerged.
