		<content> There are 3 main areas of woodland:   
 Oakhill Wood, Shenley Wood and Howe   
 Park. Smaller areas near Whaddon are  
 all that remains of an ancient forest 
 where some oak trees are 1000 years   
 old. The Forestry Commission owns     
 Oakhill Wood and woodlands around     
 Whaddon where they have planted       
 conifers in amongst the indigenous    
 stock. Oakhill Wood is divided up in a
 grid of bridleways and firebreaks.    
 There are a number of footpaths and   
 bridleways including a section of the 
 North Buckinghamshire Way, often muddy
 in winter, and some though marked on  
 the map have since disappeared. You   
 may see animals such as deer foxes and
 badgers in the woods. The land is     
 slightly undulatind and is            
 interspersed with many brooks and     
 small ponds, some the remains of      
 ancient moats and medieval fishponds. </content>
