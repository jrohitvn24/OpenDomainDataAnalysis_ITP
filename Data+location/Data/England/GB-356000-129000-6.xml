		<title>06Lovington School</title>
		<content>   Lovington School,one of the oldest  
 in Somerset,was started in 1716 when a
 kind farmer bequeathed the rents of 9 
 acres of pasture land at Foddington to
 be used for the schooling of the "poor
 children of Lovington for ever".      
   Today, up to 40 children from a wide
 area attend the school, very few      
 actually living in Lovington.Two full 
 time staff teach one class of Infants 
 and one of Juniors in the old but well
 equipped schoolroom.                  
   Parents and villagers provide strong
 support at social events and take part
 in work projects and fund raising.    
 Attempts to close the school have     
 twice been thwarted by public         
 pressure because of its importance as 
 the centre of village life.
