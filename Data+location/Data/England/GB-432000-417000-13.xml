		<title>13Pig Farming</title>
		<content> After the Second World War,government 
 after government have asked farmers to
 produce more and more food to feed the
 country.Today in the {European        
{Community}we have more food than we   
 can use and still over half the world 
 is starving.In our "D"block,Mr.R.Youde
 owns a pig and poultry farm.Forty     
 years ago pigs had an average of 7.5  
 pigs per litter ,reared 16 pigs per   
 sow per year and the pigs would take  
 4.5 kilos of feed to put on 1 kilo of 
 pig meat.Today,pigs average 10.5 pigs 
 per litter,rear 26 or 27 pigs per sow 
 per year and convert under two kilos  
 of feed for one kilo of pig meat.     
 Poultry,40 years ago would lay 200    
 eggs per bird per year.Today,hens lay 
 300 eggs per bird per year.So things  
 have changed a lot in 40 years.       
 Surpluses are bad ,but not as bad as  
 famine.                               </content>
