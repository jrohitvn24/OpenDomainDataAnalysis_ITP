		<title>12 MRS COMPSON'S DAY</title>
		<content> Mrs Compson gets up at 7.00 a.m each  
 morning on school days and gets       
 dressed. She takes her dogs for a walk
 at 7.30 and then prepares breakfast   
 for her family. At 8.30 she gets into 
 her car and goes to Shorne CE school  
 where she teaches. Mrs Compson arrives
 at Shorne school at about 8.45 and    
 gets the things she needs. She starts 
 school at 8.55 and teaches until 12.15
 with a 15 minute break when she has a 
 cup of tea. Mrs Compson goes home for 
 dinner and returns to teach in the    
 afternoon.                            
 After school she usually takes clubs  
 such as Netball or Rounders. At 5.00  
 pm Mrs Compson plays golf at Rochester
 and Cobham golf course and then goes  
 home to get an evening meal. She then 
 prepares for the next day at school   
 and at 11.00 she goes to bed.
