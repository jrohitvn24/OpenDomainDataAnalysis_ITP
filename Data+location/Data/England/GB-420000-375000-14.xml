		<title>14ATTITUDES OF CHILDREN.</title>
		<content> Rowan and Kate decided to look        
 at Eyam                               
 through their own and other childrens 
 eyes.They made out a time table of    
 their typical days when at school and 
 when on holiday.They also asked other 
 village children of differing ages    
 what they thought about living in the 
 area. Most of the children spoken to  
 had a hobby such as ballet, football  
 and gardening. When asked about       
 entertainment in the village they got 
 some very interesting answers.Most    
 children wanted a BMX course on what  
 they call the Sludge Dam, which is    
 near the playing fields and behind the
 church. Many of children agreed that  
 there was not enough (entertainment)  
 to occupy them and agreed that there  
 should be at least more entertainment 
 around the area. &lt;CONT PAGE 15.>
