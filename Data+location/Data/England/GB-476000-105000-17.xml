		<content>   The majority of the people we asked 
 listed reading,gardening and outdoor  
 sports as their favourite hobbies.    
 Listening to music and watching       
 television were also very popular;    
 indeed we suspect that T.V. has become
 so much a part of everyday life that  
 some people forget to mention         
 it,taking it for granted instead.     
   Indoor pursuits appear more popular 
 than outdoor ones.Many replies        
 mentioned the Home Computer as an     
 interest and playing "Dungeons and    
 Dragons" was frequently cited by young
 males.Model making,it appears,is still
 popular.                              
   Football,cricket,fishing,cycling and
 snooker remain the best loved sports. 
 Going out to see a film has not been  
 killed by the video and the theatre   
 remains popular,if expensive.
