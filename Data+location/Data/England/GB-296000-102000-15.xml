		<title>15Whiteways Cider Factory</title>
		<content>     Whiteways Cider Factory is at{Hele
 (grid ref.996022). It was first built 
 in the 18th century. It was first used
 as a farmhouse. Whiteways has been    
 making{cider}since 1934. Whiteways is 
 the largest drinks factory in Europe. 
 This Hele factory is a small part of  
 Whiteways. The factory used to have   
 15 men working there but now there are
 only 8 men working. On the 29th May it
 closed down. They closed down because 
 it was too small so the men were made 
 redundant. They used to collect apples
 from their orchards and ship them to  
 Shepton Mallet, and ferment the juice 
 to take to Whimple to make cider. They
 also bottled cider in 5 gallon        
 containers. They would bottle 800     
 containers a day. Several{Bradninch   
 people work for Whiteways.
