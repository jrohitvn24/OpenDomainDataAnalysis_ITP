		<title>15WILBERFOSS SMALL BUSINESSES</title>
		<content> As Wilberfoss is a rural area not many
 people work in the village on their   
 own account. However it was found that
 there was a self-employed joiner, a   
 hairdresser,2 garden centre owners,a  
 secretarial agency and a small firm   
 specialising in ready to lay turf all 
 working from or in the village. Most  
 of these people have to work fairly   
 long hours to make a living wage, but 
 think that working for themselves is  
 worth the effort.                     
   Asked about her job the mobile hair-
 dresser said that she started her bus-
 iness because she could see a demand  
 for it.  She has some 7 or 8 clients  
 per day and in 1985 she felt that     
 after being in business for about     
 1 uear, prospects were good. Despite  
 gloomy predictions she has found that 
 there have been few problems and      
 even the dreaded VATis manageable.    </content>
