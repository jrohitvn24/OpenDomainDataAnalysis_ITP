		<title>06The Ring Road</title>
		<content>   The new ring road was opened about a
 year ago. It  goes  round the south of
 Buckingham  and joins up the road from
 the  west{(OXFORD)}with the  one  from
 the east{(MILTON KEYENES and BEDFORD).
   Before the ring road was opened  the
 traffic had to  use  the town  centre.
 This  has {narrow streets}and  awkward
 corners and  was not  able to take big
 juggernaut lorries.                   
   A{protest }group kept  pushing for a
 ring  road. They  even took  part in a
 demostration where they stood right on
 the  edge  of  the  pavement causing a
 traffic  jam because  lorries  had  to
 mount the kerb to  get round  the town
 hall.                                 
   The  survey  shows  that over{80%}of
 through traffic now{uses}the ring road
 and over{90%}of the heavy lorries.
