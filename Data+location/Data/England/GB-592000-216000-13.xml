		<title>13ABBERTON RESERVOIR BIRDLIFE</title>
		<content> Abberton reservoir is one of the best 
 sanctuaries in the British Isles for a
 large number of waterfowl, waders and 
 seabirds as well as local country     
 birds. The reservoir itself is        
 extremely rich in food and fish and   
 can support a large bird population.  
 It is located within 4 kilometres of  
 the estuary of the River Blackwater,  
 where some species go to fish.        
 There are various ducks present       
 including: Mallard, Teal, Wigeon,     
 Gadwall, Tufted, Pochard, Golden Eye  
 and Shoveler. Birds of prey that have 
 visited include: Peregrine Falcon,    
 Kestrel, Marsh Harrier, Sparrow Hawk  
 and Osprey. The Cormorant is breeding 
 successfully at Abberton. Altogether  
 128 different species have been       
 spotted since 1970.
