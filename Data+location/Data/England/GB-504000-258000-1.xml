		<content> Thurleigh is an attractive village    
 situated six miles north of Bedford,  
 midway between the A6 and B660. The   
 area is known as the Willey Hundred.  
 It is made up of a village centre and 
 numerous 'Ends'- Cross End, Scald End.
 The land is undulating Boulder clay,  
 ranging in height from 200ft. to      
 275ft. above sea level. A stream runs 
 through the Parish to the south       
 forming a valley which cuts through to
 the underlying Oxford clay. The       
 countryside around is in the main used
 for arable farming. There are very few
 hedgerows and many trees have been    
 lost due to Dutch Elm Disease. There  
 are two large areas of deciduous      
 woodland. In the north of the area the
 land is owned by the Ministry of      
 Defence and is a large airfield.
