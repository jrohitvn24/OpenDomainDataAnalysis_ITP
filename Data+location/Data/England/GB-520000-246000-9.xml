		<title>09MARKET GARDENING IN SUTTON</title>
		<content> The Land Settlement is made up of     
 smallholdings.The land was given to   
 out-of-work Yorkshire miners in 1935. 
 These men kept pigs,sheep and cows    
 there.The ex-miners did not find this 
 type of life to their liking and, in a
 very short time,the holdings had been 
 sold to Market Gardeners.             
 Most of the vegetables grown there are
 salad crops.Some of the vegetables    
 such as beans,cabbage and lettuce are 
 grown out in the fields.The more      
 tender plants and those wanted for    
 market early in the year are grown    
 under glass or in polythene tunnels.  
 Most of the crops grown on the Land   
 Settlement are distributed by         
 Bedfordshire Growers-a local          
 co-operative of farmers.The main      
 outlets for the vegetables are the    
 Tesco and Sainsbury supermarkets which
 insist on crops of a uniform standard.</content>
