		<title>07SCHOOLS IN BRADWELL</title>
		<content>   The size of Bradwell has incresed   
 during the last 25 years. In that time
 three new schools have been built. One
 teacher at our school has taught at   
 all these schools. He came to teach in
 Bradwell in 1963. The first school he 
 taught at was{Homefield V.C. Primary. 
 This school was opened in 1961 and was
 built to replace the original village 
 school.Even after the new school was  
 built it was necessary to use the old 
 building as an annexe. The old school 
 is still used as the Community Centre.
                                       
{ "In those days Bradwell was quite    
{small and I knew all of the children  
{by name, and some of their families as
{well. I can remember the railway ran  
{through Bradwell then.You used to be  
{able to hear the toot of the whistle  
{from the school playground."
