		<title>04THE WHEATSHEAF</title>
		<content>        My house is called "The        
 Wheatsheaf". It is about 300 years    
 old. My Grandad says it is the oldest 
 house in the village.                 
    Many years ago the house was a pub,
 a blacksmiths, a slaughterhouse and   
 butchers, and a bakery.               
    Inside my house there are lots of  
 wooden beams in all the ceilings. The 
 wooden beams came from old ships like 
 Nelson's flag ship. Underneath the    
 pantry there used to be a cellar but  
 it has been filled in now. Outside our
 back door there is an old water pump, 
 It does not work now. At the side of  
 the road, on a brick wall there is an 
 old piece of wood which was used for  
 shaping metal hoops which were put on 
 wooden wheels on farm carts.          
    I have lived here for eight years.
