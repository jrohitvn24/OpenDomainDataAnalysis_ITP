		<content> In the tree-lined streets of Hall     
 Green, most of the homes are owned by 
 the residents. Of the five thousand   
 two hundred and eighty three homes,   
 approximately half are semi-detached  
 while a further eight hundred are     
 detached. Four hundred and fifty one  
 houses are terraced. Forty two old    
 people's bungalows have recently been 
 completed and there are six hundred   
 and ninety one flats. Two hundred and 
 twenty council houses and a hundred   
 council flats are also included       
 together with seventeen pre-fabs.     
 Because of lack of accommodation      
 during the second world war, these    
 were built in the 1940's as an interim
 measure until such time as more       
 permanent homes could be provided.    
 However, they are still occupied in   
 1985!                                 
                                       </content>
