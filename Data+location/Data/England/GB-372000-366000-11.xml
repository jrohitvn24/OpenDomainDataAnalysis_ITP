		<title>11RECREATION IN CRANAGE</title>
		<content>      Most of the homes have gardens   
 and our survey showed that most people
 enjoy gardening. They grow flowers,   
 friut and vegetables.                 
      There are no theatres or cinemas 
 locally and people have to travel to  
 neighbouring town or into Manchester  
 for entertainment of that sort . Some 
 people we talked to do however belong 
 to the choral or dramatic societies   
 nearby.                               
      For people who like sport there  
 is a large Leisure Centre attached to 
 the Comrehensive school. There are    
 various clubs run there inclucling    
 squash and gymnastics. However if we  
 want to swim we have to go to sandbach
 or congleton.                         
      There is also Cranage club which 
 is used during the week for the local 
 playgroup.In the evenings it is used  
 for social events,brownies and cubs.  </content>
