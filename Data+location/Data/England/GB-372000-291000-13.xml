		<title>13Stanmore Industrial Estate</title>
		<content> The land rises steeply from the river 
 valley, up towards the brow of the    
 Hermitage, where it levels off into   
 fields and woodland.  The whole of    
 this slope is solid sandstone with a  
 thin layer of fossil embedded mudstone
 covering it where it has not been worn
 away. It is along this "Hermitage Hill
 Coppice", that The Hobbins, a         
 R.A.F.married quarters still stands,  
 the sole reminder of what was once a  
 very large training center. Most of   
 the land has now been turned over to  
 the Stanmore Industrial Estate, a site
 of numerous small growing industries. 
 The land here is rich and so houses   
 some large farms. With the opening of 
 a new by-pass the present situation   
 is due to change, as new roads bring  
 in more traffic.
