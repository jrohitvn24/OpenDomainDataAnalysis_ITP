		<title>06NATURAL LIFE AROUND FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   Feltwell lies between the Fens and  
 the Brecklands, where there is a large
 warren in the forest. Sometimes the   
 rabbits escape and find their way to  
 the allotments. They cause damage to  
 the crops. Other mammals found in the 
 village are mice, rats, foxes and     
 hedgehogs.                            
   We have most common garden birds and
 also a few wild pheasants. Down by the
 new river we find herons. In the      
 fields live owls and kestrels.        
  The farmland around Feltwell used to 
 be surrounded by elms. The Dutch Elm  
 Disease killed them. The Fens used to 
 be covered in sedge, reeds, alder and 
 willow then farmers drained the land  
 for farming. Now these plants only    
 live in dykes and patches of woodland.
 Along Burdock Lane the landscape and  
 vegetation have hardly changed in the 
 last hundred years.                   </content>
