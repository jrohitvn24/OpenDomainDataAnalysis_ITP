		<title>05BURTON GREEN VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> Burton Green Village Hall was built by
 a local builder and opened in 1983. It
 replaced an old brick and wood        
 building and cost about Â£45,000. It is
 approximately 30feet by 70feet. It is 
 used every day during the week except 
 Sunday for various activities such as 
 old people's groups, mother and       
 toddler groups, playgroups, Brownies, 
 Guides, Cubs, Scouts, dancing and     
 popmobility classes. The Women's      
 Institute use it once a month and     
 sometimes the village school use it   
 for school plays and concerts. A      
 Coventry dancing school use it on     
 Saturday mornings for rehearsals. At  
 weekends the hall can be hired for    
 table tennis, children's parties,     
 wedding receptions, dances or         
 barbecues. It is used for elections   
 and twice a year local people can come
 here to pay their rates.              </content>
