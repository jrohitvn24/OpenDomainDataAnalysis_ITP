		<title>20N.Upottery:Peace and quiet</title>
		<content>   Many of us have settled in this part
 of Devon to escape the noise and      
 polluted atmosphere of cities;and     
 indeed our valley has pure air and the
 silence we sought.Well,...most of the 
 time! We do have the rich odour       
 of fertilisers on the fields for a few
 days in the year,and our peace is     
 sometimes shattered by the sound of   
 tractors at work.But these are a      
 necessary part of country life.What is
 far less pleasant is the appalling    
 screech of military aircraft or the   
 buzz of a helicopter.On summer Sundays
 we can hear the drone of stock-car    
 racing on the old aerodrome.The sound 
 of the holiday traffic on the A-roads 
 however,hardly reaches us;and the     
 tourists who come to us for "Bed and  
 Breakfast"do not disturb the peace and
 tranquillity of this lovely valley.
