   A street survey showed that most    
 people are satisfied with main health 
 facilities but local facilities could 
 be better. More dentists, chemists and
 toilets were favoured.                
   Mental health treatment will be     
 provided locally at Roseberry house   
 and 78% are in favour. 2 local        
 hospitals care for the elderly.       
   Long waiting lists for operations   
 were mentioned as not satisfactory and
 more nurses are required.             
 DENTAL HEALTH.                        
   Out of a class of 27 children, only 
 two enjoy going to the dentist. 8     
 children have braces to straighten    
 their teeth. Silver, tin and mercury  
 are used for fillings, or gold. The   
 dentist says the mercury is not       
 dangerous when mixed.
