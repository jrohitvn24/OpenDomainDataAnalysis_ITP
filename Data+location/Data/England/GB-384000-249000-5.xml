		<title>05THE CHURCH IN KEMPSEY.</title>
		<content>   This nicely situated building was   
 founded in 868 by Bishop Aelhun       
 (848-872) who dedicated it to         
 St.Andrew. During William I's Domesday
 Survey in 1086, a "priest in Kempsey" 
 was recorded so it is a fair          
 assumption that either a small church 
 or chapel was present for the count.  
   Since the start of the church       
 history, sixty six vicars have taken  
 their position as leading members of  
 the church. The present vicar,        
 Reverend Toogood, has recently held a 
 festival of talents in the church nave
 with talents ranging from modelling to
 italic writing. In 1984 he also       
 contributed to a book on the Kempsey  
 parish and the surrounding area. This 
 book was both printed and published by
 the people of Kempsey themselves and  
 was put on sale in the surrounding    
 area.                                 </content>
