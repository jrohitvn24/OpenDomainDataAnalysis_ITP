		<title>14Lutton Village.</title>
		<content>   Lutton is about a mile from         
 Cornwood. In Lutton there is quite a  
 variety of houses. There are farm     
 houses, old and new houses. There is a
 garage and also a pub. The bus route  
 comes from Cornwood through Lutton to 
 Plymouth. There are two bus stops.    
   There is nowhere for the children in
 Lutton to play so we play in the road.
 There are two activities - cubs for   
 boys only and Sunday School. There is 
 no school so children go to Cornwood  
 or Sparkwell schools.                 
   There is no shop in Lutton but there
 used to be one which also used to be  
 the Post Office and a hairdressers.   
 The building is now used as a private 
 house.                                
   There is one telephone box in       
 Yondertown square. There are a few    
 street lights dotted around the       
 village.                Emma Milligan.</content>
