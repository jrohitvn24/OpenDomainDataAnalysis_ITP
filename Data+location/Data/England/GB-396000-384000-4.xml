		<title>04VANDALISM</title>
		<content>    There is a lot of vandalism in the 
 New Mills area.    It is caused by    
 teenagers  who are unemployed and have
 no jobs.    There is a butcher's roof 
 where children and teenagers climb up 
 and slide down the other side and make
 all the slates fall off the roof.     
     There has been a bus shelter just 
 built over Low Leighton which has     
 been written on by vandals.           
     There is a laundrette which has   
 been all boarded up and people write  
 on the wood and try to break into it. 
     We think there should be more     
 facilities for the younger generation.
 There should have been a sports hall  
 built but they built a clinic instead.
