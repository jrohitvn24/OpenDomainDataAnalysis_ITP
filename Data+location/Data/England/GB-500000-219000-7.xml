		<content>  There are eight dentists in          
 Dunstable. We visited one of them. You
 have to work very hard and pass a     
 minimum of  7"O" levels and 3 "A"     
 levels before you can start training. 
 In our town there seems to be more    
 people with decayed teeth than healthy
 teeth. The Dunstable dentists haveto  
 work very hard and on average in a    
 small dentist you would get about     
 forty five to fifty people a          
 day .Usually you have to be 22 to be a
 dentist and be 60 - 65 to retire. The 
 average child in Dunstable has three  
 fillings. In the dentists surgery     
 there are lots of tools such as the   
 probe used for exploring round teeth, 
 the mirror is used to see upper teeth,
 the packer to pack fillings in firmly 
 and the electric drill used to drill  
 into the decay to the tooth. More     
 children need braces to correct teeth.</content>
