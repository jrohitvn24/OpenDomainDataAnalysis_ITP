		<title>07NEAR LEYS FARM (continued)</title>
		<content> ....726 litres.Cleanliness is very    
 important &amp; milk is piped through     
 overhead glass pipes from the milking 
 parlour.An emergency tank is used if  
 snow or bad weather prevents the      
 tanker from reaching the farm.They do 
 not keep a bull but inject the cows to
 give them a calf.Bull calves are sold 
 at the market.Nose operated fountains 
 make sure that the cows can always get
 a drink.We saw 6 cats which seem to   
 run wild round the farm.Mr.Wearmouth  
 was born in this farm &amp; with his      
 father owns &amp; works the 96 acres.He is
 pleased that the cut in his milk quota
 has been restored.He believes in      
 using only natural fertilizers and    
 putting in maximum hours.In fact he   
 has had only 4 days holiday in 14     
 years but he is a cheerful man.
