		<title>04A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LINDA</title>
		<content>     Most Saturdays I watch{Chips}on   
 television.This is a programme about  
 two motor cycle policemen and their   
 job.                                  
     Afterwards I go round to my       
 friend's house and I usually play     
{Great Britain.} This is a board game. 
 You have to travel to places in Great 
 Britain and the first one to finish   
 wins the game.I have a hot dinner like
 sausages,potatoes,beans,peas and      
 gravy.                                
 In the afternoon I help my mum        
 wash up and then I dry up.Afterwards  
 we usually go to Wisbech to the       
 shops but sometimes we go to Kings    
 Lynn.We went to King's Lynn last time 
 to get my sister's dress and shoes for
 our Sunday School anniversary.We go   
 there because there are more shops to 
 choose from.
