		<title>16Denstone Village</title>
		<content>   Denstone is a small rural village in
North Staffordshire sited above the    
flood plain of the River Churnet.It is 
approximately equidistant from the     
market towns of Uttoxeter,Cheadle and  
Ashbourne,coming largely under the     
influence of Uttoxeter.The village ,   
which became a seperate parish in the  
latter part of the 18th century,       
originally served the surrounding      
farming community but is now largely   
residential,several small housing      
estates having recently been built.The 
village provides little employment and 
the amenities are limited to a public  
house,a garage,a small general store,a 
hairdresserÂ£s and a post office.       
   When Denstone was established as a  
parish,a church,school,and vicarage    
were built by Sir Percival Heywood,the 
benefactor of Denstone.
