      Mum spends her day at home       
 cleaning, washing and shopping.  Five 
 nights a week she works as a cleaner  
 in an office in town.  Dad is a welder
 but he hasn't a job at the moment. My 
 mum says he gets in her way           
 during the day.                       
      After school I go and play on my 
 B.M.X. bike at the tip, or football on
 the school field.  Sometimes I watch  
 T.V.  My favourite programme is the   
 A-team.  My sister doesn't go out     
 much.  Mum says she needs a hobby.  My
 brother is always fishing in the River
 Ouse.  Dad goes to the pub sometims to
 play darts.  Mum doesn't go out much. 
 She always says she has no money.     
 Tang Hall is not bad sometimes but I  
 wish we had a sports centre with a    
 swimming pool near our house.
