		<content> This area is disected by the A30 trunk
 road.   Heavy lorries carry           
 agricultural &amp; horticultural produce  
 throughout the year, and in the summer
 months there is additional heavy      
 tourist traffic.   The land falls away
 on each side of this road to the      
 rivers Lyd and Thrushel whiuch flow   
 through wooded valleys, and attract   
 both local and visiting fishermen.    
 The remaining land is devoted to      
 grassland intensively cultivated to   
 support dairy and beef cattle and     
 sheep.   People live either in small  
 hamlets or in isolated farms or       
 houses, and children are transported  
 to schools outside the area, a limited
 number of private coaches take        
 shoppers to nearby towns, but         
 privately owned cars are essential for
 daily work and leisure pursuits.  High
