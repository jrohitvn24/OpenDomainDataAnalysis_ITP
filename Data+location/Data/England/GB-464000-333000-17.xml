		<title>17MINERS STRIKE</title>
		<content> During the miners strike my dad was   
 one of the miners who were on strike. 
 Some days he went to the picket line  
 to try to stop other miners from going
 in to work. Some days he goes to      
 meetings or on a long march. Every    
 week he got some money from the union.
 My mother also went to meetings. The  
 union took me and my brother on       
 holiday to Wales with some other boys 
 whose dads were on strike. When the   
 strike was over we were pleased but we
 agreed with my dad.                   
 Some nights we go swimming and other  
 nights we go to judo.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
