		<title>08BUILDING MATERIALS</title>
		<content>    In this area the building materials
 used are quite different from those   
 employed in nearby Bristol or Bath.   
    Local stone has long been quarried 
 and used to build Mendip cottages and 
 houses. Where builders employed lime  
 mortar and lime washes, stone         
 surrounds were often used to frame    
 windows. Stone mullion windows are a  
 common feature, with lead used to seal
 the glass into the stone.             
    A lot of roofs in this area are    
 covered by clay roofing tiles. The    
 school at the centre of Chewton       
 Mendip is a good example (597,531).   
 Some of the best examples of slate    
 roofs on traditional cottages are     
 along the Folly (596,527). Slate,for  
 many years has been quarried in South 
 Wales  and brought back by boat to    
 England.
