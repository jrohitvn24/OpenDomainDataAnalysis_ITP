		<title>02Coddenham Area Medical Care</title>
		<content> Coddenham village and the area of our 
 block is mainly served by a group     
 practice based at the nearby small    
 town of Needham Market. There is a    
 doctor on duty in Coddenham 1 morning 
 a week and surgery takes place in two 
 rooms in the Country Club. Facilities 
 in the waiting room and surgery are   
 minimal but the waiting room is a     
 prime place to catch up on local      
 gossip. Repeat prescriptions must be  
 placed in a box located outside the   
 surgery on a specific day each week.  
 They are then collected and taken to  
 the dispensary at the practice head-  
 quarters. The medicines are then      
 delivered to Coddenham Post Office    
 to await collection. Further health   
 care is provided by Stowmarket Health 
 Centre, 8 miles away, which sends out 
 Health Visitors and Nurses. Nearest   
 General Hospital is Ipswich, 6 miles. </content>
