		<title>14The Celts in our Area.</title>
		<content>{ }In our area there are tumuli. These 
 are Celtic burial mounds. One tumulus 
 had a whole village of{Bronze Age     
{people}buried inside. Also at{Goodern 
{Manor Farm}there is an Earthwork which
 has a ring of hawthorn bushes around  
 the perimeter.In our area there is one
 Earthwork and five Tumuli.{Carrine    
{Common Tumulus}is the biggest. It     
 stands in the middle of a field where 
 cows graze.In the beginning the {Celts
 probably went there to pray to their  
 dead but now it's just standing idle. 
 Today there are still {Celts}but they 
 are not divided in religion or belief.
 To be a {Celt}you have to be either { 
{Cornish, Scottish, Welsh or Irish}.
