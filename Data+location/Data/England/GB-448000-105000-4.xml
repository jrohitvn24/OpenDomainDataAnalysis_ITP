  Mr Ray Sedgewick has a very unusual  
 job because he is the{Hamble/Warsash  
{ferryman}. He is up in the morning at 
 a quarter to five and works until six 
 o'clock in the evening.               
 Mr Sedgewick only gets two days off   
 every year and that is Christmas Day  
 and Boxing Day.He has been doing this 
 job for{twenty_seven years}.          
  The ferry can carry{ten people}at a  
 time and it costs twenty pence for    
 adults and ten pence for children.    
  The high tide stays for about two    
 hours and then goes out again .The    
 ferry has an outboard motor which     
 helps him cross the quarter of a mile 
 to the other side.                    
  The ferry has a{long history}.The    
 earliest recorded evidence of a       
 crossing between Hamble and Warsash   
 was in{1493}but it could be older.    </content>
