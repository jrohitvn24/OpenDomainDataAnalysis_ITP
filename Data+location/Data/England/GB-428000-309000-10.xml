		<content>  After leveling, the sub base and road
 base are laid using bulldozers and    
 rollers.{The base course}is the first 
 layer of{Tarmacadamised stone}to be   
 laid.A special machine is used to lay 
 the hot tarmac to the correct depth   
 and in the correct place.This surface 
 is immediately{compressed}using heavy 
 rollers. The final wearing surface has
 additional asphalt coated stones added
  The construction is being carried out
 by{Tarmac Construction Ltd.}This      
 section is the second part of the M42 
 which will eventually go from         
{Birmingham to Nottingham.}However from
{Appleby to Nottingham}the road will   
 only be a{Trunk Road,}not a Motorway. 
  Also the delay in starting the next  
 section of road is causing concern in 
{Measham and Ashby}as residents feel   
 more traffic will be generated,causing
 a decline in the quality of life.     </content>
