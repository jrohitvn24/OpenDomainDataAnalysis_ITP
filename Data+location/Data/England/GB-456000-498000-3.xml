		<content> In our infant class only two children 
 live near enough to walk home from    
 school.  Two people live a little     
 further and go home by car. The others
 go home by taxi.                      
 Only two people live in a bungalow.   
 The rest live in houses. One person's 
 bungalow is near the main road, but   
 the rest live at the top of a lane.   
 Nine of us have jobs to do when we get
 home. These include feeding ponies,   
 hens, ducks and pets, collecting eggs,
 bringing in logs,milking a cow and    
 feeding a ferret.Everybody likes      
 outside play best on our bikes.Our    
 favourite T.V shows are Dynasty and   
 Dallas.Sarah listens to her story     
 tapes.Most of us go to bed between 7pm
 and 8pm.Seven of us have our own      
 bedroom and the rest share a room with
 one other person.Nine of us have a    
 bedtime story.                        </content>
