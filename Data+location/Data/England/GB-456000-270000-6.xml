		<content>{St.Margaret's,Crick.}Nobody can say   
 exactly how old the church is but     
 there definitely was one at the time  
 of the Norman Conquest.The main       
 building is about 700 yrs old and is  
 sandstone.{The Font}is a place for    
 baptising children.Holding up this are
 some grotesque figures made of sand   
 stone.They are known to be as old as  
 the church,possibly dating from an    
 earlier church.An appeal for Â£40000   
 has been started to restore the       
 church.The windows are guarded by nets
 to prevent them being broken by       
 vandals.                              
{Kilsby Church.}Rev.Scott looks after  
 this church which is also in need of  
 restoring.The church has a clock tower
 with 4 bells in it.The organ is next  
 to the altar.The Sunday Service is at 
 10.00a.m. and the Cubs,Brownies,      
 Scouts and Guides attend every month. </content>
