		<content>    We found out what people did in    
 their spare time.We did this by asking
 people to pick their three favourite  
 pastimes from a list of twenty-four   
 different activities.They included{   
{sports,}such as{football,swimming and 
{keep-fit,}and less active things like{
{bingo and watching television.}       
    We stood outside by a busy road and
 asked people to answer our questions. 
    From our results we found out that 
{football was the most popular pastime.
 Other favourite activities were{      
{swimming,snooker,dancing and watching 
{television.}                          
    Our biggest surprise was that most 
 women voted for football we thought it
 would be bingo!
