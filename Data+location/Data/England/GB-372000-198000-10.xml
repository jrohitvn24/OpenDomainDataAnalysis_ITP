{A Typical Day in a Primary School.}   
 On Thursday after breakfast I walked  
 to school. First of all we had        
 Assembly. We had prayers, poems, Bible
 readings and a hymn. Our first lesson 
 was mathematics. We did fractions. At 
 playtime we had fun on the grass. I   
 learned how to do a handstand into    
 crab position. Next was physical      
 education. I enjoyed doing a forward  
 roll in the air and landing on the    
 crash mat. For the rest of the morning
 our teacher read us a story called    
 "The Silver Sword". It was exciting.  
 In the afternoon we did comprehension 
 and punctuation exercises. School     
 finished at 3.20 p.m. I went to       
 rounders practice before going home.  
 In the evening I went to Brownies,    
 which is a group of girls who meet in 
 uniform.                              </content>
