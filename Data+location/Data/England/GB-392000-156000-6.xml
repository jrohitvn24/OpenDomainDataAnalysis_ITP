		<content> There are no large centres of industry
 or employment in the Keevil area.     
 Family run farms dominate local in-   
 dustry but do not employ appreciable  
 numbers of workers. Several self-     
 employed business people operate from 
 home in such diverse fields as        
 building,information retrieval and the
 manufacture of knitwear. The latter   
 specialises in the design and com-    
 pletion of original knitwear. One     
 business which exists in Keevil is a  
 home-based wholesale tobacconists,    
 also supplying crisps, etc to the     
 trade. Near Worton, the Devizes Cats  
 Hotel, founded in 1981, has expanded  
 to 24 kiosks to cope with growing     
 demand for the excellent care provided
 by this family business. Hourly paid  
 domestic help is an area in which     
 local demand exceeds supply. Commuters
 travel to Trowbridge,Bath and further.</content>
