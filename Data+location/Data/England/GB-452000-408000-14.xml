		<title>14THE INTERSECTION</title>
		<content>   The A1(M) London to Edinburgh road  
 and the  A638 Doncaster to Wakefield  
 road pass near to school. The A1 is a 
 dual-carriageway and meets the A638 at
 a fly-over intersection. This fly-over
 was built only in 1979 . Before that  
 there was a roundabout which caused a 
 lot of traffic delays . A section of  
 the original Great North Road can     
 still be seen parallel with the       
 dual-carriageway. Red House Farm has  
 been surrounded by all this           
 road-building. The London to Leeds    
 railway line passes under the road.   
 Traffic is heavy on both road and     
 railway.
