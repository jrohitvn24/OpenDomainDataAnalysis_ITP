		<title>12OLDEST INHABITANT INTERVIEW</title>
		<content> Mr Cooper is one of the oldest        
 inhabitants. He has lived in Loxwood  
 all his life. He told us :            
                                       
 I am 84 years old. I used to go to the
 old Loxwood School. There were eight  
 classes then, two of them were        
 Infants. When I left school I went to 
 work in the army. The First World War 
 was terrible.                         
                                       
 Ifold used to be lots of woodland and 
 very damp, but since the 1930's there 
 have been so many houses built.       
                                       
 I remember the Italian Prisoners of   
 War who were made to work on the farms
 during the Second World War. Some of  
 them tried to escape and hid in       
 Devil's Hole, a natural hollow near   
 the Wey and Arun Canal.
