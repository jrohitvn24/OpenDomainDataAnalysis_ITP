		<content> LIFESTYLES.  Approximately 75% of the 
 sample were car owners. Only one      
 household in five had no independent  
 means of transport, although the area 
 is well served by several bus routes. 
    Over half of those interviewed took
 all of their holidays in Britain,     
 whilst one in eight only holidayed    
 abroad. However, about one third      
 enjoyed both types of holiday. One in 
 five said that they never took an     
 extended holiday away from home.      
    In an age of electronics, only one 
 person did not possess a television   
 receiver. Most families had both radio
 and television sets, record-player, a 
 washing machine(but only half had     
 electric driers), refrigerator and    
 freezer. A third of the sample now    
 owned, or rented, a video recorder,   
 and an increasing number of           
 households(25%) owned a home computer.</content>
