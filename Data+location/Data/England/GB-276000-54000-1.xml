 Nearly all of the land in our survey  
 area is used for{farming.}            
                                       
 The area is a patchwork of fairly     
 small fields separated by hedgerows.  
 Some of the fields are quite steep.   
 Nearly all of them provide grazing for
 cattle and sheep.  Many of them are   
 cut for hay or silage.                
                                       
 Hardly any of the land is flat. There 
 is quite a lot of woodland in the     
 area, some of it deciduous and some   
 coniferous. None of these woods is    
 very large but they do make the       
 scenery more interesting.             
                                       
 The area is sparcely populated, mostly
 scattered farms and cottages except   
 for the village of Harbertonford.
