		<title>15Buckden Palace</title>
		<content> Buckden's well known landmark is      
 Buckden Palace which is known in the  
 Village as the Towers. It is          
 not certain how long a palace has     
 stood on the site, the earliest record
 being 1186. The palace's most famous  
 visitor was Catherine of Aragon who   
 stayed there after her divorce to     
 Henery VIII.                          
  Since 1956 The Towers has been owned 
 by the Claretian congregation of      
 Missionaries who have carried out much
 restoration. In 1956 a church was     
 built which now serves the parish of  
 Buckden's catholic community. It is   
 dedicated to St. Hugh of Lincoln.     
  The brothers hold courses for        
 young christians and the Great Tower  
 now contains living accomadation as   
 well as a meeting room for young      
 people.                               
                                       </content>
