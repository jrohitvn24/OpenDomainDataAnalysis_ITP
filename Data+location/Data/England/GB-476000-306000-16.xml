		<content>  {NEWS COVERAGE IN OWSTON AREA        
  Every house in Owston has at least   
 one television and radio. Some also   
 have video equipment and Cee_Fax      
 reception. Newspapers are delivered   
 from Somerby daily and left at the    
 village hall for collection, and on   
 Sundays someone from the village,     
 working on a rota system, collects the
 papers from Somerby and delivers them.
 The Leicester Mercury is delivered    
 round the village every afternoon by  
 one of the residents who also         
 disseminates local news as he goes.   
 Local events are reported to the press
 by a village correspondent living in  
 Owston. A news sheet is produced in   
 Knossington with details of local     
 events and items of village news and  
 this is distributed to every house.   
 The county mobile library calls once a
 fortnight from Melton Mowbray.        </content>
