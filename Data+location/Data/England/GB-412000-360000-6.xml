 Gregory and I live at Hartington      
 station with mummy , daddy and brother
 william . my daddy is a peak park     
 ranger and our house is next to the   
 Tissington trail . I get up at 7 o'   
 clock and get dressed. For breakfast I
 have sugar puffs or shreddies we go in
 the car to school which starts at     
 9 o' clock . My best friend is Kathryn
 Kirkham our favourite game is fairy   
 bunnies at 12 o' clock I have dinner  
 with the other children at school. I  
 like sausages and chips . At 3 o'     
 clock mummy comes to get me . When I  
 get home I usually play . For tea I   
 like haunted house spaggetti. On      
 mondays I go to brownies . Sometimes I
 will go with daddy to look at the     
 birds nests or other things on the    
 trail . I like the gnewts and tadpoles
