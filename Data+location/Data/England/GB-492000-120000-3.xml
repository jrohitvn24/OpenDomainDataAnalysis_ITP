 south of the  main  road  to{ Petworth
 from{Midhurst.} It has a  public house
 called the{ Three Moles,}several farms
 and  a{ Saxon  Church } dedicated   to
 St.James.  The Rector of  Lodsworth is
 also  Rector of  Selham.    The    Old

 the  wallowing  places.'  Selham  lies
 low  in the  valley  of  the  {Western
{Rother. }                             
   In the 18th century  plans were laid
 to  make  the  winding  stream  of the
{Western   Rother  }into   a {navigable
{waterway}for{barges }as well as  small
 craft. For three years{Lord Egremont's
{estate   workers  }eliminated   bends,
 constructed locks  and  built bridges.
{From 1794}lime was brought from pits  
 in Bury  and  Houghton, coal from the 
 Midlands.The last barge of{timber}was 
{exported}by the same route in{1871.   </content>
