		<title>16Changes in Farming</title>
		<content> Lots of small farms have now been     
 swallowed up by bigger ones.In West   
 Taphouse alone there were three farms:
{West Taphouse Farm,Cross Close Farm   
 and{Wayton Farm.}Now there are none.  
 The houses have been sold to private  
 individuals and the land taken over by
 other tenant farmers.                 
 Much machinery has taken over the jobs
 of people,for example,potato planters,
 hay balers and milking machines.      
 Milk churns have been replaced by bulk
 tankers.Tractors have replaced horses.
 Silage is new and artificial manure is
 now used.                             
 The farming is more intensified now,  
 more going under the plough.Small     
 fields are being enlarged and much of 
 the Downs land has been reclaimed.    
 Some crops are subsidised by the      
 Government.
