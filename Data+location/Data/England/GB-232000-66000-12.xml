		<title>12A390 _ HISTORY</title>
		<content>      The A390 follows a{trading route 
 used since the Bronze Age, but the    
 modern road dates from{1763}when the  
{Callington Turnpike Trust}was set up. 
 By{1800}the surface of the road to St 
 Ive was improved using gravel and     
 stone, and{turnpikes}and{tollhouses   
 were set up.                          
     {Milestones}erected at this time  
 can still be seen along the road _ at 
 355689 is one marked{"4 1/3 furlongs  
{to Callington Market Gate",}while     
 Newbridge milestone shows 7 miles to  
 Liskeard. At the brow of the hill to  
 St Ive (334678) is the{"Take off"     
 stone, where the extra horse taken on 
 at Newbridge (to help coaches up the  
 steep climb) had to be unhitched.     
      The original{turnpike}ran up the 
 Cadson Farm road and to the west of   
 Pencrebar, but toll money was used to 
 cut the present routes in {1874.}     </content>
