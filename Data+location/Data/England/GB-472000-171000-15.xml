		<title>15RAMADAN IN READING</title>
		<content>    I am Rukhsana Ali.  My family comes
 from Pakistan. I have been to visit   
 Pakistan. Now I am in Reading I feel  
 much better at this time of year      
 because at midnight we get up because 
 it is Ramadan.  At 2 o'clock in the   
 night we have something to eat and we 
 go back to bed.  When we get up in the
 morning we do not have breakfast or   
 dinner or tea. We are not allowed to  
 even have sip of water or a crumb of  
 cake.                                 
   At night when we begin to have our  
 dinner we must have one or two dates. 
 Even if you don't have it at the      
 begining you must have one at the end.
   It is fun fasting because everybody 
 does it in our family.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
