		<title>13LANDSCAPE OF CURY/GUNWALLOE</title>
		<content>     During the Mid Devonian period of 
 rock building (350-400 million years  
 ago) the area was submerged beneath   
 the seas. Much sedimentation took     
 place laying down the Gramscatho and  
 Mylor Beds consisting mainly of slate.
 From such slate has the present land  
 scape formed resulting in an expanse  
 of quite fertile undulating grassland 
 intersected by a relatively steep     
 valley system with sharp breaks of    
 slope; caused by spring fed streams   
 and river. The valleys being more     
 densely foliaged. At the lower reaches
 the river has formed a marshy flood   
 plain and is banked by windblown sand 
 hills. The general height of the      
 undulating landscape ranges from 50'- 
 70' above sea level. The coastline    
 comprises of cliffs (e.g. Halzephron  
 Cliff) rocky/sandy coves and pebbly   
 beach/bar from Gunwalloe to Loe Bar.  </content>
