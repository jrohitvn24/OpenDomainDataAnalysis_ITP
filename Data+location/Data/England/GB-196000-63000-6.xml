		<content> In the streams around St Wenn you can 
 find frogs,toads and fish.The{common  
{frogs}live in still water and lays its
 eggs near water weeds.The{toads}are   
 common toads but we have not seen     
 natterjack toads. The toads like to   
 stay under stones.They fascinate us.  
  The fishes are{trout, salmon and     
{stickle backs.}The rivers are not well
 fished and there are not many anglers.
  On the river banks you can sometimes 
 find{heron, water rats and insects.   
{Pond skaters}and{great diving beetle  
 are frequently seen in the summer.    
   The rivers are fast flowing and in  
 winter rarely freeze over.The ponds   
 and river sides sometimes freeze. Then
 the creatures hibernate, notably      
 the newts,frogs and toads.The mild    
 winters mean many visisting birds and 
 animals can be found near streams     
 seeking food or water.                </content>
