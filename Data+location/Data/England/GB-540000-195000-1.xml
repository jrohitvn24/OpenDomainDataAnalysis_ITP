		<content>   Loughton is split into two parts.   
 The west side is mainly forest and the
 east is residential. In the{forest}is 
 Loughton Camp where Boudicea is said  
 to have hidden from the Romans.       
 Connaught waters is the largest       
 expanse of water in our area.There are
 quite a few rides, which are paths    
 through forest to help it breathe.    
   Next comes the{residential}part     
 where there is a Railway station with 
 frequent trains to and from London.   
 There is  a Bus station and the       
 Motorway M11 running through the S.E. 
 of our grid.The High road is where the
 big shopping area is and practically  
 everything is built around it. Because
 of the large residential part there   
 are many schools, but because of      
 falling roles one of them is going to 
 have to close.                        
                                       </content>
