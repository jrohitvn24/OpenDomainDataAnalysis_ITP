		<title>14Burford Dragon Procession</title>
		<content>The Dragon Procession took place on the
23rd June,in the early evening moving  
down the hill.Headed by a police car,  
the procession was followed by a group 
of Morris Men who came dancing down the
street in their largeÂ£horse'weaving    
in and out amongst themselves and the  
spectators,causing much hilarity.Behind
the Dancers was the dragon with a large
gaudily painted and ferocious looking  
face and its body about 30'long.The    
body was made of brightly coloured     
material fixed over large hoops forming
a tunnel,inside of which,numerous      
children provided mobility.The         
procession moved down the Hill,down    
Church Lane and into the Church Green, 
where everyone congregated.Revd.Moody  
said a St.John's Day collect,gave a    
blessing and a hymn was sung.Morris    
dancing followed.The only break from   
tradition,was no Giant or Mummers.     </content>
