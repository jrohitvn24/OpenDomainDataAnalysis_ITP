		<title>11A day in the life of ....</title>
		<content>   I get up between 7:55am and 8:00am,I
 don't want to get put of my cosy bed  
 in the morning but as I go downstairs 
 that feeling disappears.I have my     
 breakfast,Weetabix and toast,by       
 8:20am.I hate the rush before         
 school.We always seem to be late,     
 however early we are.I walk of to     
 school at about 8:47am and reach there
 at about 8:55am.The whistle goes at   
 9:00am.When we get into the class we  
 often do english untl assembly at     
 10:05am.At 10:30 we have first play   
 which lasts twenty minutes.Then we go 
 into our mathematics groups and work  
 from S.M.P.G. until 11:58am.After we  
 have our lunch(I have School dinners  
 but most people have sandwiches)we    
 have "dinner"play which lasts until   
 1:15pm.I like lunch but I have mixed  
 feelings on dinner play which can be  
 tiresome.                             </content>
