rural Staffordshire and the industrial 
West Midlands.It consists of a slope   
descending from east to west cut by a  
ridge running N/S, peaking at Bushbury 
Hill.There's an easily definable border
between urban/rural land use.Industry's
concentrated on the southern edge.The  
area has a dense road network of major 
and minor roads.A railway &amp; canal also 
move through the area.Change has been  
immense in the past 35 years,composed  
mainly of expansion of the suburbs of  
Wolverhampton into former farmland and 
the enveloping of the large village of 
Wednesfield. The area is well provided 
with schools and local shopping centres
of varying thresholds. There is also a 
hospital,fire station &amp; police station.

overspill of the town of Wolverhampton 
into retreating farmland.              </content>
