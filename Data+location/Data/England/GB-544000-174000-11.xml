		<title>11Green Chain Walk</title>
		<content> The Green Chain Walk is a signposted  
 pathway through south-east London and 
 North Kent,keeping to areas of        
 open-space,woodland,golf courses      
 etc.It was opened in June 1983 by the 
 deputy leader of the Greater London   
 Council,Mr.Iltyd Harrington.          
 In our block it passes though Oxleas  
 Wood,across Shooters Hill and then    
 through farmland near the WE ANCHOR IN
 HOPE pub.It then passes behind the    
 School in Hillview Drive-Westwood     
 school-and over Fanny-on-the-Hill.    
 The whole walk is about 15 miles long 
 from the River Thames to              
 Beckenham.There are many historically 
 interesting places outside our        
 block,like Sevendroog Castle,Eltham   
 Palace,and Monastery Ruins at Lessnes 
 Abbey Woods.
