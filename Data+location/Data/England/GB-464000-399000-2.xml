		<title>02Traffic flow in Auckley</title>
		<content> A lot of of traffic flows through     
 Auckley,on the main road,although     
 little actually stops.The traffic that
 originates from Auckley is mainly     
 commuting traffic.Most vehicles are   
 probably either coming from or going  
 to R.A.F.Finningley.                  
    In a census of the different types 
 of vehicles passing through Auckley,we
 found that:                           
{14% ESTATE CARS                       
{31% SALOON CARS  }On average 6     {  
{24% HATCH BACKS  }vehicles passed     
{3%  SPORTS CARS  }through Auckley     
{14% VANS         }every minute.       
{1%  TRACTORS                          
{13% LORRIES                           
{  }Over three quarters of the above   
 vehicles had male drivers.While most  
 had 2 passengers or less.Over half of 
 the vehicles were aged 6 years or     
 less.                                 </content>
