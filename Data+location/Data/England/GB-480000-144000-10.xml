		<title>10Pubs in West Farnham</title>
		<content> Farnham has always been well endowed  
 with pubs. In 1892 there were 93; in  
 1901 there was one pub for every 155  
 people.Today there are 12 pubs in our 
 D-Block. Among the best known are :   
{The Bricklayers Arms -}was originally 
 situated along Abbey Street,but has   
 been re-established along Weydon Lane.
{The Wheatsheaf-}is situated along West
 Street but it has been reconstructed  
 in recent years.For the last quarter  
 of the 18th century and much of the   
 19th century the pub was owned by     
 Knights Brewery.It was sold in        
 1888 to the Farnham Brewery.They      
 offered it for sale 3 years later,and 
 Reid's Brewery bought it in 1896.The  
 Wheatsheaf is the setting of a detail 
 in Michael Sadliers "Forlon Sunset".{ 
{The Plough-}is a timber and brick pub 
 existing in 1806 and reconstructed in 
 1933-34.It used to have a brewhouse.  </content>
