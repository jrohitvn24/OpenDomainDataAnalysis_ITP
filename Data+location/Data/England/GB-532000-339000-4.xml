		<title>04St. LEODEGARS CHURCH</title>
		<content>   In 1822 the church was in a sorry   
 state.The aisle was propped up because
 it was falling down.These repairs were
 finished in 1881.The three windows,   
 though, were boarded up, so in the    
 1970'sthe windows were re_glazed with 
 figures of saints.St Botolph, St      
 Hugh, St James and St Guthlac.These   
 were from St James' church which was  
 demolished in the early 1970's.       
   A new font was added to the         
 collection from a Norwich church in   
 1983.
