		<title>19CROPWELL BUTLER CONSERVATION</title>
		<content> The ecology of this village accords   
 with the mode of life of the inhabit- 
 ants. The arable fields are attractive
 at all times of the year, farm stock  
 is pleasant &amp; there are many fine     
 indigenous trees, particularly horse- 
 chestnut. Many new trees have been    
 planted by the Parish Council, &amp; in an
 effort to combine conservation &amp; wild 
 life preservation with commercial     
 farming, one large land owner has     
 planted many thousands of trees, built
 a lake for both irrigation &amp; environ- 
 mental purposes &amp; returned land to    
 grass from cereals. The grave-yard at 
 Tithby is particularly attractive in  
 Spring when drifts of snowdrops are   
 visible under the oak trees. Footpaths
 are well maintained due to the        
 vigilance of the Parish Council. At   
 Butler there is discussion about the  
 establishment of a conservation area. </content>
