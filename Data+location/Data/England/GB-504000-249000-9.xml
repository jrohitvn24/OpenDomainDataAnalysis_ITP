		<title>09NEWNHAM POOL PLANS</title>
		<content> On Sunday 7th July 1985 the{          
{"Bedfordshire on Sunday"}brought out  
 the plans of what Sainsburys,one of   
 the biggest shopping chains in England
 would like to do with Newnham swimming
 pool and the area around it. The plans
 were published just 24 hours before   
 the council had to make their final   
 decision to demolish the pool. What   
 Sainsburys intend to do is build a    
 Homebase near the pool, which would   
 sell DIY and garden items. With the   
 Homebase would come more parking space
 and a nice garden area. In the garden 
 would be a nice big greenhouse. If    
 they do up the pool it will mean      
 lowering and deepening the whole      
 thing. The pool will provide paddling 
 on an artificial beach and a solarium.
 Also at the pool they are going to    
 have a disco room and a family        
 restaurant.                           </content>
