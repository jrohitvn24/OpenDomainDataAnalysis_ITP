		<content> The pub was built in the 17th century.
 Originally it was a private dwelling: 
 then a coaching inn and finally       
 converted to a pub earlier this       
 century.  Since then it has had       
 several owners.  The present owners   
 are Mr and Mrs Whiteley.  They took   
 over in November 1984.  The pub       
 employs a part-time cleaner.          
 About 80-90 customers visit the pub   
 every day and they serve about 20     
 lunches.  2 deliveries of food are    
 made each week.  There is a lounge, a 
 bar and a games room.  In the games   
 room there is a pool table, a dart    
 board and slot machine games.
