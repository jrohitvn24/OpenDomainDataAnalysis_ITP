		<title>20GOVERNMENT/PLANS-HEADCORN.</title>
		<content> In 1984 the{Maidstone Borough Council 
 published a "Consultation Draft" of a 
{Village Plan}for{Headcorn,}so that the
 residents could study and comment on  
 the proposed improvements for the     
 Village. Only the extreme{S-W.corner} 
 of this block comes within the built- 
 up boundary of this plan, but any     
 alterations in the Village environment
 affects the whole Parish, so very keen
 interest was aroused. A revised Plan  
 is to be issued in 1985,when the views
 of all concerned have been discussed.
