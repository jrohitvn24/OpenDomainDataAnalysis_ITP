		<title>15S. Concerns in Stallingboro'</title>
		<content> Services available for the elderly in 
 the village include the following:    
 Meals on Wheels: these are brought by 
 volunteer drivers from a centre three 
 miles away and are available one per  
 week. A social services bus takes     
 elderly housebound people to a day    
 centre at Immingham one afternoon a   
 week. A mobile chiropody unit comes to
 the village once per month. The       
 Council's village plan proposes to    
 develop the village considerably,     
 doubling the present population.      
 Recent developments have provided for 
 the elderly and the newly married. It 
 is felt that family houses are needed,
 to encourage growing families to stay 
 in the village, to give stability and 
 encourage a good community spirit.    
 There is also concern that any growth 
 should be gradual, so that newcomers  
 integrate with the existing community.</content>
