		<title>06WILDLIFE IN BRANSTON</title>
		<content> Branston is a flat farming landscape, 
 so there are few places where         
 interesting wild plants grow. We do   
 get lots of wildlife in Branston      
 like:partridges, pheasant, ducks and  
 rabbits. We also get lots of predators
 like: foxes, weasels, sparrow hawks   
 and sometimes kestrels. However       
 farmers have changed the landscape by 
 chopping down hedges and trees to make
 bigger fields and draining fields to  
 make them very dry. As well as that   
 farmers are using crop-sprays and     
 poisons. Although these kill pests    
 they also kill less harmful animals   
 like rabbits and mice. Because this is
 happening plants and insects are being
 killed off, which affects bird life.  
 Now farmers are giving up land to     
 create reservoirs for water birds and 
 are planting shrubs and trees to      
 create new habitats.                  </content>
