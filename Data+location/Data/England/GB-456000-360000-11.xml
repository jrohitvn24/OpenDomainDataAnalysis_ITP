		<title>11FOREST TOWN</title>
		<content>      I think Forest Town is alright to
 live in. Most of the people are       
 friendly and there isn't much litter. 
 We have our own village shops, church,
 youth club, dancing hall and three    
 pubs. We have three schools.          
      Some men work at the pit. Forest 
 Town is very active in the mornings   
 but we don't have many fairs or       
 carnivals. But we have our problems   
 with our neighbours.                  
      Forest Town has a farm with about
 two hundred acres and two big ponds.  
 One is private and one is for leisure 
 fishing. In the middle of one of the  
 lakes is an island. Poachers are      
 always shooting things at the farm.   
      Most of Forest Town used to be   
 Sherwood Forest. There is still a bit 
 left but not much. Most of our rivers 
 run into the River Trent.
