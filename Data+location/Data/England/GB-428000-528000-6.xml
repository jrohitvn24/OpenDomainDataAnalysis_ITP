		<title>06Local housing types.</title>
		<content>   Two main types of housing are found 
 in our area.They are terraced houses  
 and semi-detached houses. As much of  
 the area is agricultural land there   
 are also a number of farm houses      
 scattered around.                     
    Many of the older terraced houses  
 were built in parallel rows to provide
 homes for the coal miners working in  
 the local pits around the turn of the 
 century. The pits no longer survive   
 but the houses do. (Our school is     
 located on the site of an old         
 colliery.) These terraced houses have 
 no gardens, only back yards, but there
 are allotments near to all old        
 terraced blocks.                      
    More recent (mid sixties and       
 onward) terraced houses, built by the 
 local council have a more informal    
 layout with individual gardens, greens
 and walkways.                         </content>
