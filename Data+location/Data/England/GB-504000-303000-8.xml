		<content> Pilsgate is a very small village.     
 It has an old estate and a new estate.
 The new estate is one half of         
 Pilsgate. The old part is called      
 Puddingbag lane.Across the main road  
 is a large farm house "Pilsgate       
 farm" belonging to Mr.Reynolds.He     
 farms much of the surrounding land. On
 the junction is a bus stop and a      
 telephone kiosk. Behind this is a     
 large grain store. Puddingbag lane has
 nine houses and two bungalows.The two 
 bungalows are for disabled people.    
 They have an alarm light over the     
 window in case there is an emergency. 
 The one I live in belongs to Burghley 
 and is probably less than twenty years
 old.At the bottom there is a dead end 
 and you can see most of Barnack across
 a steeply sloping hill.
