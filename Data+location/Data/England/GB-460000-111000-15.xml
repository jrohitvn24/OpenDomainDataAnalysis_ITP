		<title>15PUBS IN THE NEWTOWN AREA</title>
		<content> There are 3 public houses in the grid 
 area but there have been others. The  
 Traveller's Rest remains an unspoilt  
 traditional pub, for nearly 50 years  
 from 1880 the publican was a member of
 the Crook family, well known locally. 
 Used by 'locals' it has a darts team  
 and sells colds snacks for travellers.
 Quite the opposite is The Chairmakers 
 which attracts people from a wide area
 to its restaurant,providing facilities
 for young families. The Horse &amp; Jockey
 is a very old building, used both by  
 local people and visitors attracted to
 its traditional appearance. Has Darts,
 Chess and Shove Ha'penny Boards but no
 teams. Each pub has either a one-armed
 bandit or a Space Invader. The Plough 
 in Soberton Heath closed in the 1950s,
 and The Royal Oak was in Liberty Road 
 around the turn of the century, said  
 to have been visited by Queen Victoria</content>
