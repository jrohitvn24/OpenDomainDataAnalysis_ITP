		<title>17 MARTLESHAM CREEK</title>
		<content>                                       
Martlesham Creek is a muddy inlet of   
the River Deben. The River Fynn drains 
into the Creek. In the mud about twenty
small yachts are moored. They float for
one hour each side of high tide.       
 You can walk all round the creek and  
watch the shelducks searching for food 
and the moorhens in the reeds.Living on
the reeds are lots of snails, perhaps  
they like the moist atmosphere.Reeds   
are used for thatching. Only 500m.     
from the creek there is an old {Suffolk
Pink} house thatched with them.        
 Nearby is the Martlesham Sewage Works.
There are four big cleansing tanks, to 
our surprise there was no bad smell!   
 We could smell the pigs from the      
piggeries. 1000 sows produce up to 20  
piglets each year which are sold at    
local markets for meat.
