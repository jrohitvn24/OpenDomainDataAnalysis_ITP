		<title>12SARAH'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 8 o'clock and put on my   
 school clothes we are not forced  to  
 wear school uniform.The clothes I     
 usually wear are a blue pinifore      
 dress and a blouse and a knitted      
 pullover my grandma knits for me.I go 
 down stairs and get my breakfast I    
 have cornflakes and a drink of tea    
 after that I put my spelling book     
 in my blue shoulder bag say goodbye to
 my mam kiss,my cat and kitten and go  
 to school which is only  400  metres  
 away.At school we start with assembly,
 after that we have Maths or English.I 
 like school because I meet all my     
 friends, my best friend is Suzanne we 
 are always laughing and giggling.
