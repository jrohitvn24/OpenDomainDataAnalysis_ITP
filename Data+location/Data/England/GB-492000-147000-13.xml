		<title>13RECREATION IN PUTTENHAM</title>
		<content> There is an eighteen hole{golf course 
 on Puttenham Heath. The club was      
 founded in 1894 and has grown         
 steadily. A new club house was built  
 in 1984.                              
                                       
 Just below Frosbury hill, where Queen 
 Victoria stood in 1858 to review her  
 troops, and also on the heath, there  
 is a{cricket club.                    
                                       
 The{bowls club }have a green nearby   
 and are sometimes in danger from      
 golfers who slice their drives  off   
 the first tee.                        
                                       
 The{Puttenham football club}run two   
 teams which play on the Recreation    
 ground in the village, and in 1985    
 they are raising money to build a new 
 pavilion.                             
                                       </content>
