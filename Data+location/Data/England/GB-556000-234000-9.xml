		<content>  On 11th May some of the children went
 to{Pwllheli}in North Wales for an     
 activity week. We shared chalets for  
 our rooms. We spent 6 days in the     
 holiday camp. During this time we went
 to castles, slate mines and a rabbit  
 ranch where we could handle the       
 rabbits and feed the lambs. We also   
 took part in a number of activities.  
 They were; absailing, archery,        
 badminton, boating, fencing, judo,    
 gymnastics, team games and table      
 tennis. We had our meals in a very    
 large dining hall; we had breakfast,  
 lunch and dinner. In the evenings we  
 could choose between disco, swimming, 
 television or a film. We could have   
 soup at 8.30.p.m. We had a meeting    
 before bed to go through what we had  
 done and to hear about the next day.  
 Then we went to bed at 10 p.m.
