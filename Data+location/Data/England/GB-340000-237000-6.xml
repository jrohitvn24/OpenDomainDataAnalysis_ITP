		<title>06MADLEY EARTH STATION Pt2</title>
		<content> Madley was the second earth station to
 be built, it was needed to provide    
 diversity and to meet the rapid growth
 in international calls. It took 3     
 years before a suitable site was      
 found. Madley  was an 'electrically   
 quiet' area, free from other radio    
 interference and the ground was stable
 enough to carry aerials and buildings 
 and  large enough to allow future     
 growth. The Station also had to be as 
 close to London as possible because   
 most international calls originate or 
 pass through the capital.             
   Areas served are the Middle East,   
 Africa, the Far East, Australasia, the
 Indian sub-continent, Europe and North
 America.
