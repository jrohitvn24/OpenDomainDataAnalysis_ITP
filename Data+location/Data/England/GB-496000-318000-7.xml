		<title>07THE CASTLE AT CASTLE BYTHAM.</title>
		<content> The drawbridge and main entrance were 
 most likely approximately where the   
 new bridge is.  The area of flat      
 ground between the hill and the moat  
 was the 'Castle yard'.  This would be 
 where most of the business of the     
 castle (trading for food, weapons     
 etc)would be carried on; in times of  
 trouble cattle would be driven there  
 for protection, and people from the   
 surrounding countryside would take    
 refuge.  Defense was from the towers, 
 and slits in the walls, through which 
 defenders could drop or pour things   
 onto besiegers.  King Henry III (1216 
 - 1272) besieged and destroyed the    
 castle when he quarrelled with the    
 Albermarle family in 122O.  (The      
 Albermarles owned much of the village 
 including the church).  Henry gave the
 remains to a family called Colville,  
 who lived there until 137O.           </content>
