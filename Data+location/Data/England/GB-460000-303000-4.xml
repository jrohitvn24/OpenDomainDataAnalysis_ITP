		<content> The skyline is dominated by the       
 christian church spires. That of{St.  
{Saviour's Church}can be seen from     
 almost anywhere in our D-block.Temples
 and Mosques are not so obvious,they   
 are often in converted houses or      
 factories.{St.Barnabas Church}was     
 built in 1886, it cost Â£7000. There is
 a balcony where the servants used to  
 sit during services. The church       
 downstairs holds 60 people. On one of 
 the stained glass windows there is a  
 picture of a monk, this is the man who
 gave the window to the church. There  
 is a pulpit and a brass eagle forms   
 the lectern, people read on it. The   
 fire-proof safe contains the registers
 for weddings,christenings and         
 funerals.
