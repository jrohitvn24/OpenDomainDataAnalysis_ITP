		<content> Where I live is a nice quiet place    
 except when tractors come by and it is
 good for playing games at my house. I 
 have found some old coins and a solid 
 gold ring it was worth 17 pounds. We  
 are having a porch made on our back   
 door but we have had a swimming pool  
 built already. Our house is overfive  
 hundred years old. A long time ago it 
 was two cottages together we know that
 because it has got 14OO on one side   
 and 1636 on the other. We are buying  
 some land off the farmer and its got  
 two ponds in it. On the other side we 
 are buying a track which has got three
 barns and a piece of grass.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
