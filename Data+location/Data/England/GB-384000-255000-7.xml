 The{kingfisher}isn't very common but  
 is still there.Along the{canal}there  
 are a lot of water voles and rats and 
 just as common are fishermen.         
  If you walk around the fields when it
 is dark you will probably see a       
 bat.These bats keep flying around near
 lamposts to find moths or flying      
 insects.Around our area there is still
 a lot of wildlife to be seen.But at   
 this rate with some of our{wildlife}  
 either being shot or killed for sport 
 there will not be much left.So let's  
 preserve our{wildlife}and keep it that
 way so that everyone can see the      
 beautiful wildlife that is around our 
 area.
