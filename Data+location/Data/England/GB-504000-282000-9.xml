 When I was talking to Mrs. Marriott   
she said it was lovely to live on a    
farm, and that she had not lived       
on any other farm before she was       
married. She told us that they had 14  
fields and they were growing winter    
barley, wheat, oats and beans. She     
said they had got 48 sheep and 94      
lambs this year but they used to have  
pigs, cows and goats. They also have   
two dogs one called Pudding and the    
other Custard. The time Mrs. Marriott  
gets up is 7.00 a.m. and sometimes     
earlier. She is a member of the W.I.   
and enjoys taking part in the village  
pantomime group both as an actress and 
helping with back stage. Mrs. Marriott 
is one of the School Governors.
