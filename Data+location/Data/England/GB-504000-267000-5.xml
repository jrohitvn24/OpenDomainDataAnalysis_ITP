		<title>05Ecology in Dean</title>
		<content> The pattern of the area is one of     
 large fields and narrow curving lanes,
 emphasised in places by the hedges.   
 Trees and hedges are especiallt       
 prominent around Dean Church, Dean    
 House and the Grange in Upper Dean and
 alongside the brook in Lower Dean.    
 There are several important areas of  
 woodland, the 2 largest being at the  
 east side of Upper Dean and Spanoak   
 Wood about 0.5 mile to the east of    
 Upper Dean. All the woodland areas are
 mainly deciduous.                     
 Many of the elm trees have now been   
 felled but work is progressing in     
 several areas with the planting of new
 trees. Dean was one of the last areas 
 in the county to be affected by Dutch 
 Elm disease.
