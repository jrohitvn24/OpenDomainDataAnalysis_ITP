		<title>09THE DAYLIGHT INN, PETTS WOOD</title>
		<content>The {Daylight Inn} was built in 1935   
and named after the ideas of {William  
Willett} who fought the campaign for   
{daylight saving}. It is built in Tudor
style with lattice windows and white   
walls. The {inn sign} explains daylight
saving. There is a picture of the sun  
and at either side there is a clock.   
One of the clocks says twelve o'clock  
and the other says one o'clock. There  
are two arrows near the edge to show   
that in spring the clocks are put      
forward and in autumn the clocks are   
put back.                              
Inside the inn there are thirteen      
bedrooms, a hall where banquets and    
dancing are held, and a stage where    
amateur plays can be performed.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
