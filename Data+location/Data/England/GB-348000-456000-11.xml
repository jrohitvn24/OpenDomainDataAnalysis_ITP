		<content> The university lays on a varied       
 musical programme in the Great Hall   
 from classical music to pop groups.   
 You can even attend lunch time        
 concerts in term time. There is a Fine
 Art Department in the university which
 exhibits some of the students' work in
 the Scott Gallery. The exhibition     
 provides a fascinating glimpse of the 
 development of individual ideas and   
 skill over the three year visual arts 
 degree. Students studying for the     
 degree may choose from four main      
 areas; painting, sculpture, graphic   
 and product design. The Nuffield      
 Theatre has a variety of the best of  
 dance, drama, mime, jazz and cabaret. 
 The theatre studio is at the north end
 of the campus next to the Great Hall. 
 The students have many clubs such as  
 poetry reading, Gilbert and Sullivan, 
 Music Society, TV and review groups.  </content>
