		<title>10CAUSES FOR CONCERN IN DUFTON</title>
		<content> Some topics always lead to discussion.
 At present the proposal that this area
 be an AONB is one.The supporters of   
 the idea are mainly conservationists, 
 some among our visitors.But some farm-
 ers &amp; other locals fear it would lead 
 to greater difficulties with planning 
 etc.They do not see it bringing more  
 jobs to the area,followed by income,  
 which is needed.We are close to the   
 Lake District National Park where some
 locals are unhappy.Some feel we don't 
 want more tourists &amp; that the farming 
 has kept this area in its natural     
 beauty.Another topic is the provision 
 of amenities especially for tourists, 
 toilets,bus parks etc.To some,the lack
 of these is a nuisance,but no-one can 
 contemplate them being put in the     
 village centre.Village depopulation   
 worries people as it leads in turn to 
 loss of services, schools &amp; more.     </content>
