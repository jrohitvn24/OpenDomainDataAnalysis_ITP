 Most of the area in this D_block is in
 the parish of Hawley in Hart District,
 Hampshire. In 1981 the parish had a   
 population of 7,781. Much of the land 
 of the D_block is heaths, commons, and
 woods. Large areas are used for army  
 training.                             
      The D_block lies on the edge of  
 Farnborough and Fleet. Both places    
 have seen their populations grow      
 rapidly in recent years. Some new     
 building associated with the expansion
 of these towns will take place inside 
 the D_block in the near future. It    
 seems likely however that it will     
 retain its rural character for the    
 foreseeable future.
