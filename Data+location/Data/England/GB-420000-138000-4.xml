{Mr Smith }the owner of the garage. He 
 works for about 82 hours a week. He   
 has got 7 staff on the job .To work in
 his garage you would need about 3 to 5
 years training. Last year he had 1    
 tanker every 8 days.{Mr Smith}is very 
 friendly. This is the only garage in  
 this block .{Sarah}and{Sharon} sat in
