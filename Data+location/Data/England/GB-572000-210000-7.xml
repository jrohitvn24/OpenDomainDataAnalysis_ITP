 acres,and this is cut for hay, much of
 which is sold to the riding school.   
 The remainder is devoted to crops.

 acres Winter Barley on 11 and Summer

 and New Hall was supplied with milk.  
 Now calves are bought in at 1 week old
 to rear for beef. They are sold at 12

 rearing them on grass.
