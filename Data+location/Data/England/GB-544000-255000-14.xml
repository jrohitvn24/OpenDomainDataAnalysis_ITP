		<title>14My Pets</title>
		<content>    My sister and I both own a white   
 mouse. We keep them in large cages    
 which have to be cleaned out regularly
 otherwise there is a nasty smell. We  
 use sawdust and newspaper for the     
 bottom of the cage and warm fluffy    
 cotton-wool for their bed.            
    Other people own cats,dogs,hamsters
 gerbils,tortoises or goldfish. Small  
 pets are more suitable for a town be- 
 cause they don't need a great deal of 
 exercise or acres of grass to eat like
 a horse. My grandma has a cat because 
 she likes to talk to it when she is   
 alone. Some old people who live alone 
 in the area have a dog who will bark  
 when people come to the door,but dogs 
 should be walked several times a day  
 and  not all old people can manage    
 to take them to the parks.            
    Small birds like budgerigars are   
 also kept for companionship.          </content>
