 of the houses are built for           
 commuters.An average of 75% of the    
 adults are commuters.White Post Fields
 has just been built.The man who is    
 financing in the building of the      
 houses is Mr Ellis.His family have    
 owned the land for many               
 generations.Numerous developers are   
 arguing about building on farmland,as 
 it is a green belt area.The only other
 built up area is High Wych and the    
 rest of the land is                   
 farmland. Many houses are detached    
 or semi detached three bedroomed.They 
 have a garage and two gardens.There is
 a living room,dining room,bathroom and
 kitchen.
