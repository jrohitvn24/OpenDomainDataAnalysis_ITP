		<content> Tourists seem to like to come to our  
 part of the country in the summer     
 which makes it hard for us to get from
 one place to another as we live in a  
 rural area. There is also a lot of    
 beaches which are crammed packed      
 with people. If you wanted to go to   
 Barnstaple in the summer there is     
 always a queue on the mainroad. We    
 have holiday camps at Ruda ,          
 Putsborough and Croyde Bay.           
 A lot of people in the summer have    
 Bed &amp; Breakfast and then many of the  
 hotels start to get packed with       
 tourists. In Georgeham there are two  
 pubs ,the Rock Inn is the one that    
 tourists go to and the Kings Arms     
 locals mostly go to. Favourite        
 tourist spots are Putsborough ,       
 Saunton and Croyde Beaches.
