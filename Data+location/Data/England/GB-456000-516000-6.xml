 This area is all{scrubland,}heather   
 and bracken. Along the boundry of this
 area was an old{dry stone wall.}It is 
 quite a flat area.In some parts the   
 land is very{boggy and marshy.}It is  
 quiet on the moors.We noticed that the
 grass was very springy and looked     
 thinner and lighter than usual.It felt
 quite slippy too.There were many      
 bushes like{gorse}and{bramble.}Among  
 the heather, there were shallow dips  
 in the ground. This is probably caused
 by the land subsiding due to the      
 mining which was underneath. In this  
 area there is a pond called{Carr Pond.
 It was quite muddy but there were some
 tadpoles in it.The land near to the   
 pond was marshy.
