 Mr.Watts who owns Hope Farm on the    
 edge of Buckhorn Weston village. He   
 was extremely helpful and gave all the
 following information:-               
   Size of farm     200 acres          
   Number of cattle 115 milking cows   
   Breed of cattle  Friesian mostly    
   Farm History:-                      
          There has been a farm on this
 site for 400 years. Mr Watts has lived
 there for 23 years. There used to be  
 several cottages and another farmhouse
 on the land but these have now been   
 demolished and quite a lot of         
 modernisation has taken place. He runs
 two Ford tractors and one Leyland and 
 makes silage from his own grass to    
 provide food for the cattle, in the   
 Winter. Mr Watts attends Sturminster  
 Newton market, usually each week to   
 buy and sell heifers.                 </content>
