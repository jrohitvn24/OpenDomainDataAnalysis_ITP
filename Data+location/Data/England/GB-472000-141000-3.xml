 Upper Froyle is in a{conservation area
 which means that it cannot be altered 
 very much without special planning    
 permission through the East Hants     
 District Council at Petersfield.  If  
 trees die they must be replanted but  
 the others may not be cut down unless 
 they are dangerous.  Although the land
 has been widely farmed for centuries, 
 some natural woodland and downland    
 remains.  There are fewer wild flowers
 now than were recorded by the WI for  
 their Scrapbook in 1952. {The wild    
{tulip grew in Froyle}but it became    
 rare and disappeared with the making  
 of the dual carriageway.{ Nightingales
{still sing in the woods.} Our school  
 has planted an evergreen oak, maple,  
 silver birch and hawthorn trees in the
 school grounds in recent years.
