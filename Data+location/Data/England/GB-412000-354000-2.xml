		<title>02Ecology around Alstonefield</title>
		<content>     I live in Alstonefield and I've   
seen people destroying trees, but the  
Dutch Elm Beetle seems to have killed a
lot more than man has, and there aren't
any more being planted to replace them.
     Lots of wild flowers are being    
picked by children and being killed by 
harmful sprays.  Hedges are being      
ripped up to make bigger fields.  They 
then can bring in bigger machines which
kill field mice and very rare flowers  
which only grow in crop fields.        
     The grouse and pheasant are being 
killed by farmers with guns and by     
shooting parties.                      
     Rabbits still thrive in the fields
even though some get killed by traffic,
or by people, they are still not an    
endangered species.                    
     The villagers do care about nature
-all the gardens are clean and there   
are places for all types of creatures. </content>
