		<title>12SHOPPING</title>
		<content> The two main areas for shopping in    
{Catterick Garrison}are Shute Road and 
 a row of shops in Hilyard Row known as
 the{White Shops.}Shute Road has a     
 Naafi  while the{White Shops}have a   
 Spar supermarket. Both areas have a   
 newsagent and a Chinese take-away.The 
 shops tend to change quite often      
 because of the high rents.At the{White
{Shops}the Chemist shop has been there 
 for over 30 years while the Butcher   
 has been there only a month.The main  
 Post Office and two banks are in      
 Richmond Road close to Shute Road.    
 There are two other small Naafi's ,one
 in Horne Road and one in Loos Road.   
{Scotton Village}has its own small     
 supermarket and a local shop with a   
 sub-post office.Most people do their  
 main shopping in Richmond and         
 Darlington.
