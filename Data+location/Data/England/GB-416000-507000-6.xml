		<content>  The{game of QUOITS}has been played in
 this  area for  longer than anyone can
 remember.  It was at its  most popular
 as  a{village pastime}in the {1920's &amp;
{30's }but then seems to have gone into
 decline.  In the {mid-1970's}it{made a
{comeback }when some  30 local villages
 formed the{ Zetland Quoits League} and
 when  the  game  began  to  be  played
 competitively in two organised leagues
 called the  'A'&amp;'B' divisions.  As its
 popularity grew,  a third 'C' division
 was formed.                           
  In  addition  to {league  competition
 each   club   holds   its   own  {open
{competition} when individuals play the
 game for prizes and trophies. There is
 also  a  {'WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP',} which
 this year was  held in Northumberland.
 Some  members  even  travel  as far as
{North Wales}on occasions to play.     
{ Melsonby}is  amongst the {top  teams.</content>
