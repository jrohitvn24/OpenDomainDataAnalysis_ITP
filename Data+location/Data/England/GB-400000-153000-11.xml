{Company}in Market Lavington,sells and 
 services machinery like Land Rovers,  
 Tractors and Combine Harvesters.It    
 supplies farmers and other companies. 
 Twenty six people work there for eight
 and a half hours a day.It is very hard
 work,but they like their jobs.The most
 expensive thing they sell is a Combine
 Harvester.The cheapest item is a split
 pin which is sold for one penny.The   
 piece of garden equipment they sell   
 most is a lawn mower.Customers come   
 from up to forty miles away,but they  
 do not always buy something.The       
 busiest day is Monday and the busiest 
 time,between eight and half past nine 
 in the morning.
