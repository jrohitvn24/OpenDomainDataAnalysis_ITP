		<content> Dear Bournville Village Trust,        
 I am writing to thank you for giving  
 us your time to talk to us about the  
 land around Weatheroak Hill.I didn    
 know that the{Bournville VillageTrust}
 owned so much land around Wythall     
 and Weatheroak Hill.Thank you for the 
 copies of the photographs and of the  
 maps.The information you have given us
 will be very helpful in our Domesday  
 Survey.Yours sincerely.{David R.}     
 When we were surveying the farms in   
 our D-Block, we discovered that most  
 of the farmers rent their land from   
 the B.V.T. who bought it in the 1930's
 to preserve the {Green Belt} area     
 around Birmingham.Weatheroak Hall     
 hasn't changed and is now used as a   
 Golf Club.{Silvermead                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
