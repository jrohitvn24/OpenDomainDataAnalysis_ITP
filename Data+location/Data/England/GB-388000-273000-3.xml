		<content> There are still many half timbered    
 houses remaining in Chaddesley Corbett
 bordering what is believed to be an   
 old Roman Road. The original wattle   
 and daub has been replaced by brick   
 in-filling and many timbers have been 
 replaced by brick and painted over to 
 disguise this fact. Many houses       
 were destroyed by fire in the 17th    
 century and rebuilt but the plots of  
 land remain virtually the same.       
 There are several Georgian Houses     
 which includes a School House built in
 1785 and a village Workhouse built in 
 1795. There are Charity Houses built  
 in 1812 and an old schoolhouse built  
 in 1809. Another school was built in  
 1848 and has been converted into flats
 and a Doctor's Surgery. The present   
 school building was built in 1894 and 
 extended in 1963. There are several   
 Victorian Houses in the village.      </content>
