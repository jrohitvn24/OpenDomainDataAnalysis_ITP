		<title>15HOUSING STYLES</title>
		<content>    There are many differnt housing    
 styles in the local area. Each style  
 tells us a lot about different periods
 of our recent past.                   
   The earliest building in Balderton  
 is, of course, the village church     
 which has been on this site since     
 Saxon times. Many houses on Main      
 Street are substantial Georgian       
 and Victorian houses.                 
   As you move away from this street   
 the houses become more modern, with   
 large post-war estates surrounding the
 older original centre. Stone has been 
 replaced by houses made from clay     
 bricks. These are mainly semi-detached
 with small private gardens and        
 garages.                              
   A new trend has been for builders to
 pay more attention to the landscaping 
 of areas around the houses such as the
 Barratt estate.                       </content>
