		<title>19The Farmer's day in Summer 2</title>
		<content>  The milk is always fresh because it  
 is never touched by human hands.      
  In summer a cow pellet has 14%       
 protein but in winter a pellet has    
 18%protein.It takes an hour to milk 40
 cows.After I have milked all the cows 
 I put all the milk into the big       
 storage tank.After this I have to     
 clean the whole parlour it takes about
 ninety minutes.The parlour has to be  
 washed after every milking.           
  The worst things of a farmers day    
 comes next.I have to clean out the    
 yard because in Winter the cows are   
 kept in the yard.It takes about 2     
 hours then I go and have a rest.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
