		<title>03DISTRICT COUNCIL CHAMBER</title>
		<content>  The District  Council offices are in 
 Elmodesham House, a Georgian building 
 in Amersham High St,which was once a  
 Non-Conformist boarding school called 
 Ebenezer West Academy.It is a lovely  
 building-but the council need more    
 room and are building new offices in  
 Amersham-on-the-hill.                 
 Chiltern is one of the five district  
 Councils in Bucks: All 50 councillors 
 meet in the council chamber every 6   
 weeks.They are all elected and  not   
 paid a salary, but can claim expenses.
 Mrs. Stone (from Planning) had already
 told us about the work of the council,
 and she introduced us to the chairman,
 councillor Cresswell. He wore his     
 chain of office with the crest and the
 motto"Freely we serve."               
 Everything they discuss in a council  
 meeting is recorded in a "minute book"
 and signed by the chairman.           </content>
