		<content>    Felixstowe is a famous  seaside    
 town on the East coast and it has a   
 lot of day trippers during the        
 summer.A large proportion of          
 Felixstowe is taken up by the docks.  
 Felixstowe has a population of about  
 22,500 and many other people are      
 coming to live there because of the   
 expanding docks.There are a lot of new
 buildings being built,including The   
 Great Eastern Square,the new swimming 
 pool and the Cavendish Park estate    
 near to the docks.Retired people often
 come to Felixstowe as it is a quiet   
 seaside town.
