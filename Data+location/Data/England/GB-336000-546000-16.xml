   The{Main Lawn }is the old courtyard,
 and beneath this lawn are the old     
 cellars which have been closed off for
 about a hundred years. The Bishop has 
 tried and failed to enter these       
 cellars; he intends to try again from 
 the side. There is rumoured to be a   
 passage from Rose to Lime House and   
 the Bishop hopes to find this when he 
 enters the cellars.                   
   The church owns six acres of land   
 around the Rose on which the Bishop   
 keeps a small flock of sheep. He also 
 owns two dogs.                        
   The Bishop has a gardener and a     
 chauffeur who work for him. Their     
 wives, along with the Bishop's wife,  
 look after the housework in the Rose.
