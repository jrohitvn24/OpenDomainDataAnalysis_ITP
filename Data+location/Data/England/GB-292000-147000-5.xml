		<content> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INTERESTING AND 
 UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT NORTH HILL.  IT IS
 PART OF THE EXMOOR NATIONAL PARK AND  
 HAS AN IMPORTANT PART TO PLAY IN THE  
 NEED TO PRESERVE WILDLIFE.  ALTHOUGH  
 THE HILL IS FARMED, THERE ARE MANY    
 PARTS WHICH ARE WILD MOORLAND.  THESE 
 ARE DOMINATED BY HEATHERS, BILBERRY   
 AND GRASSES.  GORSE HAS BECOME        
 DOMINANT IN PARTS DUE TO THE LACK OF  
 PROPER MANAGEMENT.  YEARS AGO, GORSE  
 WAS BURNED REGULARLY IN ORDER TO ALLOW
 THE SHEEP TO GRAZE THE YOUNG SHOOTS.  
 TODAY THIS IS NOT SO NECESSARY AND THE
 FARMERS DON'T BURN THE GORSE          
 REGULARLY.  DEER ARE FAMOUS ON EXMOOR 
 AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION.  THE RED    
 DEER IS COMMON ON THE UPLAND AREAS BUT
 DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF TOURISM ONE    
 DOESN'T SEE THEM VERY OFTEN.          
                                       
                                       </content>
