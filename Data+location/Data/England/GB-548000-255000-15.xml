		<title>15The Folk Festival</title>
		<content> The Folk Festival has been going for  
 21 years.It was the council that      
 started it,because they thought it was
 a good idea.The same man has          
 orgainized it all the time.Cherry     
 Hinton Hall is a very big place,so    
 they decided to have it there.Many    
 people attend each year.He chooses the
 groups by listening to their records  
 and talking to them.He pays 25        
 groups,and more just come along of    
 their own accord.Lots of campers come 
 over night to get a good place.He has 
 only ever had 6 complaints about the  
 noise and most people don't mind.They 
 clear up the rubbish before and after 
 the festival.It takes about 2         
 days.There has been no vandalism in   
 21 years.Most people park outside the 
 grounds.The total annual profit is    
 about Â£8000.
