		<content>             {SHOPPING                 
    A lot of people{don't}use the shops
 in the village because of lack of     
 choice,and what they do have is       
 higher{priced}so they shop elsewhere. 
    Some people like the shops in the  
 village because they are{close at     
{hand.}Some people shop locally        
 occasionally and use the{big stores.  
    Here are the percentages:          
{    76%}...{Shop elsewhere.           
{    15%}...{Shop in the village.      
{     9%}...{Use both facilities.      
                                       
                                       
         {    FARMING                  
    The vast majority of the land in   
 this area is farmland. Quite a lot of 
 it is rough grazing for cattle and    
 horses, but most is for cereal crops. 
    The crops generally grown here are 
{wheat, barley, peas,}and{rape.        </content>
