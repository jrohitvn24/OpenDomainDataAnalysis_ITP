		<title>18SCAYNES HILL GARAGE</title>
		<content> In 1921 Mr JJE LUCKENS opened a garage
 in a World War 1 army hut behind the  
 village Post Office on the South side 
 of the main road. In 1926 he built a  
 house in a field, on a pond, just to  
 the North of the road, together with  
 the new garage. JJEL bought the       
 freehold of SCAYNES HILL HOUSE from   
 Judge Grantham;the former tenant      
 of the field, a builder, had retired. 
 A Reading Room in the same field is   
 now the village hall. JJL later       
 employed one man and then two.On      
 retirement of JJEL the garage was sold
 to a Mr Tom Parkin,then to a Mr       
 Turner. Now it is called FIELDS,and   
 the owner is Mr John Ashby. They      
 sell petrol and are specialists in the
 fitment of tyres and exhaust systems; 
 the garage is well sited on a busy    
 road: the {A272}from Haywards Heath.
