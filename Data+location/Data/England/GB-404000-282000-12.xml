		<title>12SOCIAL CONCERNS.</title>
		<content> There is a very high concentration of 
{mentally ill}and{mentally handicapped 
 people in Moseley.Both groups need    
 support and a caring home.Hotels with 
 profit motives are unsuitable         
 housing.Closure of mental homes means 
 heavystress on communities.Care from  
 skilled staff is needed.The church    
 offers{rehabilitation}and amusement to
 both groups.Concern for the numbers of
 these people in the parish is real.It 
 is felt that saturation is            
 bad,dispersal,council provision and   
 help for families are vital.          
{ Litter}is a serious problem.Some say 
 that roadsweepers should be employed, 
 although there are disagreements as to
 how often they should come.Most people
 were aware of the Â£100 fine for       
 dropping litter and thought it should 
 be enforced, and that shop owners     
 should care for their own areas.      </content>
