		<title>08Changes in  the area</title>
		<content> Most changes have taken place in the  
 use of buildings in the area.Over the 
 past 10 years the residential area has
 doubled in size without a             
 corresponding increase in industry.In 
 fact local industry has declined.     
 One of the major local changes has    
 occured with the closure of{Silas     
{Dykes Glove Factory}.This building has
 also housed a print shop employing 15 
 local people.The factory is to be     
 redeveloped into luxury flats and both
 the gloving and printing firms will   
 move outside the area.                
 Another major change was the closure  
 of the 100 year old Church School in  
 1981.It now houses a{Video Library},a 
{Mail Order firm}for film memorabilia  
 and{an 8 track Recording Studio}all of
 them are doing very well and have been
 made most welcome in the village as a 
 sign of new investment here.          </content>
