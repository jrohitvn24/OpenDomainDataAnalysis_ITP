		<content>{Smallwood Lodge}is,a Tudor house in   
 the High street.                      
 It is a timber building with a large  
 stable surrounded by a{Victorian      
 ironwork fence.                       
 Previously it was privately owned by  
 Brooke Hecter Smallwood and the       
 building is named after him.          
 Today it is a thriving bookshop       
 selling mainly childrens paperbacks.  
 It has been rumoured that{supernatural
{happenings}take place.                
 The story goes that when the Lodge was
 a hotel a man came in for lodgings and
 died on the stool.Today he haunts the 
 place sitting on the same stool. The  
 present owner finds books scattered on
 the floor every morning and evening.  
 The Lodge has an unusual feature in   
 the{Victorian}window which looks blue 
 on the outside and yellow on the      
 inside.{                              </content>
