		<title>16NOTTINGHAM(ST.ANN'S) HOUSING</title>
		<content>     The{St.Ann's}area of{Nottingham}  
 has had a period of slum clearance    
 since the late 1960's.Many of the     
 Victorian terraced buildings have been
 demolished,to make way for modern     
 housing.A lot of the allotments that  
 were used in St.Ann's have been built 
 on.                                   
     In our area,there is a housing    
 estate,owned by Metropolitan.We pay   
 rent to the owners.The local housing  
 estates in St.Ann's are quite new.The 
 heating for some of the housing is    
 pumped to the houses from an          
 incinerator. The rubbish is burnt and 
 changed into heat.                    
      Some of the older houses still   
 exsist.Many are council houses , but  
 some have been bought from the        
 council.
