		<title>16       Village Shops</title>
		<content> From our survey of three village      
 shops we established that most        
 villagers would not like to see       
 the shops and post offices close,     
 especially pensioners and people      
 without their own transport.The farm  
 shop in our "D" block holds a good    
 stock of green-groceries, eggs and    
 poultry. Most village shops are used  
 only for emergency items and although 
 villagers do not want to see the shops
 close,they do not give them their     
 full support as they can purchase     
 their goods so much cheaper in the    
 supermarkets,and it is impossible     
 for the smaller shops to compete.     
 There was quite a lot of criticism    
 concerning the stock held by village  
 shops - would people ever be happy on 
 this subject? The shop at Wickham St. 
 Pauls is about to change hands.
