		<title>18Interview-Macalpine Crescent</title>
		<content>   A friendly old man of about 75 was  
 sitting in a red and yellow striped   
 deckchair.  He had a small            
 semi-detached bungalow in Macalpine   
 Crescent and it was about 26 years    
 old.  The roof had reddy-brown tiles  
 and the house was built of brick.  He 
 had a small garden with gate and fence
 made of wood.  His pet mongrel terrier
 was bouncing up and down the garden,  
 trying to get out.                    
   He said he had five children, all   
 married and gone away.  All lived     
 locally except one who lived in       
 Cornwall.                             
   He wore a pair of old trousers that 
 looked too big, a shirt and a yellow  
 cardigan.  He was mostly bald but the 
 grey hair he did have was neatly      
 combed back.  His shoes were brown and
 shone as if he was expecting us!
