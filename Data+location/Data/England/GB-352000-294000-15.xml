		<title>15DUTCH ELM DISEASE IN PLAISH</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
    Dutch Elm disease is a fungus      
 carried by bark beetles - Scolytidae. 
 The elm tree's habit of sending up    
 suckers from its roots has contributed
 to the spread of Dutch Elm disease,a  
 virulent strain,which was introduced  
 into this country in 1967 and spread  
 rapdily. This has devastated the      
 beautiful elms in Plaish and changed  
 the landscape of the hamlet.          
    In a wood, several trees may be    
 connected underground - all of them   
 starting out as suckers from one tree.
 When any one of the trees is infected 
 the disease travels throughout the    
 root system killing one tree after the
 other.
