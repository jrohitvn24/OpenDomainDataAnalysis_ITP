		<title>19Concerns &amp; Worries</title>
		<content> From interviews the following concerns
 &amp; worries emerged but it is difficult 
 to say how representative they are.   
 Effect of the development of Stansted 
 Airport; the standard of secondary    
 education in Stevenage; environmental 
 questions; the condition of the roads;
 need for more recreational facilities;
 better bus service; better parking    
 facilities; a village policeman. Some 
 felt the development of Stanstead,    
 could change the whole character of   
 our community with pressure for new   
 roads &amp; accommodation. This is linked 
 with concern about increasing urban   
 encroachment from Stevenage. There is 
 concern about the policy of the       
 district council in making Walkern 'a 
 dumping ground for surplus council    
 tenants'. A deeper fear is of         
 unemployment already happening as a   
 backlash from Stevenage.              </content>
