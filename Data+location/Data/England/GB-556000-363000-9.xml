		<title>09The Pier In Skegness</title>
		<content> The pier opened in 1881 as a tourist  
 attraction. In Queen Victoria's time  
 piers were very popular. The entrance 
 to the pier was replaced in 1937 and  
 again in 1971. In 1919 the ship named 
 'Europa' of Amsterdam had anchored    
 about a mile or so from the shore. In 
 a storm the skipper was warned by the 
 coxswain of the lifeboat who was      
 Matthew Grunnill, if he didn't drop   
 anchors the tide could carry him      
 through the pier. The Dutchman refused
 to drop more anchors and at 8 o'clock 
 ran stern first through the pier. In  
 1978 a storm divided the pier into    
 three parts and the theatre at the end
 is still isolated in the sea. The     
 pier's arcade is in the land end      
 section. Half way down the pier there 
 is a flight of steps leading up to the
 middle part of the arcade. Now there  
 are also snack bars on the pier.      </content>
