		<content> Four schools lie within the block.    
 They are Wimboldsley County Primary,  
 Cledford County Junior, Cledford      
 County Infant and Middlewich County   
 Infant. There are approximately 600 in
 these schools and they are aged from  
 5 to 11. Most older children go to    
 Middlewich County Comprehensive       
 School. Wimboldsley is an old village 
 school, drawing children from its     
 local as well as surrounding villages 
 with a few coming from Middlewich     
 town. The Cledford schools are modern 
 (less than 15 years old) serving a    
 developing area of Middlewich town.   
 Middlewich Infant School is a 5 year  
 old replacement for the former        
 Middlewich C.E. Infant School. When   
 aged 7 the children from this school  
 transfer to Middlewich County Junior  
 School which is on the same campus but
 not within the block.                 </content>
