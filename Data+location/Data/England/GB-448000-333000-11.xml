		<title>11LONG EATON. The Urban Area.</title>
		<content>  This area is diverse in many ways.   
 There is a variety of housing -       
 detached, semi-detached and terraced. 
 The houses are of a variety of ages,  
 mainly Victorian, Pre First World War 
 and Modern. Some of the houses are    
 privately owned and some rented. Some 
 of the Council housing is, now        
 privately owned.                      
  Most areas have easy access to Long  
 Eaton centre for a variety of         
 amenities. Small shopping areas exist 
 within the area studied. These vary   
 from shopping streets to small corner 
 shops. None of the area has           
 entertainment facilities other than   
 pubs, and there is little in the way  
 of safe playing facilities for        
 children.
