		<title>06FARMING CHANGES(NEWICK AREA)</title>
		<content> The thing that has brought about the  
 biggest change in local farming over  
 the last 30 years or so, has been the 
 introduction of large machinery. The  
 farm manager who talked to us, said   
 that in 1958, 48 men were employed to 
 farm the 2,500 acres that he managed. 
 Today, only 13 men are needed. Today, 
 it takes one man just two hours to    
 milk 140 cows by machine. Field sizes 
 have been greatly increased so that   
 large machines can be used in them    
 more economically. The barns that held
 about a dozen cows are no longer used.
 Two barns by the Church are being     
 renovated; one is now a very          
 attractive house and the other is to  
 become a Church Hall. The small farms 
 have been amalgamated to form more    
 profitable units, and the farmhouses  
 have become very desirable, private   
 residences.                           </content>
