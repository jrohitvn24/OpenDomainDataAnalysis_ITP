		<content> There are few leisure amenities in our
 area and those that do exist cater    
 mainly for sport.                     
 Most leisure activities are therefore 
 home-based with only a few local      
 people prepared to travel to the      
 larger towns to seek amenities.       
 Television is by far the most popular 
 leisure activity with almost all the  
 population watching for several hours 
 each evening.  The increasing         
 popularity of video recorders has     
 increased the numbers choosing home   
 entertainment and many local shops now
 offer a video film hiring service.    
 For the younger generation the area   
 has little to offer with only the     
 local public houses offering any      
 leisure amenities.  To find any wider 
 choice of entertainment they must     
 travel to Camborne or Penzance.
