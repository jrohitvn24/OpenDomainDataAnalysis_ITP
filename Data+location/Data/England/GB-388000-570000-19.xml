		<title>19HUMSHAUGH  HOPES AND FEARS</title>
		<content> FEAR OF{NUCLEAR WAR}IS THE MOST COMMON
 WORRY IN THE COMMUNITY, ALTHOUGH      
 COUPLED WITH THE HOPE THAT THE THREAT 
 MAY BE AVERTED AND THAT THE CHILDREN  
 (AND THEIR CHILDREN IN TURN) WILL GROW
 UP INTO A PEACEFUL WORLD WHERE THEY   
 CAN BE USEFULLY EMPLOYED.             
 WORK AND THE LACK OF IT ARE THE OTHER 
 RECURRING FEARS;{REDUNDANCY}IS A      
 CONSTANT DREAD, AND THE WORRIES OF    
 LONG DISTANCES TO BE TRAVELLED TO     
 WORK AND THE INSECURITY OF THE TIED   
 HOUSE, ARE MUCH IN MIND.              
 THERE IS ALSO ANXIETY ABOUT THE       
 CONTINUING INTEGRITY OF{FAMILIES;}THE 
 FEAR OF GROWN CHILDREN'S MARRIAGES    
 BREAKING UP IS PARALLELED BY THE FEAR 
 OF YOUNGER CHILDREN TURNING TO{DRUGS, 
 AND THERE IS A RECURRING BUT LESS     
 PRONOUNCED FEAR OF DEPENDENCE IN OLD  
 AGE - OF HAVING TO RELY ON WHAT FAMILY
 REMAINS.                              </content>
