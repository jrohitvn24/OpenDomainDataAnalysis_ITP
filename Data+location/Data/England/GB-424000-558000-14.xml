		<title>14SALTWELL PARK:A PUPILS VIEW</title>
		<content>    by Rebecca McNichol, Class 4Y,     
    {Low Fell Junior School,}Gateshead.
 Saltwell Park is near the centre of   
 Gateshead. It is a funny shaped park  
 with four main roads and lots of      
 houses around. It has a lot of green  
 grass and trees. It is a good pace for
 children. The facilities are good for 
 little children. There are tennis     
 courts, a little paddling pool and a  
 playground with swings. In the "big   
 park" concerts are held in the        
 bandstands and children can enjoy     
 horse rides. In the "little park"     
 there are animal attractions. Both    
 parts of the park contain beautiful   
 flowers and interesting wildlife is to
 found among the plants and trees. A   
 big attraction is the aeroplane       
 fuselage. All in all I think its a    
 great park.
