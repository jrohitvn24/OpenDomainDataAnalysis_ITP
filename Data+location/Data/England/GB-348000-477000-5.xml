		<content> The story goes that the stones were   
 dropped by the devil.                 
 He was building the Devils Bridge at  
 Kirkby Lonsdale using stone from      
 Witherslack Quarry.                   
    He could only carry three stones in
 his apron.                            
    St Micheal who lived in a cell in  
 Beetham churchyard  was disturbed     
 from his afternoon snooze by all this 
 flying.He shook his fist at the devil 
 and said some rather unholy  words for
   a man of the cloth.The devil was so 
 alarmed that he shot up into the air  
 causing his apron strings to break and
 his apron to drop.The stones fell into
 the nearby field.                     
       Some village boys saw what      
 happened and recounted the tale.
