		<title>05Around Tesco's, Hollington</title>
		<content> Before Tesco's was built the land was 
{fields and woodland.}It is now a      
 busy area.First,{roads}were built from
 Hastings and from the A21.After this  
 they started building{houses.}Nowthere
 are quite a lot of homes and they are 
 still building.In 5 years  the area   
 has changed completely. Soon they will
 build a pub next to Tesco's,and the   
 Council is talking about putting a    
 Post Office there.                    
 We made out a{questionnaire}and found 
 that:                                 
 1.More than half the shoppers lived in
 Hastings.                             
 2.1 out of 10 travelled more than 15  
 miles to get there.                   
 3.They nearly all came by car.        
 4.7 out of 10 said they used the      
 restaurant sometimes.                 
 5.4 out of 10 used the garage because 
 the petrol is  cheaper.               </content>
