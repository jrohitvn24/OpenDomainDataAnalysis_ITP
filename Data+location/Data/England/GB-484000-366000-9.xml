		<title>09A BIRD SURVEY OF EAGLE</title>
		<content>   Some time ago the upper juniors did 
 a bird survey covering the catchment  
 area of Eagle school.They spotted 73  
 different species.Experienced         
 ornithologists would have found a lot 
 more.                                 
   The children counted 10 species     
 which were summer visitors.There were 
 3 different kinds of warblers.They    
 were blackcap,sedge warblers and      
 willow warbler.There were 4 kinds of  
 waders .They were common sandpiper,   
 green sandpiper, snipe and redshank.  
 There were 4 kinds of owls.They were  
 the barn owl, tawny owl, long-eared   
 owl and little owl.                   
   Kestrels are still quite common.    
 Sparrowhawks are sometimes seen during
 migration times and during winter.    
 Buzzards have been seen at North      
 Scarle in the winter and early spring.
