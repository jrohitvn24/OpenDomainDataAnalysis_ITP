		<title>04The windmill on Predannack</title>
		<content> We went to see the windmill on        
 Predannack downs. It is a thirty foot 
 high tower built of huge serpentine   
 and elvan stone blocks.It was         
 described as old on a map dated       
 1695.Now the roof and floor of the    
 building have been destroyed by gales 
 and nobody knows if it ever had       
 sails.In the early nineteenth century 
 it was famous as the haunt of a gang  
 of smugglers and sheep stealers who   
 terrorised the area.Stolen animals    
 were hidden and killed there before   
 being sold or exchanged for smuggled  
 spirits and tobacco at Sheepstealers  
 Cave near Kynance Cove.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
