		<title>01The Religion of Islam</title>
		<content>  During the post war years many Asian 
 families have come to live in         
 Gillingham.                           
 This has resulted in the need for     
 schools to teach children with a multi
 cultural background.                  
 The dominant religion of the Asian    
 children is that of Islam.            
 Most of these children are not from   
 devout families. The families have no 
 objection to the children taking part 
 in the Christian religious education  
 provided in state schools.            
 However, many children still celebrate
 Islamic festivals.                    
 The following text outlines some of   
 the beliefs of this minority group.   
                                       
 The followers  of Islam are called    
 Muslims. We believe in Allah. The     
 leader is MOHAMMED.
