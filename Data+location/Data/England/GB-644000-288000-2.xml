   When I get up in the morning I have 
my breakfast and get dressed.At about 8
o'clock I go to school. Today,Monday we
had Maths for the first lesson.We had a
new boy arrive today,called Julian. At 
breaktime Mark, Paul and I played with 
him. We played "Off ground it". At     
dinner break we lined up and later I   
played with my penny racer. Mark's     
racer is the same as mine. Before last 
break we had French and played a game. 
We also had Handwriting and practised  
our capital letters.I am writing this  
during English &amp; Humanities before I go
home. At home I will have my tea and   
will go to bed at half past nine.
