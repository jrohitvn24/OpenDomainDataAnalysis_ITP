 The population of the area depend on  
 only one road. Lower down the valley, 
 this road tends to follow the river.  
 Just after crossing the river via     
 Peggy Bell's Bridge the road rises    
 towards the hill-farms of Greenside   
 hill and Hartside. During the winter  
 this latter section of the road can be
 difficult because of snow. In places  
 there are snow-fences but many of     
 these are run-down. The council-owned 
 road ends at Hartside. Beyond Hartside
 an identical but private road extends 
 just over a mile to Linhope. A gate   
 marks the boundary between the two    
 roads. Also at Hartside, another      
 private road leads down to Alnham-moor
 farm on the way to Bleakhope. This    
 becomes a high-level road which is    
 often blocked by snow in winter.
