		<title>16POSTAL SORTING OFFICE</title>
		<content> In Alwoodley there is a postal sorting
 office which serves this and          
 surrounding areas.Letters arrive from 
 Leeds Central at 5.30a.m and 10.30a.m.
 30,000 to 40,000 letters a day are    
 sorted by hand into the "walks"which  
 are the postman's delivery rounds.    
 He makes 2 delivery rounds each day   
 except Sunday.He needs a signature    
 for registered letters.               
  In 1985 it costs 17p to send a letter
 by 1st class mail anywhere in the U.K.
 2nd class mail costs 13p per letter   
 and usually takes longer to arrive at 
 its destination.If the letters weigh  
 more than 60g then the price of the   
 stamp increases accordingly.
