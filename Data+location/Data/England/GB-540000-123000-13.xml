		<content> After play we do reading, workshop or 
 news. At 12.15 it is lunch. I hope it 
 is sausages and chips and baked beans.
 After lunch we get half an hour       
 playtime.                             
 In the afternoons we do music or      
 topics or sports. I like sports       
 afternoon best. I'm quite good at     
 obstacle and long jump. I'm not very  
 good at running or throwing. When we  
 get back its playtime. That lasts     
 until 2.45 p.m. After that we have a  
 story. It is the Jungle Book. At 3.15 
 p.m we go home. There are 10 of us who
 go home on the coach.
