		<title>08ST.MUNGO'S CHURCH DEARHAM</title>
		<content> Dearham church was built in 1130 a.d  
 Examples of the original Norman       
 architecture can be found in the main 
 doorway and chancel windows.in 1882   
 the building was restored and extended
 by the addition of a side isle and    
 chancel arch.georgian windows were    
 replaced in early english style.the   
 tower is a fourteenth century addition
 built for protection from the border  
 raids.it has 3 rooms linked by a right
 hand spiral staircase.originally the  
 bell was on top of the tower.The      
 church was dedicated to ST Mungo in   
 1932,the original dedication having   
 been lost.                            
 inside the church the font is probably
 a Roman origin though the carvings are
 Norman.the viking cross,Adam stone and
 Kenneth stone suggest a Saxon church  
 may have stood on this site.several   
 medieval coffin lids are on display.  </content>
