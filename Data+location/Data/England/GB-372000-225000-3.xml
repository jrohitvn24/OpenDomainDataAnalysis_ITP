		<title>03The Market Square at Newent</title>
		<content>  The Market Square is dominated by its
 stilted, half-timbered{Market House}  
 which dates from the reign of Queen   
 Elizabeth I. The remains of the first 
 Market House is behind a row of shops.
  The building was restored about 100  
 years ago by the then Lord of the     
 Manor, Richard Foley Onslow and in    
 1913 it was given to the Parish.      
  Today the area is still the centre of
 town life, the old building is a      
 tourist attraction and is used for    
 Town Council meetings and other local 
 organisations. There is a telephone   
 kiosk in the Square and a car park    
 that is usually full as most shops are
 nearby. To the south is the{Memorial  
{Hall}built in 1954 on the site of the 
 old cattle market and it commemorates 
 those who gave their lives in WW II,  
 it is used for dances concerts and    
 other events and seats 250 people.    </content>
