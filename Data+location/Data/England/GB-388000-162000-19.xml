		<content>   The Adventure Centre offers many    
 activities like sea side visits,      
 dancing, drumming, swimming, pool,    
 rounders, football, walking, rock     
 climbing, climbing, camping, canoeing 
 and ice skating at Bristol.  The      
 canoes are provided for us and there  
 are about 31.  We go out on the River 
 Avon which runs along side the centre.
   It is a sort of Youth Club with 150 
 people.  It costs Â£3 to join and 20p  
 per week.  The club also has jumble   
 sales and fetes.  The money from them 
 goes towards good causes.  I think    
 this club is a good idea because it   
 keeps young people occupied.
