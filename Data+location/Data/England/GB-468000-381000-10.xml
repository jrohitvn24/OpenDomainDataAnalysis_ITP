		<title>10Getting to School in Retford</title>
		<content> We located school at the centre of a  
{time and direction}chart.We found that
 75%of our class{walk}to school.Most   
 of these people are{located}to the    
 NEast of school.The greatest{density} 
 of people live in the NEast sector    
 within five minutes walking distance  
 from school.                          
 Three people from the S.West walk to  
 school.Three people from the          
 NWest,walk .Alison and John live in   
 the NWest on the Hallcroft            
 estate.Alison takes the bus and       
 John cycles in.Our teacher lives a    
 mile away from school and it takes    
 him about twenty minutes to walk      
 to school .                           
 I have noticed that the three people  
 in the SWest and the walker from      
 the NWest districts take the longest  
 time.                                 
                                       </content>
