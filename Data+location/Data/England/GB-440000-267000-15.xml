		<title>15The Village Shop Birdingbury</title>
		<content> We visited three shops to compare the 
 services they offered the community.  
 They all had{Post Offices}and the shop
 keepers were Sub-Postmasters.Each of  
 the shopkeepers said that the shops   
 did not make a profit and depended on 
 the post office section.The post      
 offices are widely used,mainly for the
 collection of pensions but more       
 recently for the new Girobank service.
 All the shops carried a vast selection
 of stock including dairy produce,fresh
 vegetables,tinned food,tobacco        
 products,stationery and small gifts.  
 The shopkeepers felt they were an     
 important part of the community and   
 acted as a local advertising agency   
 and information office.Unfortunately  
 they all also thought that the village
 shop would soon be a thing of the     
 past.
