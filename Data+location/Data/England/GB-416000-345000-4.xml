		<title>04Ashbourne Carnival</title>
		<content> You have to organise carnival around  
{Christmas time}because it needs a lot 
 of organising.The things which need   
 organising are the carnival floats so 
 they know which order of appearance   
 they have to go in.They have to decide
 where the stalls have to go and what  
 prizes they are going to give.Also the
 bands need a lot of organising and    
 practise to know which tunes to play  
 and how  to play them.{Round table    
 organises the carnival,they also      
 organise the{fire works}and the{torch 
{light procession}which is held on Fish
 Pond Meadow where the fair is at every
 carnival.Around carnival time we have 
{window decorations}where people       
 decorate their windows.There is always
 something wrong and you have to guess 
 what.There is a{carnival Queen}every  
 year.The point of the carnival is to  
 raise money for charity.              </content>
