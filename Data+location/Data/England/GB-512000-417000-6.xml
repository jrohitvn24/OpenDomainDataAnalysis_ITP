		<content> There are fishing ponds near Swinster 
 Lane. Pike and Bream can be caught    
 there. Some of the ponds are private. 
 Some of the ponds have recently been  
 filled in and thr land used for       
 farming. Some have been drained.      
 Winter's Pond is the best you can buy 
 bait, rods and floats there.          
    Mr. Winters organises a local      
 fishing match every year for the      
 Bontoft cup. This cup is for sea      
 fishing in the Humber Estuary.        
 Cod, eels and plaice can be caught    
 from the bank.                        
    There is also a casting competition
 every year.                           
    Pollution is increasing in the     
 Humber caused by factories and ships. 
 There have been serious oil spills.   
 This may be damaging fish stocks.
