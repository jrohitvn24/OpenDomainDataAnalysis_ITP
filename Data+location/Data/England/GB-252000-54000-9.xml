		<content>   {East Sherford Farm }is situated    
 approximately 2.5km south of Glen     
 Park Primary School. The farm existed 
 before the time of Sir Francis Drake, 
 and was given by Queen Elizabeth 1st  
 and has been in the family, until     
 quiet recently.                       
    The farm is run by four men, and is
 a dairy farm with 140 Friesan cows, 2 
 bulls and 50 calves.                  
    Each cow produces 1350 gallons of  
 milk a year. The farm provides milk to
 the Co-op Dairy in Plymouth. There is 
 also a herd of Charolais Cattle for   
 beef.                                 
    The cattle feed on silage and hay  
 in the winter, and on grass in spring 
 and summer. They grow rye corn and    
 corn barley.
