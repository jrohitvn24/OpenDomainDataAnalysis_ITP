{BIRTH OF PAST AND PRESENT INHABITANTS 
{             OF MANSTON.              
 THE FIRST GRAPH ON PAGE 11 SHOWS HOW  
 MANY PEOPLE WERE BAPTISED IN THE      
 MONTHS BETWEEN THE YEARS 1847-59. IN  
 THESE YEARS, AUGUST AND JANUARY WERE  
 THE MOST POPULAR MONTHS FOR BIRTH.    
 THIS WAS BECAUSE OF THE CHRISTMAS AND 
 EASTER HOLIDAYS, WHEN NO-ONE WORKED   
 AND THEY HAD TIME FOR OTHER           
 ACTIVITIES.  SEPTEMBER AND MAY ALSO   
 HAD QUITE HIGH BIRTH RATES.  BY       
 LOOKING AT THE GRAPH ON PAGE 12 OF    
 OUR SCHOOL MONTHS OF BIRTH WE CAN SEE 
 THAT AUGUST STILL HAS THE HIGHEST     
 BIRTH RATE, BUT SEPTEMBER IS JUST AS  
 HIGH.  DECEMBER HAS THE THIRD MOST    
 BIRTHS. I WAS BORN IN MARCH.
