		<content>   Nick Vrijland's Nursery in West     
 Cranleigh has one of the largest areas
 under glass in the country. He grows  
 mainly lettuces and has been in       
 business for 17 years.                
   The lettuces are grown in two ways. 
 The Danish way when they grow on a    
 layer of plastic to avoid soil        
 diseases with holes for the roots to  
 reach the soil.  The other way is just
 planting them in the soil.            
   They grow three types of lettuce,   
 crisp ones which keep well, iceberg   
 which are tightly wrapped and         
 butterhead which have to be eaten     
 quickly.  The workers pick them by    
 hand and put them into boxes of 12.   
 They send 7_8000 boxes a week to      
 Supermarkets and shops all over       
 England.                              
   There are 16_17 workers who come    
 from all over Europe and N. Africa.   </content>
