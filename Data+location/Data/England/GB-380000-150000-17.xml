		<content>  Most  of  the  farms in the area were
 dairy farms but many are turning  over
 to half dairy and half arable  because
 of the  government policy  to cut milk
 production.                           
                                       
  Farmers  have  been told to cut their
 milk production by 7%.                
                                       
  We visited Cary's Farm.They have  110
 acres  and  100  cows.  They  exceeded
 their  milk   quota   but   were   not
 penalised  because  the  national milk
 production was lower.  They  have been
 told to cut by a further 1% this year.
 They are worried because their land is
 not  suitable for arable farming. They
 buy corn  for  their  cow feed  direct
 from   Mr. Tucker  who has 70 acres of
 arable land.  He also  has  2000  pigs
 including 230 breeding sows.
