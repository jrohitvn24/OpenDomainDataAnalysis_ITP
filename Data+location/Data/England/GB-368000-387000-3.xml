		<title>03Paddock Lane Farm, Heatley.</title>
		<content> The farmer's name is Eric Jennings    
 and he lives and works on the farm.   
 The house was built in{1717.}He has   
 lived there for 41 years.He grows     
 potatoes, barley, corn, wheat, hay and
 vegetables.They are planted between   
 March and November and harvested as   
 they ripen. He has many machines such 
 as corn drills, tractors, potato      
 elavators and a combine harvester,but 
 he still harvests all the vegetables  
 except the potatoes by hand.Only three
 men work on the farm.Father, son and  
 nephew share all the jobs between     
 them.The vegetables are sold          
 immediately, but some of the potatoes 
 and the grain are stored.There are no 
 longer any animals on the farm because
 the fields are so far apart and there 
 was too much road work involved in    
 milking the cows.
