		<title>06ATTLETON GREEN</title>
		<content>The Green itself is one of the finest  
of the Greens of Wickhambrook (some of 
which are very tiny). Attleton Green   
has a pond, with shady trees around it,
and which is surrounded by pleasant    
cottages and houses.   Some of these   
are quite new (fetching #60 000 in     
1985) but he most picturesque is the   
Old Workhouse.   This thatched building
now known as Woodlea and East Cottage, 
has recently been restored and re-     
thatched.   There is a 16th Century    
farmhouse - Butlers Hall - and two     
other farmhouses - Grove Farm and      
Attleton Farm - and all are occupied   
by practising farmers.  Melford House  
is the HQ of an Agricultural           
contractor.   To the W of the Green is 
a small development of modern          
bungalows.
