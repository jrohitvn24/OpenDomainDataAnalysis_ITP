		<content> Although today there are few people   
 living in these downland areas there  
 is much evidence to show that over the
 centuries there has been continuous   
 occupation. The ancient trackway      
 running W-E via Coulter's Dean was a  
 much used thoroughfare, and crossing  
 it from N-S traces remains of other   
 tracks. Ploughing in any part reveals 
 traces of occupation from the Iron Age
 onwards, but much ahs been destroyed  
 by repeated cultivation.              
 Principle sites are; Bronze Age       
 barrows on Wardown, Iron Age pits,    
 Romano-British settlement. Saxon      
 spearheads and pottery have been      
 found and there is evidence that this 
 was the line of a Saxon road leading  
 to Old Idsworth.
