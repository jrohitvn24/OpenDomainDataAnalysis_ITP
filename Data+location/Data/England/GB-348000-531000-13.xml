		<title>13LIFE IN NORTHWEST PENRITH</title>
		<content> Life in north west Penrith somtimes   
 gets very rough.There is a man that   
 goes round threatening and chasing    
 children.Many of the men that live on 
 Voreda Park Estate work for           
 British Gypsum.The railway line runs  
 straight past Raislands Croft,&amp; lads  
 throw stones at passing trains,which I
 think is stupid:you never know what   
 might happen.When I am not out        
 delivering papers I like to walk my   
 dogs and to play Football.On the      
 Voreda Park Estate all we have is one 
 tiny little patch of grass about 40   
 sq.meters!                            
 When I leave school I hope someday to 
 start my own business,this week-end I 
 am going to wash cars with one of my  
 friends.We are not bothered about the 
 Fells &amp; the Lakes,because we are so   
 used to it around us,&amp; in the Summer  
 it's packed with Tourists.            </content>
