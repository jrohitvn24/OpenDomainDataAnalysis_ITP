		<title>17My House</title>
		<content>     My house has 11 windows.   There  
are 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, a dining   
room, a kitchen and a hall.   In the   
kitchen there is a cooker and a sink.  
The living room  has a three-piece     
suite, a coffee table, a cabinet and a 
television.   There is a wooden chair  
that my dad made.   In my bedroom there
is a bed by the window and a shelf     
above with my pottery on and some      
dolls.   Opposite the window is my     
wardrobe, next to that is my desk.   At
the bottom of my bed is a bookshelf    
with lots of books on it.   In the     
bathroom there is a bath, a wash basin 
and a toilet.   We have another room   
where we keep the freezer and the      
washing machine.
