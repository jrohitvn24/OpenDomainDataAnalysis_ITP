 Abbots Park,situated opposite the     
 church and so named because long ago  
 it formed part of an abbot's property,
 was a rough pasture,grazed by cows    
 from a nearby farm.Among its grasses  
 one could find 8 or more species of   
 butterfly,including the common blue   
 and the holly blue.Large flocks of    
 swallows and martins swooped over the 
 grass,and during the migrating season 
 black redstarts passed through.The    
 high-pitched scream of swifts could be
 heard above the chorus of bird-song   
 and at dusk the even higher-pitched   
 squeaking of bats was a common sound. 
 By Christmas 1973 the builders had    
 moved in and the first house of a new 
 estate had been completed.The area was
 a sea of mud and its wildlife was in  
 retreat.
