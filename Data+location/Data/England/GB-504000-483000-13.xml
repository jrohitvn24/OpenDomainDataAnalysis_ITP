		<content>  The church of St.John the Baptist was
 built in Cayton in the 12th century   
 and in nearly 800 years there have    
 been 37 vicars. It had a clock fixed  
 in the tower in 1947 as thanksgiving  
 for not having lost any of the men    
 sent to fight in two world wars.      
 The present Methodist Chapel was built
 in 1903 to replace an old building.   
 The Jubilee Hall was originally the   
 old school built in 1877 and closed in
 1972 when the new school was built. It
 was reopened in 1978 as a community   
 centre.                               
 The Village Hall was built in 1969 and
 is used for many local occasions.     
 The Senior Citizens' Centre has 28    
 bungalows,with a resident warden,and a
 hall for social gatherings.           
 Osgodby Community Centre is used by   
 the people of Osgodby.                
 A 17th century cottage still stands.  </content>
