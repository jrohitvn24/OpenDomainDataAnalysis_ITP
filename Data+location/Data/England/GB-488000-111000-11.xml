		<content> All Saints Church, East Dean, no      
 longer has its own parish priest, but 
 now comes under the care of the Rector
 of Singleton. A service is held in the
 church every Sunday, with a family    
 service every month when the children 
 are encouraged to bring their musical 
 intruments, which makes the service a 
 very happy occasion.                  
                                       
 East Dean Free Church also has a good 
 following of local people, Sunday     
 school is held at this church and a   
 sunshine hour on Tuesday, both are    
 well attended. A women's section also 
 meets each week.
