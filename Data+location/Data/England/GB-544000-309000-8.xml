		<title>08THE FENS AND FISHING.</title>
		<content> The Fens is one of the most important 
 coarse fishing areas in the           
 country.Nowadays fishing is a very    
 popular leisure activity.Anglers do   
 not usually fish for food,they use    
 sophisticated tackle and they do need 
 a permit.However in the past poaching 
 for fish ,especially eels, was a way  
 of providing extra food and           
 income.Rods and lines were rarely     
 used.When the drains were pumped the  
 water flow was reduced to a trickle   
 and poachers would use a pilfer (a 5  
 or 7 pronged fork.)When eels were     
 being sought a glaive (an implement   
 similar to a pilfer)was employed.Big  
 fish such as the pike were caught in  
 nets.
