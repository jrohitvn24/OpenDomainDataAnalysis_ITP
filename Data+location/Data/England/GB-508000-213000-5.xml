		<content>    Since this area is in the commuter 
 belt around London this influences    
 farming, which can be subdivided into:
 1 {CEREALS}- The main type of farming,
 the cereals grown being wheat and     
 Barley.  The farmers use oil-seed rape
 as a break crop and to take advantage 
 of Common Market subsidies.           
    A typical cereal farm is St Agnells
 Farm, it has 178 acres of cereals and 
 17 acres of grazing land.  It grows   
 wheat, barley and oats and employs 2  
 people.  The farm is highly mechanised
 and the grain is stored in a 40 ton   
 silo - a common feature in the        
 landscape.                            
    Large amounts of pesticide are used
 to ensure maximum harvest. The farmer 
 keeps beef cattle on the grazing land 
 in the valley where it is too wet for 
 cereals.  He grows oil seed rape as a 
 break crop on his cereal land.        </content>
