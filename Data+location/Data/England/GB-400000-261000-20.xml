		<title>20BARRETTS OF FECKENHAM 2</title>
		<content>  The present shop has been  re fitted 
 this year into separate pine shelved  
 departments.                          
  Barretts of Feckenham advertise on   
 Midlands television so they attract   
 custom from all round the West        
 Midlands. They are one of the biggest 
 outlets for saddlery and riding       
 clothes in the country.               
  The camping section is demonstrated  
 in the adjacent field and is open for 
 nine months of the year.              
  Barretts employ about 25 staff on a  
 full time and part time basis. It is  
 however still essentially a family run
 business with the Barrett family      
 holding the majority of shares.       
 Most of the emplyees travel from      
 Bromsgrove or Redditch each day. As   
 there is no public transport the store
 has a van to collect their staff each 
 morning.                              </content>
