		<title>06GLOVER'S FARM, LITTLEPORT</title>
		<content> This{mixed}farm is on the road to     
 Mildenhall some miles out of the      
 village. It is mainly{arable}on peat. 
 It has changed by having more modern  
 buildings like potato sheds and the   
{piggeries.}On the farm there are over 
 three hundred pigs.The oldest animal  
 is a six year old sow.                
 There are one hundred and seventy two 
 acres.The main things grown are       
 sugar beet, potatoes and wheat.The    
 farmer thinks that machinery is a lot 
 better now than it was in the olden   
 days.The oldest tractor he has is     
 eighteen years old. He said that      
 farming is a very full-time job.      
 Winter is the hardest season but      
 spring is usually the worst for       
 weather. The hardest thing to grow on 
 the farm is wheat because it needs a  
 lot of care. The farm is 120 years    
 old.                                  </content>
