<title>21Updating a day in the life of Joanne</title>
<content>

I think that I'm the Joanne that wrote this article in 1986.  How times have changed. I still remember Mrs Keeling and her amazing animals. Since then I've married Lee and  we've had three lovely children, aged 7, 5 and 3. We are now living in Dorset.  &lt;br />&lt;br />My children's school day is very different as school starts at 8.30 and finishes at 4.15 for them, though they still have cooked dinners which is very unsual nowadays.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also I was one of the children along with my brother in the plane... I still remember that day flying over our home in Ibstock.   &lt;br />&lt;br />Everytime we go to through Heather we always look at the trees that my class planted on the road to Ibstock.  I also vividly remember Mr Hughes reading "Pilgrim's Progress" to us and I think this must have started my love of books along with The Famous Five! &lt;br />&lt;br />
