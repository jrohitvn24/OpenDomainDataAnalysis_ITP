		<title>15HOUSING IN TARRANT VALLEY</title>
		<content>  On our exploration of our block large
 areas had no houses at all,other areas
 just had farm buildings.But where     
 there were groups of houses or        
 villages we noticed three very        
 different types of building materials.
 The few new houses or bungalows were  
 made of bricks with tiles on their    
 roofs and were just like our house on 
 the estate where I live.The houses    
 that were older were built using      
 bricks with layers of flints in       
 between.These houses had slate tiles  
 on their roofs.The cottages that were 
 the oldest of the buildings we came   
 acros were made of stone with plaster 
 on the outside.What made them look so 
 pretty were their thatched roofs.Some 
 of them had been made modern but they 
 looked ever so small.Some of the      
 thatches were very old.
