		<content> Many recreational activities and      
 events take place at Roundhay Park.   
 Areas are assigned for crown green    
 bowls, cricket, and football training.
  The large grass arena is used for    
 cycling, jogging, marathons, and field
 events; the two lakes for fishing,    
 boating, windsurfing and regattas.    
 Events such as the Leeds Flower Show  
 and bonfire night celebrations are    
 held yearly. The park is also the     
 venue for various other events which  
 include pop and brass band concerts,  
 fairs, civil war battles, police day  
 and charity fundraising. People use   
 the park for walks, picnics, visiting 
 the flower gardens feeding the ducks  
 and geese, and fishing in the lakes.  
 The Mansion House is now a restaurant 
 catering for weddings and functions   
   A new lakeside cafe supplies all    
 year refreshments.                    </content>
