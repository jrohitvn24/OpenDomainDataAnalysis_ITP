		<content> The most populated part has a{family  
{centre}administered by the mother     
 church, St. Barnabas (out of this     
 block) used for{Anglican services,    
 taken by the vicar; also for{R.C.     
 services for which a priest comes from
 Burnham, 6 miles away. The centre is  
 used for other community activities   
 and there is a{weekly service}for     
 mothers and children which is well    
 attended, but this is seen as a short 
 term measure, as far as church        
 attendance is concerned. Others may   
 use Christchurch in Latchingdon, where
 there is a{non conformist chapel.     
 There is a vicar resident in          
 Maylandsea. The Anglican congregations
 are not large and the free evangelical
 type of worship has an increasing     
 following.
