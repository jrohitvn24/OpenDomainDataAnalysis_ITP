		<content> Mrs H Chapman started an art group in 
 1974 after she had attended evening   
 classes at Worcester Technical        
 College, taken by Mr G Vivis after    
 whom the group is named. She wished to
 continue her hobby within an          
 organized, informal group. Her home   
 was large enough to accommodate the   
 group. They originally used the attic 
 which they painted white yo relfect   
 the light, as a studio. From this a   
 flourishing centre has developed.     
 Courses now include pottery, painting,
 lace making, batik, caligraphy, flower
 arrangements and hobby ceramics. Fees,
 formerly 50p per session, now vary    
 according to the course taken. Other  
 rooms are now used and children's     
 courses are most popular.
