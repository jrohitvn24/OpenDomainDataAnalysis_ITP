		<title>10 New Housing Development</title>
		<content> Along Flexford Road there is a lot of 
 rural countryside. But now all that is
 going to change with a brand new      
 Housing Estate.                       
                                       
 This new Housing Estate will have 1700
 houses with a lot of new features     
 including cycleways.                  
                                       
 This estate will be situated between  
 Knightswood Farm and Manor Farm. When 
 we spoke to some of the people        
 involved they had mixed feelings.     
                                       
 It will be a village in it's self     
 including public services such as a   
 school, playing fields, a few shops a 
 nature reserve and public transport.  
                                       
 This will radically change the        
 countryside and population of the     
 area.                                 </content>
