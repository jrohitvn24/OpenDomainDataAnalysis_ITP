		<title>10TURKEY FARM</title>
		<content> The Turkey farm is called 'Chisbon    
 Turkey Farm nad is owned by Mr.Snell. 
 The size of the farm is very big with 
 lots of buildings and big sheds.      
 Mr.Snellhas been working at the farm  
 since 1963. Heusually gets up in th   
 morning at 7.00am. and goes to bed at 
 midnight.                             
 Mr. Snell breeds his own turkeys from 
 his breeding stock and has about 1500 
 turkeys at present. He tries to get as
 much money as possible for each one   
 but the cost varies from time to time.
 The turkeys are electricuted and then 
 their necks are broken by twisting    
 their heads.After,they hang them up   
 and then pluck the feathers off and   
 put the feathers in the middle of the 
 room.Then they cut off their heads and
 feet and gut them. They are then ready
 to be sold whole or cut up into joints
 for sale.                             </content>
