		<content> In August 1975 Dodford village was    
 made into a conservation area. The    
 majority of the Chartists' plots are  
 still there. Church Road, Victoria    
 Road and Woodlands Road still are very
 narrow with hawthorn hedges. Each plot
 of land is 4 acres. Several Chartist  
 bungalows still exist though some have
 been altered slightly and modernised  
 inside. When the Chartists lived there
 the main crop was strawberries (on the
 clay soil) but now grass is the main  
 crop, for hay and grazing for horses. 
 No trees or hedges cna be cut down in 
 Dodford.
