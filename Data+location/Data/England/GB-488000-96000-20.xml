{The Prince and Princess of Wales}could
 be visiting Aldwick in the summer of  
 1985 to see Earl Spencer who owns     
 three properties in the area.  The    
 earl would like his grandchildren to  
 come, as they haven't yet visited him 
 at Bognor.  They may be coming for a  
 break before heading to Balmoral. The 
 earl's houses are near the site of    
 Craigweil House where George V stayed.
