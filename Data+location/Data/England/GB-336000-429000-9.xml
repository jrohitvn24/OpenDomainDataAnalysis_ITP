     The railway that joins Kirkham and
Blackpool South runs through Wrea      
Green.   Trains do not stop in the     
village but  go on to the Halt at Moss 
Side.   On some parts of the railway   
line there is only one track.   A few  
years ago B.R. tried to close the line 
but the people protested so much that  
it was kept open.   The line starts at 
Kirkham and makes its way through Wrea 
Green, Moss Side, Lytham, and St. Annes
to Blackpool.   It was opened 140 years
ago and his been in continuous use.    
                                       
     During the summer 12 trains a day 
use the line.   The price for a cheap  
day return from Kirkham to Blackpool is
#1.60.
