		<content> Outside my house I have got a front   
 garden and a back garden.In 1984 we   
 had a pond in our front garden but my 
 dad gave away all the fish and filled 
 the pond in.Where the pond was we     
 didn't have any plants so my dad put  
 our caravan there.A caravan is like   
 a mini moving home.Our caravan is     
 fifteen foot long.Beside the caravan  
 there is a drive where we keep our    
 cars.We have got a four wheel base    
 Land Rover and a 1984 Fiesta.At the   
 front of my garden we have got a      
 wooden fence.                         
       My back garden has got a shed   
 and a greenhouse in it.My dad keeps   
 all his tools in his shed,like a      
 hammer,a screw driver and lots of     
 other tools.Next to the shed there is 
 a greenhouse.In the greenhouse dad    
 is growing lots of plants.He has
