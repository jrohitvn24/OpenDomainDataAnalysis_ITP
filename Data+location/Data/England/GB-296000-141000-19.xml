 At the moment the school has 95       
 children. They are admitted in the    
 educational year that they become 5   
 years old and leave after the year in 
 which they become 9 years old.        
 When they leave most of the children  
 go on to Minehead Middle School and   
 then, after four years, to the West   
 Somerset School.                      
 Amongst the latest technological aids 
 to teaching in the school are a colour
 television, video recorder and a      
 computer with disc drive on which this
 information is being recorded.
