		<title>04NEW BRIGHTON STATION</title>
		<content> The station opened in 1888. It is a   
 short distance from the promenade. It 
 is built  mainly of red brick. It has 
 a clock tower.There is a book in      
 Earlston Road reference library called
 "Steel Wheels to Deeside"by John      
 Graham,this gives its history.Today   
 the station is used by passengers from
 West Kirby,Rock Ferry and Liverpool.  
 The ticket man told us that 70 trains 
 per day come into the station. The    
 ladies toilet has a small stove fire  
 in, and old brasstaps on the sinks.   
 there is an old brass light switch and
 stone tiles on the floor. Where the   
 old waiting room used to be, is now a 
 recording studio where local groups   
 can go and make records.There is also 
 a new cafe in the studio which sells  
 tea, coffee and cakes to travellers.It
 is called the Whistle Stop.
