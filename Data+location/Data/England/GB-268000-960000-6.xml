		<content> We conducted a census in our block    
 using the voters roll as a basis.     
 There are 218 people in our block,    
 mostly living in the village.         
 Therefore a large part of our area is 
 deserted.  There are 120 women and    
 only 98 men.  There is a total of 55  
 pensioners and 35 of them are women.  
 There are 44 children under the age of
 16 and again most are female (26).    
 Eleven males are unemployed out of a  
 total of 60 males of working age.     
 This is 18% and is well above the     
 national average. Of the 59 females of
 working age 29 are employed.  Most of 
 these work part time as home helps or 
 in the shops or hotels.  The populatin
 has dropped 50% since the turn of the 
 century. Sadly this decline continues.
