		<title>01 THE AREA SOUTH OF WINGRAVE</title>
		<content>     Wingrave is a village out in the  
countryside. There are a few villages  
close by.One village is Rowsham which  
is very small and has a main road      
running through it.There are no shops  
or recreation ground so some of the    
children come to Wingrave to play.     
There is a farm named Bailey's farm.   
They don't grow crops and all their    
land is grass land.                    
A bit farther away is Hulcott which is 
a small village as well.It has a old   
nursing home which looks after old     
people.The only churches around our    
area are in Wingrave and Hulcott.The   
church in Hulcott is 250yrs old.The    
Wingrave church was built in Norman    
times.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
