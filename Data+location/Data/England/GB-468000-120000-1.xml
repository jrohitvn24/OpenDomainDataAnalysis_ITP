		<content> Our Domesday area stretches from      
 Butser Hill, north to Park Hill and   
 from the hamlet of Ramsdean, west to  
 the village of East Meon, which was   
 mentioned in the Domesday Book. This  
 is a rural area set amongst the       
 rolling chalk hills of the western end
 of the South Downs. Although dry      
 valleys are common, our area contains 
 a river - the River Meon, which rises 
 in the south-west corner of the area. 
 This area has probably been settled   
 continuously for 5000 years; there is 
 evidence of Neolithic Man on both     
 Butser and Barrow Hills, and there is 
 a tradition of Roman settlement.      
 Intensive farming now prevails. Much  
 downland pasture has been ploughed for
 rape and wheat crops,although sheep   
 are grazed on steeper slopes. Butser  
 Hill has been preserved within the    
 Queen Elizabeth Country Park.         </content>
