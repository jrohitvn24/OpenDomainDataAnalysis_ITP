		<title>11VILLAGE CONCERNS</title>
		<content> The Parish Councils make decisions on 
 the local minor matters at their      
 monthly meetings (following national  
 guidelines). Only one or two members  
 of the public turn up to these        
 although the Annual Parish Meeting in 
 West Wratting is very well attended   
 (30-40 people out of a population of  
 400) when a member of all the clubs in
 the community make a report. There are
 topics which cause concern to the     
 villagers and re-appear every few     
 years:- lack of street lighting (too  
 expensive); bus shelters; the state of
 the roads; stubble burning; closure   
 of the Pubs due to lack of use (the   
 one in Weston Green The Fox and Hounds
 this year,the one in West Wickham The 
 White Horse a few years ago but it has
 just re-opened, the one in West       
 Wratting soon). The rest are long     
 gone.                                 </content>
