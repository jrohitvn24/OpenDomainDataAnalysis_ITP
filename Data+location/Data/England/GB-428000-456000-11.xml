		<title>11KENNELL HALL FARM</title>
		<content>   Mentioned in the Domesday Book the  
 farm is now a dairy farm of 150 acres 
 and is owned by Mr. &amp; Mrs Will.       
 Morrell who moved there in 1959.      
   There is no record of the present   
 age of the farm as the deeds were     
 thrown into the fire by a previous    
 owner in a fit of temper.  It was     
 previously owned by the Strother      
 Family of Westfield House who owned   
 all of Killinghall and much of the    
 land up to{Pateley Bridge.}           
   The farmhouse4 still uses the 11th. 
 Century beams, one oif which is 29feet
 long. Non of the windows have been    
 stoned-in and are large which probably
 means it was once owned by royalty,   
 probably{John of Gaunt}who once lived 
 in Knaresborough Castle. It is        
 believed he used it to kennel his     
 hunting dogs hence the farm's name.
