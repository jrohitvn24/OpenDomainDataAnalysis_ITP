		<content>    The weekly shopping expedition to  
the supermarkets in the neighbouring   
town of High Wycombe has largely       
replaced the buying of food in the     
local shops.Only a small fraction use  
the neighbourhood shops on a regular   
basis,though most use them at times.   
    Convenience foods and take-aways   
are in general use - though a recent   
campaign to encourage children towards 
healthy eating habits has been carried 
out at Downley Middle School.          
    Although less than 10% work allot- 
ments,vegetables and fruit feature in  
many gardens.As well as the popular    
beans,tomatoes,potatoes,onions and     
carrots,gardeners are experimenting    
with courgettes,asparagus and spinach. 
    Similarly,while apples, rhubarb and
soft fruits remain the predominant     
fruits grown,grapes,peaches,melons,    
and figs feature in some gardens.      </content>
