		<title>09TRAFFIC SURVEY ON M1 AND A5</title>
		<content>    This traffic count was taken       
 mid_morning on Saturday 18 May for    
 half an hour.  It did not, therefore, 
 include commuter traffic which would  
 have expanded these numbers           
 considerably.  It should be noted     
 however, that it was Cup Final day and
 this would exaggerate the numbers of  
 south moving vehicles on the M1.      
    On the A5, there was an evenly     
 balanced flow with 212 vehicles going 
 north and 208 going south.            
    On the M1, there was a much heavier
 flow 940 vehicles moving south and 673
 moving north.                         
    These surveys also show the weight 
 of transport carried by the M1 and the
 problems this will cause during repair
 of if there is an accident.  Local    
 roads then become totally congested.
