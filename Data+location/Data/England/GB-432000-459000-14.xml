		<content>  Part of Farnham Parish Church dates  
 back to the time of the original      
 Domesday.                             
                                       
  At Scotton the Percy's had a house,  
 since destroyed, next to the church,  
 where their shield can be seen painted
 on the ceiling.                       
                                       
  The area around Scotton and Brearton 
 has had a long association with the   
 Mountgarrett family.                  
                                       
  The Parish Church of Brearton is     
 owned by the Mountgarretts and rented 
 to the village at a peppercorn rent.  
 It was concecrated in 1837 and        
 included Okany (the old spelling of   
 Occaney) in its parish.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
