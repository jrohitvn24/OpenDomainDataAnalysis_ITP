		<title>18GROWERS CO-OPERATIVE</title>
		<content>  The horticultural nature of the area 
 is typified by a Growers Co-operative 
 called Littleton and Badsey Growers.  
 The Co-operative was started in 1908  
 by Charles Binyon and in 1985, 1260   
 growers are using the facilities for  
 bulk buying and co-operative          
 marketing.  The present site covers   
 some 12 acres of ground and although  
 some of the buildings are old,new     
 warehouses are being added.  The      
 Co-operative has recently installed   
 (at the expense of 16,000) a vacuum  
 cooler to give a better shelf life to 
 green leaved vegetables.  The         
 co-operative have more expensive      
 equipment, installed some years ago,  
 in the form of a  herb dryer which    
 processes most of the dried herbs at  
 present sold in this country.         
  L.B.G lorries serve the U.K and      
 occasionally go to the continent.     </content>
