		<content> Our school is a First School. Children
 start when they are 4 or 5 and go to  
 the Middle School when they are nine. 
 We have 43 children here. There are   
 two classes. The little ones are in   
 one class and the older children in   
 the other one. We use a computer that 
 we play games on to help us learn. We 
 do maths and some of us use Unifix to 
 help us. Sometimes we do writing about
 what we do at weekends or interesting 
 places we have visited. We also do    
 English, projects, science and art.   
 For P.E. we put on our shorts and tee-
 shirts. We have skipping ropes, balls,
 hoops apparatus and mats to roll on.  
 Our latest project is about Indians.  
 We have spelling tests and table      
 tests.                                
 School starts at 9 o'clock and we go  
 home at quater past 3. We have dinner 
 in school as well. A man brings it in </content>
