 area.We have mainly arable and        
 horticultural crops.The most common   
 crops are wheat and barley.We have    
 many green-houses to grow things like 
 flowers,lettuces and tomatoes.        
    We have many well known crops      
 including sugar beet.We take our sugar
 beet to the factory in Spalding.      
    We have fruit like strawberries,   
 blackberries and gooseberries.        
    We have plenty of flowers like     
 daffodils,tulips,roses and stocks.    
    We have got a few cows so we can   
 get milk,cheese,cream and bread and   
 one thing especially,meat.            
    We have many vegetables like       
 turnips swede ,parsnips and carrots
