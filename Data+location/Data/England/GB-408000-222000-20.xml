		<title>20GUITING POWER.SEED MERCHANT</title>
		<content>    The seed-merchant at Naunton buys  
 and sells grain to farmers,also seed- 
 corn and fertiliser.They sell wheat to
 flour-mills for bread or animal feed. 
 They may take it to Avonmouth for     
 export to Africa,Germany,France,Italy 
 and Eire.                             
    The business is over 100 years old.
 They employ 30 people,clerks and farm 
 representatives.They use contract     
 lorries to pick up the wheat,barley   
 and oats. In the busy season,they     
 receive 20 loads daily,400 tons.      
    They have a laboratory where wheat 
 is tested for moisture if it is for   
 keeping,or for protein if for milling.
 Some grain goes for cattle-cake which 
 consists of barley,wheat and soya     
 bean.                                 
    They handle 100000 tons yearly and 
 plan six months in advance.
