		<content> Now in ruins Pontefract Castle was    
 once one of the most important castles
 in the north. Built on solid rock,    
 with a sheer drop to the north and a  
 deep dry moat, it gives extensive     
 views to the north and east. still to 
 be seen are the bases of seven,       
 towers,the gatehouse and connecting   
 walls, as well as the layout of the   
 bakehouse with round beehive ovens,   
 and the buttery.                      
 Recently rubble and vegetation was    
 cleared and stone work cleaned and    
 pointed.Steps to the top of the were  
 revealed.The outline of the Norman    
 Chapelcan now clearly be seen.The     
 Castle grounds make a popular         
 walkingarea for young and old,school  
 parties can frequently be seen        
 investigating the ruins.Under the lawn
 is the magazine used as a dungeon in  
 the sieges.     Wayne Chapman.        </content>
