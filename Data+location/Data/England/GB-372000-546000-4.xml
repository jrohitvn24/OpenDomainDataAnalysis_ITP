		<content> Many different kinds of{wild flowers, 
{grasses}and{trees}grow along the banks
 of the{River Nent}and many{insects}and
{butterflies}can be seen there. In July
{Oyster Catchers}nest between Blaygill 
 Bridge and Foreshield.   In this      
 region the river changes its character
 as it{meanders}through a wide{flood   
{plain}forming banks of coarse sand and
 shingle.   At several points along the
 river the recently capped{ventilation 
{shafts}from the{Nent Force Level}can  
 be seen. This tunnel, now sealed, runs
 for over four miles under the river.  
 Begun in l776 and finished in l842, it
 was built to drain the lead mines     
 further up the valley and take out the
 lead and waste products.  Some hope   
 that it will one day be re-opened as a
 tourist attraction.  Paths have       
 recently been improved by the Manpower
 Services to encourage tourists.       </content>
