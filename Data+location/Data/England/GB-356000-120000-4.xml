 part of a large and profitable company
 manufacturing six different varieties 
 of British wine and producing between 
 150,000 and 300,000 litres a week and 
 in a year 10,000000 litres on average.
 Concentrated grape juice is imported  
 from Greece,Cyprus,Italy and Spain.   
 The juice is mixed with water and     
 sugar to ferment.The liquid is then   
 passed through filters to purifiy it  
 and make it crystal clear.Samples are 
 taken and sent to the laboratory to be
 tested for alcohol content, sweetness,
 colour and taste.The wine is stored in
 vats to mature.Finally it is taken to 
 the Midlands for bottling.            
 The winery has a vat made of English  
 Oak which holds 63,000 gallons and is 
 thought to be the biggest in England.

 winery doing the 4 separate processes.</content>
