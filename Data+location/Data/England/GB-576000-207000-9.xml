		<title>09THE PEOPLE OF LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content>   The people living in the vicinity of
 Little Baddow can be divided into two 
 broad catagories. Firstly there are   
 the people who have lived in the area 
 for most of their lives and who earn  
 their living in and around the        
 village. Secondly there are the people
 who have moved into the village       
 because they find it so pleasant and  
 whose work means that they must become
 commuters travelling to larger centres
 of employment. The people seem to like
 the village very much but the longer  
 term residents comment on the many    
 changes that have taken place in      
 recent years. Due to its closeness to 
 Chelmsford Little Baddow has not      
 suffered from the same problems of    
 depopulation encountered by many rural
 villages. The number of people living 
 there has risen from 500 in 1925 to   
 2000 today.                           </content>
