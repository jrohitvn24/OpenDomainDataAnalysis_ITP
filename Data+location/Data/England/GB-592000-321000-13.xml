		<content> Most women like reading or gardening, 
 but some like watching tennis on      
 television and listening to the radio.
 Some belong to the Womens Institute   
 which meets in Brisley Village Hall.  
  The men in the area like doing       
 unusual things for their hobbies which
 we all take advantage of, like playing
 the fiddle,carving things out of      
 wood,relaxing,watching T.V., building 
 things,fixing engines and working with
 pigs.                                 
   The women that do hobbies out of the
 area have more involved hobbies such  
 as singing (E.Dereham) and keep fit   
 (Whissonsett).There is a lot of effort
 goes into these hobbies.              
  Some men go out of the block to do   
 their hobbies: building trailers      
 (Gressenhall), sailing (Norfolk       
 coast),or playing tennis (Fakenham).
