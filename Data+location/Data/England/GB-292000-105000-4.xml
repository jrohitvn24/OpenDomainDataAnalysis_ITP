		<title>04THE RIVER EXE</title>
		<content> The river in this stretch is used for 
 recreation. Fishermen regularly fish  
 for trout and salmon. Due to pollution
 fewer fish are now caught.            
 The flow conditions make it suitable  
 for canoeing; several races take place
 annually. In September the river hosts
 a home-made raft race, a very popular 
 event.                                
 The Exe in flood is a different       
 picture from the peaceful scene with  
 the much photographed arched granite  
 bridge. Flooding has been eased by    
 prevention schemes and flow control   
 upstream. The river occasionally rises
 2.5m above normal level. The bridge is
 the main traffic crossing on the Exe  
 between Tiverton and Exeter. There are
 two foot bridges to the south.
