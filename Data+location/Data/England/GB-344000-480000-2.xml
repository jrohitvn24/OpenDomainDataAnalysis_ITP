		<content> Uncultivated and ungrazed land is     
 quickly colonised here by saplings,   
 except where bare rock is exposed. The
 most prolific colonisers on the       
 limestone soils are ash and sycamore -
 for example - along Throughs Lane in  
 Storth and on the steep banks of the  
 old{Kendal Railway}cutting.           
 Yews and hazels are common on the     
 limestone hills. On the peaty soils   
 across the estuary, the invading trees
 are chiefly birch and Scots pine.     
 The only significant area of          
 commercial woodland is{Foulshaw Moss,}
 west of the estuary. Thirty or forty  
 years ago Scots pine were planted on  
 the drier parts of the old peat moss  
 and are now quite tall, though rather 
 crowded and spindly. They should      
 eventually produce useful timber.
