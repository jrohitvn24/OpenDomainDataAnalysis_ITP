		<title>09Ingatestone - Housing.</title>
		<content> Outside Ingatestone and Fryerning     
 housing consists mainly of farmhouses 
 and smaller dwellings originally      
 constructed for farmworkers.          
 Ingatesone's main function is         
 residential and, in general, housing  
 is of a high standard. There are many 
 large detached houses in the area     
 which may cost anything from Â£80,000  
 upwards. There are also many estates  
 consisting of semi-detached houses    
 (typically having three or four       
 bedrooms) which can be bought from    
 about Â£45,000. Along the High Street  
 there are a number of small purpose   
 built blocks of flats (usually two    
 bedrooms and costing Â£30,000 or more).
 In addition to this privately owned   
 housing there are some council houses 
 available to rent though the stock is 
 declining as tenants exercise their   
 'right to buy' at a discount.         </content>
