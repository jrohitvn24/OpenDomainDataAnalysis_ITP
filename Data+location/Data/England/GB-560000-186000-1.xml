		<title>01INTRODUCING OUR AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
   The land in our area is mostly green
 belt farmland.There are two main      
 places of habitation.They are West    
 Horndon and Little Warley.West Horndon
 is the main one. It is a small and    
 peaceful village with good road       
 and rail links, an industrial site, a 
 park and a school. West Horndon was   
 built in the last hundred years. Most 
 of the people commute to London to    
 work. On the other hand Little Warley 
 is very old and was in the Domesday   
 Book. It used to be a very large      
 parish, but now there are no more than
 5 houses.                             
   Most of the farms in the area are   
 arable, but there is an abattoir.     
 There is a sewage treatment works     
 near Cranham so that means most of the
 area has mains drainage.
