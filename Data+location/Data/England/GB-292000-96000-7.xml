		<title>07STOKE CANON CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The chapel was built early this       
 century.                              
 The chapel has quite a lot of         
 meetings. The first meeting of the    
 week is Sunday School at 10.00 am.We  
 have a sing first of all, then we have
 a quiz. We have a star board and every
 four stars wins a prize.              
 The attendance is round about fifteen 
 people.                               
 The following meeting is at 11.15 am. 
 and we take bread and wine. It        
 finishes at 12.30 pm. The attendance  
 of that is about 20.                  
 We come back to the chapel at 6.30 pm.
 and a speaker comes and speaks to us  
 and it ends at 7.30 pm. The attendance
 is about 40. After, we have a meeting 
 called after meeting. It finishes at  
 9.30 pm. We have a few other meetings 
 as well.
