		<title>14R.Hartley Bottle Works-cont</title>
		<content>      The bottle works already took up 
 part of the Dene, Bywell Terrace and  
 Queens Road, and after the extension  
 it took up part of Southward.         
 Eventually there were 6 glass houses, 
 each with their own names, Hartley,   
 Charlotte, Gallaghan, Success,        
 Waterford and Byass.                  
      In 1772 Sir Francis sold the     
 glasshouses and the cones to his      
 brother, Sir John Hussey Delaval. When
 he died the works went to his widow,  
 and when she died in 1822 they were   
 inherited by Susanna.                 
      In 1871 the glass manufactory was
 closed down. A year the last ship left
 Seaton Sluice, and 24 years later the 
 cones were pulled down to make room   
 for dwelling houses which are now     
 Queens Road, Bywell Terrace and       
 Southward council housing estates.
