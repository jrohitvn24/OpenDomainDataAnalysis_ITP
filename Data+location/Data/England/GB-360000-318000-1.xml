		<content>{This is primarily an agricultural     
{landscape lying to the North of the   
{market town of Wellington (Shropshire)
{which is itself the northern part of  
{Telford New Town.                     
{The land is flat, and lies at         
{approximately 60 metres above sea     
{level.   It is crossed by the River   
{Tern, itself a tributary of the River 
{Severn.                               
{Settlement in the area consists of one
{village, Waters Upton, and, in the    
{south-west of the block, part of the  
{village of Crudgington.   There is the
{samall hamlet of Rowton in the        
{north-west of the area, and a large   
{number of dispersed farms.            
{There is very little industry except  
{the creamery at Crudgington.   The    
{main A442 road runs N/S through the   
{eastern part of the block. }
