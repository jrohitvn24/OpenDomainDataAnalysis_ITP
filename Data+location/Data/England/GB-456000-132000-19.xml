		<title>19ALRESFORD SCHOOL APPEAL</title>
		<content>    In 1981 {Perin's School Appeal     
{Trust Fund (PAT) }was set up. Its aim 
 to initially raise #20,000. This has  
 been well exceeded over the years     
 since, and the school has used the    
 funds to help bolster the dwindling   
 educational resources. The school was 
 able to buy 10 microcomputers and     
 other necessary hardware. Other       
 departments bought their own micros., 
 some had a video recorder. The drama  
 department is able to hire            
 professional performers, in fact      
 every department has benefitted. One  
 of the big changes apart from the     
 introduction of Computer Studies and  
 an Awareness Course has been the      
 modernisation of the Business Studies 
 Department. It now has six word       
 processing work stations. The most    
 recent purchase is the new school     
 minibus to replace the old one.       </content>
