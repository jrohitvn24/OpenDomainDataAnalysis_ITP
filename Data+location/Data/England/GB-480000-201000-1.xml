		<content>The block consists of the small country
town of Princes Risborough and the     
surrounding countyside.                
The town is equidistant from Aylesbury 
and High Wycombe and is situated at the
foot of the Chilterns escarpment.      
The Chilterns in this area rise to a   
height of 200 metres and the higher    
slopes are wooded, mainly with beech   
trees but also some conifers are mixed 
with the famous beech. The lowerslopes 
are mainly used as permanent pasture,  
but there is also some arable land. The
Town is a nucleated settlement with a  
population of around 11,000. The       
Ridgeway path runs across the area;    
apart from the town itself, the whole  
area comes under the green belt and is 
included in the chilterns area of      
outstanding natural beaty.
