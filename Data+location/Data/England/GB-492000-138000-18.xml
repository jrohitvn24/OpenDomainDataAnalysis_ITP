		<content>  The playground at The Chandler Middle
 School measures approximately 35x45m. 
 There is space for two netball courts,
 two hopscotch areas and a jumping     
 ladder,which are all marked in        
 playground paint.                     
  Most of our playground games involve 
 the use of the marked lines for       
 boundaries or bases.The running and   
 catching games we play are:"Semi's",  
 "Forty-forty in!","Longways","Cages", 
 "Bob down it"and "British Bulldog".   
  Less enegetic games include "Doctor, 
 Doctor","Rotten Egg","Sly fox","Solemn
 sisters","Sticky glue","Polo","Lobster
 lobster","Red rover"and"Jelly babies".
 The girls play a complicated jumping  
 game called"French Elastic".Two people
 stand about a metre away from each    
 other with a piece of circular elastic
 arranged round their ankles.A third   
 person stands between them and jumps. </content>
