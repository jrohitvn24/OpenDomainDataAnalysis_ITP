		<content>  In 1648,the first skirmish of the    
 Civil War took place in the fields    
 near Powick. Royalist cavalry rode    
 unwittingly into a camp of Roundheads 
 near the bridge. Both were so startled
 that in the confusion the Cavaliers   
 escaped with the King's treasure in-  
 tact.                                 
  In  1651 Cromwell's army went through
 Powick on the way to a more bloody    
 battle against King Charles II,in     
 Worcester.                            
  In 1708, Dr.John Wall,was born in    
 Powick,and he was responsible for the 
 development of Royal Worcester        
 Porcelain,the Royal Infirmary,and     
 Malvern's growth as one of the more   
 austere Spa towns.
