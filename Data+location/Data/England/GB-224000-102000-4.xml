		<content>    In September 1932, the Uniting     
 Conference of the Methodist Church was
 held in London, and former Wesleyans, 
 Primitive Methodists and United       
 Methodists became members of one      
 Church. There were two chapels in     
 Bridgerule at the time of union and in
 or about 1941 the former Wesleyan     
 chapel was closed and the members     
 united with the former United         
 Methodist society to form the present 
 church. So the division of 1815 was   
 healed after 126 years of separation. 
 The old Wesleyan chapel was sold to   
 the parish council and is now in use  
 as a parish hall.                     
    In 1951 a further addition to the  
 chapel was made by the installation of
 a pipe organ.
