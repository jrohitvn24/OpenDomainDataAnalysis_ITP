 peoples hospital. There are 58 beds   
 there, but they also take 25 day      
 patients. The patients ages have      
 ranged from 65 to 110.There are 53    
 full time nurses and one consultant   
 who comes up from Plymouth.The        
 hospital takes patients from a very   
 wide area and is always full. In 1984 
 they had 110 admissions,70 discharges 
 and only 30 deaths. Many of the       
 elderly patients have physical        
 problems and there are special support
 staff to help them such as            
 occupational therapists and           
 physiotherapists.St.Mary's was        
 originally built as the Union         
 workhouse.There are plans for the     
 hospital to be rebuilt behind the     
 General Hospital.
