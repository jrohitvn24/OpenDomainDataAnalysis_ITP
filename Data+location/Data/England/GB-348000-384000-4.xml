		<title>04WEST BANK DOCK ESTATE-WIDNES</title>
		<content>  We went to the West Bank Dock Estate 
 in the car.We saw a ship wreck, two   
 men were digging out the mud. We saw  
 ships going past under the bridge.    
 The water had stones and bricks and   
 pieces of wood in the sand and mud.   
 Runcorn Bridge is good from underneath
 all the nuts and bolts look big.I     
 liked seeing the coal trucks going    
 over the bridge. We went past {       
{W.F.Hollways sand works}and{Marchem   
{Chemical Works.}We walked down{       
{Mathieson Road}to the{Weighbridge.}We 
 saw three lorries getting their loads 
 weighed.I saw birds and butterflies.  
 We brought some flowers, feathers and 
 two moths back to put on our interest 
 table. We were all drawing and then   
 we got back into the car.  When we got
 back to school we played British      
 Bulldog and I was on it. I said thank 
 you to the teachers. {JOANNE KUJAWIAK </content>
