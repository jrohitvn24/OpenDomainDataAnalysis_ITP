		<title>19Sunderland Point/People</title>
		<content> In recent years, the number of people 
 living at Sunderland Point and making 
 their living there has dwindled.      
 Farming, fishing, and piloting        
 occupies just three families and of   
 the other households about half       
 comprise retired or unemployed people,
 and the other half send one or more   
 adult members to work outside the     
 village as teachers, dock workers,    
 workers at the Heysham nuclear power  
 stations, nurses.                     
 The village has a high proportion of  
 young children but no school.         
 About half the households have family 
 links with the village for several    
 generations.                          
 Sunderland Point draws visitors       
 because of its unusual and attractive 
 setting on one of the few short       
 stretches of unspoilt coast in        
 Lancashire; its history and birdlife. </content>
