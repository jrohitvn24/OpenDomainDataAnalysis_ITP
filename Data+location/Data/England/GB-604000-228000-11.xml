		<content> Fox Ash Growers Packing Station begun 
 in 1934 when it belonged to the       
 government.  The packing station is   
 now owned by a co-operative of        
 smallholders and employs 60 people.   
 It owns 200 acres and grows some      
 produce, but 40 other smallholders    
 send their produce to the packing     
 station as well.  They pack lettuce,  
 tomatoes, celery, marrows and peppers.
 The salad is graded, put in boxes or  
 polythene and then put in a cold store
 to cool so that it will not go bad in 
 the shops.  It is transported in      
 refrigerated lorries 40 ft long.      
 Some produce goes to Covent Garden.   
 Supermarkets they supply include M.&amp; S
 B.H.S., Sainsbury, Asda, Argyl,       
 Safeways, Littlewoods and             
 International. They export celery to  
 Europe. Turnover for the packing      
 station is Â£l.5 million.              </content>
