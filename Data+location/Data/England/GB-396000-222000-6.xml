		<content> IN JUNE 1985, CHILDREN FROM{LYNWORTH  
{AND WHADDON PRIMARY SCHOOLS}AND{ST.   
{MICHAEL'S PLAYGROUP}JOINED TOGETHER   
 AND DREW SOME PICTURES OF SWINGS,     
 SLIDES AND ROUNDABOUTS, THINGS WE     
 WOULD LIKE IN{WHADDON RECREATION      
{GROUND}BECAUSE WHEN WE WANT TO GO TO  
 AN ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND WE HAVE TO GO 
 TO PITTVILLE PARK. IF YOU GO IN{      
{WHADDON RECREATION GROUND}ALL YOU WILL
 SEE IS GRASS AND THE REMAINS OF AN OLD
 PAVILION. ALL THE WORK WE DID WENT ON 
 SHOW IN TOWN, AT WHADDON SCHOOL AND   
 LYNWORTH SCHOOL. AT WHADDON SCHOOL    
 THERE ARE A LOT OF CHILDREN WHO LIVE  
 AROUND THE AREA WHO WOULD LIKE THIS,  
 ESPECIALLY THE ONES LIVING IN{CLYDE   
{CRESCENT}WHERE THE SCHOOL IS. THE BOYS
 CAN PLAY FOOTBALL BUT WE WOULD LIKE   
 SOME SWINGS FOR THE GIRLS AS WELL.
