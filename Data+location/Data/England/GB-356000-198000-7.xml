		<content> How we use our time.                  
 (written by Class 2, Woolaston )      
  Fifteen of our class walk to         
 school,six come by car and two come by
 school bus. We start at 9a.m. and     
 finish at 3.30p.m. with an hour for   
 dinner. We read, do maths, English,   
 geography, history, art and computers.
   Most of our dads travel to work by  
 car. Most cars leave the village      
 between 8 and 9 a.m. Their jobs are in
 engineering, shops, building, forestry
 and law and order. Some of our mums   
 also work in banking, catering,       
 teaching, cleaning and selling. All of
 our mums do the housework.            
   During our leisure time, we watch   
 T.V.,play with toys or on bikes, go   
 to Cubs on Monday evenings and the    
 girls go to Brownies on Wednesday     
 evenings.
