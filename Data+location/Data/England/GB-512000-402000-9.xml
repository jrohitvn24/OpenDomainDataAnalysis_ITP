		<title>09A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY a.m.</title>
		<content>    The day starts at 7.00am. After a  
 wash I change into my uniform. After  
 having breakfast and washing up I     
 watch 'Breakfast Time' a TV programme.
 It is soon time to leave for school.  
 The bus comes at about 8.45am.        
    I arrive at school in time for     
 registration, 8.55. The assembly lasts
 for about 25 minutes. On Fridays, the 
 whole school is in the hall. It is    
 quite crowded with many rows of chairs
 and benches. Our school is quite small
 with about 300 pupils. It is dark in  
 there, the electric lights give it a  
 yellow haze. I'm in the 4th year and  
 so I sit near the back, while the 1st 
 years are on the benches at the front.
 Following assembly we have Art and    
 after break, which lasts 15 minutes,  
 we have P.E. During Lunch Break we    
 often have games practises; these are 
 usually House or Year teams.          </content>
