		<content> Both the villages of Sheepy Magna and 
 Sibson are picturesque with a mixture 
 of old and new. Both villages have    
 established residents whose families  
 have lived in the area for years and a
 transient population, people who move 
 where their jobs dictate and live in  
 the area to take advantage of village 
 life.                                 
 Due to the lack of public transport   
 the villagers depend upon the use of  
 private cars and in some cases taxis  
 from nearby Atherstone.               
 Both villages have a Post Office/     
 General Stores, a Church and a        
 Public House serving food and drink.  
 Sibson also has a Hotel on the A444.  
 The pub is the focal point for people 
 to gather for relaxation and the      
 Atherstone Hunt and the North         
 Warwickshire Beagles meet there.
