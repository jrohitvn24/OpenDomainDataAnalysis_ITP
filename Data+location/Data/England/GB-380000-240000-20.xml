		<content> At 6.50 a.m I get up and get quietly  
 ready for school.At 8 o'clock I pack  
 my bag for a Tuesday,then off to catch
 the bus.This bus will take me for free
 straight to school, as long as I carry
 my pass.On the bus I sit on the back  
 seat,where we joke on the way to      
 school.Tuesday's a good day for my    
 class; having lessons like P.E.and    
 Metalwork.First,we're registered by   
 our form tutor and then to year       
 assembly.After this it's lessons,each 
 one lasting 35 minutes.In P.E.we do   
 cricket and athletics in the summer,  
 and football and rugby in the winter. 
 Everyone enjoys these lessons and we  
 shower at the end of them.At lunch    
 time there's a canteen for cooked     
 dinners or you can bring sandwiches.  
 Lunchtime lasts 50 minutes. We return 
 home by bus.At home I do my homework.
