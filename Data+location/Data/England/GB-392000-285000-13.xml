		<title>13BRIERLEY HILL GLASS CO. 01</title>
		<content> Mr Breese had l4 children.  One of the
 children was Terry's father.  Terry's 
 father worked at Stourbridge Glass    
 until World War 2 broke out and the   
 glass works closed because no one     
 could afford to buy glass. He was     
 given a job as a person mending planes
 in Wolverhampton.  During the war he  
 started to cut glass in his back      
 garden.  He used a motorbike engine to
 turn the wheel round.  Then he had a  
 decision to make; whether to go to    
 work for a big business or to set up  
 his own business.  The factory he     
 decided to buy was quite small and    
 cheap.  It was in Talbots Lane.  Mr   
 Breese is 77 now, he has Terry, 3     
 brothers, 2 sisters, 1 daughter_in_law
 all working in the company now.  It   
 started about thirty years ago as a   
 family concern and is still a local,  
 family business.                      </content>
