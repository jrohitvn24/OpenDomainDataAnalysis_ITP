		<title>05DIGSWELL HOUSE</title>
		<content> Early in the eighteenth century an old
 manor house stood to the west of the  
 present-day Digswell House.  It was   
 purchased in 1785 by George Nassau    
 Clavering Cowper but was demolished in
 1805.  The new mansion was built by   
 the Hon. Edward Spencer, who lived in 
 Digswell House for several years after
 its completion in 1806.  During the   
 first World War Digswell House served 
 as a hospital and nursing home for    
 wounded Australian Officers.  After   
 the war, the house was placed on the  
 market by Lord Desborough, the then   
 owner;  Sir Ebenezer Howard was the   
 buyer.  In the l950s a group of young 
 artists took possession and in 1959   
 Countess Mountbatten of Burma         
 officially opened Digswell House as an
 art centre which it remained until    
 1985 when Digswell House was sold.
