		<title>01 Our Square</title>
		<content>    The places we saw were very near   
 Milton Keynes.We looked at some farm  
crops and some housing estates which   
fringed part of our block.             
    There were cattle and sheep grazing
 on some of the land that we saw.      
    The Buckingham Road runs through   
 our squares, it acts as a link to the 
 city of Milton Keynes from the        
outlying villages.                     
   It is a pleasant, quiet area        
although it has a busy road running    
through it.While we were looking around
the area we saw fields of barley,      
wheat,corn and grazing land. In fact in
 Weazel Lane there were the remains of 
last years crop ,which was barley and  
alongside it this years crop of corn.
