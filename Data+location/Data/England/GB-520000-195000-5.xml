		<content> The most important road in our area is
 the A1. It is dual carriageway here   
 but many parts of it are motorway. We 
 did a traffic count for 15 minutes in 
 the mid morning of Thursday 23rd May  
 1985 and the results were: Northbound 
 302 vehicles and Southbound 315       
 vehicles. This means over 40 vehicles 
 use the road every minute!            
                                       
 When we looked at bus services in 4   
 square kilometres we were surprised to
 discover that 213,682 buses passed    
 through them in a year.  The transport
 manager who brought a bus to school   
 for us to look at said that a new bus 
 would cost between Â£60,000 and        
 Â£100,000.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
