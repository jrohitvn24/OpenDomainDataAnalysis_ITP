		<title>07INTERVIEW WITH A WORKER</title>
		<content> 9. What was it like to work there?{   
{It was quite messy, all my clothes    
{were covered in brick dust. The       
{atmosphere was friendly, and everyone 
{got on with each other. Parties and   
{trips were arranged for the children. 
{It was part of our life.}             
 10. How have conditions changed?      
{Conveyor belts now carry clay out of  
{the pits. Computers are used to sort  
{out financial problems. The main      
{difference is the kilns. They are  so 
{much safer and quicker.}              
 11. What do you think of reports      
 saying that the works are causing     
 damage and pollution?                 
{There is some pollution, yes, but only
{very little. I mean, most people in my
{area worked there and we are all here 
{today. There was not enough pollution 
{to damage your health. }
