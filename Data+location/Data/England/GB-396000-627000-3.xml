		<content> At the top of Church Street was       
 Winton's Stores(now Miller's antique  
 shop)an old established grocers.Below 
 was the temperance Hotel and nearby a 
 billiard hall was sited amidst the    
 reach of Good Templar's Hall and the  
 Rechabite Hall on Tenter Hill.        
 Dulhousie Place was named after one of
 the Lady Tankervilles(when Wooler     
 belonged to that family).             
     The Marble Arch,a large tenement  
 block was where the car-park is and   
 the adjoining well-founded Police     
 Station.Further down Church Street was
 a common lodging house(McLoughlin's)  
 where vagrants could buy a night's    
 lodging for a few coppers.            
     There were 5 churches in the town-
 3 Presbyterian,1 Church of England and
 1 Roman Catholic.Now there are just 3.
