		<title>13Origin of Chapel St.Leonards</title>
		<content> The Parish of Chapel St.Leonards was  
 part of the Parish of Mumby until the 
 closing years of the 19th century.    
 Mumby Church was the Parish Church    
 until a Chapel of Ease was erected to 
 serve the scattered community and     
 dedicated to St.Leonard - a French    
 Saint who gained popularity as patron 
 of prisoners.                         
 On November 7th 1895 the parish of    
 Chapel St.Leonards was constituted a  
 separate civil parish and legally     
 separated from the parish of Mumby cum
 Chapel by an order of the Lindsey     
 County Council and the order came into
 force on the 1st April 1896.
