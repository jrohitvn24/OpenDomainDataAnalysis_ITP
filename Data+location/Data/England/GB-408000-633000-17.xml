		<content> Mr Sprot went to Lucker School because
 it was a shorter walk from Adderstone 
 Mains.These small country schools have
 all closed and the children are now   
 transported into Belford.He started   
 school at the age of 5 and left aged  
 14 to work at Adderstone Farm with the
 "odd" horse (a horse working alone    
 rather than in a pair).There were 2   
 classes,the first for children up to  
 the age of 8.The teacher used a       
 leather belt to keep order and the    
 children had to sit at their desks    
 working during classtime.The toilets  
 were outside.There were no school     
 lunches.He carried sandwiches and tea 
 in a tin bottle which he warmed at    
 lunchtime by putting it next to a hot 
 stove.The children wrote with ink.    
 There were no toys,computers,         
 televisions or radios as we have in   
 school today.                         </content>
