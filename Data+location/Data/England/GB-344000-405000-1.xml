		<title>01OUR AREA _ SKELMERSDALE</title>
		<content>   Skelmersdale is a New Town built    
 around an old mining community. As you
 enter Skelmersdale you are surrounded 
 by countryside but when you arrive in 
 the town itself you see a mixture of  
 new housing estates,industrial areas  
 and the older mining houses.There are 
 lots of schools in the town,both      
 primary and comprehensive.Most of the 
 schools,like the houses,have been     
 built in the last 15 years.           
  There are also lots of open spaces   
 in and around the town.The main and   
 biggest one is the Trim Trail and     
 Tawd Valley. The 'River Tawd' flows   
 through the Trim Trail. At one time   
 Viking ships are said to have sailed  
 down it, but now it is no more        
 than 2 metres wide.                   
   Farmland and the tiny village of    
 Westhead make up the rest of this     
 Domesday block.                       </content>
