		<content> James and the Giant Peach is a        
 thrilling fantasy story written       
 by Roald Dahl.Youth Theatre Yorkshire 
 are presenting the musical at the     
 Theatre Royal in York and I am taking 
 part.To take part we all had to       
 audition at the Theatre Royal         
 itself.Two weeks after the audition   
 we all received a letter.Some people  
 didn't get through to the show,only   
 seventy children were picked.We go to 
 rehearsals twice a week.We have a     
 director,a producer and a             
 choreographer who spend a lot of time 
 with us.They are all very kind and    
 patient.The show starts on the 29th   
 June.It involves a lot of work and    
 patience.It has been mentioned a lot  
 in the newspapers and tickets sell    
 fast.There are lots of costumes and   
 we have special shoes.
