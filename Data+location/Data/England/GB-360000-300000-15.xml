 respected &amp; justly famous for his     
 unlimited energy in  promoting        
 numerous civic improvement schemes.His
 concern was to raise the quality of   
 life for local people: he started the 
 Agricultural Reading Society out of   
 which grew the Wenlock Olympian       
 Society with its annual Games a blend 
 of country sports,athletics &amp; cultural
 activities.                           
  From his efforts was built the Corn  
 Exchange &amp; Reading Rooms;  gas &amp; piped
 water were installed and the railway  
 was brought to Much Wenlock.          
  His belief in sport as a civilising  
 influence &amp; admiration for classical  
 Greece led him to campaign inter -    
 nationally for a modern Olympics. He  
 died just prior 1st.modern Olympiad.  </content>
