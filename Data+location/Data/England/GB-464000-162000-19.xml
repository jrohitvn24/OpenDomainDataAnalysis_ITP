		<content> My favourite toy:-"I got my best toy  
 the day after I was born. When I was  
 old enough I named it panda because it
 was a panda. I hold him with my left  
 hand while I suck my thumb with my    
 right hand and smell his ear. He is   
 very, very dirty and his head will    
 soon come off. He got so thin Mummy   
 had to knit him a jumper so he        
 wouldn't fall apart. He used to be    
 furry but the fur fell off. He is in  
 lots of Dads photo albums. I take him 
 to bed every night. He was the first  
 toy I ever got."                      
 Many children have large collections  
 of tin badges, often with slogans:-   
 'Mrs. X rules O.K.' or place names:-  
 'Bekonscot Model Village',or T.V.     
 characters,e.g. Bugs Bunny.           
 Key rings and novelty erasers are also
 popular collectors' items.
