		<title>14TRAFFIC SURVEY ON THE A64</title>
		<content>      We carried out a traffic survey  
 on the A64 York to Scarborough road   
 near Hopgrove roundabout,on a Monday  
 afternoon in July 1985.               
      In one hour a total of 669       
 vehicles passed our census point      
 travelling in an Easterly direction   
 whilst 378 vehicles travelled in a    
 Westerly direction.This is very       
 surprising because at that time of the
 day (between 4 and 5pm) we would have 
 thought most traffic would be         
 returning from the coast rather than  
 travelling towards it.                
       Here are our results of the     
 eastbound survey:-                    
 BUSES 5 TRACTORS 8 VANS 52 AMBULANCE 3
 LORRIES 64 MOTOR BIKES 12 ARMY V'CLE 5
 CYCLES 0 CARAVANS 4 CARS 516 TOTAL 669
     77% of the vehicles were cars.
