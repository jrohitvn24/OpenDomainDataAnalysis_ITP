  The falling school rolls in          
 Shirebrook have resulted in the       
 amalgamation of a junior and infant   
 in 1984. Because the emptied school   
 was so close to the centre of         
 Shirebrook and of such useful         
 dimensions it was converted into a    
 community centre and a youth training 
 workshop. On visiting the workshop we 
 found that up to 50 unemployed        
 teenagers are being given a year's    
 training in one of the following      
 subjects - Sewing, Furniture repairs, 
 Upholstery, Joinery and Metalwork.    
 Most of the students find a permanent 
 job at the end of the course. There   
 are 10 full-time professional         
 instuctor.                            
   J.SINGLETON, J.DYSON, S.COULTON.
