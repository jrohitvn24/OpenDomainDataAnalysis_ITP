		<content> There were 7 or 8 teachers in the     
 school and Mrs Tate clearly remembered
 her headmaster Mr. "Gaffer" Jones, who
 was a good teacher. She told the story
 of him chasing one of the Warrenby    
 boys over desks with his cane! You got
 the cane for many things including    
 being late.                           
                                       
 There was no uniform but the majority 
 of the girls wore white pinafores.    
 Writing was done on slate boards with 
 slate pencils. They always tried to   
 get the sharpest pencil and the       
 cleanest slates. Grooves can still be 
 seen in the stone work where this     
 happened.                             
                                       
 When Mrs Tate arrived at the school   
 she was able to read so she had to    
 teach the Warrenby boys how to read.
