		<title>17The River Medway</title>
		<content>   The River Medway is the chief river 
 of Kent and is about 110km.long.As    
 far up-stream as Snodland there is    
 plenty of water mid-stream even at low
 tide.The stretch of water between     
 Halling on the west bank and Wouldham 
 on the east bank meanders between     
 muddy banks,widening at Burham.The    
 marshy ground attracts interesting    
 bird-life.                            
   On the banks there are cement       
 factories and the remains of old ones.
 From prehistoric times this stretch of
 the river has been used for the       
 transportation of heavy loads.In the  
 eighteenth century smuggling was an   
 important pastime.Goods carried       
 included spirits,wine,tea,tobacco and 
 raisins.There are rumours of secret   
 tunnels on both sides of the river.   
   Until the Second World War Spritsail
 barges were used for trade purposes.  </content>
