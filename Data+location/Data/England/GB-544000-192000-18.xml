		<title>18CHIGWELL ROW WATERWORKS</title>
		<content>    The Chigwell Row Waterworks is run 
 by the Essex Water Company.           
                                       
   The untreated water mainly comes    
 from Chingford Reservoir.  The water  
 comes in as dirty water and is treated
 with two chemicals one called Chlorine
 which cleans the water and the other  
 is Ammonia which is a stabiliser for  
 the Chlorine.                         
   The water is also filtered.   The   
 filterbeds have about two feet of sand
 at the bottom.This is at the bottom so
 that all the Algae and dirt stays at  
 the bottom and the clean water goes to
 the chemical tanks where Chlorine and 
 Ammonia is added.                     
   When the water is clean it goes to  
 parts of Ilford, Dagenham, Barking,   
 Romford, Hornchurch and as far as     
 Tilbury.
