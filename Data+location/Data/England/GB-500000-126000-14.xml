		<title>14The Doctors' Surgery.</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
    The main doctors' surgery is       
 in Petworth. The surgery has got four 
 doctors who are called Doctor Lyon,   
 Doctor Morgan, Doctor Lee and Doctor  
 Bell. In Kirdford there is a village  
 call office in which every Wednesday  
 a doctor comes with no one else       
 unless he has student doctors         
 with him. The official time  which he 
 is allowed to stay is one hour. There 
 is no chemist in Kirdford so a van    
 comes from Petworth Surgery about five
 miles from Kirdford and drops         
 off the medicines which have          
 been prescribed by the doctors. The   
 people then come to collect them and  
 take them home. A Health Visitor comes
 to the Village Hall on Monday         
 afternoons.                           
                                       </content>
