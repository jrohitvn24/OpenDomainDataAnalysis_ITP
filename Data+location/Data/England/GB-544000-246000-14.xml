		<content> When we went to the farm we saw a     
 combine harvester. It works by cutting
 the corn and forces it into the drum  
 inside the combine which spins round  
 very quickly and separates the corn   
 seed and the straw. Then the grain    
 comes out of a tube at the side of the
 combine into the trailer. We were     
 amazed at the size of the combine     
 harvester and how high up it is       
 sitting on the seat. We have also seen
 the sprayer and the seed drill. This  
 is how the sprayer works: first the   
 fertiliser is poured into it. Then it 
 is blown around by a large fan. The   
 fertiliser shoots out of pipes onto   
 the crops.  Tis is how the seed drill 
 works: you put the sed in, then fasten
 the drill to a tractor. As you drive  
 along the field the seeds fall down   
 pipes into the soil.
