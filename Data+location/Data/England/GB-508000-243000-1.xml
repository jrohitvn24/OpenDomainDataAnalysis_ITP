		<content> Situated about 2 miles S.E. of Bedford
 this block is covered predominently by
 agricultural land and apart from one  
 or two farms, housing is only to be   
 found in Cotton End, at the top N.E.  
 corner, with a little residential     
 accommodation just south of this in   
 Herrings Green. It is virtually a     
 suburb of Bedford with a population of
 around 1600.  Cotton End has a Church,
 School, Post Office, Village Hall,    
 W.I., and football team.  The         
 attractive countryside, mainly flat   
 apart from a high ridge running across
 from N.E. to S.W., boasts a nature    
 reserve and many lovely walks.        
 Although not in the block the presence
 of adjacent R.A.F. Cardington, just   
 north of Cotton End, is hard to       
 escape.  Its huge hangers and large   
 silent airships overhang and dominate 
 the landscape to the north.           </content>
