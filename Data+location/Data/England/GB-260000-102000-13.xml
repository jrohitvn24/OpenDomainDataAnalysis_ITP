		<content> The nearest Police Station is in      
 Okehampton. A police car is driven    
 round the village about once a week.  
 There is a Community Policeman who is 
 a liason between the school,the       
 village and the Police.               
     He visits the school to talk about
 road safety,not going with strangers, 
 etc.                                  
     There is no vandalism or crime    
 here,just perhaps a bit of apple      
 scrumping in the Autumn.              
      Nobody bothers locking cars or   
 houses,we feel quite safe walking at  
 night,even with no street lights.     
       The problems of big cities are  
 completely alien to us.               
   However,we have to take the school  
 computer home in the holidays as small
 schools are regularly broken into,by  
 people coming into the area.
