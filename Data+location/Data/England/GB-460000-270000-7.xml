The cycle proficiency test is a test   
to help children learn road safety. The
test is done in school. A policeman,   
P.C.Burns, comes into school to teach  
road safety to the third year children.
It is taken each year.                 
The children take the test so that they
can ride their bicycles on the road.   
They are taught how to turn left and   
right. They learn where to ride on the 
road. They also learn how to do hand   
signals, that they should not ride in  
the middle of the road, and that they  
should not do wheelies. It is important
to keep bicycles clean and to check the
brakes, the chain, and the wheel nuts. 
This year nine children were successful
in the test.
