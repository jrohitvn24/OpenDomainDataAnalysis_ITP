		<title>06Stock Farming - Gunton</title>
		<content> The amount of land laid down to       
pasture has declined in recent years   
although an area of approximately 80   
acres has been relaid in the Gunton    
Hall Park. Intensive livestock farming 
of pigs and beef cattle is frequently  
combined with arable farming.          
 Pig-breeding on a moderate scale is   
also undertaken. A herd of 80 cows is  
the only one kept for dairying         
purposes. With the increased           
automation of many of the farming      
methods employment oppotunities are    
small, although seasonal casual        
employment is offered.                 
 Within Gunton Park Dairy Farm, the    
only part of the old Gunton Estate     
still owned by the Hardbord Family is  
let to a local farmer.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
