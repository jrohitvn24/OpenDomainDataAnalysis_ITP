		<title>07CANAL WALK GREENFORD</title>
		<content>{Canal Walk}9th July 1985 (5km long).  
 We walked westwards.  On the right was
 open grassland and{Horsenden Hill. }To
 the left was{Perivale Woods}with its  
 lovely nature trails.  A sports       
 ground now stands on the right with   
 the new huge IBM Computer company on  
 the left.  Going under the Greenford  
 Road bridge we saw an{Industrial      
{Estate}on both sides.  We could smell 
 the Mothers Pride bakery and saw the  
 private inlets and wharves once used  
 for loading. The came the Black Horse 
 pub with its summer garden and the    
 busy railway line into the City.      
 Still more factories and 40 assorted  
 boats and barges could be seen        
 next. Finally going under the A40 we  
 saw 1 holiday boat cruising, 2        
 walkers, 1 jogger, 6 anglers and 35   
 ducks.  We{hope}that people will{enjoy
 and{maintain}this{towpath walk.       </content>
