     My house is a new semi-detached at
28,Eddison Road,Coton Fields,Stafford. 
We have three bedrooms and they are all
upstairs. We have one big garden and   
one small garden. The front garden is  
small and the back garden is big. We   
have two toilets, one is upstairs and  
one is downstairs.                     
     I sleep in the back bedroom and my
brother sleeps  in a front bedroom.    
I have to go across the landing to get 
to the toilet.                         
     I like my house because it is big 
and there is alot of room to play.     
     Sometimes our street is noisy when
groups of older children play outside  
on their B.M.X.bikes.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
