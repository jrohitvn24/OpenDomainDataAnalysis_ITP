		<content> THE AREA THAT THIS BLOCK COMPRISES    
 USED TO BE MARSHY. IN THE PAST,DRAINS 
 HAVE BEEN DUG ,AND LARGE DITCHES      
 CALLED RHYNES HAVE FILLED WITH WATER  
 TO MAKE THE LAND USEABLE.THE FIELDS   
 ARE USED MAINLY FOR GRAZING.THE FIELDS
 ARE SMALL AND OWNED INDIVIDUALLY BY   
 DIFFERENT FARMERS.FEW FARMERS HAVE    
 MORE THAN ONE OR TWO FIELDS TOGETHER, 
 BUT OWN OR RENT FIELDS SCATTERED ALL  
 OVER THE BLOCK.THIS MEANS THAT THE    
 FARMERS HAVE TO MOVE THEIR  HERDS     
 QUITE  LONG DISTANCES,ALONG DROVES    
 WHICH ARE TRACKS BETWEEN FIELDS AND   
 ALONG THE ROADS AND LANES.MANY OF THE 
 FARMS THAT USED TO EXIST AS WORKING   
 UNITS NO LONGER EXIST EXCEPT IN NAME  
 ONLY AND ARE NOW PRIVATE DWELLINGS    
 THE LAND BEING USED BY FEWER FARMERS.
