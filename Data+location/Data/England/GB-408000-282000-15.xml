		<title>15A Day in My Life     B'ham</title>
		<content>My dad wakes me in the morning when he 
returns from his night shift at Lucas's
where they make batteries for motor    
cars. Even though it is early many     
noises tell me the day has begun. The  
rush hour traffic, the sparrows        
chirping and next door's dog barking.  
I can hear mum getting my cereal ready 
for breakfast with our local radio     
station BRMB blaring through the house.
After I have washed I dress for school 
in my blue uniform. As we leave the    
house the city traffic fills the air   
with noise and fumes. Mum hurries my   
little brother as she see's the number 
31 bus coming down the road. Mum shows 
the driver her bus pass and puts       
22pence into the ticket machine for us.
We sit together downstairs because     
although you can see more on the top   
deck people smoke and the smell makes  
you feel sick.                         </content>
