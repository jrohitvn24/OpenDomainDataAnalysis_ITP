		<title>10HAM LANDS</title>
		<content>   {Ham Lands }is an area              
 of uncultivated grassland.It is       
 bordered by the Wates estate, the     
 River Thames,Teddington footbridge and
 the Thames Young Mariners.Until 1900  
 the land was farmed.From 1990-1950 it 
 was a gravel pit. It was then filled  
 in with rubbish from all around       
 London and covered with top soil from 
 Buckinghamshire.                      
    Ham Lands today is grassland with  
 tall trees like ash, sycamore,        
 horse-chestnut,oak,willow and poplar  
 and bushes like hawthorn, blackthorn, 
 blackberry and wild rose.There are    
 many different types of flowers,birds 
 and insects.There are also foxes and  
 badgers.Richmond Council looks after  
 the land by cutting the grass once a  
 year and by providing paths.
