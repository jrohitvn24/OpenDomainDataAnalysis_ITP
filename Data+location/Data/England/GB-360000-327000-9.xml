		<title>09THE LYON MEMORIAL HALL</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Margaret Powell came to see us 
 about the{Lyon Hall}for our Domesday  
 Project.   Many schools (about 13,000)
 have done this project.               
 The{Lyon Hall}is a red brick building 
 which stands at the side of the A53,  
 opposite the Hearne Lane.  It is the  
 main meeting place of the village of  
 Hodnet.  Mrs. Powell told us about the
 activities that go on in the{Lyon Hall
 Many things are held there such as the
 Gardening Club for older people,      
 dancing for young people, Discos, the 
 School Speech Day, The School Concert,
 Private Parties and Meetings.         
{The Lyon Hall}was named after Dr. Lyon
 when he died. His wife, Mrs Lyon, laid
 the foundation stone in 1913.         
 In 1983 a new extension was added and 
 opened by the MP for Oswestry, Mr.    
 John Biffen.
