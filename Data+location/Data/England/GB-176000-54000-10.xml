		<title>10Rose Village Community</title>
		<content> Rose is a small village with a very   
 small population.It is in between     
 Goonhavern and Perranporth.The people 
 of the village get together and write 
 a newsletter.There is a committee to  
 arrange various activities for the    
 local folk.They have an A.G.M. once a 
 year.The Men's Institute hold a Fun   
 Nite each year.This year they had a   
 genuine home-made pasty section on    
 their "Home Produce" stall.There was  
 a baking day for the ladies.There is  
 also a Sunday School for the children 
 with a different theme each week.In   
 the chapel they have concerts in the  
 evenings as well as regular services. 
 They write all sorts of news in the   
 newsletter which is monthly.For       
 instance if someone leaves the village
 they mention it (eg.joining the Army).
 Even a cuckcoo in a nest can get a    
 mention!                              </content>
