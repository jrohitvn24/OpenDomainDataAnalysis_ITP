		<content> I ran to the ducks with bread in my   
 hands.                                
 I saw a man with old wrinkled hands.  
 He was feeding the ducks all alone.   
 I ran to the man with the old wrinkled
                                  hands
 and talked about lambs                
 and we looked at the land.            
 I saw the fields with the sunset      
                       behind them     
 and then I saw the ducklings.         
 I saw ducks awake and some ducks      
                             asleep    
 and some ducklings following their    
                             mother.   
 The old man had gone home,            
 and I was all alone                   
 Then it started to get misty.         
 It was a lush pink colour             
 and it was as though I was in         
                      charmed land.
