		<title>10ECOLOGY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> The area flourishes with wildlife.    
 One can see many, now relatively rare 
 wild flowers, in abundant patches     
 throughout the area: cowslips,        
 primroses, bluebells, orchids, and    
 harebells. In the Autumn you can      
 collect sloes, hazel nuts, mushrooms  
 elderberries and blackberries.Evidence
 of badgers, foxes, deer, rabbits and  
 grey squirrels are found regularly.   
 A pair of grey squirrels are daily    
 visitors to the school grounds where  
 there are many lime trees for them to 
 play and hid in. They have a dray in a
 nearby garden and recently two baby   
 squirrels were seen in the playground.
 Sparrow hawks are a frequent          
 silhouetted over head.  House martins 
 return each year to nest under the    
 eaves of the school roof.  Owls hoot  
 in the evening and cuckoos are heard  
 every spring.                         </content>
