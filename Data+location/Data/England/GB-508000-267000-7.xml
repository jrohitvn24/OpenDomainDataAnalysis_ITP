		<title>07Kimbolton - Traffic</title>
		<content>    Older residents remember playing in
 the wide High Street as children and  
 being scarcely disturbed by the three 
 or four vehicles that passed through  
 each day.  Now their grandchildren    
 have difficulty even crossing the same
 road. The traffic flow is forecast to 
 continue growing until the{A1/M1 link}
 road becomes effectively Kimbolton's  
 by-pass.                              
    A minor country road is serving as 
 a major trunk road for{Common Market} 
 container vehicles. The problem is    
 exacerbated by the narrow right-angle 
 corners with which C12 town planners  
 funnelled medieval traffic through    
 the market place for toll charges.    
    The result of this is mortal danger
 to pedestrians; damage by vibration   
 and impact to listed buildings; and   
 erosion by air pollution and noise for
 residents in general.                 </content>
