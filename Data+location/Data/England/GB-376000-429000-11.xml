		<title>11THE NEW BY-PASS - 1985</title>
		<content>      A lot of local quarries were used
 to construct the motorway that        
 by-passes Accrington.  It starts at   
{Burnley Road} and finishes near {     
{Haslingden.}On May 17th 1985 there was
{a Fun Run} along the motorway when    
 there was no traffic of course.  The  
 distance was about seven miles and I  
 finished in about forty minutes.  I   
 also came in amongst the first fifty  
 and there were adults running         
 including my elder brother.  I beat   
 him too.  Altogether there were about 
 7OO running in the race.  They played 
 the theme music from a film of the    
 Olympic Games called{"Chariots of     
{Fire"}at the beginning of the race.  I
 entered another race{up the Coppice}  
 and across to the Motorway and was    
 sponsored.  This meant that I raised  
 Â£3O for the{Famine in  Ethiopia.}
