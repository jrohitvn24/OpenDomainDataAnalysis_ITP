		<content>  Known as Belgebi in the original     
 Domesday survey, Bellerby is situated 
 on the A6108 2 miles from Leyburn and 
 9 miles from Richmond.The surrounding 
 area is mainly agricultural. The land 
 to the north and north west of the    
 village is mainly moorland or rough   
 grassland and the greater part of it  
 is used by the Ministry of Defence as 
 firing ranges and local farmers for   
 the grazing of sheep.                 
  The village has a population of about
 300 and supports an Anglican church, a
 Methodist chapel, a pub, a shop, a    
 post office, a village hall and a tea 
 shop. The village school closed on    
 July 19th. 1985.                      
  There is no large single employer at 
 all in this area. The greatest number 
 of people work on the land or have    
 jobs in nearby Leyburn.               
  Tourism is quite important.          </content>
