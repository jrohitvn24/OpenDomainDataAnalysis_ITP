		<content>   J.D.R fabrications make glass fibre 
musical instrument cases. The three men
who work there design and make the     
cases. They make the moulds, cases,    
line the cases, paint them and put on  
the handles. They make cases for       
saxophones, cellos, violins, guitars   
and many other instruments. Cello cases
are exported to Australia and saxophone
cases to Sweden. The cases are sold and
delivered all over the British Isles.  
Gun Safe make cabinets to keep sporting
guns and ammunition safe. They have a  
caravan which they take to game fairs  
to sell their equipment. They export   
all over the world and also sell their 
cabinets privately. Photographic       
Processing is run by Mr.Kirkwood. He   
develops photographs, etc. which are   
sent all over the world. Mr.A.Thompson 
restores every make of car and his     
customers are mainly local.            </content>
