		<title>01CULWORTH AND SURROUNDINGS</title>
		<content>This area is exclusively rural with    
gently rolling hills and landscape     
dominated by green fields,hedges and   
trees.                                 
     {The main residential area is the 
village of Culworth}which is served by 
a few shops,1 pub,1 church,1 school and
agricultural craftsmen.It is a typical 
Northamptonshire village with buildings
of mellow stone extending from the     
village green. The whole area is       
quiet and peaceful despite occasional  
American jets zooming overhead from the
local base.                            
      The surrounding farmland is      
predominantly arable with grazing for  
sheep and some cattle.                 
      Public transport is limited but  
the majority of families possess at    
least one car.There is very little     
unemployment.The main shopping centre  
for inhabitants is Banbury.            </content>
