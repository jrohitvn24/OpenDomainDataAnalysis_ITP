		<content>This little village of about 16 houses 
is situated on the edge of Otmoor on   
the Western side close to the New River
Ray, a man made cut.                   
    There is a manor house,a garage    
run by a Mr Franklin (very much a local
name)who not only undertakes repairs   
but also sells petrol,and a small      
church.One of the inhabitants,a Mr     
Rawlins,has an observatory in his      
garden.There are several farms in the  
area,all based on the village.In the   
churchyard there lies buried a Maori   
Princess called Papakura who was       
married to one of the local gentry and 
lived at Oddington Grange nearby. She  
caused a memorial to be erected inside 
the church to the Maori dead of the    
1914-18 war.The memorial was carved in 
New Zealand by Maori craftsmen and     
stands in the church to this day.
