		<content>    Heritage Farm is being set up just 
 next door to our school at Clough     
 Head.                                 
    The Colne Valley Heritage Farm is  
 to provide opportunities for all      
 members of the community - young and  
 old volunteers, and unemployed, to    
 work together and to pass on the old  
 crafts and skills to the next         
 generation.                           
    It is hoped to raise enough money  
 to buy or rent enough land to put up  
 suitable buildings to house an ever   
 growing collection of exhibits.       
    We have been to the farm to see Ben
 the horse being shod by the           
 blacksmith.                           
    We also saw the two drover's       
 caravans and the three calves that are
 still very small.                     
                                       
                                       </content>
