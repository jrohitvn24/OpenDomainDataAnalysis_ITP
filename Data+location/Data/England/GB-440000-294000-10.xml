 On Tuesday 25th June I woke up at     
 0750. I had cornflakes and a slice of 
 toast for breakfast and then came to  
 school in the car with my friend      
 Richard.                              
   At school we made arrangments       
 for sports day. I am in the sack      
 race. Later we rehearsed our service  
 for our class assembly on Friday.     
   After school I went in the car to   
 the stables where I keep my pony .    
   When I got there I groomed my       
 pony 'Magic' and then I had a riding  
 lesson. Then we went home and I had my
 dinner, after which I watched tv for  
 an hour or so then went to bed.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
