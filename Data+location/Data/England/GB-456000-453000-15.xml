		<title>15Clifton Library</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mrs Ibbotson one of the
 Librarians at Clifton Library. In the 
 Library there are 18,500 books and    
 every year about 90,000 books are     
 borrowed. There are 3 librarians in   
 charge of 8 local libraries including 
 this one and the one at Clifton       
 Hospital. The librarians work in      
 teams. Our Library was built in 1969  
 when it formed part of the North      
 Riding County Library. As well as     
 adult and junior fiction and          
 non-fiction there are reference books.
 There are special books for blind     
 children, these have a raised pattern 
 for the child to follow with its      
 fingers. The library has books with   
 large print for people with bad       
 eye-sight. Many more borrowers are    
 expected soon from the new housing    
 estates close by on the airfield.
