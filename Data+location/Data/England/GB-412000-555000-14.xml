		<title>14GAMES IN THE DERWENT VALLEY</title>
		<content>   Here are some of the games played by
 local children in their school yard or
 at home in the evening: British       
 Bulldog, Cannon Kings, Man the ship,  
 Tuggy on high, Space Invaders, Blocky,
 Hopscotch, Polo, Donkey, rounders,    
 tennis, cricket, football and stilts. 
           Space Invaders              
   When playing Space Invaders you have
 to avoid the ball which is being      
 thrown above your head while moving   
 along a wall; the ball gets gradually 
 lower until you have to dodge it to   
 avoid getting hit and being out. All  
 you need to play is a high wall and a 
 tennis ball. Any number can play. The 
 rules are that the thrower must not   
 stand too close to the people. The    
 ball must be thrown well above the    
 heads of the group. Anyone hit is out.
