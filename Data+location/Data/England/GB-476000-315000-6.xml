		<title>06RECENT HISTORY BURTON LAZARS</title>
		<content> Burton Lazars is a village of around  
 250 inhabitants situated about a mile 
 and a half from the centre of Melton  
 Mowbray.                              
        In local history the earliest  
 references to the village are in the  
 Domesday Book when the village was    
 then called Burtone.The lazars was    
 added several hundred years after the 
 Domesday book when a Leper colony was 
 established in the village. The       
 earthworks of the Leper hospital can  
 still be seen on farm land to the west
 of the village. During the last 100   
 years a racecourse was built on the   
 south side of the village and very    
 popular steeplechase events were held 
 up to 1939.The races were attended by 
 royalty such as Edward Prince of Wales
 and the Duke of Gloucester.Royalty    
 used to stay overnight in the village.
