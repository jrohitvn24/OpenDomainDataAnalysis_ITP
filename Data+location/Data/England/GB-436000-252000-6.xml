 A plant which is quite common here is 
 the primrose.It is a small yellow or  
 purple flower.It has five petals in   
 each petal a notch.They have big broad
 leaves.Lichen is quite common around  
 here but it is not common in large    
 towns.They can not survive because of 
 the air pollution and sooty           
 atmosphere.Lichen lives on rocks and  
 stones.A common tree around here is   
 the horse chestnut.They have big broad
 leaves that are joined together in    
 groups of 5_7 leaves.The flower of the
 tree flowers in May and is usally     
 white or pink.The fruit of this is the
 conker(not edible).
