 after a former mayor.The entry fee is 
 15p.First they have a jumble sale,an

 to raise money.Then the people talk   
 about old times mostly over a cup of  
 tea sometimes a visitor comes to give 
 a talk.Then they have games of{Bingo} 
 played for prizes of food.Buttons are 
 used for markers so the cards can be
