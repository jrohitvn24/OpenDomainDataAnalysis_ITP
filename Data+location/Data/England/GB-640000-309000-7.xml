		<content> GREAT YARMOUTH.NATURALLY MANY MARKET  
 TRADERS ARE PREDICTING A DECLINE IN   
 ATTENDANCES WITH THE OPENING OF THE   
 PROPOSED BY-PASS.                     
 ACLE MARKET CANNOT HOPE TO COMPETE    
 WITH THE LARGER AND MORE MODERN       
 SITES AT YARMOUTH AND NORWICH,BUT,    
 RATHER,ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A MORE     
 GENUINE SERVICE FOR THE COMMUNITY.    
 AS ONE STALL-HOLDER COMMENTED:        
 "WE SELL JUNK,THEY SELL ANTIQUES,BUT  
 THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE IS THEY      
 CHARGE MORE!"                         
 MOST HOUSEWIVES IN ACLE PREFER TO     
 BUY GROCERIES ON THE MARKET,NOT       
 BECAUSE THEY ARE ANY BETTER OR ANY    
 CHEAPER, BUT RATHER BECAUSE BY DOING  
 SO THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET THEIR   
 FRIENDS,AND BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT BY 
 USING THE MARKET THEY ARE SUPPORTING  
 LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSMEN.
