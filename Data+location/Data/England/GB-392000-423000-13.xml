		<title>13Conservation</title>
		<content>    The people of Todmorden are proud  
 of their heretage and want to conserve
 all the things that give the area a   
 special identity.Conservation means   
 the considered control and enhancement
 of the inherent character of an area. 
 In effect it means trying to protect  
 features that have made an area an    
 attractive place to work and live.    
   In the south-east corner of our     
 survey area lies the village of       
 Lumbutts.It is only small, but was    
 once more important than Todmorden,   
 because it was on a packhorse route.It
 is situated on a plateau at a height  
 of 600-700 feet.All the houses are    
 made of Millstone Grit and have       
 low-pitched, stone roofs.The windows  
 are small, square or stone mullioned. 
 Inside the beamed ceilings and stone  
 slab floors add to the character of   
 the building.Slide 'C' shows Lumbutts.</content>
