		<title>10Wirral Talking Newspaper</title>
		<content>   Our  first  year  group  visited the
 recording studios, and  talked  to the
 organisers and  sat in on  a recording
 session. The Talking  Newspaper is for
 the blind. Editors collect  news items
 on Thursday  morning  from  the Wirral
 News paper. On Thursday  evening these
 are put on to a tape  at The Christian
 Centre (former Childrens Hospital).   
   The recording studio has two rooms. 
 Two people deal with recording clarity
 and  volume .In  another  room  is  a 
 presenter and four readers at a table.
 In front of each reader are news items
   Near each reader are three lights - 
 red,yellow,green -telling them when to
 read or stop.When the readers approach
 the end of their paragraphs  they  put
 up their hand and the next gets ready.
 We had to keep totally silent while we
 listened to them.
