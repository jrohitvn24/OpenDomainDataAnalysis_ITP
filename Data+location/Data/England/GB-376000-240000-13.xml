		<title>13LITTLE MALVERN FARMS</title>
		<content> Farming in the area is dominated by   
 the amalgamation of 6 farms covering  
 900 acres with their administrative   
 centre at{Wood Farm.}Land use is      
 mainly{grassland}much of it in 5 year 
 leys for 300 milk cows and 400 young  
 cattle. 300 sheep owned by nearby     
 farmers also graze the land. Involved 
 in the amalgamation was large capital 
 expenditure on buildings and a network
 of roads. Some{hedges were removed}in 
 1977 but a few are being replanted.   
 The whole dairying operation is{highly
{mechanised}with 5 tractors and only 7 
 employees. Milk is collected in       
 tankers by the Milk Marketing Board.  
{Markets}for beef cattle are Worcester,
 Gloucester, Kidderminster and Ledbury.
 Amalgamation has left some farmhouses 
 empty - these are being converted into
 ordinary dwellings or, as at{Danemoor 
{Farm,}into luxury flats.              </content>
