 each year on the village green. It was
 started in the mid 1970's to raise    
 some of the money needed to build the 
 village hall.                         
                                       
 The school,clubs and other groups all 
 participate to have fun and to raise  
 funds for the upkeep of the hall.     
                                       
 There are a variety of side-shows,    
 fancy dress competitions, arena       
 events, a Punch and Judy show,        
 refreshments, a dog show, pony rides  
 and a flower show.There are also      
 demonstrations of arts and crafts with
 perhaps a chance to try them out.     
                                       
 There are also opportunities to buy   
 local produce, plants and home-made   
 cakes.
