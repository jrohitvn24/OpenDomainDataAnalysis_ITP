 My favourite hobby is riding my horse.
 In the morning I go down to the farm  
 to clean and groom my horse. His name 
 is Mr. Pickwick. I call him Pick or   
 Pickwick for short. He is 12.2 hands  
 high. He is all brown with four white 
 feet and a white blaze on his head.   
 After school everyday I go down and   
 ride him. Right now I am only just    
 learning to ride him. I have ridden   
 him once down to my house and back,   
 which is about three quarters of a    
 mile. I have also jumped him once but 
 that is it.
