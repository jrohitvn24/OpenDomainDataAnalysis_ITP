   The most common tree is the         
{chestnut.}The other trees are{oak, ash
 and{hazel.}Some trees have been pulled
 down by{old man's beard}and{honey     
{suckle.                               
   In the spring when we first entered 
 the wood it was very green. As we     
 climbed the hill we found carpets of  
{bluebells}which smelt beautiful. There
 were patches of{celandines, ground ivy
 and{pink campions;}later in the year  
{bracken}grows over the ground.        
   We saw an{adder}on a pile of leaves 
 and bracken; when it saw us it stayed 
 very still and then slithered away    
 very, very slowly. We also saw a{slow-
{worm,}which was at the side of the    
 path in the shade, but when it heard  
 us it moved away slowly.
