		<title>02UP HATHERLEY FARM,CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> Up Hatherley Farm is nearly surrounded
 by houses,fields and a lane called    
 Greatfield Lane.                      
  In this farm there are three         
 ponds but soon the ponds will be dried
 up.The tadpoles will die but people   
 have fished some tadpoles out of the  
 ponds to save them.The tadpoles are in
 one of the ponds,in the other two     
 ponds there are newts and there are a 
 few great-crested newts.The newts will
 not die because they will burrow into 
 the ground or travel to a nearby pond.
 the calves have been born and they    
 seem to be very hungry.The farmer     
 keeps a lot of hens,chickens and the  
 115 eggs that they lay he sells.The   
 farmer won't let us go into the farm  
 when the cows are outside.In a few    
 years time it won't be a farm,it will 
 be houses.
