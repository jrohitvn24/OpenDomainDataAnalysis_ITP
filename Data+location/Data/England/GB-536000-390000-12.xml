		<title>12RIVER LUD AND LOUTH CANAL</title>
		<content> The River Lud runs between Alvingham  
 and North Cockerington.It rises in the
 Wolds to the west at Withcall and     
 flows into the sea to the North-East  
 at Tetney.                            
 The Louth Navigation Canal which runs 
 almost parallel to the Lud dates back 
 to 1765. Teams of Irish "Navies" dug  
 the eleven miles from the sea-lock at 
 Tetney to Louth with only hand tools. 
 Two years into the project, funds ran 
 low and a further Â£14,000 had to be   
 raised for the canal to be completed. 
 It was opened on May 20th 1770.       
 Sadly the canal fell into disrepair   
 after the Louth Flood of 1920 but a   
 unique feature is still visible near  
 Alvingham,this is one of the seven    
 "Bell Chambered" locks,designed as was
 the entire canal by John Grundy.This  
 was the first canal to use this type  
 of lock.                              </content>
