		<content>   {Mr.G.Wilde }believes life is easier
 now than  it  was  60 years  ago.  For
 instance,  aeronautical engineers have
 made it  possible  for  people  of the
 world  to  travel  cheaply.  He enjoys
 renovating  vintage  cars.We know that
 both  Mr. Wilde and  his father before
 him  will  enter the  history books as
 extraordinary   engineers.            
   {Mr.T.Yates} was born in Windley.His
 father  won  many  prizes  for   Shire
 horses but he believes he has now  won
 more than he did.He is a  very  modest
 man but has in  fact  met  most of the
 Royal  Family  at  some time or other.
   {Mrs.M.Wagstaff }has  lived  in this
 village for over 40 years  and   seems
 as active now as she was then.When she
 is not playing the organ  in Turnditch
 Church or elsewhere she  may  be doing
 some work at  the  School,  housework,
 crochet,knitting,cooking or gardening.</content>
