		<content>  The area we are covering is several  
 miles due east of{Hereford}and was    
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book of 1086.                         
  It is now predominantly a{farming    
{area,}famous for its hops. The main   
 physical features are Shucknall hill &amp;
 Backbury hill, which dominate the low-
 lying Frome valley which holds the    
 most fertile farming land.            
  There are 5 main villages: Bartestree
 ,Weston Beggard,Shucknall,Dormington &amp;
 Withington, all lying on the slopes of
 the various hills around the river.   
 Many buildings are old timber or      
 "black and white" houses, but the area
 of modern building is increasing.     
  There are 4 main agriculture types:  
 hops,cider apples,grass &amp; winter      
 barley and a few small local          
 industries.
