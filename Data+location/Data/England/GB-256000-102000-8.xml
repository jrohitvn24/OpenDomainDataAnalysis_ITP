		<title>08Housing in Woodhalls</title>
		<content> As Woodhalls is in a conservation area
 the building of new houses and the    
 alteration of old ones is strictly    
 controlled by law. The few dwellings  
 erected in recent years have been     
 soley for the needs of agriculture.   
 Five others were probably built in the
 late 19th/early 2Oth century.The rest 
 are considerably older,some dating    
 possibly from the 14th century,       
 including several Devon longhouses.   
     Many of the houses are built of   
 stone but others are of cob:- a       
 mixture of clay, gravel and straw. In 
 the present day a cement mixture is   
 used when repairs are necessary. A    
 number of old houses are thatched with
 straw.Interiors often reveal ancient  
 wooden beams, original bread ovens and
 huge fireplaces.
