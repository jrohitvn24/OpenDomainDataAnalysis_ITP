		<content> The Tweed Dock has been open for over 
 100 years.It is run by a group of     
 people known as the BERWICK HARBOUR   
 COMMISSIONERS.The largest ship that   
 can enter the dock is 70 metres long  
 or 700 tonnes dead weight.The         
 restriction in size is caused by the  
 narrow entrance gate.The dock has     
 1,550 feet of quay frontage.The       
 berthing fee is Â£19 per 100tons or    
 Â£100 per week. In the summer there are
 4 or 5 ships that enter the docks,    
 while in winter the number is reduced 
 to3 ships per week. There are 4 full  
 time dockers employed.
