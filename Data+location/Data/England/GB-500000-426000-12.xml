		<title>12A STREET IN HESSLE</title>
		<content> There are about 120 houses in our     
 street (Barrow Lane). Some of them    
 were built in 1888 and are almost 100 
 years old. There are no shops in      
 Barrow Lane. There are no buildings   
 for special purposes. All of the      
 houses are made of brick. Most of the 
 roof tiles are made of slate. Nearly  
 all the houses have gardens with      
 fences or hedges round them. It is a  
 straight, quiet, narrow road. There   
 are drainage grids with iron bars     
 across. The surface of the road is    
 slighly higher in the middle so that  
 the water can run off. It has sodium  
 lamps which have timers to turn them  
 on and off. It has a few trees on     
 either side.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
