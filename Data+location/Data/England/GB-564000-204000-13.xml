		<title>13WRITTLE BY-PASS</title>
		<content> In 1978 the road from Ongar to Writtle
 was made into the A415. This meant    
 that Writtle was now on the main route
 that drivers would take if they wanted
 to join the new M11 motorway. People  
 were sure that this would mean that   
 more and more traffic would use the   
 the village and that if this happened 
 it would be bad for the community. A  
 committee was set up to campaign for a
 Writtle by-pass to be constructed as  
 soon as possible.                     
       In June 1985 Writtle residents  
 were given something to celebrate when
 they heard that a four and a half     
 million pound by-pass, designed to    
 free the village from heavy traffic   
 had been given the go ahead.The       
 by-pass is scheduled for completion in
 1987.
