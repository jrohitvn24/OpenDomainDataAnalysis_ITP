Sunday started with a punch in the eye 
from my two year old brother. Then my  
brother was throwing Weetabix at me, so
that's what I had for breakfast. Then I
decided to go out to play with my      
friend James for the day.              
We had a great time on his computer    
game.It was called Harrier Attack.I    
helped his family by looking after     
their dog Misty, a lovely golden yellow
labrador. For dinner we had roast      
pork and roast potatoes.Their dad was  
putting the sails up on his boat.After 
he had done that we went sailing at a  
sailing club.Their mum was at home     
looking after the dog and playing the  
piano.
