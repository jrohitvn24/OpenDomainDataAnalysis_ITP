		<title>12A STREET BARBEQUE</title>
		<content>   Every year when it is near          
 Midsummer, we have a barbeque on the  
 field near where we live. People from 
 far and near come to celebrate. we    
 have the barbeque in rememberance of  
 those who died in the Second World    
 War. It stretches from the field right
 round to the street. There are cake   
 and sweet stalls, and a man selling   
 hot-dogs and pies. When we have had   
 something to eat we play some games.  
 We have an egg and spoon race, and a  
 sack race. When it is near to the end 
 we are entertained by clowns, dancers,
 and a magician. Any money raised is   
 then given to the local old peoples   
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
