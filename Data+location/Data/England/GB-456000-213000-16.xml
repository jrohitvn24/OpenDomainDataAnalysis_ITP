		<title>16CHARLTON-ON-OTMOOR'S MAY DAY</title>
		<content>Early on May Day morning people in     
Charlton bring flowers to the School.  
They are made into bunches and tied    
onto a Garland.The Garland is made out 
of seven wire hoops with rope joining  
them together.The oldest children      
in the School carry the Garland to the 
Church.The younger children make       
crosses decorated with flowers.Walking 
to the Church they stop to sing the May
Garland carol.The Garland is given to  
the Vicar and hung on the Screen in the
Church.The crosses are laid infront of 
the Screen.After the Service everyone  
meets outside of the Church for the May
Dancing.The children leave the Church  
and perform Country Dances.The six     
eldest girls and boys dance around the 
Maypole.The May Day celebration is a   
very old tradition and most of the     
village come to watch.
