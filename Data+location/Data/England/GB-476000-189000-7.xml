		<content>  Only Frieth possesses facilities for 
shopping. Most families shop for their 
groceries and provisions at the super  
markets in the local towns - Wycombe,  
Marlow or Henley.                      
  Several years ago Frieth had a       
village stores, and a sub-post office. 
The post office closed. The Village    
Stores was modernised and a sub-post   
office installed. That too closed, but 
the local dairyman opened a new shop   
and an extension was built as a        
sub-post office.                       
  The Dairy sells a full range of      
groceries and provisions and general   
goods typical of a village shop, as    
well as a full range of dairy produce  
supplied by a national dairy. The milk 
delivery vans are equipped to carry    
a range of groceries and provisions.   
   The old village shop now sells house
furnishings.                           </content>
