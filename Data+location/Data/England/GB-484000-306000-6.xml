		<title>06Opinions about Oakham</title>
		<content> I think Oakham is good because it has 
 a big park and two churches and one   
 church hall.  I live down the road    
 from a church, it is our school's     
 church.  (by Josh Findlay, 8 yrs old) 
                                       
 I like living in Oakham because we    
 have got a big house and two cars and 
 a big garden.  We have quite a big    
 porch.  (Simon Dooley, 8 yrs old)     
                                       
 I think Oakham is good because there  
 are lots of big shops like NNS which  
 is a newspagents.  It is a brand new  
 shop and it opened this year.
