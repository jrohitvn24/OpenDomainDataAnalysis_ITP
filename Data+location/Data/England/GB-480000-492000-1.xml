		<title>01Levisham Moor Area</title>
		<content> Basdically the block has a flattish   
 and forested western half divided from
 the eastern higher heather covered    
 levisham moor by Pickering Beek, along
 which runs north yorkshire moors      
 railway.   The forests are mainly     
 conifer plantations, mainly cattle and
 sheep grazing.   The only residents   
 live ina few farms and are concerned  
 with farming and forestry.   The      
 vehicular access is limited to dirt   
 tracks mainly usedd for the forestry  
 industry, but the scenery, especially 
 around Lewisham Moor, is spectacular  
 so the area is much visited by        
 tourists, espically on foot from      
 Newton Dale area or Hole of Horum.    
 The moorland area is used for sheep   
 grazing and grouse shooting may have  
 been a use.
