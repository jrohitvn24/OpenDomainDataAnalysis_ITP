		<content> Johnson Fold Estate is a council      
 estate built in the 1950's on the     
 northern edge of Bolton's residential 
 area.It is comprised of terraced and  
 semi-detached houses with a few       
 bungalows for the elderly.They are two
 or three bedroomed houses with lounge,
 kitchen and bathrooms heated by gas,  
 electric or coal fires.Most of the    
 property is rented with about 10% of  
 families following the present trend  
 of buying their houses.The estate is  
 undergoing an extensive renovation    
 project.All the houses are being      
 electrically re-wired and are being   
 fitted with wall insulation.Some      
 houses are being re-fitted with doors 
 and window frames and are having      
 electrical central heating installed.
