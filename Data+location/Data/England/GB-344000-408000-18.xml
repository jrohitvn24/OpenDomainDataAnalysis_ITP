		<title>18Leeds-Liverpool Canal.</title>
		<content>Our section was built in 1774. At      
{Spencers Bridge}there are 3 cottages &amp;
a swing bridge. By the cottages was a  
barge called Waterlupin. There were    
brick &amp; concrete {pillboxes.}An        
{aqueduct} takes the canal over the    
{R.Tawd.}We saw dragonflies,           
butterflies,seagulls,ducks,goats       
convounlus,Ox eye daisies,red &amp; white  
clover,buttercups, hawkweed,yellow &amp;   
blue vetch, rose bay willow herb, cow  
parsley,grass,thistle,rushes, water    
lilys, hawthorn, beech and ash trees.  
Most barges are now pleasure craft,    
there were also motor boats. The canal 
is also used by anglers. They catch    
perch and roach. Mrs Martland lives in 
one of the bargee's cottages. She has  
10 stables &amp; 7 pig sties at the back of
her house. The stables were used for   
the old barge horses. There was a ramp 
for horses which fell in the canal.    </content>
