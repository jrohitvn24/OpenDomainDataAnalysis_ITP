		<title>15News from Creeting School</title>
		<content>  The school has had a busy year with  
many activities and outings. The 7-9   
year olds visited the London           
Planetarium and Madame Tussauds by     
train in May and the 5-7 year olds,    
Norton Bird Gardens  and Chadacre      
Agricultural Institute by bus in July. 
  Other visits have been made to see   
houses old and new, a farm, pets,      
lambs and nature trails. People        
visiting the school included children  
from Ringshall school and a policeman, 
postman and parent who all came to     
give a talk.                           
  The Sports were held on July 17th,   
postponed by rain from the day before. 
  A school leavers' service was held in
church on July 19th. The children read 
the lesson, chose the hymns and took   
the collection. They decided to give   
this to a school for disabled children 
and they took it there the next day.   </content>
