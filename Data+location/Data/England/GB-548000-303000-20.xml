 room where organisations can hold     
 their meetings.                       
 Children begin their formal schooling 
 at Beaupre in the academic year in    
 which their fifth birthday falls. In  
 the Infant Reception Class there is a 
 full-time Nursery Assistant. There are
 three other classes in the school and 
 the children move on to their local   
 Secondary schools when they are eleven
 years of age. Beaupre has an excellent
 reputation in the area; the children  
 receive a sound education from a      
 dedicated, hard-working staff. The    
 close community links have undoubtedly
 enhanced the school's reputation.
