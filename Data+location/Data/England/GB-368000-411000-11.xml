		<title>11EAGLEY MILLS</title>
		<content> Eagley Mills was built about 150 years
 ago,next to Eagley Brook.Eagley Mills 
 was owned by a large manufacturing    
 cotton firm call J.P.Coats.The mills  
 were built next to Eagley Brook in    
 order to provide the damp conditions  
 needed for dyeing and bleaching cloth.
 At Eagley Mills they spun and         
 manufactured sewing cotton.Near the   
 mill a school,cottages and a church   
 were built for the workers.In the mill
 children and adults worked very long  
 hours.                                
 After the war it was sold to a firm   
 and the mill was split up into smaller
 units and leased out to a variety of  
 smaller businesses as the accomodation
 was cheap and plentiful.Now different 
 companies work there e.g.a mail order 
 firm,a keep fit studio,light          
 engineering works,a company which     
 designs needlework kits and others.   </content>
