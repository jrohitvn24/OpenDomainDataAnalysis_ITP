		<title>09SHOPPING IN SUTTON VENY</title>
		<content>   I live in Sutton Veny and I go to   
 the Post Office and village shop on   
 Monday.  When I go to the Post Office 
 I look around and there are lots of   
 different things for sale.  There are 
 sweets, rice, ice-lollies, dog and cat
 food, rulers, combs and toilet rolls. 
 I have a savings book with the Post   
 Office.                               
                                       
   A milkman comes on most days of the 
 week to our house.  On Saturday a     
 baker and a butcher come and a fruit  
 van.  Some old people come out and buy
 food from the vans because they don't 
 like going out very far.  I go to     
 Warminster with my Mum on Saturdays to
 do some shopping and sometimes I go to
 the park.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
