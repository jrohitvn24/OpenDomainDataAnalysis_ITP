		<content> Three quarters of the area surveyed is
 covered by the North Sea. Of the      
 remaining three squares on the        
 West,vertical edge of this block the  
 central one covers the tidal estuary  
 of the River Tweed. The area to the   
 North of the river covers the Eastern 
 extremity of Berwick upon Tweed and to
 the South lies Spittal.               
 COASTLINE.This runs in a generally    
 North South orientation >It is rocky  
 to the North of the River Tweed and   
 changes to a mixture of low cliffs and
 long,sandy beaches to the South.      
 SPITTAL is an extended village which  
 lies between the beach to the East and
 a railway embankment on a slope to the
 West which carries British Rail's East
 Coast railway line.
