		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF EMMA -1</title>
		<content>  Today is Wednesday and I am just     
 scrambling out of bed. I am putting on
 a pair of jeans and a jumper to go    
 down the yard with Mummy. I have just 
 had a cup of tea and now I am trying  
 to put my wellies on, now coat and    
 hat. I have just taken the dog's lead 
 off the hook on the wall. Now I have  
 arrived at the yard and I am helping  
 Mummy milk Buttercup, the house cow.  
 Now I am having Rice Krispies for     
 breakfast - just in the bathroom,     
 washing and puting my school clothes  
 on. I must not forget to clean my     
 teeth!                                
  I am now at school and we are having 
 our dictation. After that, we go      
 swimming in Cirencester. Now we are   
 having dinner: beefburgers,beans and  
 chips followed by chocolate crunch    
 with pink custard. After playtime, we 
 have Singing Together with Mrs Talbot.</content>
