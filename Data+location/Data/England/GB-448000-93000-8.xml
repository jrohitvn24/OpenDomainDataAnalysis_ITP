    We then went to see Lynden's dad.  
 He took us to see the mobile unit of  
 the "AR3D".  Unfortunately there was a
 malfunction in the mobile.            
    Then we went to the computer room  
 where a man was drawing graphics of   
 radar and he drew us a picture.       
    Then we went down to the workshop  
 and saw some of the equipment.        
    We then had to go back to the      
 security box and hand in our stickers.
    It was a great visit.
