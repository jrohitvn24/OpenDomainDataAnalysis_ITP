		<title>07RIVER WEY AND WEY NAVIGATION</title>
		<content> The River Wey and Wey Navigation is to
 the west of Send. There is a towpath  
 from the Cartbridge, in Send, to      
 Guildford. Above Ashburton Footbridge 
 is Worsfold Gates where a new flood   
 system is in operation. Triggs Lock is
 an 18th century lock-keeper's cottage.
 From here is a view across the flood  
 plain of the river to Send Church and 
 the North Downs beyond. Later the Wey 
 flows round the Sutton Park Estate.   
 The principal traffic in the past was 
 timber and agricultural produce to    
 London and corn brought back to many  
 mills.  Grain traffic from London     
 Docks to Coxes Mill, Weybridge ceased 
 in 1969. The Wey Navigation is now    
 used solely for leisure. Narrow boats,
 motor cruisers, etc. can be hired. The
 Waterway was given to the National    
 Trust in 1964.
