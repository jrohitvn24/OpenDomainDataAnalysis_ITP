		<content> Sharnbrook Playgroup provides         
 experiences in{co-operation and       
{learning for the three to five year   
{olds.} It is run by a committee of    
 mothers who appoint playleaders and   
 organise the finances.                
{Play}with sand, water and paint, while
 satisfying in itself, also encourages 
 manipulative skills and introduces    
 awareness of texture.                 
{Physical activities}- dance, exercise 
 and climbing promote co-ordination    
 which leads to agility. {Imaginative  
{play,}fostered through dressing up,   
 wendy house play or pretend hospitals 
 enables the child to learn about real 
 world situations.  He is also learning
 about friendship, sharing,            
 communicating and co-operating with   
 others.  The child learns gradual     
 independence from home in a safe,     
 exciting environment.                 </content>
