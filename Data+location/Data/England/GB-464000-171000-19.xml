		<content>    Peoples tastes are changing all the
 time as developments are made in media
 provision.After the last World War    
 most people listened to the radio,or  
 wireless as some called it.Very few   
 people now listen to the radio on the 
 regular basis they once did.          
    Today,the majority of homes have at
 least one television set,and some have
 more.Most people will spend some of   
 their time during the week viewing and
 some will spend a lot!                
    As videos become more widespread,  
 they are being used increasingly to   
 allow people greater freedom and      
 choice.They can be set to record a    
 favourite programme whilst the owner  
 is out at some other activity.On      
 return he or she may watch it at their
 leisure.                              
    Most homes take a daily paper.Many 
 take comics for the children.         </content>
