		<content> There are four main churches in       
 Broadway.{St.Michael's Church of      
{England}was built in 1840 and has a   
 congregation of 200, the majority     
 being over 50 years of age. However it
 runs a thriving Sunday School and     
 makes great efforts to attract younger
 people.{St.Saviour's Roman Catholic   
{Church}originated from a Passionist   
 Monastery. Due to failing vocations   
 this closed in 1983 but a Passionist  
 Priest still serves the parish. About 
 300 people are on the register with   
 ages ranging from birth to 90 years   
 but the majority are elderly.{The     
{Methodist Church}has 40 to 60 people  
 attending Sunday worship mostly in the
 older age range.{The United Reform    
{Church}started in 1792 and has 65     
 regular churchgoers from 3 to 85 years
 of age. All churches rely on volunteer
 help for cleaning,flowers and upkeep. </content>
