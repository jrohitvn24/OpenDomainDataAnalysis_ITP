		<title>02Lyminge village hall</title>
		<content> Construction of the village hall      
 started at the beginning of 1981. It  
 took about a year to build and was    
 opened on 15th May 1982 by Lady       
 Brabourne, daughter of Lord           
 Mountbatten. Lyminge Cubs and Scouts, 
 and also the Brownies and Guides came 
 to the opening along with a large     
 number of villagers. Three years after
 the opening we are still paying for   
 the hall, but now it is nearly paid   
 for. Walks and fetes raised the money.
 The hall is used for roller skating,  
 playgroup, dramatic society, judo and 
 meetings. The football field is used  
 by the Cubs and Scouts, also by the   
 school for fetes. The village hall    
 consists of the main hall, a club     
 room, a meeting room, a kitchen, bar, 
 showers, toilets and store room. The  
 approximate cost of hiring the hall is
 Â£5 per hour.                          </content>
