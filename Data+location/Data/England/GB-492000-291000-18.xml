		<content>Recollections of Mr Jack Elliott...a   
resident of Deene.                     
   "Village life has changed a lot. I  
was born in Deenethorpe at the start of
the century,and I remember walking to  
Deene School each day...and I had to go
home for dinner. I joined the church   
choir in 1910..there were 24 of us,12  
men and 12 boys,and I stayed in the    
choir until the church closed..I was   
the only member.                       
    When I moved to Deene I worked on  
the Estate...and continued there until 
I retired a couple of years ago.I was  
there for seventy years. When I first  
came here there was a Post Office, a   
blacksmith,a pub and I recall a slater 
working at one of the cottages.There   
was more social life then. Now every   
-one keeps to themselves..and village  
life seems to have gone."
