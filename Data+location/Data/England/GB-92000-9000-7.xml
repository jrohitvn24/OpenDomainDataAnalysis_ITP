		<content>     There is very little crime in this
 area and in the winter there are only 
 2 policemen for the whole of the      
 Scilly Isles.In the summer 2 more     
 police constables from the Devon and  
 Cornwall Constabulary are posted here 
 to help with the influx of tourists.  
 There are also 3 special constables   
 for use on certain special occasions. 
 The police station has 2 cells and was
 built in 1975.There is also a police  
 land rover,a bicycle and a police     
 speedboat for visiting other islands. 
 The responsibility for smuggling and  
 associated cries comes under our local
 Customs and Immigration Officer.A     
 Magistrates Court is set up on St.    
 Mary's and there are 5 J.P.'s.Any more
 serious crime has to be tried at      
 Bodmin in Cornwall.
