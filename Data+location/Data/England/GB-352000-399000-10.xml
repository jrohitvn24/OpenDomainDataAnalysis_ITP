		<title>10BILLINGE MINES</title>
		<content>  The two drift mines in Billinge are  
 both privately owned, they are called 
 Castle Colliery and Quaker House      
 Colliery.                             
  One of the differences between them  
 is the age, Castle Colliery was opened
 18 months ago in 1983, whereas Quaker 
 House Colliery was opened 35 years ago
 in 1950.                              
  Another difference is the number of  
 people employed by both mines.The     
 Castle employs 21 people, Quaker House
 employ 55,which makes them bigger.    
  Both mines have the men using old    
 fashioned methods of mining i.e. using
 picks and shovels, so tend to employ  
 older men who know how to do it.      
 Quaker House has more mechanisation   
 and tends to buy old stock and        
 renovate it in their own workshop. The
 Quaker House Mine mines 5000 tonnes   
 per year more than the Castle Mine.   </content>
