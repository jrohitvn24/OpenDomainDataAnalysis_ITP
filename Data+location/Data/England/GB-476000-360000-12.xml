		<title>12Cromwell and Norwell's Vicar</title>
		<content>  {Rev. James}has been a vicar since   
 1952, after being a pilot in the      
 R.A.F. during World War Two. His      
 parish covers the villages of{Norwell}
 and{Cromwell}in our block.            
   Sunday is a very busy day for him as
 it will involve morning, afternoon and
 evening services at sometimes Norwell,
 Cromwell and Ossington. This would    
 have been impossible in the pre motor 
 car age.                              
   No two weekdays are alike for the   
 vicar. He likes to spend his mornings 
 reading the newspaper, in quiet prayer
 and reading a chapter or two of the   
{Good News Bible.}He has people ring   
 him for advice and is often asked to  
 help fill in official forms.          
   He enjoys walking around the village
 with his dog and visiting his         
 parishioners. He visits our school    
 every Thursday and takes{assembly. }  </content>
