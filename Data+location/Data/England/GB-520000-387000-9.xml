		<content> 85 year old Mr.G.H.Brant has farmed   
 the Grange for 60 years _ forebears   
 from Holland in 18thC to introduce    
 Dutch drainage methods to fenlands of 
 Lincs. which became New Holland. They 
 were shipwrecked and stayed to settle.
 When he started he had 13 horses with 
 3 men to look after them, 3 labourers,
 a foreman and a Garthman. In those    
 days the village had its own Saddler, 
 Blacksmith, Wheelwright, Coal Merchant
 Carpenter/Undertaker &amp;c. All now gone 
 and these services found elsewhere.The
 Horse Age has ended in his lifetime. A
 man &amp; 2 horses could plough an acre a 
 day. Today a tractor can plough 20    
 acres a day _ more with headlamps at  
 night. In the old days a furrow was 9 
 inches wide &amp; 6 inches deep. Today a  
 plough can cut many furrows up to 2 ft
 deep.60 years ago land cost under Â£30 
 per acre _ today it is around Â£2000.  </content>
