		<title>03TRANSPORT : THE WALL AREA.</title>
		<content>  Although a mainly rural area there is
a large network of roadways serving the
region, linking with major settlements 
at Lichfield, Walsall and Birmingham.  
The focus of the road system is the A5 
Watling Street which crosses the A5127 
Sutton Coldfield to Lichfield, and A461
Walsall to Lichfield, roads. Proposals 
are being considered at the present    
time to enlarge the A5 into a six lane 
highway whilst four other alternative  
routes are being considered to ease    
traffic congestion in the Birmingham   
region.                                
                                       
  The Lichfield to Birmingham railway  
provides both passenger and freight    
services but the Lichfield to Walsall  
line is only used for oil freight to   
Brownhills. The Wyrley and Essington   
canal which is now disused formerly    
ran through the middle of the area.    </content>
