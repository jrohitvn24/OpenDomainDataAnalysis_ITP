		<content>   As a result of the traffic jams     
 in Okehampton which have tailed back  
 for over fifteen miles, there has to  
 be a{By_pass}built. It could either   
 go through Dartmoor or it would go    
 through the north side which is farm  
 land.                                 
   First it was going through the      
 south side which is Dartmoor but the  
 House Of Lords ruled that out because 
 there is a law saying unless there is 
 no alternative route, a trunk road    
 cannot go through or on a National    
 Park.                                 
   We found out that if it goes on     
  he north side it would affect Knowle 
 bridge and Knowle quarry. People would
 lose their jobs. Also there would have
 to be an enormous viaduct over the    
 River Okement in Brightley valley and 
 this would spoil the lovely wooded    
 valley.                               </content>
