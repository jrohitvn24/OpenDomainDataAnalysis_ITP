		<content> Church House,the old work house,was   
 then the Post Office. The Postmen and 
 women delivered all the letters on    
 bicycles. Stamps cost 0.5d (0.2p) for 
 a card and 1d (0.4p) for a letter.    
 There were two posts a day and letters
 were delivered within 24hrs.          
 We had a local policeman who was seen 
 cycling around most days. Everyone had
 great respect for the Squire,Rector,  
 School Master and Police. The roads   
 were much safer as traffic was much   
 slower. There were still a few people 
 using horses and traps, even to go to 
 Church.                               
 There was a service every day in      
 Church.The Church and the Village Hall
 were heated by coke stoves and were   
 always lovely and warm.               
 There were no council houses. Where   
 the school now stands was a field with
 a pond.                               </content>
