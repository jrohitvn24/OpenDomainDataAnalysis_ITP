 WHICH ATTRACTS TOURISTS,AND A FORGE   
 WHICH PROVIDES A REPAIR AND WELDING   
 SERVICE.                              
 THERE ARE FOUR BUIDING CONTRACTORS,   
 THREE HAIRDRESSERS,THREE PUBLIC       
 HOUSES, A BOARDING KENNELS,A GARAGE

 UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE LOCAL TRADERS,  
 SHOPPING IN SUPERMARKETS IS CHEAPER

 BUY THEIR MAIN PROVISIONS IN TENTERDEN
