		<title>16The Ambulance Station.</title>
		<content> We visited the Ambulance Station where
 Mr.Fraser showed us around.           
   There are six front vehicles,one    
 relief and one sitter bus.The front   
 vehicles have blue lights on the top  
 and a siren. They are used for        
 emergencies.The sitter bus isn't used 
 for emergencies but for transporting  
 people to and from hospital.          
   Before beginning their shift each   
 crew member checks his or her own     
 ambulance.Inside the ambulance is all 
 the necessary equipment.The enterox   
 gas is in a blue cylinder with a      
 quarter white collar,this is for      
 easing pain.The oxygen cylinder is    
 black with a white collar.The suction 
 pump is used to suck debris from the  
 throat.The resusitator is the same as 
 the oxygen bottle but is used to get a
 victim breathing again.The chair is   
 used for people who are unable to walk</content>
