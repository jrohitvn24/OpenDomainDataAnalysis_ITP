		<content> As a teenager who has left school     
 there are a few options open.Many find
 jobs in Tenterden and the surrounding 
 villages or Ashford our nearest       
 town.Others go on to Further or Higher
 Education at Colleges,Polytechnics or 
 University.Job opportunities are      
 relatiuely good in this area.         
    Facilities enjoyed at Homewood     
 school are missed by school           
 leavers.Evening classes at the school 
 run for a limited period only,and     
 regular visits to the sports centre at
 Ashford can become costly.To maintain 
 an interest in hockey, I joined       
 Ashford Hockey Club, but for many     
 teenagers, transport is a problem.    
 Social activities in Tenterden are    
 severely limited. There is nowhere for
 young people to meet for a coffee and 
 a chat once they have outgrown the    
 local youth club.     {(continued)    </content>
