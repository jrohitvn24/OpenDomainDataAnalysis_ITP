		<title>20HATCH BEAUCHAMP SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    The school was originally built of 
 stone and in 1875 consisted of only   
 one classroom with an adjoining house 
 where the teacher lived. Later, the   
 hall was added to the school. Later   
 still, a mobile classroom block       
 arrived and this now houses the infant
 class and the school kitchen. Another 
 change came to the old building when, 
 the toilet block was added and the    
 school house was converted into an    
 office, staff_room and library. Today,
 there are 45 pupils and one part_time 
 and two full_time teachers.           
   The pupils who worked on this       
 Domesday Project were: Rachel         
 Anderson, Simon Brittain, Katy Bulger,
 Matthew Day, Christopher Hare, Ruth   
 Parsons, Zoe Pring, Melissa Rossiter  
 and Mark Sutton.
