		<content> The main{A342}road cuts the block     
 almost on its diagonal and connects   
{Andover}with{Ludgershall.} Much money 
 has been spent on new and improved    
 roads to cope with more and more cars 
 and lorries.  Many families now have  
 two cars and the development of the   
 motor vehicle in this century has     
 caused more alteration to the         
 countryside than anything in the nine 
 hundred years since the original      
{Domesday.}                            
                                       
 Much money is spent on maintaining    
 roads, providing road signs, and on   
 white lines to try to make driving    
 safer.  Yet every year many hundreds  
 of people are killed and injured.     
 Owners have to leave their cars in    
 their own private garages or on the   
 roads if they have no room on their   
 own property.                         </content>
