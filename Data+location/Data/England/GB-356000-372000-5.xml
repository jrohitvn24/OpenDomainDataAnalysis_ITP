		<content>  There are a number of traditional    
  farm houses, some of them still      
 worked as farms, but some  have had   
 the land sold off and are now private 
 houses. In addition there are  small  
 cottages which were originally built  
 for farm workers.  Many have been     
 extended and modernised in recent     
 years and now command a very high     
 price.                                
  Some recent building has taken place 
 and these properties tend to be large 
 executive houses and bungalows.  At   
 the south east edge of the area is a  
 large modern private housing          
 development called Delamere Park,     
 which has its own swimming pool and   
 sports club open only to residents.   
  Sadly, some of the young people who  
 were born in the area are unable to   
 afford the high price of the houses   
 and have had to move away.            </content>
