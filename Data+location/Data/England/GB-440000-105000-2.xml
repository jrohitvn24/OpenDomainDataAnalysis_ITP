		<title>02ARMY CADET FORCE</title>
		<content> The Army Cadet Force is a youth       
 organisation for young boys aged      
 between 13 and 18 years of age. Its   
 training is based on the same type as 
 the army but it is not taught at such 
 a high level. There is also training  
 based on civilian needs such as first 
 aid.                                  
 The Army Cadets meet at the Hythe Hut 
 every Tuesday and Thursday.  There are
 also plenty of weekend camps and      
 exercises and every year there is an  
 annual camp.                          
 At Hythe there are 30 cadets and the  
 hut receives a lot of help from the   
 army base at Marchwood. The regiment  
 under which the cadets are based is   
 the Royal Corps of Transport which is 
 the same as Marchwood so the cadets do
 a lot of driving and training at the  
 base.                                 
                                       </content>
