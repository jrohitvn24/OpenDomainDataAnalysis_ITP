		<title>15Abbotsley Youth Club</title>
		<content> In Abbotsley there is a youth club.   
 It is held in the Village hall.All    
 the children can go if they are       
 under 18. I don't go but my friend    
 does and she enjoys it.There are      
 games,also there are Arcade games     
 and tennis and computers.The youth    
 club is on Mondays;starts around      
 6.30,ends at 9.30.Lots of people      
 quite enjoy it.Sometimes it gets      
 a bit rough and some older children   
 start fights.The leader runs it and   
 the children help set it up.There     
 is a tuck shop there that sells       
 all sorts of sweets like 1p and 2p    
 sweets and big bars like Mars.        
 Also there is a snooker table where   
 you put 10p in.I really think it is   
 a good idea and I hope they carry     
 on with it.
