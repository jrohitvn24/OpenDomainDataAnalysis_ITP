		<title>03NEW VILLAGE MIDDLE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Our school is quite old and we have 
 240 pupils in the school with about 24
 pupils to a class.We have got four    
 years in the school.As we go up       
 through the years the work gets harder
 and harder.                           
   The school has a library,three      
 shared areas,nine classes and a hall  
 for all the school to have assemblies 
 and class assemblies where one class  
 performs a play or shows some work    
 that they have done.This is done in   
 front of the whole school.            
   Sometimes a teacher does an assembly
 too.At christmas we have a big play   
 where most of the school join in and a
 lot of families come to watch.
