		<title>03Hobs Moat in Solihull</title>
		<content> This area, with its royal links, is   
recorded in the original Domesday Book.
The Conqueror gave the Manor of        
Ulverlei to Cristina.She was the sister
of Edgar the Atheling, last male of the
Saxon royal family who handed the      
throne of England to William.          
 In 1086 an estimated 145 people lived 
in the area between the moat and the   
present site of St. Margaret's Church. 
The origin of the name Hobs Moat is not
clear. The Odingsells family owned the 
manor in 1213. Their name has also been
recorded as Hoginsells - giving the    
name Hoggs Moat leading to Hobs Moat.  
 Supernatural ties have also been made 
with this area, Hob being a Medieval   
term for the devil. In early 1985, The 
Solihull Times reported on evidence of 
modern-day witchcraft taking place in  
the Moat amongst the 258 Oak trees     
which now cover the historical site.   </content>
