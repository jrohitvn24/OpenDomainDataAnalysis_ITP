 chancel was built in 1880 and         
 renovated in 1959 by J.H.Cowine.The   
 inscription at the base of the brass {
{LECTERN}records that it was presented 
 with thanks for the safe-keeping of   
 Harold Sharp Leigh Slater when run    
 over by a cab in Leicester Street     
 in 1885.The elaborately carved {      
{REREDOS,PANELS AND ALTAR},were        
 originally in St. Peter's Church,     
 Liverpool and were erected in their   
 present position in 1922 when that    
 church was demolished.The East Window 
 was donated in 1914 by the late       
 C.H.Fleetwood-Hesketh, in memory of   
 his ancestors who worshipped at the   
 Church.
