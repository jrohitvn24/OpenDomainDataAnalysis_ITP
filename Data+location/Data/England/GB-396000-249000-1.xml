		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> THIS IS A RURAL AREA LYING ABOVE THE  
 VALLEY OF THE RIVER AVON AND TO THE   
 WEST OF A SMALL GROUP OF HILLS CALLED 
 THE LENCHES.THE CLIMATE IS TEMPERATE. 
 THE VILLAGES OF BISHAMPTON AND        
 THROCKMORTON ARE THE TWO MAIN AREAS   
 OF POPULATION. EACH VILLAGE HAS A     
 CHURCH AND IS A MIXTURE OF OLD AND NEW
 HOUSES, THE NOW DISUSED PERSHORE AIR  
 FIELD COVERS THE SOUTH WEST CORNER OF 
 THE AREA.THERE IS A LITTLE WOODLAND,  
 SOME ORCHARDS BUT MOST OF THE AREA IS 
 USED AS PASTURE  OR FOR SOWING CROPS. 
 THERE IS NO INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS BUT   
 QUITE A FEW PEOPLE ARE SELF-EMPLOYED. 
 THE CHILDREN OF BOTH VILLAGES HAVE TO 
 TRAVEL OUT OF THE AREA TO GO TO       
 SCHOOL, AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS       
 MINIMAL.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
