		<title>11The western bypass</title>
		<content> During 1985 the Department of the     
 Environment has accepted the route of 
 the old Yarmouth to Lowestoft railway 
 line. This was in preference to a     
 slightly more westerly route, avoiding
 Gorleston completely. There is,       
 however, fierce local opposition since
 new open parkland would, in part, be  
 converted into a roundabout. In       
 addition another would have to be     
 built on Beccles Rd. In all some      
 twenty houses, at least, would be     
 destroyed in building the road and two
 bridges at Lowestoft Rd and Church    
 Lane. In September the first stage of 
 the Southtown bypass came into        
 operation when a dual carriage way was
 opened through Harfrey's Industrial   
 Estate. Eventually the new road will  
 extend across Breydon Water to Acle   
 New Rd, providing the long awaited    
 second river crossing.                </content>
