 The area lies South of the market town
 of Chagford within Dartmoor National  
 Park;three hills (Week Down,Nattadon, 
 and Meldon) dominate the scene        
 spectacularly. The unfenced turf is   
 cropped by sheep and moorland ponies  
 but bracken is shoulder high in       
 summer. There are no great houses here
 but several ancient hamlets. The      
 fields,mainly pasture for sheep and   
 cattle retain their ancient granite   
 walls topped with thorny hedges. The  
 land is steep, small farms shelter in 
 the valleys from the harsh Dartmoor   
 weather. Swift boulder-strewn streams 
 water the area. The tortuous lanes,   
 widened in Victorian times, are still 
 too narrow for cars to pass except in 
 special places.The area is rich in    
 wildlife and flowers.
