		<title>12Pershore Police Station</title>
		<content>      We visited{Pershore Police       
{Station}as part of our{environmental  
{studies}project. We looked at a Panda 
 car and a police motorbike which we   
 were told all about. The police       
 motorcyclist sounded the horn which   
 was very loud. Both of the vehicles   
 had radios to communicate with each   
 other and report back to police HQ.   
      We went inside and saw the       
{magistrates' courtroom.}We sat in the 
 seats and took turns at sitting in the
 chairman's seat. We read the oaths    
 printed on cards. We were told about  
 the work of the{village bobby}and also
 the plain clothes detectives. A       
 policewoman showed us the two cells   
 where people were kept temporarily.   
 Some of us had our finger-prints taken
 to take back to school.
