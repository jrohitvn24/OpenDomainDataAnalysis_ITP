		<title>14The Cat and Man Legend.</title>
		<content> When they reached St. Helens stream,  
 Winifred made a tremendous leap, but  
 failed and fell headlong into the     
 water.Sir Percival was thrown to the  
 ground and the wild cat flew at him.A 
 terrible struggle ensued, and blood   
 flowed from both man and cat.They     
 struggled on up the hill to Barnburgh,
 reaching the churchyard and finally   
 the church porch.Weak from his        
 terrible ordeal, Sir Percival fell    
 dying, as he fell he crushed the cat  
 against the wall of the porch and     
 killed it.Sir Percival's servant,     
 somewhat alarmed when Winifred arrived
 back at The Hall riderless and covered
 in blood, set off to search for his   
 master.He found Sir Percival dying in 
 the church porch. The church porch    
 floor still carries the blood stains. 
 So the man killed the cat, and the cat
 killed the man.                       </content>
