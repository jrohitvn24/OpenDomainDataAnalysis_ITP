		<title>11Shops in N/Ham/Coll P</title>
		<content>There is no large shopping area in     
North Hammersmith and College Park, but
there are several small parades of     
shops for people to buy various items. 
Most of the shops are connected with   
food, either selling food or as a take 
-away hot food shop. Other shops       
include do it yourself,florist, motor  
accessory shops,estate agents,post     
office,building society,travel agents  
and Banks. The shops are open from     
9a.m. to 6p.m.Monday to                
Friday.Some newspaper shops and food   
shops also open on a Sunday too.  Most 
shops are self-service,where people    
choose their goods and pay for them    
at a check out. Most people in the area
would like a shopping area with large  
shops especially for food and          
clothes.In Shepherds Bush there is an  
open street market for food,clothes and
electrical items.                      </content>
