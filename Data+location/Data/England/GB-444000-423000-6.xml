		<title>06Ferrybridge Power Station</title>
		<content> Sometimes at night,whoosh,the power   
 station lets off steam.It makes you   
 lie awake for ages.When you look out- 
 side you can see traffic but you can't
 hear it because of the noise.At night 
 when I look out of my window I can see
 all the red lights on the power stat- 
 ion chimneys They are to warn aircraft
 that there are cooling towers and tall
 chimneys about.Steam comes out of the 
 cooling towers like balls of cotton   
 wool.When the suns shines,it changes  
 colour,grey,yellow,pink or just plain 
 white.Smoke and chemicals come out of 
 the chimneys. The power station people
 check the rainfall over Ferrybridge to
 see if it is polluted.They have a rain
 collector in our school grounds.Most  
 of the chemicals blow to Sweden and   
 turn to acid rain.People complain when
 ash floats down and makes a mess of   
 their cars and houses.It looks awful. </content>
