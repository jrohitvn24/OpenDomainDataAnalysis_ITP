		<title>04Religion-Woolaston Church</title>
		<content>   Dedicated to St.Andrew. Built by the
 Normans in the 13th century on an     
 earlier holy site. Tower rebuilt in   
 1859 (see photo)                      
   Inside-main altar and a smaller Lady
 Chapel used for small                 
 congregations.The pulpit came from    
 Clayton, Northants-dates from the     
 1750s. The font is 14th century.      
   It is unusual because it is one mile
 away from the modern village-because  
 original village around the church was
 abandoned due to the plague in the    
 17th century.The pauper's cross in the
 graveyard has holes in it where money 
 was offered in vinegar to prevent     
 plague transmission.                  
   There is a rumour in the village due
 to cost of upkeep church will close   
 soon and congregation transferred to  
 Alvington. The Rectory has been sold.
