		<content> The family unit is still strong within
 this area.Some of the farming families
 have been here for several generations
 and a high proportion are linked by   
 marriage.Because there is no easy way 
 of travelling to local towns the      
 children stay within their own family 
 group in their primary years and until
 they are old enough to ride a motor   
 vehicle they depend on their parents' 
 goodwill in driving them to clubs,    
 discos etc.Very few homes are without 
 television ,some also having video    
 recorders. Some families have a       
 computer.Labour saving machines are in
 general use, cleaners, washing        
 machines, dishwashers,food mixers and 
 deep freezes.                         
   Cats and dogs are the most popular  
 pets.When land is available ponies and
 horses may be kept for hacking or     
 hunting                               </content>
