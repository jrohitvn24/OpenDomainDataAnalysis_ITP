		<title>15SPORTS'DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     Each year we have two Sports' Days
 in our school.  The first of these is 
 our own school.  We used to have the  
 Juniors and Infants together on one   
 day but now because there are so many 
 children in our school we have them on
 separate days.  Each child takes part 
 in a race and we are in four houses.  
 We have ordinary running races and    
 then other races like skipping races, 
 dressing-up races, relay races and one
 lap of the field races.  We also have 
 a tug of war where two teams pull on a
 rope and the one who pulls the middle 
 of the rope into their half is the    
 winner.                               
     The second Sports' Day is our     
 school who competes against our       
 neighbouring school - St. Mark's.  We 
 have races against each other but     
 there is no winner - it is just for   
 fun.                                  </content>
