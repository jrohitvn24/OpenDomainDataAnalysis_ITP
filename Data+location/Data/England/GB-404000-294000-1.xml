		<content> Two thirds of this area is in the     
 Sandwell district of Walsall, while   
 the remaining third consists of parts 
 of the Great Barr and Kingstanding    
 areas of Birmingham to the south west 
 of Sutton Park.                       
   The residential areas of Walsall    
 merge with those in Birmingham, having
 been developed steadily during the    
 last sixty years. The four most       
 northerly squares, located in Walsall,
 are mainly farmland- mostly rough     
 grazing and cultivated grassland with 
 some arable land. Bordering on the    
 farmland are extensive hospital       
 grounds, a golf course and several    
 sports grounds which are in use most  
 weekends.The south westerly section of
 the area includes Junction 7 of the M6
 which connects with other routes. In  
 the south east lies a small but       
 concentrated light industrial area.   </content>
