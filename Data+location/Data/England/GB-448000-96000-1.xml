		<title>01INTRODUCING OUR D BLOCK</title>
		<content> The block 04480096 is situated on the 
 extreme north coast of the Isle of    
 Wight. The block is almost evenly     
 divided by the mouth of the River     
 Medina and the major part of the block
 is comprised of the sea, part of the  
 Solent.The area is predominantly      
 urban- light industrial,commercial and
 residential. The town is noted for its
 close links with the sea and is known 
 as the yachting centre of the         
 world.The area is subject to seasonal 
 variation and is also suffering from  
 unemployment due to the present       
 economic climate. Many of the light   
 industries service the yachting       
 community and are situated on the     
 shores of the Medina.Cowes is linked  
 to the mainland by ferry and hydrofoil
 services and East and West Cowes are  
 connected by a chain ferry.
