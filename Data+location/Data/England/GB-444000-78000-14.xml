		<title>14Farming at Atherfield</title>
		<content> Atherfield Green Farm is just under   
 100 acres.It was bought by the grand- 
 father of the present owner in 1915.  
 When the owner's father farmed the    
 land as a young man he used heavy     
 horses.Tractors didn't come along     
 until 1935.At this time the farm      
 produced vegetables,cereals and grass.
 It also had a herd of Shorthorn cows  
 which were milked by hand.The farm    
 employed 10-15 men but with the advent
 of machinery this was cut to 2.Now    
 they no longer milk cows,they rear    
 barley fed bulls for beef,grow all the
 corn they eat and some potatoes.They  
 also make silage and a small amount of
 hay for the horses they keep for      
 riding.The farm is almost self-       
 sufficient buying only protein for the
 cattle,fuel for the tractor and       
 fertilizer for the land.
