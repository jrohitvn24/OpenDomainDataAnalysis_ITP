		<title>19A TYPICAL HOLIDAY ACCOUNT</title>
		<content> My wife and I, our daughter-in-law,   
 son and their two daughters aged 11   
 and 5, travelled to Mullion from      
 Suffolk in two cars. We chose Mullion 
 for our 14-day holiday as it is       
 different scenically from East Anglia.
 We stayed at Trenance Farm. The       
 outbuildings had been converted to    
 living accommodation and additional   
 new chalets had been built. Each had 3
 bedrooms,bathroom, a kitchen and a    
 lounge/diner.They were all designed   
 for self-catering.Laundry facilities  
 were available in the main building.  
 Food could be bought in the local     
 shops.Most days were spent in nearby  
 Polurrian Cove with safe bathing. We  
 walked along stretches of the coastal 
 path. Most days we had picnic lunches 
 but occasionally ate meals in a local 
 pub.Occasional visits were made to    
 Cadgwith, the Lizard and Kynance Cove.</content>
