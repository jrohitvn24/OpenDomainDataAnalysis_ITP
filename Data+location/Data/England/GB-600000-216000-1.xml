 Our block is a rural agricultural     
 area,including part of the village of 
{Abberton}and{Langenhoe.               
{                                      
{Langenhoe}is four miles from          
{Colchester.}Some people work in the   
 village but most work in{Colchester.  
 For the people who have not got a car 
 a half hourly bus service goes into   
{Colchester.}There are a few street    
 lights along the main road but they   
 are not very noticeable. There is a   
 school for children from four to      
 eleven in the village but after eleven
 years children have to go to a        
{Colchester}secondary school. The      
 nearest doctor is in a nearby village.
 There is a village shop.
