		<title>14A HEADCORN CHILD'S WEEKEND</title>
		<content> This is how we spend a weekend. Some  
 of the family like to have a lie-in.  
 At weekends they stay in bed a little 
 longer. For breakfast on Saturday we  
 usually have something light like     
 cereal or a piece of toast. Some times
 we spend Saturday morning shopping for
 the rest of the week,usually going    
 into Maidstone or Ashford to the      
 supermarket or shopping centre. Many  
 people still refer to Sunday as a day 
 of rest but others use it as a work   
 day,probably working in their garden  
 or cleaning the car. For lunch on     
 Sunday we have a larger meal than     
 usual,often roast meat. In the        
 after-noon we sometimes go for a walk 
 through the fields using the public   
 footpaths or perhaps we just relax    
 and watch television. My older brother
 has homework to do before school again
 on Monday,but I enjoy my Sundays.     </content>
