		<content>{The River Wharfe}rises very quickly,  
 though it rarely causes disruption    
 on the roads in mid-Wharfedale.       
 The{fish}in the river include         
 naturally bred game fish and fish     
 introduced from breeding pools at     
{Barden.}Permits to fish are expensive.
{The Strid,}at grid ref. 04070456, is a
 very narrow and very deep rock channel
 of the river, and very dangerous. When
 in spate it is not as dangerous as    
 when low, ref. Wordsworth's poem "The 
 White Doe of Rylestone". The river is 
 a popular{tourist}attraction. There   
 are specially laid out{Nature Trails  
 along its banks, through Strid Wood,  
 and public footpaths on both sides.   
 There is only a litle pollution from  
 farm effluent now.
