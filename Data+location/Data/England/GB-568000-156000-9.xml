		<title>09Ditton Funday</title>
		<content> On Sunday 7th July it was Ditton      
 Funday at the Community Centre. There 
 was a procession of decorated floats  
 and people in fancy dress. Stalls were
 set up round an arena. At 3.30 there  
 were children's sports. In the hall   
 were things that adults and children  
 had made for competitions (cakes,     
 flower displays, art etc.). In another
 part of the hall a clown was doing    
 tricks and there were shows such as   
 Jack &amp; the Beanstalk. Outside was the 
 Custard Pie Championship. Teams in    
 fancy dress had to throw pies at each 
 other. It was very funny to watch. In 
 the Egg-Hurling competition you had to
 throw an egg and your partner had to  
 catch it without it smashing. Over on 
 the other side of the field, people   
 were trying to put up a hot-air       
 balloon. Finally they did get it into 
 the air.      - Kerri, aged 10.-      </content>
