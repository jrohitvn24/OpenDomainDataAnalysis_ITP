		<title>15PETS KEPT BY CORBY FAMILIES.</title>
		<content>No pets at all: 13% of all households. 
Pet owners: no correlation between pets
kept and the number of children in the 
house.                                 
The dog was the most popular animal.   
1-child homes: 1.Dogs(26%) 2.Goldfish  
2-child homes: 1.Dogs(19%) 2.Rabbits   
3-child homes: 1.Dogs(39%) 2.Cats      
64% of all pets were kept because their
owners liked them. Some dogs were kept 
for security and protection.           
Costs per week were: Dogs #4.30, Cats  
#3, rabbits only #1.50 to keep (food   
mainly). Dog licence cost 37p for one  
year.                                  
All pets were given special pet foods. 
Additionally, 31% ate scraps and 7% of 
dogs had fresh meat. Pets were fed     
twice daily; young pets more often.
