		<content> ECONOMICS There is neither a bank     
 nor a buiding society. The Sub-Post   
 Office in Woodseaves is the only one  
 still functioning,the Sub-Post Office 
 which formerly existed in Shebdon     
 having closed and reverted to a       
 dwelling.                             
    The rateable value of a typical    
 dwelling is Â£300 which requires a     
 total payment of Â£456  per year.      
 Included in this is a payment of      
 2.1 pence per pound of rateable value 
 to the High Offley parish council.    
 The cost of travelling to Stafford by 
 bus is 65p.single and Â£1.20 return.   
   An average dwelling costs Â£35,000   
 and the price of agricultural land    
 is Â£1500 to Â£2000 per acre.
