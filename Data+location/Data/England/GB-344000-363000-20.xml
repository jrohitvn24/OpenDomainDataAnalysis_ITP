		<title>20Christleton Village Pond</title>
		<content> Since 1974 groups of children have    
 carried out an active conservation    
 project on this ancient marl pit now  
 pond.Initially a historical survey and
 census of the wildlife was carried out
 and won 2nd place in the Save the     
 Village Pond Campaign.However since   
 the droughts of 1975/6 a pond rescue  
 has taken place.Each year ditches and 
 drainage channels are cleaned,surplus 
 reeds, rushes and floating vegetation 
 removed,and the edges reshaped to     
 allow more depth of water and improve 
 access.Trees and shrubs have been     
 planted,grassbanks cut and the fence  
 maintained.The aim is to recreate  a  
 visual amenity for the village and to 
 provide a safe nesting site for Mute  
 Swans the village emblem.Marl was     
 originally dug to fertilise the areas 
 sandy soil,or to make local bricks.   
 Sand was also extracted for building. </content>
