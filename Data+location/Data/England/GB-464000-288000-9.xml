		<content>  There are no{health}clinics,dentists 
 or{doctors}in Mowsley or Laughton.Most
 people from Laughton and some from    
 Mowsley go to the Kibworth surgery,the
 rest to Husbands Bosworth.Both        
 surgeries have a nurse and hold       
 regular ante-natal and baby clinics.  
  Most people go to Market Harborough  
 or Leicester for{dentists,}but some go
 to Rugby, Uppingham and Derby. People 
 moving into the area tend to keep     
 their previous dentist .              
  The primary school has visits from   
 local health nurses to check teeth,   
 nails and hair(for head lice).The     
 children have{medical examinations}   
 when they begin and finish school.The 
 school has no dental inspections.     
  There are no major health problems,  
 although mild bronchial and catarrhal 
 infections are more frequent than in  
 some areas.                           </content>
