		<content>  The area around Dudmaston Hall is    
{"The Dingle".}It is a piece of        
 landscaping by Walter Wood, similar to
 that of William Shenstone at his home 
 in Halesowen. The land surrounding the
 Hall is grazed by sheep.              
  While the majority of the{deciduous  
{trees (oak, beech, lime)}contribute to
 the ornamental effect, they are also  
 part of this century's afforestation  
 plans. They are the culmination of    
 Geoffrey Wolryche's forestry plans    
 between 1908 and 1969. A large number 
 of the elm trees have been cut down   
 due to the effects of Dutch elm       
 disease.                              
  The{National Trust}are currently     
 engaged in restoring the Mill Pool at 
 the foot of the Dingle. The large     
{man-made lake,}built in 1834, used to 
 supply water to the estate . It was 3 
 separate pools until linked in 1837.  </content>
