		<title>05GENERAL FARMING IN YALDING</title>
		<content>                                       
 Land quality, wind effect and frost   
 pockets influence location of crops.  
 There is a limited area of water      
 meadow close to the Medway and Beult  
 rivers. Behind these, much of the land
 now has corn, soft fruit and hops,    
 interspersed with orchards. Towards   
 the higher ground of the greensand    
 ridge the more sensitive top fruits   
 (pears and plums) can be grown. Only a
 small proportion of land in scattered 
 fields is given over to managed       
 grassland, other than the water       
 meadows. Local farming is undergoing  
 change. Older apple orchards, with    
 large trees spaced widely are being   
 replaced by smaller trees spaced      
 closely, being easier to tend and     
 pick. The grower seeks also to        
 increase the crop to meet competition 
 from overseas, notably France.        </content>
