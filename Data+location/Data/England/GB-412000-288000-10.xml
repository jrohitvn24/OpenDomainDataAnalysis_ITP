		<content>Many people are involved in the care of
the health of a community.They work as 
a team.The health visitor plays a      
central part in the work of this team. 
Mrs Millard works at Dreghorn Rd.clinic
after training for 5 years and has been
at the clinic for 8 years. For 3 after-
noons a week she holds baby clinics and
parentcraft classes to prepare and     
advise young mothers.She and another   
health vistor try to see 10 families a 
day in the their homes but this depends
on their problems.They keep birth and  
general development records of children
who are immunised against such things  
as Dip.,Tet.,Polio. With this standard 
of  care the community is generally a  
healthy one.However problems do exist. 
Amongst babies it is often due to      
incorrect feeding,teenages may suffer  
through drug abuse and the elderly may 
not eat or keep warm.                  </content>
