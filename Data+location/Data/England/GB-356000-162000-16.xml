		<title>16Chew Magna Reservoir</title>
		<content> Chew Magna Reservoir, a compensatory  
 reservoir to the rear of Broadcroft,  
 was built in 1845 by the eminent      
 Victorian engineer, James Simpson.It  
 was then part of a scheme which took  
 water from the Mendips near Chewton   
 Mendip down to Bristol. The reservoir 
 has an earth bank and the floor is of 
 puddle-clay core which acts as a      
 membrane against the passage of water.
 It is drained by a scour-pipe, the    
 overflow being on the Broadcroft side.
 If needed,water is pumped at night    
 into Chew Valley Lake when the cost of
 electricity is at its cheapest.       
 At the moment Bristol Waterworks have 
 drained out the water and are lining  
 the scour-pipe with a plastic lining, 
 renewing a valve, putting a concrete  
 base in the stilling pond, making a   
 new access road and making the crest  
 of the dam wider.                     </content>
