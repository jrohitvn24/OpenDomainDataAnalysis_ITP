 Although not far from a large city and
 in a good farming area there was some 
 evidence of wild life . In the fields 
 were fox holes and footprints in many 
 mud patches. A wet early summer meant 
 that the landscape was very           
 green.There were many magpies,crows   
 and cuckoos.Rabbits and their burrows 
 were seen at Primrose                 
 Cottage.Butterflies(Red               
 Admiral,Painted Lady and Cabbage      
 White) were seen.Wild flowers were in 
 abundance ,including Buttercups       
 ,Poppies ,Dogroses ,Moondaisies and   
 elderflower
