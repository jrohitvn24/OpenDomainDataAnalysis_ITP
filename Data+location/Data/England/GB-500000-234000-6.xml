		<title>06MOUNT HILL FLITWICK'S CASTLE</title>
		<content>     BEFORE THE CONQUEST OF 1066       
 FLITWICK WAS OWNED BY ALWIN,THEN IT   
 WAS TAKEN OVER BY WILLIAM LOVETT,WHO  
 PROBABLY BUILT THE 'MOUNT'. MOUNT HILL
 IS A FIGURE OF EIGHT VERSION OF THE   
 FIMILIAR MOTTE AND BAILEY,TIMBER AND  
 EARTH FORTRESS. IT STANDS ON A HILL   
 OVERLOOKING WHAT WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN 
 THE MAIN ROAD THROUGH FLITWICK.       
     NOWADAYS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO  
 SUGGEST THERE WERE ANY BUILDINGS ON   
 THE MOUNT. THE DITCHES ON THE EAST    
 SIDE HAVE BEEN FILLED IN AND ONLY PART
 OF THE MOUND STILL REMAINS. THE SITE  
 IS NOW USED AS A PUBLIC OPEN SPACE AND
 IS SURROUNDED BY RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS
 THE MOUNT IS 34 METRES IN DIAMETER,AND
 ABOUT 7 METRES HIGH. THE MOAT IS 3    
 METRES DEEP. TREES NOW GROW ON AND    
 AROUND THE MOTTE.
