		<title>14The Families in our School(2</title>
		<content> In 1985 a lot of mothers work during  
 the day. We did a survey in our school
 to find out how many mothers did work.
 We worked it out that 78% of mothers  
 did work.Some of this work is part    
 time. Some people find this a cause   
 for social concern, others think it   
 makes children more adaptable and is  
 good for them.                        
   In 1985 the average number of       
 children in a family is 2.6 but the   
 number of children in a family does   
 vary from one child to five.          
   When we did the survey we also found
 out the position of the child in the  
 family. There are 24 eldest children  
 and there are 18 youngest children in 
 our school. The average age of the    
 parents is 33.
