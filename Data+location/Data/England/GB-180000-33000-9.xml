		<title>09THE BOWLING GREEN</title>
		<content>    The Bowling Green was a gift from  
 Mr Trefusis, it is 70m long by 30m    
 wide and is mostly grass.A committee  
 was formed in 1964 there object was to
 transform the rough ground for the    
 people of the village. Although there 
 is no record of bowls being played ,  
 the name suggests that the game was   
 played here centuries ago.Now on the  
 edge of the Green there is a          
 childrens play area,a public          
 convinience and a tea room. The       
 Bowling Green is unique as it has a   
 300 degrees view of the surrounding   
 land.                                 
    During the 1982 Tall Ships Race    
 the best views of the fireworks       
 display at Falmouth docks were seen   
 from the Bowling Green.
