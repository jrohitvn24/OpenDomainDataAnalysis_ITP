We have a fairly big school.It holds an
approximate population of a hundred and
seventy children.Quite a few people    
come from Grendon to the school,but    
most come from nearby villages,the     
names of which are, Marsh Gibbon,      
Twyford,Charndon, Ludgershall and      
Edgcott.Also, a few people come from   
the Springhill Prison Estate,just      
outside the village.                   
    We used to have eight classes      
altogether,but now we only have six.   
    We have an assembly hall,which we  
also use as a dinner hall.We also have 
five separate buildings.Two are used   
for the infants,one is the P.E.store,  
and one,which used to be a science     
room,but as we do not use it for       
science any more it is a classroom     
once again.
