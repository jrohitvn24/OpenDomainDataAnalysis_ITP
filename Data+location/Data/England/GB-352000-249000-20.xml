		<title>20A walk in Bodenham village.</title>
		<content>  St Michael's church to Chapel Lane.  
 Leaving the lych gate we walk up the  
 cobbled path towards the primary      
 school. Here, in the oldest part of   
 the village,are well kept halftimbered
 houses. Walking on past the school to 
 the Well we come to a T junction.Going
 right, we follow the road to the five 
 footed bridge. On the right is the    
 smithy.Here the houses are brick. The 
 river Lugg flows brown beneath the    
 hump of the bridge. Past fields, then 
 Dunfield Road branches to the right.  
 On our right is the Millbrook which   
 joins the Lugg a little further on.   
 Here is the new estate.We turn right  
 down Brockington Road and walk past   
 houses until we reach the green.At the
 cross road on the left is the surgery 
 and on the right Siward James Close.We
 turn left, then right and walking past
 the shops come to Chapel Lane.        </content>
