		<title>15COHAM HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Coham family has been connected   
 with Black Torrington since 1100.     
 Coham House was first built then and  
 rebuilt in 1700 and 1865. The present 
 house is mainly Victorian. It stands  
 in a wooded setting a kilometre north 
 west of the village and belongs to Mr 
 and Mrs Coham-Fleming. It contains    
 several pictures and antiques, but    
 many were burnt in a fire in 1978. The
 family coat of arms contains Arscott, 
 Coham, Bickford and Holland symbols.  
 Once many servants were employed but  
 now there is only a housekeeper. The  
 house is reputed to be haunted by the 
 Blue Lady, who died after her brother 
 was killed.  The beautiful woods were 
 planted 150 years ago, on the slopes  
 between the house and the Torridge.   
 Coham House is not open to the public,
 but Larks and Sparks are held annually
 on the Hams beside the river.         </content>
