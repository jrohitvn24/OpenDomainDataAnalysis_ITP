		<content> Predominantly a wooded area mostly of 
 oak and some coniferous plantations. A
 source of tributaries of the river    
 Arun with adjacent water meadows. It  
 is crossed by the B2133 with its      
 ribbon development through the north  
 of Loxwood and the older parts of     
 Alfold village including the 13th     
 century church, Loxwood Hall in the SE
 of the area has developed into a smart
 residential area with some substantial
 housing. In Alfold village the        
 adjacent land is mostly mixed farming 
 in the control of a charity. The      
 Merchant Seamans re-habilitation      
 centre with its own convalescent home 
 and retirement houses. Some training  
 is given in agriculture and           
 horticulture. The remainder of the    
 area is sparsely occupied with most   
 houses residential and substantial.
