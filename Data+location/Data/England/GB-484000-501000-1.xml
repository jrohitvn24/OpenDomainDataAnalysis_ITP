		<title>01Goathland Moor Area</title>
		<content> The block is predominantly heather    
 covered moorland, with a large area in
 the east covered in coniferous        
 plantations.  The moors drop fairly   
 steeply to the south west towards the 
 Eller Beck valley and Goathland.  The 
 extreme north east drops gently to the
 grass fields of the Little Beck       
 valley.  the are no residents in the  
 block but the moors are used for bee  
 keeping and grouse shooting as well as
 forestry.  The main A169 passes       
 through the block so the are is well  
 used by tourists who stop to admire   
 the scenery or by walkers on the      
 potpaths.  The moor are also used year
 round for sheep grazing.
