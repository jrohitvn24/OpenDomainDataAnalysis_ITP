		<title>15HARLESTON HOUSE - LOWESTOFT</title>
		<content>Harleston House was opened in 1945 and 
is run by the Church Army. It is a home
for elderly people and it has 30       
residents, each with their own bedroom.
The oldest resident is 102 and the     
youngest is 67. The rents are set by   
the council at 110 pounds per week. The
pensions are collected for the         
residents. The residents enjoy         
knitting, sewing, embroidery and       
gardening. The house is set in a large 
garden and there are rooms for         
visitors. If anyone is ill at night    
there is a bell in each room which is  
connected to the office - there is a   
doctors surgery nearby. Harleston House
is a lovely building and everybody     
seemed very happy there.
