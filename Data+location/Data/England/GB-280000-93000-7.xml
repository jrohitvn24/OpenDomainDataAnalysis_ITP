		<content>{Summer Term.}The best fun is sports   
 day, but we also do swimming, have    
 a swimming gala, go on outings and    
 take part in the area sports at       
 Shobrooke. What is not so good is     
 reports! At the end of the school year
 there is an end of term service, led  
 by all the school leavers before going
 to secondary school.{Autumn Term.}We  
 have a harvest thanksgiving service in
 the chapel next to the school and     
 bring things like fruit, vegetables   
 and cakes. At Christmas we have       
 parties and entertainment which we do 
 for our parents.{Spring Term.}The     
 football and netball teams play in    
 tournaments. This year some of us went
 to the Wembworthy Centre for a week's 
 residential and science course.{All   
{Year.}The dentist and school doctor   
 come regularly, so does the school    
 nurse.                                </content>
