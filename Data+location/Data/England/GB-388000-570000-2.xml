		<content> THERE ARE NO CENTRES OF EMPLOYMENT IN 
 THE VILLAGE.  THUS, APART FROM SERVICE
 WORKERS, ALL COMMUTE DAILY TO HEXHAM, 
 MORPETH OR NEWCASTLE.  THE{OCCUPATIONS
 OF THE WORKING INHABITANTS VARY       
 CONSIDERABLY; THE INDIGENOUS OCCUPA-  
 TIONS INCLUDE FARM OR LAND OWNERS AND 
 ESTATE WORKERS. {REDUNDANCY}IS CAUSING
 CONSTERNATION BECAUSE OF TRAVELLING   
 DIFFICULTIES AND 'TIED HOUSES'.  SOME 
 INDIVIDUALS HAVE STARTED THEIR OWN    
 CONTRACT FARMING BUSINESS AND 1 OR 2  
 WORK ABROAD.  SEASONAL WORK IS UN-    
 SATISFACTORY FOR THE BREADWINNER.     
 THERE ARE MANY WOMEN WHO WORK FROM    
 NECESSITY OR FROM CHOICE.  THE VILLAGE
 HAS A NUMBER OF{RETIRED}PEOPLE INCLUD-
 ING SOME WHO HAVE TAKEN EARLY RETIRE- 
 MENT.  TOURISM IS AN EXPANDING SOURCE 
 OF EMPLOYMENT OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE 
 TO SOME OF THE DECLINING TRADITIONAL  
 FORMS OF VILLAGE WORK.                </content>
