		<title>17CHALFONT ST GILES CHURCH</title>
		<content>ST Giles'Church,which stands behind    
the houses surrounding the village     
green ,is an old stone and flint build-
ing,the nave dating from the 12th cent-
ury.It is reached through a lych gate. 
Inside the church,the chancel and the  
octagonal font are 13th century,while  
the beautifully carved pews are 14th.  
There are some rare mediaeval wall     
paintings which were discovered under  
whitewash when the church was renovated
in the 1920s.There are many Masons     
Marks which were the 'signatures' of   
the craftsmen who built the church.The 
original six bells were recently       
augmented to eight.Above the south     
porch is a wood carving of St Giles,   
patron saint of lepers,cripples and    
blacksmiths.
