		<title>19EMPLOYMENT OF SCHOOL PUPILS</title>
		<content> A large number of the pupils who      
 attend the High Schools in the area   
 have evening and Saturday jobs.These  
 provide the children with additional  
 pocket money or as extra income for   
 their families.                       
 The usual range of work is undertaken 
 including newspaper delivery,shop work
 and milk delivery but Blackpool       
 provides a whole host of other jobs,  
 some of which prove to be most        
 lucrative.Many pupils help in the     
 hotels and guest houses run by their  
 parents or by other people.Others find
 work on the Pleasure Beach or in the  
 numerous cafes and snack bars that    
 abound on or near the promenade.      
 Whilst most of the pupils receive a   
 fair rate of pay and work within the  
 permitted number of hours there are a 
 considerable number who are exploited 
 and break the permitted hours laws.   </content>
