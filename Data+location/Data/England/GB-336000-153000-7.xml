		<content>   OUR JOURNEY OFF THE A38 THROUGH     
BIDDISHAM VILLAGE WAS ALONG A ROAD NEW 
TO THOSE OF US TAKING PART.            
   FOR THE FIRST KILOMETRE WE PASSED   
LARGE COTTAGES SET IN THEIR OWN GROUNDS
AMID FLOWERS,FRUIT TREES AND           
VEGETABLES.WE LEFT THE HOUSES TO FIND  
THE ROAD FOLLOWING THE COURSE OF THE   
OLD RIVER AXE.THE WAS FULL AS IT       
TWISTED AND FURNED TO JOIN THE MAIN    
RIVER.                                 
   THE FIELDS ALONG SIDE THE RIVER WERE
RICH WITH GRASS.SOME FIELDS HAD BEEN   
CROPPED AND BALES OF HAY WERE AWAITING 
COLLECTION.                            
   COWS BROWSED ALONGSIDE THE RIVER OR 
LAY CONTENDEDLY CHEWING.               
   WITH THE SUN SHINNING,THE LANDSCAPE 
INVITED US TO LINGER RATHER THAN TO    
CONTINUE OUR EXPLORATION.
