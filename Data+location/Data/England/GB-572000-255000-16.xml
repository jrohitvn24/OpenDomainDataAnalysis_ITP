community. Most were members of the    
community council or of one of the     
religious groups. 30% of the sample

flower garden &amp; many a vegetable patch.

members, the Happy Hours 70, Womens'   
Institute 45, Indoor Bowls and Snooker

attend Adult Education Classes at local
centres or use Sports Halls nearby.
