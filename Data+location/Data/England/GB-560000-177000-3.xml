		<title>03HANGMANS WOOD, GRAYS</title>
		<content>  Hangmans Wood is on a ridge above the
 Thames river.It is in an angle formed 
 by the A1013 to Southend and the      
 A1089 going to Chadwell St. Mary.The  
 name 'Hangmans Wood' suggests that    
 people were hanged in the wood,but    
 there is no record of any such        
 events.The name is also thought to    
 come from the fact that the trees     
 seemed to hang over the river.The wood
 may have first been called Hanging    
 Wood but over the years changed to    
 Hangmans Wood.                        
  The wood is about four acres big and 
 consists of deciduous trees. Another  
 feature of the wood is the presence of
{deneholes.}There are three remaining  
 ones which are fenced for safety, and 
 several more which have been filled   
 in.
