		<title>08THE NATIONAL TRUST</title>
		<content>   The most common mistake people make 
 about the National Trust is they think
 it is run or owned by the government. 
 But this is not true.Since the end of 
 the Second World War 2,400,000 acres  
 of the countryside have disappeared   
 under concrete.During that time the   
 Trust has acquired 344,000 acres which
 it now protects.Before the National   
 Trust accepts a property there must be
 money left with the estate.This is to 
 pay for repairs ,if neccessary.When   
 the National Trust accepted Dunham    
 Hall it was very neglected.The late   
 Lord Stamford had lived in a small    
 part of the house and although most of
 the rest of the house was packed up   
 and locked away,the contents and rooms
 remained untouched for several        
 decades.The N.T. is today the largest 
 conservation group in Britain and the 
 country's largest private landowner.  </content>
