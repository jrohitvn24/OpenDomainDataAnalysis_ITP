		<content>   THE BEST THING ABOUT LIVING IN      
 CHRISTCHURCH IS THE BEAUTY OF DRUITT  
 GARDENS, NAMED AFTER MR DRUITT.  THERE
 IS A PATH GOING ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE 
 GARDENS WHICH IS A COBBLED FOOTPATH.  
 THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF BEAUTIFUL      
 TREES, SOME OF WHICH BLOSSOM.         
 EVERYONE LIKES THIS CHARMING PLACE    
 WITH ITS LOVELY WILDLIFE.             
   I THINK THE UGLIEST THINGS ARE THE  
 DIRTY NOISE OF THE CARS AS THEY GO    
 WHIZZING BY, THE DULL BUILDINGS AND   
 THE WORKMEN DIGGING UP THE ROAD, DOING
 THE SEWAGE.  I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THEY
 HAVE MADE THE ROUNDABOUT LONGER BUT AT
 LEAST IT HAS SHRUBS AND PLANTS GROWING
 ON IT.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
