		<title>03TRAFFIC AROUND OUR AREA</title>
		<content>   The majority of the traffic recorded
 went along the{B3179}towards{Budleigh 
{Salterton}.This means that this is a  
 popular route across the common.      
   Quite a few Heavy Goods Vehicles    
 were using the B roads,they were      
 probably going to the{ECC quarry at   
{Blackhill}or to{Exmouth Docks.}Some of
 them were from smaller companies in   
 this area (e.g. bakery and building   
 merchants).                           
   The majority of the traffic recorded
 were private cars (84% of all traffic)
 Of which over half carried only one   
 person.This shows that they were      
 probably shoppers or sales            
 representatives.                      
   Generally we were surprised at the  
 traffic passing through{Woodbury}on   
 the B roads at this time in the       
 afternoon.                            
                                       </content>
