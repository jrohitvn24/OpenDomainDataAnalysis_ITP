		<content>      Deep Pool Farm used to have 200  
 acres of land but now it only has 50  
 acres because the owners sold off the 
 unwanted land. In the winter they keep
 bullocks in one of their fields. In   
 their very large back garden which is 
 not part of the farm, they keep a lot 
 of petones. When the owners, Mr. and  
 Mrs.Gabriel, owned all of the 200     
 acres they had a brood of hens.       
      Another farm in our area is      
 called Border Farm. The owners kept   
 cows, goats, horses, and guinea       
 fowls.
