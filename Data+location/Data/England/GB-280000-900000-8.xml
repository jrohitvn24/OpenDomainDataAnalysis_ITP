		<title>08Golspie Fire Station.</title>
		<content>    Golspie Fire Station was built in  
 1976.Before that the fire engine used 
 to be housed in a garage in Seaforth  
 Rd.The new building is modern.It has  
 an area to house the fire-engine,a    
 lecture room,kitchen and toilets.     
   There are nine part-time firemen,   
 each of them have another full-time   
 job,and a sub-officer based at the    
 station. Each fireman is supplied with
 a bleeper and when there is a fire,   
 each man's bleeper goes off.Before the
 firemen were issued with bleepers,a   
 siren used to go off and it could be  
 heard all over the village.           
   Every Tuesday night the firemen     
 attend lectures and practise routines 
 at the fire station.                  
   Most calls are to chimney fires and 
 heath fires.
