		<title>06ST DAVIDS ESTATE</title>
		<content>THIS IS A LARGE PRE-WAR COUNCIL ESTATE 
WITH VERY FEW AMENITIES OF ANY         
DESCRIPTION FOR RESIDENTS. THE ESTATE  
IS IN A RUN-DOWN CONDITION WITH A FEW  
HOUSES AND GARDENS WELL KEPT, BUT MOST 
NOT. THERE WERE MANY DOGS ROAMING THE  
STREETS WITH DROPPINGS, GLASS AND PAPER
LITTERING THE PAVEMENTS. PEOPLE INTER- 
VIEWED SAID THEY WOULD LIKE MORE PLAY  
AREAS FOR THE CHILDREN.THERE WAS NOT A 
LOT OF TRAFFIC ON THE ESTATE.          
BETWEEN CRANFORD RD. AND BOUGHTON GREEN
RD.CONSISTED OF PRIVATE TERRACED HOUSES
QUITE A STABLE AREA WITH FEW UNOCCUPIED
PROPERTIES. THE CUL-DE-SACS GAVE VERY  
PEACEFUL, SECLUDED RESIDENTIAL AREAS   
ALTHOUGH CAR PARKING COULD BE A PROBLEM
BECAUSE FEW HOUSES HAD A GARAGE OR     
GARAGE SPACE.
