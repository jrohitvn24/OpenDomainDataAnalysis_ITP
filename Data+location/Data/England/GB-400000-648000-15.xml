		<title>15Local History,Scremerston.</title>
		<content>     The earliest documentary reference
 to Scremerston is about{1130}when the 
 spelling is shown as{Scrimestan.}     
     In{1249 }the lord of the manor of 
 Scremerston,{Sir William de           
{Scremerston}was a{Border Commissioner.
     The village was completely        
 destroyed by the Scots in{1386}but was
 later rebuilt.The tower or fortalice  
 of Scremerston is mentioned in{1416   
 but by {1542} was described as{"a     
{greate-old toure much decayed".       
     When the plague visited           
 Scremerston in {1667 }the sick were   
 taken down to the links on the        
 seashore where huts were erected from 
 the bent growing there.               
     Coal seems to have been worked in 
 Scremerston from an early period but  
 all the mines closed about 45 years   
 ago.                                  
                                       </content>
