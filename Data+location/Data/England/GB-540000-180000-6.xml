		<content>    Most children wake up at half past 
 seven. They watch breakfast TV. The   
 boys always come early to play        
 football. The girls come much later   
 and walk around the playground. When  
 the whistle goes we come in.          
    We put our coats and bags in the   
 cloakroom and go down the corridor. We
 go in class and get our reading books 
 out. Then we have maths. That takes us
 up to playtime. The boys play throw   
 the ball, the girls walk around. After
 play we play a game of rounders. When 
 we come in it is about a quarter to   
 twelve. We get changed and go to      
 dinner. At half past twelve we come   
 out of the dinner hall. Play ends at  
 twenty past one.                      
    In the afternoon we have art. At   
 half past two it is playtime. After   
 play we have a story then we go home.
