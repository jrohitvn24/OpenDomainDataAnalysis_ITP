		<content> A rather pretentious word for our area
 but we do get a lot of visitors.      
 Ardely is in the Shell Book of English
 Villages &amp; similar publications &amp; with
 its village green, oak tree, pond &amp;   
 well is on the tourist circuit. Both  
 churches are referred to in 'Pevesner'
 as is a 17 century dovecote &amp; mill    
 dating from 1828 in Walkern. The      
 church in Walkern has a Norman        
 doorway, a 14 century tower &amp; a 13    
 century Purbeck marble effigy. That in
 Ardeley has traces of the original    
 Norman church at the base of the tower
 carved angels with outspread wings in 
 the roof of nave (13 century) &amp; early 
 15 century font with the bowl dating  
 back to the 12 century. Ardeley Bury, 
 the big house, is not open to the     
 public but can be seen from the       
 surrounding countryside. The original 
 Tudor House was made 'gothic' in 1820.</content>
