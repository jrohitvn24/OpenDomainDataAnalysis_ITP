		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF CLAIRE</title>
		<content> I get up and get ready for school. My 
 older sister goes to Bottisham Village
 College, my younger sister and I go to
 Swaffham Prior School. I walk to      
 school. There are 24 children in my   
 class, 12 3rd years and 12 4th years. 
 On summer mornings we go swimming in  
 groups in the school pool. At playtime
 I have skipping competitions with my  
 friend. In the afternoon we have      
 crafts . Some Mums and local ladies   
 come in to help. Some of us are       
 knitting jumpers for children in      
 Ethiopia. We have over 50 so far. I go
 home and watch TV. I go swimming in   
 Bottisham Pool
