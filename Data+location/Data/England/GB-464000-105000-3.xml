		<title>03Cosham House</title>
		<content>  One of the important large houses is 
 Cosham House which stands on the      
 corner of Burrill Avenue and Havant   
 Road. The present house probably dates
 to the 18th Century though it is      
 believed to have replaced a previous  
 one on the same site. The are some    
 flint outhouses and boundary walls.   
  There are more than twenty rooms     
 including a large 40 feet long lounge 
 with bay windows looking onto lawns.  
 There is an interesting railway style 
 verandah. There are some original     
 kitchen paving slabs and a cool cellar
 which is now used to store wine but   
 would have been used meat and general 
 provisions. There is an acre of ground
 which includes some rare and listed   
 trees.
