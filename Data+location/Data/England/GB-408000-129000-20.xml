		<title>20A Child's Day in Wilton</title>
		<content> When I woke up my baby sister was     
 crying so I gave her a bottle and got 
 dressed and cleaned my teeth and      
 washed my face. I went back to the    
 bathroom to fetch my sister. I took   
 her nappy off because it was wet. I   
 packed my school bag, brushed my shoes
 and had my breakfast before Robin, my 
 brother, came down with Mummy and     
 Laura. At school we went to see the   
 Mayor and the previous Mayor for the  
 Domesday Project. Then we went back to
 school for a playtime before starting 
 to write this. It will be lunch time  
 at 12:00 and we go home at 3:00. I    
 will have time to play before dinner  
 and watch TV. Before I go to sleep I  
 will think what to dream about_ pear  
 trees, maybe, or Spring.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
