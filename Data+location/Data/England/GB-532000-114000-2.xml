		<content> This is an area of undulating lowland 
 nestling under the South Downs where  
 the soil is mainly fertile greensand, 
 perfect for growing crops and garden  
 plants. Wild flowers abound such as   
 ragwort,meadowsweet,willow herb,vetch,
 cornflower,daisy,buttercup,primrose,  
 bluebell,clover and campion.Poppies   
 are appearing after an absence of     
 several years.Local birds include     
 chaffinch,wren,sparrow,starling,hedge 
 sparrow,various tits,goldfinch,black- 
 bird and thrust.Butterflies are       
 becoming rare but the red admiral,    
 peacock,brimstone,orange tip,meadow   
 brown and tortoise shell can be seen. 
 People are becoming interested in con-
 serving the countryside and walking is
 a popular pastime.Old footpaths are   
 being kept open and styles are        
 repaired so that everybody is able to 
 gain access to fields and woods.      </content>
