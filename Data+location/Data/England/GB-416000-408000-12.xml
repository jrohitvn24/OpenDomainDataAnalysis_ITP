		<title>12New Mill Gala.</title>
		<content> Much of village recreation is         
 self-generated.The annual village gala
 is the culmination of great deal of   
 effort throughout the previous        
 year.The gala committee meet regularly
 to plan the day's events.On the       
 evening before and the morning of the 
 Gala a small army of volunteers       
 prepare the site.The great day itself 
 begins with a parade of decorated     
 floats and people in fancy dress.This 
 is led by Hepworth Brass Band.At the  
 field the Gala Queen is crowned and   
 the afternoon fun begins.There are    
 displays to watch such as Majorettes  
 and Steel Bands.A variety of side     
 shows(roll-a-penny,bran tub,tombola   
 etc.)provide amusement and raise funds
 for village groups.Refreshments are   
 available to suit all tastes.A good   
 day is had by all and talked about for
 weeks after.                          </content>
