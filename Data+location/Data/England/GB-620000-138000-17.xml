		<content> In the morning we got everything      
 ready.                                
 Next we went to the church.When the   
 coach came we got on the back seat.We 
 went to Broadstairs.When we got there 
 we walked to the beach.After we had   
 unpacked,some of us went in the       
 sea.Later we went on the              
 swingboats.Then I bought a rubber with
 a tennis court on.We had a good       
 time.For tea we went to a hall. After 
 tea we played some games.Next we      
 walked back to the coach.When we were 
 all ready we got on. Then we went     
 home. On the way home it rained.
