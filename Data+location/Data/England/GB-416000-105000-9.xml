		<title>09Going to Church</title>
		<content>   My name is Nicola and I am a member 
 of{Poulner Baptist Chapel}Girl Jucos, 
 aged 10-12 years. We meet on a Sunday 
 between 11a.m. and 12 noon for a Bible
 Quiz, notices, a story and a lesson.  
 We have two leaders and a Minister    
 called Mr. Carroll.                   
   At the{Trinity Church,}Timothy and  
 Peter attend a service with hymns and 
 prayers mid-morning then go into a    
 small room for Sunday school where the
 teachers tell a story and give out    
 leaflets and pictures to colour in.   
   Vicky goes to the{Methodist Church} 
 where her father is Minister. Besides 
 a Sunday School there is a Junior Club
 on a Monday evening where the members 
 make things and play games. Methodist 
 Church members go on lots of outings  
 and have sponsored events. Once a year
 there is a family weekend visit to{   
{Swanage. }                            </content>
