		<title>12Werrington Police Station</title>
		<content>The Werrington Police Station caters   
for Werrington,Wetley Rocks,Cellarhead,
Hulme and parts of Bucknall.It was     
established in 1901,but a new station  
was built in 1952,with their first     
vehicle arriving in 1968.It is manned  
by 3 constables who are always on call,
24 hours a day.                        
      The population of Werrington is  
8400,which is double the number it was 
25 years ago.Cheadle Police Station is 
the main station in the Werrington     
area.Werrington is just off the        
A52,which also passes through Wetley   
Rocks and Cellarhead.                  
      Most calls are road accidents,   
which average 2 a week.Theft and       
burgalary are the crimes of greatest   
concern.Half of the emergency calls    
are not serious enough to warrant      
concern.                               
                                       </content>
