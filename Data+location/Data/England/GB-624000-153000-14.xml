		<content> The Parish of Holy Cross, Goodnestone.
 For the first time the Parish no      
 longer has a resident Priest and the  
 Parsonage has been sold.  The last    
 resident incumbent, Rev. Phillip      
 Pennant, cared for Goodnestone,       
 Chillenden with Knowlton and Adisham. 
 The Sheffield report, published some  
 years ago, deals with manning levels. 
 It's recommendations meant that the   
 Deanery of East Bridge needed to shed 
 two clergy, so Adisham joined another 
 Parish in 1984 on the retirement of   
 Rev. Pennant. The Rev. Ian Hawkins was
 offered the post for the benefice of  
 Nonington with Wymyms Wold and        
 Goodnestone with Chillenden and       
 Knowlton which came into being on 1st 
 November 1985.
