  His family home was Otley Hall and he
was described by Cpt John Smith as the 
prime mover of Jamestown, the first    
successful English settlement in       
America. In 1571 he went to Cambridge  
and then into law in London. The Earl  
of Southampton became his patron and   
financed his voyage to America in 1602.
He named Cape Cod on this voyage, and  
Martha's Vineyard after his daughter   
who had died, aged 2, just before his  
departure. Various expeditions of his  
were planned and discussed in Otley    
Hall.                                  
  After 4years of planning, 5 months of
perilous voyaging, Bartholomew was dead
within weeks of arrival, of a fever.   
And within a few years his family sank 
with the Royalist cause.
