<title>20Trowbridge Life 2011</title>
<content>Since the first article much has changed in Trowbridge many of the places of work talked about have gone such as bowyer and ushers, the job market in trowbridge now is once again hard many of the towns big employers have said there leaving the town such as Vodafone and Virgin both mobile communications companys.&lt;br />&lt;br />The main area to work now is in retail, since the first article we have had two new shopping centres open the shires and this year shires gateway both have large national chains such as argos,next, boots.&lt;br />&lt;br />Tesco is still a huge player in trowbridge moving from its first site in the town to a huge Tesco extra, we also have many other supermarkets including sainsburys that opend on the old ushers site.&lt;br />&lt;br />Trowbridge now also has a large out of town centre with names like currys,commet and now matalan.&lt;br />&lt;br />Trowbridge does however feel like a town on a downwards slop the town has no lesuire activites and the main town centre is full of empty shops, life in 21st century trowbridge has many of the same problems as life in the 80s.
