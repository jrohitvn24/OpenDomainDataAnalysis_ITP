		<title>19Coddenham Interesting Houses</title>
		<content> The buildings in Coddenham village are
 very varied and include some beautiful
 farmhouses on the outskirts. From     
 Pettaugh in the North a narrow street 
 of crowded houses and cottages mainly 
 of the 16-19th Century, runs into the 
 centre of the village and the grocers 
 shop. It was refronted in 1892 with a 
 brick facade, together with the old   
 Police House next door and adjoining  
 cottages; perhaps it was more         
 picturesque with bow windows and a    
 thatched roof. On the other side of   
 the road, what used to be the Crown   
 Inn, became two houses in 1963 with   
 new Geogian fronts. The building was  
 originally a dwelling built in oak by 
 a yeoman-farmer who it is said was    
 knighted at Agincourt. From the centre
 the High St winds uphill and on the   
 left is the first of a pair of large  
 15th century oak framed structures.   </content>
