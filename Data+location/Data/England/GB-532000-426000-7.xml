		<title>07THE LIGHTHOUSE,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  Withernsea's most dominant feature is
 its white-washed lighthouse,situated  
 not on the sea but at a road junction 
 about 300 yards inland.It is 135 ft   
 tall and stands in a 300 ft long plot 
 with a 3 bed-roomed house attached to 
 it.It was built in 1893 and was sited 
 inland largely to take account of the 
 erosion of the coast.It was closed    
 down in 1976 due to the advance of    
 modern technology which enables the   
 lighthouses to north and south at     
 Flamborough and Spurn Point to cover  
 the whole of the Holderness coast.    
  When operative the light shone 17    
 miles out to sea and there would be 3 
 flashes every minute.The bulb         
 structure floated on a bed of mercury 
 and it could be pushed with one       
 finger.The lighthouse has 147 steps to
 the top and although still owned by   
 Trinity House it is now up for sale.  </content>
