    Most people in the village are     
 healthy which is a good job because   
 there is just one surgery.There are   
 two doctors and a nurse in attendance 
 or on call.                           
    As the village population          
 increasingly consists of elderly and  
 retired people, the younger generation
 having moved out in search of         
 housing and or jobs, the demands made 
 upon the medical services also        
 increase.                             
   Any dental problems have to be      
 referred to practicioners in          
 Kidderminster. The school dentist's   
 mobile surgery does visit the school  
 regularly and it treats many of the   
 children.
