		<title>09POPULATION OF BICESTER.</title>
		<content>  At present the population of the town
is 17,500 and it is estimated to be    
26,000 by 1990.                        
  The town changed after the building  
of the Ordnance Depot in 1941 and many 
people were encouraged to come to the  
town in the sixties,by the offer of a  
civil service job and a house.People   
came particularly from the north and   
settled in the town,taking up the 800  
houses which belonged to the M.O.D.    
  There are many British Army personnel
living in the town.They are stationed  
at Ambrosden and work in the Ordnance  
Depot.                                 
  The U.S.A. Airforce base is at R.A.F.
Upper Heyford;a distance of 7 miles    
from Bicester.Many Americans live      
within quarters in the town and the    
R.A.F.quarters at Caversfield are at   
present leased to the Americans.
