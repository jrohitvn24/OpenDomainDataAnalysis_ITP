		<content> I am 13 years old,the eldest of two   
 sons.My parents are teachers.I get up 
 at 7:00am and get dressed.I do my     
 piano practice until 8:00am when I    
 have breakfast(bacon,egg,fried bread &amp;
 Cornflakes)which has been prepared by 
 Mum.I feed my pet guinea-pig and bunny
 at 8:30am.Then my friends arrive and I
 go off to school,on foot.I arrive at  
 school at 8:45am ready for assembly at
 8:50am.Between 8:50am and 3:50pm we   
 have 5 1-hour long lessons,a break,a  
 lunch-hour and 2 registrations.For    
 lunch I have chips and a'Coke'which   
 costs 40p.I walk home after school and
 at 6:00pm I have tea which is usually 
 a cooked meal.Afterwards I do several 
 different things,such as school home- 
 work,play cricket,football or tennis  
 or go to Youth Club.At 9:00pm,if I've 
 finished my homework,I wash and go to 
 bed.                                  </content>
