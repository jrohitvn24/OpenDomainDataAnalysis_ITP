		<title>07PICKFORD BUILDERS</title>
		<content> Fred Pickford came to Great Easton in 
 1914.He lived at the Bell with his    
 wife Eliza Alice.They had a few cows, 
 sheep and chickens.Fred had 5 sons and
 2 daughters called Jack,Frank,Tony,   
 Bert,David,Ruth and Mary.Fred started 
 "Fred Pickford Builder",in 1914. He   
 did not have many workers at first but
 as more people moved into the Village 
 he had to employ more workers.When his
 sons had left school they started     
 working for him.They worked from      
 5.00am-6.00pm and got 50p a week which
 was considered a lot in those days.   
 Later when Fred's three sons Frank,   
 Bert and Tony owned the company they  
 called it "Pickford and Sons".They    
 did nearly the same work as Fred      
 making tools and carts and restoring  
 old houses.Bert's son and nephews own 
 it now and it's called "Pickford      
 Builders".                            </content>
