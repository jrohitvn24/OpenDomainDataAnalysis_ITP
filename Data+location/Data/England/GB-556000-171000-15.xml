		<content>    Blue Circle wanted to dig a chalk  
 pit in Darenth Woods to make cement,  
 but Dartford Council and the active   
 resident groups didn't want them to.  
 Our school visits the woods a lot.  If
 they dig a quarry there, all the trees
 will be destroyed and flowers will not
 grow.  The wildlife will be ruined,   
 there will be no birds and no         
 squirrels.  The view would be horrid  
 and it would make a dreadful mess.  I 
 think we need cement for things like  
 buildings and the Thmes Barrier.  We  
 need it for bridges and roads.  Two   
 classes had a vote to see who wanted  
 Blue Circle to dig the holes.  Most   
 people didn't want them to do it.  We 
 think there are enough pits around    
 here even if another one would make   
 more jobs.
