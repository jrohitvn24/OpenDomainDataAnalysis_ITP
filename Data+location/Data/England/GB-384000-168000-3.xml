		<title>03THE VALLEY ESTATE, CORSHAM</title>
		<content>   This large estate has been built    
 over the last 10 years to the west of 
 old Corsham . We did a door           
 to door survey of the estate -in all  
 we interviewed 69 people . We learned 
 about where people lived before they  
 came to Corsham and where they work.  
   Here is a chart showing where people
 work.                                 
   Corsham = 8  Bath = 8  Hawthorn = 2 
   Retired = 7  MOD  = 6   Gastard = 1 
   Bristol = 3  Trowbridge = 1         
   Chipping Sodbury = 2  Unemployed = 1
   Chippenham = 5                      
                                       
   Therefore Corsham is a dormitory    
 town for the towns nearby.            
   From the survey 25 people have moved
 here in the last five years, only     
 4 people have lived in Corsham for    
 over 15 years. The average family size
 is four.                              </content>
