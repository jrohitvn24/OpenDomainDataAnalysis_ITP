 by churches of varying denominations.

 and{Methodists.}Although they have    
 their own way of worshipping they work
 very closely together to serve the    
 community. The{clergy}are kept busy   
 most days of the week visiting the    
 sick and house bound. Marriage and    
 funeral arrangements also have to be  
 made.The Christian community provide a
 centre for the unemployed,the lonely  
 and tramps,next to{St.Alkmunds Church 
 in the town centre.In Abbey Foregate  
 they also finance and run a social    
 centre for the local deaf people.Most 
 of the{congregation}appear to be      
 elderly people.At school out of 140   
 junior children only 20 attended      
 church regularly.Shrewsbury boasts    
 many beautiful churches but the{Abbey 
 is a must for any tourist to visit.   </content>
