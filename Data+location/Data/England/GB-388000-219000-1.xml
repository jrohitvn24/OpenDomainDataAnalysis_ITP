		<title>01UP HATHERLEY &amp; CHURCHDOWN</title>
		<content>  The area originally consisted of     
 three villages and their farmland.{Up 
{Hatherley}and{Churchdown}have grown   
 considerably to form dormitory suburbs
 for Cheltenham and Gloucester,        
{Badgeworth}has remained tiny,         
 undeveloped village.                  
{ Farming}is still very important,there
 being about six working farms,mostly  
 given over to grazing beef and dairy  
 cattle.Much land has been lost to     
{housing development}since 1960 and    
 plans are in hand for a great deal    
 more.                                 
{ Transport}is a dominent feature.The  
 M5 Motorway has a large interchange   
 with the A40 London to South Wales    
 road.This tends to cause many traffic 
 problems in the area.The railway line 
 from Birmingham to the South West is  
 parallel to the A40.There is also the 
 small regional airport at Staverton.  </content>
