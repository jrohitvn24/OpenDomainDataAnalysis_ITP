		<title>11THE BLACKWOOD AND THE BOGS.</title>
		<content> Hetton Houses Wood, also known as the 
 Black Wood has several varieties of   
 deciduous trees :  silver birch,      
 oak, ash, some sycamores, guelder rose
 and lots of hawthorn trees. We ate    
 some of the small green hawthorn      
 leaves which are nick-named bread and 
 cheese.  It is dark in the middle of  
 the wood, the ground is covered with  
 dead leaves, there are lots of        
 bluebells.                            
{Broomhill / The Bogs.}This is an  area
 of{wetland}to the west of Broomhill.  
 There is a slow-moving{stream}where   
 frogs and newts breed, marsh          
 marigolds, celandines, milk-maids, and
 water plankton are common. We saw many
 common horsetails and marsh           
 horsetails, which are poisonous to    
 cattle. Giant ones grew millions of   
 years ago here and are now part of the
 coal_seams.                           </content>
