		<title>14REED'S SCHOOL,COBHAM</title>
		<content> Reed's School was founded in 1813 for 
 boys with no fathers. Today a child   
 with no, or one, parent is still taken
 into special account. The school now  
 holds 340 boys aged between 11 and 18 
 and is divided into Junior and Senior 
 schools and then into other forms.    
 Some boys board and the rest go daily.
 The school has an imitation 17th      
 century main building. It also has    
 large sport facilities, and different 
 houses for boarders, staff and        
 classes. Reed's School covers 50 acres
 of woodland and heath.                
 The grounds are well kept and round   
 the main building there are modern    
 buildings and old sheds and stables   
 converted for school use, plus a      
 building under construction.
