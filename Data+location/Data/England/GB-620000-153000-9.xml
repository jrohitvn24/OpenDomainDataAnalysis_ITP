		<title>09Adisham  Transport and Use</title>
		<content>  Adisham's main transport is the      
private car. Younger families and      
wealthier older people run a car, some 
had two, and most wives drive. Cars are
used for commuting to work, shopping,  
and to go to entertainments, sport and 
holidays. Some also have caravans. Most
children have cycles and a few adults  
have a cycle or motorcycle. The unman- 
ned railway station is a quarter mile  
from the village. It is the main Dover,
Canterbury, London line and trains stop
every hour. Trains are used by numerous
people to get to and from schools and  
work also for shopping and recreational
visits. The bus service from Canterbury
to Goodnestone only runs on Wednesday  
and Saturday but goes into the village,
being mainly used by the elderly.      
Bossington has no bus service and the  
station is over a mile away.
