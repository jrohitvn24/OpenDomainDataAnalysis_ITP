		<content> Religion is:_ "something that involves
 worshipping God"                      
 :-"The belief in a spritual presence" 
 :-"I think religion has gradually     
 deteriorated over the years.The       
 principle of believing in God still   
 exists but it has gradually become    
 less and less important among people."
   "I don't associate God with religion
 because I think that God watches and  
 helps us,whereas religion consists of 
 stories and obeying things or people."
    The vicar at St.Catherine's Church 
 said that they have three services    
 every Sunday and there is a Sunday    
 School and a creche. There is one     
 service during the week and a Mothers 
 Union group and a Girls Friendly      
 Society. The parish is joined with    
 that of Aston Flamville which have one
 service a month.
