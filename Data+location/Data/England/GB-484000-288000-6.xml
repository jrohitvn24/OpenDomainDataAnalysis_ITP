		<title>06CORBY'S WOODS.</title>
		<content>    Once all Corby was inside the      
Rockingham Forest where Kings hunted.  
The bit of old woodland left still     
stands near the town centre behind the 
boating lake and across to Woodnewton  
Way.They are mostly oak trees,tall and 
fat. There are many pathways through   
them, from Woodnewton to Studfall,     
behind the Health Centre to Beanfield, 
and from the lake to the swimming      
baths.Many kids play there making dens 
and swings. The woods are not safe at  
night because of muggers and glue-     
sniffers. In the middle is a house with
guard dogs running free in the garden. 
When we explored we heard blackbird    
chicks squawking &amp; blackbirds singing. 
Early in the morning rabbits are eating
on a small patch of grass. A grey      
squirrel was there. We heard an owl.   
Parts are being cut down and cleared,  
so wildlife is now at risk.            </content>
