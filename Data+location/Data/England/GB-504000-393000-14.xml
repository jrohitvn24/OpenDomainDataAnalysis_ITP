		<title>14HOUSING - OWERSBY</title>
		<content> Of the 74 houses in this block 45 are 
 in the village of Nth.Owersby.Once an 
 estate village,the older houses are of
 local yellow brick,including what was 
 the village school.Alongside these the
 council owns 2 bungalows and 18 houses
 5 of which are being bought by their  
 occupants.Outside the village many of 
 the dwellings are farmhouses and their
 cottages.The district council policy  
 is for practically no growth in the   
 next few years,allowing infilling only
 within the village and elsewhere the  
 yardstick is genuine agricultural need
 only.Thus the only building this year 
 is a bungalow on an empty plot in the 
 main village street.3 properties have 
 been offered for sale-a modern farm-  
 house with farm buildings and 7 acres 
 of land at Â£76,000,a 3 bedroomed house
 in the village at Â£32,000 &amp; renovated 
 cottage on an outlying farm for Â£36000</content>
