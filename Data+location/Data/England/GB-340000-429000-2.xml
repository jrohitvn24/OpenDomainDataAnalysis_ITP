		<content>The Birley Arms                        
The Birley Arms Public House has not   
always been known by this name.The     
Birleys being mill owners in Kirkham   
spinning cotton and flax into linen.   
The Public House situated in a rural   
surroundings at the junction of Bryning
Lane,Hillock Lane and Carr Lane used to
be called "The Red Heart."It came by   
this name because of certain gruesome  
happenings during the civil war in 1642
. A battle was fought in the field     
behind the public house where musket   
balls have since been found.A soldier  
from Oliver Cromwell's army having     
killed a Royalist enemy,removed the    
heart from his body with his spear.He  
then proceeded to pin the heart above  
the door of the public house with the  
Royalist's own dagger.
