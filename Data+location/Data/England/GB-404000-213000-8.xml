		<title>08LOCAL MEMORIES  OF  YANWORTH</title>
		<content>     The oldest people can remember the
{six wells and the village pump }_  now
 in need of some minor repairs.  {Piped
{water}arrived about 1930 / 1933 and is
 a private estate supply.  {Toilets and
{bathrooms}were installed about 1953.  
    {Electricity }arrived October 1953.
     The powerful farm  machinery  kept
 in  the  village ensures the roads are
 seldom  blocked  by{ snow} but one man
 recalls  helping  with the team of six
 horses that pulled a  wooden plough in
 the early years of the century.       
     Until 1982 Yanworth was famous for
 its{opera production.  }About 45 local
 young  people  camped in  the  village
 while practising for the  Saturday and
 Sunday night productions of  West Side
 Story, Oklahoma etc. in the big barn. 
     The {allotments }_  once the pride
 and joy of the village  _  reflect the
 changing leisure time interests.      </content>
