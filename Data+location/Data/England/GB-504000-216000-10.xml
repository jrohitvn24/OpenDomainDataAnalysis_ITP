		<content>           {TATES COACHES              
  Markyate has its own firm of coach   
 operators. They are called Tates      
 Coaches and were started in 1947 by   
 William Tate. He decided he had enough
 money to buy an old coach instead of  
 driving a lorry.He started off at the 
 side of the filling station which is  
 now Jacobs Biscuit Warehouse. Then,   
 when the old gasworks closed down,    
 they managed to get half of it and    
 shared it with Mr.Burgess who owned   
 some lorries.In 1979 they needed a    
 bigger garage and more room for their 
 coaches, so they bought B&amp;B Coach     
 Services at Potten End.On average     
 eight coaches are used every day.They 
 employ eight full-time drivers and    
 several part-timers who work mainly at
 weekends. Altogether they have got    
 nine coaches and two buses.
