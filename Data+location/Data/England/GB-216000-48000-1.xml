		<title>01The coast of Lansallos.</title>
		<content>      The coastal land of Lansallos is 
 divided into two distinct types       
 -farmland &amp; cliffs. The cliffs are    
 owned by the National Trust and most  
 of the farmland is as well.It is very 
 popular with tourists, but it is      
 relatively unspoilt as area can only  
 be reached on foot. The very rocky    
 waterline along the coast is not      
 approachable by boat and the only safe
 havens are Polperro to the East and   
 the beach at Lansallos, where the     
 solid rock has been cut through to    
 obtain access from the shore to the   
 track that leads to the village.
