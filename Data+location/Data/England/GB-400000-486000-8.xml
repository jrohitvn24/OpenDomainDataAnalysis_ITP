		<title>08FAMILY LIFE, THORALBY</title>
		<content> Jane's family consumes large amounts  
 of fruit. She likes to cook fresh     
 foods and bakes her own bread; she    
 believes in a healthy diet with lots  
 of wholefoods and fresh ingredients.  
 She thought of the advantages and     
 disadvantages of living in the        
 country. Two disadvantages are that   
 all her children suffer from hayfever 
 in summer, and there are fewer shops  
 here. Jane is very happy living in the
 Dales and thinks it is a good area in 
 which to bring up children: they see  
 the cycle of life and death in nature 
 and in people.  Some advantages are   
 that life feels more secure, and it is
 more peaceful than in towns.  If she  
 didn't live in the Dales, Jane said   
 she would like to live in France or   
 Northumbria.
