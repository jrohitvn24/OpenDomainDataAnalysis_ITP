{year old boy.                         
 I woke up it was Wednesday morning and
 7a.m. Fifteen minutes later I got up  
 and had a wash and put on my school   
 uniform. I went to the kitchen and had
 my breakfast and off to school. I     
 arrived at school put my sandwiches in
 the kitchen then off to the classroom 
 to do some Maths. Later I went into   
 the hall to help four other boys      
 prepare for Assembly. We were         
 responsible for the religious service 
 that day. When we went back to the    
 classroom it was time for Calculator  
 Maths. Playtime. Afterwards English   
 work until the dinner bell rang. We   
 had our sandwiches and played this    
 time it was Football. Rounders against
 Moreton Morrell was cancelled, so it  
 was Cycling Proficiency. Home to watch
 telelvision and bed.                  </content>
