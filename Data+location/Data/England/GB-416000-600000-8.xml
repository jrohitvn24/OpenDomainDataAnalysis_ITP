		<title>08The Recreation Field.</title>
		<content> The recreation field just North of the
 river is 7.6 acres and is maintained  
 by Felton Parish Council who bought   
 the land from the local squire who    
 lived in Felton Park. Money was raised
 locally 6 years ago to provide 2 sets 
 of swings,a climbing frame,a see-saw  
 and some goal posts.The"Felton Frolic"
 was held in 1981 to raise money for   
 goal posts. There were all kinds of   
 stalls,pony rides,a fancy dress foot- 
 ball match and sports. The money is   
 still in the bank but everyone had a  
 very good day.
