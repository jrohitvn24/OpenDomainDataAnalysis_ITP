		<title>20ENTERTAINMENT, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Entertainment in Rugeley is varied and
 mainly home-made. Most youth clubs    
 have been amalgamated into the Youth  
 Centre which runs many activities. The
 Eaton Lodge Hotel runs discos and     
 dances. Scout and Guide groups are    
 thriving. A local operatic society has
 one production per year; other live   
 theatre is found in neighbouring      
 towns. There is a strong local history
 society and other special interest    
 groups. There is no professional sport
 in Rugeley but there are clubs for all
 the main sports - football, cricket,  
 hockey, rugby, cycling, snooker. The  
 nearest public swimming pool is at    
 Cannock but the small pool at Hagley  
 school is open to the public for a    
 limited time. All 3 school pools are  
 used by clubs.
