		<title>11Playing in the woods</title>
		<content>      Sometimes Rebecca and Samantha   
 come to stay with their grandma and   
 grandad. We have quite a{quiet wood   
 and we have a{nun's house}at the      
 back. Last month we made a camp out of
 wood, fern, gates, wheels and seats   
 then we camouflaged it. We go in it   
 quite a lot.                          
      The people who lived in our house
 before had a swing and we have it now.
 Alice Murphy, who lives next door, has
 the wood as well. But James and Andrew
 have a smaller garden so they have no 
 wood but we play in the wood a lot. I 
 like playing in the woods. Our garden 
 is 300 feet long to the woods. We go  
 and see the nun's and take them       
 flowers in the summer. It is an       
{old peoples home}as well and we take  
{flowers}to them in the{summer.        
      They have their{own church.
