		<title>16Farming - Cropping</title>
		<content> There are 10 farms in the area,       
 varying from 100 to 1000 acres, all   
 within ring fences. All are livestock 
 rearing, with varying amounts of      
 cropping. The arable area would be    
 larger were it not for heavy slow     
 draining clay, particularly on lower  
 lying areas (hence brickworks).       
 Land is almost all tile drained, with 
 as much as 25% completed within the   
 preceding 20 yrs (agricultural grants 
 and postwar agricultural boom). This  
 has allowed some expansion of arable  
 area and intensification of stocking  
 rates. Barley is the main crop grown  
 largely for home use but wheat has    
 increased in importance and oats are  
 still grown on 2 farms. The once      
 universal swede has now disappeared   
 from half the farms as silage making  
 has spread and only 2 farms still rely
 on hay.                               </content>
