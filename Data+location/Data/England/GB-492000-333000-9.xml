		<title>09Grantham:Old Barracks</title>
		<content> In Sandon Rd opposite the Kesteven and
 Grantham Girls' School there are some 
 old barracks. Today the barracks are  
 used mainly by the Grantham College of
 Further Education for teaching        
 building and decorating skills.In 1985
 Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School   
 use several rooms for Computer Studies
 and the drill hall for Physical       
 Education until their new buildings   
 are completed in 1986.The old living  
 quarters are owned by Lincolnshire    
 County Council and are at present     
 rented to employees of the Council.   
 The barracks were built in the 1850s  
 for the Royal South Lincolnshire      
 Militia and the drill hall was used as
 a military hospital in the First World
 War.In 1985 the old rifle racks are   
 still in position by the original     
 guard room                            
                                       </content>
