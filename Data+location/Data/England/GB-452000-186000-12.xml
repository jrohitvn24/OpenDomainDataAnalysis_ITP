		<title>12East Hagbourne- Ghosts</title>
		<content>Some people still believe that ghosts  
may be seen in East Hagbourne, on New  
Years Eve. Indeed it has been claimed  
that a headless horseman has been seen 
on at least two separate occasions     
riding through the village. No one     
seems very sure how the story started. 
Some say that it dates from the time   
Cromwell quartered 6000 horsemen here  
in 1644 but some say it comes from the 
grave, opened in 1803, of a British    
chief buried in 55 BC with his horses  
and chariot.                           
If you run round the King's Carpenters 
grave 4 times at midnight, you will see
ghosts holding hands and dancing round 
the church! The carpenter in question  
was Thomass Phillips, carpenter to     
Kings George I &amp; II, who died 14th     
August 1736 at the age of 47. His son, 
who died on 14th May 1736, age 6, is   
buried with him.                       </content>
