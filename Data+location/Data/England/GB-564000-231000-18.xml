		<content> In a rural community like this thesize
 and pattern of the population is such 
 that there are no schools in the      
 survey area.Even at the primary level 
 children must go to school in the     
 villages like Great Sampford or Great 
 Bardfield.More senior children go     
 further afield as far as Saffron      
 Walden or even Newport.This is true   
 whether they attend local authority   
 schools or fee-paying schools.There is
 a school bus service that is operated 
 from Finchingfield;alternatively      
 parents provide transport for their   
 own and friends' children.Naturally,  
 young people who continue with higher 
 education at college or university    
 must also travel or live away from    
 home.The village schools provide a    
 valuable social link between families 
 who generally do not live in close    
 proximity.                            </content>
