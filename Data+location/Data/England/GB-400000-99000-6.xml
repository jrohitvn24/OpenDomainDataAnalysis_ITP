		<title>06Old Memories of Wimborne.</title>
		<content> I spoke to an old lady who has lived  
 in Wimborne all her life.  She told me
 that when she was a little girl there 
 were only gas street lights in        
 Wimborne and a man came around to     
 light them.  On Tuesdays it was market
 day and cattle used to go past her on 
 her way to school.  There was one     
 blacksmith in Wimborne and he was in  
 King Street.  On Saturday evenings the
 shops used to stay open until 9 p.m.  
 and Wimborne was very busy. Outside   
 the Albion a lady called Cockle Kate  
 sold sea food which she sold from a   
 barrow.  The Salvation Army always    
 played in the Square on Saturday      
 evenings.  Petrol was l/4d. a gallon  
 and electricity was ld. in the        
 meter.In the war there were four bombs
 dropped in Colehill.
