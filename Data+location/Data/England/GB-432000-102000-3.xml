		<title>03New Forest-Trains, Dyke</title>
		<content> Running through the centre of this    
 area is the main London to Bournemouth
 railway line with trains coming along 
 approximately every two minutes. This 
 offers the opportunity for those      
 people who are interested in train    
 spotting. There is a level crossing   
 for the visitor to reach the          
 inclosures to the north. It is not    
 possible for deer and ponies to cross 
 this way. The former railway cottages 
 here are now privately owned.         
 For those people who are interested in
 historical sites there are, in the    
 north-east of this area, some{tumuli. 
 These are surrounded by{Bishop's Dyke.
 This is an earthen bank which is      
 clearly visible in places and which   
 encloses a large area of marsh,       
 moorland and some trees. This was     
 given to the Bishop of Winchester in  
 1284 in the reign of King Edward I.   </content>
