		<content> The area is exposed and thus windy,   
 but is saved from excessive cold by   
 the moderating effect of the Trent    
 Valley. Its climate is closest to that
 of the SE of England but somewhat     
 colder because of latitude and height.
 The average annual rainfall is 625 mm,
 and annual sunshine about 1350 hours. 
 The growing season extends from early 
 April to late November. There is some 
 risk of drought during dry summers.   
 1985 has, however, been cooler and    
 less sunny than average so there was  
 no shortage of moisture in the soil   
 until the autumn, when the dry Sep-   
 tember caused the farmers to complain 
 that they could not get on with sowing
 winter wheat, the heavy clay soil     
 having become baked.
