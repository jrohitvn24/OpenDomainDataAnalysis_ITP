		<title>16FLETCHWOOD MEADOWS</title>
		<content> Fletchwood Meadows is a nature reserve
 owned by the Hampshire and I.O.W.     
 Naturalists Trust. It is 5.5 hectares 
 in extent and was bought in November  
 1984 for Â£3O,OOO. There are four      
 meadows within the site which lies    
 between Bartley Water and the main    
 London to Bournemouth railway line.   
 The soils vary in wetness between the 
 meadows and seventeen species of      
 plants typical of ancient and         
 unimproved meadows are present on the 
 site. The idea behind the nature      
 reserve is to retain farming in the   
 traditional manner without use of     
 chemicals, and to prevent ploughing   
 which would most likely happen        
 otherwise on these sandy loams. There 
 are a large number of anthills present
 which leads to a greater variety of   
 species of plants. Access is allowable
 by permit.                            </content>
