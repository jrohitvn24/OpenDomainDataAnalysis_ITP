		<content>      Our Spring flower show is the    
 first event of the year. Depending on 
 the severity of the Winter frosts and 
 the date of Easter the show is held in
 March or April. During the preceding  
 months the committee has organised the
 various flower classes, the cookery   
 and the children's section. The       
 brochures have been printed and handed
 out to families in Ripe and the       
 surrounding villages. When the day    
 arrives the entries are taken to the  
 village hall where they are put on    
 display. Then the judges come and sort
 out the winners. Then a quick         
 snack lunch is eaten and we all troup 
 back to the hall to see what we have  
 won. Prize money is collected and     
 spent again on the teas and sideshows.
      After the silver cups have been  
 given to the winners we collect our   
 entries and return home.              </content>
