		<title>14MEDIA IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> Radios and television are common,     
 with many houses having more than     
 one, but due to the position of       
 Chitterne in a fold of the Downs,     
 television reception is poor on some  
 channels.  The national daily         
 newspapers are received in the village
 early in the day, coming by train to  
 Salisbury and thence to Chitterne by  
 road.  Two locally employed youngsters
 then deliver them to the houses, for  
 which they are paid Â£3 a week.  There 
 are two locally produced free         
 journals;  the fortnightly "Wylye     
 Valley Life", concentrating on such   
 items as poetry, local history,       
 gardening, advertisements, meetings,  
 etc., for which delivery boys are paid
 1p. a copy, and a monthly single sheet
 newsletter of Chitterne, detailing    
 items of village interest and news.
