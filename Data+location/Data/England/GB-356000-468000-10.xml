		<title>10Contact Magazine</title>
		<content>The Hornby area is fortunate to have   
its own magazine to inform the         
inhabitants of current affairs within  
the area. About 14 years ago Mr. Bob   
Beetham thought it would be a good idea
to supply every house with information 
concerning forthcoming events so that  
it would avoid more than one event     
being held on the same day. Today the  
magazine includes not only information 
for one's diary, but also "lost and    
found", "for sale and wanted" adverts.,
reports of events which have recently  
been held and a separate pull-out      
section which contains all the church  
news and reports.                      
Two ladies in the village are          
responsible for compiling the monthly  
editions which take a day to type and  
duplicate. 430 copies are printed All  
but 24 are delivered to homes; these   
are sold at the Post Office, price 5p. </content>
