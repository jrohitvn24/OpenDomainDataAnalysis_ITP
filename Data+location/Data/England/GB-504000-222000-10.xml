		<content> This is a{Centre for handicapped      
 people both young and old. The        
 building is 8 years old and there are 
 normally 35 residents.When we visited 
 there were only 28.We went to see a   
 nice lady called Vera,who has lived   
 there for 8 years.She likes it a lot  
 because you can do what you want,and  
 you can pick your own room.Vera does  
 her own shopping in the Arndale Centre
 and gets there by taxi.On Sundays she 
 goes to St.Lukes Church and meets her 
 friends there.During the week she does
 her needlework,plays dominoes,watches 
 T.V,and also plays billiards.There is 
 a little cafe where she can buy a meal
 but she can also be private and quiet 
 in her own room.She likes Jack Lord   
 and has a picture of him.Although pets
 are allowed,Vera has not got one,but  
 she would like to have a cat and a    
 dog.She seems to be very happy here.  </content>
