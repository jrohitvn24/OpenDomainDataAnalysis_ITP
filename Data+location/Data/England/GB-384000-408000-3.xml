		<content> One interesting feature of Heywood is 
 the large number of {Public Houses.}In
 our reference block alone, there are  
 45 public houses and hotels. At one   
 time, the town had its own {Brewery,} 
 the Phoenix Brewery. Although the firm
 was taken over and the brewery closed,
 the building can still be seen and    
 even bears the old name. The oldest   
 pubs are to be found along the main   
 road and especially in the centre     
 near  St. Lukes. The most famous of   
 these is the Queen Anne, but it was   
 closely connected with the Freemasons 
 Arms across the road. Several renewals
 have taken place , each one           
 accompanied by stories of subterranean
 passages and old cellars used as a    
 prison. Nowadays, the newer type of   
 public house, with a disco, is        
 represented by the Victoria, but the  
 older style still remains.            </content>
