		<title>15Val de la Mare Reservoir</title>
		<content>   The post 1945{increase in           
{population, tourism and general       
{prosperity}soon created pressure on   
 the island's water supplies.  The Val 
 de la Mare Reservoir was built in the 
 early 1960s to hold some 200 million  
 gallons of water.                     
                                       
   This did not prove enough and in the
 later 1960s a{desalination plant}was  
 built on the SW corner of the island. 
 The water from this distillation plant
 is pumped from the SW across the block
 and into Val de la Mare reservoir so  
 as to make it more palatable.         
                                       
   The dam has suffered from{"concrete 
{disease",}a type of alkali reaction   
 which has been largely coped with at  
 present.  There are many who would    
 wish to raise the present dam to      
 create much greater storage.          </content>
