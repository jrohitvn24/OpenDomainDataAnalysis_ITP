		<title>07Middlezoy Parish Church</title>
		<content> There has been some sort of church in 
 Middlezoy since 971, but the present  
 church was not built until about 1268 
 and there have been a number of       
 additions since.  The Dedication of   
 the church is to the Holy Cross.      
 The tower is a fine example of an     
 early 15th Century Somerset tower.    
 Just below the battlements 'Hunky     
 Punks' can be seen.  These are small  
 carved figures (distinct from         
 gargoyles which hold water spouts) and
 are only found in a small area of     
 south and west Somerset.              
 Middlezoy Parish Church is now part of
 a United Benefice with four other     
 parishes and so shares a vicar with   
 those parishes. In 1985 Canon John    
 Tinsley retired and will be succeeded 
 by Rev Martin George.
