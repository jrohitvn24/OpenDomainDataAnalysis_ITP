		<content> In Creswell, the Model Village was    
 built by the Bolsover Colliery Company
 in 1897 to provide accommodation for  
 its employees. The houses were built  
 in an octagon around a large central  
 green which provides a pleasant area  
 for recreation. All of the houses are 
 within a few hundred metres of the    
 colliery itself.                      
 Welbeck Street and Duke Street consist
 mainly of terraced houses built after 
 the turn of the century.              
 More recently still an area of        
 semi-detached Council housing was     
 built, with some bungalows especially 
 for old age pensioners.               
 There are also smaller areas of       
 detached and semi-detached private    
 houses.
