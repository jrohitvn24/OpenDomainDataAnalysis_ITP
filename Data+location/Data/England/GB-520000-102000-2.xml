		<title>02Flooding on Shoreham Beach</title>
		<content> We asked several residents on Shoreham
 Beach if they liked living there to   
 which the unanimous reply was 'yes'.  
    The next question was  'What are   
 the advantages/disadvantages of living
 by the sea'.Some of the replies  were 
 'it's a clean environment','quiet','it
 has the advantages of being on a      
 desert island with none of the        
 inconvenience','it's wild             
 here-untamed'.The disadvantages were  
 'bad winters','hard to grow           
 plants','you have to paint the house  
 every 2 years','it's often quite      
 windy.'                               
    Then we asked if they thought that 
 the houses were too near the sea.The  
 general attitude was that they weren't
 but some people thought differently   
    Next came 'Have you ever been      
 flooded before?' Only 1 person said   
 'yes-3 times.'                        </content>
