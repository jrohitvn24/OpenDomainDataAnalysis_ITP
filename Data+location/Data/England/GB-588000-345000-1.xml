		<title>01North Norfolk Coast at Wells</title>
		<content> A Sanddune ridge thirty feet high,    
 covered with spacious pinewoods       
 forming a nature conservancy council  
 reserve always open to the public and 
 called Holkham Meals, runs east-west. 
 It has a coastguard lookout and       
 lifeboat station at its eastern end.  
 North is the beach with miles of      
 sandflats at low tide.   South lies   
 ditch-drained aragle farmland, parking
 for 500 cars, and a caravan park      
 accommodating 4000 holidaymakers in   
 summer, and geese, gulls and waders in
 winter.   An office and five shops    
 operate at the caravan park in summer 
 employing twenty people.   The only   
 full-time jobs in winter are Nature   
 Reserve Warden, Coastguard, and       
 Caravan Park Manager.  About 24 times 
 a month a pilot steers a 400 ton ship 
 through the sandbanks into Wells.     
 Birdwatching is popular with Twitchers</content>
