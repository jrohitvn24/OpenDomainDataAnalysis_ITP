		<content>Outside school we play kickstone lurky,
hoola-hoop,skipping,kite-flying,footbal
bike-riding and catch the ball. If it  
is dry we play in Lamb's field. There  
are cow pats all over! So it is better 
to be careful.In the village we have a 
tiny play area with stepping stones and
swings and climbing frames.            
On dark nights we play inside with     
other children. We play with "My little
ponies".Computers are a big favourite  
with most children in the village.I    
think that most children still like to 
play games and have fun together. We   
don't play board games as much as      
people used to do.I think that is      
because when we are having  quiet times
we watch television or play with our   
computers.Monopoly is a popular board  
game- most children have one.Perhaps   
T/V may not be so popular this winter!
