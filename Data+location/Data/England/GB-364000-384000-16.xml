		<content> The farms have not always been at the 
 top of Highfield Road because a farmer
 who worked the fields before let them 
 get messed up so he had to close down 
 and the farm house was pulled down.   
 This now a ridding school.  Other     
 farms have been built recently.  The  
 hairdressers on the main road used to 
 be a grocers shop.                    
 She also said that the Health Club    
 used to be a cinema.  But then it     
 became a "Potato Peeling Factory".    
 Lots fo women worked there peeling    
 potatoes for the local fish and chip  
 shops.  It then became a timber       
 stroage building before opening as a  
 Health Club in l984.
