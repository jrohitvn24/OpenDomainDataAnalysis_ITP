 On Fridays we meet at Burbage Parish  
 Church at 7.00 p.m. when we practice  
 our songs for the Church services on  
 the following Sunday.                 
  On Sunday morning the first service  
 is Holy Communion then later we attend
 Matins where the choir sings Psalms   
 out of a Psalter as well the Hymns out
 the Hymn book. In the evening three is
 another service where we sing.        
  On Saturday's there is sometimes a   
 Wedding when also go and sing.        
  We also meet on a Monday at 6.30p.m. 
 but this time we just play games we   
 then have a drink and biscuit.It is   
 called Choir club.
