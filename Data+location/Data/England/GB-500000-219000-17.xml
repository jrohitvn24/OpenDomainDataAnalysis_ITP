		<content> Downs House Riding Stables are well   
 known in the Dunstable area. It has   
 been in operation for 14 years and    
 Mrs. Dyke, the owner, says they will  
 still be in business in many years to 
 come.                                 
   During the week 14 people are       
 employed to attend to the ten acres of
 land 26 ponnies owned by the stables  
 and those privately owned. These have 
 to be fed watered and mucked every    
 day.                                  
   The busiest day of the week is      
 Saturday when lots of people          
 come to the stables to ride but this  
 number drops in winter.
