		<content>   Much of the farmland around the     
 villages of Barnston, Little Dunmow   
 and Felsted is used for crops, mostly 
 barley, wheat and oilseed rape.  In   
 order to use modern mechanised        
 methods, hedges have been removed to  
 make larger fields. To cut down       
 expense many of the large pieces of   
 equipment are shared between farmers. 
                                       
   Some of the farms are privatly owned
 but others are rented from Essex      
 County Council.  This originates from 
 the end of the first World War when a 
 statue was decreed by Parliament that 
 County Councils were required to make 
 a number of farms available for       
 ex-servicemen to rent. Many Councils  
 are now selling these farms, but Essex
 is one of the exceptions and remains  
 one of the largest landowners.
