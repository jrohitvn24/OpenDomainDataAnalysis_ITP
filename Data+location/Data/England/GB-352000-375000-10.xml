		<title>10NEWTON HALL</title>
		<content> The impressive Hall and grounds were  
 donated to the National Children's    
 Home in 1900, opened as an orphanage  
 in 1903 and by the 1920s there were   
 300 children in residence. Five houses
 and a chapel, an important centre     
 of Methodist upbringing are situated  
 around a circular lawn which has been 
 used for many sporting and gala       
 occasions. Boys were segragated to    
 houses on one side of the circle, only
 meeting the girls on Sunday afternoons
 'In the circle'. Many social events   
 took place 'On the Branch' as the Hall
 was known, brownies and guides, hand  
 bell ringing, a choir and inter house 
 sports. In 1970, dividing the houses  
 into flats created a family atmosphere
 Numbers admitted to the home gradually
 decreased, adoption becoming more     
 popular. The home closes this year. 80
 years of caring has come to an end.   </content>
