 Forestry has been carried out on the  
 Goodwood Estate for over 200 years.   
 Many of the beech trees were planted  
 in the time of the 3rd or 4th Dukes of
 Richmond.  The total area of the      
 forest is approximately 2.220         
 hectares.Most of the Estate woodland  
 is productive, that means conifers or 
 hardwoods for selling and some is     
 unproductive, growing thorn, scrub,   
 poor quality ash, oak and beech. The  
 soil is thin rendzina over chalk and  
 some low lying clay with gravel.      
                                       
 There is one head woodman and five    
 woodmen. The felling and replanting   
 now covers 4 hectares each year and   
 2,000 cubic metres of timber is       
 produced.
