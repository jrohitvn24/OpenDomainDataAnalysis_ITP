		<title>03SHOEWORKER IN HIGHAM FERRERS</title>
		<content>Gordon gets up at 7am. At 7:30am he    
goes to work in the Leather Room. It   
is quiet in there unlike the Clicking  
Room. It smells but not as bad as the  
Closing Room. It smells of glue in     
there and it is not ventilated. Some   
people ask to leave to get fresh air.  
Gordon's glad he does not work there.  
                                       
He works 5 days a week, Monday to      
Friday from 8am to 5pm. He gets 2      
breaks a day for 10 minutes.  During   
that time he can use the food and      
drinks vending machines. He gets 1 hour
for dinner in which he goes home. Bob  
brings a packed lunch as there is not a
cafe.                                  
                                       
Gordon likes the shoes, they are not   
too fashionable but they are a smart   
shoe.
