		<title>01N.W.Chard &amp; Its Villages</title>
		<content> Apart from the buildings along{Combe  
{Street}and{High Street}this part of   
{Chard}was built mainly after WW2.     
 In area it is approx 1/6 of the town. 
{Wadeford and Chardleigh Green}to the  
 N.have become something of dormitory  
 villages in contrast to{Whitestaunton}
 to the W.where there is little other  
 than farming development.             
 The block lies on the S.end of the    
{Blackdown Hills}and is dominated by   
{Snowdon Hill,219m.}The town itself is 
 said to be the highest in{Somerset}   
 with the main part above 110m.        
 Although referred to as{Chard}in the  
 text,9/10 of the block is open country
 devoted mainly to{dairy farming. }    
 There is a small{tourist}trade but    
 Chard,which celebrated its 750 years  
 as a Borough in 1985,is generally     
 known only as a place that holiday    
 makers pass through on their way West.</content>
