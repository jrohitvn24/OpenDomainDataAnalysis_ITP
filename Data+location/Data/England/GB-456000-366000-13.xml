		<content>  I get up in the morning,get dressed  
 and have my breakfast.Sometimes I play
 games on my computer.I go upstairs and
 get ready for school.I put my school  
 things in a bag and call for my       
 friends,Rebecca and Suzanne.          
  We arrive at school at about 8.45a.m.
 School is from 9a.m.to 3.15p.m.with a 
 15mins.break at 10.30a.m.and a 10mins.
 break at 2.20p.m.Dinner break is from 
 12.3Op.m. to 1.15p.m.                 
  After school I walk home, have some  
 tea and then play outside when the    
 weather is fine.                      
  I come in at about 8.OOp.m. and watch
 television. About 9.OOp.m. I go       
 upstairs and get ready for bed. Mum   
 usually lets me read for 1O minutes   
 and then I turn out the light and I go
 to sleep.
