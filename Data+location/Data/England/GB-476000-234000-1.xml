		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO NASH AREA</title>
		<content> This area typifies the open rolling   
 countryside of N.Bucks. It combines a 
 mixture of picturesque villages and   
 open farmland which, despite the      
 proximity of Milton Keynes retains its
 rural character.                      
 The block takes in most of the Parish 
 of Beachampton and of Nash and to the 
 west, part of Thornton. The 2 villages
 of Nash and Beachampton show a        
 pleasant combination of old and new   
 dwellings, whose inhabitants mainly   
 have to travel outside the area for   
 work, education, health and other     
 services.  Car ownership is a         
 necessity as public transport is      
 almost non-existent. The 2 settlements
 have remained genuine village         
 communities with old established      
 families living alongside newcomers   
 attracted to the area by Milton Keynes
 with all its amenities.               </content>
