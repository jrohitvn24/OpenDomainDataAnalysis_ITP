		<title>13SPORTS FACILITIES.</title>
		<content> Recreation facilities are well        
 provided for with a 9 hole golf course
 which incidentally is situated on     
 either side of the main road through  
 the area.  Plus a cricket club, tennis
 club and football field (belonging to 
 Marsden Football Club whose main site 
 is in the town).  All these clubs are 
 open to visitors.  Originally these   
 facilities were provided by the major 
 woollen mill owner, Crowthers for the 
 use of the people of Marsden.  There  
 is also a children's recreation park. 
 So everyone is catered for.
