 to talk about something important.They
 also have Mother's Union and Young    
 Farmers meetings once a month.        
   The ladies of Chevithorne go to the 
 Youth Centre in Tiverton to Crochet   
 Club.They sometimes have entertainment
 in the evening at the Village Hall.   
 This might be Bingo or a get-together.
 Sometimes Coffee Mornings are         
 arranged.

 and garden in their spare time. They  
 also go for walks.
