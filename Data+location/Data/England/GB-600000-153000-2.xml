 Tourism is a growth industry promoted 
 locally by the South East Tourist     
 Board. There is no major tourist      
 attraction in the area apart from     
 local churches but many tourists use  
 it as a base to visit Canterbury,     
 Faversham, Leeds Castle, Chilham and  
 even London taking advantage of bed   
 and breakfast type accommodation      
 offered by pubs and private houses at 
 an average cost of Â£7 - Â£1O per       
 person, per night.  About 7O% of      
 tourists are from The Netherlands,    
 arriving at Sheerness via Vlissingen  
 on the Olau Ferry Line.  Another lO%  
 are Americans (often trying to trace  
 their ancestry) and the remainder are 
 mostly British and other Europeans who
 are just passing through on the way to
 or from Dover.
