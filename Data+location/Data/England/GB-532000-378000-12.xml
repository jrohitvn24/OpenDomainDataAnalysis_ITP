		<content>       The block lies in an area of    
 great natural beauty and is close to  
 many places of interest.              
     It is on the edge of 'Tennyson    
 Country' with his home at Somersby    
 Rectory lying nearby.  Harrington     
 Hall, the presumed setting for "Maud" 
 is about 10km. away.  It is an        
 impressive house with pleasant gardens
 and a garden-centre.  Both house and  
 gardens are often open to the public. 
     The East Coast resorts of         
 Mablethorpe and Skegness are nearby,  
 and there are many interesting small  
 villages and churches within easy     
 reach.                                
     There are many pleasant and varied
 walks in and around the block.        
     The only accomodation in the block
 is a youth hostel.                    
     Being an agricultural area,       
 tourism is not actively encouraged.   </content>
