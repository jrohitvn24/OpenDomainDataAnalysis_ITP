		<content> The Blackbirds' Farm Sewage Works were
 opened on July 20th 1973.  It is run  
 by The Thames Valley Water Authority  
 and deals with all the sewage for     
{RADLETT, ST ALBANS, HATFIELD, ELSTREE}
 and {POTTERS BAR.} The daily intake of
 sewage is 27,000 to 30,000 cubic      
 metres.  There are 3 massive treatment
 pans; a central Control Room of a     
 modern design and this is staff       
 operated.                             
 All the treated sewage is returned to 
 The River Colne as clean water.       
 The River Colne lies half a mile to   
 the West and North of the site.       
 The choice of site was carefully      
 selected and it lies at the bottom of 
 a dry valley, well out of view and is 
 not in fact seen until you are nearly 
 on top of it.
