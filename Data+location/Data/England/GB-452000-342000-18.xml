		<title>18RELIGION IN WEST NOTTINGHAM</title>
		<content> There are eighteen{Churches}in our    
 particular area. Of these, eight are {
{Non-conformist,}eight are{Church of   
{England}of which one is attached to a 
 cemetary, of the other two, one is    
 also attached to a cemetary, and one  
 to a Hospital. There are no Roman     
 Catholic{Churches}and no non-Christian
 places of worship in the area.        
 The age of the buildings range from   
 mid nineteenth century to early       
 twentieth century, however one church 
 St. Leodagarius dates back to the     
 twelfth century and contains traces of
 a thirteenth century church and       
 fourteenth century work. The present  
 building, however, dates f4om         
 l858-l861 when the church was restored
 and re-built.                         
 Today churches are often closed during
 the day as a result of the ever       
 present threat of vandalism and theft.</content>
