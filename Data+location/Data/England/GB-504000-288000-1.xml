		<title>01OUNDLE BLOCK - SUMMARY</title>
		<content>   In the block there are four villages
 and one town. The town is Oundle and  
 the villages are Ashton, Tansor,      
 Warmington and Cotterstock. The River 
 Nene which flows to the Wash is a     
 meandering river passing south of     
 Oundle. This is not a heavily         
 populated area. Most people live in   
 Oundle and the villages and work      
 locally although some commute to      
 London.The main land-cover is arable  
 with grazing land close behind. What  
 little industry there is here results 
 from agriculture. The major land-owner
 is the Ashton Estate. The other       
 institution of note in the block is   
 Oundle School which provides work and 
 swells the population by approximately
 a thousand in term-time. The major    
 activity of 1985 is the building of   
 the by-pass along the old railway     
 line.                                 </content>
