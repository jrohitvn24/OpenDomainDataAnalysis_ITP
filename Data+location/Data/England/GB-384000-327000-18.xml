		<title>18ECCLESHALL FRUIT FARM</title>
		<content> Eccleshall Fruit Farm is a            
 small-holding on the western side of  
 the area, next to the A5013 by Four   
 Lane Ends.  It has been set up in the 
 last few years.  It is an example of  
 the recent trend of "picking your own"
 soft fruits.  Strawberries, black,    
 red and whitecurrants, raspberries and
 gooseberries are picked by members of 
 the public at a cost less than local  
 retail prices.  Since 1985 was a wet  
 year the crop was small and the       
 quality was poor. Strawberries sold   
 for 40p a pound.
