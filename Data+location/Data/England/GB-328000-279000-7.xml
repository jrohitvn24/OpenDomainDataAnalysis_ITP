		<content> Mr &amp; Mrs F Williams, the owners of the
 egg farm in Clun, have 6000 hens. They
 produce 5500 eggs a day. Mr &amp; Mrs     
 Williams travel 25-30 miles a day to  
 supply their customers. The farm      
 consists of 3 sheds plus a new shed   
 which is not yet in use.              
 The eggs are sold, per doz., in the

 The hens are crossbred. Mr &amp; Mrs      
 Williams have been in this business   
 for 21 years. Each cage is 18 inches  
 and contains 3 hens. The cages in the
