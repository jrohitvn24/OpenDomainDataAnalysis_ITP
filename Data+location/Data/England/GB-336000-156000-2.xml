		<title>02News from the area July 1985</title>
		<content>    The harvest and haymaking is going 
 very well at the moment, and the short
 dry spell has helped a lot.           
    On the motorway heavy traffic has  
 been reported at the holiday weekends 
 with over two thousand cars an hour   
 being reported travelling southward on
 July 20th 1985.                       
    Heavy rain caused a number of small
 accidents but most people were        
 travelling quite sensibly.            
    Crops in the area have now taken a 
 terrible battering from the atrocious 
 weather and farmers are now having    
 great difficulty in cutting the later 
 corn and wheat.
