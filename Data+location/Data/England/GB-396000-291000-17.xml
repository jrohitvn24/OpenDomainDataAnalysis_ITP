		<title>17Ocker Hill Power Station</title>
		<content> One of the most important features of 
 the Tipton skyline for the greater    
 part  of 20 years hass been the power 
 station at Ocker Hill. The concrete   
 cooling towers opened in 1968 replaced
 the much older wooden ones, and now   
 these are destined to be demolished   
 late in 1985 having been replaced by a
 modern power station.                 
 The two smaller towers are 263 feet   
 tall and were capable of cooling      
 1,680,000 gallons of water per hour,  
 and the larger tower, also 263 feet   
 high was capable of cooling 2,376,000 
 gallons of water per hour.
