		<title>08Our School Fete</title>
		<content> Once a year, on a Saturday in May,our 
 schools Bridge Farm Infant and Junior 
 have a Fete.It is like a party held   
 on the school field,but everyone pays 
 money to come.The profit buys extra   
 things for our schools,like the       
 mini-bus,a disc-drive for the         
 computer and library books.           
 People can buy things like toys,      
 books,comics and plants.They can      
 have rides on the aerial toboggan,the 
 coaster cars,the horse and cart and   
 the roundabout.                       
 They can buy candy-floss,cakes,crisps 
 and ice-cream to eat and tea and      
 orange squash to drink.They can play  
 games like Aunt Sally,Ring-a-Chicken  
 and Hoopla.                           
 The infants enjoy the horse and cart  
 rides and the roundabout rides most of
 all,but everyone has fun.The profit   
 from the Fete this year was Â£800.     </content>
