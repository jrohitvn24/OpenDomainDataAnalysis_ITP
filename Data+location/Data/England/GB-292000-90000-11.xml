		<title>11LUDWELL VALLEY</title>
		<content> The Ludwell Valley has been newly     
 designated a valley park.It is now a  
 recreation area with sports           
 field,childrens play park,a mixed tree
 plantation,walking trails and a stream
 running through,known locally as the  
 Panny.Although the latter is enjoyed  
 by the children it has been used as a 
 rubbish dump.                         
  There is a farm where horses,sheep   
 bullocks,a sow and pigletts were seen 
 grazing. We found oak,ash,beech elder 
 maple,rowan,blackthorn,hazel and may- 
 trees,many newly planted. There is a  
 wide variety of the common wildflowers
 from which we identified 26 species   
 and many different grasses.           
  The mini-beasts found were bees,wasps
 flies,ladybirds,ants,slugs,snails,and 
 cabbagewhite butterflies.Hedgehogs,   
 rabbits and a slow worm were seen.
