		<content> The Keswick Swimming pool will        
 hopefully be built for 1987. We are   
 waiting for permission from Allerdale 
 District council. They have to sort   
 out all the details. They are waiting 
 for someone to put in a price for     
 building it. The station belongs to   
 Lake District planning board and      
 Allerdale District Council also. The  
 special Town Council is also involved.
 The station site was available because
 it is a very suitable place.Inside the
 leisure complex there is going to be a
 lagoon shaped swimming pool.Also a    
 squash site  and a  sauna .It will    
 have  a theatre complex and conference
 centre .In the swimming pool there    
 maybe be a wave machine and a beach.  
 There will be a coffee bar,snack bar  
 and a restaurant.
