		<content>{Edward Heal writes}- The name is of   
 Saxon origin and probably means 'The  
 Valley of Goats'. Some of the 24 homes
 lie along the stream surrounded by    
 farm land in this east-west valley. St
 Olave's Church was built as a memorial
 chapel for the manor mentioned in the 
 original Domesday as belonging to the 
 Estur family. The present elegant Gat-
 combe House dates from 1750 (photo).  
 The I.W.Foxhound have their kennels in
 the village. Many of the cottages were
 built for farmworkers mostly as part  
 of the Seely Estate which was sold up 
 in l926. In about l912 an agreement   
 was made between the Estate and       
 Sandown and Shanklin Council that in  
 return for having a reservoir at Tolt 
 that all the houses should have{free  
{water.}56 people live in the valley at
 Gatcombe.
