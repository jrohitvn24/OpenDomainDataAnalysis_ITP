		<title>12WETHERBY - CENSUS FEATURES</title>
		<content>  The 1981 Census indicated that in    
 Wetherby town the population is mainly
 composed of adults (60%), with        
 children (0-15) forming 23.6% and the 
 aged (over 60) 16.4%. These figures   
 give a Total Dependency Ratio of      
 66.7%. The Census provided evidence of
 male and female emigration in the     
 20-30 age range, a falling birth-rate 
 and an ageing population.             
  It also revealed major social        
 divisions in the town. Simply it can  
 be divided into two areas. A mainly   
 middle-class area in the west and     
 north with high levels of car owner-  
 ship (97% of all households), owner-  
 occupation (100%) and lower than      
 average unemployment (2%). In the     
 south-east is a largely working-class 
 area with lower levels of car         
 ownership (42%), owner-occupation     
 (16%) and higher unemployment (11%).  </content>
