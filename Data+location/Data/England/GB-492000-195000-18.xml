		<title>18WOODROW HIGH HOUSE</title>
		<content> Woodrow High House was given to the   
 London Federation of Boys Clubs by the
 worshipful company of Goldsmiths in   
 1946. The house dates back to about   
 1656, and originally belonged to the  
 Drake family of Shardeloes. Once      
 Oliver Cromwell's wife and daughter   
 lived here. It is used mainly as a    
 training centre and is now run by Mr  
 Hickman (Sarah Hickman is in our      
 class.)Mid-week schools,adult groups  
 etc come,usually running their own    
 courses,and week-ends boys clubs come.
 In the grounds are some  of the rarest
 plants in England,especially the      
 weeping beech.There is a swimming pool
 gymnasium,football pitch,tennis courts
 and assault course.There have been    
 many famous visitors,like the English 
 Olympic boxing team,English football  
 team,Bobby Robson and the Duke of     
 Edinburgh.                            </content>
