		<title>09MY MUMMY IS A NURSE</title>
		<content> Mummy is a nurse. She baths people    
 who are not well and changes their    
 beds and gives them their meals.      
 She gives sick patients medicine and  
 helps the doctors to operate on them  
 if they need an operation.            
 If Mummy is looking after sick        
 children she has to make sure their   
 mummies and daddies know what is      
 happening to their little boys and    
 girls. Everything is explained to     
 them.                                 
 She makes sure all patients are happy 
 and when they come out of hospital the
 district nurse visits them.           
 I am pleased when I tell all my       
 friends at school that my mummy is a  
 nurse.
