		<title>15THE VILLAGE OF UPPER HOPTON</title>
		<content>{Upper Hopton} is a blend of "old and  
 new". The population is approx.{986,  
 divided into those who have lived     
 there many years and a more mobile    
 population in the new estate. The     
 oldest building - {The Hall}- dates   
 back to Tudor times, and {the village 
{school}for children aged 5 to 9 is lO5
 years old. {The church}is picturesque,
 surrounded by numerous daffodils in   
 Springtime. The indigenous population 
 has taken time to welcome the new     
 residents, but since the formation of 
 a {Community Assoc.}the village is    
 gradually coming to terms with the    
 changed environment. There are no     
 employment opportunities in the       
 village apart from a few farms. Most  
 people  travel to{Leeds, Huddersfield,
{Dewsbury or Manchester}for work. There
 is little unemployment, generally this
 is an affluent area.                  </content>
