		<title>04LITTLE HORKESLEY HALL</title>
		<content> The hall,once the manor house of      
 Lt.Horkesley has been demolished and  
 rebuilt several times since its Saxon 
 beginnings.Major General De Hainlland 
 now lives in the hall,although his    
 deceased wifes family,the             
 otter_Barrys,still have possession.The
 building,once grand,is in need of some
 repair and many of the rooms are      
 closed as only one person lives there.
 The garden once beautiful and well    
 kept is gradually being taken over by 
 weeds and horses.Two oak trees remain 
 at the side of the house,evidence that
 once the road ran through an avenue of
 oak trees to the front of the Church. 
 A previous owner of the hall felled   
 the trees and re_routed the road      
 because he felt that it was to close  
 to the house.
