village is served by a water mains,    
overhead electricity mains and a mains 
sewer.                                 
  There is a church ,a public house    
serving food,and the  village is also  
served by a mobile library.            
  A minor road disects the area        
running North West to South East.There 
was a bus service for a few years.This 
was discontinued in the 1970s.         
  Alongside the road through Lower     
Weald is a flood drainage ditch.During 
very heavy rainstorms this is          
inadequate. Occasionally some houses   
are affected.
