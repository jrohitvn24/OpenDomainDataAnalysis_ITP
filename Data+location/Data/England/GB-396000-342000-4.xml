		<title>04Farming in Dilhorne</title>
		<content>   Dilhorne is a predominatly farming  
community made up of family sized farms
employing only one or two workers other
than the family.                       
   Dairy farming and the raising of    
cattle is the major concern. There is  
no cereal grown but the roaming and    
undulating landscape provides pasture  
for the cattle and silage for winter   
feed.Some farms specialise in rearing  
calves till they are fully grown and   
then sell them whilest others will buy 
them fully grown.A few keep hens and   
one farm actually factory farms hens   
for the sale of the eggs to the local  
market.Another side line is that of    
sheep rearing for the wool.            
   Most of the farms in Dilhorne are   
very old and this is reflected in the  
age of the farmhouses.The original     
estate belong to the manor but this    
was graduly sold off over the years.   </content>
