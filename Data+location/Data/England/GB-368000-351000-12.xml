		<title>12CHILDRENS' GAMES</title>
		<content> A large variety of games is played by 
 children both at home and school. Here
 are just two.                         
{Coloured eggs.}One person is the wolf,
  another the hen, the rest eggs. The  
 eggs each choose a colour. The hen    
 calls the wolf who comes across and   
 knocks on her back asking if she has  
 any coloured eggs. She tells him the  
 colours. He calls one out; the egg of 
 that colour has to run for home. If   
 caught, she becomes wolf.             
{Kerbsy.}This is played by two people  
 with a ball across a quiet road. The  
 ball is thrown at the kerb. A         
 two-handed catch gains two points, a  
 one-handed catch three points. The    
 first to a set total wins the game.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
