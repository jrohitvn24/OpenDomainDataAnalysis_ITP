		<title>12Sewage Works</title>
		<content> Meltham sewage works was opened on    
 the 17th of September 1973. It deals  
 with sewage from Meltham and the      
 village of Helme. It can cope with 3.3
 million gallons of raw sewage a day   
 when required. The sewage is first    
 filtered and then goes into 2 primary 
 settling tanks where the solids settle
 into the bottom. From the primary     
 tanks the sewage goes into eight      
 biological filter tanks where the     
 insects eat the sewage. These tanks   
 are 6 to 7 feet deep and the water is 
 distributed around the top of the     
 tanks by jets. This process is        
 repeated in what are called secondary 
 biological treatment tanks. When this 
 treatment is completed the water is   
 released into Hall Dyke.              
  The sludge that is left in the       
 primary settling tanks is taken away  
 and turned into fertilizer.           </content>
