		<content>  From a small, but representative     
 sample of questionnaires we found that
 very few people from the village      
 actually worked in South Cerney       
 itself. They mostly worked in Swindon 
 or Cirencester, travelling by car, a  
 distance of between 4 and 16 miles    
 each way. However, most people did    
 feel that they would have liked to    
 work in the village, had there been   
 opportunity to do so. Some of those   
 interviewed were dentists, teachers   
 and policemen and the others were     
 employed in small firms or service    
 industries.                           
  Few would welcome additional industry
 in South Cerney, since this would be  
 detrimental to its atmosphere, though 
 an increase in shopping facilities,   
 with a resultant increase in employ-  
 ment, would be welcomed by many.
