		<title>15SPORTS CENTRES (2)</title>
		<content> The nearest sports centre to where I  
 live is the George H. Carnall Centre. 
 I sometimes go there with my friend   
 Jillian to do "pop mobility". They do 
 other things as well like Karate,     
 squash,badmington, weight training and
 basketball. They are also building a  
 swimming pool there. At Sale sports   
 Centre they do things in the summer   
 holidays for children. The nearest    
 swimming baths to where I live is near
 The Curzon. It is quite an old baths  
 and they give swimming lessons there. 
 At Sale they give you a coloured band.
 When your coloured light shines you   
 have to get out. They have a small    
 pool for beginners and a big pool,    
 with four diving boards. In the gym in
 the George H. Carnell Centre they have
 an exercise bike, a lot of weights,   
 changing rooms and showers. Stretford 
 has a sports centre too.              </content>
