 of gently rolling, wooded slopes,     
 covering coal measures, with natural

 There is{farming}mainly evident north 
 of the East Lancs Road and Carr Mill  
 Dam, a man-made water. The housing was
 originally linear along West End Road 
 and Clipsley Lane, which grew up as a 
 now extinct mining community. Since

 between the man-made barriers of the  
 East Lancs Road and the line of the   
 old Sankey Canal.{Eyesores}are common,
 with derelict houses and land,        
{industrial development}and a mining   
 spoil/rubbish tip which is now being  
 remodelled as a golf course.
