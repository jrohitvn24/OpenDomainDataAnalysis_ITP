		<title>19SHOPPING IN THE D-BLOCK</title>
		<content>   In the whole of our D-Block only two
 individual squares have shopping      
 facilities and these are centred on   
 Purston Jaglin.                       
  Purston has a large range of shops   
 and services. As well as the usual    
 smaller shops it also has estate      
 agents, banks, furniture shops, a     
 chemists and, as befits its location, 
 a betting shop.                       
  Every house in Purston is within easy
 walking distance of a Post Office and 
 Newsagents. In the outlying villages  
 of Hessle and West Hardwick the       
 inhabitants have to travel by car to  
 do their shopping, as their community 
 has no shopping facilities of any kind
  There is a wider variety and number  
 of shops in the neighbouring community
 of Featherstone. Most locals however  
 do their major shopping in the nearby 
 larger town of Pontefract.            </content>
