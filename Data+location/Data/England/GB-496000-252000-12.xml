		<title>12Church Life in Stevington</title>
		<content> There are many Baptists whose forbears
 have lived here for generations.John  
 Bunyan,a Bedford man,preached some    
 three hundred years ago in the lovely 
 seventeenth century chapel in West End
 Stevington.The Parish Church dates    
 from the ninth century.It overlooks   
 the meadows bordering the River       
 Ouse.Great pride is taken in keeping  
 the churchyard tidy.The vicarage is   
 now a private residence.The Vicar,a   
 recently ordained retired County      
 Planning Officer,lives in the next    
 village.He has restarted the Sunday   
 School,increased church attendance and
 assisted towards raising the large sum
 of money needed to restore the fabric 
 of the church.Once there was a        
 Methodist Chapel but this is now an   
 organ workshop.Roman Catholics have to
 travel to Harrold,Clapham or Bedford  
 to worship.                           </content>
