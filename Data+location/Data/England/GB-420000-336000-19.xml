		<content>    The Women's Institute still plays a
 very active part in the life of       
 Longford village. It has 28 members.  
    Some of our members are elderly;   
 many are the wives of farmers. We are 
 hoping to recruit some younger ones.  
    Next year is our 60th anniversary, 
 of which we are very proud.           
    We meet in the Pump Room (at the   
 Pump House) once a month. In the      
 summer we meet in the evenings, in the
 winter in the afternoons.             
    We have varied speakers with       
 subjects from Gardens to Alternative  
 Medicine.                             
    Every year we have a charity event.
 Last year we raised Â£332 for the Derby
 Scanner appeal.                       
    We still make jam and do crafts,   
 but we have widened our scope to      
 include games, sports, arts and more  
 controversial subjects.               </content>
