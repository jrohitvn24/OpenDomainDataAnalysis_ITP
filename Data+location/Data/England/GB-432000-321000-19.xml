		<content>{How I help Muscular Distrophy}        
                                       
  My Mum and Dad have some friends who 
 have a disease called Muscular        
 Distrophy. They can't walk but have to
 sit in wheelchairs all the time.      
                                       
  We try to help people who have       
 Muscular Distrophy by raising money.  
 One way is by having sponsored events.
 My Dad had a{sponsored slim.}People   
 gave him money for every pound in     
 weight that he lost. I did a{sponsored
{walk}with my friends.I raised more    
 than Â£20 doing that.                  
  Another way we raise money is by     
 having{car boot sales}on the pub car  
 park. People put things they don't    
 want, like toys, books, pots, into    
 their car boots and then sell them.
