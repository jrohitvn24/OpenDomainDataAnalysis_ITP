		<title>18SHEERNESS CHAMBER OF TRADE</title>
		<content>    {THE CHAMBER OF TRADE}HAS ROUGHLY  
 70 MEMBERS AND TRIES TO LOOK AFTER THE
 LOCAL COMMUNITY BY DOING SUCH THINGS  
 AS TIDYING THE SHOP FRONTS AND PUTTING
 FLOWERS AROUND THE TOWN.              
     THE CHAMBER OF TRADE TRIES TO     
 ENCOURAGE ON-ISLAND SHOPPING AND ALSO 
 TRIES TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHORITIES TO 
 USE LOCAL CONTRACTORS. THE MEMBERSHIP 
 OF THE CHAMBER HAS STAYED ROUGHLY THE 
 SAME OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS BECAUSE,   
 ALTHOUGH BUSINESSES HAVE GONE BANKRUPT
 NEW BUSINESSES HAVE TAKEN THEIR PLACE.
 THE CHAMBER IS WORRIED THAT THE NEW   
 BUSINESSES HAVE INCLUDED SOME CHARITY 
 SHOPS WHICH PAY NO RENT OR RATES.     
     SHEERNESS USED TO BE A SEA-SIDE   
 TOWN FOR HOLIDAY MAKERS WHICH BROUGHT 
 TADE TO THE AREA BUT THIS HAS SLUMPED 
 OFF IN RECENT YEARS SO THE TRADERS    
 HAVE TO TRY HARDER TO ATTRACT THE     
 CUSTOM OF LOCAL RESIDENTS.            </content>
