		<title>17GOOLE CHILD'S VIEW OF SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  School is a very{important}part of a 
 child's life since nowadays it        
 provides many{opportunities}to learn. 
  Many youngsters' lives revolve around
 school since it provides the backbone 
 of the{social}structure of their      
 existence.                            
  At school there is an atmosphere     
 suitable for{working}whereas at home  
 it is far more relaxed.This difference
 can create{problems}at home which     
 affect schoolwork and behaviour in    
 lessons and cause conflict with       
 teachers.{Homework,}depending on the  
 ability of the child, can last a long 
 time which also causes a lot of       
{stress.                               
  The various subjects can only be made
 interesting by the teacher's attitudes
 and methods. I like a{teacher}who is  
 strict, has a sense of humour and     
 makes learning enjoyable.             </content>
