		<title>18Crowthorne Library</title>
		<content>    Our library is a bright modern     
 building. It houses{books}for adults  
 and children,{magazines, tapes}and    
{records,}all of which may be borrowed 
 by the people of Crowthorne.          
    The library also acts as a{source  
{of information}about activities and   
 events in the village. From time to   
 time the schools in the village mount 
{exhibitions of work.                  
    Last year 1500 people joined the   
 library which is{computer linked}to   
 others in Berkshire and across the    
 country. It is even possible now to   
 trace a book in another country!      
    The most{popular books}borrowed    
 from the library were{historical      
{romantic novels.                      
    Following a visit to Africa, our   
 librarian launched an appeal for      
 children's books.These are due to be  
 sent to the Gambia shortly.           </content>
