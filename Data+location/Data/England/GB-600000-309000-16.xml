		<title>16Yaxham Church</title>
		<content> This round towered church was built   
 over 1000 years ago.The tower is built
 up with bands of flint,carrstone and  
 conglomerate stones;this is a Saxon   
 feature.The south porch entrance was  
 added in about 1390.Above the south   
 aisle is a sundial,a copy of which is 
 on the village sign,which also shows  
 the church.Inside the church at the   
 entrance to the belfry is an opening  
 in the wall,about 7 metres from the   
 ground.Many years ago the only way    
 into the tower was by using a rope    
 ladder which could be pulled up       
 through the opening.This was done many
 years ago when the country was invaded
 and the church as a fortress.There    
 used to be five bells;the oldest was  
 made by a John Draper of Norwich in   
 1625.
