		<title>14Living in a small village</title>
		<content> Living in a small village is          
 satisfactory if a person has a car    
 as it is necessary to travel for many 
 amenities.                            
 There are local events such a         
 concerts, socials, coffee evenings and
 a floral club in the Parish Hall. But 
 the Women's Institute and Young       
 Farmers Clubs are based in the        
 neighbouring village of {Kirklinton.} 
 There are no shops and the nearest    
 doctor's surgery is in {Brampton} or{ 
{Longtown}six miles away.              
               *******                 
 Form 2G of Eden School, Rickerby,     
 Carlisle particularly wish to thank   
 Mrs. Kate Little, Mr. John Hardy,     
 Rev.Ronald Leatherbarrow, Mrs. E.     
 Watson and the staff of Carlisle City 
 Library for their help.
