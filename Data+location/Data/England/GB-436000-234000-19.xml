		<content> SWALCLIFFE COMMON IS A PROTECTED AREA 
 OF OUR D-BLOCK, FAMOUS LOCALLY FOR ITS
 CONTRAST TO ITS INTENSIVELY-FARMED    
 SURROUNDINGS.THE WILDLIFE &amp; PLANT-LIFE
 OF THE COMMON ARE UNSPOILT AND        
 CHERISHED BY THE LOCALS INHABITANTS.  
 AT ANY TIME OF THE YEAR THE COMMON    
 HOLDS INTEREST FOR THE VISITOR,       
 WHETHER IT BE SEARCHING FOR WILD      
 FLOWERS SUCH AS ORCHIDS, EVIDENCE OF  
 WILD ANIMALS SUCH AS RABBITS, BADGERS 
 AND FOXES OR JUST PEACE AND QUIET.    
 SPECTACULAR PHOTOGRAPHY IS POSSIBLE IN
 WINTER ESPECIALLY; IN SUMMER THE      
 UNDERGROWTH BECOMES OVERGROWN AND LUSH
 AND OFTEN DIFFICULT TO WALK THROUGH.  
 THE BIRDS SING LOUDLY AT ALL TIMES OF 
 THE YEAR AND IT IS CERTAINLY A        
 HIGHLIGHT OF OUR D-BLOCK OF STUDY.
