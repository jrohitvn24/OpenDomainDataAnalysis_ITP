		<title>04A LARGE FARM IN WENT HILLS</title>
		<content>    The{Stapleton Estate}is a very     
 large{arable farm employing}ten       
 workers. The farm covers two thousand 
 acres. Wheat and barley are grown and 
 sold through a merchant. Some goes for
 export. The sugarbeet is{transported  
 down the A1 to Nottingham for         
 processing. Mustard is grown for a    
 company based in Norwich. Peas are    
 grown for sale locally and for        
 freezing by a freezer plant which is  
 partly owned by the owner of Stapleton
 Park. The Estate has facilities for   
 washing the peas before sending them  
 for freezing.                         
    The{Farm Shop}in{Darrington}belongs
 to the Estate, but is rented out. It  
 still sells peas from the Estate. The 
 former fishponds of Stapleton Hall are
 stocked with trout, and the{fishing   
{rights}are privately leased.
