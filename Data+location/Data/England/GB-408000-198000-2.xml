		<title>02MEYSEY HAMPTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  The village of Meysey Hampton is a   
 small village. We have a shop/post    
 office and a Memorial Hall. Next to   
 the hall is the school and further    
 down the road is St. Mary's Church. Up
 the road a bit, you come to the green 
 with the pump and a seat to rest on.  
 Across the road there is a playing    
 field and further down there is a     
 nursery school.                       
  There are three farms in Meysey      
 Hampton: one owned by Mr Pursch,      
 another by Mr Caroe, and the third by 
 Mr Breton.                            
  We have a pub called the Mason's     
 Arms.
