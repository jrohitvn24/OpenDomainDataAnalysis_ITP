		<title>13WILDLIFE IN THE HIGH WEALD</title>
		<content> Many of the estates have large areas  
 which are rarely disturbed by man and 
 therefore an ideal environment for all
 types of wildlife.{Deer}are often seen
 on walks and the fallow deer make     
 sorties into gardens. Foxes, badgers, 
 stoats and weasels, grey squirrels,   
 and in the evening bats can be found. 
{Rabbits}have recently been the victims
 of{myxomatosis,}so are fewer in       
 numbers in 1985 than usual. Pheasants,
 partridges, wild duck and some hares  
 make pleasant hunting for foxes.      
   All the well known varieties of     
{birds}such as robins, tits and        
 thrushes abound, and woodpeckers,     
 hawks, kestrels and owls also. Many   
 common{butterflies}can be seen plus   
 the Purple Emperor and White Admiral. 
 Crested Newts are found in the ponds. 
 There are many grass{snakes,}sometimes
 adders and various ants and spiders.  </content>
