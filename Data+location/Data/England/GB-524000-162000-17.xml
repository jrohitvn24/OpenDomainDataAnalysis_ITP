		<title>17Cheam Village, Surrey.</title>
		<content> Cheam is a spring line village of     
 Saxon origin at the northern edge of  
 the chalk North Downs. For many       
 centuries there were two separate     
 clusters of houses which today are    
 identifiable as separate shopping     
 areas. Cheam retained its pleasant    
 rural atmosphere until the present    
 century when the village centre was   
 almost totally redeveloped following  
 large scale suburban development made 
 possible by the opening of the railway
 and the provision of piped water.     
 There are some weather_boarded, flint,
 timber_framed and Elizabethan brick   
 buildings but most buildings are      
 Victorian or twentieth century. There 
 are two churches, a library, a modest 
 selection of 'convenience' shops for  
 the local population and other basic  
 amenities. Beyond is the pleasant and 
 historic Nonsuch Park.                </content>
