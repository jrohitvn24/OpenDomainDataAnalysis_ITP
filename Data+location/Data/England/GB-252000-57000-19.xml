		<content>   The Albatross Gliding Club wants to 
 build a new airfield at Newnham Park. 
 It is to have a new club house and    
 glider hanger.Their club is now at    
 Camelford in Cornwall but lots of     
 members live in Plymouth and want it  
 to be closer.                         
   A local commercial airline based at 
 Plymouth Airport object to the        
 airfield as it could cause danger for 
 aircrafts going to and from Plymouth  
 Airport.The C.A.A.want a special      
 safety agreement put forward if the   
 club is to be built.The airport       
 manager said that an agreement like   
 this would be completely unworkable.  
   Council planners are considering the
 plans.There will be a public inquiry  
 on the 13 August.                     
   By July 2nd work had already started
 on leveling the proposed site.
