         {UNEMPLOYMENT }is high        
 throughout the country and such small 
 scale schemes are being encouraged by 
 the ruling Conservative Party led by  
 Margaret Thatcher.Unemployment is     
 particularly high amongst the young   
 and unskilled.School leavers who are  
 unable to find employment are able to 
 develop skills through Government     
 sponsored and financed work schemes.  
      This part of Gloucestershire has 
 not been so adversely affected by the 
 economic recession as other counties. </content>
