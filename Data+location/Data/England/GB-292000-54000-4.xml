  There are five beaches in Brixham.   
 They are:- Breakwater, St. Mary's Bay,
 Fishcombe, Mansands and Churston.     
  St. Mary's is sandy and stony. It has
 one shop. There are three ways of     
 getting down to this beach, the       
 steps, the muddy cliff way by the     
 shop and the cliff itself.            
  Breakwater Beach has a shop. There   
 are two ways of getting to this       
 beach, by the slipway or by the       
 steps. There is a raft at             
 Breakwater, you can fish down there,  
 you can jump or dive off the rocks.   
  Fishcombe beach has a raft and       
 every Wednesday there they hold a     
 competition which is for everyone.    
 Adults pay 10p to enter and children  
 pay 5p..
