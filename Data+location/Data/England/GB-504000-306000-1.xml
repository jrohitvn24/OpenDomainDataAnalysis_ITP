		<title>01A Description of our area.</title>
		<content> Our area is fairly flat, the highest  
 point is about 40 metres above sea    
 level. The land is mostly used for    
 crops with some pasture. Most of the  
 area south of the River Welland is    
 parkland belonging to Burghley Estate.
 North of the river belonged to the    
 Barclay Harvey family who lived at    
 Uffington house, but it is now let or 
 owned by local farmers who live in or 
 near Uffington, a village of about 400
 people. The main features are Burghley
 House and Uffington Church. The older 
 stone built houses have slate roofs.  
 There is also a small modern housing  
 estate.The main A16road goes east/west
 through the village carrying quite    
 heavy traffic. The Peterborough /     
 Leicester railway line also runs east/
 west along_side the River Welland.    
 Tall metal pylons have been erected   
 over many fields to carry electricity.</content>
