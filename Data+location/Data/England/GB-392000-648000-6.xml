		<content> The church seats 334 people,the entire
 population of the village,but there   
 being only 63 members,it is only      
 filled on two or three occasions      
 annually.There have been 15 ministers 
 since the chuch was founded. In 1876  
 the Presbyterian Church in England    
 united with the English congregations 
 of United Presbyterian Church to      
 become the Presbyterian Church of Eng_
 land.In 1972 a further union with the 
 Congregational Church of England and  
 Wales brought into being the United   
 Reform Church.Links first formed with 
 Norham about 100 years before were    
 strengthened when in the early 1970s  
 the two congregations were united     
 under one minister living in Horn_    
 cliffe.Without a minister thge church 
 is still active with  Sunday Worship  
 and School,womens' meeting and        
 provides for a play group etc.        </content>
