		<content> Mr.'Bert'Barnes and Mrs.'Queenie'     
 Barnes live on Folgate Lane, Walpole  
 St. Peter.Both are over 70 years of   
 age but think nothing of cycling ten  
 or twenty miles in the course of a    
 day.They have,however,become known    
 nationally becuse of this exploits    
 when cycling abroad.Some two years ago
 thay cycled from coast to coast across
 CANADA and have spent their time since
 cycling to meetings where they have   
 shown their slides and talk about     
 their experiences.although in the     
 process of planning a summer cycling  
 vacation to Wales,their next ambition 
 is to cycle coast to coast across     
 AUSTRALIA.This they hope to do in     
 1987.They make the interesting comment
 that they feel safer cycling in towns 
 and cities rather than along country  
 lanes.
