 There used to be a lot of traffic     
 going through the village.Then a      
 by-pass was built four years ago. It  
 was to stop noise and vibration       
 through west street.There is not so   
 much traffic now.North street has been
 blocked at the end by a fence.There is
 a new surgery it has moved from Roke  
 road to Manor Farm Road and is very   
 nice.There is an old peoples home     
 which was built when the council      
 estate was built it is called         
 Turberville Court.There are two new   
 antique shops and one coffee          
 shop.Beamisters has closed down so    
 has the hairdressing salon.There is no
 Woodbury Fair,street market and there 
 are no more fairs in the recreational 
 grounds.
