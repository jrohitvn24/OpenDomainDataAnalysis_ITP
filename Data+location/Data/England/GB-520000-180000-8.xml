		<content>Most of the industry in the North      
Hammersmith and College Park area is   
connected with television and the      
media. The British Broadcasting Company
(B.B.C)employ a large amount of people 
and most of the industry in the        
Industrial Estates is involved with    
television,mainly for making scenery.  
Industry in the north-west of the area 
is also connected with steel and metal 
works. This is then transported along  
the canal. The railway, the            
underground railway and the bus routes 
also provide a large proportion of the 
industry in the area,especially at the 
railway depot and bus terminus.        
Industry on the whole has declined over
the past few years as many factories   
hav moved to cheaper areas or closed   
down entirely.
