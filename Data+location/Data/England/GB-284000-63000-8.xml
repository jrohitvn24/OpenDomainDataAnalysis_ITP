 had a least 1 T.V. colour set and all 
 adults watched some T.V. The{favourite
{programmes were}sport, "soap operas"  
 like 'Dynasty' and 'Crossroads' &amp; quiz

 coming favourite. 1/2 the sample had a
 video recorder &amp; watched programmes   
 taped at home. They also hired a tape 
 from a shop at least once a week.     
 The average viewing time of{children  
{between 7 &amp; 9 years} was 16 hours each
 week.The average for the 9 to 11 years
 rose to 26 hours a week. Apart from   
 one soap opera all the favourite      
 programmes watched by the younger     
 children were cartoons that were shown
 around tea time. The older children   
 also enjoyed watchng cartoons but the 
 favourite programmes were more varied,
 often adult programmes and late in the
 evening.                              </content>
