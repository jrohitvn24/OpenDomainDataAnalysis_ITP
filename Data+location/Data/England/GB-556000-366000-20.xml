		<content> In the 1920s,the few visitors there   
 were used to stay at the Ship Hotel,  
 either of 2 farms,or self cater in a  
 few wooden huts left from the first   
 world war.In the 1930s a few caravans 
 were sited near the sea and several   
 bungalows built down Sea Lane.In 1936,
 Butlin's Camp opened but soon closed  
 due to the war.On the beaches metal   
 stakes were placed along with barbed  
 wire.At the top of Sea Lane there was 
 a large gun pointing out to sea. Now  
 Ingoldmells had few visitors,as the   
 many strangers were members of the    
 Armed Forces stationed in the area. In
 1946 Butlin's re-opened and there was 
 a gradual increase in the number of   
 caravans and chalets,but it was not   
 until after the 1953 Floods that      
 caravan sites were really expanded.   
 Today they can cater for up to 800    
 vans with many amenities available.   </content>
