		<title>12GODLINGSTON FARM SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   Godlingston Manor farm consists of  
 240 acres of farming land and 237     
 acres of woodland and hills. It is a  
 dairy farm with over 100 cows and a   
 bull called William. Most of the land 
 is used for grazing, silage and hay.  
 The rest is used for growing wheat and
 barley. Most of the farms in Purbeck  
 are small; Godlingston is one of the  
 largest. Three men work at Godlingston
 with up to date equipment. The farmer 
 can milk 110 cows in 2 hours and get  
 519,000 litres of milk each day. He is
 paid 14p per litre in the Winter and  
 10p per litre in the Summer.          
   Godlingston is owned by the National
 Trust and contains many wild animals  
 and flowers including orchids. There  
 is also a secret colony of the rare   
 Adonis Blue butterfly.
