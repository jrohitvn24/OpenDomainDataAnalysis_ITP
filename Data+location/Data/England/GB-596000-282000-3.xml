		<title>03FOREST AND FIELD</title>
		<content>  Two types of landscape prevail in    
 this                                  
 area - forest and field.  The North   
 West is covered with pine forest, its 
 verges planted with a variety of      
 deciduous trees which provide both    
 interest and contrast to the massed   
 conifers.  There are several large    
 clearings where the timber has been   
 felled and old roots piled into wind  
 breaks to shelter the newly planted   
 saplings.                             
 Immediately outside the afforested    
 area the landscpae becomes that of    
 fairly large fields, mostly used for  
 the growing of arable crops, divided  
 by low hedges and fringed with shrubs 
 and trees that are reminders of the   
 more old fashioned hedgerows.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
