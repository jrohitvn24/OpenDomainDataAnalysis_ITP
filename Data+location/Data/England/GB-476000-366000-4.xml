		<content>{ Weston Mill}is the largest family    
 business in the area, with its offices
 and most buildings at{Mill Farm.}     
 There are 5 different farm properties 
 involved, two of which, Mill Farm and{
{Crow Park Farm}are in the survey area.
 The entire business is run by 8       
 full-time workers plus office staff,  
 with casual labour at busy times. Many
 of the roads on Weston Mill properties
 are gated and signposted as private   
 roads, and members of the public may  
 not use them without permission.      
  All the smaller farms in the area are
 owned and worked by family units. For 
 most of the time the family runs the  
 farm without outside help, but at busy
 times they may have extra labour.     
 These farms often have to hire their  
 larger machinery at harvest time,     
 possibly using one of the 5 combines  
 owned by Weston Mill.                 </content>
