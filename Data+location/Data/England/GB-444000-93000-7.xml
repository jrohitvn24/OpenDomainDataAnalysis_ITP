		<title>07DUKES FARM NEAR GURNARD.</title>
		<content> Dukes Farm is in Rew Street. Mrs.     
 Jollife and her brother Mr.Flux run   
 it.It is a dairy farm and there are   
 about 60 milking cows in the herd.At  
 present they have Guernsey cows but   
 they are changing to Friesans because 
 people don't want the rich,creamy     
 milk.They also keep beef cattle and   
 pigs and there is a 7 year old        
 Hereford bull called William which is 
 kept in a pen.The crops they grow are 
 corn and grass.The grass is used for  
 feeding the cows and for silage.Silage
 is cut twice a year and is stored     
 in the farmyard,covered by black      
 plastic sheeting,with old tractor     
 tyres on top to stop the sheeting     
 blowing away in the wind.             
 They also keep a few pigs,ducks and   
 chickens for there own use.
