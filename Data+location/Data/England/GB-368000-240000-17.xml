		<content> The{local school closed}in 1955 and   
 all  children{travel}to schools in    
 Ledbury or Colwall. As the village is 
 within a 3 mile radius of either      
 school, children{must pay for the     
{bus,}which is a{sore point.}However,  
 villagers are also allowed to use this
{bus}which is useful,as otherwise there
 is only a once{weekly private service.
 The local shop and Post Office closed 
 4 years ago and there is only a{milk  
{and a baker's round.}The{milkman}also 
{delivers information}twice yearly, ie 
 slips of paper produced by the  Parish
 Council and the Memorial Hall, which  
{report on the village organisations.  
 Apart from this there are{four inform-
{ation}notice boards in the village.   
 There is a fortnightly{collection of  
{refuse}and a{mobile library}visits the
 area once a month.                    
 There is a{Nurse and Health Visitor.  </content>
