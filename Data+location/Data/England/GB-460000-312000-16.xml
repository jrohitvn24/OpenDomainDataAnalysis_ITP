		<title>16An interview with Mr Farrar</title>
		<content> I interviewed my dad because he is a  
 lorry driver and soon lorry driving   
 will have changed.There might not even
 be lorry drivers in ten years because 
 lorrys may be remote control by then. 
 The weight of his lorry is 15.5tons   
 when it is fully loaded.              
 His present lorrys registration number
 is VBC 596X.                          
 My dad was 28 when he started lorry   
 driving so he has been a lorry driver 
 for 10 years.They do quite a few local
 calls a day and usually they do 10.   
 His lorry is comfortable when it is   
 moving but sometimes he gets lonely in
 his cab.                              
 At night they park the lorrys in the  
 warehouse.                            
 He said that he doesn't know if he    
 will be a lorry driver until he is 65.
