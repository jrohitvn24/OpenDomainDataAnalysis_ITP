		<title>11Wickhamford Church - one</title>
		<content>  This Church is named after St.John   
 the Baptist. It stands in the Manor   
 grounds, which once belonged to       
 the Abbey in Evesham.The monks        
 visiting the Manor would have         
 worshiped there. This makes it        
 understandable that the church is     
 comparitively small and has a cosy    
 atmosphere.                           
  The oldest part of this building is  
 the chancel which is 700 years old.   
 The nave was built in Stuart times,   
 then later on the tower was built in  
 1986.                                 
  The wooden pulpit is unusual. It is a
 three decker, the lectern, Vicar's    
 seat and pulpit proper. The roof is   
 made from strong oak beams in a design
 called "queen posts." At the west end 
 there is a gallery for the choir with 
 a panelled front. There are two kinds 
 of pews.                              </content>
