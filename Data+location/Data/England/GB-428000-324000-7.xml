		<title>07Schooling of local children</title>
		<content> The {United Reformed Play-School} has 
 thirty seven children from 2 months to
 5 years, most of them from  Repton. On
 the day we visited, some of them were 
 visiting the Zoo.                     
{St.Wystans Primary School }has        
 children from about 2 to 11 years old.
 There are 100 children coming from    
 Burton, Newton Solney and Derby. Many 
 of these go on to Abbots Bromley or   
 Malvern if they are girls or to       
 Foremarke Hall or the local state     
 school (John Port) if they are boys.  
 The {Church of England aided }school  
 at Newton Solney was built in 1860 and
 caters for 73 children.The school was 
 due to be closed but recently has been
 saved by very strong local support.   
 The largest school (apart from {Repton
{School) }is the{local village school} 
 which has now moved to new builbings  
 on the edge of the village.           </content>
