		<title>07HISTORICAL NOTES WELBURY</title>
		<content> Welbury was mentioned in the original 
 Domesday Book as Welleburga.King John 
 is reputed to have visited the village
 in 1199 to confirm the sale of land   
 from Wm.Ingram of Welbury.Much of the 
 area was destroyed by the Scots in    
 1319. By 1800 most of the land was    
 owned by the 1st Earl of Harewood.    
 This was gradually sold into private  
 ownersip during the 20th.century.In   
 1850 the railway was opened, by 1900  
 there were 17 men working at the      
 station and marshalling yard at the   
 southern end of the village.All that  
 remains now is a level crossing.The   
 village inn is an eighteenth century  
 building.After 30 years under the     
 ownership of Mr.&amp;Mrs.Bill Turnbull it 
 has recently changed hands to Mr.&amp;    
 Mrs.J.D.Salton.In the 1800's linen was
 woven from flax and transported daily 
 to Osmotherly by donkey for bleaching.</content>
