		<content>    The District Council is responsible
 for housing and planning. The County  
 Council looks after education, roads  
 police and the fire service. They both
 collect rates. The District Council   
 meets once a month. Mrs. Della Jones  
 is our District Councillor and our    
 County Councillor.She sits on a lot   
 of committees. The elections for the  
 councils  are every four years,       
 and everyboby over eighteen can vote. 
 The biggest problem is finding jobs   
 for people. The North Dorset District 
 Council has trouble with some flies   
 which breed in the river and bite     
 people.                               
      The District Council meets in    
 Blandford and the Council meets in    
 Dorchester.
