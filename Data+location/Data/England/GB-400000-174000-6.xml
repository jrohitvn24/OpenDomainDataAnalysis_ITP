		<content> Every Wednesday at 5.30 there is Youth
 Club at Goatacre Village Hall or on   
 the field next to it. When we arrive  
 we give our money in, then if the     
 weather is good we play rounders. If  
 the weather is bad we play skittles.  
 There is sometimes bingo with a prize 
 for the winner. There is a tuck shop  
 where we can buy penny sweets. There  
 is a drawing competition and a raffle.
 The children come from Hilmarton,     
 Goatacre, Spirthill and other smaller 
 places nearby.                        
 Another activity is cricket practice. 
 It is held every Saturday in the      
 summer unless the weather is bad. It  
 starts at 10.30 and ends at 12.30.    
 Those of us without our own kit use   
 the Clubs.We practice batting, bowling
 and fielding and then we have a       
 game.About 18 people come, from places
 like Goatacre, Calne and Spirthill.   </content>
