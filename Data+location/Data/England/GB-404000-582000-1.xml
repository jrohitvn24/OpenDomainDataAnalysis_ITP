		<content> South Middleton Deserted Village is   
 considered by Hoskins to be one of the
 best in the country. The streets and  
 house sites show up in an are that can
 not be ploughed. Ridge and furrow show
 the old open fields. Devils Causeway  
 passes through the area. On Shaftoe   
 Crags are a native settlement and hill
 fort with a tumulus and standing stone
 prominent nearby. Grassland has been  
 improved,rough pasture reseeded. Some 
 corn and forage crops are grown,more  
 silage and less hay. Middleton Mill is
 dairy farm with milk around. The area 
 is very attractive to view with       
 fringes of crags clumps of trees and  
 meandering Wansbeck. Bolam Country    
 Park is to south and Bolam village to 
 east. Wallington lies to the west. The
 railway from Morpeth to Scots Gap     
 closed in 1962. School buses are the  
  only public transport.               </content>
