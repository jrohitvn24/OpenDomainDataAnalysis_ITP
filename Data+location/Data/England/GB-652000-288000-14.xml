		<content>Pakefield Beach is a favourite spot for
{anglers} from all over the British    
Isles. National competitions are held  
there. At G.R. 535 908 is a large open 
space called Walmer Recreation Ground. 
This is used by local {sports} clubs   
throughout the year for cricket, hockey
and football. Close by at G.R. 534 908 
is the headquarters of the Lowestoft   
Athletics Club with facilities for     
field and track events. Until 1979 this
land formed part of the Lowestoft Golf 
Course. At G.R. 535 904 there is a     
small children's play area with swings,
see-saw and goal post. At G.R. 532 902 
are the playing fields for the two     
schools. The {beach} is used by        
holiday-  makers in the summer and a   
well-used public {footpath} extends    
from Pakefield  Church along the cliff 
in a southerly direction.
