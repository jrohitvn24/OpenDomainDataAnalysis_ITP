		<title>03Landscape In Brigmerston.</title>
		<content>{   Brigmerston}is a very small village
 in {Wiltshire}and is less than one    
 kilometre long.Its lanes are very     
 narrow without pavements.Trees are    
 scattered along the hedgerow.There    
 are lots of wild flowers like         
 Primroses,Wild Daisies,Cow Parsley,   
 Stinging Nettles and Bluebells.A few  
 bunches of Wild Onion can be found    
 there.                                
   {Housing}is quite varied dating from
 the late eighteenth century to present
 day.The older houses used to have     
 thatched roofs and huge fireplaces    
 with dome shaped ovens made out of    
 flint.In one 200 year old cottage the 
 most interesting room was{The Sitting 
{Room}because of its ceiling.It was    
 2.35 metres high.
