		<title>18THE PRISON IN STARTFORTH</title>
		<content> The army left the town about 15 years 
 ago bringing a drastic reduction in   
 population and jobs and changing the  
 town's character.Only Barford Camp    
 still remains,two others have reverted
 to farmland and Deerbolt became a     
 Borstol,Streatlam,the Borstal farm.The
 Officers'quarters house Borstal staff 
 and married quarters were taken by the
 Council.The Borstal,now known as the  
 Youth Custody Centre in Startforth ,  
 overlooks the castle and the River    
 Tees.It's site was once an army camp. 
 When the army left,the Home Office    
 took over the camp to house young     
 offenders while they built themselves 
 a new Borstol.The Borstal opened in   
 1973.Tradesmen were employed to help  
 the boys.The work was delayed for a   
 year while the site was cleared of    
 bombs.In 1983 private builders had to 
 finish the work.                      </content>
