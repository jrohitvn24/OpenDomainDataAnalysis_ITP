		<content> In 1985 there are many popular games. 
 A big favourite is a game called      
 football. In this game there are two  
 teams, each with eleven players. To   
 give you a rough outline I will tell  
 you the basic rules. You are not      
 allowed to touch the ball with your   
 hands but you may touch it with your  
 feet, head, legs, chest and stomach.  
 The aim of the game is to score a goal
 by kicking the ball in a rectangular  
 frame. The team with the most points  
 after 90 minutes wins the match.      
 Football is usually played by boys.
