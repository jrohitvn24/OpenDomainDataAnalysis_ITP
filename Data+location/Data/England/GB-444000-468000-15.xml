		<title>15PLANT ON THE RASKELF ROAD</title>
		<content>{Mr Peacock started the plant hire     
{business in 1968. He decided on this  
{occupation because it was the next    
{best thing to farming. Also he had    
{only a small amount of capital; at    
{that time he was in partnership with  
{his brother.                          
{  They started with one JCB that cost 
{28 shillings (Â£1.40)an hour to hire.  
{Their busiest time of the year is     
{April to August but it also depends   
{on the weather.                       
{  The business is not worth as much as
{it was five years ago. Also they used 
{to employ seven or eight workers but  
{now they employ only three.           
{  Today jobs take the same time as    
{they did five years ago because       
{machines have not changed at all      
{except from the driver's point of view
{(more comfort in the cab). Mr Peacock 
{says "no way" to expanding the firm. }</content>
