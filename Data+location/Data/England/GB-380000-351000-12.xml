		<title>12Jamage Industrial Estate</title>
		<content>The Jamage Industrial Estate was built 
on land where the old Jamage Colliery  
used to be.The council built a round   
the area and then Normid Cooperative   
Society built a giant hypermarket store
there.Since then two other shops have  
op  pened;"Queensway"which sells       
furniture and"B+Q"which sells gardening
aquipment and DIY aquipment "B+Q" used 
to be called "Dodge City".             
     There are also factories and      
warehouses on the Jamage Industrial    
Estate.There are the Michelin Tyre     
Company,Walkers Century Oils,Archer    
Woodnut(a engernering ferm)and Oil     
Comparny.                              
   Recently some old pit tips have     
been levelled off and more factories   
 are going to be built.Many local peopl
have objected to this as they don't    
want more factories near to their      
homes.                                 </content>
