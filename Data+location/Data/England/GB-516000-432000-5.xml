		<title>05SPROATLEY VILLAGE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Sproatley village church is probably  
 one the oldest buildings in the area. 
 There are 10 bells in the church but  
 two are broken,there are also 2 church
 organs in the present church which is 
 99 years old.                         
 The Vicar at Sproatley Church is      
 called Reverend Baker and he conducts 
 services on a sunday in the church.   
 He also does marriage,funerals and    
 christenings when they are needed in  
 the village.                          
 Rev.Baker actually lives in Preston,  
 another village about 3 miles from the
 church and he sometimes goes to       
 Preston church as well as Sproatley.  
 The church used to be almost in the   
 middle of the village but with the new
 estate having been built the church is
 now at the south-east corner of the   
 village.
