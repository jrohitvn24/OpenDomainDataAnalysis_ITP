		<content> This reflects the major changes in the
community.Up to the 1950,and boosted by
the coming of Justin Brook Fruit Farms 
ithe 1930s,most of the community were  
employed on the land or in local       
"service" industries.After World War 2 
and with the coming of electricity and 
water,development was rapid.Road       
improvements,cheaper motoring both     
meant residents could work in the towns
and have wider choice for their needs. 
The result is only 1 local shop and few
local services.The villagers arrive    
prepared to travel to work in towns.   
Farming today is highly mechanized so  
far fewer men are needed.One farm with 
226.3 hectares now only employes 3 men.
There is some seasonal work on a casual
basis but only a small proportion of   
the total work force can be employed in
the village.Most of this work is on the
fruit farms.                           </content>
