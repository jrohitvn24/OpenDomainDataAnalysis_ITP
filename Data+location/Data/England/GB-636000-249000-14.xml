There are no shops around Butley so the
people go to Ipswich and Woodbridge for
consumer durables. A mobile grocer     
comes round twice a week. He sells     
things like sweets, cakes, biscuits,   
bread, drinks and fruit.               
A milkman comes round five times a     
week and he also sells fizzy drinks,   
butter, bread, bacon and sausages.     
The baker calls twice weekly and he    
also brings green-groceries. On Friday 
a fish'n'chip van comes. Wet fish is   
delivered on a Tuesday.                
The butcher's van comes around twice   
a week. A hardware van arrives once    
a fortnight, he sells paraffin. Yet    
another van sells shirts,              
sheets, carpets, cleaning materials    
and fancy goods. This trader comes two 
or three times a year. These mobile    
shops are useful in this rural area.   </content>
