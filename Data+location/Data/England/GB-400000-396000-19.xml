		<content> Although popular at all times of the  
 year, the Warden is able to assist    
 teachers in schools. Talks, slide     
 shows, demonstrations are given in    
 primary and secondary schools linked  
 with various aspects of environmental 
 work. A few small farm animals can be 
 brought to a school for a talk about  
 their use and care and to give the    
 children an opportunity to handle     
 them.                                 
 Topics can include:                   
 1 seasons - talk with slides, etc.    
 2 simple spinning                     
 3 butter making
