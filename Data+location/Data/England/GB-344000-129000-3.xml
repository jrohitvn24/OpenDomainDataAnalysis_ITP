		<content> The buildings in this area are mainly 
 old farms with rooves of pan-tiles or 
 "Double Romans", although there are a 
 few post-war residential buildings    
 scattered throughout the block.  To   
 the North-East there are several new  
 bungalows, on the{outskirts of Dundon,
 which are presumably residences for   
 people working in Street or           
 Glastonbury. {Somerton Door Farm}is   
 typical of the farms in this area in  
 that old farm buildings cluster around
 the original farmhouse but they have  
 been supplemented by very modern large
 barns of corrugated iron.  In addition
 a bungalow has recently been built on 
 the farm. At{Park}there are two old   
 farms whose buildings have been       
 supplemented by breeze block          
 constructions and even two rusted-out 
 Missen huts! Decoy Farm to the north  
 is a deserted ruin                    </content>
