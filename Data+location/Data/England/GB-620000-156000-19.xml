		<content> The following are some of the topics  
 which have interested us recently. The
 siting of the local radio mast caused 
 great controversy, it eventually      
 settled in Littlebourne. The blocking 
 of right of way by the mill wheel     
 Wickhambreux has caused much feeling  
 and the whole village has united to   
 have it restored. In L'bourne the loss
 of the VILLAGE POUND by its being sold
 to developers for building was very   
 much depracated, the village is much  
 poorer visually + historically because
 of it. The fate of the 12th C Barn    
 still hangs in the balance. In Ickham 
 the periodic flooding due to the      
 removal of the field hedges + the     
 leaky state of the village pond are   
 topical.Traffic is a special nuisance,

 creating noise and dust. The large TIR
 lorries hurtle along narrow roads     </content>
