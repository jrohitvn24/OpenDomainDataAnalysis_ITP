		<title>08A DAY IN A SCHOOLGIRL'S LIFE</title>
		<content>           AFTERNOON                   
    At 1315 lessons start again. On    
 Tuesdays we learn different crafts    
 until 1430. Then it is playtime again 
 for 15 minutes. The last hour of this 
 day is spent on Games, which may be   
 athletics or various ball games such  
 as tennis, football, netball, cricket,
 basketball, junior hockey or rugby,   
 depending on the time of year.        
    After school I stay to Gymnastics  
 Club before going home.Every other    
 week Amanda comes to my house before  
 we go to Youth Club.We have a         
 cooked meal in the early evening. If  
 there is nothing else to do, we might 
 go swimming in an outdoor pool when   
 the weather is warm.                  
    At 2100 hours I go home, get ready 
 for bed and read a book for a while   
 before going to sleep.
