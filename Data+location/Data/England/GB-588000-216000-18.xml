 As can be seen the population         
 increased dramatically from 1961_1976.
  This was due to many houses being    
 built at a reasonable price.          
  From the area it is easy to commute  
 to London via the British Rail station
 at Kelvedon,two and a half miles away;
 Ipswich,Colchester,Chelmsford and     
 London via the A12 major trunk road.  
                                       
 HOUSING                               
                                       
  In 1985 the average price of a three 
 bedroomed semi_detached house in      
 Tiptree is about Â£35,000, a detached  
 four bedroomed house on an estate     
 about Â£45,000_Â£50,000 and a large     
 detached house in the surrounding     
 countryside would be about            
 Â£80,000_Â£100,000.                     </content>
