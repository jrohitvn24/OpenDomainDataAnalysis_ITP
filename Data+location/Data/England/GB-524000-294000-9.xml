		<title>09A large agricultural farm 3</title>
		<content>   We pull the farm implements with a  
 tractor.  We cultivate the land with  
 cultivators (various) and ploughs.    
 We sow the grain with a drill.        
   I sometimes help my dad to irrigate 
 the potatoe fields. The irrigator is a
 long length of piping with wheels.  It
 has a motor to help it move.  After it
 has watered one section of the field, 
 my dad operates the motor to move it  
 so the other parts of the field get   
 watered.  The water is pumped from the
 dykes and carried in pipes to the     
 irrigator.  The jet of water travels  
 about 20 metres.                      
   The house I live in is owned by the 
 farm. The farm is over 1000 acres.    
 This isn't the biggest fen farm some  
 are over 3000 acres.                  
   If my father stopped working for the
 farm we would have to move house.
