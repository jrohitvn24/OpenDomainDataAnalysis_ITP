		<title>07Farnham Fire Service</title>
		<content> The information below was taken from  
 an interview with a local fireman.    
 The busiest time of year is spring as 
 dead bracken is still dry and because 
 of cold nights there are still chimney
 fires.The most common type of call is 
 small fires,grass and common fires.The
 least common is getting horses out of 
 swimming pools.After qualifying as a  
 fireman,men have to do practical      
 drills  on every shift.They also have 
 to do breathing apparatus training    
 twice a year in heat and smoke in the 
 fire house at Brigade Training School.
 About one third of the 5OO calls      
 attended by Farnham are things other  
 than fires.The firemen also have to   
 deal with road accidents,people locked
 out of their houses and animals       
 trapped.
