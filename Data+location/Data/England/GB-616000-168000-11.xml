		<title>11SHOPPING CHANGES IN HERNEBAY</title>
		<content> Ii 1985 shopping is no longer a       
 leisurely social occasion as groceries
 tend to be bought in bulk from the    
 large store and kept in a freezer if  
 necessary. Specialist shops e.g. for  
 fishing tackle are not threatened by  
 the big stores and another growth area
 for the small family shop is in the   
 Take Away food line . One area        
 of the retail trade in which there    
 have been sweeping changes in recent  
 years has been in the buying of food. 
 To cater for the families with home   
 freezers and which buy in bulk large  
 superstores have opened in the area   
 and the smaller grocery shops find it 
 very hard to compete with their prices
 or the range of products. In recent   
 years both Cullens and Liptons, old   
 established grocery shops have both   
 closed in this area.
