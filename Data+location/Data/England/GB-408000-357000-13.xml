     Many tourists come to walk on the 
Manifold Valley Track which runs from  
Hulme End to Waterhouses, a distance   
of about 8 miles.  It was first built  
for the Leek and Manifold Light        
Railway which opened in 1904 and       
closed because of lack of money in     
1934.  It was a 30 inch narrow gauge   
line and carried mainly milk and       
tourists.                              
                                       
     In 1984, to commemorate 80 years  
of the railway being opened and 50     
years of it being closed, they had a   
miniature train put on the track at    
Hulme End one weekend and it took      
passengers about a quarter of a mile   
down the track and back.  It did very  
well so they repeated the idea this    
year with a longer track and for two   
weekends.                              </content>
