 MOST PEOPLE HAVE A FAVOURITE FOOD,    
 MINE IS CHINESE AND INDIAN THINGS.    
 ENTERTAINMENT IS ALSO IMPORTANT.  IN  
 MY HOUSE IT IS THE COMPUTER, T.V. AND 
 VIDEO.   I LIKE LIVING HERE BECAUSE   
 ALL MY FRIENDS LIVE HERE."  MOST      
 PEOPLE OWN A TELEVISION SET AND MANY  
 HAVE VIDEO TAPE RECORDERS AND         
 COMPUTERS.   THEY GO AWAY ON HOLIDAY  
 AS A FAMILY ONCE EACH YEAR AND TAKE   
 DAY TRIPS ONCE OR TWICE EACH WEEK     
 IN THE SUMMER.  THE PARENTS EAT OUT   
 QUITE OFTEN AND THEY DO THEIR SHOPPING
 ONCE A WEEK AT THE LOCAL HYPERMARKET. 
 THE CHILDREN DO NOT WORK BUT THEY ARE 
 EXPECTED TO HELP WITH THE JOBS AROUND 
 THE HOUSE ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM ADMIT 
 TO DOING VERY LITTLE TO EARN THE      
 POCKET MONEY WHICH THEY GET EACH WEEK 
 TO BUY THINGS WITH.                   
                                       </content>
