		<title>14A DAY IN MY LIFE 4</title>
		<content>   It was one of those days in my life 
 when i could'nt be bothered to get up.
 My mam had to call me about 10 times. 
 I got out of bed . Then i got washed  
 and went down stairs and had my       
 breakfast. After that i just layed on 
 the sofa. Then at 8a.m my mam told me 
 off for being lazy. I got up and      
 started to get dressed, i wore my blue
 skirt with my white blouse. At half   
 past eight Julie came to our house.   
 She said that we were doing the       
 Domesday project at school. At 8.40 we
 left our house, and on the way I met  
 Fiona. When we got to school Mr.      
 Pearson, our teacher, told us to get  
 our reading books out, which was      
 boring.                               
    After that we did our Friday test, 
 which I scored 40 out of 50 on.
