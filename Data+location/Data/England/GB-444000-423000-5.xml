		<title>05Miners Strike in Ferrybridge</title>
		<content> When my dad was on strike if I needed 
 clothes badly my mum said "Sorry but  
 we can't afford it".I hated it in     
 winter,we only had 2 or 3 bags of coal
 to last for 2 weeks.We only lit a fire
 in the room at night.I had to have 3  
 or 4 extra covers on in bed.Dad made  
 dolls houses to sell for Christmas    
 presents.Every day when I came home   
 from school I was tired hearing about 
 the strike.My mum &amp; dad talked about  
 nothing else 24 hours a day.          
                                       
 The strike didn't really effect us in 
 our house.I still got pocket money.But
 there was a feeling just to have lived
 in Ferrybridge,to have witnessed all  
 the awful things.We knew Joe Green,he 
 promised me a Scottish pound note.He  
 was killed by a lorry doing his job as
 a picket at the power station.
