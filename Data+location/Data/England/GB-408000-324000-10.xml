		<content> St.Mary's and St.Anne's are private   
 schools.They were originally two      
 seperate schools ,one for the rich and
 one for the poor.They were joined     
 together in 1892. The founder of      
 St.Annes was Canon Lowe.The children  
 come from all parts of the world and  
 start at te age of eight and leave    
 when they are eighteen.               
 They all wear a school uniform which  
 is blue and during the winter they are
 allowed to wear a cape which is black 
 with a red inside.                    
 The school employs a lot of the       
 village people to carry out the       
 running of the school. People are     
 employed as cooks,cleaners,gardeners, 
 and matrons to look after the children
 who board at the school.
