		<title>01WELCOME TO EDENBRIDGE</title>
		<content>    Edenbridge is a small market town  
 situated in the heart of a farming    
 belt about 30 miles from London. The  
 population at present is about eight  
 thousand. Many of the residents       
 commute to London, but there is also a
 large industrial estate employing a   
 great many adults. The actual         
 population increased greatly in the   
 early 1960's when a council estate,   
 Spitals Cross, was built to house     
 residents moving down from London.    
    The town centre is full of         
 character mainly because the buildings
 appear to have been thrown together   
 with little thought of planning or    
 architectural style. The shops are    
 concentrated in a ribbon development  
 of about 300 metres.                  
    Clubs and sports are well supported
 in the town paricularly since the     
 opening of the Leisure Centre in 1984.</content>
