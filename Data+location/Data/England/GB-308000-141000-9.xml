		<content>    The{Village of West Quantoxhead}is 
 often known as{St. Audries.} West     
 Quantoxhead is obviously referring to 
 its{geographical location.}Its other  
 name seems to derive from the         
 dedication of the Church. The Church  
 is that of{St. Ethelreda}who,was      
 apparently, also known as St. Audrey. 
    John Norton, the{Victorian         
{architect,}avoided most of the pseudo 
 Gothic pitfalls so beloved of many of 
 his contemporaries when he rebuilt the
 Church in the 1850's.                 
    The{original Church}had become     
 quite beyond repair during the        
 nineteenth century.  The only things  
 that could be{salvaged}were two of the
{bells}that date back to the Fifteenth 
 Century and the{Norman Font.} In      
 addition the{fifteenth century screen 
 was saved and in l930 was erected in  
 Exford Church.                        </content>
