		<title>19WOODINGDEAN'S BEAT POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>    The local beat policeman for       
 Woodingdean has lived in              
 Woodingdean for eight years and has   
 been on the beat for over three       
 years.He walks about five miles per   
 day dealing with burglaries,vandalism 
 and just talking to people. He does   
 not have a set route. Most of the time
 he spends in Woodingdean but he also  
 looks after Ovingdean and the         
 grassland area Westwards.In his time  
 our policeman thinks that Woodingdean 
 has changed for the better. He feels  
 that the beat policeman is able to    
 prevent a lot of crime just by walking
 around. Over the years he has noticed 
 Woodingdean become a dormitory village
 with people commuting out of the area 
 to work.He states that there is no    
 such thing as an average day for a    
 policeman.
