		<content> They were built here as it provided   
 solid foundations on the sandstone    
 rock in 1964 with the 120ft Tower     
 added in 1974. It is all run by SERC  
 and costs about Â£30m each year, the   
 average wage is Â£13,000. The tower    
 contains a 22m volt Tandem Van Der    
 Graaff Generator used by research     
 establishments. It is used for studies
 on the neucleus of the atom in        
 medecine, engineering, archaeology,   
 nuclear science and the origins of the
 universe. The centre is in operation  
 all day and every day except for      
 maintenance checks. There is an       
 automatic cut off system. The local   
 people think the lab. is dangerous but
 are being constantly reassured. At the
 base of the tower stands the computer 
 room to control the larger experiments
 and 150 smaller ones scattered around 
 the site.                             </content>
