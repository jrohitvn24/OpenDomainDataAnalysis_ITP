		<title>09HOMES IN CRANTOCK &amp; PENTIRE</title>
		<content> There are a lot of old houses in{     
{Crantock}which have very old style    
 window frames. The houses are often   
 close together, and people have lived 
 here for over 1200 years. There are   
 few modern houses, no very big hotels,
 but there are some small hotels. Just 
 outside the village there is an inn   
 called "The Bowgie", which in Cornish 
 means "Cow Shed".  {Pentire}housing is
 mainly modern and expensive.  A large 
 new housing estate is still being     
 built.  Most buildings are hotels,    
 guest houses or have been turned into 
 flats.  Some people live in bungalows 
 which are often luxurious.  Many      
 of the houses enjoy wonderful views   
 over the Gannel Estuary and Crantock  
 Bay. There are very few shops near the
 houses on Pentire, so people shop in  
 Newquay.
