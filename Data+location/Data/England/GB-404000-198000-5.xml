		<title>05SOUTH CERNEY ARMY CAMP(CONT)</title>
		<content> We where shown around the camp by the 
 Adjutant, Captain Mike Rees, whose    
 photograph is included with this      
 survey. He was 21 years old when he   
 came to South Cerney, and has enjoyed 
 his time here, as his work is         
 exciting, different and busy. His     
 hobby is shooting on Military ranges, 
 where he has a variety of weapons. We 
 also met the Leiutenant Colonel in the
 No2 Postal and Courier detachment of  
 the Royal Engineers. They played an   
 important role in the Falklands War,  
 when they transported a massive amount
 of forces mail to and from the South  
 Atlantic.
