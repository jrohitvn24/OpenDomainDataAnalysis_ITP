 in this area only 3 lived alone, 2 of 
 whom were senior citizens,both having 
 lived in the district for many years, 
 the other moved from Birmingham 2     
 years ago. Other senior citizens were

 houses or living with their adult     
 married children,most of whom had not 
 lived here for more than a few years. 
 There were 2 couples and 5 single

 families and in most cases the younger
 parents were working. Of the families 
 with children,the average was 2 of

 2 of whom did not live at home,1      
 family with a baby and 1 where a first
 baby was expeced.
