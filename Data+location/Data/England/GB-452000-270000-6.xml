		<title>06The Arnold Arms</title>
		<content>   The Arnold Arms is in Barby. Behind 
 the Pub there are some Zebra Finches, 
 Chinese Quails and a few canaries.    
 Also in the garden there are two      
 swings and a rocking horse.           
   There were five Pubs in Barby but   
 this is the only one left. The Pub was
 and is the focal point of the village 
 being a meeting place for the Cricket,
 Football and other clubs.             
   There is a lounge, a meeting room   
 and the Public Bar that has a Dart    
 Board, a Skittles Table and a Pool    
 Table. There are Ladies' and Mens'    
 teams for Skittles and Darts.         
   In the Winter there is a proper     
 fire. When we visited the Landlord we 
 think we may have woken him up but he 
 was very kind to us and knew a lot    
 about Barby in the old days. We were  
 invited in even though it was only    
 nine o'clock in the morning.          </content>
