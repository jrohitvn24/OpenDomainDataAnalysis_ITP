		<content>  The other precinct is{Marston,}much  
 smaller than{Headington,}but it       
 contains many facilities such as a    
 hairdresser's, a furniture store, a   
 video hire shop and a veterinary      
 surgeon. The general opinion is that  
 you can live quite comfortably in     
 Marston, but if you want luxuries,    
 you must look elsewhere.              
  Some people said they would like to  
 see a{wet fish shop,}and one thought  
 another{chemist}would be a good idea, 
 but most people thought the facilities
 in Marston were good enough already.  
  There are also a few shops by the    
{Green-Road Roundabout.}Here you will  
 find another hairdresser's, a post    
 office, a laundrette, a newsagents and
 a model shop. In our area there are 5 
 garages. The area has a wide range of 
 shops, which are perfectly adequate   
 for whatever it is you need.          </content>
