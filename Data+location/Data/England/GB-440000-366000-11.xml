		<title>11TEMPLE NORMANTON SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Temple Normanton is a small village   
 with an equally small school. On roll 
 are only 35 children who come from a  
 wide catchment area. The children are 
 divided into two classes. The infant  
 children share a room and the juniors 
 another. So in each class there is a  
 wide spread of age and ability.       
 The small number of children allows   
 the staff to develop an informal      
 approach and a happy working relation-
 ship is achieved.                     
 However, the small number of pupils   
 means that sport and other competetive
 activities are restricted. Developing 
 music in the school is a problem.     
 Concerts are limited. Even choosing a 
 book to read to the class is difficult
 for the teacher.                      
 The small village school is attractive
 and spacious with its own hall, dining
 room, canteen and spare classrooms.   </content>
