 MILLOM IS IN CUMBRIA. AT THIS MOMENT  
 100 YEARS AGO A MINER WOULD BE GETTING
 OUT OF BED WHILE ANOTHER MINER WOULD  
 GET IN HIS PLACE.MILLOM USED TO BE    
 KNOWN FOR ITS ORE AND IRON MINING. WE 
 HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE SEA WALL.    
 THERE USED TO BE TWO SEA WALLS, ONE   
 COLLAPSED WHEN THEY MINED UNDERNEATH  
 AND THE PUMPING WENT ON STRIKE. YOU   
 CAN STILL SEE THE PART OF THE OLD SEA 
 WALL AND YOU CAN STILL SEE ALL OF THE 
 NEW ONE. IN BETWEEN THE SEA WALLS     
 THERE IS NOW A WATER SPORTS AREA. IT  
 BELONGS TO BLUE ANCHOR BUILDING SITE  
 AND HOLIDAY SITE. IN BETWEEN THE SEA  
 WALLS THERE ARE LOTS OF TREES
