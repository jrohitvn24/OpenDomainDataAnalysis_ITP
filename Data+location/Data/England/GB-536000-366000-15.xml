		<content>    The Franklin Secondary School is   
 named after Spilsby's most famous son;
 the discoverer of the North West      
 Passage. The School admitted its      
 first pupils on September 15th. 1953. 
    It was the first three storey      
 school to be built in Lindsey and at  
 that time comprised of assembly hall, 
 dining hall and the present block of  
 practical rooms.  The curriculum had a
 strong bias towards rural studies and 
 the arable section of the School farm 
 covered an area of 2.2 acres. This    
 site is now occupid by the Primary    
 School Annexe. The School hs been much
 altered and extended since then.      
    The School has always strived for  
 high standards of discipline and      
 courtesy as well as endeavouring to   
 fit the academic needs of the children
    With the advent of falling rolls   
 further changes are inevitable.       </content>
