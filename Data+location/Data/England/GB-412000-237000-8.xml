		<content> Society in this part of the Cotswolds 
 is undergoing a rapid change. Many    
 retired and well-to-do people have    
 come to the district thus the price of
 housing and building land has soared. 
 Young Campden people have been forced 
 to leave the town thus a "them and us"
 situation has been created. The local 
 people see this drain of their young  
 people and the alteration of the whole
 way of life in the town as a disaster,
 but feel powerless and resentful when 
 they see more speculative building    
 taking place.Many shops in Campden    
 which once provided a service to the  
 people now are more touristy and the  
 local person is obliged to shop in    
 nearby towns. Campden Society,formed  
 to look after the interests of the    
 town but is largely non-Campdonian in 
 membership. The local people see them 
 as paternalistic and will not join.   </content>
