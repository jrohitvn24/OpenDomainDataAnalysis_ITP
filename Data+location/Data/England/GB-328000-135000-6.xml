		<content> The Bridgwater Canal today is polluted
 with rubbish and green algae. Near    
 the canal, as it approaches the docks,
 are some quite large terraced houses  
 built with red bricks and tiles made  
 in Bridgwater when brick and tile     
 making were major industries          
 (industries that continued until the  
 late 1960s.)  The hedges bordering    
 the canal provides homes for birds    
 and the banks for water voles. In the 
 canal are eels, pike, tench and rudd. 
 Angling and canoeing are two popular  
 recreations. It is planned to restore 
 the canal so that more light boats    
 can be used on it. Alongside the      
 canal, near the red bricked terraced  
 houses, are allotments on which are   
 grown potatoes,carrots,beans, lettuce 
 and other vegetables. At quiet times  
 of the day it is sometimes possible   
 to see a heron or a kingfisher.       </content>
