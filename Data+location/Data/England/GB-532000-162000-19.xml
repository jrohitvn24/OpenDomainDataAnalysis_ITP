		<title>19TRAFFIC SURVEY _S.CROYDON</title>
		<content> We went to count the traffic on the   
 Brighton Road between 8.15. and       
 9.15.a.m.There were 500 cars bumper to
 bumper,going either to Purley(south)  
 or Croydon(north) at a slow pace.The  
 people going to Croydon,we thought,   
 were going to offices or shops.Those  
 going south we thought were heading   
 for Coulsdon,Gatwick or possibly      
 Brighton.We expected more cars because
 of the rain.we were surprised that    
 there were less buses in the morning  
 than in the afternoon.We thought that 
 the trucks were delivering goods.     
 In the afternoon survey we counted 250
 cars going in both directions in a    
 steady stream.We thought they had had 
 a lunch break,were part_time workers  
 or mums doing shopping or visiting.
