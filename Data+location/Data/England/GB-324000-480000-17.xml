		<title>17CONISHEAD PRIORY</title>
		<content>   This spectacular building started   
 life in the 12th century when Gamel de
 Pennington found that the site was the
 safest in the area to make landings   
 from the sea.                         
   In 1821 the Gothic mansion that     
 stands today was built,its towers and 
 battlements retaining the style of the
 earlier building. The interior has    
 fine decorative plaster ceilings and  
 wood panelling.                       
   The Priory is now the home of a     
 religious order,the ORDER OF TIBETAN  
 MAHAYANA BUDDHIST SCHOOL,whose monks  
 are gradually restoring the building  
 to its former splendours.             
   Open to the public many afternoons, 
 the Priory has a cafe and craft shop  
 and offers weekend and one day        
 seminars in a variety of subjects.
