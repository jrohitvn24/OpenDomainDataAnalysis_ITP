		<content>   The{hay}in the fields we rent had   
 been cut and baled so today, Saturday,
 we had to bring it home. I fed my pony
 and put her out to graze and then I   
 fed my mum's goats as well as the     
 ducks and chicks.                     
   After breakfast dad started the     
 tractor and attached the trailer      
 then we all climbed on to have a ride.
 We started stacking. The heat was     
 scorching. My sister and I rolled the 
 bales closer to the trailer while dad 
 threw them up to mum at the top of the
 stack.                                
   We had sandwiches for lunch and in  
 the afternoon it cooled down with a   
 wind blowing. At 3.45pm. the work was 
 finished. We all went indoors to rest 
 and we hungrily munched the feast of  
 goodies that mum had laid on the      
 table. I'm glad we only make hay once 
 a year!                               </content>
