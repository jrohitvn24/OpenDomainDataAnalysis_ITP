 Washton village is a very peaceful    
place. The only road through the       
village is a dead end. The houses are a
mixture of styles; most are old such as
Keld Cottage where the windows were    
blocked up in the 18th century to avoid
paying tax.                            
 There is not much to do in the village
apart from drinking in the pub or      
playing quoits on the village green.   
The green was used as the site for     
village celebrations such as May Day   
and local fetes.                       
 In 1982 Washton won an award as the   
best kept village in the area.         
 There are about 20 dwellings in       
Washton two of them are farms.
