		<content> This block is a sparsely populated    
 rural area, consisting of a mixture of
 farmland and semi-natural vegetation. 
 It includes the edge of Mullion       
 village. Tourism and farming form the 
 basis of the local economy. Tourists  
 are attracted by the natural beauty   
 and the proximity of the sea. Mixed   
 farming is practised_ fodder crops,   
 early vegetables and flowers are      
 grown; cattle are kept for milk and   
 beef.                                 
 A mulberry tree,still growing in the  
 grounds of Bochym Manor, is mentioned 
 in the Domesday Book. The Manor now   
 caters for tourists. Holiday          
 accommodation is found in the block,  
 mainly camp sites, self-catering      
 cottages and farmhouse bed and        
 breakfasts.                           
 Unemployment is high, particularly in 
 the winter when tourists are absent.  </content>
