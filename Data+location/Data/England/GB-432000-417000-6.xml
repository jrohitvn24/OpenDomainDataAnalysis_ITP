		<content> Quite near to our school is a new {   
{Asda Superstore.                      
 Asda is a trade name. It stands for   
 Associated Dairies. The store has been
 built outside the town and the new    
 Asdale Road has been built specially  
 for traffic to get to it.             
 Asda employs a lot of people and most 
 of them are women, but a lot of men   
 work in the warehouse. Thirty-three   
 children in Kettlethorpe Middle School
 have relatives working there. There is
 a very{large car park}and customers   
 come from a large area. A special     
 entrance has been made for {buses}and 
 the bus services in the area have been
 changed so that they all stop at the  
 store.                                
 When cars go in and out they pass a { 
{petrol filling station}with
