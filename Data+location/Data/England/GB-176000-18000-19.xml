		<content> I am eleven years old. My grandparents
 and parents are hoteliers, and own a  
 hotel. My parents, my brother and I   
 live in a bungalow in the grounds of  
 the hotel. I like to help in the      
 hotel. My day starts at 7.45, when I  
 wash, dress and have my breakfast in  
 the kitchen before going to the hotel 
 for my first job, washing up from the 
 night before. I go back to the        
 bungalow to feed and let out the      
 chickens. Then I prepare my packed    
 lunch before cycling to school. When  
 school has finished I cycle home and  
 spend some free time riding my pony   
 for an hour and a half. My evening    
 work is preparing the morning trays   
 for the guests in the hotel. I set out
 the trays with cups, saucers, milk,   
 sugar, tea, dried milk and a kettle. I
 leave the trays outside the doors of  
 the guest rooms.                      </content>
