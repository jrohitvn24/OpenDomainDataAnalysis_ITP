		<title>02ASHWELLTHORPE'S DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content>{Ashwellthorpe}has been allowed to grow
 over the last 2 decades with an       
 enlivening influx of mobile urban new-
 comers who have altered &amp; revitalised 
 the static structure of a remote rural
 community.The social ease which this  
 has generated is in sharp contrast to 
 a feudal village which until 1918 had 
 been dominated for centuries &amp; prac-  
 tically owned by the occupants of Ash-
 wellthorpe Hall.Very few babies were  
 born in the 1950s.Some 80 children now
 attend schools outside the village.   
{Every year Father Xmas comes from Fun-
{denhall in a spellbinding fairy-tale  
{cart trimmed with lights &amp; drawn by a 
{white pony.He gives chocolate to      
{children waiting in the darkness all  
{along The Street.}In 1977 more than   
 250 parishioners gathered on the green
 in front of the church for a Jubilee  
 photograph.                           </content>
