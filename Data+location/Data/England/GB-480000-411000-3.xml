		<content> During the day wildlife can be seen on
 the fields e.g. rabbits,hares,wild    
 ducks,moorhens,partridges and         
 pheasants.                            
    The area is criss-crossed by many  
 tracks,some of which are maintained by
 the Board,others by farmers themselves
 being infilled with rubble from       
 demolished farmhouses.                
    In the village of Keadby the       
 housing consists mainly of terraces or
 semi-detached.Most of the residents   
 work elsewhere.                       
    Many anglers visit the village     
 during the coarse fishing season and  
 although there were pollution problems
 some years ago,good catches of        
 roach,bream,perch and eels can be had 
 from the canal and the three drains,  
 and angling matches are regularly     
 held.                                 
                                       </content>
