  There are two main roads passing     
 through the area - the A13 from east  
 to west and the M25 from north to     
 south.Part of the A13 is a new dual   
 carriageway opened in 1984, providing 
 a good road link from the M25 to the  
 refineries further east.(The old A13  
 has been redesignated the A1306).     
  The M25 is known as the London       
 Orbital Motorway and provides links   
 from here to the M11 and M1 going     
 north,to the M4 going west and the M2 
 and M20 going east to the Channel     
 Ports.This stretch was opened in 1984 
 and leads south to the A282 Dartford  
 Tunnel approach road which leads under
 the River Thames.
