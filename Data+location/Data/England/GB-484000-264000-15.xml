		<title>15 The New A45 Bypass at Wilby</title>
		<content>The villagers of Wilby hoped that the  
opening of the new road would reduce   
the noise &amp; fumes that have made life  
miserable for those who lived along the
main road.However heavy lorries going  
to &amp; from the Enterprise Zone were     
still thundering through the village   
especially in early morning &amp; early    
evening.Many drivers found it quicker  
to use the old route rather than the   
bypass.The residents complained to the 
local council that the noise was       
continuing &amp; a petition was signed by  
80% of the villagers calling for a     
lorry ban.It was then decided to impose
a weight restriction of 7.5 tonnes on  
lorries passing through the village in 
the hope that this will make the       
village a quieter &amp; less dangerous     
place in which to live.
