		<title>06Pendomer: Farming 2</title>
		<content> Nearly all the land is ploughed every 
 few years, and either sown with grass 
 or used for growing wheat (for sale)  
 or barley (for feeding stock). On the 
 cornbrash soils the grain crops are   
 particularly important. There is      
 little permanent pasture and virtually
 no unimproved grassland. Both silage  
 and hay are made, and the larger farms
 have their own dairies, grain stores, 
 and combines, while the smaller farms 
 may share these. On several farms, and
 on some other parcels of land which   
 are no longer working farms, a few    
 horses are kept. Hunting is a popular 
 pursuit in the area - viewed with     
 predictably mixed feelings by farmers!
 Some of them enjoy hunting; others    
 regard it as a nuisance, apt to damage
 hedges and drive foxes into the farm- 
 yards and chicken runs. It does little
 to control the foxes.                 </content>
