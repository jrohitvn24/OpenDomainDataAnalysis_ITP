		<title>05CORNBURY DEER PARK</title>
		<content> The {Cornbury Deer Park} was begun in 
 the reign of {Queen Anne. }The Park   
 contains some very old trees, notably 
 single {Oaks, Lime avenues planted l50
{yrs ago and Beech avenues 250yrs old.}
 2/3rds of the Beech were dangerous -  
 some plugged with concrete to preserve
 them - and have been felled and re-   
 planted. All mature trees are browsed 
 to 6ft height by deer. {New trees }are
 protected by {6ft weldmesh tubes}. The
 traditional {Fallow} herd is kept at  
 c.{450 head, buck to doe ratio l to 6}
 to prevent undue aggression during    
 rut. {25 Formosan Sika Deer }were int-
 roduced from Woburn in l975; there are
 now {80}. They are tamer than Fallow. 
 An {8ft stone wall}keeps them inside. 
 In {Winter}they are fed {hay and min- 
{eral licks}to supplement the grazing. 
{Venison}from the {cull} is sold       
 through a gamedealer.                 </content>
