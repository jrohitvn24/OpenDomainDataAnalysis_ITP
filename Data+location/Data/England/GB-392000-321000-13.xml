		<title>13TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN STAFFORD</title>
		<content>The survey showed that 78.5% of our    
contributors travel by car,and most    
travel alone.Only 5% walk,and a similar
number use the bus.Almost as many use a
bicycle.The remainder go by motor cycle
or vary their method of transport.     
{EASING THE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS}          
1.More people should share cars,they   
would save petrol,save parking and     
space and it would be more friendly.   
2.People should be persuaded to use the
buses.Weekly tickets are quite cheap,  
and the mini buses are frequent.       
3.Encourage people to cycle to work,   
they would be much fitter.             
4.Many people work for the County      
Council.If their offices were in the   
suburbs the traffic would go in        
different directions.                  
5.A fly-over or underground railway    
would be good,but would be  expensive.
