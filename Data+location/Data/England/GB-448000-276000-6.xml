		<title>06Street names</title>
		<content> Today 24th May Anthony and I went to  
 the Glebe estate, to ask people about 
 their street. All the people we       
 visited were very friendly. We went to
 Fosterd RD, Norman RD, Quarry Close.  
 All the people we asked thought that  
 their roads were alright, and         
 everybody thought that where they were
 was very quite. When we asked about   
 their road names some said it was     
 unusual. At Norman RD they thought the
 name was alright but 1 did not care.  
 At Quarry Close 1 person said it was  
 appropriate because the Quarry is near
 to where she lives. Most people wanted
 improvements. At Fosterd RD they did  
 not want any improvements, at Norman  
 RD they wanted better kept            
 gardens,wider roads, at Quarry Close  
 they wanted some plants on the green.
