		<content>   In our area every household has a   
 television. A television is used to   
 watch programs on. Computers can be   
 linked up to televisions. Only three  
 families in this area own computers,  
 the rest either don't want one or can 
 not afford one.                       
                                       
   Forty-two families have record      
 players, every family has a radio.    
 Record players are used to play       
 records on, mainly music.             
                                       
   Six families in the area own C.B.   
 radios. These are two way radios which
 let people talk to each other even if 
 they are a long way away.
