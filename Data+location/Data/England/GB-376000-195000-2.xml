		<content> Stouts Hill School was a Preparatory  
 School for boys aged 8-13 years. It   
 was founded in 1933 and its most      
 famous ex-pupil must be Captain Mark  
 Phillips, husband of H.R.H.Princess   
 Anne. They live at nearby Gatcombe    
 Park.                                 
    The school closed down at Easter   
 1979 due to lack of pupils and the    
 building is now used as a Time-Sharing
 holiday complex.                      
    Facilities available to the        
 temporary residents include           
 horse-riding,tennis, croquet,         
 badminton, table tennis and snooker.  
 Two swimming pools, one indoor and one
 outdoor, and a sauna are part of the  
 scheme.
