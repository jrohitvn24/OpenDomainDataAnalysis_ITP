		<title>13BOUGHTON MONCHELSEA SCHOOL</title>
		<content> This Primary School was built in 1850 
 at a cost of Â£609. It consisted of the
 teacher's residence, now used as      
 office space, and "two rooms..with    
 accommodation for 75 boys and 75 girls
 allowing six square feet per child "; 
 these now form the school hall.       
 The school, a County Junior and Infant
 School, currently has 171 children in 
 six classes, with Headmaster and six  
 teaching staff. Its buildings and     
 facilities have increased, of course, 
 since 1850, an indoor heated swimming 
 pool being provided in 1963 by the    
 active Parent-Teacher Association.    
 Outside is a hard play area, football 
 pitch, adventure playground, outdoor  
 theatre, pond and woodland area.      
 Children come from a wide area, and   
 extra-curricular activities include   
 various music groups, as well as      
 games, Astronomy and French clubs.    </content>
