		<content> This page discusses the industrial    
 archaeology of the area.              
 The Victoria History of Somerset      
 mentions large and productive         
 woodlands in the parish in 1794.Small 
 scale tree felling continued into the 
 mid-20th cent.                        
 In the Greyfield area in the n.e. are 
 the remains of 18th and 19th cent.    
 coal workings.                        
 Quarrying has a long history,and it   
 has been suggested that 'Temple Cloud'
 means 'the quarry of the Knights      
 Templar'.The last working quarry      
 closed in 1939.The stone is Blue      
 Pennant,known locally as Temple Stone.
 At the beginning of the century clay  
 was mined (the workings extend under  
 the school),and used to make bricks   
 and tiles.A sawmill was later built on
 the site of the brickworks to exploit 
 Paulwood.It closed about 20 years ago.</content>
