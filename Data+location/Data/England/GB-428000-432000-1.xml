 SHOPPING AREAS ARE NEW UNDER COVER    
 PRECINCTS LIKE THE ST JOHN'S          
 CENTRE.OTHER SHOPPING AREAS ARE NOT   
 UNDER COVER BUT ARE NOT OPEN TO CARS  
 ETC. AROUND THE CENTRAL SHOPPING AREA 
 IS AN OLDER ZONE OF HOUSING SOME OF   
 WHICH HAS BEEN DONE UP BUT IN SOME    
 AREAS THE OLDER HOUSES HAVE BEEN      
 KNOCKED DOWN AND REPLACED BY TALL     
 BLOCKS OF FLATS,OR OTHER NEW HOUSING. 
 IN SOME AREAS THERE IS A CONCENTRATION
 OF INDUSTRY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO    
 ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AIRE AND 
 TO THE SOUTH OF THE CITY CENTRE.
