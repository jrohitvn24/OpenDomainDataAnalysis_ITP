		<title>10A CARLISLE SUBURB;MEMORIES</title>
		<content> With a penny you could buy 4 sweets.If
 you had sixpence you were rich.Behind 
 the shop were some cows and hens.     
 People weren't rich,but they got      
 plenty to eat.There was plenty of     
 market gardens and orchards,so there  
 was plenty of fruit and vegetables.   
 Gas lamps weren't introduced until    
 about 1928.Houses were dark and were  
 lit by candlelight or paraffin lamps. 
 Few people had a wireless and tele-   
 vision was not invented.People sailed 
 boats,fished and paddled in the stream
 at Beck Road.Houses were unlocked be- 
 cause nobody stole anything and every-
 body knew everybody.Acredale was the  
 end of Belle Vue.Green Lane was just  
 trees.Beaver Road,Crown Road,Beck Road
 and Criffel Road had very few houses  
 and were just lanes with an archway of
 trees over them.Games were Mutterkitty
 Hopscotch,Hide'n'seek and Top'n'whip. </content>
