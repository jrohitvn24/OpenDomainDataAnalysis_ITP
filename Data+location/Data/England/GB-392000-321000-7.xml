illnesses he treats.Talking to and with
patients is the way the doctor sorts   
out the problems.He helps about  1000  
patients a year.    He does not wear a 
uniform.Dr Cooper did 5 years training 
to be a medical doctor and a further 7 
years to become a psychiatrist.Drugs   
such as lithium,anti-depressants and   
tranquillisers are used for treating   
patients.Loss of memory in old people  
can be helped by taking vitamins.      
Occupational therapy helps to keep     
minds working.One person in ten will   
need psychiatric treatment during their
lifetime.                              </content>
