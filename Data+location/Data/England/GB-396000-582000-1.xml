		<content> Kirkwhelpington is a most atractive   
 village with views to the Wanney Crags
 nd over the Warsbeck valley. Heavy    
 main road traffic has been diverted   
 from the village. Buildings ar mostly 
 stone and gardens well kept. Hodgson, 
 the historian lived in the Rectory and
 recorded the area in 1830. Sir Charles
 Parsons is buried here. There were 2  
 mills, now disused. Farming is mainly 
 rearing sheep and catle, but some corn
 is grown. Trees inhabit valleys ad    
 provide shelter belts. Westwards means
 increasing remoteness and West        
 Whelpington, once with a tower and    
 houses, is now populated only by      
 rabbits and sheep. Quarrying has      
 removed about half the site, but it ws
 excavated in advance. Some of the     
 quarry buildings are used as a        
 carpentry shop and store, mainly for  
 gun racks used by sportsmen &amp; Army.   </content>
