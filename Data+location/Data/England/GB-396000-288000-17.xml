		<title>17MEDICAL CARE NEAR TIVIDALE</title>
		<content>  There is one general medical         
 practice, with four doctors in        
 partnership. The area is also served  
 by a neighbourhood clinic which cares 
 for children from the local junior    
 school. The clinic is involved with   
 foot-care, dental-care, and pre-natal 
 care. Some groups such as Mothers and 
 Toddlers and the Over 60's also meet  
 there.                                
  Periodically a nurse will visit the  
 junior school to look at hair, nails  
 and feet. She also does a thorough eye
 test.                                 
 Sometimes a doctor will visit the     
 school to give children a medical     
 examination and also a dentist will   
 visit to examine teeth.
