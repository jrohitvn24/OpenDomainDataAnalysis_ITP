PLAY GROUP/ MUMS AND TODDLERS.         
Children have to be two before they can
start at playgroup and they can stay   
there until they start school.  The    
children make things and play together.
The playgroup meets on three mornings a
week.  Some of the mothers help to run 
the group.  Before the children go to  
playgroup they can go with their       
mothers to the Mums and Toddlers group.
They play while the mothers talk and   
meet together.
