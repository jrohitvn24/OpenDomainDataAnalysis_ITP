		<title>04Forty Foot Picnic Site</title>
		<content> Situated on the boundary between      
 Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire at  
 Dungee Corner is Forty Foot Lane      
 Picnic site. This 4 acre site was     
 opened by Bedfordshire County Council 
 in 1976. There are several parking    
 spaces and four sets of picnic tables 
 and chairs and litter bins. This is a 
 very attractive and popular picnic    
 site,that has been visited by many    
 people from both sides of the county  
 boundary. Some people go to the picnic
 site, just to use the 'on-site'       
 facilities and others use it as a base
 for walking on the extensive public   
 right of way network in the area. The 
 site has attracted over 2,000 visitors
 during the last year- 1984/85.
