		<title>18CHURCHES IN PRESTON</title>
		<content> St.Martin's Church,Preston,was built  
 in 1899,when the Rev.B.N.Switzer first
 decided that Preston should have its  
 own church.In earlier times the       
 Minsden Chapel of St.Nicholas was used
 for both Preston and Langley but this 
 fell into disrepair in the 17th       
 century. It was used as a fashionable 
 place to be married,even as a ruin.In 
 1849 a dual purpose church_school     
 building was erected in School        
 Lane,this served the community until  
 St.Martin's Church was built.The      
 building is now demolished.Between    
 those dates we assume that the village
 met informally to worship,as there was
 a strong non_conformist element       
 locally.Some may have travelled to St.
 Mary's Hitchin, others may have atten_
 ded St. Ippolyt's Church or Kings     
 Walden.
