The landscape around Berkhamsted is a  
reflection of both natural and manmade 
features.The Berkhamted Valley runs    
from N.W.to S.E. cuttng through the    
Chiltern Hills, an area of chalk and   
clay. The valley is between 105m and   
180m above sea level.It is at the      
southernmost limit of glaciation and   
the smooth rounded form of the valley  
is evidence of the valley previously   
beng a glacial meltwater channel. This 
has resulted in alluvial soils being   
deposited in the valley with chalk,    
clay and flint  on the valley sides.   
50% of the block is   covered by urban 
development, being   comprised of      
industry, commerce and   housing. The  
S.W.side of the valley is   the more   
developed. The higher land,   to the   
N.E. and the S.W.is fine   undulating  
agricultural land with some woodland.  </content>
