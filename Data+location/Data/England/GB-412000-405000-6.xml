		<content> On May 22nd. we went to{Holme Moss    
{Radio Station.}It used to be a        
 television mast. The mast is very tall
 and balances on a big ball bearing.   
 Inside the station it is large even   
 though it looks small outside. It is  
 the only B.B.C.Station with revolving 
 doors. They have two big diesel       
 engines for if the electricity goes   
 off. They are so noisy you have to    
 wear ear muffs. They have three Range 
 Rovers for getting to "out stations". 
 They transmit radio programmes        
 including local radio and monitor     
 television programmes. It was cold and
 misty when we looked at the mast.     
  On sunny days{tourists}come to see   
 Nora Battye and Compo's houses and    
 watch the filming of "Last of the     
 Summer Wine" instead of seeing the    
 beautiful scenery, woodland and       
 reservoirs.                           </content>
