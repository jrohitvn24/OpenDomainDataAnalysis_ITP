		<title>08LEAVERS' EVENING IN G'M</title>
		<content> Every June the fourth years at the    
 primary school in Gilmorton have a    
 Leavers' Evening.This involves the    
 children who are leaving the school to
 go on to secondary education,their    
 parents and the staff of the          
 school.The school choir sings,the     
 children play their recorders and this
 year the children talked about their  
 week's field-trip to Scarborough.     
 Each child is presented with a book by
 the Rector of Gilmorton who is also   
 chairman of the school governors.The  
 evening finishes with coffee and      
 cakes.                                
 It is always a happy and interesting  
 occasion and provides a fitting ending
 to the children's career at their     
 primary school.
