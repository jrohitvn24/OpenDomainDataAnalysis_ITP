		<title>10STANBRIDGE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of Stanbridge is one small
 group of houses.It has a church and a 
 bus stop.Five worker's cottages are   
 tucked away between some large trees. 
  Most of Stanbridge is owned by       
 Mrs.Gibson of High Hall.Mrs.Gibson    
 owns about 500 acres of land.She has  
 two lodgers in High Hallwhere she has 
 lived for over 20 years.              
  The church in Stanbridge is called   
 St.Kenelm's and was closed three years
 ago because very few people came to   
 worship.It is built of flint stone.   
  The garage in Stanbridge has petrol  
 pumps and an M.O.T. bay.Cars do not   
 use the garage often,probably because 
 there are several garages in Wimborne 
 Minster.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
