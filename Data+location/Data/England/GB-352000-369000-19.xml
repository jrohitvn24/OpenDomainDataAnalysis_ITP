{LOCAL HISTORY CONTINUED               
 Eddisbury was also occupied in Roman  
 times. It made a good vantage point   
 between Chester &amp; Northwich.(There is 
 a photograph of it).                  
 The forest itself was a Royal hunting 
 forest &amp; the Normans called it forest 
 of the lakes. The first Norman Earl of
 Chester,Hugh Lupus(Hugh the Wolf) was 
 granted rights to hunt in it by       
 William the Conqueror. On Eddisbury   
 there was a Royal hunting lodge which 
 became known as the Chamber in the    
 Forest.It became delapidated in the   
 1800's although evidence of its       
 existence can still be seen today.    
 In 1812 the forest was deemed 'a place
 for growing trees'&amp; planting began in 
 1816. Prior to this forests had been  
 places for hunting.                   </content>
