		<content> My name is Elanor and I am ten years  
 old.  On school days I get up and have
 breakfast of cereal.  By 08.35 I am on
 my way to school.  When the whistle   
 goes at 08.55, we  go for Assembly.   
 Later we begin our Mathematics.  At   
 10.35 we have our playtime, after     
 which we do some English work.  Lunch 
 break is from 12.00 to 13.30 when we  
 get changed for Physical Education.   
 We then have a break followed by      
 Storytime.  School finishes at 15.45  
 when I go home, get changed and watch 
 my favourite television programme     
 called "Blue Peter".  I have my dinner
 of sausages and chips at 18.30 when my
 father returns from his work in       
 London.  After having a bath I get    
 ready for bed, where I read before    
 sleeping.
