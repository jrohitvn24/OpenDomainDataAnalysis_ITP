		<title>10MILL WORKERS, CALDER VALE</title>
		<content> Most of the people who work in the    
 Lappet Mill in Calder Vale enjoy their
 work. They also enjoy working with    
 their friends.                        
 The people we interviewed said that   
 they would not like to work anywhere  
 else. We asked some of the workers if 
 they would like to work on a different
 floor or job.  One said that they     
 would like to work in the office but  
 all the others said no.               
 Most of them have worked there 20 to  
 40 years.                             
 We also asked them if most people came
 from outside and they do, from        
 Garstang and Preston.                 
 Most of the people that work on the   
 top floor are from Calder Vale. They  
 all said it was quite hot and dusty,  
 especially in the summer when it is   
 about 80 degrees in there.
