		<title>15LAW AND ORDER IN BOXFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
Law and order in Boxford is dealt with 
primarily by one uniformed police      
constable, (P.C. Walker).  P.C. Walker 
lives with his wife and two daughters  
in a police house in the centre of the 
village.  Boxford is the main area     
covered by P.C. Walker but he also has 
control over the nearby villages of    
Polstead, Edwardstone and Groton.  If  
officers in the nearby towns of        
Hadleigh and Sudbury are off sick or on
annual leave then P.C. Walker may be   
called to these areas.                 
                                       
P.C. Walker has a truncheon but it is  
not on view to the public.  The        
truncheon is in a pocket in his        
trousers called a pouch.  He also has  
handcuffs, which again are not on      
general view.                          
                                       </content>
