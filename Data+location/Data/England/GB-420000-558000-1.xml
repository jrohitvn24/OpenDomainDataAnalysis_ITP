		<content>    Four communities form part of the  
 town's western suburbs with their own 
 local shops and amenities.            
   Seperating each are areas of        
 countryside on which there is a       
 mixture of arable land, woodland and  
 recreational space.                   
   Lobley Hill is an area of council   
 and private housing built since the   
 mid 1930's.                           
   Whickham still retains a village    
 atmosphere, with its main street and  
 older houses, but has in recent years 
 become a major area of new housing    
 development.                          
   Sunniside and Marley Hill retain    
 much of the appearance of former      
 mining villages, although Sunniside   
 has altered most through development  
 in recent years.
