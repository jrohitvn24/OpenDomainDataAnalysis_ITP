		<title>16"Children of the World"</title>
		<content>    It was quite an honour for the     
 school to be invited to join in a     
 venture to create a record in aid of  
 the {Save The Children Fund.}For weeks
 we had been watching T.V. pictures of 
 starving children in Ethiopia and the 
 Sudan and now we could do something   
 about it.                             
    After auditions a dozen or so boys 
 and girls were invited to the "Music  
 Factory" Recording Studio at Parkgate 
 in Rotherham.Kevin McVann was to      
 record his song "Children of the      
 World" and one of our parents,John    
 Pickles, was to sing his own          
 composition "Save the Children" with  
 the Barnburgh pupils providing the    
 backing for both songs.               
    Mrs Buxton had done a good job and 
 the end product sounded very          
 professional.It was a tremendous      
 experience in aid of a worthy cause.  </content>
