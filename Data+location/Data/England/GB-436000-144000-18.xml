   At cubs we have a football team     
 called the 3rd Andover Cubs.Our colour
 is a gold top with black shorts.      
   Another team is 1st Jubilee.They    
 have just played in Middle Wallop.    
   Sports Day is one of the most       
 exciting days at school.Our three     
 house teams have to sit in pens and   
 watch.We are allowed to cheer.A few   
 people in each house bring along a    
 mascot like a teddy.When you come in  
 1st,2nd or 3rd you get a card and     
 someone writes your name and house.   
   Some of the races are the sack race,
 skipping,sprint and relay.            
   In the sack race you jump in a sack 
 to the end.                           
   We have a tube called a baton to    
 pass in the relay race.
