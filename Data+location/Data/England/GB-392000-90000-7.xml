 some mud flats and woodland. It is    
 mostly quicksand and it sometimes     
 floods. The mud flats are gradually   
 getting smaller. It smells awful      
 but there are lots of butterflies.    
                                       
 A{Spitfire}crashed in the mud in World
 War Two. Also many bombs were dropped 
 in the area as there was an important 
 cordite factory here. Some bombs are  
 still in the mud.                     
                                       
 The trees are{beech, fir and silver   
{birch.}You have to have a special     
 permit to get into the Reserve.       
 There is clay under the mud. The mud  
 goes right into Poole harbour. You    
 can see{foxes and deer}in the         
 woodland.
