		<title>08VILLAGE LIFE : WALL.</title>
		<content>  Wall village was once a Roman        
settlement and has a museum of Roman   
artefacts and an excavated bath house  
which attracts many visitors.          
  The village school closed in 1978 and
the younger children now have to travel
to nearby Shenstone, the older children
attending school in Lichfield. At the  
top of the hill stands the church of   
St.John the Baptist. There are no      
shops, one public house, "The Trooper",
and a very limited bus service.        
  Manor Farmhouse was built in 1669 and
is situated at the top of the village. 
  Centre of activity is the village    
Hall which is used for snooker and     
darts, evening classes, weekly Whist   
Drives, Wedding receptions, parties    
and the Women's Institute monthly      
meetings                               
  In 1982 seven old peoples' bungalows 
were built opposite the village green. </content>
