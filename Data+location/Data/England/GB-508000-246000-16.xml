		<title>16Oil Seed Rape Survey</title>
		<content>   Most people in Bedfordshire can tell
 you  that  rape  is  yellow ,  but  we
 wondered  how  many knew what the crop
 looks  like  close  to. So  we  took a
 stalk  with  pods, round the school.  
 Of those we asked:                    
                                       
  { 55% knew it was oil seed rape      
   {45% didn't know                    
                                       
   When asked what it was used for they
 all  said it was used for cooking oil.
 We found  out  the oils and  fats were
 used like this:                       
                                       
   {56% Food making                    
   {21% Margarine                      
   { 7% Cooking oil                    
   {16% Industrial use.(Soap/make-up.) 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
