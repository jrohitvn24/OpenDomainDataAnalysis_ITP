		<content>  {FARMING IN THE GOOSTREY AREA}       
 Most of the farms are dairy farms. To 
 the north of the area there are many  
 fairly small farms of less than 50    
 acres, rented from Cheshire County    
 Council. This land was divided up for 
 rent after the First World War. The   
 most common breed of cow is           
 Friesian. The herds vary in size from 
 38 to 100 milking cows. The smaller   
 farms all use artificial insemination 
 or else rent a bull. One large farm   
 has its own bull. Non-productive cows 
 and bull calves are sent to Chelford  
 Market. Most of the land is managed   
 grassland. Potatoes and barley are the
 most common cash crops. The farms all 
 have two or more tractors. The other  
 machinery owned varies from farm to   
 farm. Contractors' machinery is used  
 for large specialised jobs.
