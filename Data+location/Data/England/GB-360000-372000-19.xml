		<content> In the Weaverham/Hartford block there 
 is one High School for children aged  
 11-16.Children go to Sir John Deane's 
 Sixth Form College in Northwich to    
 take their A Levels.There are four    
 Primary Schools, Weaverham Forest,    
 Wallerscote, Hartford C.p. and St.    
 Bede's R.C. School. The private school
 The Grange caters for all ages between
 4 and 18.                             
   Wallerscote and Weaverham Forest are
 both suffering from the 1980s problem 
 of 'falling rolls'. There is little   
 school building around Weaverham and  
 smaller families proportionately      
 affect school rolls. Wallerscote      
 Infant and junior schools have now    
 merged onto the Junior site.Weaverham 
 Forest has been able to set up a Craft
 room and library using empty class    
 rooms.
