		<title>13Supernatural in S. Bradford.</title>
		<content>{Bolling Hall,}now a museum has at     
 least one call to fame.It is supposed 
 to contain a{ghost room.}This is the  
 bedroom in which the Earl of Newcastle
 slept after his victory at Adwalton   
 Moor during the{Civil War}in 1643.The 
 hall was his headquarters before his  
 attack on Bradford.It is said that the
 Earl of Newcastle intended killing    
 everyone in the town but during his   
 sleep he was visited by a ghost who   
 cried{'Pity poor Bradford;Pity poor   
{Bradford.'}Whatever happened that     
 night the following day the town was  
 plundered but only those who resisted 
 were executed.Bradford was attacked on
 two occasions and remained a staunch  
 friend of Parliament.
