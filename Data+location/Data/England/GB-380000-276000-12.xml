 The Leisure Centre in Kidderminster   
 was started in 1983 and is due to be  
 finished at the end of 1985. It has a 
 huge swimming pool with a wave machine
 and a large slide. It has five squash 
 courts, a small gymnasium and a       
 creche. There are plans for phase II  
 to be built in the future - facilities
 for badminton, table-tennis, training,
 five-a-side football etc.             
                                       
 It is hoped that this Leisure Centre  
 will attract people from far afield.  
 It is an ambitious and imaginative    
 scheme providing facilities for       
 Kidderminster which will be unique in 
 the Midlands.
