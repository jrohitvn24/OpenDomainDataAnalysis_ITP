		<content> There is often a strong smell of fresh
 bread on Penistone Road-there are     
 worse smells. One bakery is Sunblest, 
 the other is Fletchers-which is the   
 biggest bakery run by a family.       
                                       
 Fletchers make three quarters of a    
 million loaves of bread every week. It
 takes six minutes to make the dough   
 and twenty seven minutes for a large  
 loaf to cook. It only takes eight     
 minutes to cook a breadcake.          
                                       
 We have hard flour for bread and soft 
 flour for things like pastry.
