		<title>18SURNAMES IN MILDENHALL</title>
		<content> The main thing we found out in this   
 survey is that few names have survived
 since the{1881 census.}A few like     
 Barnett have survived but the others  
 have either moved out of the area or  
 died out.We also found out that       
 although some people must have moved  
 out of the area there are still many  
 local people around.There were a few  
 foreign names mostly by marriage.     
  We looked up the meaning of some of  
 the surnames and found the results    
 quite interesting eg Gross was given  
 to somebody who was thick,big or fat. 
  In the{church}we found the oldest    
 grave is dated 1684 and the newest is 
 dated 1982.The youngest person buried 
 there was Albert Sawyer who was 5     
 months old.The oldest person buried   
 there was a Maud Chambers who died at 
 101.
