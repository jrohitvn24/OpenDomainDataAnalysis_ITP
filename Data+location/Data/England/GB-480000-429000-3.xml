 They certainly catch them young at    
 Gilberdyke Primary School - and they  
 don't let the adults slip the net     
 either! Parents are encouraged to help
 their children learn to read and the  
 school has even prepared a booklet to 
 explain how they can do so.           
                                       
 The school prepares children for their
 education after they leave their      
 primary school by seeing that they    
 have a good grasp of the basics -     
 reading, writing and arithmetic. But  
 it is not just the basics that are    
 taught - the children are learning to 
 use computers and word processors and 
 learning about business from their own
 school bank.
