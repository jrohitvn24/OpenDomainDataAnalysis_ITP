		<content>In our area there are five farms of    
different sizes. They grow crops like  
corn, hay, straw, strawberries and     
gooseberries. They keep different kinds
of animals like cows, pigs, chickens,  
horses and sheep. Some farms have a    
little bit of Â£pick-your-own'          
strawberries, gooseberries and other   
soft fruit. Some of the animals go to  
Thame or Aylesbury markets. Some of the
farms are mixed and arable. Some are   
all grass and rough pasture. One of the
farms has mostly dairy cows and the    
farmer has a milk round. This farmer   
also keeps horses for show jumping. Two
the farms are in Tetsworth village.
