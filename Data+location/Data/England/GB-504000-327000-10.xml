		<title>10CHURCH LIFE,KIRKBY UNDERWOOD</title>
		<content>   Many of the principal events of the 
 area centre around the parish church  
 of St.Mary and All Saints, although   
 the hamlet of Hawthorpe belongs to the
 parish of Irnham.                     
 Although the parish is in interregnum 
 pending a decision on whether or not  
 Kirkby  Underwood, with  neighbours   
 Aslackby, join the parishes of Dowsby,
 Dunsby and Rippingale, the church is  
 fairly active albeit congregations are
 small. There is a weekly service with 
 Family Service once a month in which  
 children of the village are actively  
 involved,reading and recorder-playing.
 There are special services at Easter, 
 Harvest Festival and Christmas with   
 much more village and surrounding area
 involvement; help with decorating the 
 church, supporting the "Harvest       
 Auction" and the Christmas Nativity.
