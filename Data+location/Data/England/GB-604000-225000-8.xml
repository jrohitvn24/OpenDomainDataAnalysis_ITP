		<content>    Usually we get up at about 7.30    
 a.m.We have breakfast and then feed   
 the{pets,}geese and ducks.Sometimes   
 during the Winter months my husband   
 rides in{Pre 1965 British}built       
{Motorcycle Trials.}We set off at      
 approx 9 a.m.At 10 o'clock we arrive  
 at our destination,which is usually in
 a wood.We then meet all the           
 competitors. At 10.30 a.m. the Trial  
 begins and each rider is given a      
 number,they set off at 1 minute       
 intervals.At 12.30 we have our lunch  
 break before the afternoon session.The
 Trials usually finish at about 3 p.m. 
 when the weather is beginning to turn 
 cold and dark.                        
    Sometimes during the Summer we go  
 to the{beach}or a{gymkhana,}or we     
 may cut the{lawn}and go for a{walk. } 
 Occasionally we go to the{church.
