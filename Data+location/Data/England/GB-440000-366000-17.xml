		<title>17SPEECH IN GRASSMOOR.</title>
		<content> When some of the people around        
 Grassmoor talk it is quite different  
 from the announcer on the B.B.C.      
 "I wo fost and she's got munken."     
 means I was first and she is sulking. 
 "Gee oer elsam smackin thee in." means
 Stop it or I will smack you.          
 "Weerz tharowd man ?" means           
 Where is your father ?                
                                       
 People in the area often chop off the 
 letters 't' and 'h' from words.       
 "I' i' a bi' 'arder." means           
 Hit it a bit harder.                  
                                       
 'Youth' is a word which means friend. 
 "Oreyt youth ?" and "A yer winnin'    
 youth ?" are greetings meaning are you
 well ?                                
 The man spoken to might be seventy    
 years old. The word 'youth' does not  
 always mean young man.                </content>
