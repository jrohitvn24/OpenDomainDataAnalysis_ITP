		<content>   ALEX Age 11- on a Wednesday and a   
 Sunday I play{Rugby}at Newton-le-     
 Willows Sports Club.  Wednesday is    
{training}night when we are made to    
 work very hard.  During the season we 
 play{matches}on a Sunday and are      
 usually very successful.  We have lots
 of{fund raising activities}to help pay
 for our kit and the minibus which     
 takes us to away matches.  My sister  
 Joanne also likes sport.  Every week  
 she travels to Warrington to a{       
{Gymnastics Club.}She has entered a lot
 of{competitions}and has won quite a   
 few trophies.                         
   DAWN and TRACY- Our{Guide Company}  
 meets at the{Church Hall}on Monday    
 evenings.  We do lots of different    
 activities to help us pass various    
{badges. }It's not all work though, for
 sometimes we go out and play games or 
 go on{parades.                        </content>
