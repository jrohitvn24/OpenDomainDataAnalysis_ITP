		<content> INTERESTS HERE ARE VARIED.  THE       
 HAUGHTON ROAD IS FAVOURED BY JOGGERS, 
 WALKERS, CYCLISTS AND MOTOR CYCLISTS. 
 THE POPULAR CYCLE IS BMX AND THE SKILL
 TO PERFORM 'WHEELIES'.  RIVER{FISHING 
 IS POPULAR BUT MUCH OF THE RIVER IS   
 PRIVATELY OWNED SO ONE MUST JOIN THE  
 FISHING CLUB OR BUY A WEEKLY/DAILY    
 LICENCE.  SEVERAL YOUNGSTERS HORSE    
 RIDE FOR PLEASURE, HUNTING OR AS PART 
 OF THEIR WORK.  IN THE EVENINGS YOUNG 
 ADULTS MEET IN THE LOCAL{HOSTELRY}TO  
 DRINK BEER OR SOFT DRINKS AND PLAY    
 POOL; DARTS, DOMINOES AND THE 'WEEKLY 
 DRAW' ARE POPULAR AT THE CROWN.       
 PRACTICALLY EVERY HOUSEHOLD HAS       
 TELEVISION AND RADIO WHICH KEEPS THE  
 INHABITANTS UP TO DATE WITH NEWS AND  
 'POP' MUSIC.  THE BOOK STALL AT FETES 
 PROVIDES READING MATTER BUT MANY LOOK 
 FORWARD TO THE FORTNIGHTLY VISIT OF   
 THE COUNTY{LIBRARY}VAN.               </content>
