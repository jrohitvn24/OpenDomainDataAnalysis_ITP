		<title>15BRASS CASTLE &amp; HUNGER HILL</title>
		<content>  Brass Castle and Hunger Hill Farm are
 farmed together as a joint unit by one
 family. They cover approximately 260  
 acres .  Each of the two farms has one
 farmhouse on it.                      
                                       
  Main crops are: Barley, Wheat, Rape, 
 Peas and Beans. Pigs are kept and     
 beasts are also fattened. There is    
 deciduous woodland of approximately   
 1/2 acre.                             
                                       
  Brass Castle is thought to be derived
 from an old Roman name. A Roman Road  
 runs through the farm although        
 no traces are visible now.
