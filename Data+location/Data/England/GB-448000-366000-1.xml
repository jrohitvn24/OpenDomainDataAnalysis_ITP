		<content>   The area lies on Permian Limestone  
 and Marl;it is rural in character and 
 traversed by only the main roads.There
 are four main sections:_              
 1.the western suburbs of the mining   
 settlements of Shirebrook and Langwith
 Junction.This is largely  composed of 
 semi_detached council houses,some now 
 in poor condition.                    
 2.The small, attractive settlements of
 Scarcliffe and Stony Houghton,home of 
 farmworkers,woodmen and gamekeepers   
 amongst others                        
 3.Arable farmland,featuring cereals   
 (especially barley),potatoes and      
 oilseed rape.The farms are generally  
 large and prosperous.                 
 4.Roseland and Langwith Woods,where   
 the hardwoods were recently felled    
 to be replaced by Corsican Pines.The  
 woods are used for pheasant shooting  
 and provide pleasant walks..          </content>
