		<title>16RECREATION IN FAIR OAK</title>
		<content>    Fair Oak residents organise a wide 
 range of recreational activities.     
    The recreation ground is fully used
 and is constantly being improved.     
 Recently an all-weather cricket pitch 
 has been installed.                   
    On November 5th each year a        
 gigantic bonfire and firework display 
 are staged in the corner of the       
 recreation ground, and attended by    
 people from surrounding areas.        
    There is one village football team 
 and also 6 football clubs for boys.   
    The Squash Club has three courts.  
 For five years out of seven, the club 
 has won the championship of the       
 Hampshire Premier League. There are   
 also Keep Fit classes and Badminton,  
 Judo, Karate, Tennis and Trampolining 
 clubs for adults and for children.    
    An Art Club and a Camera club give 
 pleasure to members and to the public.</content>
