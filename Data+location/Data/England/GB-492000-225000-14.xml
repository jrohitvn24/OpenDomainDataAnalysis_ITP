		<title>14SAND QUARRIES 2 L. BUZZARD</title>
		<content> Joseph Arnold excavate six sand       
 quarries and the extracted sands are  
 sent to a main processing plant which 
 is at a quarry outside this area. At  
 present they employ 40 excluding      
 management, some of which carry out   
 maintenance work to machinery. The    
 company believes it can remain        
 quarrying at least some types of sand 
 for at least a further 50 years. Areas
 to be worked are stripped of topsoil  
 and clay overburden by excavators and 
 dumptrucks or scrapers. These         
 materials are stored in heaps for     
 restoring the land at a later date or 
 taken to another area when restoration
 is needed. Sand can be dug by         
 excavators or loading shovels. There  
 are very few stones in Leighton       
 Buzzard sand. The largest stones are  
 found are normally no bigger than 6mm 
 and these are sold as fine shingle.   </content>
