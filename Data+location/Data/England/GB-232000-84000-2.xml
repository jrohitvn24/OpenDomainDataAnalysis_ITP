		<title>02   CHANGES IN THE TOWN</title>
		<content> 11 year old children who have always  
 lived locally, can remember changes in
 the park, the new White Hart{Shopping}
 Arcade where there was once the hotel 
 garage, the Market Hall Arcade  on the
 site of the original Pannier Market   
 and the Halifax Building Society      
 replacing a large outfitter's shop. In
 1984, we saw the Central Methodist    
 Church Spire demolished because it was
 unsafe. J.B.Smith's garage by the Town
 Hall was closed. Near by a new bus    
 stop and new road layouts have        
 recently been completed. Fifty years  
 ago there was a cold open-air swimming
 pool in Underlane and in nearby       
 Newport an abattoir, a tannery and    
 saddler's shop. Forty years ago       
 Trecarrell, Woburn and Hurdon estates 
 were started when people needed homes 
 after the war. Then came more in      
 Dunheved Road  and St. Stephen's.     </content>
