		<content>  People sometimes worry about their   
 health but not often unless they      
 become ill. Lots of people have joined
 the jogging and running craze. We've  
 just had a mini marathon in Bradford. 
  Cancer worries people most because   
 they don't know what causes it - the  
 atmosphere, food additives, our way of
 life, radioactivity, asbestos,        
 pollution?                            
  A few people have become concerned   
 with their diet and patronise health  
 food shops but most take only a       
 superficial interest in their health. 
 Too much eating causes obesity which  
 is quite a problem among children as  
 well as grown ups.                    
  Drugs and glue sniffing isn't a big  
 problem in Bradford but children try  
 smoking cigarettes still and alchohol 
 abuse is a health problem.
