		<title>07THE CHURCH IN FELMINGHAM</title>
		<content> Felmingham Church, dedicated to{St.   
{Andrew,}has a Family Eucharist each   
 Sunday at 10.00 am. A Eucharist is    
 held each Wednesday morning, and also 
 on major Saints' Days.                
 To help learn about the Beliefs of{The
{Church of England,}a Bible Study Group
 meets once every 3 weeks. For the     
 encouragement of younger members of   
 the Church, there is a{Sunday School} 
 for those under 8; and 2{Youth        
{Fellowships}for those between 8 &amp; 16. 
 The Church is kept neat and tidy by a 
 rota of ladies, who both clean and    
 make flower arrangements.             
 Coffee follows the Eucharist on the   
 first Sunday of each month, served    
 under the Tower.                      
 The fellowship of the congregation is 
 helped by monthly lunches and special 
 social events.
