		<title>09CLACTON LIFEBOAT</title>
		<content> Some Sundays the crew of the Clacton  
 Lifeboat have a practice run where    
 they see how fast they can launch     
 both the boats.The Skipper showed     
 us around the Inshore boat and gave us
 information about it.It has one       
 outboard on it which gives it a top   
 speed of about 20 miles per hour.It   
 has plenty of radio equipment on it,  
 for if it runs into difficulty's at   
 sea.It has been launched 370 times and
 has saved over 219 lives.Then we went 
 on the Pier to see the larger Lifeboat
 being launched.It is whinched down a  
 ramp into the sea.The main boat has 2 
 outboards and a top speed of 30 mph.  
 The main boat is only used in an      
 emergency like if a trawler sinks.    
 In a real emergency they call in a    
 Sea-king helecopter.The Inshore boat  
 is used for things like if a Dingy    
 floated out to sea.                   </content>
