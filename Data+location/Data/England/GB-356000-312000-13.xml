		<title>13THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> THE VILLAGE HALL BELONGS TO THE WHOLE 
 VILLAGE.  THE MAIN SOCIAL EVENTS ARE  
 HELD HERE.  THERE ARE DANCES, BINGO,  
 CONCERTS, PANTOMIMES AND FUND RAISING 
 EVENTS. THE LOCAL DRAMA GROUP HAVE    
 THEIR REHEARSALS HERE, THE SENIOR     
 CITIZENS HAVE A LUNCH ONCE A WEEK, THE
 DOCTOR HOLDS HIS SURGERY HERE ONCE A  
 WEEK, THE SCHOOL USES IT AND IT IS    
 AVAILABLE FOR HIRE FOR PRIVATE        
 PARTIES. EVERY SUMMER THERE IS A PLAY 
 SCHEME FOR THE LOCAL CHILDREN,        
 FINANCED BY THE LOCAL DISTRICT        
 COUNCIL, BUT HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL.
 WITHOUT SUCH A MEETING PLACE THE      
 COMMUNITY LIFE OF A SMALL VILLAGE     
 WOULD SUFFER.                         
 THERE HAS BEEN ONE BREAK-IN.  WASHING-
 UP LIQUID WAS SQUIRTED ON THE FLOOR TO
 MAKE A SLIDE, BUT NO GREAT DAMAGE WAS 
 DONE.                                 
                                       </content>
