		<content> Spare time in our village was spent at
 brownies,guides and youth club,which  
 was run by the village post-man Mr    
 Smith.Some children played down the   
 Brook or climbing trees.Instead of a  
 Village Hall there was a "Red Triangle
 Hut" where village "hops" were held.  
 These were dances at which dance bands
 played.There was a local flower show  
 held annually on the corner of Swan   
 Lane and A20 main road.A sports day   
 was held there as well.For adults     
 there were the W.I.,cricket and       
 football clubs and Womens Legion,     
 gardeners and young wives.Mrs Corner  
 and Mrs Crouch said they preferred the
 village in the 1950's because it was  
 more of a community than it seems in  
 1985.
