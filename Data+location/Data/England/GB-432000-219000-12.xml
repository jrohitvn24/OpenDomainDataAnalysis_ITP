		<title>12CHARLBURY SCHOOL CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>  At 8.15 I get up and dress ready for 
school. On Wednesdays I have to take my
violin. We have the register first then
we all go into assembly where we sing  
hymns and are talked to. When we get   
back our teacher talks to us. We plan  
what we are going to do then I have my 
violin lesson, after which it's        
playtime. I play "cavalry charge" or   
football. The bell rings at 11.00. We  
all come in and continue with our work.
Lunch is at 12.00.You can have a school
dinner or packed lunch. Dinner play    
lasts for an hour. We come in, have the
register and either carry on with the  
morning's activities or start something
new.We have another play which lasts   
for 15 minutes then we tidy up.We have 
a story then go home.I walk to Dad's   
office and then to a house called      
"Appletrees" for my recorder lesson.I  
go to Guides from 6.15 until 7.45.     </content>
