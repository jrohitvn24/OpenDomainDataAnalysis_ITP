		<content>{St. James Church}in{Oddingley}is      
 situated near a few houses in the     
 local village.The actual church is    
 constructed on a clay base, as the    
 soil is made of clay, and the stones  
 are made of limestone.                
 The Vicar lives in the neighbouring   
 village, Tibberton.The graves are     
 mainly old,the oldest dating from as  
 far back as 1657.Some of the graves   
 have  no headstones,which was probably
 due to the fact that some families    
 were very poor.The registers date     
 from 1661,and these registers are     
 preserved in the  Diocesan Record     
 Office in Worcester.                  
 The church stonework and painted glass
 are mainly 15th century.One window    
 shows the conection with the{Neville  
 family and  another shows the arms of 
 the house of{Mortimer.}There is also a
 memorial to the murdered rector.      </content>
