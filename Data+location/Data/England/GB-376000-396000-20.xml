		<title>20The Manchester Ship Canal</title>
		<content>   It is sad to see the Manchester Ship
 Canal these days. It was opened on    
 1st. Jan. 1894 and was an immediate   
 success. Streams of ships used it and 
 large docks opened in Manchester and  
 Salford. There were five miles of     
 quays and a giant grain storage       
 elevator.                             
 Now everything is closed. The elevator
 has been demolished and the only ships
 to use the canal are sludge boats     
 carrying sewage out to sea. The swing 
 bridge never opens and cranes lie     
 idle. It takes so long to cover the   
 the 36 miles from Liverpool to        
 Manchester by water that firms now use
 lorries along the M62 motorway which  
 connects Liverpool and Manchester.    
 Work has already begun to redevelop   
 Salford Docks as boating marinas      
 surrounded by hotels, restaurants,    
 shops and new housing.                </content>
