		<content> Apart from farming,which is dealt with
 separately,local industries are small 
 and light.One of these is Peck Vehicle
 Heating.This is a small family run    
 engineering company engaged in design 
 and manufacture of heaters for        
 commercial vehicles.The factory is on 
 a former railway siding where Queen   
 Victoria's royal train would night    
 stop to Scotland.COSIRA were involved 
 in setting up a factory which employs 
 17 people but generates work in three 
 other towns.Gordon Marshall runs his  
 business at the Mill on the A17       
 leading from the village towards      
 Newark.Until recently,reclaimed timber
 was sold here,which was a great asset 
 to people carrying out repairs to old 
 buildings. Now the business is devoted
 to the manufacture of pine furniture. 
 Eighteen people are employed by the   
 firm.                                 </content>
