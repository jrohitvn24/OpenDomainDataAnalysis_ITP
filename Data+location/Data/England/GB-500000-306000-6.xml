		<content> THE GAMES WHICH CHILDREN PLAY IN THE  
 PLAYGROUNDare numerous and varied. As 
 this survey was carried out at        
 Stamford Boys School the games are    
 male orientated.These were the        
 favourites:                           
 TIG-requires 3 or more players. One   
 person is chosen to be 'it' and must  
 try to touch the other players.Once   
 you are tigged you must become 'it'.  
 BRITISH BULLDOG- there are two people 
 'it' and two walls about 50 metres    
 apart. You have to run to each wall   
 without being tigged. Once tigged you 
 join the two who are already 'it'.    
 AKI AKI- One person is 'it' and counts
 to 100 whilst everybody hides. The    
 people in hiding then have to get back
 to a predetermined 'home' (e.g. a     
 bench), and the last person home      
 without being tigged becomes the next 
 'it'                                  </content>
