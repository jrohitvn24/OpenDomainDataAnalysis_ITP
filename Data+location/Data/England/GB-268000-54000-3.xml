		<content> The area is traversed mainly by two   
 roads - one from Ugborough/Plymouth   
 to Avonwick/Modbury joining at Wells  
 Cross, and the others crossing at     
 Kitterford Cross.  All {Crossroads}   
 are named, e.g. Wells Cross, and at   
 these points there are signposts to   
 assist the traveller.  There are also 
 many minor lanes which are very       
 narrow, having a few passing places,  
 which are essential as the lanes will 
 generally accommodate only one vehicle
 at a time. There is NO public         
 transport; hence the need for         
 residents to own at least one car,    
 however old and utilitarian.  There is
 a network of{public footpaths,}most of
 which are regularly used throughout   
 the year, and by a few visitors in the
  "Season". No Post Office, but mail   
 collection &amp; delivery by van daily. a
