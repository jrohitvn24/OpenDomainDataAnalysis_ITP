 children age{5 to 16.}Three types of  
 school cater for these ages-{Infant   
 from 5 to 7 years,{Junior}from 7 to 11
 years and{Secondary}11 to 16 years.   
    {Infants}and{Juniors}are often     
 housed in the same building which is  
 called a{Primary School.              
     These schools vary in appearance  
 and in methods of teaching.Some have  
 small rooms with doors where a group  
 of perhaps 30 children are taught by  
 one teacher.Others are{open-plan}with 
 no real physical brriers,where the    
 children are taught in{small groups   
 and the teachers may{share the        
{teaching.

 built in 1973,of this open plan type.
