		<content>  Ellesmere is a small market town set 
 in the centre of a group of lakes or  
 meres of glacial origin.Recently it   
 has tended to loose some of it's      
 importance as a centre for North      
 Shropshire due to the transfer of the 
 council offices to Wem.               
  After becoming rather run down,the   
 centre of the town has undergone      
 considerable renovation.There is also 
 a small increase in the population due
 to new areas of housing on infill     
 sites and around the edge of the town.
  The whole area forms part of the rich
 North Shropshire dairy farming belt.  
 There is a large creamery originally  
 owing  it's existence to it's         
 canalside position.The canal in turn  
 now forms a major tourist attraction  
 for the town being centrally placed on
 the popular Llangollen Canal.
