		<title>11A Day out at Gillerthwaite</title>
		<content> We woke up early and got              
 dressed.Breakfast was at 8.0O'clock.My
 group had to help to prepare it and   
 then wash up afterwards.By the time we
 had got our things ready and made our 
 sandwiches it was 10.00a.a.m.         
             We set off in a group of  
 12 children and 2 teachers to go up   
 Red Pike.We set off on a path that    
 took us up above the tree line.It was 
 hard going after this and the path was
 step in parts.At last we reached the  
 top.We had a superb view of the lakes 
 Buttermere,Crummock and the fells     
 beyond.                               
             After eating our lunch    
 which we were ready for we took some  
 photographs and then made our         
 descent.By the timewe got back to the 
 centre  it was late afternoon.We had  
 time to go for a swim in the River    
 that runs past the centre.            </content>
