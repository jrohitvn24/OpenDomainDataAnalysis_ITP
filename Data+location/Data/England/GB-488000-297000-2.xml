		<content> Three wide, gently-sloping ridges run 
 west to east towards the flood plain  
 of the River Welland, separated by    
 shallow valleys. The soils are mostly 
 clay, artificially drained in the     
 fields, and thin on the hilltops to   
 expose the ironstone rock.            
                                       
{Arable Farming}                       
 Many farms are large - over 250 acres,
 with fields of 80 acres or more. Most 
 of the farms are owner-occupied. In   
 recent years hedges have been removed 
 to allow for greater use of machinery.
 Wheat, barley, potatoes and oil-seed  
 rape are grown, with some peas, beans 
 and oats.

 Fresian cattle give milk and beef,    
 sheep for meat and some wool, while   
 horses are grazed in local paddocks.  </content>
