   The Suffolk Show is held every year 
on   the  Suffolk  Show  Ground   near 
Bucklesham Road. This year it was held 
on  Wednesday 29th  and  Thursday 30th 
May.  There were a lot of stalls, more 
than  last  year, and  there were more 
people.  It was a record attendance of 
84,180  people.  It costs 2 Pounds for 
an  adult  and 1 Pound 50 for a child. 
There  were  lots  of  new stalls like 
Radio Orwell and Anglia TV.            
                                       
  The  main  purpose  of  the  show is 
farming and  agriculture so there were 
also  many  pig, sheep, cow  and  goat 
pens. There was a bird  tent, a rabbit 
show  and a flower show.    There were 
displays connected with energy, houses 
and  cooking  with  microwaves.        
The local newspapers also had a stand.
