		<content>THE LACK OF PUBLIC SERVICES            
 To live in this rural area it is      
almost essential to have the use of a  
private car. Sandhurst is a mere 5km   
from the centre of Gloucester yet there
is only one bus a week between them,   
although there used to be a daily ser- 
vice. Even the nearest main road is    
over 2km from the village.             
 West of the River Severn there is a   
regular bus service along the main A417
road between Gloucester and Hartpury.  
Residents in the Woolridge area have to
walk from the main road and one or two 
even walk 3km to the shop in Maisemore 
or 2km to Hartpury.                    
 The River Severn is occasionally used 
by barges as far as Tewkesbury and by  
pleasure craft and fishermen.  A small 
airstrip has been built at Willington  
Court Farm for use each year by crop   
spraying aircraft.                     </content>
