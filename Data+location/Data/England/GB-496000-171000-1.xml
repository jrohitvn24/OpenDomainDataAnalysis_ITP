		<title>01Introduction to the area.</title>
		<content>   Our grid is about 20 miles west of  
 London and lies in the Thames         
 Valley.The western half of the area is
 all within Windsor Great Park.The     
 eastern part is semi-rural with two   
 built up areas,the villages of Old    
 Windsor and Englefield Green.Cooper's 
 Hill,98 metres above sea level,is the 
 highest point and the topography      
 is generally hilly with a slope       
 running down to the Thames.           
   On the banks of the Thames is the   
 Runnymede area which is a popular     
 attraction for tourists and is        
 administered by the National Trust.   
   Although there are two              
 hospitals,several schools and a few   
 small shopping parades the area is not
 self sufficient and the inhabitants   
 rely heavily on the facilities of the 
 surrounding towns of                  
 Egham,Windsor,Staines and Slough.     </content>
