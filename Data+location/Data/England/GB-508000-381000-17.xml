 ancient woodland colonised by trees   
 since the Ice age glaciers.A prominent
 tree is the Leaved Lime which dates   
 back 5,000 years. In the 1960's part  
 of the woodland was felled and        
 re-planted with Norway Spruce.Oak is  
 the only tree being planted now to    
 grow on to maturity. There are four   
 varieties of orchids as well as       
 primroses, herbs, and grasses, forget 
 me-nots, lily-of-the-valley, blue bell
 pink clover, buttercups, violets,     
 daisies and dandelions.
