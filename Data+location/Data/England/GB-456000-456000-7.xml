		<title>07A Day In The Life of Emma</title>
		<content>     At 8.00am I get up,and get        
 dressed. The next job doesn't take    
 long and that's getting washed.Having 
 breakfast is my most favourite thing  
 in the morning. Then I set off for    
 school at 8.45am approx.so that I have
 time to play.At 9.00am, the teacher on
 duty calls us into school from the    
 playground. Next we read until 9.30   
 then it is assembly. At 10.00am we    
 begin maths. By the time 10.30 comes  
 everyone is ready for break.When we   
 come in the teacher is ready for      
 creative English. After that group    
 reading until 12.00 then yipee it's   
 dinner time! After dinner, art and    
 craft we made clay figures. At break  
 we played "elastics". After play all  
 the class played rounders until home  
 time.When I got home I went to Church 
 then I had tea at 6.30pm and I went to
 bed at 8.45pm.                        </content>
