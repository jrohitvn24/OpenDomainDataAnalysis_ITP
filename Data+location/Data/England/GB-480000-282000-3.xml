		<title>03Flats</title>
		<content> There are quite a few flats in        
 Desborough, and some first year pupils
 of Montsaye school went along to find 
 out how they lived and whether or not 
 the occupants were satisfied with     
 them.                                 
 From the result of visiting Desborough
 flats we found that people were       
 satisfied ,but minor changes could be 
 made.Most people in flats would like  
 more heating in bedrooms and          
 bathrooms.Overall they were pleased   
 with their flats but a few people     
 would like houses and gardens of their
 own.Interviews showed that most people
 lived in flats, fewer livwd in        
 bungalows, terraces or detatched      
 houses.                               
 It was interesting finding out        
 different{people's}different{opinions.
