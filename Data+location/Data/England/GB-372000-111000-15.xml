		<title>15The Law around Lydlinch</title>
		<content>   There is no local bobby these days. 
 The police are organised on an area   
 basis and this block is covered from  
 the Sherborne Police headquarters.    
   The nearest police station is in    
 Sturminster and one of the constables 
 from there has been assigned to       
 Lydlinch calling at the village       
 regularily. This is an attempt to try 
 and make some personal contact between
 the police and the community which has
 been missing since the introduction of
 patrol cars.                          
   The situation is the same in        
 Kingstag.
