		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF THE BLOCK</title>
		<content> The block is situated on {high ground}
 between 600'-1100'skirted by the      
 villages of Cragg Vale,Hubberton      
 Green,Mill Bank and Soyland.The       
 highest point lies to the north.The   
 ground initially falls gradually in   
 all directions and consists of        
 reasonably{flat fields}and some       
 marsh.To the west this gives way to a 
 very steep wooded area.The slopes to  
 the south-east fall more steeply after
 the plateau area.The area is drained  
 by{two tributaries}-Old Eli           
 Clough,originating in Flint's         
 Reservoir(now dried up),which falls   
 gradually through Cotton Stones and   
 below the small village of Mill       
 Bank,and secondly Nether Ends Beck    
 both leading to the west flowingRiver 
 Ryburn.The Elphin BrooK forms a       
 boundary in the north-west
