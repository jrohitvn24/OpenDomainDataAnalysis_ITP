		<title>17WOODS MANAGEMENT, FELBRIGG</title>
		<content>  Two woodsmen are responsible for the 
 woodland maintenance on the Felbrigg  
 Estate.  The busiest season is from   
 November to March, after an area has  
 been felled and cleared in the Autumn.
 It then has to be fenced, and young   
 saplings planted.  Spring is a period 
 of spraying and pruning, while July to
 the end of August is a period of      
 weeding young plantations.            
  Newly-planted areas are{block-planted
 with oak, pine, chestnut and beech in 
 blocks of nine.  Eventually, only one 
 tree from each block will remain.     
  With{woodland trails}and some areas  
 open to the public, another task is to
 take care of any damage.  Notices have
 to be replaced when removed, and      
 litter is also a problem.  A little   
 damage to young trees is also caused  
 by 20-30 deer (other wild animals     
 include foxes and grey squirrels).    </content>
