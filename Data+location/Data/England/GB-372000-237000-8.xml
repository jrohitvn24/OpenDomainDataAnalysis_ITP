		<content> Most people in the village have pets, 
 either cats or dogs.Dogs take an      
 important part in farm life.          
 Most people have electricity because  
 you can't get gas in the village      
 unless you have calor gas.When the men
 go to work the women tidy up the      
 house. Most of the mums have jobs at  
 home, or have to look after the       
 children, if the children are not old 
 enough to go to the village school.   
 Most people go to larger shops for    
 their household shopping in Ledbury,  
 only two miles away from Eastnor,     
 because the local shop recently closed
 down.Many of the houses are rented    
 therefore are not particulary modern  
 although some of the households now   
 have all the modern conveniences like 
 videos,dishwashers,computers etc..
