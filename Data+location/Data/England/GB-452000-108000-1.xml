		<title>01WYKEHAM HOUSE D BLOCK</title>
		<content>   Our D block is a rural area         
 consisting of country lanes, woodland 
 and farms.The Southampton to          
 Portsmouth railway runs diagonally    
 through the block.Part of the A3051   
 runs through two of the Western       
 squares while in the East a minor road
 links Tapnage and Shedfield Common,   
 one third of the area is covered by   
 deciduous woodland with the largest   
 extent being Botley Wood in the South.
   Two thirds of our area will be      
 affected by the proposed Whiteley plan
 which will alter the nature of the D  
 block if the plan goes through.       
{ ARTS AND CRAFTS                      
    Nobody practises Arts and Crafts in
 our area.
