		<content>     The present house at Combe        
 Sydenham is built in the shape of an  
 E.   It was built in 1580 and stands  
 on the ruins of some earlier monastic 
 buildings and there is a connection   
 between these and the other nearby    
 tourist attraction of{Cleeve Abbey.   
     During the{Civil War}the          
 buildings were subject to attack from 
 the soldiers of{Oliver Cromwell.      
 They did considerable damage to the   
 hall.   Completely destroying the East
 Bedroom Wing and three of the four    
 towers.   Only the West Wing was re   
 built in 1660 when{King Charles II    
 returned to the throne.               
    The ground floor of the House is   
 open to the public and they are lots  
 of information boards telling the     
 story.   Visitors can also explore the
{Elizabethan style gardens.
