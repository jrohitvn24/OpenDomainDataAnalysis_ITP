   A small chapel was standing on the  
 site in 1304.The Parish Church was    
 created out of Bisley Parish later in 
 1360,and the chapel enlarged.         
   The present tower and spire date    
 from 1360 but the rest of the church  
 was pulled down in 1868 to make room  
 for the new church.The present        
 building was consecrated in 1868.     
   The spire of the church dominates   
 views of Stroud from every direction. 
   The church is in the centre of      
 Stroud.                               
   The interior  of the church has been
 improved a lot in recent years like   
 the carved stone veredon which George 
 Gillert Scott made.                   
   There are ten bells in the tower.
