		<content> Most of the people who live in        
 Cranwell village have lived there for 
 more than two years, this is because  
 they are not posted, unlike the       
 families living on the air force base.
 The people in R.A.F. Cranwell have    
 often been posted to Britain from     
 other countries. People living on the 
 base have come from places in Germany,
 America, Cyprus and other air force   
 bases abroad.                         
 Some families are of a different      
 nationality, there are Germans,       
 Americans, Swiss and other            
 nationalities, including some from    
 as far away as New Zealand.
