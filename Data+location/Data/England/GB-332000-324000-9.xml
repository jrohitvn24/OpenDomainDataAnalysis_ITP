 WEST FELTON IS PREDOMINANTLY A FARMING
 AREA WITH A NUMBER OF TENANT FARMERS  
 ON THE TEDSMORE AND WOODHOUSE         
 ESTATES,AND SOME LARGER PRIVATELY     
 OWNED FARMS SUCH AS SANDFORD HALL AND 
 PRADOE.MOST FARMS ARE MIXED WITH      
 CATTLE,SHEEP,POTATOES AND SUGAR BEET  
 BEING THE MAIN VARIETIES.             
     PRADOE,BUILT IN 1785 IS TYPICAL OF
 THESE FARMS,AND COL. JOHN KENYON IS   
 THE 5TH GENERATION OF KENYONS TO LIVE 
 THERE.THE HOME FARM COMPRISES SOME 350
 ACRES,AND INCLUDES POTATOES,SUGAR     
 BEET,CEREALS,CALVES AND SUFFOLK SHEEP.
      PRADOE CHURCH WAS BUILT IN 1860  
 IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL     
 HAMLETS DID NOT HAVE TO WALK TOO FAR  
 TO CHURCH.RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE      
 UPKEEP AND RUNNING OF THE CHURCH RESTS
 WITH THE "TENANT-FOR-LIFE" OF PRADOE.
