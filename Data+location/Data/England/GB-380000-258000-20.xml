		<content>    What is notable about both Grimley 
 and Sinton Green is the lack of shops.
 There are three public houses where   
 items of food and drink may be pur-   
 chased and taken out. For other shop- 
 ping inhabitants have to use their    
 own transport or the bus services to  
 Hallow or Worcester.                  
    The milkman makes his delivery 4   
 days a week. An ice-cream man makes   
 his daily round in the summer. A      
 mobile grocer and baker come every    
 Thursday. Newspapers are delivered    
 daily. If requested you may have      
 deliveries of logs, coal and calor    
 gas.                                  
    There is a hairdressers for both   
 sexes. The premises  was formerly the 
 post office. There is a sub post      
 office in Grimley village but it sells
 no other items.
