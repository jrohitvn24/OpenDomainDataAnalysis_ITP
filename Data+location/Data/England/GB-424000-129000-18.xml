		<title>18Woodland Walk.Bentley Wood.</title>
		<content> On the 29th.June 1985 a group from    
 West Tytherley Primary School were    
 taken through the wood by Ralph       
 Whitlock,broadcaster and writer,and   
 Roy Pitman,naturalist.Their estimate  
 was that there were 8 to 10 million   
 trees.We saw that these tended to be  
 beech in the northern chalky part and 
 oak on the mixed soils to the south.  
 Nurse crops of conifers,planted when  
 The Forestry Commission managed the   
 wood,needed to be removed.A nature    
 trail was newly made with nest boxes  
 including one for kestrels.We found   
 spotted and butterfly orchids.There   
 were prints and tracks of badgers,deer
 and weasels.Insects were being studied
 with over 400species of moth found.   
 Butterflies abound-the fritilaries and
 purple emperor.The area is designated 
 one of special scientific interest.
