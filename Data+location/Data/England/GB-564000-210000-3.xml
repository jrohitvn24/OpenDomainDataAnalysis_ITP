   Mashbury and the Chignals are mainly
agricultural areas. Most of the        
buildings are farm houses and many of  
the remaining residences are occupied  
by the elderly.                        
   The houses that stand in this area  
are fairly old, e.g. Mashbury Hall     
and a number of them display the local 
art of pargeting.                      
   Most of the area is approximately   
77 metres above sea level and gently   
undulating. The majority of the land   
is used for growing crops, with a few  
copses. There are a number of small    
reservoirs in the area.                
   The soil comprises of a chalky      
boulder clay with belts of gravel      
running through it, which provides good
drianage for crop growing.             
   The gravel is also excavated for    
commercial use.                        </content>
