		<content>Within the area under study, only the  
village of Hornby has any commercial   
enterprises, although there is one very
small restaurant in Gressingham        
village.                               
There is a small industrial estate at  
the Southern end of Hornby which       
employs a few people. Lamb's Garage    
provides servicing and M.O.T.          
facilities for motor cars as well as   
the usual petrol, oil and sundries.    
Hornby has a Post Office which         
provides the usual range of services   
and which also carries a small         
selection of gifts,clothing and        
souvenirs. The general stores provide  
groceries, confectionaries, alchoholic 
drinks and  magazines and newspapers.  
The butcher provides the usual range   
of meats and dairy produce and the     
hardware store    supplies hardware,   
D.I.Y. materials and garden equipment. </content>
