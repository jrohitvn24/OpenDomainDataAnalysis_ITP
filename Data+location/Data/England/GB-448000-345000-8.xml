 The area studied by our school is not 
 industrialised, although there are{two
 small industrial estates and a large {
{bakery}and{brewery}in it.Some firms   
 employ over 100 people and some less  
 than 5 people.Goods are exported all  
 over the world by firms making        
 polypropylene flexible boxes and      
 railway track maintenance equipment.  
 Other modern technology exported world
 wide is in the field of{broadcasting, 
{electronics}and{computers.}Small firms
 are more common and they make toffee  
 apples, chocolate, kitchen equipment  
 and greeting cards.The area is a black
 one for unemployment in the county and
 in a survey we carried out there were 
 more men employed than women. The     
 majority of the firms take advantage  
 of the{Government Youth Training      
{Scheme. }                             </content>
