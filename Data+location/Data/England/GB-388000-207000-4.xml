		<content> The farms of the high flat land(see   
 introduction)are mainly mixed farms   
 with cereals,mostly barley but with   
 some wheat,and grassland for cutting  
 and pasture.Different crops,oilseed   
 rape and broad beans,were noted in    
 two fields only.Sheep were numerous   
 in some  places but cattle seemed to  
 predominate overall.There are several 
 specialist producers in the area      
 -amoung them being a rabbit farm and a
 pheasantry. The latter produces eggs, 
 day old chicks and poults-and they are
 sold throughout Britain and abroad.The
 birds lay between May and July.In     
 summer about 15 are employed-falling  
 to around 6 in the winter.            
 The steep valley sides are timbered   
 and the valley bottoms only suitable  
 for pasture- but where they widen some
 of the more gentle slopes are also    
 given over to cereals.                </content>
