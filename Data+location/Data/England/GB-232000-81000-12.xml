		<title>12Getting ready for school</title>
		<content> My alarm went off at 6.45. Very tired 
 I slowly got up and put my light on   
 and read my comic till 7.30.All the   
 time. I was listening to my radio.    
 I got up and put my brother's light on
 because he never wakes up on time to  
 go to school. Then I went down stairs 
 and put the kettle on and put 2 pieces
 of bread in the toaster, got my plate 
 and peanut butter out.My  mum came    
 down stairs in her dressing gown      
 because she does not work on a Friday.
 I went up stairs and got dressed while
 Mum got the breakfast and a cup of tea
 and I got my bag ready.               
 My brother had just finished his      
 breakfast.Then I cleaned my teeth     
 went downstairs and said "bye Mum     
 don't forget this afternoon"I went up 
 the hill and met my friend and we     
 walked to school.                     
                                       </content>
