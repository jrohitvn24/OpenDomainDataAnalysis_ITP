		<title>08NORTH SEA GAS REFINERY</title>
		<content>{BACKGROUND}The oil industry began to  
 take a serious interest in the North  
 Sea in 1959,when one of the largest   
 gas fields in the world was discovered
 at Groningen in Holland.This          
 discovery,in similar formations to a  
 much smaller gas field at Eskdale near
 the Yorkshire coast,suggested at the  
 strata underlying the southern North  
 Sea might be a source of oil or gas.  
{THE WEST SOLE GAS FIELD}The West Sole 
 gas field was discovered in September 
 1965,was the first commercial in the  
 North Sea and the first to start      
 feeding natural gas into the national 
 grid.The Rough field was discovered   
 later and was developed by Amaco.This 
 field is now empty and is being used  
 by British Gas as a storage facility. 
 British Gas have built a huge         
 compression and cleaning facility in  
 our area.                             </content>
