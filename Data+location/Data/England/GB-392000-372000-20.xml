		<title>20SERVICE INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> In addition to the varied types of    
 firms on the Hurdsfield Estage which  
 provide services to industry, there   
 are others which assist the community 
 at large. There is the Abattoir which 
 has been there for some time and which
 most felt was necessary and important.
 Few were keen to visit because of     
 their knowledge that animals arrive   
 alive but leave in a much different   
 state, though they admitted that they 
 seldom thought of this. A Cash and    
 Carry firm provides a service to large
 establishments,schools,clubs,church   
 groups and other organisations, in    
 offering special rates. A large DIY   
 store provides every type of material 
 for use practically anywhere,but      
 especially for the home handyman. For 
 those keen on gardening there are     
 allotments and nurseries.Power is also
 produced for industrial &amp; home use.   </content>
