		<content> Anne,a nurse,is in favour of today's  
 technology and of the use of          
 computers.She does not agree with them
 being used for maths.because she      
 believes you would not exactly be     
 learning anything.She likes modern    
 clothes,but doesn't like the shops    
 around Stockingford.                  
  Mr.Cross,when asked what he thought  
 of the government,laughed and then    
 replied,"Not very much."He thought the
 emergency services were excellent.    
  Mrs.Deakin did not think very much of
 the government.She thought children   
 were passable,and that the public     
 services are not bad.                 
  Mr.Albrighton did not think much to  
 the government,but thought the        
 emergency services were not bad.He    
 thinks there are too many shops.Both  
 he and his wife are retired.
