		<content>   In l966 the Bishop of Bedford       
 dedicated the new school building.    
   It has two classrooms with a hall in
 between.  There are folding doors     
 between the classrooms and the hall.  
 There are cloakrooms opening off the  
 classrooms and washbasins in the      
 classrooms. The classrooms and the    
 hall open on to the playground. The   
 playing field is joined on to the     
 playground. We have a swimming pool   
 with a fence all round it. There is a 
 place to store things, a staff room   
 and a kitchen for cooking our dinners.
   When I was eight we had some new    
 things. We had a computer, a coloured 
 television and a video recorder. We   
 have a stereo record player, a piano  
 and lots of books, pencils, felt tips 
 and pens.  We have central heating    
 from a big boiler.
