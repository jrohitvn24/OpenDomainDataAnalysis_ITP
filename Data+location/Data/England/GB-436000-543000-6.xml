		<content> The Parish church of S.Hetton which   
 stands to the West of the main road   
 through the village was built in 1838 
 and has been extended three times     
 since that date.                      
     The church is built of local      
 sandstone and has a timber and slate  
 roof. It seats 350 persons and        
 conducts daily services. It stands in 
 a large churchyard which contains the 
 graves of miners killed in the Haswell
 Mine disaster which occurred in 1844. 
     Plans are being developed to build
 a new church hall to complement the   
 recently constructed vicarage. A fund 
 has been founded for this purpose     
 which is at present Â£25,000 short of  
 it's target.                          
     Activities connected with the     
 church include choir,Mothers union and
 Ladies Circle.
