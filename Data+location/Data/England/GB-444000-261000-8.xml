		<title>08NAPTON SHOW AND MILK RACE</title>
		<content> On Saturday May 25th I went to Napton 
 Show and I rode a black pony called   
 Bimbo. He is very hairy. There was a  
 lot of music and I won a rosette for  
 musical cans. We each had a can and we
 had to put it on one of the poles in  
 the middle. I was on a pony called Pop
 in the fancy dress, we were corn      
 dollies, and I won a rosette. We had a
 lolly pop and an ice cream and candy  
 floss.                                
 The Milk Race is an international     
 cycle race sponsored by the Milk      
 Marketing Board. It lasts for two     
 weeks and goes in stages all over     
 Britain. On Wednesday, Mum shot in the
 door and she said there is a crowd of 
 people. It was the Milk Race. There   
 were some hats too and there were     
 about 60 bikes.
