 Pelhams,the building which houses the 
 Centre is a large three storied       
 Georgian house built in 1793 by a     
 Mr.Tait.Amongst its prosperous owners 
 have been the infamous local smuggler 
 Isaac Gulliver,the Rolles Fryers who  
 were a Newfoundland merchant          
 family,and the Rev. Arnold Sharp a    
 descendant of the famous slave        
 emancipator.                          
   During the Second World War the     
 house was used by the Civil  defence  
 and was to be demolished.After repairs
 it was handed over to the Community   
 association in 1952.A full time warden
 was appointed in 1964 and several     
 extensions have been added to the     
 house.
