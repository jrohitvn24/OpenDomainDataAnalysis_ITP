		<content> St.Andrew's church was built in the   
 14th century by the Bourchier family  
 who lived at Stansted Hall. The{Bell  
{Tower}was built in 1848. There are 41 
 steps up and it is very steep. All the
 bells have names written on them in   
 Latin. In the tower there is a ringers
 jar, which the people who rang the    
 bells had, and they would go to people
 and ask for a drink. They would get a 
 mixture of drinks. There is a verse to
 go with it."If you be wise-fill me not
 twice-at one sitting." In the tower   
 there have been a lot of accidents.   
 Only 12 people can ring at once as    
 there are only 8 bells. The last time 
 the bell tower was cleaned was in     
 1957. The tower also houses the town  
 clock and this is wound up every other
 day. It chimes every quarter of an    
 hour. On Sundays 70 people go to the  
 services. There are 24 choir members. </content>
