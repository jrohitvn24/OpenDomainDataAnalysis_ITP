		<content> There are two main shops in           
 St.Germans. One is the village post   
 office, and the other a general store.
                                       
 The post office sells fruit,          
 vegetables and groceries as well as   
 papers and magazines, books and       
 stationery. The post office itself is 
 a separate counter within he shop,    
 open for most of the working day. It  
 is very important for old people from 
 the village who cannot easily travel  
 to Kings Lynn to draw pension money.  
                                       
 The other shop is a "Spar" shop -     
 linked to a purchasing group - which  
 sells all kinds of groceries.         
                                       
 Another small shop, which opens       
 occasionally, sells locally made craft
 articles, mainly made by the owner of 
 the shop.                             </content>
