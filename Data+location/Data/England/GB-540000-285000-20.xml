		<title>20Chatteris - Carnival Day</title>
		<content> On June 29th, 1985 Chatteris had a    
 parade.  The parade had ten floats and
 prizes were given for the best float  
 decoration.  The swimming club, The   
 Kingfishers had the members on their  
 float in T-shirts and track suits.    
 The children of the Peter Pan         
 Playgroup were all dressed up as      
 Mr Men at a tea party.                
                                       
 The Army Cadets, who were celebrating 
 their 75th Anniversary, had a green   
 scamble net hanging over the side of  
 their float and they gave a display of
 skills.                               
                                       
 The Gala Queen had a float.  One of   
 the winning floats was dressed up as  
 Fairyland with children in the        
 costumes of fairies and elves playing 
 in silver grass.  The day was full of 
 colour and fun.                       </content>
