		<title>18WETHERBY EDUCATION PROPOSALS</title>
		<content> Leeds Education Authority (Labour)    
 planned, in 1984, to incorporate the  
 6th forms in this area into a tertiary
 college in Leeds. The aims were to    
 increase falling 16+ participation    
 rates for educational and economic    
 reasons, to provide a flexible,       
 adaptable tertiary provision and to   
 provide equal openings in both        
 education and training.               
  Wetherby High School was included in 
 the plans but was opposed to them as  
 students would no longer be returning 
 to a familiar community. Also, longer 
 travel distances for Wetherby pupils  
 would exclude them from many extra-   
 curricular activities and the         
 impersonality of a large college would
 inhibit curriculum and pastoral       
 development. Consequently, the 1984   
 plan has been postponed to allow the  
 Authority to consider alternatives.   </content>
