		<title>04POPULATION IN PAXFORD AREA</title>
		<content> Area comprises part of Chipping       
 Campden,Broad Campden,Ebrington and   
 most of Paxford.It is estimated that  
 adults in the area total 450,children 
 and young persons under the age of 18 
 number approximately 50.As the area is
 part of four parishes,difficulty      
 arises in calculating precise         
 statistics.Deaths outnumber births and
 the ratio of young persons to adults  
 (1:9)is low in an aging population    
 with a trend towards smaller families.
 In a predominately farming community  
 one generation often succeeds another 
 resulting in a comparatively static   
 population.There has been some        
 movement into the district by older   
 retiring people who have helped to    
 restore and maintain properties which 
 otherwise might have remained         
 unoccupied.
