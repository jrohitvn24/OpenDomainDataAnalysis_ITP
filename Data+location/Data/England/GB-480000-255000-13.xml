		<title>13 A DENTON CRAFT ENTERPRISE</title>
		<content>(cont'd from P.12)                     
I made as many novelty and cheap items 
as my imagination allowed. I decided   
to offer to open the parties with a    
talk on the history and basic          
techniques behind one of the crafts,   
and this involved much research. These 
talks have proved to be very popular,  
and I hope that at least a few people  
have been introduced to a new hobby in 
this way.One of the most popular talks 
explains how to make beauty            
preparations from herbs and foods,and  
the guests particularly enjoy          
passing around some of the recipes.    
 Having persuaded a friend to give a   
party,I launched my business,and soon  
learned to do my Christmas shopping    
in the summer before the busy Autumn   
months.A friend now helps me to unload 
and sell the goods.
