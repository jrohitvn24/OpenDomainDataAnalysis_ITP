		<content> OUR SCHOOL - ALEX SMITH AGED 10       
    Our school is made of red-brick and
 is in two stories.  Classrooms are    
 quite large.  There are ten rooms but 
 some are used for storage and         
 resources.  At 9.55 the whistle goes  
 and we go to our classrooms.  I get my
 book from my locker.  Assembly comes  
 next which is often a story.          
 Classwork is varied.  We may read for 
 pleasure or do some practical work.   
 At present we are exploring the world 
 of plants and testing some seeds for  
 iodine.  At playtime we either go out 
 on the playground or field.  At       
 lunchtime I have a packed lunch.  Some
 pupils have a school dinner or go     
 home.  This is a poem I know about    
 school dinners:- "If you have school  
 dinners, you'd better chuck them      
 aside.  Some kids didn't.  Some kids  
 died!!!"                              </content>
