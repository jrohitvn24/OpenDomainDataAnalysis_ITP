		<content>{ Bassenthwaite village}is half a mile 
 from  the {A591,}on the N.W.fringe    
 of the{Lake District.}Mixed farming is
 the main occupation, along with some  
 forestry, but there is a growing      
 tourist trade,encouraging bed-and-    
 breakfast, hotels, and caravan sites. 
 The area around Bassenthwaite offers  
 woods, fells, waterfalls, streams,    
 rivers,and{Bassenthwaite Lake.}The    
 lake is one of the shallowest in the  
 Lake District, with sailing           
 facilities,walks by the shores, and an
 abundance of wild and animal life.    
 There is an infrequent bus service    
 along the A591, and the nearest       
 shopping centres are 7  miles         
 away.There is a travelling grocer's   
 van calling twice a week, a part-time 
 post office, and a school which is    
 rapidly growing smaller, as houses are
 bought for holiday homes.             </content>
