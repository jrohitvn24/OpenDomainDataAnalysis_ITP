 roofs have been built. Older members  
 of the community often live in        
 bungaloes with plated glass windows   
 overlooking the hills and valleys.    
 Some of these houses have wide glass  
 doors and double glazed windows.

 made from prefabricated steel uprights
 supporting corrugated iron roofs.     
 Glasshouses cover a wide area. Fine   
 old barns with honeycombed brick are  
 being converted into dwellings.

 blocks with arched windows. The former

 latticed windows. The village{garage

 while the much used village hall is
