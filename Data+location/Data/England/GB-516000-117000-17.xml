		<title>17PARTRIDGE GREEN'S GARAGE</title>
		<content> PRETTY'S GARAGE,now at the junction of
 HIGH STREET and CHURCH ROAD but once  
 on THE GREEN and called "THE CYCLISTS 
 SHOP",is a long established feature of
 Partridge Green.It has two PUMPS      
 supplying 2 and 4 STAR PETROL for CARS
 and a third used to supply LORRIES    
 with DIESEL/DERV.Spare car parts can  
 be bought and tyres filled with       
 air.Mechanics maintain and repair cars
 and Ministry of Transport Tests are   
 carried out.To attract more CUSTOMERS 
 the garage sells paraffin for         
 heaters,sweets,cigarettes and hires   
 out video cassettes.In spite of it's  
 attractions and friendly service it   
 not particularly well used by         
 villagers who because of infrequent   
 and expensive PUBLIC TRANSPORT nearly 
 all have their own vehicles.Perhaps it
 is because the petrol is not a well   
 known brand.                          </content>
