		<content>{The Keyham Educational Foundation}is a
 trust-fund consisting of sums of money
 bequeathed to the village at various  
 times over 100 years ago. The fund    
 exists to help young people living in 
 the village with any aspect of their  
 education. A sum of about Â£75 per     
 year may be given to a student at     
 University to help buy books; Â£40     
 could be given to a child to help     
 finance a school trip to France, and  
 so on.                                
                                       
{Keyham Relief in Need}is another      
 trust-fund set up to help people      
 facing financial hardship. Old people 
 in the village are given a grant to   
 help pay electricity bills.
