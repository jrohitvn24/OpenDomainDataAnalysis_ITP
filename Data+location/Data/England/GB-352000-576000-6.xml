		<content> The area is becoming increasingly     
 popular with tourists , perhaps       
 because the Lake District is often    
 rather crowded and the area around    
 Bewcastle remains a haven of peace,   
 with quiet roads and pleasant scenary 
 in addition to the historical         
 associations of the Bewcastle Cross   
 and Roman Fort.There are no hotels in 
 the area but several farms have       
 caravans which they rent out in       
 Summer, there are several             
 establishments on the edge of our     
 rectangle offering self-catering      
 accomodation and two cottages within  
 our survey are used as second-home,   
 holiday accomodation. The lack of a   
 through route probably means the area 
 will never become really popular      
 except with those who seek a          
 quiet,unspoiled spot in the country.
