		<title>04INTERVIEW WITH A FISHERMAN</title>
		<content>1.How long have you been fishing in    
these parts?                           
  Well I've been in the business all my
life.                                  
2.Are there as many mackeral in these  
parts as when you started?             
  Nowhere near. There was a time when  
you could catch a box of mackerel on   
each catch. That was about 20 years    
ago. They are much rarer now.          
3.How much did this boat cost?         
  It was built in 1928 and rebuilt in  
1962 so its been going for a long time.
4.What was your biggest catch?         
  This was once used to catch herring  
and you could catch 30,000 at a time.  
5.Why is this area called Mackerel     
Cove?                                  
  It is called Mackerel Cove because it
is the only cove where you could be    
sure of catching mackerel.
