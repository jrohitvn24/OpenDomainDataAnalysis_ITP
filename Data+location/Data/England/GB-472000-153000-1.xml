		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content>      The block is mainly of arable and
 grazing land with transport lines to  
 London and Southampton via the railway
 and M3. The area is dominated by the  
 village of Hook which has been        
 designated an area for planned housing
 growth despite local resistance.      
    Living standards in the area are   
 high with low people to house ratios, 
 particularly in Hook. Housing is      
 mainly estates of two storey detatched
 and semi-detatched houses.            
    Because of good transport links    
 employment is generally outside the   
 area but some industry, taking        
 advantage of the transport lines,is   
 found on an industrial estate in Hook.
    Poor commercial and leisure        
 facilities in the area means that the 
 focus of recreation and shopping is   
 also outside the area in Basingstoke, 
 Fleet or Hartley Wintney.             </content>
