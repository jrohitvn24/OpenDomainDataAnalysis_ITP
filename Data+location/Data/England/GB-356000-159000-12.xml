		<title>12STOWEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The old face of Stowey is slowly      
 disappearing. The cottages are being  
 modernised, but still retain the      
 character of the village.Twenty-six   
 families live in Stowey of whom half  
 have lived and worked there for more  
 than twenty-five years.Few people     
 commute to Bristol or Bath and many   
 work locally and are connected with   
 the land. Everyone supports the Annual
 Harvest Suppers and the Barbecues in  
 the Henry Strachey Memorial Hall which
 raises money for the Church. Apart    
 from Festivals,few local people       
 regularly attend services. Heavy      
 traffic now spoils the peace of the   
 village and plans in hand for the     
 development of Sutton Court and the   
 Estate, now in a state of disrepair,  
 mean many changes in the future.
