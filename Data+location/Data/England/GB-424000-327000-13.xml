		<title>13EGGINTON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Egginton School is a small            
 village                               
 school in the country. On average     
 there are about 50 pupils. There are  
 three teachers and the Head teaches a 
 class too. The school building is also
 a memorial hall and lots of different 
 people use it. The school was built in
 1857. There is an Infant, a lower     
 junior and an upper junior class.     
 Recently a terrapin building has been 
 put up.                               
 There is one main road that goes      
 through the village and the school is 
 on that road. We have a hard          
 playground with hawthorn trees and    
 hedges around the school. There is a  
 post office attached to the school and
 the caretaker lives there.
