   On Sunday 14 October 1804 John Brown
 went to Hythe. On the way he stopped  
 at the Star Inn in Maidstone. John    
 Brown met the contractors and went to 
 the White Inn to dine. This is how the
 building of the{Royal Military Canal  
 was first planned. The Royal Military 
 Canal was built in the Napoleonic     
 War. The promoter was{William Pitt.   
{                                      
{ }They built the canal because the    
 enemies would not be able to get over 
 it so the people were safe. It was    
 sixty feet wide at the top and forty  
 at the bottom and nine feet deep. The 
 Canal is now used for boats. The Canal
 is very muddy and weedy and looks     
 dirty. The Canal is pretty to walk    
 along. Many people fish in the Canal.
