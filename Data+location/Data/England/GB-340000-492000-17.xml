		<content> There are a few small sites for       
 touring caravans, where farms may take
 a maximum of 6 on their fields at any 
 time, but Bellman Ground has an       
 unusual layout. The static caravans   
 are all painted shades of green, are  
 placed in clearings between the trees,
 and merge in to the landscape as      
 advised by the planning authority. Hot
 air ballooning is a recent development
 in the last two decades, and has      
 become a lakeland sport. It so happens
 that these are launched at a distance 
 of approximately 10 miles from the SW,
 the valley is in the flight path, so  
 the local rallies and races of these  
 give great enjoyment to those on the  
 ground. Fell walking has now become   
 very popular on all paths and         
 bridleways.
