		<title>07FARMING AROUND MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>     Large areas on the hills west of  
 Mitcheldean are forests, with some    
 rough grazing for sheep on land       
 disturbed by old mine workings. There 
 are few farms in this area, and the   
 usable land is mostly pasture. The    
 more intensive farming is confined to 
 the area south and east of            
 Mitcheldean. Here there is a mixed    
 type of farming, with pasture and     
 cereal crops, mostly barley. Cattle   
 are kept, with sheep on the steeper   
 parts of the sandstone ridges. The    
 older farm buildings are of local     
 stone, and in a few places large stone
 barns survive on the hills, isolated  
 from the farms themselves, and used in
 the past for winter shelter and food  
 storage.
