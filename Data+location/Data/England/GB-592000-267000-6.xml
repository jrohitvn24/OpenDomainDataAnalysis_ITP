		<title>06Ixworth Archaeological Dig</title>
		<content>When the new Ixworth Bypass was planned
the route went over a known Roman site.
The builders allowed local archae-     
ologists some months in which to       
excavate the part of the site which    
would be destroyed by the road.Jane    
wrote the following after our visit:   
 On Thursday we went to the Ixworth    
Dig.The Lady showed us an aerial       
picture of the Roman village and it    
had three lines in it.The lines were   
the Roman Roads that went round the    
village.The Lady showed us the dark    
circles which was all that was left of 
the houses.They had also found a ditch 
which was part of the fort.A Roman     
kiln had been found.We were allowed to 
search the soil tips.We found many     
animal bones and oyster shells.We also 
found several bits of pottery.Ross     
found a piece that was too good to     
keep.The lady  kept it.                </content>
