		<content> Viewed from the highest vantage point 
 there is little to be seen of any ind_
 ustry within this block. (see slide 1)
 Apart from a small privately owned    
 drift at Newfield the traditional coal
 mining has gone. On the eastern bound_
 ary can be seen a coal storage/washing
 depot,&amp; at Binchester Blocks a chapel 
 has been converted to the manufacture 
 of leather gloves (previously a pyjama
 factory). Such chapels, deconsecrated,
 seem to be the focus for small firms  
 coming into the area, e.g. a similar  
 empty chapel at Newfield may become a 
 mushroom farm.                        
 It is at Newfield/Todhills we still   
 see larger industries; quarrying the  
 river banks for the raw materials re_ 
 quired by the large brickworks at Tod_
 hills. Hereabouts, the river flats are
 used for tipping waste and there is a 
 sewage disposal plant.                </content>
