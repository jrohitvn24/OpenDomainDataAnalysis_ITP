		<content> 'The Station' derives its name from   
 the the former adjacent Horsehay      
 railway station. This was closed in   
 the early sixties, though some of the 
 rail tracks still remain and a steam  
 trust has been set-up with the aim of 
 restoring the station and running a   
 steam train service to the former next
 station south at Lightmoor, about 2km 
 away.                                 
 The 'All Labour in Vain', has an      
 unusual pub sign, with a little black 
 boy being scrubbed clean. The origins 
 of this sign are unknown, though it   
 may have something to do with the     
 former mining community and the ritual
 of the miner's bath. The pub was once 
 'John Bull's' local (See William      
 Ball). Now it is famous for its food  
 and snacks; one is just as likely to  
 meet a Japanese employee from Maxell  
 or a visiting European businesssman   </content>
