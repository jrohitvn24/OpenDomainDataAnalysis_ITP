		<title>03     MACKEREL FISHING</title>
		<content>   On Wednesday 3rd.July 1985 part of  
Trinity School went mackerel fishing on
the boat "Britannia",skippered by Jim  
Mattews.We started off at 0945 putting 
out into Teignmouth Bay where the water
was about forty feet deep.We fished off
Mackerel Cove which is the only place  
between Teignmouth and Babbacombe where
a net can be cast from the shore       
without being fouled by the rocks.The  
tackel consisted of rods which had     
five or six hooks and were lead-       
weighted.                              
  Jim had been fishing all his life, as
had also his father.There are not as   
many mackerel as formerly despite the  
multitude of plankton,which has caused 
an increase in their price.            
  Jim's business slackens in the winter
when he only reckons to take small     
groups of local anglers deep-sea       
fishing for fish such as conger eels.  </content>
