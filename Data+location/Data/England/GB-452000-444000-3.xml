 The Repair of the Fairfax Tomb.       
 A notable event this year has been the
 repair of the tomb of Sir Thomas      
 Fairfax, the Parliamentary Commander  
 in the Civil War.Black Tom fought with
 Cromwell against the King at the      
 Battle of Marston Moor,when the       
 Royalists were defeated, but later he 
 helped to restore the Monarchy after  
 the death of Cromwell.                
 His tomb in Bilbrough church had      
 crumbled and deteriorated over the    
 years, and there was no government    
 grant to help to pay for the          
 repair.Lots of donations have been    
 received, and there have been many    
 functions to raise money.             
 Masons came from York Minster to do   
 the work.
