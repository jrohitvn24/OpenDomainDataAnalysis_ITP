		<title>08The Grampound Fete</title>
		<content>  There are several fetes held in the  
 village through the year.All the      
 organisations try to raise money by   
 having a fete.The biggest fete is the 
 village fete.This is when all the     
 clubs join together to raise money for
 the village hall.The hall is used for 
 lots of things.The Brownies meet there
 and the over 60 club.                 
  Each club runs a stall.The school has
 a different stall every year.The      
 football club always has a bottle     
 stall.At a bottle stall you buy       
 tickets and hope the ticket has a 5 at
 the end of its number.If it has a 5   
 you win a prize.If I win it is usually
 bottle of sauce but I would like to   
 win a bottle of whisky to give to my  
 Dad.The other stalls are cake stall,  
 plant stall, book stall, hoop-la,     
 treasure hunt, bric-a-brac and        
 refreshments.                         </content>
