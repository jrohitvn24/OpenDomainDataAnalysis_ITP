		<content> A wide selection of crafts is pract-  
 ised in these parishes,from very high 
 quality embroidery to the repair of   
 old violins &amp; making wooden toys;an   
 above average skill at sewing,dress-  
 making,soft-toy making,furniture reno-
 vation,reupholstery &amp; in all branches 
 of cookery &amp; catering is to be found.1
 young girl can ice a fine wedding cake
 &amp; several wives bake their own bread; 
 in fact one can dine far better in a  
 friend's home than in many a restau-  
 rant! The average countryman is a     
 competent &amp; experienced gardener as   
 often is his wife,&amp; incomers too gar- 
 den to a high standard,often having a 
 wide knowledge of plants.             
 Local W.I. markets encourage the pro- 
 duction of crafts &amp; plants by         
 providing an outlet for their sale,   
 from which young mothers &amp; pensioners 
 alike,can supplement their incomes.   </content>
