		<title>15Quaker Farm, Spixworth</title>
		<content> This farm lies on the outer fringes   
of the area and in part of the larger  
Grange Farm Estate. The Crook family   
who farmed it came to Spixworth in     
1943 to combine general farming with   
poultry keeping. The free range flock  
was especially suitable for the light  
land in Spixworth. Gradually the farm  
was increased to its present size of   
750 acres plus a further 140 acres of  
hired land. The emphasis of the farm   
has changed over the years with the    
expansion of the dairy herd and by     
investment in a modern milking parlour 
and cow buildings.                     
 {The Dairy Unit} This was started with
about 20 mixed cows hand milked in '42 
and now is made up of 300 Friesian     
cows. They are milked in a rotary      
herringbone parlour,each giving 1300   
gallons on average each year.
