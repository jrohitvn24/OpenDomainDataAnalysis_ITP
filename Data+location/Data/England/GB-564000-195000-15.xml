		<content>   In{Lake Meadows}there are many      
 attractions for leisure activities.   
   A sloping area is utilised as a     
 9_hole golf course and a small 'crazy 
 golf' area has been constructed near a
 well_maintained bowling green. The    
 local hockey pitch is also situated   
 close by. The lake itself is an       
 attraction to fishermen, and an       
 enclosed area is set aside for paddle 
 boats. Tennis courts cater for the    
 more energetic.                       
   There is an area put aside for      
 children where swings, slides,        
 roundabout and climbing frames have   
 been erected. Overlooking this play   
 area is a{cafeteria,}first aid post   
 and{toilets.}                         
   The whole area is tastefully        
 landscaped with shrubs,lawns and      
 gardens. Numerous wild fowl inhabit   
 the islands in the lake.              </content>
