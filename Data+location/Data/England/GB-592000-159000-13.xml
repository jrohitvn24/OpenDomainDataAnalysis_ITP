		<title>13HOP FARMING IN LYNSTED  (2)</title>
		<content> Nowadays the casual labour needed is  
 found locally. Londoners used to come 
 hoppicking. They lived in hopper huts.
 For many people it was the annual     
 holiday. In our school log we saw that
 they used to start school in late     
 September because all the children    
 used to work in the fields. Years ago 
 three boys were beaten for cutting the
 hop strings on their way to school.   
 Hops are a climbing plant. Their      
 colour is green. Each plant can       
 provide half a pint of stout. The hops
 have to be crushed. Nowadays the      
 machines used are great big carriers  
 that carry the hops into the shed. The
 hops are pulled out by metal arms and 
 put onto a conveyor belt, which puts  
 them through the shredder. Then they  
 are carried into the oast houses. All 
 this equipment is very expensive so it
 is very well-cared for &amp; well greased.</content>
