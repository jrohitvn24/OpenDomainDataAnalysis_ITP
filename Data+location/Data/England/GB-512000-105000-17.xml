		<title>17DURRINGTON-ITS PASTOR'S VIEW</title>
		<content> To all outward appearances,Durrington 
 is a sedate,predominantly retired     
 community to the North-West of        
 Worthing,sitting snugly in the lie of 
 the Downs.Despite its absorption into 
 the Greater Worthing Area,Durrington  
 retains some of its identity and      
 village atmosphere,adding to the      
 picture of serenity and peace.        
 Beneath the image,however,all is not  
 well with Durrington.Its people are   
 caught in the dangers of the age.All  
 too many families are hiding,breaking 
 hearts and relationships beneath the  
 veneer of respectability.Husbands and 
 wives,parents and children failing to 
 find love and fulfillness used to     
 their own pursuits of happiness.The   
 result? A community where family life 
 is,for all too many,breaking down.Hope
 for Durrington lies in the church's   
 age-old message of reconciliation.    </content>
