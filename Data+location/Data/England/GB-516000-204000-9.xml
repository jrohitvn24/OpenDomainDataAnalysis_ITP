		<content> When you go through the main entrance 
 at the front of the building, you go  
 past the offices of the headmistress  
 and the secretary. Then you are in the
 main corridor. To the left is the     
 stock room, staff toilets, library,   
 welfare room and the dining room. To  
 the right is the security cupboard,   
 staff room, infants' toilets, door to 
 the playground, 3 infants' classrooms 
 and the caretaker's room. This is the 
 old part of the school.               
  Opposite the dining room door is the 
 beginning of the new school buildings.
 There is the hall, a separate nursery 
 unit, and a block of 4 classrooms.    
 Each pair of junior classrooms has an 
 art area, a stock cupboard, an extra  
 room and toilets. At the back of the  
 school is a large field surrounded by 
 trees and a fence. There is a brick   
 adventure wall and a wild garden area.</content>
