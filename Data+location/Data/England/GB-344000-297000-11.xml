		<content>  One local farm has extended its      
 interests to include a large boarding 
 kennels and cattery,whilst another has
 two holiday cottages to let.There are 
 three small caravan sites on various  
 farms and one beautiful 15th Century  
 farmhouse offers Bed &amp; Breakfast      
 accommodation.                        
  A scrapyard and a comprehensive      
 builders' supplies store offer some   
 employment,a welcome change in an area
 that has seen the closure of the rail-
 way station and the decline of the    
 local brickmaking industry.Coalmining,
 now a thing of the past here,not only 
 provided much needed jobs but also    
 fuel for the villagers.               
  The village of Woolstaston is home to
 a talented potter.A lovely old barn is
 now her workshop and the finished     
 products are sold through an interior 
 designer in London.                   </content>
