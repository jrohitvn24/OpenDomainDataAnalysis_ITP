		<title>03ALTON TOWERS</title>
		<content>     Hello, my name is Sarah. On Sunday
 my family and I went to Alton Towers. 
 Alton Towers is a recreation park in  
 Staffordshire. It was fantastic. First
 of all we went on the cable cars.     
 These hang from a cable about 80 feet 
 in the air. I was terrified when it   
 first started to move. There were many
 American tourists there as well as    
 people from all over Britain.         
     Next we went to the{3D}film show. 
 They showed a film of an elephant     
 standing on its hind legs. It was     
 about to get back on all fours and it 
 looked so real that we thought it was 
 going to crush us.                    
     I had a go on the Log Flumes, the 
 roller-coaster, the Magic Carpet, the 
 Dragon roller-coaster, and the Big    
 Wheel. I then bought a giant sweet    
 dummy and a book of Alton Towers. We  
 went home at about 5 o'clock.         </content>
