 Home life is based on nuclear families
 and there is a mixture of new families
 from outside the area and long        
 established families.  School children
 are bussed to Gilmorton junior school 
 and senior children to Lutterworth.   
 Different types of energy are used    
 i.e. oil, electricity, coal and wood. 
 There is no gas in the area.          
 Most households have pets such as     
 cats, dogs and horses, some of which  
 are used as working animals such as   
 dogs for shepherding and shooting;    
 horses are used for hunting as the    
 Atherstone and Fernie Hunts pass      
 through and occasionally meet here.   
 Shopping is done in nearby towns and  
 cities.  The residents are keen       
 gardeners and produce a lot of home   
 grown fruit and vegetables for home   
 consumption.                          </content>
