		<title>09Employment in Newent</title>
		<content>  The pattern of employment has changed
 rapidly over the years since World War
 II and this has changed the nature of 
 Newent from that of a market town to a
 modern town that is generally one of a
 residential and some would say a      
 dormitory town with employment outside
 the area.                             
  Many people now work in Gloucester   
 and Cheltenham and a significant      
 number travel to Mitcheldean where    
 they work in the large Rank-Xerox     
 factory.                              
  Some work in local agriculture as in 
 former days and the horticultural     
 industry gives seasonal employment.   
  The private and local council estates
 that are being built together with the
 local saw mill and ladder works are   
 the major employers. There are moves  
 to attract light industry to the area 
 to combat the rise in unemployment.   </content>
