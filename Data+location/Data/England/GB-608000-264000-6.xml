There are a lot of clubs in Mendlesham.
These are some of them.                
BOWLS CLUB                             
They have their green opposite the     
playing field.  The club has about     
forty members made up of men and       
ladies.  They play on Monday evenings.A
team of twelve play in blocks of       
four.  There are three players in each 
block.  Each player plays with two     
bowls.  The club is in the Stowmarket  
league.  There is no age limit for     
members.                               
DARTS CLUB                             
This comes from the public house team  
which is made up of nine players and   
they play teams from other public      
houses mostly in the winter months.    
Unlike bowls they do not have a mixed  
team but they do have a separate ladies
team.                                  </content>
