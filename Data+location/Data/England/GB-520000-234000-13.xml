		<content> The flowers and shrubs nursery on the 
 Hitchin-Stotfold road has about 2O,OOO
 plants and shrubs grown and looked    
 after by a team of three men.  They   
 are employed by The North Herts Urban 
 District Council Parks and Recreation 
 Department and are responsible for    
 providing and maintaining all the     
 flowers, shrubs and trees we see      
 around Letchworth - which is a very   
 big job.                              
 The flowers and shrubs are grown in 5 
 glasshouses and in the open on 2.5    
 acres of land.In the roundabouts at   
 junctions of roads in Letchworth these
 are always made very attractive by    
 being planted with hundreds of        
 brightly coloured bedding plants.     
 Another job the nurserymen do is to   
 provide floral displays for special   
 events outside the town'S Public      
 Buildings.                            </content>
