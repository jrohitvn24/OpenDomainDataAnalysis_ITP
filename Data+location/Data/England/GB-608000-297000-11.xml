		<title>11INDUSTRY IN SPOONER ROAD</title>
		<content> A group of six children went to       
 Folliards Hydraulics factory in       
 Spooner Row. The factory is situated  
 near the railway station and makes    
 hydraulics for machines. The factory  
 has been here for 15 months, before   
 that it was in Wymondham. It employs  
 13 people. The owner showed us round  
 the factory. First of all we went into
 the drawing office where they take the
 orders, then someone has to draw what 
 is needed. Then a list of parts is    
 made and they are obtained from the   
 stores. If a certain part is not      
 available then it is sometimes made in
 the factory. One machine in the       
 factory has to be restored as it is   
 very old and the owner would like to  
 replace it. The people in the factory 
 work from 7.30am - 5.30pm.
