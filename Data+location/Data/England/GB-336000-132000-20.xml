		<content> In the North-East of the block along  
 the banks of the King's Sedgemoor     
 Drain one can usually see anglers. The
 most common fish are Perch and Pike   
 which because they need to be able to 
 see their prey avoid opaque muddy     
 water. The state of the other rivers  
 and drains is such that these fish are
 not found in them. However bottom     
 feeding fish are quite common. Tench  
 thrives particularly where there is   
 rich aquatic plant life. In spring    
 vast numbers of elvers enter the      
 Severn Estuary and make their way up  
 the rivers. They are about 7cm long   
 and 3 years old. If they are not      
 caught (they are a local delicacy)    
 they move out into all the rhines     
 feeding on worms and whatever aquatic 
 lifeforms they can find. The males    
 grow to 60cms and the females to 150  
 cms.                                  </content>
