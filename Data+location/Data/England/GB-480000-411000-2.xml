		<content> this area include cereals,i.e.wheat,  
 barley, oil-seed rape and vegetables  
 i.e. potatoes, broad beans, and peas. 
 The peas are grown on contract for    
 freezer processing firms in Grimsby   
 54km.away on the East coast.          
      The drainage system is now used  
 to drain excess water from the land   
 and to provide water during the summer
 months for irrigation and fertiliser  
 spraying.The drains are managed by    
 Crowle Internal Drainage Board.The    
 smaller field drains are maintained by
 the farmers themselves and can be     
 infilled if so desired without contact
 with the Board. The drains were once  
 full of wildlife but now only a few   
 solitary Mayflowers grow against the  
 bank and a few ducks nest on the      
 quieter banks.This is due to the      
 increasing use of artificial          
 fertilisers.                          </content>
