 Every weekday morning a coach         
 comes to the bus shelter in Great     
 Asby.All secondary school pupils take 
 this coach from Asby to Appleby       
 Grammar School(Asby has its own       
 village school),the bus brings them   
 back at 4.30pm.A lady in Asby ferries 
 the children from outlying dwellings  
 to and from Asby for school.She does  
 the same with the children that go to 
 Asby School(if they live at least 3   
 miles away).In Great Asby we are very 
 cut off,it is essential to have a     
 car.Quiet alot of people have Range   
 Rovers,and most of the farmers have   
 Landrovers.Apart from a mini bus      
 that comes from Appleby on Saturdays  
 we have no other means of transport.
