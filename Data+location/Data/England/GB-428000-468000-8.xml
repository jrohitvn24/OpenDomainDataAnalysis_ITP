		<title>08The Queen goes by.</title>
		<content> On the fourth of April 1985, the      
 Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh came  
 to Ripon so that the Queen could give 
 the Maundy money to 59 men and 59     
 women. We waited at the bottom of     
 Claro Road from about half past ten.  
 There was Grandad, Grandma, Dad, Mum, 
 Peter, and me.The car came past       
 at five minutes to eleven. It was very
 big black car and it had very big     
 windows so that you                   
 could get a good view of them.The     
 Queen was dressed in a blue coat and  
 blue hat. When they passed by we waved
 at them and they waved back at us.    
 After they passed by they went to the 
 Cathedral for the ceremony which      
 started at eleven o clock.
