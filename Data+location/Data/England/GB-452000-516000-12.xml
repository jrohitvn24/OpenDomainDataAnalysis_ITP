		<title>12Ormesby Public Library</title>
		<content> The library in Ormesby is very handy  
 because it is not far from anybody.   
 The books are quite good if you need  
 any information. There is a fairly    
 good selection of books for 2year olds
 to any age. There is a section for    
 little children and most of the books 
 are interesting, Iknow because when   
 they find a book they like they go    
 quiet. In the daytime from 11.30a.m   
 until 12.30 p.m. there is a playgroup.
 The smaal children can play, paint or 
 play with the toys.                   
 The adult section in the library has  
 at least 900 books and there is a     
 reference section.The library has the 
 daily newspaper so that people may    
 read the news without having to buy a 
 paper.There are also bus and rail     
 timetables and posters showing local  
 events and organisations.
