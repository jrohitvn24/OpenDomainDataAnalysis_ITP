		<title>12THE QUILTERY, TACOLNESTON</title>
		<content> The Victorian stable block behind     
 Tacolneston Hall became well-known in 
 the late 70's when the Quiltery was   
 founded. From here handsewn quilts,   
 cushions &amp; patchwork kits were        
 distributed worldwide.                
 In 10 years the business has changed  
 considerably.No more handsewn products
 are made here,however the brand name  
{"The Quiltery"}is found on wellknown  
 patchwork &amp; quilting patterns together
 with a picture of the building.These  
 are distributed to shops throughout   
 the country.The stable building is    
 also the headquarters of the{National 
{Patchwork Championships,}an annual    
 event,held at country houses.This     
 event attempts to retain the original 
 rural atmosphere created at           
 Tacolneston where the first quilt     
 exhibitions were hung out on the      
 washing line.                         </content>
