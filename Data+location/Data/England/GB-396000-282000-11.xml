		<title>11Halesowen Football Team</title>
		<content>    On Saturday 27th of April 1985,    
 Halesowen Town Football Team went to  
 Wembley to play in the F.A.Vase       
 against Fleetwood Town. Thousands of  
 fans went to support their local team.
 There was great tension as they kicked
 off at three o'clock. Halesowen       
 started the match strongly and within 
 ten minutes Geff Moss scored          
 Halesowen's first goal. Then we       
 completely took over and on fifty and 
 eighty minutes Lee Joinsen scored     
 Halesowen's second  and third goals.  
 Fleetwood scored a late consolation   
 goal and there was great jubilation at
 the final whistle. This made up for   
 the defeat in 1983 against V.S.Rugby  
 when Rugby's goal was off-side.
