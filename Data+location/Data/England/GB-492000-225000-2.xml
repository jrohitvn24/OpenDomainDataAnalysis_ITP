		<content>  The area has a three tier educational
 system comprising lower (5-8+ years)  
 middle (9-13+ years) and upper (14-18 
 years) schools. The upper school is   
 also designated a community college,  
 providing education for examination   
 and leisure for those who seek it in  
 the community at large, in addition to
 its function as a school for the      
 compulsory age group to 16 years old, 
 and also providing a sixth form       
 education for the 16-18 year olds who 
 wish to further their education.      
  The area has ten schools, 7 lower, 2 
 middle and one upper. They are        
 concentrated in an area approximately 
 one third of the whole area,          
 indicating the concentration of       
 population in the area. Each school   
 designs its own curriculum in         
 accordance with guidelines from the   
 Bedfordshire Education Authority.     </content>
