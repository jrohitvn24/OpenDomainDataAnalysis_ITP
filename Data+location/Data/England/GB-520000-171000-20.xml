		<content>MANRESA HOUSE is part of Garnett       
College which provides courses for     
teachers of students aged 16 and over. 
Manresa House, designed 1760, stands in
12 acres of grounds overlooking        
Richmond Park. It has teaching rooms   
and sports facilities. Students reside 
in single study-bedrooms in the finely 
appointed 18th century house called    
Mount Clare (1772) in Minstead Gardens,
and also in an adjoining modern annex. 
MANRESA HOUSE also houses the local    
Adult Education Institute. This        
provides a large variety of vocational 
and leisure courses for the general    
public. Some courses take place in     
another building on the housing estate 
called the Alton Centre where there    
are Playgroup and Creche facilities.   
The aim is to attract socially deprived
people in order to enrich their lives  
by companionship and education.        </content>
