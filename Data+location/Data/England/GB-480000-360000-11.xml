 a very busy line and well used by many
 of the village people.The fare from

 There are local{bus services}to Newark
 Lincoln and Nottingham and there is   
 even a bus from Lincoln to Manchester 
 which calls in at Collingham.A small  
 bus company is based in the village,  
 hiring out to schools and clubs and   
 running holiday tours both at home and
 abroad.
