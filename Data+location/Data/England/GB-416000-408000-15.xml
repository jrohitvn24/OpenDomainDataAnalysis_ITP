		<title>15Thurstonland Church.</title>
		<content> St. Thomas's Church was built in 1870.
 It shares its vicar with Christ Church
 New Mill.Services are on three out of 
 four Sundays monthly.The church spire 
 is a well-known local landmark.The    
 dioceson architects have decided it   
 needs a thorough renovation.The       
 roof,guttering,wiring,heating and     
 decorating all need urgent            
 attention.It is estimated that Â£8,000 
 will be needed and a target date of   
 May 1988 has been set.At present about
 Â£2,000 has been raised.The committee  
 co-ordinates fund raising             
 efforts.These efforts are purely      
 voluntary.They range from individuals 
 holding parties and coffee mornings to
 grander events organised by the       
 school(cycle ride)and the Clothiers   
 Public House(Harvest Festival).These  
 events bring the community together.
