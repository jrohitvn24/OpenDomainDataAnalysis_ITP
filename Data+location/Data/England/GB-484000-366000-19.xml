		<title>19THE GRAVEL PITS</title>
		<content>   Around North Scarle and Eagle there 
 are a lot of Gravel pits.Some are     
 disused now but most are still worked.
 The sand and gravel is dug out for the
 building trade.                       
  The farmers sell the mineral rights  
 to the gravel Firms who then dig out  
 all the sand and gravel.The power     
 stations from across the Trent, dump  
 all their ash from the furnaces in the
 disused pits.When they are full.The   
 old soil which has been saved,is put  
 over all the ash and the farmer then  
 grows his crops on the reclaimed land.
   Some of the disused gravel pits  are
 bought by water sports clubs and are  
 used for sailing, wind surfing,fishing
 and water skiing They are very        
 dangerous places and we are warned not
 to go near.We all learn to swim at    
 school.
