		<content>   {"Saturday"} by Hannah Cleveland.   
 The family gets up at about 8.45 and  
 once they have had a wash and got     
 dressed we all go downstairs and have 
 breakfast which is cereals and toast. 
 We go shopping next and buy all the   
 food for the week,and then go into a  
 cafe for a drink and snack.When we get
 back we have a sandwich and watch the 
 sport on T.V. In the afternoon after  
 the house work we go for a walk down  
 the canal and see the boats coming    
 through the locks. When we get back it
 is time for tea which is fish and     
 chips from the chip shop, with apple  
 pie to follow. After tea we all sit in
 front of the T.V. which we watch until
 we play cards.After that we go to bed 
 and get to sleep if we can!
