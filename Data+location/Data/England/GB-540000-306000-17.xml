		<title>17RAILWAYMAN</title>
		<content>    Mr.Wright came to Wisbech St.Mary  
 in 1930 to work on the railway as a   
 porter and later a signalman.         
    The railway employed probably the  
 most village people in the early      
 days with about a dozen extra hands   
 taken on in the strawberry and plum   
 season. In those days as many as 100  
 wagons a day were sent away full of   
 strawberries or plums.                
    There were a few lorries and motor 
 cars but mainly people brought their  
 fruit on trailers,wheelbarrows,prams, 
 even yokes on their shoulders made    
 especially to carry about 12 chips.At 
 about 3.30am they would be queing as  
 far back as the church waiting to be  
 unloaded.                             
    His wages were only Â£2.0.0d.per    
 week but that was better than a farm  
 labourer who only earned about 28/4d. 
 per week.                             </content>
