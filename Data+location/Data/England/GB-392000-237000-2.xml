		<title>02OVERBURY VILLAGE ON BREDON</title>
		<content> Overbury is one of the villages on    
 Bredon Hill.Most of the houses in     
 Overbury are made of Cotswold Stone   
 and belong to the Overbury Estate     
 which is owned by the Holland-Martin  
 family.In Overbury there is a{Norman  
{Church called St.Faith's.}By the      
 church is a very big house called     
{Overbury Court}which was built 250    
 years ago.In Overbury there are two   
 schools, The Red House School,a       
 private school which is closing down  
 this term, and{Overbury C.E.First     
{School,}which I go to.The houses in   
 Overbury are different from those in  
{Kemerton}being nearly all of stone.   
 Overbury has one Post Office and Shop.
 There is a big Playing Field. At the  
 top of Overbury is a very big Park.It 
 is used for grazing animals and is    
 open to the public.There are many     
 splendid trees around the village.    </content>
