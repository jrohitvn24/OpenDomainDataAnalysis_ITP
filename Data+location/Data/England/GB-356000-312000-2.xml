		<content>{RODINGTON VILLAGE }IS A  SMALL  PLACE.
 IT HAS FEW PEOPLE.  IT HAS A          
{POPULATION OF 564,}BUT IT IS BIG IN   
 THE WAY THE HOUSES ARE SPREAD OUT.FROM
 ONE END OF THE VILLAGE TO THE OTHER   
 END WOULD BE ABOUT THREE MILES. IN    
 RODINGTON WE HAVE A{SHOP.}IT IS ALSO A
 POST OFFICE.  WE HAVE A{PUB,}IT IS    
 OPPOSITE THE SHOP. IT OPENS EVERY DAY.
 WE HAVE A{CHURCH,}IT IS A CHURCH OF   
 ENGLAND CHURCH.   IT IS CALLED ST.    
 GEORGE'S CHURCH.  THE CHURCH DOESN'T  
 REALLY BELONG TO ANY ONE EXCEPT GOD.  
 THE{VILLAGE HALL}IS OWNED BY THE      
 VILLAGE AND IT IS USED BY EVERYBODY   
 WHO LIVES IN THE VILLAGE. THERE IS A  
 SMALL{SCHOOL}FOR CHILDREN FROM THE AGE
 OF FIVE TO ELEVEN. THE GOOD THING     
 ABOUT RODINGTON IS THAT IT HAS LOTS OF
 COUNTRYSIDE AND SPACE SO IT IS NICE   
 AND PEACEFUL AND YOU HAVE NOT GOT ALL 
 THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF THE TOWN.    </content>
