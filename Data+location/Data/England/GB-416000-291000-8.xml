		<content> CURDWORTH, 2 MILES BEYOND BIRMINGHAM'S
 EASTERN BOUNDARY IS SURROUNDED BY FLAT
 OPEN LAND WHICH IS INTENSIVELY FARMED.
 THE LESS FERTILE LAND TO THE SOUTH IS 
 USED FOR GRAZING DAIRY AND BEEF CATTLE
 AND PASTURAGE FOR LOCAL RIDERS HORSES.
 THE REMAINING LAND, CULTIVATED BY     
 SEVERAL LOCAL FARMERS, IS DEVOTED TO  
 PRODUCING WHEAT AND BARLEY 60%,       
 POTATOES, CABBAGES AND SPROUTS 18%,   
 RAPE 6% AND HAY 16%. MODERN HIGHLY    
 EFFICIENT METHODS FOR CROP SPRAYING,  
 PLANTING AND HARVESTING USED. THE     
 CEREAL CROPS ARE OVERWINTERED, THUS   
 ENABLING HARVESTING DURING THE SUMMER 
 MONTHS OF JULY AND AUGUST. THE SOIL   
 BEING OF A SANDY NATURE NECESSITATES  
 CONSIDERABLE ARTIFICIAL WATERING      
 DURING DRY PERIODS. A PORTION OF THE  
 FARMLAND WAS RECENTLY TAKEN FOR THE   
 CONSTRUCTION OF THE M42 MOTORWAY BUT  
 THE LAND LOST WAS LESS FERTILE NATURE.</content>
