		<title>18WETHERBY STAINED GLASS</title>
		<content>  As we approached the door we could   
 see panes of glass leant against the  
 wall. There was a wooden staircase    
 that was went up the right hand side  
 of the room. This room was very small.
 As you went up the stairs there were a
 few pictures hung on the wall. As you 
 get to the top of the stairs you can  
 see a workbench and pamphlets about   
 the glass and a cash till. The        
 thickness of the glass depends on what
 it is used for e.g. 4mm glass is used 
 mostly for windows, 3mm is used mostly
 for greenhouses and churches and 2mm  
 is used for patterned glass. They mend
 all stained glass upstairs and all    
 normal glass downstairs. The shapes of
 glass are fastened with either lead or
 copper strips, soldered and puttied.  
 They also made novelty toys and       
 lampshades.
