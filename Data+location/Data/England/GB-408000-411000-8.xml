 school.During Lent the children go to 
 church every Wednesday.Every Monday   
 the vicar comes to talk to the        
 children in assembly.After this he    
 goes round the classes and tells them 
 a bible story.                        
                                       
 On Sunday the Sunday school have      
 a little time in church then go up to 
 school to talk about God and to       
 learn about Christianity. The school  
 is a church aided school.Once a month 
 the school orchestra plays at Family  
 Service.                              
                                       
  The Church use the school for many   
 meetings such as young wives,mothers  
 union and choir practice. The church  
 has dry rot and it will cost Â£12,000  
 to repair the damage.
