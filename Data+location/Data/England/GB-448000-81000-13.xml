		<title>13ECOLOGY: THE RIVER MEDINA</title>
		<content> Almost dividing our area in half, the 
{RIVER MEDINA}flows northwards towards 
 Newport. At first glance we were      
 disappointed; instead of the exciting 
 river we hoped to play in, we found   
 that at this early stage the RIVER    
 MEDINA was only 0.75m-1m wide. We had 
 fun jumping across it, trying not to  
 fall in the muddy parts alongside the 
 river. Farmers do not seem to be so   
 adventurous about jumping, and have   
 built small wooden bridges at         
 intervals! One bridge we discovered is
 2-3m wide and 4-5m long. Several      
 drains from the farmland join the     
 river. Cridmore farm has enlarged a   
 pond to attract wild fowl in their    
 marshy area. The Wilderness is mostly 
 marsh and rough pasture; it covers    
 about 24 hectares. Cridmore means     
 rough moor.
