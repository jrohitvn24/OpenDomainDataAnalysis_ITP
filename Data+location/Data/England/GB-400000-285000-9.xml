		<content>  A Domesday questionnaire was returned
 by 30 families.                       
  Some of the major{concerns}were{lack}
 of{sports facilities and parks}in the 
 area and the{poor}standard of{roads.} 
 Others mentioned the fact that there  
 should be{hygiene restrictions on dogs
 in public places. Several people      
 complained about{vandalism}and they   
 also stated it was{unsafe}to go out at
 night. The{Harborne Walkway}is an     
 example of this where at night there  
 have been{muggings and gluesniffers } 
 and even a murder!                    
  Some of the more interesting         
 suggestions include the building of an
 underground rail system and the       
 renovation of older buildings. The    
 house belonging to one of the children
 in our class on the Calthorpe Estate  
 won an award in 1980 because it had   
 been beautifully renovated.           </content>
