		<title>20BENENDEN WEALD, ENDING.</title>
		<content> The group which did this project is   
 made up of girls from the sixth-form  
 of Benenden School, studying geography
 for Advanced Level. The field work was
 done in July l985 by:-                
      Lucinda Aitken,                  
      Mary-Louise Gurdon, photographer,
      Mary Harper,                     
      Alexandra Higgins,               
      Philippa Myers,                  
      Sally Nevard,                    
      Harreit Purser.                  
 We were assisted by many including    
 Kate Strong, and the warden of        
 Swattenden Centre. The family at      
 Forest Farm was most co-opertive, for 
 which we are very grateful, as we also
 are to Damien Sanderson for sorting   
 out our difficulties with the         
 computer.
