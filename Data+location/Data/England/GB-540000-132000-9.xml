		<content>   The church itself dates back to     
 1836, which is comparatively new for a
 church (most churches date back to the
 fifteenth century).Three hundred      
 people can be seated in the church    
 very comfortably; four hundred and    
 fifty at a maximum amount;The         
 only time it is this full is at       
 weddings or funerals.                 
   In nineteen eighty-four the income  
 for the year was approximately        
 twenty thousand pounds, which is      
 perfectly adequate for the upkeep of  
 the church.                           
   The Reverend himself does not run   
 any village communities, such as      
 mother's group; he thinks that there  
 are enough things going on in the     
 village.The only other religions in   
 the area are; Baptist, Scientologists 
 and Anthroposophy.
