		<title>02BIRDS IN BENWELL</title>
		<content> Around {Benwell}the most {common}     
{birds}are pigeons and sparrows. As    
 well as wild pigeons some people keep 
 them to race. Sparrows are all wild   
 and can always be seen around houses  
 and gardens. Other common birds are   
 the blackbird and starling.The tree   
 sparrow is the smallest one of our    
 sparrows and it nests in holes in     
 trees. The chaffinch is a regular     
 character around Benwell.It nests in  
 the trees.To the west of our school is
 some open space and an old park with  
 large trees.Sometimes the {kestrel}   
 hovers over the open space looking for
 small mammals. Recently magpies have  
 been seen darting among the trees in  
 the park.To the east of the school a  
 pond in the new nature park attracts a
 number of gulls. When the school yard 
 is quiet and empty, pied wagtails     
 often land there and look for insects.</content>
