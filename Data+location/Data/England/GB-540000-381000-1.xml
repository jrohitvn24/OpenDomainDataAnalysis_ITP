		<content> A popular feature in the area over    
 recent years, Withern has its own     
 trout farm situated around the        
 building which used to be a water mill
 for the area. The village comprises of
 a Methodist Chapel circa mid 19th     
 century, a ruined Anglican church and 
 cemetery, a pair of alms houses, a    
 primary school and a riding stable    
 situated in the old manor house. In   
 regard to local history, an           
 underground passage joins this manor  
 house to the Anglican church and      
 possibly dates back to the time of    
 the English Civil War. The rectory is 
 still used by the priest for this area
 and has a paddock attached which shows
 features of strip farming. Situated   
 across the road from the manor is an  
 ancient monument called Castle Hill   
 and moat. Tothill manor is a good     
 example of a 17th. century manorhouse.</content>
