There are a lot of farms in our area.  
Most of the farmers keep dairy cows but
some have beef cattle, sheep and pigs. 
Some of the land is fairly flat and is 
good but there is also a lot of steeply
sloping poor land. All the farmers we  
interviewed make either silage or hay  
for winter fodder. Silage is now more  
popular than hay, mainly because it is 
easier to get. Some farmers also buy   
straw, which comes from outside our    
area.                                  
                                       
Farms here are quite small compared    
with the rest of the country. Some of  
the farmers work full time on the land,
often employing extra workers at       
harvest time. Those farms which are    
very small combine farming with another
occupation.
