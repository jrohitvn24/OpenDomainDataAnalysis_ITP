 NAME "PARK MILL COLLIERY".(257118)    
{AN ACCOUNT OF MINING AT PARK MILL     
{COLLIERY BY BRIAN WHARAM}.            
 I AM A COALMINER WORKING AT PARK MILL 
 COLLIERY, CLAYTON WEST.  THIS IS AN   
 OLD COAL MINE FIRST OPENED OVER A{100 
{YEARS}AGO. IN THOSE DAYS MINERS       
 USED CANDLES FOR LIGHT AND HAD TO DIG 
 THE COAL OUT USING {PICKS}AND {       
{SHOVELS.}IT WAS VERY HARD WORK. EVEN  
 10 YEAR OLD BOYS AND GIRLS WORKED     
 DOWN THE MINE. THEY HAD TO GO HOME    
 DIRTY AS THERE WERE NO BATHS AT THE   
 PIT. SOME MINERS NEVER USED TO WASH   
 THEIR BACKS AS THEY THOUGHT THIS      
 WOULD MAKE THEM WEAK AND WOULD BE     
 UNABLE TO DIG COAL.                   
{CONDITIONS}ARE MUCH BETTER TODAY. WE  
 HAVE ELECTRIC LIGHTS IN THE MAIN      
 TUNNELS AND A 'CAP LAMP' WHICH FIXES  
 ON TO OUR SAFETY HELMETS.             </content>
