 in the locality. The W I Produce Show

 the high standard in both flower and  
 vegetable growing. Two vineyards at

 wine in l984 from the Seyve Villard,  
 Madeleine Angevin and Seibel varieties
 of grape. Other outdoor activities    
 include shooting, riding, bee keeping,
 rambling and breeding Siberian        
 Huskies. Several leagues of skittles  
 and darts are played throughout the   
 year at the Jolliffe Arms. Bell

 popular especially with the teenagers.

 youngsters also combine pleasure and  
 profit with sponsored walking, cyling 
 and swimming for charity.
