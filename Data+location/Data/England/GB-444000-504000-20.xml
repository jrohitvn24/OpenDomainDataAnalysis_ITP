		<content> Bowls - Mr Kitching and his son are   
 both members of the club. There       
 are roughly 40 members in the club.   
 Mr.Cardow is the secretary, they play 
 most nights in the summer but during  
 the winter they go to the indoor green
 in Thornaby Sports Pavilion.          
                                       
 All Saints Church is very nice,       
 Because you can hear squeaking of     
 mice,                                 
 If you look up to the ceiling         
 You might just see some of the plaster
 peeling,                              
 But if you look up higher than that,  
 You might just see the remains of a   
 bat!                                  
 But if you look just outside the      
 church,                               
 You might just see a little bird      
 perched.
