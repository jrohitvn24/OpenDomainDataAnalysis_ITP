		<title>13     Northam Area</title>
		<content>                                       
   The residents of Northam are very   
 friendly and there is a nice          
 atmosphere.                           
   The residents feel that it is not a 
 very good place for the elderly and   
 young children to live. The river is  
 polluted by the factories and the     
 roads are busy and dangerous to old   
 folk and children. There are too many 
 flats and not enough houses and even  
 though there are three small parks    
 they feel there is not enough space   
 for children to play.                 
   Northam has its own precinct and    
 people feel that they have good access
 to the town centre where they can do  
 their shopping.
