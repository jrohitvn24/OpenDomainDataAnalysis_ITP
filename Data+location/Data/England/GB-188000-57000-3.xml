		<title>03Pocahontas and Queens Pit.</title>
		<content> The name Indian Queens is an unusual  
 one for a place.The explanation given 
 by the locals is that the name comes  
 from an overnight stop made by the Red
 Indian princess Pocahontas on her way 
 to London from Falmouth early in the  
 17th.century.There was an inn called  
 The Indian Queen,but it is gone       
 now.Stagecoaches used to stop there.  
                                       
 Indian Queens Pit was once a tin mine 
 in use between 1850 and 1860.It was   
 derelict from 1860 until 1921 when it 
 was sold for Â£60 to the Methodists of 
 Queens and Fraddon to be used for     
 treats and religious services.It fell 
 into disrepair again during the Second
 World War and by 1970 was in an awful 
 state.In 1976 it was restored and a   
 Silver Jubilee service was held in    
 1977.Now it is used by various local  
 organizations.                        </content>
