		<title>17THE TOWN HALL</title>
		<content> The Town Hall or Princes Theatre is   
 in Station Road. It was built in 1893 
 and can hold up to 11,200 people at   
 anyone time sitting down. It cost     
 12,000 pounds to build. It is not just
 used for shows because there are often
 sales there, and every Tuesday there  
 is a Badminton Club which you can     
 join.                                 
 In the entrance hall there is an      
 Information Bureau with information   
 about Clacton to give away. You can   
 also get tickets for the next show    
 there.                                
 If you go inside the front door, and  
 up some stairs you can get to the     
 balcony. Out of the 11,200 seats there
 are about 400 seats up there.         
 The show going on at the moment is a  
 dancing show called Stop Press Extra  
 by the Tiffany Stage Academy.
