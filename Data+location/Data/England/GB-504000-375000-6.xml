		<title>06DECREASING WILDLIFE</title>
		<content> Most of the wildlife in{1985 }might   
 be extinct hundreds of years from     
 now.At the moment the most common     
 animals are mice which include the    
 Dormouse,field Mouse and house        
 Mouse.There are other rodents like    
 voles, shrews, rats,water voles.I     
 think that the bird which will become 
 extinct will be the wood pigeon       
 because people such as farmers, game  
 keepers and sports men shoot them and 
 do not replace or breed them like     
 other birds such as Pheasants.        
 Despite the farmers' attempts to      
 exclude the magpies and jays from     
 our area,they have started to return.I
 think that squirrels and foxes will   
 also become extinct.The removal of    
 hedgerows and the increased use of    
 pesticides has made a visible         
 difference to the 'wildlife'          
 population, both animal and floral.   </content>
