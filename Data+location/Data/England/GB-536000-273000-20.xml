		<content> When children reach the age of 11     
 years, they leave our primary school  
 in{Earith}for a large{comprehensive}in
{Ramsey,}10 miles away. A lot of things
 change in their lives. They can no    
 longer{walk}to school, but they have  
 to get up early in order to catch the 
{school bus.}It leaves the village at  
 8:00am. and returns at 4:45pm. It is a
 much{longer day.}The{top junior class 
 went along for a{visit}to find out    
 just how different things would be.   
 Everybody was anxious. The first thing
 we all noticed was the{immense size}of
 the building. It was{huge.}We were all
 bound to get lost! We all noticed     
 their{uniforms; purple blazers, grey  
{trousers or skirts}and a{tie.}There   
 would be so many names to learn. We   
 would no longer have just one class   
{teacher}but{several!}More{homework!}We
 will certainly have so much to learn. </content>
