    Stutton primary school was first   
built in 1835.The Reverend Thomas mills
held a bazaar to raise the money.The   
village then had a population of four  
hundred people but nearly 200 pounds   
was raised !                           
    In 1849 a new school was built on  
land adjacent to the original          
building.This was larger and had more  
plaground space.The building had room  
for 120 pupils.                        
    In 1964 during a long hot,dry      
summer the school was burnt down.The   
children were then educated at         
neighbouring schools until 1965 when a 
new building was opend on the same     
site.                                  
    There are now 60 children aged from
5-11 years at the school.The school is 
an important part of the village due to
close links between home and school.   </content>
