		<content> The apple trees are between 4-5 metres
 in height, although 2 orchards have   
 much smaller trees(2.5m) but at a rate
 of 1000 per ha.  There seems to be a  
 trend towards smaller trees - perhaps 
 because of easier harvesting.         
 The farmer surveyed said that modern  
 fruit farming is very expensive.      
 Planting an orchard could cost over   
 Â£5000 per ha. and is a highly skilled 
 business. The farmer has to choose the
 ideal site, the right varieties of    
 fruit, the correct time for planting  
 and the pollinators.  Following this  
 come skilled operations such as       
 planting, spraying and fertilising.   
 One recent change is the cutting down 
 of orchards due to overseas           
 competition.  French Golden Delicious 
 can be produced more cheaply, so many 
 local farmers cannot afford to        
 maintain their orchards.              </content>
