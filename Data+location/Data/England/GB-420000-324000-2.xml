		<title>02ANSLOW VILLAGE</title>
		<content>The first thing that strikes you when  
you enter Anslow village is the        
quietness of the place.There           
are no busy roads or motorways to      
disturb the peace.One other thing that 
is noticeable immediately is  the      
strange assortment of house types.The  
majority of houses are quite new,very  
fancy houses such as one               
called,Â£Annesly Grange'.Some are old   
semi-detached houses such as,Â£Walton   
Villa's',(built in 1899).The majority  
of land around the village is owned by 
6 farmers ,5 of the farms are mixed    
farms but 1 is a fruit farm during the 
summer months .There are very few      
facilities in the area but there is a  
Methodist chapel a church a very       
popular pub and a well used village    
hall which was built in 1952 .
