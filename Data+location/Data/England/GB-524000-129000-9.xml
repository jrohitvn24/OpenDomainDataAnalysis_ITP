 recreation ground.One of the popular  
 events is the Jumble sale. We have 2

 Brownies and for charity.At our school
 we have sports day where either       
 friends or relatives come and watch   
 children of our school run in races   
 against each other.The sack race is   
 fun.One person gets into a sack and   
 races against the other person.We have
