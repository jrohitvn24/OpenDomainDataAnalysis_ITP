		<content> When Mr White came across to school he
 told us all about the school .He said 
 the desks were like chess boards and  
 we had a bell on top of our school.The
 rope came down into class two and the 
 bell ringer came at 8.45, then he     
 would ring the bell at 9.00.Some      
 people had to come from Tollerton to  
 school.Part of our class room could be
 made into a stage,but it is all       
 painted over and stuck now.They didn't
 wear a uniform in those days.In the   
 infants class they wrote in sand and  
 when they moved up into into a        
 different class they                  
 used slate and a piece of chalk to    
 write with.If anyone was naughty,a boy
 would get the cane and a girl would   
 get a slap on the wrist.
