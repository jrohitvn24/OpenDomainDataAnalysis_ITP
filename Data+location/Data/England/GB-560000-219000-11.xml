		<title>11Crops - Oil Seed Rape</title>
		<content>   People often see a field of Oil Seed
 Rape and think it is mustard. This is 
 easily done as they both have the same
 bright yellow flower.                 
   A few years ago the EEC decided that
 something had to be done about the    
 shortage of vegetable oils, so they   
 encouraged farmers to grow Rape and in
 a short time we have managed to grow  
 overwhelming amounts.                 
   The growth of Rape has its problems:
 birds dig up and eat the freshly      
 planted seeds, and sometimes not even 
 gas bangers can drive them away. Also 
 diseases can cause damage if not      
 treated with chemical sprays.         
   Rape is quite expensive, but gives  
 high yields per acre. Large stockpiles
 have been made, and again this year we
 may have bumper yields in the Dunmow  
 area and all over Europe.
