		<title>07HIGH PEAK TRAIL (MONYASH)</title>
		<content>{  The High Peak trail}was built in{   
{1830}to join up the canals at{Cromford
 and at{Whaley Bridge}to carry cotton  
 from the cotton mill at{Cromford.     
   It is now owned by the{Peak         
{District National Park.}The lines were
 taken up in 1968 ,and now the track is
 used by the public for riding,cycling 
 and walking.It is very popular with   
 visitors.                             
   At{Parsley Hay}(which used to be an 
 old railway station) there is a{Cycle-
{hire shop}where people can hire bikes 
 to ride on the trail.                 
   The High Peak Trail is also         
 important for{conservation.}Many wild 
 flowers like{ox-eye daisy, scabious,  
{clover}and{birds-foot trefoil}grow    
 along the trail.So the trail is       
 replacing the species-rich meadows    
 which are fast disappearing from the  
 normal landscape.                     </content>
