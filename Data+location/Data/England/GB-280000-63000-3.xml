		<content>{Farm - General.} This small dairy farm
 in Broadhempston with 24 Guernsey cows
 is run by Mr. Helley alone except at  
 hay making when he has help.  He rents
 the 48 acres and the bungalow from    
 Devon County Council.  He has 30 acres
 used for grazing, 5 acres for barley  
 and 2 acres for fodder beet, but 1    
 field and a cider apple orchard are   
 not in our survey area.  The cows on  
 average are ten years old and produce 
 about 270 litres daily.  They are     
 milked twice a day at 7am and 5pm.    
 Mr. Helley has a tractor and          
 accessories.  He has a modern parlour 
 which can milk 3 cows at a time and a 
 bulk refrigerated tank. {Future.} The 
 EEC quotas have bothered him and at   
 the moment his hopes are not very     
 good.
