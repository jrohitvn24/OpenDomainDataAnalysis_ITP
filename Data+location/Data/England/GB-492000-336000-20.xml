		<title>20WATER MANAGEMENT</title>
		<content> The River Witham runs locally through 
 Wyndham Park and Riverside Park, past 
 Manthorpe and Belton Villages.  Its   
 upkeep is the work of the Anglian     
 Water Authority. Just recently a      
 controversial subject has been the use
 of lead shot in local angling.  Ducks,
 Geese and Swans graze in water 2 to 3 
 feet deep and if the lead shot is     
 tangled in the weeds the birds swallow
 it and it has dire consequences.      
                                       
 The Department of the Environment     
 recently indicated to the Goverment   
 that it would consider making an order
 under the control of Polution Act     
 1974, banning the import and sale of  
 such lead shot.                       
                                       
 At its monthly meeting in autumn 1985 
 the A.W.A. agreed that this would make
 sense.                                </content>
