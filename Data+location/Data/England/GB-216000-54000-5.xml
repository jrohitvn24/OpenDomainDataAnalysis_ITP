		<title>05SCHOOL AND VILLAGE YEAR 1</title>
		<content> Our school is quite small.It has two  
 classrooms,one big,one small,with a   
 screen between the two.The toilets are
 outside.The kitchen is built into the 
 wall of the school.At Halloween the   
 children dress up as ghosts or        
 witches.There is a big celebration for
 Guy Fawkes night.The children make all
 the gifts to be sold at the Christmas 
 Bazaar.The Easter {Vintage Rally}is   
 the biggest event in the village year.
 The third and fourth year children    
 take part in an {Adventure Week}each  
 year.The Juniors are involved in an { 
 annual{Music Day}with 10 other        
 schools.This year,though,the schools  
 performed a musical about Amazon      
 Indians.We have two {Sports Days,}one 
 our own and one with 5 other schools. 
 These six schools are in a "cluster   
 group" and often work together.
