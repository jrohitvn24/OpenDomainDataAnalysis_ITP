 members of the Harbertonford and      
 Harberton Womens Institute.           
 The Institute meets monthly, the      
 venues alternating between the two    
 villages although some members come   
 from the neighbouring villages of     
 Halwell and Morleigh.                 
 Many members have been involved in the
 collection and compiling of the data, 
 but the writing was done by this years
 President - Maggie MacKenzie,
