		<title>10Willoughby Line Reserve</title>
		<content>  This particular section of branch    
 line, once owned by the L.N.E.R.      
 and running to Mablethorpe and beyond 
 is now owned by the Lincs and         
 S.Humberside Trust.                   
  Some of the line has been ploughed up
 near Willoughby but the rest has been 
 maintained to the Trust Standard      
 applied to all reserves.              
  Much of the land is rough grass on   
 the old rail bed. This is the haunt of
 Small Blue and Common Blue butterflies
 in summer. The line is bordered for   
 much of its length by Hawthorn with   
 occasional clumps of Birch. To the    
 south of the line and only accessible 
 from it is a private fishing pond,    
 thickly bordered by trees, especially 
 Willow and Ash. This area provides    
 good cover for birds, particularly    
 Blackcap warblers and Reed Warblers.  
 Cuckoos are common residents in season</content>
