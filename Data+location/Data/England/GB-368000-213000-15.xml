		<content> Westbury Court Home for the Elderly is
 on the A48 between the village church 
 and the National Trust property of    
 Westbury Court Gardens. The Home,     
 administered by the Gloucs County     
 Council replaced the old Westbury     
 Workhouse. The residents have         
 individually furnished rooms, double  
 or single, on two floors of the       
 building. The warden in charge is     
 assisted by a very caring staff. The  
 wide front entrance leads to offices, 
 domestic, dining and large social     
 rooms. There are also smaller rooms   
 where guests can be welcomed privately
 This year of 1985 has seen the whole  
 building re-roofed. This clean, bright
 Home is set in the surrounds of lawns,
 flower borders and garden furniture   
 and the elderly can walk around the   
 Dutch gardens. The Home also possesses
 a Minibus for outings.                </content>
