		<title>13An interview with the Vicar</title>
		<content>  When asked if the number of people   
 coming to church had increased or     
 decreased through the years he        
 replied,"Decreased while I've been    
 working.It is mostly{retired}people   
 that come to church because they have 
 more time." He said that it was mostly
{women}that came to church.He said that
 if he hadn't become a vicar he would  
 like to have been a teacher,teaching  
{modern language}.His favourite hymn   
 is{'Alleluia,sing to Jesus'}.We asked 
 about sport and he said that he       
 used to play{cricket}and{hockey}but he
 doesn't play any now because most     
 sports are played on a weekend when he
 is working.He goes on holiday for a   
 few weeks in the summer and for a     
 couple of days after{Christmas}and{   
{Easter}.
