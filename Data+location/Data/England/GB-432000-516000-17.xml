		<title>17AN ORDNANCE SURVEYOR</title>
		<content> My dads name is Peter Dickens.He is   
 36 years old. He works in Darlington  
 at Vincent House. He works for the    
 government Ordnance Survey department.
 He gets up at 7.00 and goes to work at
 7.45 usually he comes in at 4.30 pm.He
 has one hour for his packed lunch     
 which he will eat in the office.There 
 are 12 people working in the office 11
 men and a woman. Some days  he goes   
 out with some other surveyors because 
 he is a senior surveyor. He goes out  
 into the fields with a theodolite.A   
 theodolite is a tripod  with a sort of
 telescope on top which the surveyor   
 looks through to measure how high     
 above sea level the ground is and he  
 keeps a record of these heights and   
 puts them on his maps.At the moment he
 is working on the new Darlington      
 eastern by-pass.
