		<title>02     St Mary's Church</title>
		<content>    The church was built 500 yrs ago   
 at the end of Henry V11's reign. It   
 was built with lava stone and was     
 finished in 1500.                     
                                       
    There are 85 steps up to the tower 
 and there are 8 bells in the belfry.  
 6 of these are old and 2 are fairly   
 new. At the top of the tower is a     
 weather vane that was put up in 1862. 
 The clock had its face replaced about 
 6 yrs ago.                            
                                       
    Outside there is an old cross      
 damaged  by Cromwell's men in the     
 Civil War. It was probably put in the 
 churchyard for safety.                
                                       
    The rector of the church is Rev.A. 
 Watson who has been rector for        
 nearly 14 yrs.                        
                                       </content>
