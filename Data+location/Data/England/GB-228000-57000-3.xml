		<content>  Mrs.Babbage,our school cook,remembers
 Widegates when it had 2 grocers,a     
 petrol pump and shed butcher,hairdress
 draper and Post Office.Mrs.Lake's     
 house,Lane End used to be two houses  
 one up and one down.There was no      
 toilet inside."I can see Granfer      
 Bonney carrying his pail to the garden
 shed toilets where there was no flush 
 just buckets which had to be empitied 
 in a pit in the garden." Mrs.B's      
 mother had a shed with a well inside. 
 The pump was taken out and the well   
 boarded over.During the war a District
 Nurse lived in this shed.It was a     
 bed,kitchen and living room all in one
 with only an oil lamp and heater.Girl 
 evacuees went to Trenode school,the   
 boys used the Sunday school room.     
 There were strawberry gardens         
 at Colvase,remains of the greenhouses 
 can still be seen.                    </content>
