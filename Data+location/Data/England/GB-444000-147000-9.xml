		<content>   There are many annual events that   
 take place in Whitchurch.Every year   
 there is a Carnival.There is always a 
 Carnival Queen and Princess picked for
 this event.There is usually an opening
 ceremony often held on Lord Denning's 
 lawn when the weather is fine,if not  
 then the event usually takes place at 
 the Whitchurch Centre.                
   There is also a Folk Festival held  
 in the town every year.This is mainly 
 singing but sometimes there have been 
 groups of dancers.                    
   During many weeks of the            
 year,especially in the summer you will
 see adverts about jumble sales,bazaars
 and sales from the many Societies and 
 clubs that there are in Whitchurch.
