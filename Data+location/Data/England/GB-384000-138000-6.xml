		<title>06Trout Farm 1:The Deverills</title>
		<content> The{Trout Farm}at{Longbridge Deverill 
 has been open for six years. They were
 attracted to the site because they can
 obtain fresh cool water from the bore 
 hole at the{Cress Farm}at{Hill        
{Deverill}and water from the{River     
{Wylye.}They are also relatively close 
 to the London market.                 
 The Trout Farm consists of two large  
 sheds housing the tanks of trout in   
 their various stages, and a shop where
 the trout are also prepared for sale. 
 They also smoke the trout and have    
 their own cress beds. About twenty    
 customers a day call at the shop for  
 fresh trout and cress but the biggest 
 customers are restaurants. A van takes
 retail orders mainly smoked trout to  
 London three times a week and the farm
 also supplies local restaurants. The  
 first large order of smoked trout has 
 just been despatched to America.      </content>
