		<title>19MY DAY IN KINGSCLERE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  On Wednesdays I get up at 7.00 a.m. I
 dress and go downstairs. I make my    
 lunch for school. At 7.30 I'm ready to
 eat my breakfast. I get the Frosties  
 down from the shelf and pour them into
 a dish.                               
  After breakfast I read a book. At    
 8.05 my mum and I get into the car;   
 she drops me off at the top of Ash    
 Grove and drives on to Tadley.        
  I walk down to the gates of          
 Kingsclere Primary School. Not many   
 people are there this early. At last  
 some of my friends come.              
  At 8.55 the whistle goes. We all go  
 on to the playground and one of the   
 teachers tells us to go in. When we   
 get in, our teacher calls the register
 and we settle down to our maths. The  
 book we use is called Scottish Primary
 Maths.                                
                                       </content>
