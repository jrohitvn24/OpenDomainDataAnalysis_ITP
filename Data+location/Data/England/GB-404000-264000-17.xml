		<content>  One o'clock and we are putting the   
 sports equipment outside and chairs   
 for our parents.Thursday 5th July,    
 a hot sunny day and we are ready for  
 our sports day.All the children are   
 in animal teams,races start at 1.45   
 with a {hoop race},we all line up     
 and when the whistle blows run and    
 bowl a hoop to the finish,our parents 
 cheer.If you win you are given a gold 
 or silver badge.The {sack race}is good
 fun,everyone must hop and jump along  
 inside a sack,my friend Jane won the  
{bucket and bean bag}but she is not    
 as fast as Claire who won the{sprint. 
 At the end there is a{toddlers race   
  and we all cheer. Our headmistress   
 gives them all a sweet.After the race 
 we have icecream.Sportsday is really  
 good fun.
