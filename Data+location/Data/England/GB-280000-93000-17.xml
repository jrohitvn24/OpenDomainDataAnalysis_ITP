		<title>17THE DONKEY SANCTUARY</title>
		<content> The first Sanctuary for distressed and
 mistreated donkeys opened at Ottery St
 Mary in 1969. In 1974 new premises at 
 Sidmouth were purchased. The charity  
 has since purchaed four further farms,
 including the one at Tedburn St Mary, 
 and now cares for almost 2000 donkeys.
 400 of these are at Tedburn.          
 The sanctuary gives every donkey      
 admitted the right of life, regardless
 of age or health, and the best        
 possible treatment, care and drugs to 
 preserve its life to the maximum. It  
 provides peace, freedom and           
 protection. Death is only induced in  
 the event of extreme suffering.       
 Some donkeys are rehabilitated to     
 homes that can offer the best         
 conditions. No donkey is ever sold.   
 Once they have been admitted they have
 security for life.                    
 A most unusual charity.               </content>
