		<content>   The countryside around our area is  
 quite beautiful.There are the         
 downlands to the north where the      
 chalklands give rise to good          
 farmland,and much closer to the town  
 we have the River Test which runs     
 through a very picturesque valley.    
   There is always plenty of wildlife  
 to see on the many waljs that you     
 could make in this area.The Test is of
 course noted for it's trout,but along 
 the course of the river you can see   
 kingfishers and swans which reguarly  
 can be seen flying along the          
 valley.Many of Britain's small mammals
 can be seen in the area.              
   The flora of the area is typically  
 chalkland.If take a walk through      
 the area you will find very few areas 
 which are eyesores spoilt by          
 pollution.
