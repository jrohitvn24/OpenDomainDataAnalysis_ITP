		<title>02Robert Snooks - Highwayman</title>
		<content>{Robert Snooks was the last highwayman 
{to be hanged.}There is still a stone  
 to mark his grave.He was tried on the 
 8th March 1802 and he was hanged four 
 days later.He was hanged for a mail   
 robbery.He robbed a postboy,John      
 Stevens,and stole six leather mail    
 bags from him.Snooks shot holes into  
 the bags which held Bank of England   
 fifty and ten pound notes.The postboy,
 scared out of his wits,ran to inform  
 the postmaster of Berkhamsted. Snooks,
 who had now fled, was heading for     
 Southwark and then for Hungerford     
 where he was born.When he was caught  
 he was put in Newgate Prison. After   
 some time he was transferred to       
 Hertford Jail. He was charged upon the
 oaths of John Stevens.He was hanged on
 12th March 1802. It is said that if   
 you run round the four trees where he 
 was hanged you will see his ghost.    </content>
