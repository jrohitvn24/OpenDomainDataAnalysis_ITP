		<title>18SMEATHARPE-FOR RETIREMENT?</title>
		<content> Many people retire to rural areas     
 similar to Smeatharpe.  Certainly here
 there is less crime than urban areas. 
 However, perhaps the effect on men of 
 retiring from a life-time of paid em- 
 ployment is under-estimated, but sadly
 many die within 3 years.  This can    
 leave a widow isolated, often hundreds
 of miles from family and friends.     
 Urban life in fact has many advantages
 for the senior citizen - cheap public 
 transport, reduction in theatre and   
 cinema tickets, lunch clubs, meals on 
 wheels, cheap rates at hair-dressers, 
 chiropody, dental and health services 
 within easy access.   These can be in-
 valuable at the time of life when     
 people have more leisure time, less   
 money and possibly more health        
 problems.
