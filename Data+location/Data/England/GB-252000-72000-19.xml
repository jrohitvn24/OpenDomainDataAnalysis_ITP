		<content> At Hillsiode along the A384 at        
 Merrivale there is a popular riding   
 school where riders may enjoy the     
 freedom and views of the surrounding  
 moor. The discontinued railway track  
 from Plymouth to Princetown runs      
 through the area. Walking along this  
 track is a pastime which many local   
 people indulge in. Some of the views  
 from here are quite breathtaking. The 
 young and agile enjoy climbing the    
 Tors, such as Vixen Tor and Pew Tor.  
 Here too is a favourite picnic spot,  
 and in the rocky basin which is full  
 of rainwater, the children love       
 fishing - especially for frog and toad
 spawn. Hidden in the rocks below Pew  
 Tor is a"Dartmoor Letterbox".
