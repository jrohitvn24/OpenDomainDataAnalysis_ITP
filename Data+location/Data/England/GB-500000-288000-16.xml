		<content>Our block has all the range of housing 
typical in Britain, but the majority of
them are middle class owner occupiers. 
In the part of Oundle in our block,    
most of the houses have been built     
since 1945. There are some council     
houses but most are privately owned.   
The village (Glapthorn) contains about 
60 houses of which 14 are council      
houses. Some of them have been built   
post 1945, and about 15 of them are    
farm workers cottages that have been   
conerted, and enlarged, for families   
moving into the village from outside.  
This process continues. It is a very   
pleasant area to live.
