 Steetly Gravel Company is the main    
 industry of the area,and is gradually 
 expanding into the south-east of the  
 region.Gravel is being dug out from   
 the flood-plain of the riverTrent.Land
 is bought under a compulsory purchase 
 order,and after the gravel has been   
 removed the land must be restored to  
 its former state.Some of this restored
 land is now reverting to grazing      
 land                                  
 The "DRAG-LINE"(the line of digging)is
 coming very near to the village of    
 Barrow.                               
 Lorries take the gravel many miles    
 away from the area.
