		<content>     As this area is predominantly fell
 country, walking and rambling are     
 increasingly popular pursuits         
 involving both local people and       
 visitors.  The high, wild rocky       
 country of the fells, with their      
 short, rough grass covering and open  
 aspect makes them ideal for high and  
 low-level walking as well as for      
 fell-running.                         
      Cavers, hydrologists and         
 geologists are attracted by the varied
 rocks, tumbling streams, small        
 potholes and caves.  There is an      
 outdoor specialist shop in Sedbergh as
 well as several field study centres in
 the area which have recently been set 
 up.  Nine miles away in Dent there is 
 Whernside Manor, the national caving  
 centre.
