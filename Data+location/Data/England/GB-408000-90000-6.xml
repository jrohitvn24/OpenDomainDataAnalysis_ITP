		<content> Tourists come to Bournemouth for the  
 climate and the beach because it is   
 clean and sandy. Many of the visitors 
 have been before, and they come mainly
 from the Midlands.                    
                                       
 The tourists stay mainly in hotels    
 near the sea front and the most       
 popular ones are on the west cliff, or
 in holiday flats.                     
                                       
 Bournemouth has a large shopping      
 centre and visitors are able to buy   
 souvenirs and clothes. The Bournemouth
 International Centre opened earlier in
 the year and the tourists I spoke to  
 liked it.There are also night clubs,  
 cinemas, ice skating rinks and other  
 leisure centres for visitors to enjoy.
