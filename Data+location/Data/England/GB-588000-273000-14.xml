		<title>14A Famous Poet</title>
		<content>                                       
Robert Bloomfield, author of 'The      
Farmer's Boy' lived locally in his     
early life. The cottage stands in the  
centre of the village close to the     
church, and is presently being         
skilfully plastered with pargetting, to
make a notable feature in the village  
of a cottage previously uninteresting  
architecturally, being a simple all-   
brick building.                        
Robert Bloomfield lived from 1766 to   
1823, in his later years away from the 
village, including the period during   
which he wrote the famous poem.        
The area, with its rich farming        
heritage (by far the great majority of 
people in the village were farm        
labourers at the time), would have     
been formative inspiration for the     
boy as he grew up in that environment.
