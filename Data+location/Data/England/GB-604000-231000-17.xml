		<content> Groups like the Olive Branch,which is 
 a group of younger ladies, and the    
 Good Neighbours, a group of senior    
 citizens, hold regular meetings.      
 Because of the fact that Dedham is in 
 a conservation area there are also the
 Dedham Vale Society and the Footpath  
 Society who help to make sure that the
 area remains as beautiful as it is.   
 There are two adult football teams and
 a junior one, a cricket club, a canoe 
 club, an archery club and a tennis    
 club which has just started. Many     
 people in the area ride horses and    
 there is a riding stable.             
 There is also a branch of St John     
 Ambulance.                            
 Each year our school entertains the   
 Good Neighbours with gymnastics,      
 country dancing or singing.
