		<content> Witheridge lies in the centre of a    
 farming area.The farms vary in size   
 from thirty acres to one hundred and  
 fifty acres.On average they are about 
 one hundred acres.Dairy farming has   
 been the main type but due to new     
 quotas some farmers have changed to   
 beef cattle.Most of the farmers also  
 keep sheep and in this area they are  
 as prevalent as dairy herds.The main  
 dairy breeds are Friesians ,          
 Devonshires and Guernseys.The sheep   
 are usually Suffolk cross which are a 
 hardy type for this area.             
 There is very little arable farming.  
 Grass is grown for feeding livestock  
 and for cutting as silage and hay.    
 Most farms grow a little corn or wheat
 and in many cases one field is used   
 for Turnips.
