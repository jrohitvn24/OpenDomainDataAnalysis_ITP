		<title>06ANIMAL LIFE IN SHERIFFHALES</title>
		<content> When we went to our trip we saw two   
 animals.The first one was a mouse     
 which we found as we were resting near
 a bus stop.We were just having a rest 
 when one girl started to scream, our  
 teacher came over."What's the matter?"
 he said."There is a mouse on my       
 leg".Everybody crowded round to see   
 the mouse.After that in Sheriffhales  
 we saw a grey squirrel I didn't know  
 it was going to be that small.It was  
 coloured an orangy brown with flakes  
 of grey.It was jumping around in the  
 trees near the Sheriffhales church.It 
 was a very quiet area so that must be 
 why it lived there.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
