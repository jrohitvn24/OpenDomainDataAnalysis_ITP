		<content>There are sports grounds for cricket   
tennis and football in this part of    
Lavenham. Wallking, bird watching and  
shooting are available. The block forms
a corridor between two tourist villages
and good hotels and restaurants are at 
hand. Eating out with family and       
friends is a favoured leisure activity.
Theatre Clubs are based in Acton and   
Lavenham. Concerts of good standard    
take place in Lavenham. Membership of  
the Women's Institute, National Farmers
Union and Young Farmers Clubs offer    
social activities. A varied adult edu- 
cation programme in nearby Sudbury     
caters for a wide range of interests.  
Church and Charity activities offer    
relaxation. Car ownership widens the   
leisure possibilities for most         
households.
