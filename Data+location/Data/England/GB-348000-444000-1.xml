		<title>01THE HISTORY OF GARSTANG</title>
		<content>The original Domesday Book refers to   
the town as Cherestanc,and it belonged 
to the Lancasters.In those days        
Garstang was the 2nd largest parish in 
Wyre.The abbots of Cockersands were in 
 1311 given permission to hold two     
 airs a year and a weekly market.All of
these are still a major feature of the 
town today.The two fairs take the form 
of a Children's Parade and an          
Agricultural Show.Around the Cross are 
the only original cobblestones.The     
cross was restored in 1897 for Queen   
Victoria's jubilee.In the 19th century 
preachers could be heard reading aloud 
from the steps.Stoops Hall built in    
1882 was the head-quarters of the      
King's Own regiment.One of the oldest  
houses is the Arts Centre,which used to
be a boy's grammar school.
