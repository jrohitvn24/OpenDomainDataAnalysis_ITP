		<content>{A day in my life, by Lucy.} I got up, 
 dressed and went in the bathroom to   
 clean my teeth and went down to have  
 my breakfast. I had Sugar Puffs, after
 that we washed up and wiped up and    
 brushed our hair and went to school.  
 We did our shape book and when we     
 finished that we went out to play. We 
 played cricket because no-body wanted 
 to play Bristol Bulldogs. After that  
 we did Comprehension cards. Then we   
 got the tables ready for lunch. Then  
 into the library to work on the       
 computer. After that we had lunch and 
 went out to play. We did sewing in the
 afternoon, and we had service.        
  After school we went to Ashleys and  
 played with Sam the dog, then we went 
 back home and had tea. After tea we   
 played rounders in the playing field  
 and I got two people out. Then we came
 back, watched T.V. and went to bed.   </content>
