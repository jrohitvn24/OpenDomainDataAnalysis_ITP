		<title>07THE CHURCHYARD - HURSTBOURNE</title>
		<content> The{Lych Gate} looks old, but was made
 locally in 1951.Near it, under a large
 yew tree by the path, is a big        
 tombstone lying horizontally. It is in
 memory of{Mr James Blount}who died in 
 1864. In his will Mr Blount asked that
 a stone big enough for boys to play   
 marbles on, and flat like a table,    
 should be placed in the churchyard in 
 his memory. Unfortunately his         
 tombstone was covered in carvings and 
 is unsuitable for marble playing.     
 There is another stone under the lamp 
 by the church door, which is smaller  
 but flat and plain. It does not seem  
 to be a tombstone. Some parishoners   
 think this is the stone mentioned in  
 Mr Blount's will,others think that    
 this stone was suggested as a         
 substitute by those opposed to        
 children playing on a tombstone.
