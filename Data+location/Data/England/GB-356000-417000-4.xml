The Annual Carnival                    
                                       
Every year for a week early in July,   
the carnival begins to assemble in and 
around Astley Park.The carnival is     
spread over the Friday,Saturday and    
Sunday and begins with a Fair on the   
Friday.                                
Saturday is the main day with a lot of 
'floats' assembling on Botany Brow.From
there they make their way, in          
procession, to Astley Park where the   
'floats' are judged and prizes awarded 
for the first, second and third places.
At the Park there are numerous forms of
entertainment which the thousands of   
people engage in.                      
On Sunday morning a battle is usually  
enacted in the Park and on Sunday      
evening the Carnival concludes with a  
Fair.                                  </content>
