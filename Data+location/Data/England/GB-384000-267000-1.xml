		<content> The first impression that this a      
 tranquil corner of rural              
 Worcestershire is misleading.         
 Practically the whole square is       
 devoted to intensive horticulture and 
 agriculture controlled by large farms 
 using modern mechanised equipment.    
 Visitors are drawn to the area by the 
 opportunities to "Pick Your Own" soft 
 fruit.                                
                                       
 The population is small, being limited
 to the farms, a few larger houses and 
 part of a housing estate at Waresley  
                                       
 Despite the rural scene there is      
 evidence in plenty of commerce and    
 industry. A busy dual carriageway road
 carries heavy volumes of private and  
 commercial traffic, ther is a new     
 roadside restaurant, a caravan site   
 and a garden shop.{                   </content>
