		<title>19HAPPY VALLEY, CULVERSTONE</title>
		<content> In the south west corner of this area 
 there is a very attractive forked     
 valley running from the top of the    
 North Downs to the Medway valley at   
 Cuxton.  Much of it was originally    
 coppiced woodland and downland but has
 degenerated into scrub.  In the l930's
 the land was sold in small lots and   
 occupied under the planning           
 designation of "Weekend and Holiday   
 Chalet Area".  Much difficulty was    
 experienced by the local authority in 
 trying to enforce these rules and the 
 result has been indiscriminate        
 development.  In the l984/5 Local Plan
 the area comes under normal Green Belt
 Planning Rules, with no new dwellings 
 allowed in the hope that in this way  
 the area can be tidied up and made    
 more acceptable generally.            
                                       
                                       </content>
