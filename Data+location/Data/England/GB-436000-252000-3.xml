 There is going to be a motorway past  
 our village.The M40 will run from     
 Warwick to Oxford.It is going to help 
 people travel more easily,but it will 
 spoil a lot of the countryside.It will
 speed up the traffic but I think it   
 should not be built.It is going though
 a quiet country lane that I like to   
 walk along.To build it they would     
 have to knock down a lot of barns and 
 old buildings and it will ruin the    
 habitats of much of the wildlife.     
 It will go though a lot of farm land  
 but farmers know how useful it        
 would be.It will probably make the    
 village air polluted and more busy.   
 What was once a quite silent village  
 will turn into a noisy area.          
  Most people inside the village       
 disagree with the motorway but most   
 people outside will find it useful.   </content>
