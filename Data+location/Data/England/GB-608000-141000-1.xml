		<title>01BRABOURNE-A GENERAL VIEW.</title>
		<content>   Brabourne is situated approximately 
 seven miles to the east of Ashford in 
 the county of Kent.The village is to  
 be found in pleasant countryside at   
 the foot of the North Downs.          
   Many people like to stroll along the
 North Downs Way overlooking the       
 village taking in the view stretching 
 beyond Ashford to the west,over Romney
 Marsh,and on to Dungeness in the      
 south.                                
   The area is given over mainly to    
 farmland,there being very few         
 amenities here.Within the village is  
 the church of St.Mary's,a kilometre or
 so to the west,down a short lane is   
 the primary school,whilst further to  
 the west at Bircholt Forstal is the   
 village hall which also serves the    
 nearby villages of Brabourne Lees and 
 Smeeth.                               
                                       </content>
