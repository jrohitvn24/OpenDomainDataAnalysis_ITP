		<title>04Newbold Eyre Chapel</title>
		<content>  Newbold is the first of the Royal    
 Manors in Derbyshire listed in the    
 Domesday Book, &amp; was assessed with its
 six berewicks of which Chesterfield   
 was one. Now the name is preserved as 
 a district to the north of town and   
 was acquired by Anthony &amp; Gervase Eyre
 in 1570. Originally known as the      
 'Chapel of Newbold', the so-called    
 'Eyre Chapel' which existed before    
 being owned by the Eyres, was severely
 damaged in 1688 when sacked by a mob  
 and suffered desecration by its use as
 a cow house and barn. The Eyre family 
 cleared it out but by 1875 it was     
 described as utterly desolate. Its    
 only furniture is a modern wooden     
 altar and raised dais at the east end.
 Today the dilapidated Chapel still    
 stands with all the doors &amp; windows   
 boarded up on a small piece of land   
 behind the Nags Head public house.    </content>
