 We went into this room.               
 Four old ladies sat there, silent.    
 Don't suppose they heard or saw us,   
 They just sat there.                  
                                       
                                       
 "Mind if we ask some questions for    
 The Domesday Project," we asked.      
 "no" came a crackly reply.            
 She loved the home !                  
                                       
 Then we interviewed the owner.        
 "Ninety is the average age.           
 Between them they have lived two      
 Thousand one hundred and sixty years."
 Relatives are a big problem she said. 
 Old age is a problem,  I thought.
