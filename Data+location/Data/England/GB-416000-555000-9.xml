		<content> There are several places of worship   
 in the vicinity. In Burnopfield itself
 there is St.James'Parish Church which 
 is Church of England,a Gospel         
 Fellowship Hall and  Haswell Methodist
 Chapel.In nearby Byermoor there is a  
 Roman Catholic Church and in Tanfield 
 Village is St. Margaret's which is    
 also Church of England.               
   Originally the Parish was contained 
 within the Parish of Tanfield.it was  
 in 1872 that the Parish of Burnopfield
 was separated from Tanfield and it    
 appears that in 1873 the church of    
 St.James was largely completed.       
   A march is held each year on        
 St.George's Day from St.James'Church  
 Hall to the War Memorial.The          
 Cubs,Brownies,Scouts,Guides and Boy's 
 Brigade form a large part of the      
 parade.                               
                                       </content>
