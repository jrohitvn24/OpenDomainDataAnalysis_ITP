 Of the twelve farms in our area that  
 are still inhabited, all but two are  
 farmed extensively   and provide the  
 income necessary for the occupiers.   
                                       
   The land provides rough grazing for 
 cattle and sheep, meadows for         
 hay-making, and most of the farmers   
 keep additional horses and fowls.     
                                       
   Everyone we spoke to said they liked
 living there because of the pleasant  
 scenery  and the peace and quiet, but 
 very few had time for any leisure     
 activities. Those who had walked,     
 listened to music or tinkered with    
 their vehicles.
