		<content>        There are three main rock types
 in the Addington area, Chalk (porous) 
 Blackheath Beds (pervious) and Thanet 
 Sands (impermeable). All three rock   
 types are sedimentary and the region  
 has been gently folded. Because       
 of the variety of rocks, Addington    
 spring is found at Spout Hill where   
 the Blackheath Beds and Thanet Sands  
 meet. The spring provided water for   
 the village although today it is not  
 used. Quarrying existed during the    
 last century. Both chalk and gravel   
 pits were excavated. There are no     
 quarries mined today, they are used as
 bunkers on the local golf course. The 
 land use has changed during the last  
 century, large housing estates have   
 replaced arable farmland. There are no
 industries in Addington except for    
 farming. Arable farming, pasture and  
 market gardening are dominant.        </content>
