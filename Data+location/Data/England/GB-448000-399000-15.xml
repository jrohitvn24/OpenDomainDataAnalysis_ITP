		<title>15Shopping in a mining village</title>
		<content> There are not many shops in Denaby.The
 biggest is a food{supermarket}built in
 1960, and we have a general store that
 is open all hours.There is a{chemist,}
 a{post office,}electrical,a fishing   
 tackle shop and a video rental shop.We
 have to go out of Denaby for things   
 like doors,carpets,settees and other  
 big things around the house.Anything  
 else people need they have to go to   
 another town.This means that money is 
 taken away from our town without any  
 being brought back in.When{customers} 
 buy things from a shopkeeeper, that is
 his wages, but subsidized transport   
 encourages people to go to other      
 places to shop so jobs are lost. Our {
{open market}is owned privately. On    
 Fridays and Tuesday traders sell      
 fruit, clothing,sea food,pictures,    
 secondhand goods,meat household       
 goods,vegetables,toys and footwear.   </content>
