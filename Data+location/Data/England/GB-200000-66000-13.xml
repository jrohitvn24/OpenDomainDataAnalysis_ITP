		<title>13SUMMER FAIR</title>
		<content> Our usual P.T.A. Summer Fair was held 
 on the evening of the first Friday in 
 July.The theme this year was 'Clowns'.
 Rev.Dawes,the Methodist               
 Minister,opened the Fair and was      
 presented with a buttonhole and a     
 bouquet for his wife.His first task   
 was to judge the very good turn out of
 clowns.The fun continued with         
 stalls,sideshows and competitions.Mark
 and Anthony were the targets for      
 custard pies and took turns to stand  
 in a pillory.The most popular event   
 for children was the pillow fight,    
 where opponents do their best to knock
 each other off a bar with pillows.    
 Entertainment was provided by{Bodmin  
{Junior Band}and the"{Offchants}".Hot  
 dogs,hamburgers and onions were sold  
 out.A great evening finished with     
 sheaf tossing.Nearly all the village  
 came.My Mum chatted with everyone.    </content>
