		<content> My mum goes to work. She works at the 
 hospital. She is a nurse. My dad goes 
 to work, his job is building houses   
 and mending pipes and putting them in 
 the ground. Every Sunday we go to the 
 swimming baths and every Saturday we  
 have a new toy. After school I play   
 out and sometimes we go on the Downs  
 with our dogs. Every night I read my  
 school book. When we are off school we
 sometimes go to the beach. When it is 
 my birthday  we go to the pictures and
 go to McDonalds with a friend.
