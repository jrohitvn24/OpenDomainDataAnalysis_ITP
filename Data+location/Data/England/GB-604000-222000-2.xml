		<title>02WIVENHOE 40 YEARS AGO</title>
		<content>   On Tuesday 7th May, 1985, Jane and  
 I went to interview Jane's Grandma and
 Grandad. We wanted to ask them some   
 questions about life in Wivenhoe as it
 used to be.                           
   They told us they had moved into    
 Wivenhoe in 1945. We asked them how   
 Wivenhoe had changed over the years.  
 Jane's Grandad said there were too    
 many houses nowadays. He also said    
 that he liked Wivenhoe better today   
 because it is a wider community.      
   We asked, "What possessions do you  
 have now which you would not have had 
 years ago?"                           
   They replied, "Television; also most
 people have a car and own their own   
 house which they did not do then."    
   We asked Jane's Grandma, "What was  
 the population of Wivenhoe when you   
 first came?"                          
                                       </content>
