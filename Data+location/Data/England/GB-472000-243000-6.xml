 of out-door games, a long list of     
 games was compiled. On closer         
 inspection it was soon revealed that  
 most of these were just variations of 
 traditional games. The game 'It'was   
 decribed as '60 in', 'torture',       
 'monsters'. British Bulldog was       
 popular as were many other chasing    
 games. Spinning tops and hoops were no
 longer popular although some girls    
 still skipped. Individuals played     
 with a football or roller skates and  
 many children used their bicycles a   
 lot .

 rest of the group line up against a   
 fence or wall. The person chosen calls
 out a name and this is a signal for   
 that person to run across. If he or
