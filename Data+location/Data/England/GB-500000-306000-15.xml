		<content> Stamford is easily reached from most  
 parts of Britain due to its situation 
 near the A1. Many tourists stay in its
 historical surroundings.              
 They enjoy its Georgian architecture, 
 Burghley house, the ancient churches, 
 Stamford Museum and the Shakespeare   
 open-air plays. Stamford offers good  
 facilities for the tourist- it has    
 several first class hotels, for       
 instance the Lady Anne and the George 
 Hotel, which used to be a coaching inn
 in the olden days. There are also many
 private houses which offer B&amp;B        
 accomodation, as well as numerous     
 eating places and public houses.      
 Many visitors are continental or      
 American.
