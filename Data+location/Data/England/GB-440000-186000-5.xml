 Early ,on June 23rd,1985 some people  
broke a window at the back of the hall 
at Icknield Hall of Wantage School.    
 They entered the staffroom,put paper  
on the chairs and set fire to it.The   
seats are made of foam so they gave off
fumes. Some people living nearby saw   
the flames and smoke and gave the      
alarm.                                 
 There was a footprint outside.The     
staffroom  could not be used.Music     
Workshop was cancelled that day.       
 My dad, who teaches there,had his     
photograph in the Wantage Herald with a
group of people who helped to clear up 
after the fire.
