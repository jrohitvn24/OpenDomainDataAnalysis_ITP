		<content>{  Cross Lake Swim Friday 12th July    
 Once a year{Troutbeck Bridge Swimming 
{Club}organises a swim across Lake     
 Windermere. At{6pm}there is a briefing
 and then everyone rows across to the  
 other side of the lake,opposite to    
 Millerground. When all the swimmers   
 have been covered in Vaseline they get
 in the water in a line and the        
 starting gun goes and the swimmers set
 off. The swimmers have to find their  
 boat with their{rower}and{lifesaver}in
 it. It is about 1 mile across and soon
 the swimmers are spread out. There are
{trophies}for the{first man}and the    
{first lady}across and there are also  
{records}for each{stroke.}After the    
 race everyone goes back to the pool   
 and uses the showers there. At the    
 pool there is also something to eat   
 and drink.                            
                                       </content>
