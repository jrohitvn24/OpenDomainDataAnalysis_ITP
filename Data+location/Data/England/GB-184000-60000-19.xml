		<content> The telephone in BESOUGHAN is a kiosk 
 made out of cast iron. They previously
 used glass but now they make the      
 windows is plastic and the price of   
 making a 'phone call is 10p. It has   
 windows on 3 sides of the 4. There is 
 a box inside called a 'phone and up   
 behind it there are codes so that you 
 can 'phone anywhere in the country.   
 NEWSPAPER BOX:A newspaper box is where
 newspapers are left for people to come
 and collect. It's made of wood and    
 looks like a table.                   
 In MOUNTJOY they unfortunately have   
 an as yet unsolved sewage problem,this
 is partly because the landlord cannot 
 be traced causing a major legal       
 wrangle.                              
 Most people own cars because the bus  
 services are not very good.You need a 
 car in winter more than in summer.
