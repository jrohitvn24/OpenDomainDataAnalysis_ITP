 The church was built in the mid 19th  
 Century with seating capacity for 160.
 The two manual organ is played        
 regularly, and the six bells which    
 include the second oldest tenor in    
 Devon and are rung on special         
 occasions. The Patron (19th in        
 succession) controls the Church and   
 the services are taken by the Rector  
 and Readers. The population of Marland
 is about 200 and the average          
 congregation is approximately 15. A   
 service is held every Sunday mornings.
 Special services include two harvests,
 one on weeknight followed by supper,  
 confirmations, baptisms, weddings and 
 funerals. Revels is celebrated by a   
 Garden Fete. Future plans include an  
 extension to the Church Yard and a    
 Group Parochial Church Council.
