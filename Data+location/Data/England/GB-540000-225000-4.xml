		<title>04EMPLOYMENT IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  1/3 of the people who live in the    
 village work in the village. The sort 
 of work they do is: building &lt;lots of 
 people have extensions put on their   
 home>. Gardening, some people who have
 big gardens and are rich have         
 gardeners.There are men who drive     
 round the village selling goods to    
 people.                               
  Some people do farming. It is very   
 hard work and they don't get paid very
 much money but they get a house free  
 of rent.                              
  A lady from the village runs the post
 office two afternoons a week in an    
 outhouse behind the vicerage.         
  Some mothers do part time cleaning.  
 Several fathers work at Stansted      
 airport and in Bishops Stortford or   
 London. Some Dads work at the Brewery 
 lifting barrels and brewing beer.
