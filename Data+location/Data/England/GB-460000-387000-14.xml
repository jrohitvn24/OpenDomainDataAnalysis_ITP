		<title>14SERLBY HALL</title>
		<content> Serlby Hall is an elegant red brick   
 house situated in a most attractive,  
 well wooded park about 2 miles north  
 of Blyth, just off the A614. The house
 was built in 1740 for John Monkton,   
 the first Viscount Galway, a          
 descendant of an ancient family which,
 prior to that date, had occupied      
 various seats in the nearby county of 
 Yorkshire for over five hundred years.
 Many of the contents of Serlby are    
 connected with earlier members of the 
 family.The original home of the family
 was at Monckton, near York.One of the 
 interesting features of the contents  
 of Serlby is the fine collection of   
 English and continental porcelains to 
 be seen around the house.             
 The new owner of the Hall is Major    
 Berry who it is thought no longer     
 opens the house to the public.
