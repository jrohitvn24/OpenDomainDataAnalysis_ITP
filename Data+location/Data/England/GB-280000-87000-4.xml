		<title>04ST.MARY'S CHURCH DUNSFORD</title>
		<content> The first church in Dunsford was      
 dedicated in 1261 but the present     
 building was erected between 1420 and 
 1455.The font is origional,about 1430.
 Three windows in the North Aisle have 
 some very old glass displaying shields
 of Moreton and Bosum and the figures  
 of St.Helena,St.Barbara and St.       
 Catherine.This aisle contains the     
 Fulford family pew which was at one   
 time a side chapel.The pew contains a 
 very fine monument to Thomas Fulford  
 and his family.The bells were cast in 
 1785 and have been recast and rehung  
 in a steel frame in 1978.The gallery  
 is Jacobean.It was strengthened by a  
 30 ft.oak beam grown in Powderham Park
 and two under the organ,with a cross  
 beam resting on oak pillars between   
 the original stone pillars.
