		<title>09BOYHOOD MEMORIES OF SHEFFORD</title>
		<content> Eighty years have now passed away and 
 what a difference in the ways of how  
 we live.Ten shillings a week for the  
 work we did and how many firms pay    
 over a hundred pounds weekly now.     
       Rents were from a shilling      
 weekly and no motor cars for the      
 working man, just a few for the better
 off. Roads were swept with a besom and
 dusty streets watered by water cart.  
 Goods were delivered by a small pony  
 and cart or by a boy with a basket on 
 his arm.A large order would be        
 delivered weekly in a four wheeled,   
 covered van.                          
        The rivers often flooded the   
 streets and the shops.We were carried 
 into Shefford by men with long        
 leggings and waterproof coats.
