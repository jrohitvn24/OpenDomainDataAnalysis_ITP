   Two ball is where you get two balls 
 and throw them at a wall and there are
 many types of games that you can play.
 Here are some of the different        
 variations:-                          
   1) You stand still and throw the    
 balls at the wall.Every time you throw
 the ball you either form a cross with 
 your arms and put them to your chest  
 or just clap your hands then catch the
 ball.                                 
   2) Throw the balls at the wall then 
 when you have caught them throw them  
 into the air then back at the wall    
 then up in the air again then under   
 your legs and start again.
