		<title>15TRANSPORT - RURAL</title>
		<content> BEING A RURAL AREA PUBLIC TRANSPORT   
 HAS BEEN REDUCED OVER RECENT YEARS    
 DUE MAINLY TO LACK OF SUPPORT.        
 IN SPRATTON THE BUS SERVICE IS VERY   
 POOR. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FIVE    
 BUSES PER DAY INTO NORTHAMPTON.       
 BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH PUBLIC   
 TRANSPORT, THERE IS A HIGH RATIO OF   
 CAR OWNERSHIP IN THE AREA. MOST       
 FAMILIES OWN ONE CAR AND APPROXIMATELY
 25% ARE TWO CAR FAMILIES.             
 TEENAGERS ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY
 THE LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT AS THERE 
 IS VERY LITTLE SOCIAL LIFE FOR THEM IN
 THE VILLAGES. MANY OWN MOPEDS AND     
 SMALL MOTORBIKES WHICH THEY MAY       
 LEGALLY RIDE AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN.   
 A DAILY SCHOOL BUS IS PROVIDED FOR    
 OLDER CHILDREN WHO ATTEND GUILSBOROUGH
 COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL BUT PRIMARY      
 SCHOOL CHILDREN ENJOY NO SUCH         
 PROVISION.                            </content>
