		<title>13MARKETS, LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> Lincoln  has always been a{market town
 and in the Middle Ages various markets
 were  held  in the  walled town on the
 hillside, giving the  name to  many of
 the  streets. In the 18th  century the
{Butter Market}was built but this began
 to fall to bits after 200 years so the
{Cornhill  Market  Hall}was  erected in
 1935.This has been expanded today with
 the  addition  of  a  glass  covered  
 section. One part is owned by the{city
{Corporation}and the other is{privately
 owned. The  market  sells  virtually  
 everything  a  shopper  could  want,  
 fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, cheese,
 clothes , books and so on.Thousands of
 people from a wide area use the market
 each  year. A  famous  American  fast-
 food restaurant lures customers in.The
 square  outside  is  often  used  for 
 meetings, soap  box preachers, street 
 artists or just for having a breather.</content>
