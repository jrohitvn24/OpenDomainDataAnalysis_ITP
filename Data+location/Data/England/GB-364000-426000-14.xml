		<title>14OLD PEOPLE 2.</title>
		<content> Most of the{old people}at the home we 
 visited{worked at the mills.}They     
 worked from 6.00am to 7.00pm.One old  
 lady worked at a mill on{Sterling St.}
 She earned{30 shillings}but another   
 old lady only earned 12 shillings     
 which is now 60p.This isn't worth as  
 much as you can imagine.              
 When the{2nd World War}broke out some 
 of the children had to{stop working}in
 the mills instead they worked more    
 locally.{Mrs.Hughes}for instance      
 worked in a{confectioners.}All the    
 young men went to fight in the war and
 all the{older men}helped in the{Home  
{Guard.}Their job was to{look after}the
 women and children.They were like     
 policemen,firemen and ambulance men   
 all in one.When the{war ended}there   
 were big{celebrations}with the family.
 They also had{street parties.
