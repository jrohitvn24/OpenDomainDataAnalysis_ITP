		<title>05PARK FARM DAIRY:MRS.WILKINS</title>
		<content>   She has lived there for 62 years,and
 has lived in the area all her life as 
 generations of her family had done    
 before her.She runs the farm by       
 herself which has 60 cows producing   
 300 litres of milk daily,35 of which  
 are calves.Her only form of transport 
 is a Mini Metro car as no public      
 transport passes through the area.She 
 lives alone with her pet dog as her   
 only son and daughter have left       
 home.The techniques of farming have   
 improved over the years eg.milking    
 machinery and production of silage.   
 Mrs.Wilkins has never been abroad and 
 only had one holiday 28 years ago.A   
 Roman Villa had been found a couple of
 fields away from her.The real locals, 
 like herself ,are still left in the   
 area .She said she would like to stay 
 in the area for ever!
