		<title>09THE SCHOOL IN PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> Built in 1873 this two teacher        
 Victorian school was under threat of  
 closure in 1983. Village action group 
 managed to delay the closure by a two 
 year review. During this time the     
 school had to show that it was educa- 
 tionally and financially viable. In   
 January 1985 the school achieved this 
 objective and now has 41 pupils. A    
 further classroom is being added and  
 numbers will hopefully rise to 60+ so 
 necessitating a third teacher. The    
 school at present is divided into two 
 classes, Class 1 for 5-7s, Class 2 for
 7-11s. The school day begins at 9am &amp; 
 ends at 3.30pm. After school clubs    
 include Chess, Music, Netball &amp;       
 Football. Parents help voluntarily to 
 further the education of their child- 
 ren and the very active PTA holds many
 fund-raising events. The school is    
 totally integrated into the community.</content>
