		<title>16Bilston Carnival</title>
		<content>Bilston Carnival is held every year on 
the last Saturday in June. Local       
organistions,cubs,brownies etc. each   
decorate a float. Meetings are held    
weeks before to decide how each float  
will be decorated. On the morning of   
the big day all the floats assemble in 
Hckman Park to be judged. The winner   
receives a trophy &amp; 15 pounds,there are
2nd &amp; 3rd prizes too. After judging a  
local band leads a procession through  
the streets of Bilston. The floats and 
other bands follow. People line the    
streets and throw money to the floats  
they like. The money goes to charity.  
At the end the floats return to the    
park and prizes are awarded. The       
drivers of the floats are paid for     
their time in thanks. There is a Fair  
afterwards.
