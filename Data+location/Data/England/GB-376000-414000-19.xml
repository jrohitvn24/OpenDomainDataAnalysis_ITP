		<title>19LAW AND ORDER IN RAMSBOTTOM</title>
		<content> P.C. Storey joined the{police force}11
 years ago and has worked in Ramsbottom
 for 4 years. For the past year he has 
 been Area Constable responsible for   
 15500 people and almost 5000 hectares 
 of land.                              
 Ramsbottom has 2 area constables, a   
 C.I.D. officer, car patrols, dog vans 
 and an area traffic car. There are    
 police horses at Bury and Task Force  
 and{patrol cars}come into the area    
 from neighbouring Lancashire. Many    
 policemen live in Ramsbottom and      
 because it is such a{close-knit }     
{community}less crime is committed and 
 about 90% of that that is committed is
 solved. Most of the 850{crimes }      
 committed in 1984 were burglaries.    
 There has been an increase in the     
 number of muggings and thefts from    
 houses and there is concern about     
 bogus officials gaining access.       </content>
