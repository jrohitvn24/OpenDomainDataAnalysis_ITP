		<content>    The study area lies at the foot of 
 the north-western fringes of the      
 Pennines.   To the east the fells,    
 heather-covered on their flat summits 
 and bracken-covered on their steep    
 slopes, rise to over 400 metres.      
 Near the foot of these fells are the  
 villages of CASTLE CARROCK and TALKIN.
   These lie on undulating ground      
 formed at the end of the ice-age by   
 the deposition of fairly sandy        
 material.                             
    The river Gelt, rising on the local
 fells, drains the area.   This river, 
 which can rise rapidly after heavy    
 rain, has cut a deep valley for       
 itself, and is bordered by thick,     
 deciduous woods.                      
    Most of the lowland is a mosaic of 
 small fields, bordered by stone walls 
 nearer the fells and by hedges towards
 the west.                             </content>
