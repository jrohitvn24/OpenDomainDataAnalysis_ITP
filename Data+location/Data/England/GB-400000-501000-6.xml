		<title>06GAMEKEEPING IN THE DALE.</title>
		<content> Much of this area is open moorland    
 used for grouse shooting. A{gamekeeper
 and{underkeeper}care for{10,000 }     
{acres}of moor which is owned by a     
 Swede.  The gamekeeper gets up early  
 to shoot foxes and to set{fen traps}to
 kill stoats.  The fox and stoats would
 kill the grouse chicks and the stoats 
 eat the eggs.  In March, before the   
 grouse start laying, the heather is   
 burnt. This encourages fresh growth   
 and insects for the chicks to feed on.
 Every year 500 acres of heather are   
 burnt. To do this the gamekeeper takes
 heather burners and heather beaters   
 onto the moor. The burners are a stick
 with a cloth tied onto the end. This  
 is soaked in paraffin. The beater puts
 out the fire. Other jobs that the     
 gamekeeper does are the training of   
 his dogs, building shooting butts and 
 maintaining the moor roads.           </content>
