		<content> put).  When he is in the feather room 
 he walks into the herding pen and     
 picks up a piece of wood with a hook  
 on the end and catches a turkey with  
 it.  Then he takes the turkey into the
 killing room and kills it.  When it is
 dead he takes it into the feather room
 and plucks off its feathers.  When it 
 is plucked he does that to the rest of
 the turkeys.  When the turkeys are all
 plucked he puts them into the freezer.
 The person plucks 50 turkeys in the   
 morning and 75 turkeys in the         
 afternoon.  When he is finished he    
 gets cleaned up and goes home.        
    After they are plucked, someone    
 comes round collecting the feathers.  
 They are then taken behind the sheds  
 and petrol is put all over them and   
 they are burned.                      
    The turkeys are sold mostly at     
 Christmas and Easter.                 </content>
