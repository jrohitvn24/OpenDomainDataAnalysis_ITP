		<content>{Housing in this area falls into three 
 main categories:-                     
 (1) Traditional stone built farmhouses
 and cottages and small terraced houses
 seen in Abbotsham. These are well     
 maintained and fully occupied. In the 
 main street one of the houses serves  
 as village stores and post office.    
 (2) The larger, mainly Victorian      
 houses nearer Westward Ho!,many of    
 which date from the days of the       
 Imperial Services College.            
 (3) New housing,mainly in the form of 
 Bungalows and detached houses,situated
 mostly in Abbotsham and on the        
 Londonderry and Moreton Park Estates  
 nearer Bideford. Most of this growth  
 has taken place in the last fifteen   
 years.
