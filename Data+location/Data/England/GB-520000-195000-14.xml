		<content> We like to play 'had' or 'tally-ho'   
 the best. In 'had' someone is 'it' and
 they have to chase after you and try  
 to catch you. In 'tally-ho' one group 
 of children stand in line in the      
 playground and someone is 'it'. They  
 pick one of the children in the line. 
 That person has to reach the end of   
 the playground before the person who  
 is 'it' catches them. If they make it,
 the others from the line run down. If 
 the person is 'hadded' they are 'it'  
 with the first person and another     
 child is picked from the line to be   
 chased. The object of the game is to  
 try to be the last person caught. At  
 3.30pm we finish school. When I get   
 home I play with my friend, Paul      
 Eddicott. At 9.0pm I go to bed. I read
 for a while and then go to sleep.
