		<title>02Streetly Cub Camp</title>
		<content> On the 21st June we, the 31st Streetly
 Cub pack went to the Beaudesert camp  
 site at Gentleshaw. Nearly all our cub
 pack went. When everybody was there we
 went into our tents and unloaded our  
 kit. Afterwards one of our leaders    
 called Woody and I helped to build a  
 swing and then we played on it. Then  
 we went down to the woods and went    
 into the rododendron bushes and Budgie
 said they were man eating flowers and 
 got one and pretended to make them eat
 me and everyone started laughing, even
 I did. Then we went down into the     
 Arena and there were  muddy slopes    
 and David Jones slipped down and got  
 muddy. Then we had to come back and   
 have supper which was oxtail soup then
 we had to go to the wash rooms and me 
 and my friend just pretended to       
                                       
                                       </content>
