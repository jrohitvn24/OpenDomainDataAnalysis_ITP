		<content>    Many people take up sports, join   
 clubs or have collections to fill     
 up spare time.                        
    There are many junior football     
 teams in our area. Also there are     
 organisations i.e.scouts, guides for  
 young people. There are also youth and
 sports clubs.                         
    In Little Hadham there is a Disco  
 on a regular basis.                   
    In a survey involving 1H &amp; 1WT the 
 most popular collections were *stamps 
 (10) and *Models (8); the most popular
 sports were *swimming (22) and *horse 
 riding (10); the most popular clubs   
 and organisations were *youth clubs   
 (18) and *youth football (7).         
    The youngsters living in the       
 villages were less able to play with  
 their friends from School than those  
 in the town due to the problems of    
 transport. By Tom Pearson 1H.         </content>
