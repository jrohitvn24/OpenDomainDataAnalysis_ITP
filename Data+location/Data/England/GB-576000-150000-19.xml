		<title>19POLICE AT PARKWOOD</title>
		<content> P.C.Navaro is a local policeman. He   
 rides a bicycle so that he can talk to
 people more easily and they to him. He
 has been in the police force for over 
 7{years and in Maidstone for 4 years. 
{He patrols all of Parkwood and has    
{arrested over 100 people there. He    
{says that, being a community          
{policeman, he can be called on at any 
{time of the day or night. The 12-week 
{training, he adds, was very hard, both
{physically and mentally.              
 Next to the West Kent Police HQ on the
 Sutton Road is an estate of houses    
 originally built for the police. Many 
 now prefer to buy their own houses,   
 however, so the empty ones are let to 
 KCC employees while they are looking  
 for accommodation. Nearby are garages 
 for the repair of police vehicles, and
 a centre, complete with skid pan, for 
 the training of police drivers.       </content>
