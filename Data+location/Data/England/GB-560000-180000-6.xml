		<title>06Miss Shepherd of N.Stifford.</title>
		<content> When interviewed Miss Shepherd said   
 she had lived in N.Stifford for 30yrs 
 The cottage she lives in was a small  
 part of  a once, much larger one.She  
 came to the area to teach.            
     Miss Shepherd loves nature and the
 countryside,she gets many small       
 animals and birds visiting her garden.
 Once,she had a magpie nesting in a    
 blackbird's nest.There have been      
 badgers too.One night some years ago, 
 she heard a banging noise,only to find
 in the morning that the badgers had   
 demolished a newly erected fence put  
 up by her neighbours, which happened  
 to be across the badgers run.         
     Miss Shepherd is a keen potter and
 makes and decorates mugs.             
     The cottage was once a post office
 but it closed in 1900,now it is called
 'The Old Post Cottage'It was prior to 
 that a 'tied' cottage. by V.Clark.    </content>
