		<content> was no machinery about the time of    
 the war not like there is today.Horses
 used to do all the work.{Milking}was  
 done by hand,not by machinery.In      
{school}it was very hard and strict.The
 girls would once a week go to cookery 
 classes in either Ruddington or       
 Keyworth.The big classroom was divided
 into two by a curtain.In the top end  
 near the entrance the 6 and 7 year old
 children worked and on the other side 
 of the curtain the 8 to 14 year olds  
 worked.The playground was not         
 smooth,flat tarmac,it was bumpy and   
 rough.The school is very different    
 today.There is now a cabin across the 
 playground where the Lower Juniors    
 work.The girls and boys in the juniors
 go swimming every Monday to Keyworth  
 swimming baths.None of the teachers   
 lives in the school house;it is now   
 privately owned.                      </content>
