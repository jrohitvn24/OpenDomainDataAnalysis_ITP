The village of Gayton is perched on the
brow of a hill overlooking Northampton.
The hill is the highest point in south 
Northamptonshire. In fact, eastwards   
there is not a higher elevation until  
the Russian Steppes.                   
The village, which is surrounded by    
fields containing cereal crops and     
dairy grazing can be entered by one of 
five roads from the North, South, East,
South-East and West illustrating its   
importance as a focal point to the     
community in the past, most likely a   
manorial centre. The roads meet at a   
point in the village called "Five      
Ways".                                 
 The original manor house had direct   
access to the church which dates from  
the twelth century. The latter still   
contains a smaller door facing the     
present manor house.                   </content>
