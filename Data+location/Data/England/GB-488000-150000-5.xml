		<title>05Disused Gravel Pits.</title>
		<content>   During the past 30 years gravel has 
 been extracted from the area. The     
 gravel is now worked out and the pits 
 have become full of water and formed  
 several small lakes. The ownership is 
 shared by Surrey County Council and   
 private companies.                    
   The largest lake is used for        
 wind-surfing and boating. Others are  
 stocked for fishing, namely carp,     
 tench, roach, rudd and perch. There is
 also a trout pond. Permits are issued 
 annually and the facilities provided  
 attract enthusiasts from all over the 
 South-East.
