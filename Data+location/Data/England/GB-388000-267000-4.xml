		<content> The majority of houses in this rural  
 area are spacious, detached and owner 
 occupied. The few tennanted           
 properities normally have agricultural
 connections and are more likely to be 
 smaller and semi-detached. Some       
 detached houses were originally two   
 semis. Many houses have been          
 modernised and extended. All houses   
 have at least one bathroom. All houses
 have gardens, some extending to       
 several acres. The buildings date from
 all periods, the earliest are timber  
 framed, later brick was used. Modern  
 properties are often bungalows. At    
 least eight households have lived in  
 the same house for over twenty years, 
 one over fifty years, the majority for
 over ten years, six families have     
 moved here within the last two years  
 in each case they came from a Midlands
 industrial town.                      </content>
