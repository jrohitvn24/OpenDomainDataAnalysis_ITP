		<content> The area in question is lying on a    
 small part of{that much-weathered     
{chalk outcrop}that covers South East  
 lowland England in a range of hills   
 known more locally as{the Chilterns.  
 Beyond the area to the North and South
 vales spread extensively.Hence the    
{local sub-rock consists of chalk and  
{clay.}Immediately to the North,the    
{urbanised Hitchin Gap}marks an interr-
 uption in the chalk outcrop where the 
 Chilterns end and the more exposed    
 Cambridgeshire-facing East Anglian    
 Heights begin.Thus our area is a fine 
 example of{chalk upland scenery}of the
 more wooded North Hertfordshire       
 variety.{The relief is undulating}and 
 at times scarps weave an irregular    
 East to West trail.In other words some
 familiar downland scenery is to be    
 found - open country meeting woods,dry
 valleys and few surface streams.      </content>
