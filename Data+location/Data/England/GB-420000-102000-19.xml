		<content> In Burley most of the landscape is    
 heathland. Then it is forest and last 
 of all residential. The trees in the  
 forest are conifers,ash,beech,oak and 
 fir.Historically one of the most      
 interesting buildings in Burley       
 is the Burley Manor which is a        
 hotel.It has got a swimming pool round
 the back.The Manor has recently been  
 built because it was burnt down in    
 1936.It was first built in 1251.In the
 Victorian times the Queen's Head pub  
 and inn was built,with a smithy on the
 east end.In 1900 the inn was altered  
 and the smithy moved to the west end. 
 The Burley Grange is owned by the     
 Butchers.The Grange has a lot of acres
 and they also have a tennis court.Next
 to the Grange there is a cottage      
 called the Burley Grange cottage.There
 is an old well called Ladywell at     
 Burley Street.                        </content>
