		<title>16BUS SERVICES</title>
		<content> The bus service count for several of  
 the squares in our block is three or  
 four, a good example of how misleading
 bald statistics can be, since some of 
 the buses only run one day a week.    
  The{LINCOLNSHIRE ROAD CAR}runs from  
 Grantham through{Little Bytham}and    
{Careby}to Stamford twice a day, Monday
 to Friday. It now returns by different
 routes in the morning and afternoon,  
 thus qualifying as two services.      
{ Holywell}has one{BLAND'S}bus from    
 Oakham to Stamford (and back) on a    
 Wednesday, two on a Friday and two on 
 a Saturday. The Saturday service also 
 visits{Careby}and{Little Bytham.      
  A{DELAINE}bus runs from Bourne to    
 Stamford market (and back) via{Little 
{Bytham}and{Careby}on a Friday.        
  There are school and works buses. The
 children from{Careby}travel to{Little 
{Bytham}Primary School by taxi.        </content>
