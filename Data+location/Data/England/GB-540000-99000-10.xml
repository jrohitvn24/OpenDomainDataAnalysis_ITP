 In Peacehaven the population is       
 growing so rapidly that the three     
 schools, Hoddern Junior, Peacehaven   
 Infants and Telscombe Cliffs Primary  
 are having to take in more pupils, so 
 are gradually having less and less    
 room in the schools.  Therefore it has
 been decided that a fourth school will
 be built next year, 1986, to take on  
 the extra number of children who are  
 living in Peacehaven.  The number of  
 children going to the three schools   
 is 1050.  There are 290 children in   
 Hoddern Junior School which is on     
 Hoddern Avenue.  240 children go to   
 Peacehaven Infants School on Roderick 
 Avenue.  Telscombe Cliffs Primary     
 School on Telscombe Cliffs Way has a  
 number of 520 children.  The fourth   
 school - Primary - will be built to   
 hold approximately 240 children.      </content>
