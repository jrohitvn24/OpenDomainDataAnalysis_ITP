		<content>   The site of the town is on a hill   
 of{Bagshot sand},100 m above sea      
 level. Underlying this sand is {London
{clay}which forms the surrounding      
 lowlands. At the junction of the      
 permeable sand and the impermeable    
 clay several springs emerge and these 
 form the headstreams of rivers flowing
 eastwards into the {Rivers Wid}and{   
{Chelmer}and others westwards into the{
{Ingrebourne}and{Thames}. Thus the     
 ridge which extends northwards from   
 Brentwood is a watershed between the  
 river basins of the Thames and the    
 Chelmer.                              
   The little natural vegetation which 
 remains is largely {birch}woodland on 
 the sandy soils and{oak-hornbeam}on   
 the clays.                            
   The name appears as {Burntwood}on   
 early maps suggesting a forest        
 clearing .                            </content>
