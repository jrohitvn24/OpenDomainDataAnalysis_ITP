		<title>11TALKING TO OUR VICAR</title>
		<content> We went to the Rectory in Cheveley    
 where Reverand Davis lives. He is the 
 Rector of St Mary's CofE Church. He   
 told us about his job and what he does
 in his spare time. He does things like
 gardening, embroidery and reading. He 
 works as a full time priest, going to 
 meetings and visiting the ill in      
 hospital. He also christens, marries  
 and buries people as well as running  
 the normal church services. Mr Davis's
 wife runs the Climbers' Club-a group  
 something like Sunday School.         
 We asked him why he chose to be a     
 vicar. He said,"I didn't, but         
 something inside me made me do it." He
 has been at Cheveley for 2\years.     
 The church is being repaired at the   
 moment. One of the stained glass      
 windows, the tower, and one of the    
 walls are being repaired. The cost    
 will be about Â£57,000.                </content>
