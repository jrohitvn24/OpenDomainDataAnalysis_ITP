		<title>18WRITTLE, KING JOHN'S PALACE</title>
		<content> Undoubtedly one of Writtle's most     
 important historic sites is the moated
 area known as King John's Palace. The 
 area is situated within the grounds of
 the Agricultural College and has been 
 preserved to show the moat.           
           It was originally built by  
 King John in the year 1211. Detailed  
 records of the royal household        
 expenditure for the time show that the
 original lodge was built at a cost of 
 Â£13.6s.8d.                            
           King Henry the Third and    
 King Edward the First were both       
 regular visitors to the lodge and a   
 number of items from this period have 
 been found there.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
