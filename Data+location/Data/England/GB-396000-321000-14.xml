		<title>14A PUPIL-GREAT HAYWOOD SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  My name is Emma Featherstone. My age 
is ten. I live at 48 Ridgeway, Hixon,  
Staffs. I have 2 sisters, one is       
mentally handicapped. Her name is Zoe. 
She is 5 years old. She goes to a      
special school called "Marshlands". I  
have another sister called Nicola, she 
is 12. Her school is "Blessed William  
Howard".  My mum works at W.H.Smiths   
in Stafford. My dad works at           
"Palethorpes" and is a manager. My mum 
wakes me up at 7 o'clock but I always  
get up at 7.30. I have breakfast and   
wash my face, brush my teeth, brush my 
hair and then go to school. I have a   
good day. If my mum is working I go to 
Sue Corbans. If my mum is at home,then 
I go straight home. My dad has a Ford  
Granada motor car, my mum has a        
Renault.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
