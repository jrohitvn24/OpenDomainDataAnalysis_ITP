		<content> Our 12 km. block will be refered to as
 Ashurst although the block does not   
 include all the parish nor only the   
 parish.  As well as the bulge of      
 Henfield  and the area of Steyning    
 refered to above, Ashurst parish eases
 into the blocks to the north and west 
 but to no great effect.  The land     
 shows no more concern for the lines   
 surveyed by the medieval wandering    
 bounderor than it does for those drawn
 by the modern metricated computor.    
                                       
 Ashurst is rural.  It is the epitome  
 of a certain kind of soft southern    
 rurality dear to the heart of the most
 entrenched urbanite.  The names across
 the landscape - names of shaws, fields
 and the farms that ARE Ashurst for its
 300 inhabitants reach across the      
 centuries and history (cont.)
