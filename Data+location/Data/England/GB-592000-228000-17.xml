		<content> My mum, sister and I usually go to the
 supermarket, Sainsbury's, once a month
 to do our main food shopping. We get  
 all the food we think we need and put 
 most of it into our freezer. Most     
 people in this area have an{electric  
 cooker, some have{gas,}and quite a few
 also have a{microwave oven}which can  
 cook a cake in four minutes I think   
 more people in towns eat more         
 take_away food or "junk food" as it is
 called, than we do in this area, for  
 it is easier for them to visit afast  
 food shop. People here tend to eat    
 fish and chips as a treat, or if they 
 are late home from town. On a week day
 I usually start with two slices of    
 toast or cereal.At 10.20am I will have
 an apple or a few biscuits.At mid_day 
 I have two sandwiches,an apple, and a 
 piece of cake. At night I have a      
 cooked meal like{chips peas}and{bacon.</content>
