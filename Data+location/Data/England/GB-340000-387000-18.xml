		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF CLAIRE.</title>
		<content> Yesterday I woke up at 7.40 am. and I 
 got up shortly after.I went to the    
 bathroom to wash and then back to the 
 bedroom to dress and brush my hair. As
 it is long I have to have it tied back
 when in school. I went downstairs and 
 made my own breakfast which was a     
 glass of orange and a bowl of cereal. 
 When I had finished I collected my bag
 and waited for my sister and my mum   
 who drove us to school on her way to  
 work.We started school at 9.00 am.    
 with assembly, maths and break. After 
 this we had environmental studies and 
 lunch.I take a packed lunch.In the    
 afternoon we had games (athletics) and
 science.By 4.00 pm. when we finished, 
 my sister had walked from her school  
 to meet me.We went home by bus.       
 Dinner was at six when dad got home.As
 it was Tuesday we went to guides. We  
 came home at 9.30 pm. and went to bed.</content>
