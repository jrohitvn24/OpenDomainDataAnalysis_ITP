		<content>This block is cut on an East-West axis 
by The Grand Union Canal and the main  
railway line out of Paddington.        
North of the canal is the hundred years
old Queens Park Estate,an estate of two
up two down terraced houses.Streets on 
this working class estate are pleasant,
lined by mature plane trees.The modern 
Mozart Estate has been built on the    
northern part of Queens Park.          
Kensal Town has lost most of its light 
industries once associated with the    
canal.Some employment is provided by   
offices but there is a general air of  
dereliction.                           
This area has long been a resort for   
immigrants,which has resulted in a     
cosmopolitan community of Irish,West   
Indian,Asian and Morrocan peoples.This 
variety of cultures shows in,for       
instance,the variety of foodstuffs     
sold in the area.                      </content>
