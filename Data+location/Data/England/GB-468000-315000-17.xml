 whom 47% live on just three roads,Hall

 In the part of Kirby which came in our
 area,the population is approximately  
 203,most of whom live on Main Street. 
 There is a good cross-section of age  
 groups and social classes,but a very  
 low proportion of non-Europeans. In   
 Frisby there is a mixture of old and  
 newer dwellings,bungalows but no flats
 Kirby Bellars has more bungalows and a
 large house, Kirby Hall which is      
 converted into flats. The majority of 
 the working population travel daily to
 Melton,Leicester, Nottingham or       
 Grantham.
