		<title>14GEOLOGY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> The Geology of the area is entirely   
 part of the Jurrasis succerssion, 190 
 to 130 million years old.  Noted in   
 other area for its links with the     
 DINOSAURS.  No local dinosaurs have   
 been found in the immediate area but  
 nevertheless geologist around the area
 can collect a wide variety of fossile.
  Brachiopods, (Terebratula, and       
 Rhynconella) are common.  Corals      
 abound in certain bands.  Ammonites   
 are zone fossils and Belemnites       
 frequently occur.  There can be some  
 disappointments however... some strata
 contain no immediately obsevable      
 fossils.                              
                                       
 The oolite series is made of closely  
 packed grains of calcium and is named 
 from its resemblance to fish roe.     
 Other rocks contain calcite crystals  
 and stalactitic materials.  Like many </content>
