		<content> Most people are engaged in agriculture
 although some worked at the coal mine 
 at Ifton Heath.Most of the            
 agricultural workers lived in tied    
 cottages.There were no council houses 
 at that time.The proportion of tied to
 private homes was about 50-50.Today   
 there are few tied cottages and a few 
 council houses in the area.There was  
 electricity as a number of inhabitants
 bought TVs to watch the coronation of 
 Elizabeth II.The village school closed
 in 1950 and so the children had to    
 travel to St Martins.There was a      
 daily bus service to Oswestry,Wrexham 
 and Ellesmere.Buses are more frequent 
 today.Mobile shops supplied daily     
 shopping needs.Ellesmere and Oswestry 
 were visited for other shopping.      
 The nearest cinema was in Oswestry,   
 theatre at Chester.Most people had    
 radios, there were only a few TVs.    </content>
