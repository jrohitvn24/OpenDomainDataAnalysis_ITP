 when it was owned by Lord Maynard. It 
 is one of the oldest coalmines still  
 in production in the South Midlands   
 area.Coalmining developed after the   
 building of the Swannington and       
 Leicester Railway in 1832 by Robert   
 Stevenson.Coal could be delivered to  
 the City of Leicester for less than   
 50p per ton.Bagworth Colliery is      
 situated at the southern end of       
 Leicestershire Coalfield bordered by  
 the Thringstone Fault which divides   
 our area.Working conditions are       
 relatively easy.There being no gas or 
 heat and the fault pattern is not     
 excessive.The seams are all poor      
 quality.Coal is mainly for the        
 electricity and industrial markets.
