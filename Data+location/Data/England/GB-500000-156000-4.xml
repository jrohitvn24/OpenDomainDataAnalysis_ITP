		<content>{St.Nicolas Church}                    
   The church was built in 1140 out of 
 a mixture of Sarsen stone and Pudding 
 stone, though it seems likely that    
 there was an earlier Saxon church made
 of wood. It is surrounded by a        
 circular graveyard. Today the church  
 is used occasionally for weddings and 
 baptisms. Regular Sunday services at  
 11.30am are carried out and the church
 seats 130 people. The church was      
 originally used by the people of      
 Pyrford but the new village and an    
 increase in population means that a   
 new church has had to be built. Inside
 the church there is evidence of Norman
 Architecture: a fine Norman arch in   
 front of the altar and Norman windows.
 The vicarage next to the church is now
 privately owned and the old           
 schoolhouse is used for storing garden
 tools.                                </content>
