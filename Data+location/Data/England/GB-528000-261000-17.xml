		<content> Policing of the two villages is       
 carried out from the police station at
 Papworth Everard. The Community       
 Policeman is very much in evidence    
 either driving round or through the   
 villages. He will stop and chat to    
 people, and often visits the schools  
 to talk informally or formally to the 
 children. In this way it is hoped to  
 make him a more approachable figure   
 than is often the case, and it gives  
 him the opportunity to keep his finger
 on the pulse of the community.
