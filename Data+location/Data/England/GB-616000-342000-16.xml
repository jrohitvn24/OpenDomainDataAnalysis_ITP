		<title>16THE PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>{The present school was built in 1906  
 and Mr. Henry Grice of Cremer Street  
 remembers the first day.   The school 
 is a collection of buildings          
 surrounded by Barford Rd.,George St., 
 and Cremer St.{It is on a very small  
{site of one acre and we have no field.
 There is a junior department of 254   
 children and an infant department of  
 154. Until 1957 the children came to  
 this school until they were 14 but    
 then the new secondary modern school  
 (now the High School) opened. We have 
 a separate craft room and a{heated    
{indoor swimming pool}which we use all 
 the year round.                       
{A NEW SCHOOL is being built}at a site 
 off Holway Road near to the High      
 School.  It will cost{Â£875,000.}It    
 will open in September 1986. We have  
 made a model of the old school and a  
 video film of the new one being built.</content>
