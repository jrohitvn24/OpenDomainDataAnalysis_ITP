		<title>01NORTH WEST AREA I.O.WIGHT</title>
		<content> The North West Area of the Isle of    
 Wight encompasses the western River   
 Yar,the old town of Yarmouth;the large
 parish of Freshwater and the hamlet   
 of  Norton. The coast line between    
 Yarmouth common and Totland Bay; sadly
 subject to coastal erosion in the most
 westerly area, has 3 piers though Fort
 Victoria and Totland are in bad       
 repair and no longer used. We have 3  
 Victorian forts, Golden Hill; Albert  
 and Victoria. The area, with 4 holiday
 camps caters largely for the tourist  
 industry.Yarmouth is the most westerly
 of the 3 ports of entry with an hourly
 ferry service in winter; half hourly  
 in summer bringing in passengers,cars 
 and freight. Excursion boats from the 
 mainland bring visitors to the pier   
 and town in the summer.
