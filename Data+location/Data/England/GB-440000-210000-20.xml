These pages about Freeland and Church  
Hanborough were written by the upper   
juniors at Eynsham Primary School.     
There are about 90 children aged 9 to  
11 in the upper juniors and during the 
months of June and July we went in     
small groups in the minibus to look at 
different things.                      
                                       
We would like to thank the upper       
juniors at Freeland Primary School,    
Miss Breakspear of St.Mary's Church,   
Miss Gibson at Church Hanborough,      
Mr.Symington of Cook's Corner Farm,    
Mr.Webster of Webster's Nurseries and  
Mr.Warburton, the manager of Isis Fish 
Farm.  Mr. and Mrs.Davidson of         
Freeland, and Mr.Jackson, head of      
Freeland Primary School also gave us a 
lot of help.
