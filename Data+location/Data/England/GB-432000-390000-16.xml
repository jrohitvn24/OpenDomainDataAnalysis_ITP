		<title>16POLICE</title>
		<content>   The community policeman for Parson  
 Cross is PC David Kidman, who has been
 in the force for 17 years. He has to  
 get involved with the people &amp; he     
 visits schools, shops &amp; generally     
 talks to the public. The police can't 
 be on every street corner so they rely
 on the people for information.        
   At the Niagra Ground the police have
 recreational facilities including     
 squash courts, snooker tables, weight 
 training &amp; a football &amp; rugby pitch.  
 We also saw a bar which was open to   
 the public.                           
   We then moved onto the dogs &amp; horses
 which were very tall. The ones in the 
 stables had been sent down for a rest 
 after being fully trained. We saw the 
 best saddles &amp; helmets that are used  
 for shows &amp; displays. They think that 
 horses are better at keeping law &amp;    
 order because you cant push them over.</content>
