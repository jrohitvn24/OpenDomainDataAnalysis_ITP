		<content>    On Friday 14th June{Paul and I     
 arrived at{Brindsby Agricultural      
{College, Adversane, West Sussex for   
 the{District Cub Camp.                
    We went to bed at 10 p.m. but we   
 only slept for about three hours      
 because we were so excited.           
    The next morning we started our    
 activities. There were five bases with
 different activities at each. We were 
 given 15 minutes at each base.        
   Base 1 - we had to make and fly a   
 kite                                  
   Base 2 - cross an assault course    
   Base 3 - follow ropes bindfolded    
   Base 4 - make a collage from plants 
 and leaves                            
   Base 5 - a treasure hunt            
                                       
    We were awarded points for how well
 we worked, we came first with 82      
 points and won the Camper's Shield.   </content>
