		<title>04Cappleside- a Rathmell farm</title>
		<content>    This large and beautiful{stone }   
{farmhouse}dates back to the early     
 seventeenth century.A Georgian facade 
 and several extensions were added     
 after the Napoleonic Wars and a{school
{room}(known as Aunt Laura's Folly) was
 built in 1900.                        
    Built on a sheltered site on the   
 outskirts of Rathmell, it is commonly 
 regarded as being the unofficial      
 "manor house" of the village. There is
 no Lord of the Manor as such but the  
 house has been in the{Geldard family }
 since the early nineteenth century and
 the head of that family has always    
 been one of the important people in   
 village life.                         
    The whole estate is over 1300 acres
 comprising  several  tenant  farms  as
 well as the main one.
