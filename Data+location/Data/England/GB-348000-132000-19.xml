		<content> This is an unusual site for a business
 which is concerned with the hiring of 
 large commercial vehicles, ranging    
 from 10 ton trucks to horse boxes! It 
 was started ten years ago by the      
 present managing director,Mr Brereton,
 who lives on the site. He started of  
 by selling trucks and then repairing  
 all sorts of commercial vehicles.  He 
 is now concerned with hiring them out 
 but as he still has facilities for    
 their repair he is able to undercut   
 competitors by purchasing vehicles two
 or three years old. They have a total 
 of 25 vehicles and receive contracts  
 from as far away as Bristol and       
 Wiltshire. During the Summer their    
 trucks are in demand for the          
 transporting of grain particularly.   
 They are also an M.O.T. centre for    
 comnmercial vehicles.
