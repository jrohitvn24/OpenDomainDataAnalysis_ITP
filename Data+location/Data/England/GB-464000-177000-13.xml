  40 40 is played just like Hide and   
Seek except that when the hider is     
seen,he runs back to where the counter 
was,racing the counter,and says "40 40 
save all." Then everybody comes out of 
hiding and the counter starts again.   
  To play French Elastic you need 3    
people: 2 have elastic stretched       
between their ankles and the other     
jumps in and out of the elastic saying,
"England,Ireland,Scotland,Wales,       
Inside,Outside,Inside,Tread."          
  If she does it without making a      
mistake she does it again. If she makes
a mistake she changes with one of the  
people holding the elastic. If all is  
well the elastic is moved to the legs  
and the game repeated.
