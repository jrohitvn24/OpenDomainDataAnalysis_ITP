		<title>15People in our street</title>
		<content> Most of the people in our street,     
 Woodcote Avenue,are involved in a     
 Neighbourhood Watch Organisation.The  
 idea is that a group of householders  
 band together and keep a watch on each
 others houses to protect them against 
 burglary and vandalism.               
 The idea is not to form a vigilante   
 group though and people do not patrol 
 around.                               
                                       
 All of the families are employed and  
 are English.                          
                                       
 Woodcote Avenue is a reasonably new   
 street on the St.Nicolas Park estate  
 with 'Georgian' style houses.
