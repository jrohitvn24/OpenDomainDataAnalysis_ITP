		<title>14 THE BARRACKS,MAIDSTONE</title>
		<content>    Sitting to the South of Springfield
 Mill on the{River Medway}lies the     
{Barracks,}Maidstone - an old group of 
 buildings laid out in the traditional 
 turn-of-the-century style with barrack
 blocks surrounding an open square.    
 Originally built to house the{Kent}   
{County Regiment  -The Royal West }    
{Kents ('The Buffs'),}it now houses 61 
 Support Squadron Royal Engineers which
 are part of 36 Engineer Regiment at   
 Invicta Park, Maidstone. Standing as  
 it does near the town centre, a close 
 link has developed with the           
 townspeople of Maidstone. 'The Buffs' 
 have now disbanded, but are remembered
 with affection and the Town Museum    
 also houses the{Regimental Museum.}The
 Barracks, a link with the past, may   
 soon go if plans for a new ring road  
 around Maidstone are agreed.
