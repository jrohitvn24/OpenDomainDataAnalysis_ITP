		<title>08LOCAL HISTORY. THE VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Since{1895}the small hamlet of{Burley 
{Woodhead} has changed in many ways.   
 Over the past years the hamlet has    
 grown into a small village with only  
 one shop and one pub -{The Hermit.}In{
{1895} people used to live in{Burley   
{Woodhead}due to work but now as we    
 creep into{1986}many retired people   
 live in the village along with the    
 commuters for {Leeds and Bradford.}   
 They decided to live there because of 
 the beautiful surroundings and        
 countryside. This change has also come
 about with the closing of the         
 four mills in{Burley woodhead}and the 
 conversion of the mills and houses    
 into lovely homes.                    
    The main grievence of the people   
 living in the village is the speed    
 with which the traffic travels through
 the village, exceeding the 40 mph.    
 speed limit.                          </content>
