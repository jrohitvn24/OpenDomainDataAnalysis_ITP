		<title>09TRANSPORT IN CULLOMPTON</title>
		<content>   Since the closing of the railway    
 station in the 1960s people in        
 Cullompton have had to rely on        
 buses,taxis and private cars.The buses
 run every hour during the day to and  
 from{Exeter}and some buses go through 
 to{Tiverton.}It costs Â£1.30 to go to  
 Exeter.If people wish to travel by    
 train they usually go to              
 Exeter.Inter_city trains between{     
{Bristol}and{Penzance}stop there.Trains
 to{London}go every hour.It takes 2 1/2
 hours and costs Â£19.30.               
   Motorway access has helped transport
 firms.A Mr.Heard has run his business 
 for 30 years.He has 12 lorries and    
 employs 14 people carrying animal     
 feed.He thinks his company will       
 expand,as will other similar haulage  
 firms in Cullompton.
