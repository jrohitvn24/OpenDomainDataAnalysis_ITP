 You need at least 3 people to play    
 this game.The person who is "on"      
 counts to 10.When he has finished     
 counting,he runs after someone.When he
 has caught him,the person who has been
 "tug" stands still with his legs wide 
 open.The person who is "on" goes after
 another person or he can guard the    
 person who is caught.When you guard   
 someone it is called "guarding your   
 chicken".The other players can free   
 the person who is caught by going     
 under his legs.The person who is "on" 
 has to "tig" everyone and then someone
 else is "on".
