		<title>06NETLEY MARSH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Netley Marsh Church was built in 1854.
 The vicar is Rev. George Biggs. There 
 are 10 people who sing in the Netley  
 Marsh choir.                          
  There are two church yards outside   
 the church. The first is as old as the
 church and the second was opened in   
 1940. There are 1000 people buried in 
 the cemetery. Since the church has    
 been there, there have been 10 vicars.
 There are 2 vicarages. The oldest one 
 was built in the 1860s, the second one
 was built a lot later. The organ was  
 made in 1871 in Bath. At the bottom of
 the church there is a chapel which was
 finished in 1934. The east window was 
 replaced in 1954 after the bomb which 
 shattered the window on 26th October  
 1942. The first baptism was on 29th   
 October 1854 of Rebecca Hurst.
