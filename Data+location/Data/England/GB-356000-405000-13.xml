		<title>13GIANT'S HALL FARM</title>
		<content>  The farm is to the North West of     
 Wigan on the edge of the{Beech Hill   
{Estate.}Four generations of the Gill  
 family have farmed there in the last  
 century.                              
  The owners showed us around and we   
 saw the stone house dated{1675.}We    
 saw the oak beams, an old heavy hay   
 spade and some stone cheese presses.  
  Nowadays some fields are let out to  
 grow hay and barley but the owners no 
 longer farm the land themselves.      
  The farm was here long before the    
 Beech Hill council housing estate. Two
 massive stones were the reason for the
 name 'Giant's Hall' being given to it.
