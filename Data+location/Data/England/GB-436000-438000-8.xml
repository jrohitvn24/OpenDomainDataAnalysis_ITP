		<content> Gas and electricity services were     
 first supplied to Thorner in the      
 1920's. There was even a water pump in
 Samsites ginnel.                      
                                       
 Farms and field sizes were smaller    
 before the Second World War.          
                                       
 Sanitation today is by flush toilets, 
 but residents remember ash pits and   
 the soil being taken to a special tip 
 in Thorner.                           
                                       
 There are few old residents still in  
 Thorner...the village now has many    
 people who use the village only as a  
 dormitory...they work in Leeds or     
 Wetherby or other larger towns.
