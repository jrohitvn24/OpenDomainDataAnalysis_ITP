		<content> The Clayton Hill Country Park         
 (GR 387 058) provides a picnic area in
 addition to a well signposted country 
 walk over the open Parkland area which
 will provide people with the          
 opportunity to observe a great variety
 of wildlife.                          
 In some instances guided walks are led
 throughout the year and at a variety  
 of locations, points of interest are  
 explained along the way.              
                                       
 The area comprising Keysers Estate is 
 predominantly housing with the odd    
 shop found on Old Nazeing Road. The   
 area is located NW of Lower Nazeing   
 and is relatively close to Broxbourne 
 Lido and the Railway Station.         
 This particular part of the area also 
 contained five public parks as well as
 some factories making kitchen items   
 such as sinks and cookers.            </content>
