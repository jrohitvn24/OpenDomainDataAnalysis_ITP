		<content>    Our twelve kilometre square D-block
 included a part of Acle village and   
 North Burlingham. The land was mostly 
 used for growing crops.               
    The{main crops}were sugar-beet,peas
 and barley or wheat. Two fields were  
 also planted with potatoes.           
    There was a main{road}running      
 between Norwich and Gt.Yarmouth. There
 were a few minor back roads and dusty 
 tracks leading to farms and barns.    
    There were several{farms}in our    
 block and we looked at four: King's   
 Close Farm, Trunk Hill Farm, Coxhill  
 Farm                                  
 and Newport Farm.Newport, King's Close
 and Coxhill were all in good          
 condition. We thought Trunk Hill Farm 
 was quite scruffy.                    
    There were two main{tree}          
 plantations. One was near Newport Farm
 and the other near Trunk Hill.        </content>
