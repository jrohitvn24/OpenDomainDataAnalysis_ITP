		<title>20AT THE MARKET GARDENS</title>
		<content>{The market gardens of Leasowe and     
{Moreton form a strip on the land      
{between the main Leasowe road,and the 
{coastal dunes.                        
{                                      
 At the market gardens they grow lots  
 of vegetables,fruit and flowers.They  
 also sell straw for animals and food  
 for them.We went to explore the market
 gardens and found many different      
 things growing,like                   
 Radish,Peas,Beetroot,Potatoes,Carrots,
 Cauliflowers,Onion,Spinach,Marrows.   
 After we had been to the market garden
 we went to the beach.                 
 In the afternoon we wrote about what  
 we had found that morning for the     
 Domesday Project,and it was very      
 interesting.
