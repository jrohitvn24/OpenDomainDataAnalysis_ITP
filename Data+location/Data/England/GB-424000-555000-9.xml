		<content> A Medical Centre was opened in 1969   
 and was extended in 1984. The area    
 needs to develop better facilities for
 the elderly. Shadon House caters for  
 only forty elderly residents. 1% of   
 the population of Birtley seeks help. 
 Some suffer from depression and there 
 are cases of alcoholism. There is some
 child abuse and cases of glue sniffing
 exspecially among unemployed          
 teenagers.                            
    Birtley has the largest children's 
 Home in Gateshead. It deals with      
 fostering, difficult behaviour, and   
 assessment of children's needs. There 
 is one hostel in the Borough for the  
 physically handicapped with forty     
 places.                               
    The local hospital is the Queen    
 Elizabeth just outside of Birtley.
