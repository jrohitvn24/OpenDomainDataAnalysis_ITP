		<content>     Combe Sydenham lies within the    
{Exmoor National Park.  }This Park has 
 as its symbol a Stag's head.   In many
 areas of West Somerset it is possible 
 to see the{Wild Red Deer}in its       
 natural setting.                      
     At Combe Sydenham it is also      
 possible to see the smaller and darker
{Fallow Deer.  }This is very much a    
 parkland animal and here is contained 
 within the original wrought iron      
 fence.                                
     In the hot weather it is a fine   
 sight to watch the deer resting under 
 the large beech trees.   It will be   
 noticed that these Bucks have palmated
 antlers.   The Does produce there     
 young fawns in either May or June.
