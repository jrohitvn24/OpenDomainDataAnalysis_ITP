		<title>20The Haunted House</title>
		<content> One of the houses in the village of   
 Bank, situated to the S.W. of         
 Lyndhurst was thought to be haunted.  
 One day the owner of the house was    
 digging up the garden when she found  
 some coins.   She then saw a lady with
 grey hair running up the road and she 
 had never seen her before.   Just then
 she {vanished.  }The owner told her   
 family about what she had seen but    
 nobody believed her.                  
 That night the grey haired lady ran   
 through the owner's daughter's        
 bedroom.   The people in the house    
 then left the grounds alone and a     
 conifer stands over the place where   
 the coins were found.
