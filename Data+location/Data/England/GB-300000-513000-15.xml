		<title>15CLEATOR MOOR - THE TOWN</title>
		<content> Cleator Moor is a fairly new town,    
 having grown up in the 19th century   
 to house the influx of people seeking 
 work in the iron ore mines.Most of    
 these came from Ireland which has left
 a strong Irish lilt in the accent and 
 many Irish traditions. The mines were 
 worked out long since and there are   
 many remains to be seen. Some of them 
 were dug too close to the surface of  
 the ground and caused a great deal of 
 subsidence. Large areas of housing had
 to be pulled down for safety after    
 cracks big enough to pass toast       
 through to neighbours appeared in     
 house walls.                          
 The path of the old railways remain   
 and can be walked along. These were   
 dismantled when the mining finished.  
 The  people in Cleator Moor are very  
 kind, friendly and generous, although 
 perhaps a rather tight-knit community.</content>
