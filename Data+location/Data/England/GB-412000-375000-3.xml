		<content>  Well Dressings are made to give      
 thanks for having water.A Well        
 Dressing has flowers arranged to make 
 a picture, usually a Biblical one.    
  A board like a frame is used. The    
 board may be as large as three metres 
 square. The board is a frame that the 
 clay is put into.The clay is puddled, 
 a process which softens and clears the
 clay of grit and stones. Next the     
 design is chosen,and the clay goes    
 into the frame.The design is pricked  
 onto the clay and certain plants and  
 flowers are collected; alder cones,   
 lichen,hydrangea,moon daisies,camomile
 flowers,pepper corns,geraniums and    
 marsh reeds,are some examples.These   
 are used to create the picture.A      
 Welldressing usually takes a week to  
 make and lasts for up to a week,      
 depending on the weather.
