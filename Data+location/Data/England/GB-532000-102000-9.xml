		<title>09PUBLIC HOUSING</title>
		<content> East Brighton has a substantial amount
 of public housing of varying age and  
 character. Lying within a valley of   
 its own overlooked by the racecourse, 
 the Whitehawk estate has grown into a 
 large almost separate community. Begun
 in the 1930's the early housing was   
 drab and unimaginative but much has   
 now been redeveloped to provide       
 interlocking terraced dwellings with  
 small gardens &amp; connecting paths which
 contribute to a much brighter and more
 pleasant environment. Closer to the   
 town centre areas of older terraced   
 housing have been completely removed  
 and replaced by a mixture of modern   
 high rise flats, two and three storey 
 maisonettes and terraced houses. In   
 conjunction with the tightly packed   
 older terraced dwellings of Kemp Town 
 they contribute to the very high local
 population densities.                 </content>
