		<title>03THE ARMY IN WARMINSTER</title>
		<content> Much of the town's prosperity depends 
 directly or indirectly on the Army.   
 The War Department was buying land on 
 Salisbury Plain for training before   
 1914 but the main military presence   
 came in 1937 when the School of       
 Infantry moved here from Hythe. The   
 School is now a major NATO training   
 base. Battlesbury Barracks was built  
 for troops who take part in exercises 
 on the Plain, at present the 1st      
 Battalion of the Worcestershire and   
 Sherwood Foresters Regiment (known as 
 the "Woofers"). Fighting vehicle      
 workshops were added in 1939, now 27  
 District REME. Since the 1939-45 War  
 the Ranges north and east of the      
 town have been closed to the public,  
 turning the village of Imber in the   
 middle of the Plain into a "ghost     
 town" only visited by soldiers, or    
 locals on the few open days.          </content>
