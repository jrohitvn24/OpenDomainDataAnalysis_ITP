		<title>13OUR VILLAGE BOBBY</title>
		<content> Has been a village policeman in       
 Brandon since 1961 when he came from  
 South Yorkshire. His favourite part of
 the village is where it is quiet and  
 he has an allotment. He has been      
 saddened by the pit closures, the     
 disappearance of the railway and has  
 seen many new housing estates grow up.
 When he is on duty he reports to      
 Meadowfield Police Station which is   
 linked to his main office in Durham.  
 Any reports that come in are given to 
 him and he investigates. He likes the 
 people of Brandon and is well known to
 nearly everybody.He likes to help     
 people and has had some frightening   
 moments with drunks. Usually nothing  
 out of the ordinary occurs in Brandon 
 but this year he has investigated an  
 abandoned baby and a murder on the old
 raiway line.                          
                                       </content>
