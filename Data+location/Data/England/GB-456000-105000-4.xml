		<content> The creek is tidal and it forms the   
 estuary of the river Wallington.Now   
 much silted up it was once,in the     
 earlier centuries a seaport in its own
 right.There are many ancient buildings
 still standing on the lower quay.The  
 mill is being turned into luxury      
 flats,and the naval hospital,at the   
 time of Napoleon now makes up the     
 office block for a local factory.     
       A marina is situated where once 
 large sailing ships came for repairs  
 and renovation.An annual regatta is   
 held and very well attended.Small     
 ships still use the quay mostly to    
 discharge dredged sand and shingle and
 in the last century it was a busy     
 coaling jetty.
