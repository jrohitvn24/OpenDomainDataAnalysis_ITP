		<content>Busy main Bayswater road leads to      
Marble Arch,on North East corner of    
Hyde park.The Arch originally for      
entrance to Buckingham palace was too  
narrow,so it was moved here            
where it serves as a center point      
for a vast amount of daily traffic,    
which goes around it clockwise.        
Opposite is Speakers Corner where      
{anyone}is entitled to address the     
public on any subject,mainly on        
Sundays.                               
There is still a Convent close by(a    
seclusion order)dedicated to the       
Tyburn Martyrs.Marble Arch stands      
where Tyburn did-a public hanging      
place in Georgian times.               
A road cuts through Hyde Park taking   
traffic from Langcaster gate to        
Kensington.The serpentine-a large man  
made lake-has a lido and rowing and    
sailing boats for hire.                </content>
