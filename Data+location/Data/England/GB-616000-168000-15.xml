		<title>15COMMUTERS DAY FROM HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> Commuting to London normally involves 
 catching a train at about 7.30 a.m.   
 and arriving back in Herne Bay at     
 about 7 p.m.. Usually the procedure   
 involves transport to and from Herne  
 Bay Station and also transport to work
 once in London. With the strikes and  
 mechanical failures which afflict the 
 railways, added to the physical and   
 mental tiredness of a long day this   
 can be very stressful. The greater job
 opportunities offered in London plus  
 the higher saleries are some          
 compensation. However in recent years 
 the cost of rail travel has risen     
 greatly so that the daily Herne Bay to
 London journey now costs over Â£1000   
 and now many commuters are more       
 prepared to look for a local job even 
 though this may entail a drop in      
 salery.
