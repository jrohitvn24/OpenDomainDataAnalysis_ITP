		<title>10WATER TOWER  HOUGHTON</title>
		<content> In 1984 the restoration of the water  
 tower gained top prize in the TRADES  
 of the YEAR, plastering and decorators
 section.The water tower was used to   
 store 16,OOO gallons of water for     
 domestic use at the hall until mains  
 water was introduced. It was built to 
 the design  of the ninth EARL of      
 PEMBROKE about 173O, in the PALLADIAN 
 style with brick and stone cased in   
 stucco.The project was carried out by 
 the DOWAGER MARCHIONESS with the aid  
 of a grant from the Department of the 
 Environment. The tower, standing in   
 the hall grounds, still contains      
 16,OOO gallons of water and may be    
 seen from the outside by the public on
 the open days.                        
 There is no mains sewage at Houghton  
 but it is dealt with privately.
