		<title>15Hellingly School.</title>
		<content> Hellingly School is'nt a very big     
 school.It has about seven classrooms  
 and a big field for infants and       
 juniors. They have recently built an  
 animal enclosure. They had two guinea 
 pigs, one rabbit, two ducks and a     
 small pond for the ducks.             
 The school hall was once three        
 separate classrooms and in one of the 
 classrooms there was a school bell    
 which they used to ring to tell people
 to come to school. The bell is still  
 there with a picture underneath       
 showing children ringing the bell.Some
 of the teachers sit in a small hut at 
 break.                                
 There are roughly 130 children in the 
 school, aged from 5 to 11. Hellingly  
 School is a nice school. The children 
 and teachers were very friendly, and  
 the children don't wear School        
 uniform.  by Julie Russell            </content>
