		<content>     We know from old records that the 
 staple diet consisted mainly of       
 oats. The Saxon name "Haverbrack"     
 tells us that they were grown locally.
 There were oak woods and hazel trees. 
 Some sheep grazed on the hillsides.   
 The local people had jobs in the      
 immediate vicinity. There was a       
 village pond and a small cluster of   
 houses by the church.                 
     At the present time the land is   
 used mainly for grazing and for       
 caravan parks. There are lots of      
 hazel, sycamore and evergreens. There 
 has been a limited increase in        
 housing.                              
     The paper mill employs some local 
 people but many commute to near by    
 towns. The area is a well known       
 tourist attraction.
