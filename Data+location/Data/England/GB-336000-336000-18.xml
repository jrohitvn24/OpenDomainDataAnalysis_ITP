		<content> It was all written up in the paper    
 Publicity might help you see,         
 The neighbours rallied round to help  
 And Elizabeth made tea.               
                                       
 And then it was discovered            
 That the owner of the sheep           
 Had moved to fresh pastures           
 And better winter keep.               
                                       
 The moral of the story                
 Is to check before you ring           
 Make sure you've got the facts all    
 right                                 
 Before you do a thing.                
                                       
 For policemen are too busy            
 To look for missing sheep             
 Since trailers are being stolen       
 Almost every week.
