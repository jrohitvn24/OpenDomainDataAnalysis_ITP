 My name is Jon Middleton, I am 15     
 years old and attend Sutherland High  
 school. There are four members in my  
 family, my mother, my father and my   
 younger sister.                       
 We live in a time of hign unemployment
 where standards are important and     
 school qualifications are essential   
 for success. We are governed by a     
 party who inject no hope into the     
 economy and the people, the outlook is
 depressing. We are surrounded by bad  
 news and disasters. People suffer and 
 yet still our government does nothing.
 My enjoyment includes watching        
 Manchester United, going roller       
 skating and going to discos. I cannot 
 moan about life in general, my parents
 have always provided the best for me. 
 My main ambition is to do well for    
 myself and survive in our harsh world.</content>
