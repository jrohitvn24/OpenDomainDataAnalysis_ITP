		<content> Odcombe Football Club is one of the   
 oldest clubs in the{Yeovil and        
{district fooball league}being started 
 as far back as 1920 or earlier. In    
 about 1973 Odcombe had 2 teams quite  
 high in the league but now there is   
 only 1. The team is picked from       
 about 18 players, 5 or 6 of them live 
 in the village and others have links  
 with the village. The clubs colours   
 are yellow and blue and the football  
 pitch  is next to the Village Hall    
 with changing rooms at the back of the
 hall itself. I sometimes go to watch  
 them play and so does my friend. We   
 both think it is very good. They have 
 a few injuries. We were there when    
 the brother of one of my friends got  
 kicked in the back.We wouldn't like to
 play because of the risk of injury.   
 They have big crowds watching them on 
 Sunday.                               </content>
