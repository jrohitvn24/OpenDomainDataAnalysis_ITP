		<content> Milk churns standing at the roadside  
 awaiting collection were once a common
 feature of the area, but during the   
 past few years, the churns have       
 vanished and the blue bulk tanker of  
 the Milk Marketing Board has taken    
 their place.                          
 Round bales and larger bales (of hay) 
 are becoming increasingly common, but 
 many more meadows are now cut for     
 silage, which is being stored in or   
 under black polythene.                
 The Council Highways depot at         
 Bainbridge, which has, over the years,
 done an excellent job keeping         
 difficult roads open and under repair,
 is about to be closed.                
 The increase in the numbers of        
 low-flying military aircraft is       
 causing much local concern, both      
 from the point of view of the danger  
 and the effect on tourism.            </content>
