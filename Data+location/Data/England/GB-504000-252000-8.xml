		<content>   The estate is served by the United  
 Counties 'Bus Company which has two   
 services (106 &amp; 107) which lead to the
 town centre and beyond. The services  
 run alternatively at 15 minute        
 intervals but the cost of frequent    
 travel by families is such that most  
 families have their own means of      
 transport.                            
   In the school survey, 92% of the    
 families owned at least one motor-car.
 10% of the families also owned a      
 caravan. 3% owned a boat.             
   Nearly every child old enough to    
 ride a bicycle had one. Many of the   
 children had the latest models with   
 many gears or else had a BMX type of  
 sports model.                         
   Road safety measures in the form of 
 crossing patrols, cycling proficiency 
 courses and other school projects are 
 much in evidence in Bedford.          </content>
