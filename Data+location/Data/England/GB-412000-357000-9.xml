		<content>    Many of the houses in Biggin were  
 built of{stone}in the last century    
    There are no high flats,but there  
 are many cottages and some bungalows. 
    A substantial proportion of the    
 housing in the village was built by   
 the{council}before and since the war. 
    The latest development is the      
 building of the old people's flats    
 which are made from limestone blocks  
 set in concrete with polystyrene      
 insulation between these and the      
 internal breeze block walls.          
   Some old cottages have been         
 modernized and a barn has been        
 converted to a house.                 
   Yew tree Farmhouse and two cottages 
 are listed buildings in the village.  
   There is no gas in Biggin but all   
 houses have mains water and sewage.   
 Many houses have a telephone and most 
 houses have inside toilets.           </content>
