 on part clay in the West &amp; on chalk or
 sand in the East. The woods &amp; copses  
 all consist mainly of{coppiced hazel. 
 Most of these have not been managed   
 for at least 30/40 yrs. at least, but 
 a few are still used for fencing &amp;    
 thatching spars. The woods are very   
 old and the land may well not have    
 been used for any other purpose _ as  
 shown by ,"indicator", plants such as 
 Garlic, Field Maple, Wood Spurge etc. 
 Some hedges are 600 to 800 yrs. old.  
{A current survey involving over 200   
{volunteers}over the period 1984 - 1990
 has already discovered 254 different  
 plants &amp; many more will certainly be  
 discovered. The Duke of Argyll's Tea  
 Plant-(probably escaped from a cottage
 garden), the Wild Service Tree &amp; rare 
 orchids are among those found so far. </content>
