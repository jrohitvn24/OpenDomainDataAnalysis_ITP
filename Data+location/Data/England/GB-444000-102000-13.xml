		<title>13Games Children Play</title>
		<content>     In the playground I play marbles, 
 football and baseball.                
     Marbles are little glass balls    
 with coloured patterns inside them.   
 They come in all different sizes from 
 very tiny ones called "Tiny Tims" to  
 very large ones called "King Sizes".  
 There are also other names for        
 special ones like Moonies and Oilies. 
 In marbles you can play hits or pots. 
 I play pots. In this you try winning  
 all the marbles in  the pot.The one{  
 to get the very last marble in wins.  
   At home I play on my computer.I have
 lots of different games.The Hobbit is 
 an adventure game which has got       
 written text.You are Bilbo Baggins.You
 meet people like Gandalf the magician 
 and Thorin the son of the King. The   
 idea of the game is to get to Smorg a 
 dragon and steal all his treasure.    
   I sometimes go for bicycle rides.   </content>
