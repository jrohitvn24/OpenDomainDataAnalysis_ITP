		<title>02FEN BLOW AT FELTWELL ANCHOR</title>
		<content>   Being extremely light, the peat soil
 of the Fens tends to blow away in     
 periods of dry weather. When this     
 happens visibility can be reduced to a
 few yards and drifts of peat dust     
 form in hollows and dykes,            
 sometimes impeding drainage.          
 This is most likely to happen in the  
 spring when the land has not yet      
 attained its full cover of crops.     
 Severe damage can occur to seedlings, 
 particularly of sugar beet, sometimes 
 necessitating reseeding.              
   Farmers take various steps to combat
 the problem. In some areas, though not
 at Feltwell Anchor, shelter hedges of 
 willow shield the fields. Another     
 method is to plant a quick growing    
 crop such as mustard to shield young  
 seedlings Later, selective weedkiller 
 kills the nurse plants. It is even    
 possible to plant rows of straw.      </content>
