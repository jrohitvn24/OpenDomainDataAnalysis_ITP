		<title>01GENERAL VIEWS OF WOODINGDEAN</title>
		<content>   Woodingdean is over the hill from   
   Brighton. From most places you can  
   see the sea, from others the Downs. 
   It is only noisy near the two main  
   roads: most of the area is quiet.   
      There are large cornfields which 
   lead to a park. There is a community
   centre, a swimming pool, three      
   schools, three churches, and parades
   of shops. There are two pubs, only  
   one of which you can stay in, as    
   Woodingdean is not really a holiday 
   place.                              
      The major land cover is Downland,
   including a Nature Reserve. There   
   are lots of tracks over the grass   
   some of which are old roadways.
