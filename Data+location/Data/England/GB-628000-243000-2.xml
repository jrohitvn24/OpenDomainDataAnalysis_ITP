		<title>02Waldringfield: Description</title>
		<content> Waldringfield appears to be a very{   
{seasonal}village.The life of the      
 village certainly revolves around the 
 river in{summer},when many boat owners
 and tourists venture onto the river   
 Deben,and sail from Woodbridge to     
 Felixstowe Ferry-stopping off en route
 at Waldringfield.                     
                                       
 The village has a{pub-the Maybush}    
 ,which can easily be seen from the    
 river,since it flies a{Tolly Cobbold} 
 (brewery) flag from its flagpole,and  
 has a large Maybush in its scenic     
 garden.There are two boatyards and    
{river trips}are run on{Jumna}.        
                                       
 The{local shop}stocks many items      
 useful to waterising                  
 holidaymakers-tins,ready              
 sauces,pasta,simply prepared food etc.
 -obviously with the tourist in mind.  </content>
