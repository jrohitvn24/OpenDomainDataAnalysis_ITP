		<title>12SUDELEY CASTLE - HISTORY Pt2</title>
		<content> The castle again rose into prominence 
 in the 15th and 16th Century. After   
 her secret marriage to Thomas Seymour,
 Katherine Parr,(Henry VII's widow)    
 came to Sudeley with  large household.
 Five days after giving birth to       
 Seymour's daughter, she died, and was 
 buried in the Chapel at Sudeley. Soon 
 afterwards, the castle passed into the
 hands of the Brydges family,Thomas    
 being created Lord Chandos of Sudeley.
 Following the death of Elizabeth I and
 the Civil War, Sudeley Castle was     
 predominantly Royalist, though held as
 a Parliamentary garrison for a time.  
 Much of the Castle was demolished when
 the Parliamentarians were victorious. 
 From the time of the Civil Wars, until
 1837 when bought by the Dent Family,  
 Sudeley remained forgotten. The Dent  
 Family instigated cosiderable         
 restoration work.                 (7) </content>
