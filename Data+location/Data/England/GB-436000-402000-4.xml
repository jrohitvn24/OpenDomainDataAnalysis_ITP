		<content> DOVECLIFFE AND WOMBWELL WOODS TAKE UP 
 OVER A SQUARE KILOMETRE AND AS WE     
 PASSED THROUGH WE SAW THAT THEY       
 CONSISTED MAINLY OF SYCAMORE AND      
 SILVER BIRCH, BUT OAK, ASH AND WILLOW 
 WERE ALSO THERE. THE TALLEST WERE     
 ABOUT 14 METRES BUT MANY WERE SPINDLY 
 THROUGH GROWING TOO CLOSE. THERE IS A 
 5 ACRE WOOD ON SWAITHE HALL FARM WHERE
 AGAIN SYCAMORE WERE PREDOMINANT       
 AMONGST OAK, ASH, WILLOW, WHITEBEAM   
 AND CHESTNUT. SYCAMORE OF 2O METRES   
 WERE THE TALLEST AND ONE OR TWO HAD   
 TRUNK GIRTHS OF 4 METRES. THE TREES   
 HAD BEEN THINNED OUT IN THE PAST AND  
 IT WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE AND UNSPOILED
 PLACE. WE ALSO SAW SOME TREES WHICH   
 HAD BEEN PLANTED ON A RECLAIMED PIT   
 SPOIL HEAP IN WOMBWELL AND FROM A     
 DISTANCE THEY LOOKED TO BE DOING WELL.
