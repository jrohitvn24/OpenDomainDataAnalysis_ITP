 The railway line through Cudworth was 
 part of the{Midland Railway's}Scottish
 route. At one time the{station}was the
 only one for Barnsley and had 7       
 platforms and many sidings holding    
 hundreds of{coal}wagons.              
                                       
 Today the station is in ruins but the 
 signal box and some of the{buildings  
 remain; the platforms have gone. We   
 saw that the bricks were laid in the  
 Flemish Bond pattern.                 
                                       
 Everything is covered in weeds and few
 trains pass on the line; the only ones
 we see regularly are those that take  
 sand every morning to Redfearn's      
 glassworks.
