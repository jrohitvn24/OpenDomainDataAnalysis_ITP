		<content> On Holcombe Hill is a well-kwown      
 landmark called{Peel Tower}or         
 Monument.It was named after{Robert   }
{Peel}because of his work in repealing 
 the Corn Laws in 1846; he also was the
 founder of the Police Force in this   
 country, as well as being Prime       
 Minister.                             
 From the top of the tower, which is   
 335m. above sea-level, it is possible 
 on a clear day to see the hills of    
 Wales and sometimes the Isle of       
 Man.The entrance to the tower has been
 closed due to it being unsafe. Local  
 residents have compaigned for its     
 re-opening and money has now become   
 available and{restoration work}should 
 be complete by August this            
 year-1985.It is a{local custom}for    
 people to walk to Peel Tower on{Good }
