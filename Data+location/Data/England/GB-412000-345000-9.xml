		<content>Although in our area there are not many
facilities for organised leisure       
activities there are plenty of         
interesting and lovely walks. Many     
families ramble in Dydon Woods, Okeover
Park,Cuckoo Cliff and Foxholes near    
Hanging Bridge is popular.             
The three pubs have a varity of games  
available,darts,snooker,dominoes and   
electronic games. One of the pubs,The  
Royal Oak, has a big Pop Quiz and the  
proceeds go to a good cause. This year 
two local schools were given almost    
four hundred pounds each. The Henry    
Prince First School Mayfield was one of
these and a video machine was bought.  
Tug-of-War is a popular leisure        
activity. There is a successful team in
our area called "Hanging Bridge". They 
train near The Royal Oak.              
There is a Pony Trekking Centre at     
Throstle's Nest Farm which is popular. </content>
