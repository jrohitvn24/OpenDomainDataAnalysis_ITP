  Our area contains the valley of the  
River Rattlesden,locally called the    
River Rat,which is used as a Parish    
boundary.                              
  The map shows osier beds beside the  
river.These are willow trees which were
cut for making baskets.This no longer  
happens.                               
  The average depth of the river is    
three feet.The ford on Wash Lane       
is usually quite shallow but after much
rain it is unsuitable for vehicles.It  
is thought that originally the name of 
the lane was because of women coming to
the river to wash clothes.             
  At both ends of Wash Lane there are a
few cottages.Some of the cottages were 
built in the late 1800's.
