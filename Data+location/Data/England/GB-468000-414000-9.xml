		<content>  Sometimes the children used to go to 
 the cinema in Moorends or THorne.     
 Their parents might go to the         
 'sixpenny hop' which was a dance held 
 on a Friday night.                    
   Although they did not have          
 television, they did have gramaphones.
 They also had radios and some were the
 type that had earphones. They listened
 to programmes like the Ovaltinies, The
 Goon Show and Journey Into Space.     
   When the children played in the     
 street they played games like these:  
 Skipping, firing cardboard milk-bottle
 tops onto the wall and marbles. They  
 also played hopscotch, tracking and   
 lamp-post swinging.                   
   On Sunday nights the whole family   
 would take part in a get-together     
 singsong. They had no Bingo.          
   It was hard on the younger children 
 because they never got new clothes.   </content>
