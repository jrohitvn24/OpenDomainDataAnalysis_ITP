		<content> There is a large church in Thurlstone 
 and a non-conformist Chapel. All these
 buildings are constructed of distinc- 
 tive local sandstone which has        
 weathered a sombre grey hue. Building 
 stone used to be quarried locally.    
 There is a large disused quarry above 
 Thurlstone, which has reverted to its 
 wild state.                           
                                       
 There are three small modern develop- 
 ments in Millhouse - Copperas Close,  
 the Birks Estate and a small council  
 estate. Thurlstone also has a small   
 area of council housing and 2 small   
 modern developments. Post-war housing 
 is of brick. There are a few small    
 locally owned shops; 2 in Millhouse   
 and some along the main road in       
 Thurlstone.
