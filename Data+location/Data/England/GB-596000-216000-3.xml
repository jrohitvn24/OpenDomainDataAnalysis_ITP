 We went to visit {Pete Tye Farm.      
 When we got there we met Mr Coan the  
 farmer.  First we went to see the     
 sows.  On the way to the sty we met   
 Pat, he is in charge of the pigs stys.
 Mr Coan has two horses one called Bell
 and the other one is called Holly.    
 We gave the horses grass. Mr Coan had 
 a bird scarer that was run on gas,    
 it went Bang!.  The farm does not sell
 their manure, they put it in their    
 crops.  We saw some sows, some piglets
 and some boars, there were about 50   
 boars, over a 100 sows and over 1000  
 piglets.  Mr Coan had a field of oil  
 seed rape, wheat and peas. The pigeons
 were racing Blues.
