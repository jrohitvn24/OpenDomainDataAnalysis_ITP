		<title>03THE ASKAM IRONWORKS</title>
		<content>     The Iron Works started in the late
 19th Century. After serving a useful  
 life it became defunct shortly after  
 the First World War. Its closedown    
 left a derelict area of some 50 acres.
 It looked appalling within the village
 of Askam itself and observed from a   
 distance spoilt the otherwise         
 attractive view of the Furness        
 Penisula and the Lake District Fells. 
 This area has now been cleared and    
 leaves scope for further development  
 of small industries or sporting or    
 leisure activities. The site however  
 is in private ownership and to date no
 firm proposals of any kind have been  
 produced. There is access for the     
 public and parts of the site are      
 utilised for walks and approaches to  
 the shore and surrounding countryside.
