		<title>02 CONSTANTINE LANDSCAPE 1</title>
		<content> Constantine is about 100 metres       
 above sea level.On either side of     
 Constantine it has wooded valleys with
 streams leading to the Helford river. 
 Valleys are covered with decidous     
 trees .The village has views over the 
 Lizard peninsula towards the sea.Much 
 of the surrounding area is productive 
 farm land growing vegetable crops.We  
 can also see herds of milking cows in 
 fields.Generally the area has so      
 features  than the North coast of     
 Cornwall.There are many sheltered     
 coves along the coastline of the      
 Lizard area.The nearest beach to      
 Constantine for swimming is Gunwalloe 
 on the Lizard.Because we are near     
 Culdrose R.N. airfield we a           
 constantly overflown by helicopters.  
 Constantine lies on granite strata but
 we have a fault line running under the
 Helford River valley.                 </content>
