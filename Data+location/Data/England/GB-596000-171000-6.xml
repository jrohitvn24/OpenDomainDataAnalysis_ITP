		<title>06Caravan Sites Eastchurch</title>
		<content>   In recent years there has been a    
 change in the use of land close to    
 the sea in the Eastchurch area from   
{farming},to caravan and chalet sites. 
 For many years Londoners have visited 
 these sites during the summer months. 
   The opening of the Olau Line        
 passenger service from Sheerness to   
 Flushing has led to an increase in the
 number of foreign{tourists.}          
   Most of the{caravans}are owner      
 occupied although a number can be     
 hired for between Â£50 and Â£60 per     
 week.                                 
   On the more developed sites shops,  
{entertainments}and sporting facilities
 are available. Amenities are          
 frequently being improved because of  
 the competition between the sites.
