		<content> As can be seen from the count, the    
 area has very few amenities.The       
 village of Arlecdon is in fact quite  
 well served but the amenities are not 
 evident in the count as they are all  
 present in the part of the village    
 which is included in the next "block" 
 to the south.                         
 The remaining services and amenities  
 can easily be summarised here as being
 a sewage works,a church,two public    
 houses and a limited bus service.     
 The church (St.Michael's) is situated 
 between the village of Arlecdon and   
 Asby and is somewhat out on a limb.It 
 is an old building and the lack of    
 conregation is not helped by the fact 
 that it is fairly remote.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
