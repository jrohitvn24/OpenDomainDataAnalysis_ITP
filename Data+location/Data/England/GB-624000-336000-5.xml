		<title>05ECOLOGY IN SOUTHREPPS</title>
		<content> From loop road at Southrepps one sees,
 across fields the woods and coast at  
 Trimingham. East is Gimingham, west   
 Thorpe. Fields have been enlarged by  
 dismantling hedges and banks, dykes   
 filled in, thus wild life has         
 suffered. With potatoe crops foliage  
 is sprayed to inhibit growth, other   
 crops also sprayed with chemicals.    
 Small local roads are little more     
 than gritty lanes,and there are wild  
 flowers on the banks.  During this    
 cool summer bees and butterflies have 
 been less evident. Public footpaths   
 are registered. There are new houses  
 but older buildings, mostly of flint  
 and brick may be over 200 years old.  
 Most seem well maintained, and have   
 gardens.                              
 Recently a few trees have been planted
 but the general impression is one of  
 intensive agriculture.                </content>
