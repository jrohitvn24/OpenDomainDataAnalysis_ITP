		<content> The soil of this area is a sandstone -
 clay mixture,it was once covered with 
 deciduous woods but most were cleared 
 in the past for farmland.Landowners   
 are now clearing even more decidous   
 trees and planting conifers,which has 
 quite a marked effect,as coniferous   
 woodland does not support as wide a   
 variety of plant life.There is,however
 a great deal that is of interest in   
 the hedgerows and woods.As well as the
 more common wild flowers, including,  
 dandilion, buttercup, daisy,herb      
 robert,plantain and clover, there are 
 several rare plants,Ladies Tresses,   
 Centaury,Yellow wort,Green winged     
 Orchids (Orchis Moria) Butterfly      
 Ochids (Platanthera) and,in a spot    
 known to naturalists and protected by 
 a barbed wire barrier, the last group 
 of Marsh Helliborine (Epipactis       
 Palustris) in the county.             </content>
