		<title>08The Tower Repairs.</title>
		<content> In 1887 St. Peter's Church tower      
was found to be leaning some 30 inches 
towards the south east, because of the 
danger the tower had to be rebuilt.    
It was carefully taken down, stone by  
stone, each one being marked so that   
it could be replaced exactly.  The     
reconstruction took over five years.   
There are eight bells in the tower     
which chime every quarter hour.  The   
tower can still be climbed by the      
narrow spiral stone staircase.  When   
you go up the tower you can see for    
miles, you can see six church spires   
which are: Ringstead, Stanwick, Higham 
Ferrers, Irchester, Rushden and        
Raunds.  On the top of the tower there 
is a weather-vane.  Sometimes there is 
a fete at the church when it is        
possible to climb the tower.  It is a  
good vantage point for taking views of 
the surrounding countryside.           </content>
