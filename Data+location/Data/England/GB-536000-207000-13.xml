  Close to Dobbs Weir and Lea Valley   
 Park is{Nether Hall}ruins. The        
 restored and maintained farmhouse is a
 grade 2 listed building. Part is      
 medieval and the rest 14th. century.  
 The owners breed and race greyhounds  
 and the old cattle sheds house 27     
 dogs. Around the beautiful farmhouse  
 exercise pens have been built. Close  
 by is a 13th. century barn. The owners
 in conjunction with Epping Forest     
 Council and Lea Valley Regional Park  
 Authority hope to restore and make the
 barn open to the public. In the farm's
 grounds lies Nether Hall ruin. This   
 15th. century building has been partly
 destroyed. Its brick lined moat still 
 exists and is home to many water birds
 including moorhens, coots and         
 kingfishers.
