		<content>    It is necessary for some of the    
 farms to use{mechanical irrigation},  
 notably Gallow Hill Farm, Westgate and
 Chalk Farm. Sussex Farm has a         
 water bore. There are wells on Gallow 
 Hill Farm, Sussex Farm, Chalk Farm and
 Cradle Hall Farm. Sunnymead Farm and  
 Sussex Farm have natural springs.     
    Modern barns are now taking over   
 from the traditional{Norfolk barns};  
 these still remain though none has a  
 preservation order on it. Sussex      
 Farm has 23 farmworkers' cottages,    
 though these are not all used for     
 farmworkers. Muckleton has four and   
 Crabbe Hall has one.                  
    There are{shooting rights}on all   
 the farms and these are all used,     
 except at Crabbe Hall. Pheasants      
 and partridges are reared for         
 shooting at Sussex Farm and at Friar's
 Thorne Farm.                          </content>
