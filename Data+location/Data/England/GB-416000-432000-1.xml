		<title>01THE ORIGINS OF BRADFORD</title>
		<content>  At the time of the original  Domesday
 it was said that{"Ilbert de Lacy  hath
{it; it is waste."  }In  1379  after  a
 plague the population was only 300.   
  It was not until about 1760, with the
{Industrial Revolution,}that  the  town
 began to grow. Trade developed,a canal
 and roads were built, &amp;  coal and iron
 works were developed.  In  1842 it was
 described as{"the  filthiest and worst
{regulated town in the Kingdom."       
  In 1847 Bradford was Incorporated and
 the Council went on to  'clean up' the
 squallour - a  task  which  they  have
 continued to the present day.   It now
 has  a  modern  city  centre    around
 the splendid historic City Hall.      
   Now a{Metropolitan District,} with a
 growing  population of  454,198 (1981)
 it is still known as the{"wool capital
{of the World."}
