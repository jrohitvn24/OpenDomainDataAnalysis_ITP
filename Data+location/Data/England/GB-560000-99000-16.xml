		<title>16The Redoubt.</title>
		<content> The {Redoubt Fortress} is one of a    
 line of {coastal defences} built      
 because of the threat of invasion by{ 
{Napoleon} in the {early nineteenth    
{century.}                             
 It is a large circular fortress       
 surrounded by a moat. In the centre is
 an open space which is used for {     
{display} and {concerts} during the    
 summer months.                        
 In recent years the fortress has been{
{restored} to its original state. At   
 one time the centre housed a model    
 village. It is possible to walk round 
 the upper part and see some of the {  
{restored cannons} and their           
 emplacements. Underneath in the old   
 garrison part is a rapidly expanding  
{museum}showing items from Napoleonic  
 times to the present day. Another part
 consists of an {Aquarium} and a cafe.
