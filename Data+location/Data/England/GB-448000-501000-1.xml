		<title>01Review of the block, Faceby</title>
		<content> This covers most of{Whorlton,}all of  
{Faceby}parish and parts of{Potto,}    
{Carlton}and{Swainby.}Except for part  
 of the NW corner, it is in the{North} 
{York Moors National Park,}and is flat 
 agricultural land rising from 260 ft  
 to an exposed N-facing escarpment 1338
 ft high. There are no shops, markets, 
 businesses, schools, almost no        
 industries except agriculture, and no 
 major roads. Faceby, a commuter       
 village 14 miles from Teesside,       
 has many residents working there in   
 industry, the professions and         
 commerce. Whorlton, divided from      
 Faceby by Whorl Hill, a natural       
 landmark, has a ruined Norman castle  
 and church, and few houses. Swainby   
 includes only the area round Mill     
 Farm, with part of the now disused    
 railway laid in 1857 to carry calcined
 ironstone from Scugdale mines.        </content>
