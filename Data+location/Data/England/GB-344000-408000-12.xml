		<title>12Ormskirk Golf Club</title>
		<content>Ormskirk Golf Club was established in  
1890. Originally part of the Lathom    
estate it was sold in 1920.Standing on 
Cranes Lanes,the clubhouse caters for a
membership of 300 men and 150 'lady    
subscribers'as they are called.The club
is run by 4 trustees,who hold that     
position until their death.            
Although the 1980's has seen increased 
leisure this does not affect the Golf  
Club since their numbers are strictly  
regulated and there is a long waiting  
list to join.                          
Ormskirk has or have had members who   
have achieved notoriety in the sport.  
Dr.David Marsh Captained his country as
an amateur player,and David Eccleston, 
still a member,was runner up to Nick   
Faldo in a tournament.                 
One member,MrG.H.Riding,of 45 Bridge   
Street,Ormskirk got a Hole-in-One using
a 7iron at the 135yds 14th hole in July</content>
