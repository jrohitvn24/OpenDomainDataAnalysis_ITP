		<content> The Old School - Mary Deans           
 This school was opened in 1877 after  
 the village outgrew the first school, 
 called Hillside, when schooling became
 compulsory.  The old Mary Deans school
 is in three sections - the main       
 section(above which the bell was); a  
 middle section and the section beside 
 the Headmaster's house, which was next
 door.  This school building was again 
 outgrown in 1976, and Mary Deans      
 school moved into a new building near 
 the Naval Estate in Tamerton Foliot.  
 The old buildings were converted for  
 residential use.                      
 The New School - Tamerton Vale        
 This school was opened in 1971 by our 
 present Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.
 The school has three playgrounds      
 surrounded by grass,two playing fields
 and a small swimming pool.
