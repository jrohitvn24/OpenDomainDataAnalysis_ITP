		<title>17Schools in the Binstead area</title>
		<content>   There is one{primary school}in the  
 village of{Binstead.}It is a modern   
 building in an elevated position at   
 the top of{Hazelmere Avenue.}It was   
{built in 1971}and was opened on the   
 27th April of that year.              
   The old, original school, built in  
 1864 still stands but is now 3        
 maisonettes. The exterior stone walls 
 made from stone from the local        
{"Pitts"}are still as they were when   
 the building was a school.            
   The only other school in the area   
 was{Havenstreet School.}It was{closed 
{down in July 1970}and the building, on
 the main street of the village, is now
 used as a community centre.           
  {Binstead School}still maintains the 
 old tradition of the{maypole}at       
 Midsummer. There is a procession of   
 the{May Queen}and each class performs 
 a dance- traditional or contemporary. </content>
