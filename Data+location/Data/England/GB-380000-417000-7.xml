		<content> Many of the abandoned farm houses have
 been bought up and converted into     
 luxury homes for those who can afford 
 them.Main farm houses and barns have  
 been knocked through and internally   
 modernised, but keeping their older   
 looking exterior.                     
   Lodge Lane in Turn Village,contains 
{Lodge Mill}and cottages beyond.These  
 originally housed the mill workers but
 are now owned privately by commutors .
   Lime Leach house was obviously an   
 18th century loomshop and the takin'in
 steps to the eastern gable still      
 remain.Today it consists of three     
 privately owned cottages, two of which
 are presently occupied.
