		<content> The Holton-le-Moor W.I.was formed in  
 1918.At the moment it has 21 members  
 and meets once a month at the Moot    
 Hall.It tries to cater for the very   
 diverse interests of its members.Itis 
 run by a committee and is affiliated  
 to the national Federation of Womens  
 Institute which is a countrywide      
 organisation catering for the         
 interests of women.Holton W.I.has come
 through the doldrums after a boom     
 during the second World War.Recently  
 we have been able to welcome some of  
 the newcomersa to the village into the
 group aaand they have proved valuable 
 assets.As the role of women in the    
 community changes so does the W.I.and 
 hopefully it will continue for thew   
 next 67 years.
