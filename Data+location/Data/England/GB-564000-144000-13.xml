		<title>13Shopping Centre,Paddock Wood</title>
		<content>The shopping centre in Paddock Wood is 
situated along Commercial Road which   
leads to the railway station.It has a  
wide variety of shops and serves the   
local community well.It also caters for
the people in outlying villages. There 
are two main car parks and a station   
car park for shoppers to use,but       
Commercial Road can be very busy and   
congested at certain times of the day. 
Most elderly people of Paddock Wood are
very pleased with the shopping centre  
as they are able to buy most of the    
things they require. The shops are     
within walking distance ofn Macdonald  
Court and Dowding House,then two main  
homes for the elderly.However most     
Saturday shopping is done in Maidstone,
Tonbridge or Tunbridge Wells.
