 I HAVE FIVE DOGS, TWO HOUSE DOGS, TWO 
 FARM DOGS AND ONE GUN DOG.  BEN AND   
 MAUD ARE HOUSE DOGS, SAM AND JEM ARE  
 FARM DOGS AND CHLOE IS A GUN DOG.  I  
 HAVE TWO GUINEA PIGS, ONE IS CALLED   
 BOGGY AND THE OTHER IS CALLED BABY.  I
 HAVE THREE CATS AND TWO KITTENS, THE  
 KITTENS ARE CALLED SOPPY AND POLO AND 
 THE THREE CATS ARE CALLED MINTY,      
 RAA-RAA AND ROUTE.  ROUTE IS A TOM CAT
 AND MINTY IS THE MOTHER OF THE        
 KITTENS. AFTER I HAVE FED SAM AND JEM,
 I FEED MINTY AND RAA-RAA.  I GIVE THEM
 DOG FOOD AND I PUT SOME MILK DOWN ON  
 THE FLOOR. I LOVE MY PETS AND PLAY    
 WITH THEM A LOT.
