		<content> The area is composed of woodland and  
 farmland, spread over high ground with
 deep valleys.  Streams run allong the 
 bottoms.  the sides are too steep for 
 farming.  Farmland is mainly pasture  
 with some arable.  The village of     
 Ardingly is on high ground, open on   
 all sides.  The older part is half a  
 mile to the west of the main          
 settlement around the Parish Church.  
 Older buildings are of local          
 sandstone, newer ones of brick.  The  
 2000 inhabitants are mainly commuters 
 working in business management, or    
 domestic or maintenance staff at      
 nearby Ardingly cottage.  There are a 
 small number of agricultural workers  
 and shop staff in local services.  The
 village is deminated by the reservoir 
 to the west and by the south of       
 England showground to the North.
