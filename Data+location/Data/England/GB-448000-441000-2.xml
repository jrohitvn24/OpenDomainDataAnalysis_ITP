		<title>02A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I didn't feel like getting up but I   
 knew I had to because it was school.I 
 could hear Jonathan my eldest brother 
 getting dressed and going downstairs  
 for his breakfast. Eventually I       
 persuaded myself to get up.I got my   
 school uniform out of my wardrobe and 
 put it on .Daniel came downstairs just
 after me so I got his breakfast.Then I
 went to brush teeth.I heard the front 
 door shut so I knew Jonathan had gone 
 to catch his bus.By now my Mum, Dad   
 and Matthew my youngest brother were  
 ready so we clambered into the car    
  and set off.First of all we dropped  
 my mum off and took Matthew to his    
 babysitter.At 9:00am the bell went    
 and we all went into school.The day   
 passed quickly and it was soon 3.30p.m
 and time for us to go home and have   
 tea.
