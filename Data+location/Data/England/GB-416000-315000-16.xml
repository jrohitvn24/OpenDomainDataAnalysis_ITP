Two belong to the Church of England and
one is a Methodist chapel.  The vicar  
of All Saints, Alrewas is also vicar of
Wychnor and Fradley.There are 2 morning
services on a Sunday with an average   
120 people attending.Afternoon and     
evening services are held at Wychnor   
or Fradley.The vicar is always busy    
preparing and taking services,teaching 
in the local school,hospital visiting, 
interviewing people or attending       
meetings.At present the church is in   
need of restoration costing 50,000     
pounds because the sandstone is        
wearing away.St. Leonards dates from   
the 13th century although parts may be 
earlier.  It has a very small          
congregation.It is  surrounded by      
farming land and looks out over the    
A38.Alrewas Methodist Chapel is a      
19thC. brick building.                 </content>
