		<content>{Chelford cattle market.               
 When we went to Chelford market we    
 interviewed some people.One person had
 come from as far as Sheffield,45 miles
 away.Some had come from Manchester and
 St.Helens. Most people we asked came  
 only on Mondays but a few came also on
 Wednesdays.A dairy cow costs Â£500,a   
 fat pig Â£60 and a sheep Â£20(for more  
 prices see page 6).Not many people    
 came from Chelford, nearly all coming 
 more than 4 miles. Most people were   
 selling but a few were buying.On      
 Mondays they bring live stock for     
 auction.On Wednesdays they bring hay  
 and straw and on Thursday nights they 
 sell plants. There are also stalls    
 selling boots and water-proof         
 clothing. Every month there are       
 two machinary sales selling tractors  
 and farm implements.The market is just
 North of the railway station.         </content>
