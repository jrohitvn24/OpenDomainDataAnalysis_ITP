		<title>03THE LEISURE CENTRE</title>
		<content>   The building was built in 1971.  21 
 people work there and all enjoy it.   
    In the sports hall there are many  
 activities, eg. unihock (indoor       
 hockey),circuit training, badminton,  
 karate and pop mobility (keep-fit). In
 the Victoria Hall (the old part of the
 leisure centre) different activities  
 are held, weddings,theatre productions
 exhibitions,fashion shows, dog shows. 
    Each week an average of 1500 people
 go to the leisure centre.  Some go    
 once a week, some alternate days, some
 every day.  The user age group varies 
 from 8-70+.                           
    Improvements have been made with   
 squash courts added.  Ideas for the   
 future include: better showering      
 facilities, more viewing areas, a     
 creche for babies, facilities for the 
 disabled, and possibly a swimming     
 pool.                                 </content>
