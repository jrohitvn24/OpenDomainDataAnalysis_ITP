		<title>07Farm visit - "Orrest Head"</title>
		<content> This 500 acre farm is situated just to
 the east of Windermere and dates from 
 the mid-17th century. On the farm     
 there are 50 dairy cows, 20 beef cows,
 20 beef calves, 30 milk heffers, 400  
 sheep, 4 sheep dogs, 1 terrier, 3     
 goats and 20 hens. They only sell     
 their cows if they are old, lame or   
 sick. They keep sheep for meat and    
 only take wool off the older sheep.   
 From the sheep they usually get 650   
 lambs - 325 will be breeding females  
 and the rest will be sold for meat.   
 They take their beef calves to Kendal 
 market at 16 months old.              
 In the spring of a typical year for   
 the farmer, Mr. Willison, lambing     
 takes place. Summer is hay making time
 and in the autumn he weans the lambs  
 and sells them. In winter he repairs  
 dry-stone walls, fences, drains and   
 hedges.                               </content>
