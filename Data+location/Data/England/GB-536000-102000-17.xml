 The village of Rottingdean is a       
 popular attrction for summer visitors 
 in particular. The five miles fro     
 Brighton is well served by open-topped
 buses terminating at the White Horse  
 Hotel as did the horsedrawn buses     
 earlier in the century. The           
 attractions include the village green 
 and pond; the Norman church of St.    
 Margarets, whose tower still bears the
 scars of the burning of the villagers 
 by French pirates in the fourteenth   
 century; the picturesque architecture,
 including the homes of Enid Bagnold   
 and Rudyard Kipling. Open air swimming
 pools and recreational facilities and 
 the beach and downland complete       
  scene.                               </content>
