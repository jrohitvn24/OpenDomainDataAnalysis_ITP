		<title>04THE VILLAGE OF HUMBERSTON.</title>
		<content>{ Humberston is a large village on the 
 East coast, very close to the urban   
 area of Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes.
 Although Humberston is nowadays rather
 a suburban area, there is still a     
 village atmosphere. People are very   
 keen to preserve this atmosphere and  
 there is enthusiastic support for all 
 local events and activities.          
 Facilities in the village are varied:-
 many good shops,primary and secondary 
 schools,churches,a post office,a      
 library,pubs,garages,and various      
 groups of all ages using the local    
 halls. There are few opportunities    
 for employment within the village.    
 There is an area near the coast       
 developed for tourism,and a small     
 commercial estate. Both areas offer   
 employment but most people travel into
 Grimsby or Cleethorpes or further     
 afield for employment.                </content>
