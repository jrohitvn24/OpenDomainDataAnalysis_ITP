 Dated  July 1985                      
 " It was a great pleasure for me to   
 present to the Bishop nineteen young  
 adults for Confirmation last month. It
 was good to see them so full of health
 and vitality, putting them selves on  
 the side of God and good and          
 committing themselves to fight against
 evil."                                
                                       
 "The floor in Bodenham church has been
 badly affected by woodworm. The P.C.C.
 has decided to have the floor treated,
 sanded, and sealed. During this work  
 the church will be closed, from Monday
 22nd of July to Wednesday 14th August.
 Services will be held as usual in our 
 other churches and I hope the Bodenham
 congregation will attend them."       
 "Bodenham Fete: Saturday 13th July, at
 2.30 p.m. at Siward James Close."     </content>
