		<title>13WINDY NOOK: NATURE PARK</title>
		<content> The nature park project is a          
 partnership between Gateshead         
 Metropolitan Borough Council and the  
 Conservation Volunteers. It began in  
 August 1981. The project is to make   
 the land suitable for different       
 species of plant and wild life which  
 would not normally be seen in an urban
 area. It is a good idea because the   
 land used to be{derelict}and quite    
 untidy. Also it means that local      
 schools can help to plant trees and   
 look after the pond. Many children in 
 the Felling and Gateshead area can say
 they have planted at least one tree in
 the park. The Nature Park covers about
 2 hectares, and is on land which used 
 to have houses built on it. Many of   
 the people who lived on this site     
 would have worked in the quarry or pit
 which were only a short distance away.
