       In the Lincolnsire Domesday     
 survey of 1086 the village was called 
 Claipol which perhaps means the form  
 of settlement on clay.                
       Claypole, as it is spelled      
 today, is the largest of our three    
 villages and in the census of 1981 had
 a population of 604 and had 215       
 households. There have been no great  
 changes since then.                   
       The main street runs from the   
 river bridge to the railway level     
 crossing, a distance of about one mile
 or 1.6 kilometres. There are five     
 short by-lanes.                       
       The houses are generally of the 
 red brick and pantile type, a         
 characteristic that is being          
 maintained in new building.
