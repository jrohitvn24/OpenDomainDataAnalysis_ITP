		<title>15The Oldest Pub in Sefton</title>
		<content> Before local reorganisation in 1974   
 the Scotch Piper was known as the     
 oldest pub in Lancashire.It was built 
 in 1320 and is nowadays a fine        
 biulding with a thatched roof.This    
 attractive feature has also proved to 
 be a problem.This year a fire         
 destroyed the roof,it is believed that
 a chimney defect led to some of the   
 roof timbers and thatch igniting.The  
 pub has had its past disasters,22     
 years ago another fire destroyed the  
 roof,it has suffered 3 floods and the 
 the roof has blown off in a gale.     
 This summer Charles Rigby and his wife
 Ada opened their doors again to the   
 public.
