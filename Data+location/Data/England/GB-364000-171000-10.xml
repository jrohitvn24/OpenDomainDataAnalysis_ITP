		<title>10Shoemaking in Kingswood.</title>
		<content>{Shoemaking}is a traditional {industry}
 associated with Kingswood. Some       
 families have provided generations of 
 workers, and they originally settled  
 here in order to be near the factory. 
 It takes four years to train as a {   
{clicker}to cut the shape of the shoe  
 out of leather. Twenty-four years ago 
 there were 107 clickers at the shoe   
 factory producing one hundred thousand
 pairs of shoes each week. The shoe    
 industry has declined for now there   
 are only eight clickers and thirty    
 five thousand pairs of shoes are      
 produced each week, mainly by machine.
 G.B.Brittons now produce a range of   
 footwear including men's casual shoes 
 and steel toe capped working boots.   
 The factory has a{social club}for the 
 use of employees, and their families  
 can make use of the sports facilities.
