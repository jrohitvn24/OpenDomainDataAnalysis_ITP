		<title>13The Blacksmith            RS</title>
		<content>  The blacksmith is{Stan Tweddall}whose
 assistants are his{two sons,}Ian and  
 Bryan Tweddall. The{blacksmith shop}is
 opposite Stan's house which is in the 
 middle of{Eppleby.}The{fire}they use  
 for making the horse shoes is a coke  
 fire blown by an electric motor.      
 Stan's father moved into the old forge
 in 1937 and the{new forge}was built   
 in 1973. The family has been          
 blacksmiths for{four generations.     
  The{work}the Tweddalls do is         
 horse-shoeing, agricultural repairs,  
 forge work and they make wrought iron 
 gates. Some horse shoeing and         
 agricultural repairs can be done on   
 farms. The job has changed because at 
 first they shoed cart horses but after
 the war they did mainly machinery     
 repairs. Now they shoe riding horses.
