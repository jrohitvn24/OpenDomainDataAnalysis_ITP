		<content>{ The Friends of Netherthorpe}started  
 about 1975 and organises things for   
 the school.  It is run by parents and 
 teachers.  All proceeds go to the     
 school.  They raise about Â£2000 per   
 year.  Their first idea was to try to 
 keep the school as a Grammar School   
 but it is now a Comprehensive.  Any   
 people who are connected with the     
 school can join.                      
  As well as{Scouts and Guides}there is
 a{B M X Club called Staveley Sliders. 
 There are{sports and athletics clubs. 
  The{debating society}gives pupils at 
 Netherthorpe a chance to give their   
 views on certain things.              
  In Woodthorpe there is a{keep fit    
 club,{Church club}and a{Choral club.
