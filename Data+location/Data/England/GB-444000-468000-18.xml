		<title>18LOCAL GHOSTS</title>
		<content>{The area we have charted in our       
{Domesday Project Survey does not seem 
{very rich in local taditions and      
{customs. However it does offer some   
{interesting ghost stories.See what you
{make of these.                        
{  We were told by the Plowman-Render  
{family of Back Lane that a strange    
{figure comes out on Nee Year's Eve on 
{the Raskelf Road each year. He points 
{three times at the ground and then    
{disappears.Some folk think he was the 
{victim of three murderers of the last 
{century and is now showing where they 
{have gone!                            
{  A couple of years ago Mrs Ann Wray's
{husband felt a cold wind as he lay in 
{bed.He looked into the corner of the  
{bedroom and saw his old next-door     
{neighbour doing a pirouette.Yet she   
{had been dead a year and her death had
{happened a year before to the day!    </content>
