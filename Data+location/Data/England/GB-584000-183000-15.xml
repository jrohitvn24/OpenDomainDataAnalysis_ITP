		<title>15St. Clement's Church</title>
		<content> St Clement was the third bishop of    
 Rome, a martyr who was thrown off a   
 cliff with an anchor around his leg.  
 The church was built in the fifteenth 
 century. It is an anglo-catholic      
 church. Inthe churchyard there is a   
 memorial to the men who died at       
 Dunkirk in 1940. It is in the shape of
 a big tidal wave with a sinking ship  
 and oars in the shape of a V, which   
 means victory. There is also a grave  
 which the pressgang used to sharpen   
 their cutlasses before going into Old 
 Leigh to force men into the Navy. The 
 church stands where the Broadway meets
 Broadway West and Elm Road at Leigh   
 Hill. As you go through the gate,     
 facing you is a blue door and above it
 are two shields. On the left shield is
 an anchor and leaf, and on the other  
 is a bishop's hat, staff and two keys.
