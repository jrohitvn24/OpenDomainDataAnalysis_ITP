		<content> ON THE 4 JULY on a programme called   
 Midlands Today said that the village  
 of Eyton Upon Turn was snowed in and  
 that the only way that people could   
 get about was by walking old people   
 who could not walk very far got other 
 people to walk about 5 miles to get   
 food for then.  Now that Summer is    
 here tourists are here they are       
 ruining                               
 the place they are trampling down all 
 the farmers crops so they get a bad   
 harvestin .  In some places the was a 
 green flag if the was a car under the 
 snow .  In some places the snow was   
 about 10 foot deep . ALLthe roods to  
 the village were blocked at one point.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
