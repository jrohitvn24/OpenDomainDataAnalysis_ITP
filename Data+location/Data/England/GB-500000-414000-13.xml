		<content> In this era houses were not very big  
 having two rooms upstairs and two     
 rooms downstairs.The mother and father
 and the two youngest of the family in 
 one large room and the others slept in
 another room.                         
   Down-stairs there was a kitchen     
 where they would wash,eat,and cook.   
 Their meals were meat and lots of     
 vegetables grown by their father.     
   Each family would have a pig and    
 hens,Some families would have a pet   
 dog and cat.                          
   For Christmas one family would kill 
 a pig and share it with his friend,and
 his friend would kill his pig in the  
 summer and share it.                  
   As soon as you were twelve if you   
 were a boy you could start work on the
 farm and if you were a girl you could 
 work in a big house.
