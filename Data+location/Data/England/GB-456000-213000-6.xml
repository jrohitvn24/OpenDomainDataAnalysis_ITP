		<title>06JOSEPH'S STONE</title>
		<content>Joseph's stone is found in the centre  
of the moor.It is near the route of the
old Roman Road.The Joseph Stone has now
split into two pieces.Legend tells us  
that it was an old Roman milestone or  
marker to help travellers find their   
way across the moor.It may also have   
been used as a mounting block to help  
riders get back onto their horses if   
they had dismounted.The stone only     
became known by its present name after 
the Otmoor Riots in the early 1800's.
