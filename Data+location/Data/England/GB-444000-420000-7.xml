		<title>07Employment in Pontefract.</title>
		<content> Pontefract is an old market town which
 has been granted charters to hold     
 fairs and markets since 1181.Weaving  
 and cloth making was a speciality.    
   Pontefract is famous for its        
 confectionary.Pomfret cakes which are 
 small,flat pieces of liquorice,are    
 known throughout the World.However,   
 liquorice has not been grown for many 
 years and only two of the original    
 fifteen factories remain.             
   The whole nature of the town changed
 100 years ago when the Prince of Wales
 Colliery was establisted in Tanshelf. 
 The Colliery produces nearly one      
 million tonnes of coal each year,but  
 there is a loss of Â£7 per tonne       
 produced. Coal output was increased   
 five years ago with the opening of a  
 drift mine,while an outcrop of coal is
 being excavated from fields adjoining 
 the Colliery.                         </content>
