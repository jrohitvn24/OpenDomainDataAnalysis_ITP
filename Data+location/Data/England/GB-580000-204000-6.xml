		<title>06FARMING IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Whole area is basically agricultural  
 with two small villages.We found 2    
 types of farming.Two farms were       
 traditionally worked as complete units
 under the owners with a few labourers.
 Both farms had crops and animals,     
 grazing shed held cows.Those remaining
 were satellites attached to larger    
 farms outside our area.Very little    
 machinery was kept on these farms.Both
 workers and machines were mobile,being
 brought to the farm as work demanded. 
 Crop rotation no longer used.Most land
 was under wheat for milling or animal 
 feed or malting barley.Every few years
 break crops such as oil seed rape,peas
 or beans are grown.Many large fields  
 made for modern machinery but farmers 
 are growing higher hedges to aid      
 conservation.Small orchards of apples,
 pears and plums flourish here too.
