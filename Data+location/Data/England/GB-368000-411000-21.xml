<title>21Friends of Moss Bank Park</title>
<content>

Since 2001 the Friends of Moss Bank Park have been campaigning to secure the renovation of the park in general and the Rock Garden in particular. They have seen significant progress in many areas but the Rock Garden has been the most challenging task. Last year they obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and this year (2011) has seen work on the garden progressing.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are very few Boltonians who do not have happy  memories of the Rock Garden and the Friends believe that the reopening of the renovated garden will be received with jubilation throughout the town.   &lt;br />
