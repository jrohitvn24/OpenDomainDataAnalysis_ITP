		<title>03Growth of Gnosall</title>
		<content>  The settlement of the village of     
Gnosall has grown up in two parts on   
either side of Doley Brook where the   
land was marshy. To the NE is Gnosall  
and to the SE is Gnosall Heath. The    
population of Gnosall has grown rapidly
in recent years and it is now thought  
to be the largest village in England.
