		<content>Alton West's famous housing blocks are 
fine, mighty concrete slabs set on     
stilts at right angles to the park so  
as not to be too obtrusive. The        
architects were influenced by Swedish  
design and Le Corbusier's idea of a    
city of towers standing in Parkland.   
A different building was designed for  
each dwelling type.41% is 1-2 bedrm.   
flats; 12% is 2 bedrm.maisonettes;31%  
is 3 bedrm.maisonettes;  14% is 3-4    
bedrm. houses; 2% is 1 room old        
people's dwellings. The focal point of 
the contrasting neighbourhoods is the  
junction of Danebury Avenue, Roehampton
Lane*,High Street. There is no real    
community centre, just a busy parade of
shops, a boy's club, library and High  
Street. A busy main through road*      
divides Roehampton geographically and  
socially. Local industries are K.L.G.  
and 2 limb-fitters. (cont.over)        </content>
