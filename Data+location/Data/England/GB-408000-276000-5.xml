		<content> Today the area known as Solihull Lodge
 is mainly residential with its own    
 shops and services.The houses are     
 mainly semi-detached and              
 detached,occupied by families with    
 children of all ages.                 
 Before the Second World War this area 
 was composed mainly of livestock      
 farms(pigs)and open ground. There was 
 some permanent housing along the main 
 road but elsewhere there were         
 temporary huts and caravans. There    
 were a number of large farmhouses and 
 smaller cottages. There were few shops
 and most supplies had to be bought in 
 Solihull although most of the         
 inhabitants were able to grow their   
 own fruit and vegetables.Alongside the
 main road there was a site for barrage
 balloons used during the war          
 years.Many of the area's roads have   
 names recalling rural life.           </content>
