		<title>06CHANGING FACE OF PERRANPORTH</title>
		<content> THE FIRST INHABITANTS OF PERRANPORTH  
 ABOUT WHICH ANYTHING IS KNOWN WERE    
 CREMATED AT CRIGG-A-MENNIS AT THE TOP 
 OF LISKEY HILL IN ABOUT 1300 BC.      
 PERRANPORTH WAS NAMED AFTER ST.PIRAN  
 WHO IS REPUTED TO HAVE LANDED IN THE  
 AREA AFTER JOURNEYING FROM IRELAND ON 
 A MILLSTONE.WITH IT'S GOLDEN SANDS AND
 PLEASANT CLIMATE THE TOWN HAS MORE    
 RECENTLY DEVELOPED AS A{TOURIST RESORT
 PROVIDING SHOPS AND AMENITIES FOR THE 
 SEASIDE HOLIDAY MAKER.HOWEVER THE     
 RECENT INCREASE IN PACKAGE HOLIDAYS   
 ABROAD HAS CAUSED THE TOURIST SEASON  
 TO BECOME SHORTENED TO ONLY 2 MONTHS. 
 TO TRY AND COMPENSATE FOR THIS DECLINE
 MANY HOTELS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO  
 OLD PEOPLES FLATS AND A SCHEME HAS    
 ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED TO PROVIDE HOMES 
 FOR RETIRED PEOPLE FROM THE LONDON    
 AREA. TODAY ALMOST 75% OF THE         
 POPULATION ARE RETIRED PEOPLE.        </content>
