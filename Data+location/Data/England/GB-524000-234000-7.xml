		<content>  The small amount of industrial       
 activity in this block is to be found 
 in or near Baldock.                   
                                       
  The only obvious connection with     
 farming is two former oasthouses, one 
 of which is deserted and the other is 
 a drugs warehouse.                    
                                       
  There are two light engineering works
 tucked into the residential area of N.
 Baldock and one along the A505 just   
 outside Baldock.                      
                                       
  In N. Baldock there are also two     
 builders, a printer, a furniture      
 restorer and a food packaging factory 
 which mainly does short runs for large
 firms such as General Foods.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
