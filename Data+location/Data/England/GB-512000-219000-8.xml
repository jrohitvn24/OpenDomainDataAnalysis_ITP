 The Baptist Fellowship in Breachwood  
 Green began in 1825 at Colemans Green 
 House.Later a Church was built in 1831
 and this was replaced with the present
 building in 1904.                     
 Every Sunday I go to Chapel and my Dad
 reads the notices. We have Sunday     
 School and once every month we stay in
 Church for the Family Service. After  
 Sunday School my mum sets out all the 
 chairs for the Ladies Fellowship on   
 Wednesday afternoons. On Thursday     
 mornings a coffee club is held for    
 young mums.          David Farr       
 In the Baptist chapel there is a      
 pulpit that was used by John BUNYAN   
 when he was preaching in this area.   
 There is also a Breeches Bible. It is 
 called a Breeches Bible because it    
 says in Genesis that Adam and Eve made
 themselves breeches.  Donna. Louise.  </content>
