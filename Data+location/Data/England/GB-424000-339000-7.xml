		<title>07The Church</title>
		<content> Mr.Bowles is the rector in Brailsford.
 He has been the rector for six years. 
 He has two sons and one daughter.They 
 live in a four year old rectory but   
 they lived in a five hundred year old 
 rectory.The Church stands between the 
 villages of Brailsford and Ednaston   
 to serve the people of both villages. 
 The Church was built in Saxon times   
 and is thought to be about nineteen   
 hundred years old.A yew tree by the   
 main door is about 1000 years old.The 
 six bells have been there as long as  
 records have been in existance.A Saxon
 Cross has been found in the           
 church-yard but the top of it has     
 been broken off.The stained-glass     
 windows are about 80 years old.The    
 position of the church and its        
 coldness due to infrequent use must   
 contribute to falling attendances at  
 the services.                         </content>
