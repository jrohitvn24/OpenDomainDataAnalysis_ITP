		<title>02ENGLISH CHINA CLAY</title>
		<content>      ECC (English China Clay) is a    
 very important industry to our area,  
 supplying much of the employment in   
 the St. Blazey, Par and St. Austell   
 areas.                                
      In Britain,china clay (kaolin) is
 only found in parts of Cornwall and   
 South Devon.The granite in which it is
 found, also contains mica, quartz and 
 tourmaline.                           
      For many years in Cornwall, china
 clay was obtained by washing it out of
 the kaolinised granite. Today, very   
 powerful water hoses called monitors  
 are used to direct a jet of water at  
 the pit face with enough force to     
 dislodge and remove the the clay in   
 one operation.The water pressure is in
 the region of 300 pounds per square   
 inch.
