 Bread may be purchased at bakeries    
 which produce freshly-made loaves.    
 Although more expensive this is often 
 preferable to packs of pre-sliced     
 bread avalible in supermarkets.       
 Cakes, pasteries and pudding are often
 made at home. However, it si easy to  
 buy these in packet mixes from        
 supermarkets for purposes of          
 convenience.                          
 Household cleaning equipment can be   
 bought from a supermarket or from     
 chemist stores:once again, choice and 
 value are better in larger stores.    
 Newspapers are available at           
 village stores or can be delivered    
 daily. Sometimes they may not be      
 bought on a regular basis, since      
 television and radio provide news     
 bulletins throughout the day.         </content>
