		<content>In Aston Tirrold is the church of St   
Michael. A church has existed on this  
site since 1080 and it has links with  
the Torold family who gave their name  
to the village.                        
All Saints Church, Aston Upthorpe dates
from Saxon times and the church stands 
on the site of an earlier church. This 
could be the place where King Ethelred 
remained at prayer while his brother   
Alfred defeated the Danes at the Battle
of Assendune(Ashdown). In 1862 separate
parishes of Upton and Aston Upthorpe   
were formed.                           
The United Reformed Church of Aston    
Tirrold was built in 1782 in brick and 
was a Presbyterian Church until 1972.  
It is the second oldest Non Conformist 
Church building in Berkshire. The first
school started in the village in 1827  
based on the Church.
