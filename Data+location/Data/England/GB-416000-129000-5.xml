		<content> At St Andrew's Church, two young boys,
 Martyn and Iain are responsible for   
 the bell chiming. Now, they receive   
 pocket money for ringing the bells at 
 weddings and other church services.   
 Usually Iain rings the heaviest       
 bell and Martyn rings the lighter     
 bell. Ringing starts when the couple  
 come under the arch at the entrance to
 the Church.{There are two bells recast
{by Whitechapel Foundry in 1960,       
{inscribed 'SAPLOPN'}and housed in an  
 open turret. The height of the bell   
 tower is about 15 metres . The bells  
 have an unusual{ringing arm. Unlike   
{traditional church}hung bells in this 
 country, there is no wheel joined to  
 the headstock. The bells are only able
 to be chimed by pulling a right angled
 metal arm, fitted to the top of the   
 bell. This has a chain attached to the
 ringing rope,which is jerked sharply. </content>
