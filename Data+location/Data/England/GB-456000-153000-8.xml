		<title>08AN INTERVIEW</title>
		<content> We interviewed a housewife ,who       
 lives in Wootton St. Lawrence.She has 
 lived in her house for 8 years,but in 
 the village for 11 years .She said    
 that the village hasn't changed at    
 all.There are mostly younger families 
 living in the village,but there are   
 some old people.If they can't cope    
 they have a homehelp. It is very      
 quiet when it comes to seeing         
 people.You can go for days without    
 seeing anybody. The main road         
 is very busy though.It is mainly used 
 as a cut through to bigger towns .The 
 only place where people can           
 meet socially is at a club where they 
 play badminton.The club meets every   
 Tuesday. There is no Doctor, the      
 nearest is in Oakley. There is a      
 regular bus service twice a week.     
                                       
                                       </content>
