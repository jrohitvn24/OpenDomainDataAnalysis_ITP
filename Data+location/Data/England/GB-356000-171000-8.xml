		<content> I woke up at 7.30 a.m.  Mum said we   
 were going to go down to the Bristol  
 Docks after dinner to see the Power   
 Boat racing.  When I was dressed, I   
 went to call for Sharon, my friend.   
 We went down to the market.  She      
 bought a red coat costing Â£19.99. I   
 bought a  dress costing Â£9.99.  We    
 went home and had dinner - pork,      
 potatoes and cabbage.  After dinner we
 went to the Docks.  All the boats were
 zooming round the course, going really
 fast.  It was very good.  Afterwards  
 we went to the {Lifeboat Museum} to   
 see all the old boats.  When we got   
 home it was 5 p.m. I went out on the  
 playing field till 8 p.m. then I came 
 in, had a piece of toast, watched     
 "Murder She Wrote" on T.V. till 9     
 p.m., then I went to bed and read till
 10 p.m.                               
                                       </content>
