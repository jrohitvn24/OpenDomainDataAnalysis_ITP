		<content>{   AN INTERVIEW WITH A SHOPKEEPER     
   Do you think Barton is making the   
 most of itself?                       
   Definitely not.First of all the     
 whole of Barton needs to b cleaned    
 up.The old mill,which is              
 unstable,should be demolished and so  
 should the old cattle market.Plans    
 which were made to build a supermarket
 should go ahead so there are more     
 shops which would encourage people to 
 shop in Barton.                       
   Could I have any comments you would 
 like to make on the area,namely       
 Castledyke South,which is adjacent to 
 your shop.Do you agree with the       
 council that the mill is an "eyesore"?
   I have personally been campaigning  
 to have the old mill demolished .I    
 went to the public enquiry to support 
 demolition but nothing ever came of   
 it.It certainly is an eyesore.        </content>
