		<content>{The Poor Clares'Convent}was founded in
 1850,as a poor house and Franciscan   
 Academy.Later it became a school,which
 the local Authority took over. There  
 are now 28 nuns,and 1-5 novices (over 
 the age of 20) enter each year.       
{The building}is Victorian Gothic.In   
 1983 there was a fire,but the damage  
 has been repaired,largely by the nuns.
{The main rule}is the Gospel,but       
 customs have changed through the ages.
 There is a quiet,carefree atmosphere, 
 and the nuns like to bring out each   
 other's talents.                      
{Their life}is simple.They go barefoot,
 wearing black headdresses and brown   
 tunics.They have a garden,and  are    
 vegetarians.They never buy food, or   
 leave the Convent,if it can be helped.
{They have no radio or TV,}unless there
 is a Coronation or Royal Wedding. They
 keep cats and dogs as pets.           </content>
