		<title>20HUTTON ESTATE - SKELTON SHOW</title>
		<content>  Every year the Skelton Horticultural 
 and Agricultural Society's annual show
 is held in the Old Park on the third  
 Saturday in August.  Although the     
 Society is over 100 years old, the    
 1985 Show will be the Ninety Fifth.   
  Originally one of many small village 
 shows, it was held at Skelton, but it 
 has thrived while others have died and
 has been at Hutton for a number of    
 years.  The Skelton Show has now      
 become one of the premier smaller     
 shows in the North of England.        
  The 1984 Show had over 1300 livestock
 exhibits, and 1000 entries in the     
 industrial section, while a crowd of  
 more than 10000 attended. In addition 
 to the competitive classes, there is a
 number of attractions, including the  
 Lakeland Country Princess Competition.
