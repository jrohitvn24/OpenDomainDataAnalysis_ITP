		<title>18THE CLOCKHOUSE:UPMINSTER</title>
		<content>   The building and grounds of the     
 historic clockhouse stands facing the 
 main road near Upminster town centre. 
{Throughout its history it has         
{reflected the changing character of   
{the area around it.                   
   The clockhouse was originally built 
 in 1775 as a coach house for a{country
{manor}called New Place.               
   In 1924 New Place Manor was         
 demolished and the Clockhouse was     
 taken by{Hornchurch Urban District    
{Council as a Public library.}The      
 building was old and decay set in.It  
 was in fact infested by beetles and so
 all the books were transferred to the 
 present library in Corbets Tey Rd.    
   Now the clockhouse is used as a     
 number of{flats}although the grounds  
 behind it have been made into an      
 attractive park complete with a moat  
 on which the Manor once stood.        </content>
