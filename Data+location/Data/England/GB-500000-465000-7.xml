		<content> The 21 acre field will however be     
 ready first. In December mum and dad  
 go away for 2 days and Stan and Les   
 look after the farm. At the end of    
 December the snow usually begins to   
 fall and we have to build shelters for
 the sheep. The corn is still going    
 from the sheds and some of the big    
 lorries get stuck up our road. At the 
 end of February the sheep begin to    
 lamb and we have to get the sheds set 
 up. Dad has to get up in the middle of
 the night to see if any of the sheep  
 have lambed. I get up at half-past 6  
 but mum gets up at half-past 4. When  
 the lambing is finished it will be    
 about 3 weeks before we start         
 clipping. It is only a days work for  
 our contractor. If it is hot in the   
 next 2 weeks we have to dip the sheep 
 for flies.
