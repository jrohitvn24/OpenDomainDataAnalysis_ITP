		<title>06STILE HOUSE CROSS</title>
		<content>     Stile House is the name given to a
farm in the north-west sector of the   
Bradnop study area. Half a mile from   
the farm in an easterly direction lies 
one of the biggest mysteries associated
with Bradnop. In a field one can find a
monument - "Stile House Cross". It is  
about 9 feet high although it has lost 
its top stone. The monument has a      
hexagonal shaft which is mounted on a  
three step plinth. The top step is     
hexagonal whilst THE other two are     
rounded.                               
     Nobody is sure why the shrine was 
placed in such an isolated spot or why 
it was built. Local rumour suggests it 
was either a meeting place for the     
parish or built to ward off the plague.
