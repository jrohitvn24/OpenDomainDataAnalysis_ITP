		<content>Brands Hatch Racing Circuit-the second 
longest in Great Britain is just out-  
side our grid for Fawkham but close to 
it &amp; in the grid are several appendages
A hut is used by the British Racing &amp;  
Sports Car Club,there are buildings to 
do with running the circuit,car parks, 
camping sites for large Grand Prix     
meetings &amp; a small private air strip   
where light aircraft &amp; helicopters land
Employment for Fawkham residents is    
likely &amp; the pub no doubt benefits from
race meetings. The rear exit leads to  
the A20 or M20 or onto minor roads     
through the villages.After a race      
meeting all roads are heavily congested
with home going traffic mostly heading 
for London. Grand Prix are held twice a
year with famous drivers taking part.
