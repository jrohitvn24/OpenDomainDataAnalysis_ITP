		<title>18THE SUB-POST OFFICE, ASHTON</title>
		<content>   The sub-post office at{Ashton under 
{Hill}is contained in an old thatched  
 cottage that is about 400 years old.  
 It has had several uses including a   
 shoe repair business. All the ceilings
 are beamed and very low and the rooms 
 are very small. The post office is    
 kept very busy at a time when many    
 others are being forced to close.     
   Villagers are kept up to date about 
 local events by consulting the special
 calender there, also using this when  
 arranging other functions to avoid    
 dates clashing. A large notice board  
 is available to advertise goods for   
 sale and situations vacant at the rate
 of 10 pence per week.                 
   The post office has been run by the 
 Whitehead family for over 40 years,   
 the present postmaster being the son. 
   It continues to be an essential     
 "gossip" shop for the village.        </content>
