		<content> A{Cinderford}man remembers sighting   
{Halleys Comet}in 1910.He was 14 years 
 old at the time.He hopes to see it    
 again 12th December.It is not expected
 to be such a good sighting as the one 
 in 1910.Because we are not in the     
 right Hemisphere.There are also other 
 Comets in the sky.A special display   
 about{Halleys Comet}in 1066 can be    
 seen in{Gloucester}City Museum.It was 
 much brighter then_it was seen by the 
 people then as an omen of bad         
 fortune.The Comet only returns every  
{76_78 years.A computer will help you  
 to find out where to look in the sky  
 for the Comet beetween now and Febuary
 1986.The weather forecast on          
 television also helps you to find out 
 where the comet is at the moment.
