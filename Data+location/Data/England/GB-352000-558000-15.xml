		<title>15Health, local hospital.</title>
		<content> The Brampton Memorial Hospital is a   
 small cottage hospital which serves   
 Brampton and the neighbouring         
 parishes. Very occasionally, in       
 emergency, a patient from Carlisle is 
 admitted.                             
 The hospital was built after the first
 world war with money raised by the    
 local people and maintained by them   
 until 1948 when it was taken over by  
 the National Healt Service.           
 A nursing officer, one of a community 
 team, is in charge of the hospital.   
 Throughout the 24 hours of the day, a 
 trained nurse and an auxiliary are on 
 duty. A physiotherapist visits daily. 
 There is a cook and some domestic     
 staff. Voluntary helpers come daily   
 and the League of Friends help with   
 transport of day patients visiting,   
 providing and arranging flowers and   
 doing patients shopping.              </content>
