		<content>  Recreation has to be self-made or    
 sought outside the area.  There are no
 playing fields or organised games,    
 though some women take part in        
 recreational activities arranged by   
 the Women's Institutes, mainly        
 swimming, bowling, bridge. rounders.  
 Gardening is probably the single most 
 popular recreation.There are many     
 beautiful gardens, both large and     
 small, tended with much quiet         
 enjoyment by their owners. Two fox    
 hunts,North Ledbury and Clifton on    
 Teme, cross the area, though not all  
 landowners welcome them. Others ride  
 simply for pleasure. There is some    
 rough shooting over the farmland.     
 There is a mobile library which calls 
 once a month.
