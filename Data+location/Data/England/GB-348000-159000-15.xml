		<title>15THE DO_IT_YOURSELF MOVEMENT.</title>
		<content>    UP TO 300 YEARS AGO PEOPLE DID MOST
 THINGS FOR THEMSELVES.NOW WE HAVE     
 SPECIAL MACHINES AND PEOPLE WITH      
 SPECIALIZED JOBS, SO WE PAY FOR       
 THINGS TO BE DONE FOR US.             
    ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MACHINES, MOST    
 PEOPLE STILL LIKE TO DO SOME THINGS   
 FOR THEMSELVES.FATHERS DO QUITE A BIT 
 OF "DO_IT_YOURSELF" SUCH AS CAR       
 MENDING, MAKING FURNITURE, PUTTING UP 
 SHELVES, DECORATING, MENDING ORGANS,  
 FIXING OLD BOATS, MAKING SWIMMING     
 POOLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.           
    MOTHERS,AUNTIES AND GRANNIES ALL   
 DO MUCH THE SAME THING, LIKE KNITTING,
 SEWING, GARDENING AND MAKING OR       
 MENDING CLOTHES.                      
    ALTHOUGH IT IS USUAL FOR MOTHERS TO
 COOK AND FATHERS TO MEND THE CAR, IN  
 MANY FAMILES THEY CHANGE ROUND ON     
 OCCASIONS AND FATHERS COOK AND MOTHERS
 MEND THE CAR!                         </content>
