		<content> After school on Tuesday afternoon,I   
 play badminton at Canford Heath       
 Community Centre.There is only one    
 court in the hall.Badminton is a good 
 sport and hobby.I have a Slazenger    
 racket which is quite heavy for me.I  
 am quite good at half court           
 singles.The lady who teaches us is    
 called Margaret Bainton.              
  My name is Robert. I am 12 years old.
 When I get home from school I go over 
 the heath to play on the B.M.X track  
 called the humps'n'bumps.It was made  
 by some chidren who live on the heath.
 It has got whoops,step- ups,camels and
 speed jumps.I have got a Viceroy B.M.X
 bike with CW handlebars and 2         
 different coloured tyres.I have got a 
 B.M.X ramp that I made in the summer  
 holidays and I have got a Trax Pro    
 B.M.X helmet which is black and yellow
 to match the colour of my bike.       </content>
