		<title>01The Town Centre of Skegness</title>
		<content> Skegness is a middle-sized seaside    
 resort, purposely designed in the 19th
 century. The resort caters for many   
 visitors during the summer months,    
 while the townspeople enjoy a varied  
 range of activities during the "closed
 season". Although it seems to be the  
 trend for more of the seafront hotels 
 to open during the Christmas period.  
 The majority of the area is dedicated 
 to the tourist industry in the form of
 railway, amusements, shopping and     
 residences for holiday makers,        
 including caravan sites.              
 Many of the residents are elderly,    
 retired people who enjoy the climate  
 and the comparative quiet of area out 
 of season.                            
  The symbol of Skegness is{"The Jolly 
{Fisherman"}.
