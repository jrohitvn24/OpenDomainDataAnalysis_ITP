		<content> Burnewhall and Tower Farms support    
 their own beasts off their own        
 ground.                               
 The Burnewhall herd lies out all      
 winter in a five acre field which is  
 re_seeded with rye_grass each         
 spring.They are fed on silage and kale
 and there is a sheltered yard with an 
 easy_feed system.                     
 "Obviously we'd get a higher yield if 
 they were housed,"Phil says:"But I'm  
 satisfied with the results".His       
 records prove it.Last year Burnewhall 
 produced 6,874 litres with 3.99%      
 butter fat,an excellent return.Phil   
 used to export his surplus heifers to 
 France but since quotas, he's sold    
 them on the home market.He has 40 to  
 sell this year and not surprisingly   
 they're toppers every one.
