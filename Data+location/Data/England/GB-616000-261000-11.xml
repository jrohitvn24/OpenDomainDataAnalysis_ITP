		<title>11Antiques in Debenham (1).</title>
		<content>  Debenham has an unusually large      
number of antique shops and people     
employed in the furniture trade.       
  The present owner has been in Dove   
Antique Shop since 1984.She stocks     
mainly Victorian,Edwardian and 1920s   
porcelain,silverware and furniture.She 
intends to keep small items,suitable   
for presents, and hopes to turn the    
outbuildings into a teashop.           
  In contrast,Flemings Antiques stock  
expensive items from earlier periods.  
They used to deal mainly in Tudor      
oak furniture which was in vogue twenty
years ago,but this is now hard to      
obtain.There is now a demand for later,
less cumbersome pieces such as         
seventeenth,eighteenth and nineteenth  
century furniture for the dining room, 
sitting room and garden.They have      
supplied antiques to farmers,          
politicians and pop stars.             </content>
