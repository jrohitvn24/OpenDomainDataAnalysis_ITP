		<title>10The West Essex Gazette</title>
		<content>   The Gazette is a popular local      
{newspaper,}and has around fifty       
 thousand readers in the Loughton area.
 The Gazette has over one-hundred      
 stories each week. The most exciting  
 story over the past year was a lady   
 giving birth in a mini. To be a       
{reporter}you need two A-levels. You   
 also have to learn a law-book. Three  
 reporters cover the area of, Loughton,
 Buckhurst Hill and Chigwell.          
  Sometimes they have too much news to 
 print in the paper.To print with they 
 use a machine called a Lithographic.  
 Nearly every week they have about one 
 complaint (normally over a printing   
 error). The reporter we talked to     
 found it a very interesting job.      
  Generally the paper is read so that  
 people know what is going on in the   
 area, or they buy it if someone they  
 know is mentioned in the news.        </content>
