hut from the Great Western line        
between  Brill and Ludgershall.It was  
given to  the village by Sir Henry     
Verney.Oakley shop sells all sorts of  
food and provisions.Our school was     
opened in  1958,and was extended in    
1968 to  enclude the tower blok.There  
used to be a school in School Lane     
with the  headmistress's house next    
door.Oakley  garage is very near our   
school.It  is not self-service but     
sells petrol and does servicing. In    
Oakley there are two pubs -The Chandos 
Arms and The Royal Oak.The Foresters   
pub  closed in 1915.The Sun is also    
closed, it is a house.The cellar is    
still part  of the house and the old   
sign hangs on the front door.The Post  
Office has  recently moved from the    
old bakery to the Turnpike.
