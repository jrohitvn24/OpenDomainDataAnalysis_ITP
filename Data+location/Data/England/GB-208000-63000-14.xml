		<title>14LIFE IN RESPRYN PARISH</title>
		<content> The{National Trust}owns many of the   
 seven houses that form{Respryn Parish.
 Most of the people who live there     
 are employed on the {Lanhydrock       
{Estate.}The length of time that people
 have lived in the area ranges from 30 
 to 84 years, but they have noticed    
 very little building or modernisation 
 work during that time.                
    One of the villagers owns a {farm} 
 of about 240 acres. His main activity 
 is based on the 600 sheep that he     
 keeps.He is involved during the year  
 with lambing,dipping and shearing his 
 sheep.The farmer also keeps about 50  
 cows that have to be milked twice     
 daily,and several pigs that have to be
 cleaned regularly.He has numerous     
 horses and dog to help with work      
 around the farm. The farmer enjoys his
 life, but has to travel 3 miles to do 
 his shopping.                         </content>
