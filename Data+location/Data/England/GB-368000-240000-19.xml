		<content> Although most people are{employed in  
{Ledbury}and some{commute}even further,
 there is some{local work}on the farms.
 Withers fruit farm takes on{40 pickers
 in the season and there is a  small   
 private{saw mill}on one farm, the     
 farmer selling logs to the village.   
 Arknell Farm, however, has sold its   
 land and is just a private house.     
                                       
 The{old village school}was bought in  
 1955. The  school house was converted 
 into a more luxurious home and the    
 school was used to store items for    
 an{antique business.}In 1984 the      
 entirely family business progressed to
{wood-stripping;}old furniture being   
{repaired and renovated.               
 Near the village at Loxter, there is  
 an{underground reservoir,}operated by 
 the Welsh Water Authority.
