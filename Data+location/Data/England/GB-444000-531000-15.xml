		<title>15St.Peter's Church,Elwick.</title>
		<content> Elwick church is named after Saint    
 Peter. It is an old Norman church     
 built on even older foundations. It is
 probably built on an old Saxon        
 defensive  settlement. Built in to the
 walls are two Saxon religious stone   
 carvings. One is of Adam and Eve and  
 the other is the head of a Saxon      
 cross. The existing church was started
 in 1195 and the last major alterations
 were done in the early nineteenth     
 century,when the tower was heightened.
 Recently a reconditioned church organ 
 was put in at a cost of about Â£4,500. 
 Last year the church tower was in such
 a bad state of repair that Â£40,000 had
 to be raised to repair the tower. The 
 church is separated now from the      
 village by a deep ghyll. It is likely 
 that the existing village grew up in  
 the middle ages,long after the church 
 was built.                            </content>
