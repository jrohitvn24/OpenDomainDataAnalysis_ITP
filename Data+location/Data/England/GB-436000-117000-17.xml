		<title>17THE ANDOVER REDBRIDGE CANAL</title>
		<content> The{Old Canal}is almost{191}years old 
 and it took barges from{Andover}to    
{Redbridge}in{Southampton}carrying     
 food and livestock. The construction  
 was started in July 1789 and it was   
 finished in January 1794 .Now the old 
 canal is filled with flowers , weeds  
 and trees. The most popular flower    
 there  is the{Yellow Iris.}The        
 canal was first called The Navigable  
 canal and it went from Andover to     
 Redbridge in the county of            
 Southampton.The canal is 22 miles 4   
 furlongs and 9 chains long. However,  
 it was only used for 20 or 30 years   
 before falling into disuse.  Most     
 of the old canal is now wet and boggy.
 A small section of the canal can still
 be seen at{Lee}near{Romsey , Hampshire
