		<title>03    ARTS AND CRAFTS</title>
		<content> In the Circle Community Association   
 arts and crafts room every Tuesday    
 afternoon a group of disabled people, 
 many of them stroke victims,get       
 together with the help of the DHSS to 
 make things in their spare time.      
 We saw an old disabled man doing a    
 tapestry, not yet finshed although it 
 has taken 12 months already.          
  A partly paralysed and blinded old   
 lady working on soft toys, made a     
 clothed toy mouse, sent it to the     
 Barbican in London and won a          
 certificate for her hard work and     
 technique.                            
  Other things that were being made    
 were:matting,tea cosies,patterned     
 wicker trays and plastic plant        
 holders.                              
  People enjoy the classes and take the
 opportunity to have a chat.
