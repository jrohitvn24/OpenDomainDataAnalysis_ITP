		<content> Practically every home has a colour   
 television,and they provide most of   
 the entertainment people enjoy during 
 an evening.Lots of people have video  
 recorders as well, and they either    
 record programmes or hire films to    
 watch.Lots of children stay up late to
 watch and then they are tired in the  
 school next morning.                  
 People have a daily paper each day.The
 papers come down from London by train.
 Two local papers are published each   
 Thursday,they are called the "Cornish 
 Guardian" and the"Cornwall Courier".  
 The Guardian is  bigger than the      
 Courier,but the Courier is printed in 
 clearer print than the Guardian.Both  
 papers are eagerly looked for each    
 week as local events and pictures are 
 in them,and people like to see their  
 name in print.There is also a local   
 broadsheet printed and delivered free.</content>
