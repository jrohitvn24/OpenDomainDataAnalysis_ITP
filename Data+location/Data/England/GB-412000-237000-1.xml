		<content> The area is situated in the north of  
 Gloucestershire close to the north-   
 facing Cotswold edge.Crossing the area
 from S.W.to N.E.is the valley of the  
 Cam, a small stream. The ground rises 
 to 214 m at the N.W. margin then falls
 rapidly to 95 m through Weston        
 Park.South of the valley the land     
 rises gently to 246 m as it rises to  
 the high Cotswolds. Within the        
 valley,surrounded by hills,lies       
 Chipping Campden with Broad Campden a 
 kilometre to the S.E. Most of the 2000
 (approx) inhabitants of the area live 
 here. The area is farmland with       
 expanses of deciduous woodland and    
 copses. Hedges and dry stonewalls     
 outline the fields which still present
 a colourful patchwork of crops in the 
 summer. The roads serve the area well 
 and allow easy access to the large    
 towns round about.                    </content>
