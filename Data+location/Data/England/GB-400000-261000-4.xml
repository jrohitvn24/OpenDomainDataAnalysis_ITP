		<content> MY DAY -THE HEADMISTRESS              
                                       
 Iarrive at school at about 8.15am.    
 I unlock the school as there is no    
 caretaker. The first thing I do is put
 the kettle on and make myself a cup of
 tea. Then I open the post. Most of the
 post goes straight in the bin as it is
 unsolicited mail.                     
                                       
   Then I leave the secretary a list of
 things to be done. She is kept very   
 busy as she only works 12 hours a     
 week. She deals with letters,         
 duplicating, forms for the office,    
 school fund, savings and dinner money.
                                       
   At 8.45 the bell goes for the start 
 of the day. There are only two of us  
 on the teaching staff. We take it in  
 turns to take assembly.
