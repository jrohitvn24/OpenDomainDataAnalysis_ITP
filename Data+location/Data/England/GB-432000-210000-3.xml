The first record of cloth making in    
Witney was in 1179 when a Witney       
weaver  was fined 6s.8d.               
                                       
Blanket making in Early's of Witney    
began in 1669 and the firm changed its 
name to Charles Early and              
Marriot,                               
but is now just Early's of Witney.     
Early's of Witney has been at the      
centre of Blanket making in Witney for 
over 300 years and is now the only     
surviving blanket making factory       
in Witney. Early's of Witney takes up  
part of Mill  Street. The chairman of  
Earlys of Witney is N.S.Wooding.
