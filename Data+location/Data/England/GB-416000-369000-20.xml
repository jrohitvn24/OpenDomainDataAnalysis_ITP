		<title>20ASHFORD MEMORIAL HALL</title>
		<content> It was built as a memorial after the  
 1914_19 war to be used as a village   
 hall for purposes of recreation and   
 education.Responsibility is vested in 
 5 trustees and run by an elected      
 committee. The snooker_room is still  
 popular in 1985,but it is no longer   
 necessary to provide a daily newspaper
 for public use since the advent of    
 television.It has been used to extend 
 Ashford Primary School's facilities.  
 The school uses it for School meals   
 every day,games lessons in Winter and 
 concerts when a stage is needed.It    
 provides holiday accommodation for    
 small groups of Brownies and Wolf     
 cubs.                                 
  The Institute occupies the site of   
 some old thatched cottages and stands 
 on land donated by the Duke of        
 Devonshire.
