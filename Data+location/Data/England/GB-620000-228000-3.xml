		<title>03Three local schools</title>
		<content> Children in this area begin their {   
{Education}at one of 3 local schools.  
{Chase lane}school is only 19 years    
 old,and was built to cater for those  
 who live in the area of Upper         
 Dovercourt.{Ramsey}school is also a   
 primary school,taking pupils from the 
 village of Ramsey itself,and also     
 those children who have reached junior
 age in Little Oakley.These are        
 collected each morning by a bus which 
 then drops them off at school,and     
 collects them in the evening.         
 In{Little Oakley}there is a tiny C of 
 E infants school,which was built in   
 1845;although it's first teacher(Miss 
 S.Turner)was not recorded until       
 1875.Originally it had one room plus  
 accomodation for the teacher.It now   
 has two teachers and 31 pupils,and    
 because it is such an important part  
 of the village will be kept open.     </content>
