		<content>      St. Peter's Church is in         
 Curdridge, in the Diocese of          
 Portsmouth.  In 1835 a Chapel of Ease 
 was built to save the parishioners    
 travelling to Bishops Waltham for     
 services.  The porch can still be     
 seen.  The foundation stone of the    
 present church was laid in 1887, and  
 seven years later the tower was built 
 in memory of Sir Charles Cory.  It    
 contains a ring of eight bells which  
 are the fourth heaviest in the        
 country, and unsurpassed in tone.     
      There is no vicar at Curdridge at
 present, so the services are taken by 
 the{Reader.}He takes family services, 
 and special services at Harvest       
 Festival, Christmas and Easter.  He   
 can conduct funerals, but he may not  
 baptise or marry people.  He visits   
 the sick and sad in the parish.  He   
 does not get paid for his Church work.</content>
