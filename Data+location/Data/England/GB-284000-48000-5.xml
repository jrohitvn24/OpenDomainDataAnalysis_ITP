		<title>05BEACON BOATHOUSE,SOUTH TOWN</title>
		<content> The 17th century boathouse belonged to
 Manor House, which was pulled down in 
 1905 because South Town was too narrow
 for carriages.In the 19th century,the 
 boathouse was used by coastguards,they
 watched the mouth of the river to     
 check that ships were not smuggling in
 tobacco,French brandy etc..They kept  
 their brigs in the boathouse and had  
 workrooms in a house with a balcony   
 nextdoor,now used as bedrooms.A       
 leading light on the river wall       
 steers boats safely into harbour.When 
 the family moved here in 1963,they    
 payed weekly rent of Â£4.50 to         
 Dartmouth Charities,now it is Â£43.They
 filled in the boatslip and built an   
 architect's office,but you can still  
 see some of the old roofbeams.The     
 first-floor room has big picture      
 windows on the S and E side and wood  
 panelling on the walls.               </content>
