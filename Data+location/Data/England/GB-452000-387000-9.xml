		<content> Horse riding is a very important      
 leisure industry in our area. Many    
 people own their own horses and there 
 are many riding stables. Mrs. Green   
 owns a stable in our area and she     
 explained some important things to do 
 with owning a riding stable. These are
 the most important.                   
 1. Horse riding in our area is        
 increasing because people seem to be  
 working less hours and many are out of
 work. Also this is a very good area   
 for riding.                           
 2. Riding can be tailored to suit     
 individual needs. Whether a person is 
 experienced or not it can be exciting,
 relaxing, energetic, competitive, fast
 or slow.                              
 3. The weather does not stop riding.  
 It is just as enjoyable whether it is 
 sunny or raining. Even in very cold   
 weather, the rider keeps warm.        </content>
