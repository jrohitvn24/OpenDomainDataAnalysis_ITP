		<content> Our area is in the very north east    
 corner of the county of Devon.In fact 
 the county boundary is only about half
 a mile from our school.We are on the  
 very edge of a part of Devon which is 
 very hilly and if we climb to the top 
 of Chimney Down there is a good view  
 for many miles to the east,north and  
 south.It is quite a steep climb up to 
 Hockworthy and Staple Cross but we go 
 downhill to Westleigh and Burlescombe.
 We are on the edge of the Culm Valley 
 although the River Culm is about six  
 miles from us and we look across to   
 the Blackdown Hills on the other side 
 of the valley.The soil here is quite  
 shallow and underneath there is shale 
 stone.
