		<content>   Our primary school is a small but   
 quite modern village school.It was    
 built in 1971 on a field next to      
 Portal House.Previously children had  
 attended the old school which was in  
 Kingsdown Road.                       
   The school has 5 classes with one   
 spare classroom which is used for     
 Music and Television.There is one hall
 in which we do PE and eat our lunch.  
 There are 160 pupils in the school-   
 they are mainly village children-and  
 six members of staff.
