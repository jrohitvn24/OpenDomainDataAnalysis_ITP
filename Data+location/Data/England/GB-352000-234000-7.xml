		<title>07WILCOX AND SONS 2</title>
		<content> The firm has been in Holme Lacy for 7 
 years, but Mr Wilcox has had it for 15
 years.   He has{12 workers}now, but he
 had 25 before he bought his modern    
{machinery,}which is{all British.      
 When he had the old machines, he      
 employed people from the village,     
 but he says they were not able to     
 pick up the skills to use the new     
 machines, so his workers mostly       
 come from{Hereford.  }This is a pity, 
 as it means the only firm in the      
 village cannot provide work for the   
 people who live there. The            
 machinery he has got is worth         
 Â£500,000.                             
 The work they do is so precise,       
 because so many of the machines are   
 computer-driven, and his prices are so
 reasonable, that he gets a lot of{work
{from all over the country.
