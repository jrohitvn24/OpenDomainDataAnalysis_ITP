		<content>    We have 10 farms in our area. Four 
 of these are still working, two are   
 stables and the remainder are private 
 homes.{Slyfield}is the largest farm   
 and many of the smaller farms belong  
 to it. The farm is run by a tenant    
 farmer.                               
   {Woodlands Farm}has 250 acres. Some 
 barley is grown but most of the land  
 is used to graze horses and cows. The 
 horses are for the enjoyment of the   
 owners only.{Woodlands Court Farm}has 
 75 acres. This is used to rear        
 chickens and turkeys.                 
   {Sheepbell Farm}stopped being a     
 working farm in 1975. It used to own  
 cows and pigs. Now all that is left is
 the 17 century house.                 
    The 55 acres of{Pachesham Farm}is  
 used as an equestrian centre.{Barracks
{Farm}is still a working farm.
