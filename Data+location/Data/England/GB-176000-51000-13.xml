		<title>13Life Style Near Goonhavern</title>
		<content> Ours is a rural district with small   
 villages  scattered throughout.       
 Life here, I think can be described   
 as tranquil but may be regarded as    
 slow compared wth town life.A number  
 of residents are inter related and    
 nearly everbody knows everbody else   
 .There is a strong community spirit   
 and overall , people care for one     
 another.Respect is shown to elders    
 whose opions are valued.Children are  
 expected to be well mannered and to   
 conform to an expected standard of    
 behavior.A lot of importance is       
 attached to education and academic    
 attainment.Similarly success in       
 physical achievements is sought after.
 There is atendancy to distrust new    
 ideas and to prefer traditoinal tried 
 and tested routines but modern,up to  
 date gadgets are present in most      
 homes.                                </content>
