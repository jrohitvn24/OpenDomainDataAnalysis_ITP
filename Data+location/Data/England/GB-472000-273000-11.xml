		<content>Disused Railway Line-Part of abandoned 
line from Northampton-Market Harborough
closed 1960.Sold to -                  
   Nothampton Steam Railway Society.   
They have bought a locomotive and two  
coaches and hope,when repaired, to use 
them for Week end pleasure travel.     
   We walked along the line for 1 km   
until we came to a fence.We climbed it 
and looked for signs of wild life.We   
saw 14 different animals,birds and     
insects.                               
  We turned round and went back along  
our measured Km collecting plants.We   
found 20 different ones.When we got    
back to school we classified them.     
  The railway track was rusty and some 
of it was ripped up.
