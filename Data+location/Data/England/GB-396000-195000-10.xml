 school bus in {Poole Keynes.}When I   
 got to school, I had a little         
 playtime. I had an assembly. After    
 that we had a spelling test and I     
 worked on the {Domesday Survey.}At    
 10.30 I had a playtime. Then I did    
 some maths and some{Domesday }work. At
 midday, I had my school dinner.       
 Afterwards I had half an hour's
