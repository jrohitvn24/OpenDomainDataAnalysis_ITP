 There were in fact four pockets of    
 housing,all of a somewhat exclusive   
 character,mainly semi-detached,       
 set-back from the roads,with quite    
 substantial gardens.These were :      
 (a).the cottages at Mote End Farm,    
 (b).housing in Hendon Wood Lane,      
 (c).housing in Barnet Gate Lane,      
 (d).housing in Hyver Hall.            
 There were also some isolated farm    
 cottages in Totteridge Lane.          
 Indeed it could be said that the      
 housing was concentrated at the north 
 end of Hendon Wood and Barnet Gate    
 Lanes at their junction with Wood     
 Lane,a main road and bus routes       
 between Barnet and the A1.It was      
 generally of a straggling ribbon      
 development on one rather than both   
 sides of the road.
