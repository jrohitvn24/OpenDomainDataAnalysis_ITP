		<title>01General review of the region</title>
		<content>The area stretches from the outlying   
houses of the village of Gretton in the
north to the edge of an industrial zone
on the outskirts of Corby in the south 
east, which has been developed on land 
reclaimed from opencast iron ore       
mining.To the south west reclaimed land
has been planted with coniferous and   
some deciduous trees.A recent waymarked
public footpath from Gretton Brook Road
to Gretton passes through these woods  
before coming to the open farmland that
is to be found beyond the old mining   
sites.Pheasant covers and shooting     
hides are to be found in the woods and 
add to the leisure and recreational    
provision.The northbound main lines of 
the Midland railway to Nottingham from 
Glendon south Junction near Kettering  
pass through the region including most 
of the mile long Corby tunnel.
