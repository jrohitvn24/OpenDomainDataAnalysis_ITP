		<title>19THE ISLE OF GRAIN</title>
		<content>    THE{ISLE OF GRAIN}IS SITUATED TO   
 THE WEST OF THE ISLE OF{ SHEPPEY}AND  
 LIES ON THE HOO PENINSULA.IT IS       
 SEPARATED FROM SHEPPEY BY THE MOUTH OF
 THE RIVER MEDWAY.                     
    THE SECTION OF GRAIN IN OUR        
 DOMESDAY BLOCK IS MAINLY MARSHLAND,   
 AND IS LARGELY UNINHABITED.THERE IS   
 THE SMALL VILLAGE OF GRAIN BUT APART  
 FROM THAT IT THE BLOCK CONTAINS NO    
 OTHER SETTLEMENT.                     
    THERE WAS A LARGE{OIL REFINERY}ON  
 THE ISLE OF GRAIN BUT THIS WAS CLOSED 
 DOWN A FEW YEARS AGO AND IS NOW BEING 
 DEMOLISHED. SO WHAT WAS ONCE ONE OF   
 THE BUSIEST SHIPPING LANES FOR OIL    
 TANKERS AROUND BRITISH SHORES IS NOW  
 EMPTY OF THESE HUGE SHIPS AND THE     
 DOCKING FACILITIES LIE UNUSED.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
