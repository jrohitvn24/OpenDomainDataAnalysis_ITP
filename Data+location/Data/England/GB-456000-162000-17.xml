		<content> The Kennet Valley is a rich source of 
 high quality gravel much needed for   
 the building programmes in West Berk- 
 shire and North Hampshire. A new      
 scheme due to start late in 1985 will 
 entail the extraction of 150,000      
 tonnes per year of aggregates from    
 pits just outside the survey area. At 
 20 tonnes per lorry the estimated     
 number of lorry movements is 15,000   
 per year or an average of 54.5 per    
 day. These will travel through Wasing 
 and Aldermaston over old narrow       
 bridges and winding lanes, as well as 
 through a village street before reach-
 ing the processing plant at Paices    
 Hill. The Thames Water Authority were 
 called out nine times in a week to one
 village recently to repair broken     
 water mains, their verdict was that   
 this was due to too much heavy traffic
 with too high an axle loading.        </content>
