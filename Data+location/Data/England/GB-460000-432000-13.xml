		<content> In Barlby we have five play areas     
 where we can play on swings,slides and
 round-a-bouts or just play ball games.
 Some children belong to the 1st       
 Osgodby Scouts and Guides who meet in 
 a hut behind the Methodist Chapel each
 week.                                 
 There is a Youth Club at the High     
 School which meets on Mondays,        
 Wednesdays and Fridays.Each night is  
 for a different age group between     
 eleven and eighteen years old.        
 In the Summer months we can go        
 swimming at the open_air pool at the  
 High School.                          
 For children under five years old     
 there is a Playgroup every morning at 
 the Chapel.                           
 There is a pond behind Northfield     
 where children go fishing.            
 When not playing out with our friends 
 we spend our time watching television.</content>
