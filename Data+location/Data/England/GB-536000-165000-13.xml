		<title>13A Day in My Life</title>
		<content>   On Sunday 2nd June I got up, got    
dressed and made my bed. After break-  
fast Dad went out and Mum said that we 
would go to the allotments. When we got
there I saw my neighbours and I went   
off with them. They were recording the 
songs of birds on their tape recorder. 
We went down to the stream and crossed 
over it. We went along the side and we 
got scratched and stung from the net-  
tles and brambles. Then we came to a   
clump of tall nettles. The younger of  
the two brothers decided to climb up   
the fence and jump over the nettles.   
After he had gone over there was a     
SPLASH! I said that I thought he had   
fallen in the stream. We went through  
the nettles and pulled him out. After  
lunch I went into my garden and did    
some sunbathing. Later I went in and   
read a book, had tea and went to bed.
