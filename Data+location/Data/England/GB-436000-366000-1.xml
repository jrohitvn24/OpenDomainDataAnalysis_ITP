		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO WINGERWORTH</title>
		<content>{    Wingerworth}has developed from a  
 village of 1473 inhabitants in 1951 to
 a dormitory settlement of over 6200 in
 1984.  80% of the housing has been    
 built since 1945.                     
    It is a picturesque village        
 surrounded by farm and woodland, much 
 of which is under preservation order. 
 The residents take a pride in its     
 appearance, winning the 'Best Kept    
 Large Village' competition several    
 times.                                
    There are a large number of leisure
 facilities provided, including open   
 play areas, woodland and the 'main    
 attraction', The Lido, a large pond   
 which is ecologically important.      
    The only main industry in the      
 village is the NCB. Avenue Coking     
 Plant and Bole Hill Quarry. Most of   
 the inhabitants go to Chesterfield or 
 Clay Cross to work.                   </content>
