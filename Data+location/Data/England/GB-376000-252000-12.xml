         {LEIGH AND BRANSFORD          
                                       
      Originally there were two work-  
 shops for the repair of agricultural  
 machinery but the one at Bransford    
 began to diversify into the production
 of new machines in 1975.  The business
 changed hands in 1982 and now concent-
 rates solely on making plant potting  
 machines and similar original designs 
 for the nursery business.             
                                       
      The machinery is intended to be  
 of particular use in 'third world'    
 countries and thus attention is paid  
 to ease of servicing.  Exports go     
 mainly to the Middle East and the firm
 exhibits in Europe, as well as        
 Britain. There are four employees.    
                                       
                                       </content>
