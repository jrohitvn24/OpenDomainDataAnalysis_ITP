		<title>16THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Sutton C.of E.School opened in 1877   
 and now houses the 24 Junior children.
 The 19 Infants use the Village        
 Institute which is partitioned into   
 the classroom and the hall/dining     
 room.  There are two full_time        
 teachers and one nine hours.          
 The school has no playing field and   
 only a small playground. The children 
 are taken to swimming baths in Thirsk 
 once a week, parents providing the    
 transport.                            
 Toilets are outside and there is very 
 little in the way of washing          
 facilities.                           
 School dinners for 21 children are    
 cooked on the premises the remainder  
 of the children bring packed lunch.   
 In 1985 there are 22 children from    
 Sutton itself the remaining 21 come   
 from the nearby villages of Bagby,    
 Boltby,Felixkirk,Kilburn and Thirlby. </content>
