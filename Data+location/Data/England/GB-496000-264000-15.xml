		<content>  Rushden &amp; Higham Rugby Club rent     
their ground from the council. The club
has been in existance for 35 years,    
their ground and clubhouse being sited 
just off the Bedford Rd.               
  The committee which runs the club    
consists of 18 members. They have three
sections for the players: senior; colts
and mini-rugby section. They enter many
cup competitions the highest being the 
Burt White Shield.                     
  The players train at their own club  
grounds, but sometimes they have to    
share their field with an archery club 
from Raunds or dog training classes.   
They do have some drainage problems as 
the main pitch gets very wet and muddy.
The club has a treatment room, practice
pitch and changing rooms.              
  Another growing sport in our Â£D'     
Block is that of Â£Micro-Light' flying. 
The pilots use a field along Newton Rd.</content>
