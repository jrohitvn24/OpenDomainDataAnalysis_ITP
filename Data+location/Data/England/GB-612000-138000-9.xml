      The most serious matter for most 
 in this district is the lack of public
 transport and the isolation of the    
 scattered communities. This is        
 intensified in Stowting and the north 
 of Stanford, the former being         
 accessible only through long narrow   
 winding lanes and the latter being a  
 village literally cut in half by the  
 M2O Motorway with no adequate link for
 old and young people or cars between  
 the two halves. The fast speed of     
 traffic on the lanes, especially of   
 heavy lorries &amp; commercial vans is    
 also of concern. The opinion of most  
 people about the Channel Tunnel link  
 with Europe is that although the      
 affect upon this area has not been    
 made clear,the decision has already   
 been taken about the route of the M2O 
 extension and the exit of the Tunnel. </content>
