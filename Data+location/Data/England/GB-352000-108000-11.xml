		<title>11Pendomer</title>
		<content> Pendomer is a hamlet of only about 8  
 dwellings and the church. Except for  
 one new bungalow, and some new farm   
 buildings, all the houses are old and 
 there seems little likelihood of any  
 more development. The one road leading
 to the village is narrow and winding, 
 and goes nowhere else; the land is all
 intensively farmed. The former Manor  
 House, though altered and reduced in  
 size, is still a handsome building.   
 The Old School House, which once      
 accommodated both the school and the  
 teacher, has been a dwelling for some 
 years. The children of Pendomer are   
 now taken by bus to primary school in 
 East Coker, or secondary school in    
 Yeovil. Nevertheless this is a lively 
 and pleasant place to live in, with a 
 travelling library, a WI shared with  
 Hardington Mandeville &amp; the facilities
 of Yeovil only about 5 miles away.    </content>
