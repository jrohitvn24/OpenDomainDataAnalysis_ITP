		<content>  All the children of class 4 and      
 class 5,aged between 7 and 9,took part
 in the Domesday Project between May   
 and July 1985.It was the major work of
 the summer term.The children,a group  
 of 60,were taken on 2 walks around the
 area.The first around the coast the   
 second over the hills.They then       
 divided into interest groups for the  
 study.The parents came to a meeting   
 and the project was described,many    
 offered to help.The groups planned    
 their own field work and invited      
 parents to go with them,other parents 
 became familiar with the computer and 
 helped the children type in their     
 work,95%of the work was done by the   
 children.At the end of the project    
 invited their parents and all those   
 that had helped to an exhibition of   
 work.{All enjoyed the Project,we have 
{all learned much. }                   </content>
