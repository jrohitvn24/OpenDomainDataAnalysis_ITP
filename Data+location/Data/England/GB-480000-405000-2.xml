		<content> OUR SQUARE IS COVERED BY ARABLE       
 FARMLAND AND IS LOW LYING AND FLAT.   
 THE RIVER TRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE     
 SQUARE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH AND THE    
 HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE NATURE OF THE SOIL  
 OWES MUCH TO THE SILT LEFT BY THE     
 RIVER.  NOW THE RIVER IS CONTAINED    
 BEHIND A HIGH BANK AND FLOODING IS NO 
 LONGER A PROBLEM.  THE CUSTOM OF      
 WARPING (ALLOWING THE RIVER TO FLOOD  
 AND LEAVE DEPOSITS OF RICH MUD) IS NO 
 LONGER PRACTISED.  THERE ARE FOUR     
 SETTLEMENTS IN THE AREA;  WEST        
 BUTTERWICK WITH A POPULATION OF 680;  
 EAST BUTTERWICK AND BELTOFT WITH ABOUT
 150 EACH AND OUTMILL WITH AROUND 20.  
 THERE ARE SOME ISOLATED FARMS AND A   
 FEW SMALL AREAS OF WOODLAND.  THE     
 SQUARE IS CROSSED BY TWO NATURAL GAS  
 PIPES AND ELECTRICITY SUPPLY LINES ON 
 PYLONS.  THE AREA IS COVERED BY       
 NUMEROUS DRAINS AND DYKES.            </content>
