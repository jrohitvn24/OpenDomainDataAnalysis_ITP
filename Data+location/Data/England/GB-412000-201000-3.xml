 comprehensive school providing        
 secondary education for all children  
 between ll and l8 years of age.  Its  
 catchment area includes the larger    
 settlements of Fairford and Lechlade

 is taught and in recent years new     
 subjects such as computer studies and 
 technology have found a place in the  
 curriculum.  Music, drama, art and    
 sport play a significant part in      
 school life.  Each year in July normal
 lessons are suspended for an          
 Activities Week when residential      
 courses both at home and abroad as    
 well as school based ones are arranged
 There is an annual French Exchange.   
 In the summer term next September's   
 intake is invited to spend an         
 introductory day at the school.       </content>
