		<title>15CORPORATION WASTE DISPOSAL</title>
		<content> Situated in Abbey Lane, the layout    
 includes: weighbridge, stores,        
 materials lab, waste recycling and    
 environmental/health units. The       
 corporation tip takes in 1100 tons of 
 domestic refuse per week from 135,000 
 household bins. Additionally, 3 civic 
 dumping areas (where residents dump   
 their own refuse) collect 43,500 tons 
 of rubbish. There are also Bulk       
 Collections (settees, fridges, etc.)  
 which accumulate 14,500 tons of       
 refuse. Trade waste is collected at   
 the rate of 300 tons a week. The task 
 of keeping Leicester clean is a       
 mammoth one and one of the greatest   
 innovations has been in recycling     
 waste products-the bottle bank alone  
 has returned 2.5 tons of material to  
 the glass industry. 26 dustcarts serve
 the entire city.
