		<content> On a{school day}I have to get up at   
{7:30.}My mum gets up at 6:30 but my   
 sister and my dad get up around the   
 same time as me. For breakfast I      
 usually have toast or cornflakes.My   
 mum gets up so early because she has  
 to go and do a few jobs at the farm.{I
{arrive at school at 8:30.}When I go   
 into the playground if my friends are 
 there I go to meet them.{My favourite 
{lessons at school are games and art. I
{travel to school by car}and my mum or 
 dad comes to pick up my sister and me 
 after school to take us home.         
{At the weekend I go riding}at a local 
 stables, on a chestnut horse called   
 Flicka or a pony called Lancelot.     
 Sometimes{I go riding through the     
{woods near my home.}I enjoy this very 
 much.
