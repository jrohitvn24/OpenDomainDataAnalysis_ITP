		<content> The Vicar showed us the newer parts of
 the church.{The North Transept}was the
 gift of the{Hollist}family just before
 1840.  The {South  Transept }with  its
 Norman  window  copied  from  Shoreham
 Church  was built by the {Dennetts }in
 1841  and is now a  children's  chapel
 dedicated to{St Nicholas.}We liked the
 bright windows. It was a very peaceful
 place. It was very quiet even with all
 of us in the nave. We said our prayers
 then  walked  around with our friends.
 The {St Nicholas  window }in the{South
{Porch}is lovely and chunky and full of
 colour.                               
     Outside,we walked around the tombs
 and gravestones.    We went to the new
 graveyard  and found {Ernest Shepard's
 gravestone.    Mr.Shepard's   pictures
 make{  A.A.Milne's  "Winnie the Pooh" 
 stories much more interesting.        
    We really enjoyed our visit.       </content>
