		<title>13A SATURDAY IN NORTH CAVE</title>
		<content>    Brriiinng, Brriiinng, "Oh, 8.00,I'd
 better get up.  I wonder what's for   
 breakfast - probably grapefruit or a  
 sandwich as usual.  I've just got to  
 get dressed, washed and comb my hair. 
 Phew!  All ready.  I'd better go and  
 feed the guinea pigs.  Oh dear!       
 What's wrong with Patch - it looks to 
 me as if she's not very well.  Some of
 her fur's dropped out.  It could just 
 be fleas but it might not be.  I'd    
 better arrange to get her to the vet. 
 "Come on you two, I've got to go to   
 the shops," Mum called.   Oh well,we'd
 better take the ponies to the field   
 and then I can finish that doll's     
 dress I was making for Caroline.      
 9.00 p.m. I hope Mum doesn't notice   
 the time.  "Come on, off to bed you   
 lot".  Pity, she did notice!
