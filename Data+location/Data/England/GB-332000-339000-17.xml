		<content> This church was built in 1861.There is
 evidence of 3 older buildings which go
 back over 1000 years.The present      
 church is built of red sandstone and  
 is sited on the banks of the River    
 Dee.There can be few village churches 
 with a more picturesque setting.Built 
 in a{Decorated }style, the ground plan
 shows a Nave, North and South Aisles  
 of 3 bays and a polygonal aspidal     
 Chancery.                             
 Sunday services are held at 10.15 am  
 and a Sunday School at 11.30 am, and a
 third service is held at 6.30 pm once 
 a month.                              
 People from Overton,Knolton Bryn,     
 Penley and Erbistock get together for 
 an evening service once a month.      
 The original dedication was to St     
 Erbin, a nineth century Celtic Saint, 
 and later changed, probably by the    
 Normans, to St Hilary.                </content>
