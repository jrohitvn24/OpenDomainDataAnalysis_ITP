		<content> On Friday,10th May,a group of children
 did a survey at Kingsway Park,        
 sometimes known as the "Acre".Two     
 children measured the perimeter of    
 the park (about 1000 metres) whilst   
 the other four and the teacher        
 interviewed some park workers.There   
 are many activities for young and old 
 such as                               
 football,bowling,tennis,putting and   
 cricket.There are cricket and bowling 
 matches every Saturday in summer.     
 There is an aviary with beautiful     
 birds.There is also a rose garden.    
 At the top of the park is a children's
 playground with swings,climbing frame,
 rocket,seesaw,hanging ropes and round-
 about.                                
 The park is maintained by the local   
 council.
