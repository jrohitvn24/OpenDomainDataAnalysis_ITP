		<content>   There are no public buildings in    
 this area:pub, church and village     
 hall are all down in the village.We   
 have only farms,with the occasional   
 cottage or bungalow.The latter are of 
 fairly recent construction and their  
 masonry-painted walls and             
 composition-tiled roofs have not yet  
 harmonised with the landscape.        
   The old farm-houses are built of    
 rough stone,with thick walls and wide 
 ingle-nook fireplaces. Their rooms are
 often on different levels,because of  
 the sloping nature of the site(always 
 well chosen,sheltered,near a spring   
 and enjoying lovely views).Many still 
 have thatched roofs,though others have
 had them replaced by slates.All but   
 the very smallest farms have a double 
 set of buidings,the modern concrete   
 silos,sheds and milking-parlours      
 sitting next to the older outhouses.  </content>
