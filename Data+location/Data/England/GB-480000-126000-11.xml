		<content>                                       
 liphook station on the main railway   
 line from london to portsmouth must be
 the focus of transport as many        
 residents work in london, guildford or
 portsmouth using the railway to       
 commute. to get to the station people 
 use their private cars, and cars are  
 the main means of transport in the    
 area for shopping, visiting, etc.     
 there is a very scanty bus service    
 between midhurst and petersfield      
 passing through the area and a daily  
 bus run by the education department   
 picking up the school children for    
 midhurst intermediate and grammar     
 schools. the one trunk road in the    
 area is the london to portsmouth(A3)  
 which carries much heavy traffic; all 
 the other roads are minor, some no    
 more than lanes. there is a taxi      
 service.                              </content>
