		<title>14EARL STERNDALE CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Last summer the carnival was revived  
 after a few years without one.It is   
 small, but our Queen's float enters   
 Buxton Carnival.                      
   First they judge the competitions,  
 crown the Carnival Queen and award the
 prizes.Next the parade tours the      
 village, ending in the recreation     
 ground, where sports are held.Teas are
 served in our school.There are stalls 
 in the school yard.There was a mini   
 marathon round the village,followed by
 a football match.Then later there was 
 a barbecue which was good.
