   Today (1985) people wear the most   
 odd things. Most teenagers of today   
 like to wear up to date clothes. The  
 most fashionable colours are red,     
 black and white. Ski-pants are back in
 fashion the last time being in the    
 '6os. They are like horse-riders      
 trousers but are black. People today  
 wear long skirts or mini-skirts.      
   Hair styles have also changed. Boys 
 have their hair spiked or dyed. Some  
 even have no hair at all! Girls tend  
 to have long hair. Some have their    
 hair short or permed.                 
   Shoes of today tend to be high or   
 have no heels at all. Shoes of today  
 are adventurous.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
