		<content>                                       
    Many of the inhabitants of         
 Ossington grow their own{vegetables,  
 in order to have{fresh foods}every    
 day, also to store in their{freezer   
 for future use when they are out of   
 season.                               
    As the nearest market town for     
{shopping}is{Newark}which is           
 approximately nine miles away, many   
 people rely on the{mobile butcher}and 
{vegetable retailer.                   
    Milk, newspapers and magazines are 
 delivered daily, and a{mobile library 
 visits the village and surrounding    
 community once a fortnight.
