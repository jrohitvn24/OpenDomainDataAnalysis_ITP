		<content>  Our block contains a wide variety of 
 housing styles and prices. Three      
 quarters of the housing stock date    
 from the mid-fifties when green belt  
 and farming land was eaten away by new
 estates needed to house the growing   
 population of Nottingham.             
  Chilwell, Bramcote and Beeston are   
 rated highly and there are many       
 detached properties which command a   
 high price.                           
  Stapleford has some large Victorian  
 houses but there are many traditional 
 terraced and town houses toward the   
 town centre.                          
  The Council have built and rent out  
 many houses in Chilwell and           
 Stapleford.
