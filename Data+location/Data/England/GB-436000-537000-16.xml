		<title>16Thornley - Housing</title>
		<content>    The original{housing}in Thornley   
{dates from}the{sinking of the mine    
 shaft. Housing was provided for those 
 who worked in the mine.               
    Later as the{village expanded,     
{council houses were erected}to provide
 homes for the{increased population.   
{Private houses}formed a very{small    
{proportion}of the total housing in the
 village.                              
    After the{mine closed}in the 1960's
 the population declined and many      
{families moved away}in search of work.
 The{colliery houses}were in need of   
{renovation}or{demolition.}A large     
 proportion were demolished leaving    
 large ares of the village{open for    
{rebuilding and development.           
    Because of{poor employment         
{possibilities}in the area the need for
 extra housing was not urgent. The{open
{areas remain open.                    </content>
