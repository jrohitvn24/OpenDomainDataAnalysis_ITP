		<title>02The George Inn:the Deverills</title>
		<content>{ The George}stands at the crossroads  
 in{Longbridge Deverill}village. It is 
 a very attractive building,white      
 washed stone with a pantile roof. It  
 has a lovely inn sign showing King    
 George the Third.                     
 Many years ago it was a farm believed 
 to be mentioned in the{Domesday       
{Book.}There is documentary evidence   
 from the 12th century that{Thomas a   
{Becket}stayed at the Inn when he      
 visited Longbridge Deverill to        
 consecrate the church.                
 Today it is a very busy Inn, serving  
 many motorists on their way along the 
 A35O to the beach. The innkeepers     
 came to the Inn in 198O. They did not 
 make any alterations, they liked the  
 atmosphere of the small cosy bars.    
 Seven people work here in the busy    
 summer season and many village        
 activities centre on the Inn.         </content>
