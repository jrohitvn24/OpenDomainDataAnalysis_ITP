		<content> Andrew Swan and I often go to the back
 of Mapperley Hospital on the fottball 
 pitch. I've played football, watched  
 football and enjoyed football all my  
 life. My Dad used to and still does   
 coach me everyday. I like to play     
 football for myself but I also like to
 watch Notts County when they're       
 playing at home, I also like to watch 
 football on T.V. I've got all the     
 dress for football, football boots,   
 socks, shorts, gloves, shirts,        
 trainers, tracksuit and of course a   
 football. I play for school,          
 Nottingham and Boy's Brigade. The     
 season has now finished so I'll be    
 playing for fun. My Dad's work often  
 play football matchs (as fun between  
 staff and workers) where I'm asked to 
 play. I would like to eventually play 
 for Notts County or Liverpool.
