		<title>05Fruit growing near Kexby.</title>
		<content> My aunty owns an orchard near the     
 Lincolnshire village of Kexby.I help  
 her out when the weather is fine.I    
 live in Gainsborough and have to cycle
 to get to her orchard.                
 She picks the apples by placing a     
{vibrator}around the base of the       
 tree.When this is switched on most    
 of the apples fall off the tree and   
 are collected on a cloth on the       
 ground.                               
 I climb up a ladder to pick the apples
 that do not fall off the tree.The     
 apples then go on a conveyor belt to  
 be sorted out into their different    
 sizes.                                
 My aunt also keeps chickens and       
 turkeys.The turkeys are given speciial
 food to fatten them up for{Christmas. 
 She sells all the fruit and the birds 
 to shops in Gainsborough.
