		<content>On Wednesday the 3rd of July we had    
sports day in the village. We had it on
the Village Green because our grassy   
area was too wet. We all carried the   
equipment down to the Green. We started
at 1.30pm. and stopped at 3.00pm. It   
was so hot that we thought it was the  
hottest day of the year. We had teams  
because everyone can't really win. We  
all wore clothes with our team colours 
or a coloured band.                    
The teams were the Red Hats,Yellow Hats
and Blue Hats. Our events were the egg 
and spoon race, the sack race, skipping
relays and sprints. We ran to win. If  
you won you got a purple ribbon and a  
red ribbon for being second. The Red   
Hats won with 33 points. Yellow Hats   
had 26 points and Blue Hats 24. The    
village Postmistress gave us all some  
sweets. We enjoyed the day very much.
