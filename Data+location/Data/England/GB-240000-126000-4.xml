		<content> In many  ways Abbotsham is the ideal  
 village. It has a church, a chapel,   
 a school, a pub, a post office and    
 general stores.  New housing has      
 recently enlarged,without  drastically
 changing,the centre of the village and
 is pleasant to look at.               
 Most people questioned are very       
 satisfied: "Abbotsham is a lovely     
 place to live in" being the most      
 frequent answer.                      
 By the efforts of  parishioners, a    
 playing  field with a hard tarmac     
 surface, is open all the year. Close  
 by stands the Parish Hall administered
 by trustees. It has recently attracted
 a grant from the Community Council of 
 Devon. It is in regular use by the    
 Play group, the  Women's Institute,   
 Old time dancing, Skittles and a Youth
 club.
