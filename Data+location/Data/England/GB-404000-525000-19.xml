		<content>  We have a{mobile library}and a{school
 library. The nearest{public libraries 
 are in Barnard Castle - 7 miles away  
 and Bishop Auckland - 10 miles away.  
 You can also borrow records at these  
 libraries.                            
  The{mobile library}calls every       
 fortnight but it can be affected by   
 public holidays and bad weather. There
 are story books and non-fiction books.
 It is a good service for older people.
 Mobile libraries only come out into   
 the country districts. Old people     
 do not have to go into town and get   
 books.                                
  Bigger schools like{Secondory Schools
 generally have big libraries. There   
 is a lot of information in{our school 
{library}as well as story books.The    
 most popular books in our library are 
 about dinosaurs and wildlife.
