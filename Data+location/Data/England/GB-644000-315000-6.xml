		<content> The Broadlands are to me very         
 peaceful with the reeds and rushes    
 rustling in the wind and the          
 occasional cry of geese and ducks.The 
 water is sparkling in the sunlight and
 the coots paddling across the water   
 with the graceful swans swimming      
 alongside the odd fisherman fishing   
 for a catch. The wide expanse of water
 holds many things,with the trees      
 moving around its banks.              
 The webbed feet of the coot go up the 
 bank making prints into the soft mud. 
 The seagulls swoop on the fish that   
 are near the surface feeding on the   
 insect life that falls in the         
 river.The swans glide up the river    
 with their heads high in the air like 
 upperclass people.Sometimes boats come
 up and down the river with holiday    
 makers coming for a peaceful weekend.
