		<title>12BROMYARD FIRE SERVICE</title>
		<content>    By 1940, the{Bromyard Fire Service 
 was fully equipped and very efficient.
 In 1941, the Brigade was taken over by
 the Government and travelled all over 
 the country helping war_torn cities.  
 The Bromyard Brigade was rated second 
 in the county in 1942.                
    The service covers an area between 
{Upper Sapey}and{Whitbourne.}There are 
 only two full_time firemen at the     
 station in{New Road}which was opened  
 in 1961 at cost of{Â£7,500}after the   
 old Newbold premises had almost       
 collapsed.                            
    The station is fully equipped to   
 deal with all fire_related            
 emergencies. Water has been carried   
 when the local supply has failed.     
 Among other unusual duties tackled in 
 this rural community, cows have been  
 rescued from ponds.
