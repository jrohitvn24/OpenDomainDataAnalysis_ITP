 Reverend Wolfenden was ordained in    
1946. He has been working in Geddington
for 22 years and enjoys his job.       
In the morning the Vicar gets up at    
6.00am and has his breakfast at 8.00am.
He visits people in the village, talks 
to the schoolchildren and takes all the
services in the Church.                
The Vicar would like the Church to have
a new vestry. He would also like to see
a bigger congregation.
