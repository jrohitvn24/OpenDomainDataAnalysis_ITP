		<title>11West Stour-The Ship Inn</title>
		<content> Domesday Book mentions two settlements
 West Stour and Little Kington.The     
 latter remained a small hamlet but the
 other developed into a village with   
 open fields to the south-west,enclosed
 in 1779.One of Manor Farm barns is    
 dated 1793 while the Ship Inn next    
 door has its first recorded innkeeper 
 in 1714.It was a coaching inn where   
 horses were changed for the pull up to
 Shaftesbury.As coaches and carts gave 
 way to cars and charabancs,the inn    
 keeper replaced the stables with a    
 garage and petrol pump.Here the coach 
 waited for excited children for the   
 Sunday School outing to Weymouth,and  
 here too present day children board   
 their buses for primary and secondary 
 schools.In due course a postbox was   
 built into a stone pillar there and in
 1963 a telephone box appeared.
