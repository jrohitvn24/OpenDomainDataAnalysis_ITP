		<title>03One Sunday in Leicester</title>
		<content> Having woken up at 6.30 my brother and
 I went downstairs.I lit the gas fire  
 and played some games. When Mum came  
 down we had breakfast with my sister  
 and my Dad. It was raining slightly.  
 After reading my library book, I did  
 some ironing until dinner. Pauline, my
 schoolfriend, visited so we could do  
 homework together.                    
 In the afternoon Nan came down from   
 her flat on the next estate for a     
 special tea, as it was my elder       
 sister's birthday the previous day. My
 sister stayed in the front room whilst
 we prepared the tea we had bought for 
 her.We had{salmon sandwiches,ice-cream
 and{strawberries,}and a{birthday cake.
 We couldn't have {pork sandwiches}as  
 some children may have done. We can't 
 eat anything to do with pigs, as that 
 is against our{Muslim}religion.       
 Afterwards Nan went home on the bus.  </content>
