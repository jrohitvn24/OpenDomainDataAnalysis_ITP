		<content>                                       
                                       
  The Policeman,who is responsible for 
 Mundon and Purleigh told us that it   
 was his job to protect life and       
 property and advise people about      
 security and safety .                 
   He chose to become a policeman      
 because he never knows what he will be
 doing from day to day,and he meets    
 many different people.                
   He covers his rural area in a squad 
 car,which is a Ford Escort.           
   He recently became involved in the  
 Miners strike,and spent many hours in 
 Nottingham,he didn't like this very   
 much.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
