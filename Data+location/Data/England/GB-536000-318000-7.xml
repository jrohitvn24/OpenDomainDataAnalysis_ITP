 Although the village is not very      
 large, we have quite a lot of shopping
 facilities. There is a general store  
 which sells almost everything you can 
 think of, including groceries,        
 greengrocery, hardware, some clothing,
 and alcohol. If what you need is not  
 there, the owner will order it for    
 you.We also have a butcher who sells  
 tins and packets as well as           
 meat.Children can buy crisps there.   
 The Post Office is small and sells    
 stationery and some craft items. You  
 have to go to Holbeach or Long Sutton 
 if you want something important like  
 road tax.                             
 We also have a garage, a pub, a       
 hairdresser, and two chip vans call   
 twice a week and park on the village  
 green.For more important things you   
 have to go to Wisbech or Peterborough.</content>
