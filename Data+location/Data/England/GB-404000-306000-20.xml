		<content>  Burntwood has a number of shopping   
centres.Chasetown High Street was the  
original mining village centre and it  
retains the character of that era.     
Sankey's Corner (SK045094)is more      
central to the expanded modern town and
has been named Burntwood Town Shopping 
Centre;despite this and its modern     
shops many locals prefer the older High
Street.Other centres include:Swan      
Island on the site of the earliest     
hamlet of Burntwood;and three purpose  
built neighbourhood shopping centres   
with six or so shops each.There are    
also a number of single or grouped     
"corner shops".Hammerwich village has  
one General Store/sub-post office.     
  Despite its size Burntwood has few   
higher order shops:no chain stores or  
department stores.People travel to     
other centres nearby where the weekly  
markets attract many customers.        </content>
