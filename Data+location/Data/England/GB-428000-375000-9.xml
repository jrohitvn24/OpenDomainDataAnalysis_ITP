		<title>09THE BARLOW HUNT</title>
		<content> The Barlow Hunt was formed and{hunts} 
 in our area between{September}and{    
{March}meeting every Tuesday and       
 Thursday.The hunt consists of 60 pure 
 bred foxhounds and is led by the      
 master and the huntsman.The young     
 foxhounds are bred and reared at{     
{Horsleygate Hall Kennels}.The hounds  
 are fed mainly on dead animals which  
 are collected from the moors and mixed
 cereal.The hounds drink fresh spring  
 water from the local hillside.To      
 prevent them from worring the sheep   
 while hunting,the young hounds of 1   
 year in age are placed in pens to     
 accustom them to sheep.The hunt was   
 formed in 1878 and since that time has
 had 3 masters from the same family.The
 hunt avoids damaging farmers crops and
 property and frighting the fox away   
 from farmers poultry.The ages of the  
 hunting foxhounds ranges from 2 to 7. </content>
