		<title>08THE STANWAY-TOLLGATE AREA</title>
		<content>  At the edge of{Stanway}was a         
{roundabout}leading to the A12 with a  
 few cottages and fields near it.      
 Builders bought the land and put      
{houses}of brick,slate,plaster and wood
 on it - all different and not in rows.
  About one thousand people found homes
 here. Nearby exhausted gravel pits and
 fields were bought.{Bulldozers        
 landscaped the area sheltering sites  
 for factories. Trees were planted and 
 a{community centre}opened. The        
 buildings were designed in glass,steel
 and brick. Local people began to trade
 in children's clothes,gifts and       
 joinery.                              
  There are plans for larger units.    
 Sainsbury's are to build a{large store
 relieving traffic problems at their   
 present site. In a few short years,   
{Stanway}has been enlarged quite a lot.
