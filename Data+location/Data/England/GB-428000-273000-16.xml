		<content>The most popular car colour, we found  
was blue. Red, the country's most      
popular colour, was only our second    
most popular. Most trucks and goods    
vehicles were white. The least popular 
colour was orange. On the bypass there 
were about 207 men and only 47 women   
drivers. The men were probably         
travelling between work. All the vans, 
minibuses and lorries that we saw were 
driven by male drivers.We saw a lot of 
old people. At Gibbet Hill there were  
172 men and 54 women, a lot of them    
driving old cars. Most of the cars in  
poor condition were heading for the    
University. They were probably         
students' cars. We found that a lot of 
the cars were going to the University  
or to Coventry. Out of 278 cars on the 
bypass 62 were 'B' registration.
