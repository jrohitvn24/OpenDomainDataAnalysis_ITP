		<content> At weekends we do not have to go to   
 school. On Saturdays and Sundays we   
 can go out with our family and        
 friends. We can go swimming or skating
 in Saffron Walden.  We can have       
 picnics or go to sports days. Once a  
 year we help at the School Sale. We   
 have games in the playground on Sale  
 days. Sometimes we can go to London or
 perhaps to camp. It is fun staying in 
 tents for the weekend. We can go to   
 visit our Nannas or Grandads, or go to
 barbecues. Sometimes we can stay up   
 very late and then on Sundays we are  
 tired! On Sundays we can go to Church 
 or perhaps our family goes fishing.   
 When we go we set up 3 rods. Usually I
 catch the most fish. Once I went      
 strawberry picking. If it is raining  
 we can play with the computer or watch
 the television. Sometimes we get bored
 if it rains at weekends.              </content>
