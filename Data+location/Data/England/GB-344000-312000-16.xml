		<title>16CORNER FARM, BICTON HEATH.</title>
		<content> Corner Farm is part of the Onslow     
 Estate. A tenant farmer and his son   
 work there. They have a herd of 85    
 friesian cows for milking.            
 In Autumn they sow wheat and barley   
 and in Spring they spray these crops  
 with fertilisers and insecticides.    
 In 1986 the new Shrewsbury By-Pass    
 will go through Corner Farm so the    
 farmer wants a bridge built over it so
 that he can take his cows and his     
 tractors to all his fields.           
 Corner Farm used to have 210 acres of 
 land but they had to sell 10 acres for
 part of a big housing estate called   
 Gains Park. A preservation order has  
 been put on a pool on this estate     
 because a number of great crested     
 newts have been discovered there. This
 newt is becoming an endangered        
 species.
