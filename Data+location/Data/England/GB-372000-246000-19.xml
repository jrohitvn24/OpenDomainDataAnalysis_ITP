		<title>19A CAPTAIN LIVING IN CRADLEY</title>
		<content> Many people who live in Cradley travel
 the world to carry out their work; one
 resident is Captain of a cargo ship.He
 loves Cradley and would never leave   
 but he only spends one third of his   
 time here.The rest he is away at sea. 
 His voyage starts at Liverpool where  
 his first job is to check everything  
 on the boat.He asks the engineer about
 the engine.Then there is the oil-is   
 there enough in the tank for the      
 journey? Next he looks at the cargo to
 see it is packed properly because it  
 is coming up to hurricane season.Then 
 he checks the navigation and lastly he
 checks the crew to see that everybody 
 is there.When they set sail they go to
 the West Indies by crossing the       
 Atlantic.After they have unloaded they
 go up the River Amazon to load 3,000  
 tons of plywood and Brazil nuts and   
 mahogany wood.                        </content>
