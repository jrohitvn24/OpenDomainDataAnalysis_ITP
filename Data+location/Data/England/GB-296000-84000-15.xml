Diana,Princess of Wales visited the    
Royal Marine Training Camp at Lympstone
today,luckily one of the few fine days 
of this cool and wet summer.She arrived
by helicopter before lunch and was     
shown by the Commandment.Security was  
tight, police helicopters kept a       
constant watch.After meeting staff and 
their families for lunch,she watched   
Physical Training displays.The main    
purpose of her visit was to meet the   
young recruits and their parents.Then  
she was flown to Woodbury Common to    
see Marines in action.The visit was    
kept as informal as possible but alot  
of work went into the preparation.     
Princes Andrew and Edward both trained 
at this camp.
