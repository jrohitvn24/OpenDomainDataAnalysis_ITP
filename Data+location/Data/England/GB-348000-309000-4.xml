		<content> Most people{(55%)}go out as a family  
 regularly but many go alone sometimes.
 In{91%}of families there are 2 adults 
 and most have 2 children.{Half}the    
 families have 4 people in. Nearly all 
 the people in this area do not have   
 relatives living with them. Thus old  
 people tend to live in homes or       
 old peoples' bungalows. Nearly all the
 people go on holiday as a family.     
 People feel we are a fairly close     
 neighbourhood and most parents{(90%)} 
 make sure there is a person at home   
 when their children come in from      
 school. Nearly all the people do not  
 have lodgers nor do many people visit 
 here. We are very friendly with our   
 neighbours and we get on well. Most of
 us are content with our living        
 accomodation. Most people read and    
 watch T.V. We are not much behind in  
 home technology, if we can afford it. </content>
