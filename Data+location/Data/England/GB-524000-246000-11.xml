		<content>     Wrestlingworth was not mentioned  
 in the origional Domesday Survey. The 
 earliest written record in 1150 gives 
 its spelling as "Wraslingewrd". This  
 meant "the enclosure belonging to     
 Wraestel". By 1234 the village was    
 known as Wrestlingworth. In the early 
 13th century there were two manors.   
 One was first mentioned in 1138-84    
 when Simon, Earl of Northampton and   
 Huntingdon, granted the manor of      
 Wrestlingworth to Reginald de         
 Dammartin, Count of Boulogne. Henry   
 VII gave it to his mother in 1485. On 
 her death it passed to Henry VIII. In 
 1722 Sir George Downing owned the     
 manor and by the next century part of 
 the village was owned by Downing      
 College.
