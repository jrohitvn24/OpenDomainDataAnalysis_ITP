		<title>06My home in Wombourne</title>
		<content> I live in an 8 year old detached house
on the edge of the Poolhouse estate. My
home has  4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a
downstairs  toilet, a lounge, a  dining
room,a small study and a large kitchen.
 I spend some of my  spare time in  the
lounge  watching television or a video.
Sometimes I listen to music on the hifi
or play the piano in the study. We also
keep our Spectrum computer there.      
 In the kitchen we have a dryer,fridge,
washing machine, cooker  and  microwave
oven. At breakfast  time we eat in  the
kitchen but have our other meals in the
dining room.                           
 My bedroom is upstairs,next to Mum and
Dad's and my sister's.The other bedroom
is a spare  room. My room was decorated
recently in pink. I have a bed which is
different.The top part lifts up to give
storage  space for toys. It is  an easy
bed to make.I have a continental quilt.</content>
