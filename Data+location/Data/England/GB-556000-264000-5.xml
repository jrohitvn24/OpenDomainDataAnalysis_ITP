		<title>05ST.MARY'S CHURCH BURWELL.</title>
		<content> Though it has a{Norman tower},the     
 Parish Church is{a fine example of the
{Perpendicular}style.It has 12 pillars 
 supporting the roof.There are 8 bells 
 on big wooden wheels.The nave is red- 
 carpeted and there are two altars.(The
 smaller is for Wednesday Communion. ) 
 Unlike most churches the organ is at  
 the back and the organist goes up on a
 high balcony. The Vicar can  use a    
 microphone linked to two speakers on  
 pillars.                              
{Reverend Secrett}has been in Burwell  
 for 10 years.He holds regular services
 on Sundays and Wednesdays using the   
 Alternative Service Book 1980 with    
 Hymns Ancient And Modern.There may be 
 as many as 110 in the Sunday morning  
 congregation including a{Sunday School
 of 50 children.                       
 A{Flaming Heart Tombstone}in the yard 
 recalls an 18th C.barn-fire tragedy.  </content>
