		<title>06JANE AUSTEN'S HOUSE</title>
		<content> Jane Austen came to Chawton in        
 1809.During the next few years her    
 most famous novels were written and   
 published. The house probably dates   
 back to the reign of William          
 3rd.,originally being a posting inn   
 and alehouse. Slight modifications and
 an extension have been made of the    
 years. Today the house is a tourist   
 attraction. Just outside the boundary 
 wall is a speciall preserved oak tree 
 planted in or about 1809. Every July  
 the world-wide Jane Austen Society    
 holds a day-long meeting in a marquee 
 on the lawns of Chawton House.
