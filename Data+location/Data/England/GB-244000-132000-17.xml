		<title>17Crow Point</title>
		<content> On Octber 26th 1984,- the neck of land
 known as{Crow Point}was partly washed 
 away. There is a difference of opinion
 as to why this happened. Some local   
 people say it was because of gravel   
 extraction others believe it was due  
 to natural forces. Braunton           
 Conservation Project received a grant 
 to rebuild the point. Tonnes and      
 tonnes of concrete blocks and sand    
 have been shifted by J.C.B's and      
 bulldozers to bridge the gap caused by
 the surge tide.                       
   When we visited the point Mr Harding
 explained how volunteers and Manpower 
 Services Commission would plant marram
 grass to cover the repaired area. The 
 marram grass should eventually bind   
 the sand together and the point will  
 again blend in with the surrounding   
 scenery.
