		<title>15THE MINERS' STRIKE</title>
		<content>  The president of the NATIONAL UNION  
 OF MINEWORKERS decided that all the   
 mining industry should come out on    
 strike.After about two to three weeks 
 the women's action group began to cook
 dinners for miners,miner's wives and  
 children.Many miners had to give up   
 their houses and sell some of their   
 goods and some found it hard to buy   
 food.                                 
  Everyday on the News it was all about
 the strike.The NCB organised meetings 
 which didn't work.About three to four 
 months later some miners began to go  
 back to work and this caused a lot of 
 violence even in Bentley.It was in all
 the papers.There were marches taking  
 place in all areas.
