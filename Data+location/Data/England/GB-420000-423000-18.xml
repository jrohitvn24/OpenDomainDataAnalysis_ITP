		<title>18AN ASIAN CHILD'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content> My  Name is  Nassir Mahmood. I live at
 45, Upper George  Street.  On Sunday I
 get   up  at  9.30  a.m.  I  have   my
 breakfast  at  9.45 a.m. and I  get my
 clothes  on  at 10.00  and  go  to the
 Mosque at 10.10. I  come back from the
 Mosque   at  2.00  p.m.  and  have  my
 dinner. When I have had my dinner I go
 to sleep  and wake up at 3.15. At 3.30
 I go to read  my Prayers, again at the
 Mosque.  When I have  read the  prayer
 then I read  my  Quran. At 8.15 I read
 another Prayer.  When I have  read the
 Prayer I go home  at 8.30 p.m. and eat
 something  and  then  I go back to the
 Mosque  again to  read  another Prayer
 and I  come back home at 9.30 p.m. and
 I go to sleep.
