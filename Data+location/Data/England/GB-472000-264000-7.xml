		<content>   The main concern for Kingsthorpe at 
 the moment is to deal with the problem
 of the high numbers of young and old  
 people.  We are concerned with helping
 the old to get out of their houses if 
 they are on their own.  There are     
 many places which specialise in caring
 for them for example, Help the Aged,  
 Obelisk House.  There are also warden 
 assisted accomadation areas which have
 a number of flats all connected to the
 wardens own flat by a special intercom
 system.  There are also many play     
 groups which deal with young children,
 for example ST Davids, ST Marks Hall  
 and two play groups at Kingsthorpe    
 Upper School.  These are run by       
 parents and specially trained nursery 
 nurses for children between the ages  
 of two and four years old.
