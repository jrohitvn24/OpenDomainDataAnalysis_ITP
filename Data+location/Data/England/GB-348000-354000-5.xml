		<title>05HORSE TRAINER AT HARTHILL</title>
		<content>  We went to interview a local man who 
 is a horse trainer. His  house is     
 a nice little cottage, it has got     
 hills all around it, it is very       
 sheltered, he trains showjumpers,     
 hunters and eventers. He likes  to    
 start breaking or training in         
 September so that the horse would     
 be ready for the spring and the shows.
 He has been riding horses or ponies   
 since  he was eleven years old. He    
 said that people were becoming more   
 interested in horses and ponies       
 because it was all part of the        
 leisure  business.Sometimes he rides  
 for pleasure in the hills. At one     
 time he  had 12 foals, he has got 7   
 horses at the moment.His favourite    
 training is showjumping, he also keeps
 some cows to add to his income.
