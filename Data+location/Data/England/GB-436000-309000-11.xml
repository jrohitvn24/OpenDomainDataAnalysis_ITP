		<content> Heather Sparkenhoe Cricket Club has   
 existed for all of this century,      
 originally playing where Sparkenhoe   
 Estate now stands, and since 1947 on  
 the 'Miners' Welfare' recreation      
 ground, now owned by the Parish       
 Council. The old pavilion has been    
 demolished and replaced by one donated
 by the Coal Board in 1982. The club   
 has a playing strength of over 30,    
 with an age range of 15 - 50, and it  
 contains several well-known village   
 names such as Bradford, Cooper and    
 Grewcock.  The two Saturday teams now 
 play in the Leicestershire Senior     
 League, with clubs mainly from the    
 Western side of the County.  The Club 
 enters two mid-week competitions, the 
 Bardon Cup and the Heather Charity Cup
 (40 and over) which H.S.C.C. organise 
 for the mentally handicapped.
