		<content> In Frant there is a village hall where
 many functions and parties take place.
 There are two main rooms in the       
 hall,one large and one small.In the   
 small room there is a picture of an   
 old lady seated in a rocking chair    
 knitting.People say that she moves and
 rocks to and fro in her chair.        
 They say that she hates               
 children,parties and people enjoying  
 themselves.It's a horrible picture to 
 hang on the wall because most of the  
 things that happen in the hall are for
 enjoyment.                            
 As well as the story of the old lady  
 people also say that the hall is      
 haunted but I don't believe either of 
 these stories.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
