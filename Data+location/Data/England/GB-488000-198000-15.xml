		<title>15 Great Missenden Church</title>
		<content>  The first church was built in 1200 on
 land which belonged to the Abbey next 
 door.The present building dates back  
 to the fourteenth and fifteenth       
 centuries, but half of it was built   
 less than a hundred years ago. The    
 church has quite a few connections    
 with the Civil War:a vicar called     
 Robert Lenthall who was a relation of 
 the Speaker in the House of Commons in
 Cromwell's time,and a Mr.Penn who     
 founded Pennsylvania. There was an    
 artist from the last century called   
 William Kennal.                       
  Most people who worship here now live
 fairly locally.There are three youth  
 clubs,a Wednesday club for 10-12 year 
 olds,A.C.T.on Saturdays for 12-16 year
 olds and S.A.C.T. on Sundays.The      
 Sunday Joint hold a Young People's    
 Service each week after the morning   
 Parish Communion Service.             </content>
