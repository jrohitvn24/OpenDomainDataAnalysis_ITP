		<title>13Singleton Open Air Museum</title>
		<content>   The museum provides a different and 
 enjoyable way of learning about the   
 Past.On its site,it has 40 buildings  
 of historical interest,as well as     
 nature walks,farms and a medieval     
 market.                               
  The museum was formed in 1969,by Roy 
 Armstrong,and is owned by West Dean.  
 All the houses are brought to the site
 in pieces and reassembled in their    
 original condition.As a last resort   
 ,replicas are sometimes used.         
   There is an operational water mill_a
 wind pump is used to circulate the    
 water.                                
   To sustain the museum,Â£250,000,which
 is the average annual income,is needed
 every year.                           
   Some of the buildings have been     
 moved several times,and one was       
 completely destroyed by arson.
