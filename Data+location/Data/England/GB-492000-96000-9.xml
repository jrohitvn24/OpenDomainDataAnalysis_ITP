		<content> The{main shopping areas}are in{Aldwick
{Road}and in the{West Street}area.There
 are no big department stores in this  
 area though these can be found in the 
 town centre. There are ,however,{a    
{variety of small shops.}These include 
 butchers,grocers, greengrocers, health
 foods, sports equipment, newagents,art
 materials ,books and electrical goods.
 There are also many{souvenir shops    
 which cater for the tourist trade.    
 These shops ,mainly situated along the
{Esplanade},are busy in the summertime 
 but not in the winter when many close 
 down.                                 
 In general people were satisfied with 
 the shops that were available .Some   
 people commented that goods tended to 
 be cheaper in the Town centre. The    
 older people said they would have     
 liked to see more personal service as 
 they found it difficult to find items.</content>
