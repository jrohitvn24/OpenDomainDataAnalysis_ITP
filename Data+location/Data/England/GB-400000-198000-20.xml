		<title>20SIDDINGTON'S WILDWOOD PARK</title>
		<content> On a 5 acre field,once a Rugby field, 
 close to Wildwood House 1.5km SE of   
 Cirencester is Wildwood Park which is 
 a residential mobile home site.It was 
 opened in 1966 and now there are 70   
 mobile homes on the site.Many young   
 marrieds live in mobile homes as they 
 are a cheaper first home than a house.
 A typical caravan on this site has a  
 lounge,bathroom,kitchen and 2 bedrooms
 Cooking is by bottled gas and lighting
 by electricity.There are problems when
 you live in a mobile home. They are a 
 good deal smaller than a house so you 
 have to be tidy!They can be very cold 
 in Winter and hot in Summer,rain seeps
 in and condensation,damp and invasions
 by insects are other problems.********
