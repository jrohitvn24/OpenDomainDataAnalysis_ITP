		<content> As with so many country villages,     
 transport can be a problem for those  
 without a car. As the land is flat    
 bicycles are popular with all ages for
 travelling around the village or      
 getting to Headcorn, a reasonable     
 shopping centre. The railway station  
 at Headcorn is popular with people    
 living in the country and commuting to
 London for work. Heavy lorries are a  
 great problem in the country lanes,   
 ploughing up verges and destroying the
 surface of roads not built to bear    
 such weights. The main culprits are 38
 tonne bulk carriers taking sand, etc. 
 also grain carriers and 40' TIR       
 trailers from the continent bringing  
 food etc. to the processing plants at 
 Marley Farm. This is not just a local 
 problem and many parts of the county  
 are suffering from overlarge and      
 overweight vehicles on narrow roads.  </content>
