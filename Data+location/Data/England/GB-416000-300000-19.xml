		<title>19FARMING:DAIRY</title>
		<content>Dairy farming in the area consists of 3
small farms all coming under the       
control of Oak Farm.  One section of   
the farm.  covers 80 acres, mainly used
as pasture for a herd of Fresians, a   
few sheep and turkeys kept for         
Christmas. Another section covers an   
area of 55 acres used for grazing      
cattle.  This farm has 68 Fresian cows 
and 21 younger stock.  They have a     
number of farming machines including 3 
tractors, baler, mower and turner.  Mr.
H. Lewis of Oak Farm was interviewed   
and stated his family had been farmers 
for only 5 years.  He is pleased with  
the facilities, machines and land, and 
does not consider moving as he likes   
the area.  The farm buildings are old  
brick-built facing onto the road       
leading into Drayton Bassett village.
