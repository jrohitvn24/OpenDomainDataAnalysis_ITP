		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF CARRIE</title>
		<content>The worlds noisiest alarm clock woke me
up at 8.00 am.I sleepily turned it     
off.When I had got changed and got     
washed I went downstairs to have some  
coco pops.In the newspaper I looked to 
see if anything was on television only 
Pigeon Street so I went into my bedroom
to play.Then I went out again because I
did not want to play anything.         
Later on I had to go to the shop for   
mum.She said I could have a bag of     
sweets to eat.On the way I stopped at  
the scarlet postbox to post a letter   
that mum gave me.                      
On the way back I decided to ask       
Helen to go to the Green.When I got    
home I called for her.Helen could play.
So we walked together.                 
Half an hour later I was having my     
dinner.I fell asleep on my             
beanbag.After playing with Helen it had
been a busy day!                       </content>
