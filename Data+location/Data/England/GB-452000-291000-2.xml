		<title>02ATTITUDES TO THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> A questionnaire was sent out to find  
 out what people's attitudes were about
 the village.The majority of people    
 said that they don't like all the new 
 building taking place.Nearly everyone 
 thought that the traffic should go    
 past the village and not through      
 it.The opinion was very much divided  
 about people moving into the village. 
 Everyone thought that the village will
 be much bigger and a lot of people    
 said they wouldn't like it.All the    
 people we asked said that we need more
 shops and a leisure centre with       
 a swimming pool.Children had various  
 other ideas on what to have such as a 
 B.M.X.track,an arcade,a properly run  
 youth club and a roller skating rink. 
 The vast majority we asked said they  
 minded all the building taking place  
 because it was spoiling the           
 surrounding countryside.              </content>
