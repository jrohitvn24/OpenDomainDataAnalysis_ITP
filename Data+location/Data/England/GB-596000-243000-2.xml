		<content>No airfields are presently in this     
area, though the concrete control tower
of a Second World War ('39-'45) RAF    
Airfield is between Stackyard Green and
Spring Farm House in square one.  This 
was, and is, a flat field and has no   
indications of runways.                
There are, however, three RAF airfields
in the area and the skies over this    
area are tracked by high flying large  
trans-ocean aircraft and fighter       
aircraft.  The fighter aircraft from   
one airfield take off and make landing 
 approaches over this area, and react  
 to 'intrusions'from  USSR aircraft.   
                                       
 hey take-off on re-heat and make very 
noisy steep ascents turning onto       
easterly bearings.  American           
Tankbusters practice anti-tank skills  
by hedge-hopping over these fields.
