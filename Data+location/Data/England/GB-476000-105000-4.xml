		<content>                                       
                                       
 I live on a chicken and cattle farm.I 
 do not know much about the cattle side
 of the farm but my Dad is the manager 
 of the chicken side.The company's name
 is Broadbridge.they have three farms  
 around Bosham,I live on one near West 
 Ashling.                              
   It is quite big and it has 78,000   
 chickens.There are five houses and is 
 going to be made bigger,upto 120,000  
 chickens.I have lived on two other    
 chicken farms and they had the eggs   
 collected by hand,but where I live,the
 eggs are on belts and they come       
 through all the houses and into the   
 biggest one where they are sorted out 
 and packed.The egg lorry comes twice a
 week and then the eggs go up to Thames
 Valley Eggs.
