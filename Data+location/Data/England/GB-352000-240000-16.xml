		<title>16FLORA OF THE LUGG FLATS</title>
		<content>    The Lugg Flats are flooded whenever
 the River Lugg rises above a certain  
 level and this flooding increases the 
 value of the grazing.                 
    The area is held "in common" from  
 Lammas to Candlemas.  For the rest of 
 the year owners can take hay crops    
 from their individual plots which are 
 marked with stones.                   
    The flora of the Flats is unique.  
 To save the Snakes Head fritillaries  
 the Nature Trust has become one of the
 Lugg Flats Commoners and the rare     
 Ophioglossum Fern has recently been   
 rediscovered there. Perennial pools in
 water courses passing under the main  
 road contain an interesting Flora     
 including Water Dropworts, Flowering  
 Rush, Arrowhead and Water Plantain.   
    The variety of Flora in the area   
 has led it to be designated as an     
 "Area of Special Scientific Interest".</content>
