		<title>07LIVING IN A RURAL AREA</title>
		<content>   Modern farming methods and increased
 mobility have had the greatest impact 
 on this area in recent years. The     
 traditional market gardening has all  
 but disappeared, as has the small     
 mixed farm. Very few orchards or plum 
 plantations remain. In their place are
 huge fields which do not have the     
 attraction of the jigsaw effect of the
 small fields dotted with cattle and   
 sheep. In them giant machines work    
 miracles of transformation at peak    
 harvest times.                        
   Housing in the villages is of a wide
 and varying type, catering for the    
 needs and demands of all classes.     
   The area contains thriving village  
 communities. Churches, two schools,   
 modern public houses and a host of    
 village organisations catering for all
 ages. All these offer the promise of a
 secure future for the villages.       </content>
