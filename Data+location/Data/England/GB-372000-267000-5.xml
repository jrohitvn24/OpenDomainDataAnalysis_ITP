{ST.Mary's CHURCH.}Its tall spire      
 stands proudly between the old village
 and the Council estate in Suffolk     
 Lane and can be clearly seen from most
 of the parish.It was consecrated in   
 1852, so it is not very old.Most of   
 the church services are held here.    
 Picturesque views can be seen from the
 churchyard- especially of the Abberley
 Hills and the valley leading to       
 Stourport.                            
{Public Houses.}The village "pub" is in
 the old village now called the {MANOR 
{ARMS}previously called the {Bromley   
{Arms}and is very old. Another public  
 house is a mile and a half from       
 Abberley,on the Clows Top road        
 straddling the parish boundary of     
 Pensax and Abberley.It is another     
 small country pub called {THE BELL.}  </content>
