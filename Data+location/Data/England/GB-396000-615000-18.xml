		<title>18ALNHAM MOOR FARM</title>
		<content> Alnham moor farm has been in the      
 hands of the same family for many     
 years. It is on the private road from 
 Hartside to Bleakhope. It consists of 
 a stone-built farmhouse and a few old 
 sheds. The farm is located on the     
 moorland but also has a little arable 
 land down by the river. Here hay is   
 grown for the stock in the winter     
 Until recently, an unusual            
 feature of this farm was the fact that
 hay was not baled, instead it was     
 piked.
