		<title>01THE AREA OF LEE MOOR.</title>
		<content> The Lee Moor area is situated on the  
 edge of Dartmoor,about five miles from
 Plymouth.The area with which we are   
 concerned is particularly associated  
 with the extraction of china clay.Much
 of the china clay which is extracted  
 from this area is used as a "filler"  
 for paper,although china clay is used 
 for the manufacture of many other     
 products as well.The village of Lee   
 Moor mainly developed because of the  
 fact that china clay was found        
 there,although these days many of the 
 people who live there are elderly.It  
 is likely that the extraction of china
 clay will continue here for many      
 years.The highest point in the area is
 Penn Beacon,from where Plymouth Sound 
 and the surrounding coastline can be  
 seen.
