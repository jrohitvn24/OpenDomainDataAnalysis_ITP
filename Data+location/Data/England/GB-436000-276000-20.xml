		<title>20Stoke Floods  (and Credits)</title>
		<content> One of the nicest parts of the whole  
 area is STOKE FLOODS. A nature reserve
 managed by Warwickshire Nature        
 Conservation Trust. The site covers an
 area of 19 acres, rough grassland and 
 open water and is the home of many    
 species of birds.                     
                                       
 The information for this project was  
 collected and recorded by children    
 from three local Primary Schools.
