		<content> We know from the original{Domesday    
{Book of 1086}that 22 families then    
 lived in what was known as{Wivelingham
 (the present day Willingham).         
 By 1251 the Ely Coucher Book shows    
 that this had grown to 75 families -  
 say{300 people.                       
 By the mid 16th Century the population
 of Willingham had risen to 500 or so. 
 At the time of the{Civil War}the      
 figure of{600}was reached.            
 It was in the early 1800's that the   
 village population began to grow      
 rapidly and passed the{1600}mark.     
 The advent of the railway led to a    
 further population increase as the    
 ability to move the area's            
 agricultural produce stepped up trade.
{By 1960}more than{1750 people}lived in
 Willingham and since then has         
 followed the most rapid growth to the 
 present day figure of{over 2700.      </content>
