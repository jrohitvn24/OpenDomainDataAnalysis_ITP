		<title>10Silverton Park Farm</title>
		<content>   This 320 acre{farm}is owned by Mr.  
 Alford. He rises at 7.30 a.m. to      
 organise his men and to sort out the  
 electric fencing. His haymaking was   
 adversely affected by the recent rain.
    He owns a herd of pedigree Friesian
 cows, 5 bulls, 1 dog and 1 cat. He has
 4 children, 1 of whom wants to farm   
 part of the land when older.These days
 there is a need to specialise and so  
 he no longer keeps sheep and pigs.    
    A cow should calve once a year, his
 last calf being born on Sunday. The   
{milk}is cooled to 40 degrees ready for
 piping into the lorry to take it to   
 the depot. The milk is weighed once a 
 month for quality checks. Milking is  
 twice a day.                          
     We saw silage, cows' feet being   
 dipped and registration certificates. 
 All the feeding is controlled by      
{computer}and this surprised us.       </content>
