		<content>{Population. }Many Salehurst School    
 children have more than two siblings. 
 A fair proportion have grandparents,  
 uncles and aunts nearby.              
{Employment. }The majority of their    
 fathers work locally.Some work in     
 Robertsbridge on farms,in trade or at 
 the Gypsum Mines.A lesser number      
 commute to London.Mothers tend to work
 part time in the village.             
{Life Styles. }Many of the inhabitants 
 of Robertsbridge have spent their     
 whole lives there and it is a close   
 knit community.Most of our children   
 live in terraced houses or cottages,  
 most have been abroad and have cars,  
 videos or computers at home.          
{Recreation. }The most common family   
 past-time is watching television.     
 Swimming and walking is popular.At    
 least half the children are involved  
 in regular community activities.      </content>
