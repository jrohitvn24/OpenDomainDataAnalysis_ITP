		<content> There is a sports field at Redhill and
 another at Felton,part of which is in 
 this area.Also at Redhill there are a 
 youth club and village club in the    
 village hall,skittles and darts teams,
 the Women's Institute,the Redhill     
 Circle and a  pub-The Darlington Arms.
   Dances and discos are held in the   
 village hall and the village has two  
 football teams which play at Felton.  
   Motorbike scrambling takes place    
 near Scars Wood and there is some clay
 pigeon shooting near Redhill.         
   Apart from this there is little     
 organized recreation.There are many   
 footpaths and bridleways for walkers  
 and riders, and several families own  
 their own horses and ponies.          
   One footpath leads from Winter Lane,
 Redhill to Goblin Combe which is a    
 nature reserve(just out of our area). 
   Gardening is a very popular pastime.</content>
