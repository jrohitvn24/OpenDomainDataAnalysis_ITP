		<title>10PILSLEY P.S. VISITS MINEHEAD</title>
		<content> Our school holiday in 1985 was at     
 Minehead. We went from the 13th April 
 to the 20th. We went by Hogg's Coaches
 and we stopped at Bristol for lunch.  
 Later on we went to the Fleet Air Arm 
 Museum at Yeovilton.                  
 We had to stay in chalets at the      
 Butlin's Camp. In our chalet there    
 were four people.                     
 We did activities like abseiling,     
 swimming, netball, craft and football.
 My favourite activities were abseiling
 and trampolining.                     
 We had days out as well, like Combe   
 Sydenham Elizabethan Manor House and  
 we went to Watchet on the West        
 Somerset Railway. Later on we went to 
 Blue Anchor beach.                    
 On Friday we went shopping and on     
 Saturday we came home.
