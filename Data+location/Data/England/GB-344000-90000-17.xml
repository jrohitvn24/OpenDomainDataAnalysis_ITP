		<content>      St. Mary's Voluntary Controlled  
 Primary School is the largest primary 
 school in West Dorset. It functions   
 from two sites: the Infant Department 
 in Gundry Lane and the Junior School  
 in King Street. The King Street       
 buildings once housed Bridport        
 General School. Today the Bridport    
 Teachers' Centre shares the site. St. 
 Mary's is due to be rehoused within   
 the next two years in a new building  
 at St.Mary's Fields.                  
      In Flood Lane is Mountjoy School,
 a County Mixed Day School for children
 with severe and complex learning      
 difficulties. The school can          
 accommodate sixty five. Places  are   
 offered to Dorset children, those in  
 Cheshire Homes and then to bordering  
 counties.
