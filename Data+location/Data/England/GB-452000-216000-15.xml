		<title>15Weston Manor</title>
		<content> Though most of the present building   
 dates from the 16th century a manor   
 house has stood on this site since the
 early medieval period.  Once a private
 family residence, Weston Manor is now 
 a thriving country hotel.             
                                       
 The{hotel}has 23 bedrooms and a       
 licensed restaurant.  It is a popular 
 calling place for{foreign tourists    
 and hosts numerous conferences and    
 wedding receptions.  Most of its staff
 of 50 are local people.  The present  
 owners are undertaking a sympathetic  
 restoration programme which also      
 provides work for local craftsmen.    
                                       
 Steeped in Civil War history, the     
 Manor has 3{ghost legends:}Mad Maude, 
 a profligate nun burned at the stake, 
 a dairymaid who fell to her death from
 the Tower and a phantom coach.        </content>
