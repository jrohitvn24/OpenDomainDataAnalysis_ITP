		<title>13FARMING AROUND CHARLBURY</title>
		<content>  There are 8 biggish farms around     
Charlbury. Most of them are arable.    
Walcot Farm is situated on the         
Oxfordshire Way,next to the Cotswold   
Railway Line.It has livestock as well. 
Shorthampton Farm is beside the old    
church in Shorthampton.                
  In Spelsbury we find Glebe Farm next 
to the church, and Grove Farm. Both    
these farms are arable but also have   
sheep,cows and the usual hens.         
  Over the years,what was traditionally
sheep country has been turned over to  
arable farming or intensively managed  
grassland.                             
  This area, particularly around the   
villages of Spelsbury and Chadlington  
is criss-crossed by public footpaths.  
The nearby Cornbury Estate owns lots   
of the land,and the small woods, which 
are remnants of Wychwood Forest.These  
are left as cover for game birds.      </content>
