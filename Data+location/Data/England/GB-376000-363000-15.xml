		<title>15Brereton Heath Park (cont).</title>
		<content> The Heath and Woodland is crossed by  
 many footpaths and bridlepaths on     
 which many people take their{exercise 
 both on foot and on horseback.Here    
 they can enjoy the wide variety of the
{flora and fauna.}Circling the lake on 
 one of these paths,one can view the   
 water most of the time, on which large
 varieties of waterbird and wader come 
 in to feed.                           
          Due to the popularity of the 
 Park, it has introduced a tremendous  
 volume of{traffic}to the area         
 especially at the weekends.This has   
 produced problems for local farmers   
 during Summer months, when they have  
 been trying to get passed the Quarry  
 area with loaded tractors and have    
 been thwarted by the parked cars which
 are usually on both sides of the road.
