		<title>09Home life in Sebergham</title>
		<content>    Homelife is still simple in the    
 majority of homes, though the farm-   
 houses and larger houses are now of a 
 high standard.  Heating throughout the
 house is usual in the majority of     
 homes though the expense of running   
 this these days means families are    
 careful not to heat those parts of the
 house not in everyday use.            
    Many country families keep dogs and
 cats as pets.  The owner of the former
 Rectory built in 1876 having 2 horses 
 4 dogs 6 cats and a few hens for eggs.
    Farmers keep working dogs which are
 usually kennelled outside in buildings
    Three meals a day are usual though 
 times of these vary depending on      
 social group.                         
    Farmers start milking at 7am and   
 again at 4pm, whilst at harvest time  
 work long hours and even into the     
 night with lights on their tractors.  </content>
