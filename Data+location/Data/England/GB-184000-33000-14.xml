		<content> The majority of full time work is in  
 shops,building work,fishing or        
 professional services such as banks,  
 building societies and schools.       
 Another category of employment in the 
 area is where residents travel out of 
 the block.These people work in towns  
 where there is a greater demand       
 employees and a wider range of jobs to
 cater for their skills.The majority of
 these workers are employed in places  
 like Truro,St.Austell and Falmouth,   
 where there are more offices and      
 industrial premises.These people      
 travel either by private coaches      
 operating a regular service or by     
 private car.Because wages in the area 
 are low or because many jobs are part 
 time,a lot of families have to add to 
 their income,often with the wife in   
 the family working part time also.
