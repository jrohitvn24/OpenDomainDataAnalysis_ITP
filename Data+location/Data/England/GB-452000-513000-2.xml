		<content>{Upsall Hall,}a beautiful 100 year old 
 estate set in scenic surroundings, is 
 now a centre for handicapped people.  
 There are plans to develop the        
 facilities for the use of the         
 community as a leisure farm and picnic
 site. In Nunthorpe Village there is a 
 working {blacksmith's forge.}With the 
 decline in the use of horses for      
 transport since the beginning of this 
 century, blacksmiths have become quite
 rare. Present day blacksmiths cater   
 almost exclusively for the leisure    
 rider. Across the road is{Nunthorpe   
{Hall.}This lovely old building stands 
 in beautiful grounds with an          
 ornamental pond. The hall is presently
 used as a home for the elderly. Near  
 to Nunthorpe Village is the           
 substantial complex of{Poole Hospital.
 Nearby is the oldest of the four      
 Churches}in the area.                 </content>
