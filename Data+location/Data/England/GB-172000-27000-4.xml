		<content> Senior citizens;change of life style. 
 Many changes have occured in the past 
 years since the 1945 war.There was no 
 running water supply to houses .Water 
 was drawn from the village supply at  
 various points which can still be     
 seen.A"leat" or opendrain ran down    
 both sides of the village street      
 draining away surplus water.No sewage 
 system existed in 1945 and cesspits   
 were in use.These things have now     
 changed and we have our own mains     
 water supply from Stithians reservoir 
 and a sewage works at Ponjeravah.In   
 1945 we had a bus service to Falmouth 
 via Port Navas and to Helston daily.  
 Now we have only 3 buses to Falmouth  
 per week and 2 per day to Helston.    
 Inthe old days the village made its   
 own entertainment where today we have 
 radio and television in our homes.    
 Also an Over Sixties Club.            </content>
