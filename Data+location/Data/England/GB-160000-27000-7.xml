		<content> During this first period of settlement
 the lowland areas of Cornwall were    
 still densely forested thus making any
 clear land such as Tregonning Hill    
 more significant and of greater       
 importance. Improved farming          
 techniques, however, enabled lowland  
 areas to be cleared making upland     
 clear areas less important.           
                                       
       The second period occured from  
 1746 onwards when a Plymouth chemist  
 called {William Cookworthy}was        
 visiting the prosperous Great Work Tin
 Mine on the side of Tregonning Hill   
 where a mine captain was his friend.  
 He was taken to the hill top to be    
 shown a new mine impliment and he     
 noticed the miners making repairs with
 an odd clay. He realised its          
 importance and the{china clay industry
 was established                       </content>
