		<content> The cap of Titterstone Clee Hill is   
 formed from a hard igneous rock known 
 as Dhu Stone,which was very popular   
 for road-making and used all over the 
 country for sett-making.Dhu Stone is  
 still quarried on the west side of    
 Titterstone and from 1908 Dhu Stone   
 was quarried on the east side near the
 Magpie at Catherton.                  
 There was no easy way to carry this   
 stone away and so an aerial rope-way  
 was constructed to carry buckets of   
 stone on wire-ropes supported by      
 trestles from Catherton via an        
 angle-station to Detton Ford,where it 
 was transferred to railway trucks and 
 taken on the Ditton Priors railway to 
 Cleobury Mortimer where it was        
 transferred to the main ralway lines  
 and was taken all over the country to 
 be used for roads.
