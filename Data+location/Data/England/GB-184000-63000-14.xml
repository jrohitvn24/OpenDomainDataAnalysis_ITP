 Mr and Mrs Joyce have run the Falcon  
 Inn from 1970.It is very busy in the  
 summer with tourists,but very quiet in
 the winter when the best nights are   
 Monday and Sunday.Beer garden,and     
 childrens bar are popular in the      
 summer.The most popular adult drink is
 Bass,and childrens drink Pepsi.Two    
 arcade games are provided.The inn has 
 16 rooms,and is popular after cricket 
 and football.Food is served and the   
 kitchen has a good reputation.The pub 
 is called the Falcon because Catholic 
 Priests persecuted in Elizabethan     
 times came to the Inn to say          
 Mass.Falcons were released as a signal
 to the Catholic community.            
     It is a very attrative pub with   
 its well kept gardens,which employs a 
 number of local people in the summer. </content>
