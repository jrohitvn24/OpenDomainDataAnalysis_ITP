    COMPULSORY EDUCATION IN THIS AREA  
IS BASED ON THE THREE TIER COMPREHEN-  
SIVE SYSTEM.CHILDREN FROM THE WEST ROW 
AREA ATTEND THE VILLAGE SCHOOL BEFORE  
TRANSFERRING AT 9+ TO THE RIVERSIDE    
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND AT 13+ TO THE UPPER  
SCHOOL,BOTH IN MILDENHALL.             
    WEST ROW C.P.SCHOOL WAS BUILT IN   
1874,FOLLOWING THE EDUCATION ACT OF    
1870.IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR    
220 CHILDREN AND UNTIL 1939 CATERED    
FOR PUPILS FROM 5 TO 14 YEARS.SINCE    
THEN IT HAS BEEN MUCH IMPROVED WITH    
THE ADDITION OF A HALL,A KITCHEN AND A 
CLASSROOM BUT IT STILL RETAINS ITS     
FINE VICTORIAN EXTERIOR.               
    INCLUDING THE HEADMASTER THERE ARE 
4 TEACHERS AND 99 CHILDREN ON ROLL,A   
QUARTER  OF WHOM ARE BROUGHT IN FROM   
OUTLYING AREAS.
