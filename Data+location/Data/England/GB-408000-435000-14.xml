		<content> The general view of Sandy Lane is that
 it is quite a hilly place. The hills  
 are not sharp pointed but are rounded 
 and have a nice slope to them. A lot  
 of the area is used for hay and       
 cattle. It is pasture land.           
  There are about four farms in the    
 area but one is now a riding stable.  
 Most of the walls are dry uncut stone 
 so if the wind blows it can get       
 through the gaps without blowing the  
 wall down.                            
  The trees grow in clumps of one and  
 two apart from the woods at Chellow   
 Dene. There are springs, and a beck   
 flows down the hill.                  
  Sandy Lane is really cut into four   
 parts by the two main roads which join
 at the crossroads to make the four    
 quarters.
