		<content> Apart from the Village Hall, the      
School tends to be the central meeting 
point involving most organisations at  
various times of the year.The School   
Annual Fete brings together a large    
secton of the population who are able  
to enjoy the various sideshows and     
stalls organised by the Parent Teacher 
Organisation. Another highlight is the 
Christmas Entertainment which is held  
in the Methodist Chapel, as there is no
hall provided at the School.The Chapel 
is turned into a theatre with stage and
lighting and about 300 people attend   
each of the two evening performances. A
Christmas Bazaar follows the second    
performance, at the School. Sports Day 
brings many visitors.Other events      
include End of Term Concerts showing   
the childrens' skills in acting, music,
and gymnastics,and Parents Evenings to 
discuss educational and school matters.</content>
