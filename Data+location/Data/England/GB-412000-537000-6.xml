		<content>                                       
{Jaimie got up at 8.00am, washed, took 
{off her pyjamas and dressed in a light
{green sweater and pinstripe jeans. Her
{breakfast was toast and a cup of tea. 
  After she had finished she called    
 for her friend,Deborah.They played    
 some games; one of which was "tiggie".
{ Some time later Jaimie went for      
{her lunch of corned beef sandwiches   
{and a drink of coke.                  
  The afternoon was spent playing in   
 Deborah's tent with the Sindy dolls.  
{ At about 5.00pm Jaimie had her tea of
{chips, beans and beefburgers.         
  After tea she watched T.V. ("Tom and 
 Jerry" and "Dynasty") before going in 
 the bath at 9.00pm.                   
{ Tired out Jaimie went to bed at      
{10.00pm and read a book for a while   
{before going to sleep.
