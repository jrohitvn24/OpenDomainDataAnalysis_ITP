 Goodwood farm is called Home Farm.    
 There are six houses where the farm   
 managers and workers live, one barn   
 and some follows - on pens at the back
 of the farm.  there is also a tractor 
 shed and a large shed round the back  
 where we keep the combine harvesters  
 and a workshop next door.             
                                       
 The three fields behind the farm are  
 for cows and sheep.  There are also   
 two bulls and some Suffolk rams.  The 
 herd of Friesen dairy cows are in     
 another two fields, and nearby is the 
 dairy.  There is one house for the    
 milkman, a barn and a dairy shed.     
 Wood from the forest behind the farm  
 is used for fencing and repairs.
