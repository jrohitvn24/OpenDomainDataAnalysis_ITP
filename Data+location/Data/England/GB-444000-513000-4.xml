		<content> Ingleby Barwick is a new private      
 residential estate built on the       
 southern perimeter of the old Thornaby
 airfield.It was officially opened in  
 1981 by the mayor of Langbaurgh,a     
 borough of Cleveland County.The estate
 caters for the demand in the home     
 market from the small terrace to the  
 large detatched.Three main contractors
 are involved,each offering their own  
 individuality.The main criticisms from
 the new residents concern amenities,  
 access and communications.There are no
 shops,pubs,school or leisure centre   
 although the estate is now 5 years old
 and reasonably established.Poor bus   
 service,inadeqate road surfaces and a 
 feeling of isolation all combine to   
 give the majority of residents a sense
 of neglect.This would appear to be a  
 common problem_the failure to supply  
 the basic requirements of a community.</content>
