		<content> Bruton has its own playing field,     
 where the town football and cricket   
 clubs play throughout the year.  Also 
 on the site is the local youth club,  
 as well as an adventure playing area  
 for the younger children.  In the town
 are branches of the Boy Scouts and    
 Girl Guides, the Royal British Legion 
 and the Women's Institute.  The Church
 Rooms are the centre for most of their
 activities.  The Ward Library is run  
 by Somerset County Council, and is    
 well stocked for a small library;  it 
 includes a small reading room, where  
 displays are mounted regularly.  The  
 Parish Council meets every month,     
 whilst the local Chamber of Commerce  
 has been reformed recently to promote 
 trade in the town. The recently       
 completed flkood aleviation scheme    
 also includes provision for a         
 riverside walk.                       </content>
