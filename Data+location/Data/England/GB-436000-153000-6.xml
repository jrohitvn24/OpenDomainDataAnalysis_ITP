		<content>{St.Peter's Church}at{Hurstbourne      
{Tarrant}was started in 1180.          
 The oldest remaining part of it is the
 arch in the porch, on either side of  
 which is an animal's head. As you go  
 into the church, the head on the right
 is of a lion and on the left is an    
 eagle's head. They are not realistic, 
 probably because the artist had never 
 seen a lion or an eagle.              
 The pillars are very big and solid,   
 and there is some mediaeval graffiti  
 scratched on some of those in the     
 south aisle. The outline of a bird,   
 and what looks like a gallows can be  
 seen.                                 
 The font is also very old and the     
 tiles under it have been dated to     
 the 12th century. The Sanctuary tiles 
 were later made to match them.        
 Some original wall paintings can      
 still be seen in the north aisle.     </content>
