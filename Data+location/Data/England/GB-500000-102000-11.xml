		<title>11THE A.C.A.</title>
		<content>  The A.C.A. started in mid. 1982 with 
 a small Bedford bus . It picked senior
 citizens from door to door on sundays 
 to take them on mystery tours. They   
 soon got bigger and better buses.     
  Nobody who helps gets paid and the   
 money to pay for the buses comes from 
 donations.                            
  They take small children to old      
 people and they have to pay. The      
 normal bus routes are half the price  
 and the clubs pay 15p to 20p. They    
 have  7 buses, 7 cars and a van. they 
 are not getting anymore buses but are 
 thinking about getting another garage 
 as it would make it easier .          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
