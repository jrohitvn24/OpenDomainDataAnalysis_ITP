		<title>03Houses &amp; gardens in Ousden</title>
		<content> The houses vary in size, age and      
 appearance. Some have as many as 6 or 
 7 rooms, and some are more modest with
 3 or 4. All have modern amenities with
 piped water, electricity, at least one
 bathroom and an indoor lavatory, but  
 houses away from centre of village do 
 not have main drainage. Most of the   
 dwellings are owner occupied, 1 or 2  
 are weekend retreats, and the council 
 houses are mostly rented. A few of the
 houses are picturesquely thatched and 
 there are a few bungalows. One house, 
 the Rectory dates from 1600, and this 
 has been successfully renovated over  
 the years. One interesting conversion 
 is the village school now a private   
 house. The size of gardens varies from
 a quarter to one acre, and these are  
 often landscaped and laid out with    
 lawns and flowerbeds. About \ the     
 inhabitants grow some vegetables.     </content>
