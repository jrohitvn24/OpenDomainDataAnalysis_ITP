		<content> The main public entrance and car park 
 to {Elvaston Castle Country Park}is   
 sited here.The woodland is bounded by 
{a hedge}which was dated as being{over 
{four hundred years old}by counting    
 seven different species of trees and  
 woody shrubs in a 100m.length.It      
 contained oak,sycamore,Canadian       
 balsam,beech,mountain ash,elderberry  
 and lime.The area is{rich in wildlife.
  Land to the east of the{B5010        
 provides part of the grazing for a    
 flock of 120 sheep and a herd of 30   
{Friesian}and{Ayrshire}suckling        
 cattle.In addition to the silage      
 produced,barley is grown in one large 
 and two smaller fields.A disused,brick
 outbuilding stands in this area.Hedges
 have grown untended and a few have    
 been removed.Food and shelter for     
 wildlife is provided by the hedges and
 a number of scattered,mature trees.   </content>
