		<title>03The High Peak Trail</title>
		<content> The High Peak Trail originally linked 
 Cromford and Peak Forests canals.Horse
 drawn then steam pulled trains were   
 used.Now bought by the County Council 
 it goes from Cromford to Buxton and   
 is used for{walking,biking,picnicking,
{ rock climbing,horse riding}and       
{attracting tourists.}                 
 We think it is good because you can   
 use it{any time}you want.Old buildings
 ,inclines,embankments,bridges and     
 other remains are interesting.It goes 
 over some spectacular scenery.Because 
 in holiday times the volume of        
 visitors increases the trail is       
 patrolled by Country_side Rangers     
 whose jobs include planting trees and 
 cleaning up the country side.They     
 often involve local schools and       
 communities.For example our class     
 planted 100 trees.
