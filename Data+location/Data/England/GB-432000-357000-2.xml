		<title>02Lea Green</title>
		<content>   Lea Green is in the small village of
 Lea near Matlock, Derbyshire and is   
 set in 25 acres of ground.The earliest
 record of Lea Green goes back to a    
 large house built in 1761.            
    In 1895 the building was sold to   
{Mr.J.B. Marsden Smedley,}a local mill 
 owner, who extended the main house. In
 1960 the{Derbyshire County Council    
 bought the house and grounds to       
 convert it into a sports centre.      
    Today Lea Green is usually known   
 for its sports and local outdoor      
 activities.There are many courses open
 to all age groups and up to 40 people 
 may sleep at the centre. Next to the  
 house is a large sports hall and      
 tennis court. The house inside has    
 been kept in its original state with  
 much fine woodwork, carving and       
 panelling. Indeed one room is entirely
 decorated with leather panelling.     </content>
