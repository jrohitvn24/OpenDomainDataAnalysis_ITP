		<title>15      LIFE ON OSEA</title>
		<content> Like the other farmers we interviewed 
 Mr.Anderson,the farm manager,does not 
 find that life on the island poses any
 great problems. However some careful  
 planning is necessary if problems are 
 to be avoided. The island is cut off  
 by the tide for 4 hours out of every  
 12 and therefore arrangements have    
 been made for helicopter evacuation in
 case of medical emergency.            
   The island's water supply comes from
 a 400ft. deep well. Electricity and   
 telephone services come via cable from
 the mainland at Goldhanger.Wood,calor 
 gas and solid fuel are used in cold   
 weather for heating.                  
   There is a postal service but no    
 newspapers are delivered.             
   Of the 4 chilren on the island only 
 1 is of schoolage. She is taken either
 by boat or by car to Heybridge Primary
