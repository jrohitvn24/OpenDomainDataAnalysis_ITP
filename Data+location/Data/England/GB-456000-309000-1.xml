		<title>01THE BIRSTALL D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> The area which we surveyed is         
 primarily rural with no industrial    
 centres. It lies on the partly mixed  
 and clay soil, forced up as a glacier 
 moved along the course of the river   
 Soar in the Ice Age. Essentially      
 agricultural, it is dominated by the  
 residential nature of Birstall which  
 is mentioned in the{Domesday Book.    
    The block stretches from the ruins 
 of Birstall Lodge in the south to the 
 Rothley Terminus of the Main LIne     
 Steam Trust in the north and from     
 Cropston Cemetery in the west to      
 Wanlip Sewage Works in the east.      
    The report covers the whole block  
 but we have concentrated on the centre
 of population.{Unfortunately some of  
{the historically interesting features 
{fall outside the D-Block}i.e. Our Lady
 and St. Nicholas Church at Wanlip and 
 Old Birstall.                         </content>
