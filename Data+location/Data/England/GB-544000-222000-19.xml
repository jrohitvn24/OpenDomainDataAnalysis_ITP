		<title>19LOCAL SETTLEMENTS</title>
		<content>    The survey area contains relatively
 few settlements which is perhaps      
 surprising in a densely populated part
 of Britain. The rural landscape is    
 still dominated by scattered villages 
 and hamlets but the structure of these
 is very different today than it was   
 even a century ago. Today there are   
 very few people who actually live and 
 work in these settlements yet their   
 populations are for the most part     
 higher than they were when the        
 community was dominated by            
 agriculture. The reasons for this is  
 the much reduced need for workers in  
 farming with the introduction of      
 machinery on a wide scale, and today's
 increased mobility through the use of 
 the motor car which has allowed the   
 more wealthy to buy desirable homes in
 the country and for them to commute to
 work in the towns.                    </content>
