		<content>    The centre of Narborough is quite  
 old and very small.Parts of the       
 pavements are cobbled.The centre is   
 based around the church,which looks   
 like a castle.                        
    In the newer parts of Narborough   
 there are  more facilities.There are  
 not many shops,but they sell a wide   
 variety of goods.We have a small      
 library.There are two pubs; The       
 Narborough Arms is very old and made  
 of wood.We have three garages.There is
 a railway station,unusual in villages 
 in this area.There are two modern     
 Primary  Schools.There are also modern
 houses and more being built.Next to   
 Narborough park are the Blaby District
 Council Offices.Around Narborough are 
 a few factories.
