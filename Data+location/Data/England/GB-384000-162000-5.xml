 This rural area is policed by two     
 police officers one male and one      
 female - based at Melksham some three 
 miles away. The area is patrolled by  
 car combined with foot patrols.       
 Back-up cover is provided by Melksham 
 police station and by divisional      
 traffic patrol vehicles.              
 COURTS                                
 Local magistrates courts are held     
 weekly at Melksham and fortnightly at 
 Bradford-on-Avon. Serious crimes would
 normally be heard at Swindon Crown    
 Court before a judge and jury.        
 CRIMES                                
 The crimes which predominate in this  
 area are minor thefts and instances of
 criminal damage.
