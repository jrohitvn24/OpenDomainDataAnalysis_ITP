		<title>10RAILWAYS IN NEW MILLS/DISLEY</title>
		<content> Railways were important in this area  
 and quite a lot of streets have names 
 which show their associations with    
 railways. It carried a lot of         
 goods including coal and other        
 minerals and there used to be in      
 existance a number  of railway        
 companies in New Mills.               
 All the lines begin at Manchester     
 Piccadily.The Newtown line goes to    
 Buxton and the New Mills Central line 
 travels to Sheffield.The railways     
 today are mainly used to carry hikers 
 to the Peak District,train spotting   
 and commutting to cities for work.    
 From where ever you live in the area  
 you can see the rusty lines and the   
 noise of trains wake people up.The    
 track is an endless ladder winding    
 through the valleys linking us to     
 other places.By Daniel Jones.
