		<title>01Cinque Ports Connection</title>
		<content> Every year in June the{Mayor of       
{Sandwich}comes  to visit              
 Brightlingsea.He used to come to make 
 sure that the{Deputy}was doing his job
 well but now it's just to keep up the 
 tradition. When Brightlingsea and the 
{Cinque Ports}became friends,the Mayor 
 of Sandwich decided to come down and  
 elect a head man (who they now call   
 the Deputy),who would look after the  
 town and things.When the Mayor of     
 Sandwich came down there wasn't a     
 Mayor of Brightlingsea.The reason the 
 Mayor of Sandwich did this was because
 then his men would have somewhere to  
 land when it was rough at sea. When   
 the Sandwich fishermen were caught in 
 a storm they used to come to          
 Brightlingsea for shelter and to mend 
 their nets and boats.Every time they  
 came they had a nice welcome so they  
 became friends.                       </content>
