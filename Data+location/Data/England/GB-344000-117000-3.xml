		<content>      Many changes have taken place at 
 Martock Recreation field recently. A  
 special hall for{cubs, scouts,        
{brownies and girl guides}has been     
 built.  People had to raise a lot of  
 money and put in a lot of effort to   
 build the hall.                       
      There is a{BMX bicycle track}in  
 Martock.  The BMX track is made of    
 mounds of earth.  Lots of children    
 take their BMXs down on the track for 
 fun. Two years ago there were two     
{tennis courts}built. Much money was   
 raised by grants and donations.  The  
 tennis club entered two mixed teams in
 the Yeovil league for the first time  
 this year. Last year a{cricket club   
 was formed and they raised money for  
 an artifcial all weather pitch. Last  
 year they played friendly matches but 
 this year they have entered 3         
 different leagues.                    </content>
