		<title>09FARMING - HIGHAMS FARM</title>
		<content> The farmhouse was built around 1400 by
 Thomas Higham. The farm was owned by  
 the Higham family for nealy 600 years.
 Around 1900 the Bunting family bought 
 the farm. A long long time ago the    
 barges used to sail down the river and
 deliver the grain into a cart which   
 is drawn by a horse. The farm has two 
 tractors, two combine harvesters and  
 one rape cutter. Mr.Bunting has       
 eight fields all together. The        
 farmhouse is in the middle of the     
 farm. You can see Osea Island if you  
 walk near the end of the farm.        
 In the eight fields we found out that 
 the farm grows:- 1.92 H. Rough Grass. 
 75.1 H.  Barley.  8.7 H. Fruit.       
 11.2 H. Cockstoot. 1.2 H. Veg. Seeds.
