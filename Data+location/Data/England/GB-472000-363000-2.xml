		<title>02FARMING AROUND OSSINGTON.(1)</title>
		<content>    The land of this mainly            
 agricultural area consists of a{heavy 
{loam soil,}on which many crops are    
 grown. These are{barley, wheat, oats  
 and{oilseed rape.}This is not an area 
 in which root crops are regularly     
 grown.{Sheep, dairy herds}and{beef    
{cattle}graze on the grassland.        
    There are three main agricultural  
 estates,{Ossington, Laxton}and        
{Thoresby,}as well as individually     
 owned farms, which employ an active   
 workforce. However farm implements are
 getting larger, therefore doing all   
 the land_work quicker, thus reducing  
 the need for manpower.                
    On some of the smaller farms       
 machines such as combine harvesters   
 are shared to help with cost cutting.
