		<title>11WENNINGTON HALL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Wennington Hall School is administered
 by the Lancashire Education Authority 
 and caters on a residential basis for 
 the special educational needs of 54   
 boys of secondary school age and of   
 normal intelligence, who have         
 difficulties associated with their    
 academic, social, emotional and/or    
 behavioural development which make    
 normal day secondary education        
 inappropriate for them. The school    
 aims to give a balanced education with
 intensive remedial or other help where
 needed, leading where possible to     
 external examinations and enabling the
 successful return home of a boy to    
 attend his local day secondary school.
 Where for some reason this is         
 impossible the school aims to equip a 
 boy to obtain suitable employment on  
 leaving. Close links are maintained   
 with the careers service.             </content>
