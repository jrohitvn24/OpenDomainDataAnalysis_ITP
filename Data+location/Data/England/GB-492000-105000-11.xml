		<title>11SCHOOLS IN THE PAST</title>
		<content> We asked Mrs.Smith What were the      
 schools like?                         
 Schools were alot more  formal than   
 they are today.There was a lot more   
 harshness in its discipline you had   
 to sit and not wander about the class 
 room or anything like that. When we   
 started school in the morning.You had 
 to get into line and march into       
 school.We sat at desks two together   
 with lids on top of the desks and     
 inside the desks we had our pens &amp;    
 books.On top there was an ink well    
 which had to be kept filled.Sometimes 
 people were naughty and flicked ink   
 on peoples clothes.We had to have     
 blotting paper which is an absorbent  
 paper.When you wrote with your pen    
 it left it moist so you had to blot   
 it so that it didn't go all over the  
 place.We learnt our tables and we had 
 to learn a lot of poetry.             </content>
