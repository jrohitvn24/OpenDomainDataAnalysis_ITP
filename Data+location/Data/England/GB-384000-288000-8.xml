		<title>08The Staffs-Worcester Canal</title>
		<content>The Staffs-Worcester Canal was built in
1782 by James Brindley.It is one of the
first canals in the country.It runs    
from the  River Severn at Stourport to 
the Trent Mersey Navigation at Great   
Heywood. It was built to carry         
coal,limestone and other heavy         
goods,and to join the Severn to the    
Trent,both of which were major         
routeways in the eighteenth century.   
The lock weirs on the Staffs-Worcester 
canal are unique.The weirs are away    
from the gates so that when the lock is
filled the boat does not get pushed    
about by the water which is flowing in.
Locks like these are at Swindon,       
Hinksford and Greensforge.             
Today the canal is mainly used for     
pleasure.People go for holidays on     
boats and anglers fish in it.There is a
marina at Ashwood (see separate entry) 
where boats are berthed.               </content>
