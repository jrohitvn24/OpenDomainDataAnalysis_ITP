		<content>Prices in Edenbridge were dearer than  
in the other nearby towns.             
In the 1960's-70's people were friendly
to each other and were welcomed into   
the town.  There was more horse riding 
and people were dependant on fresh     
foods. They had televisions and single 
tub washing machines. Freezer cabinets 
were extra on refridgerators.          
Local people interviewed recalled V.E. 
Day with mixed feelings. Others        
remembered the floods in the town.     
The Four Elms vicarage was sold in     
1982. The village pond used to be a    
pit, the earth was used for the housing
estates. 4 of which have been built    
since 1945. There has always been a    
P.O., butchers, &amp; a grocers, now there 
are also 2 antique shops and a garage  
built in 1960. The Chapel was built in 
1931. There are twlage halls and also a
Public house.                          </content>
