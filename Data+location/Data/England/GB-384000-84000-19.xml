		<title>19Wool Village...Housing</title>
		<content> Mr.Hyde,who will be 100 years old in  
 December 1985,tells us that when he   
 was a boy Wool was only a quarter of  
 its present size...there being houses 
 in Duck Street,High Street and Spring 
 Street only;the rest was fields.      
 Many of these houses were thatched.   
 Although most of the thatched houses  
 in Duck Street have been pulled down  
 to make room for modern bungalows,much
 has been preserved in the other two   
 streets.                              
 Whilst parts of the village have      
 retained their old world charm, a     
 great deal of modern building         
 development has taken place.          
 There are new Council estates and     
 estates of private housing.           
 Wool is fortunate in having a railway 
 station, so the village can be "home" 
 to commuters to                       
 Bournemouth,Southampton and London.   </content>
