		<content> I get up in the morning at 8.00. I    
 have a wash, get dressed and have my  
 breakfast. Then I watch TV for a  bit 
 I go to school at 8.55. First we have 
 register. Our first lesson is Reading 
 360 - it asks questions on cards about
 a story and there are puzzles in it.  
 After that it is playtime,then        
 Assembly. Maths is before dinner. We  
 have two choices of meal. After dinner
 I go to Friday club with some other   
 children and we sing with Miss Edwards
 and she plays her guitar. After that  
 it is netball or topic. Then it is
