		<title>10TRANSPORT IN SHALBOURNE AREA</title>
		<content> 7 out of 8 householders are car owners
 and 1 in 8 has more than one. A few of
 the young use mopeds and motorcycles; 
 a handful of all ages ride a bicycle  
 or walk within the village where there
 is also a car hire service.  A private
 company from outside the area provides
 twice weekly return{bus service}to    
 both Hungerford and Newbury; however  
 it is little used: even those with no 
 car usually have access to one and    
 there are no discretionary fares; it  
 is doubtful if buses would survive    
 were they not used for{schools        
{transport:}in term time a few children
 are bussed daily to the village       
 primary school and most older ones    
 taken to/from the Comprehensive in    
 Marlborough.{Trains}run from Bedwyn to
 London and the West Country but there 
 are no buses to the station. The{canal
 at Bedwyn is used only for recreation.</content>
