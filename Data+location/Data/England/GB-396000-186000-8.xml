		<title>08LEA &amp; GARSDON SCHOOL PRESENT</title>
		<content>    The hall, staffroom and kitchen are
 the original building, and in 1976    
 they were modernized and two double   
 classrooms were added. The hall which 
 used to be the whole school, is big   
 and tall and needs a lot of heating.  
 The new classrooms are low, need less 
 heating and have nice views over the  
 fields, but we need the lights on a   
 lot. Each double classroom has a      
 seperate library area with sliding    
 doors and two carpeted areas which can
 be curtained off. They are heated by  
 electric fans which suck in the cold  
 air and blow out hot air.             
    The new building is of bradstone,  
 to blend with the original part built 
 in Cotswold stone. There is a large   
 playing field with climbing frames,   
 hard netball court and seperate       
 infants' playground.
