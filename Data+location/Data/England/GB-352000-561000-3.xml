		<content>   There is an interesting walk up a   
 hill near the town centre, called The 
 Mote.It is a small isolated hill      
 thought to be glacial in origin and   
 was the base of an early 13th         
 cen                                   
 tury fortification. On the top of     
 the Mote is a statue of the 7th Earl  
 of Carlisle and there are excellent   
 views of Brampton.                    
  In the north-east of the area        
 surveyed is Lanercost Priory. Parts of
 this Augustinian Priory founded in    
 1169 are well preserved. Some of the  
 stones from Hadrian's Wall were used  
 in its constuction. It was destroyed  
 at least three times by the Scots.    
  The most famous historic building in 
 the area is Naworth Castle. It was the
 stronghold of the Dacre family in 1335
 and converted to a mansion by the     
 Howard family in the 17th century.    </content>
