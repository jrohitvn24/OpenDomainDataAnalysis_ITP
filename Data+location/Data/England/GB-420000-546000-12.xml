		<content>   Potatoes are also grown(the acreage 
 of which has reduced after two years  
 of poor prices).                      
   If possible winter barley and winter
 wheat are grown,if conditions are     
 difficult in the autumn spring barley 
 is used.The yields should be          
 2tons/acre or above and wheat maybe a 
 little more ,but not above 3tons/acre.
 The grain is  used partly for cattle  
 and sheep feed.The straw is not burnt 
 these days ,in fact it can be treated 
 with protein supplement and used as   
 fodder for cows.                      
   As well as being used for grazing   
 the grass is made into hay and silage 
 ideally two thirds for hay and the    
 rest silage.The silage is made into   
 big round bales and packed into black 
 plastic bags.Again a contractor comes 
 in with a big baler when the grass is 
 ready.The cost per bale is Â£2.20.     </content>
