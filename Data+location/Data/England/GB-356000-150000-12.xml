		<content>    The Mendips is an area of hills and
 steeply cut valleys, where dairy      
 farming predominates. Long ago it was 
 largely forested but it is now a      
 patchwork quilt of fields. Boundarys  
 are marked by hedges, barbed wire     
 fences, and traditional Mendip dry    
 stone walls.                          
    Because the Mendip stone is lime,  
 only lime loving plants survive. These
 plants provide a suitable habitat for 
 many small creatures.                 
    During the spring months the Mendip
 hills produce a carpet of gay and     
 fragrant flowers which brighten up the
 dull and uninviting hedgerows.        
    Woodland on the Mendips are a      
 pleasure to walk through as in some   
 hot summers the woods stay quite cool,
 and in winter the coniferous woodlands
 also provide a warm and sheltered     
 habitat for many woodland creatures.  </content>
