  The Victoria viaduct is made of brick
 and is about 150 years old.We estimate
 that it is 30 metres high and 400     
 metres long.It has nine arches and was
 built to carry passenger trains.      
{Penshaw Bridge                        
  This bridge is often called Fatfield 
 Bridge.It is made of strengthened     
 steel and has big metal bolts to keep 
 it together.It is the shape of half a 
 circle.                               
{Chatershaugh Bridge                   
  Chatershaugh Bridge is the highway   
 bridge and is made of concrete.It is  
 much newer than the previous two.     
{Footbridges                           
  A pedestrian bridge,also used for    
 light traffic,is found on the Lambton

 and cross the disused railway and the 
 various major roads.                  </content>
