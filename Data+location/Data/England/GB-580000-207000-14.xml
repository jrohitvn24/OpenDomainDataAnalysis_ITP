		<content>    Those parts of Woodham Walter and  
 Ulting which fall within our area have
 no clubs sited there although people  
 belong to some in their villages.     
    At Langford there are several      
 clubs. The Cricket Club is open to all
 but the pitch is owned by the Water   
 Works.There is a village football team
 and a tennis club.The tennis club is  
 private and most members come from    
 outside the village.                  
    There is a social club in the      
 village but many people travel to     
 nearby Maldon to belong to clubs and  
 attend evening classes.
