		<content> THE CORNISH COASTAL FOOTPATH RUNS     
 ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS FROM ST.AGNES TO 
 PERRANPORTH.IT IS STEEP IN PLACES AND 
 VERY STONEY AND WINDY.FROM THE        
 FOOTPATH YOU GET AN EXCELLANT VIEW AND
 ON A GOOD DAY YOU CAN SEE UP THE COAST
 TO NEWQUAY AND TREVOZE HEAD.JUST OFF  
 SHORE ARE TWO ROCKS CALLED MAN AND HIS
 MAN,SOMETIMES CALLED BAWDEN ROCKS.    
 AROUND THE FOOTPATH IS HEATHER AND    
 GORSE AND IN SOME PARTS THE PATH IS   
 ALMOST OVERGROWN.NEAR TREVELLAS PORTH 
 THE PATH IS VERY ROUGH AND COVERED    
 WITH BRAMBLES. THE FOOTPATH PASSES    
 CLOSE AROUND{HANOVER COVE}SO NAMED    
 WHEN A SAILING SHIP WAS WRECKED THERE 
 DURING A STORM.THE ROCKS ARE RICH IN  
 COLOUR AND INLAND,SHEEP AND COWS CAN  
 BE SEEN GRAZING.THE VIEWS ARE         
 BREATHTAKING BUT{BEWARE!}THE CLIFFS   
 ARE HIGH AND DON'T FORGET TO COVER UP 
 WELL ON A WINDY DAY.                  </content>
