		<title>01General Synopsis of the Area</title>
		<content> This area is part of the eastern      
 outskirts of the{City of Coventry. }  
                                       
 Running through it West-East is       
 the A427 main road to Rugby. The main 
 Coventry to London railway line       
 follows the same route. The city      
 boundary runs North-South and cuts the
 area into two distinct parts. Outside 
 the city boundary i.e. the eastern    
 part of the area, it is countryside   
 with a number of small wooded areas,  
 a small dormitory housing estate,a    
 farm and a small part of a much larger
 Country Park called Coombe Abbey.     
 Within the boundary lie dense housing 
 estates, Willenhall to the South,     
 Ernesford Grange, and Binley to the   
 North whilst to the North West,       
 separated by the River Sowe and its   
 wide flood plain are the areas of     
 Wyken and Stoke.                      </content>
