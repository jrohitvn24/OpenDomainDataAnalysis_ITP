		<title>12CROMWELL COTTAGE, TILE HILL</title>
		<content> The age of this cottage is difficult  
 to date but 1653 is marked on the     
 building. It was built in 2 parts, the
 first part being just one room with a 
 dressed window. One theory is that it 
 was a chapel of Eves, which makes     
 sense as it was built in a religious  
 area. The working cottage would have a
 hole in the wall, not a window. The   
 second part would be timber frame and 
 monastic stone. Nowadays the cottage  
 has 3 rooms downstairs, the kitchen   
 with an ancient bread oven, and 3     
 bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. The 
 garden is much smaller now and        
 extremely overgrown. Legend says that 
 Oliver Cromwell hid in a chimney of   
 the cottage but there is no real      
 evidence of this. However, Cromwell's 
 soldiers, attacking Royalists         
 defending the city, may have used the 
 cottage for a night's rest.           </content>
