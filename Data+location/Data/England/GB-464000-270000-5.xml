		<content>7 o'clock and the sound of the milkman 
and his delivery van wakes us up as he 
leaves two pint bottles on the doorstep
Time to get up and washed,dressed and  
have breakfast of cereals and toast.I  
switch on the electric kettle to brew a
pot of tea.The daily newspaper and the 
morning post are delivered,the gas and 
electricity bills. At 8am my husband   
leaves in his car for his office in    
Northampton.The boys get their school  
books ready.Some children are heading  
for the bus stop to wait for the school
bus to Guilsborough.We set off in my   
car to take Paul and Philip to Guils-  
borough Primary school.I return home,  
vacuum the carpets,wash up the dishes  
and put the laundry into the automatic 
washing machine.At 11am I walk down the
road to change our books borrowed from 
the mobile library on its weekly visit.
