		<title>04Lound and its Future</title>
		<content>Lound was described in the Domesday    
Book as a hamlet. Its Viking name Lundr
means "a grove in a plain". Although   
surrounded by farms Lound is no longer 
a farming village. The census returns, 
1951, show 266 adults, half working on 
land and living in rented homes. With  
mechanisation farmers managed with     
less help, this meant that younger     
villagers left to find work. In 1970   
the school, built in 1858, closed      
causing concern. 70 pupils attended    
but only 27 remained on roll. As more  
cottages became derelict, Lord         
Somerleyton,the main landlord,began to 
sell them. With growth of Lowestoft and
Yarmouth, "outsiders" were attracted to
Lound. Estate Agents regard Lound      
cottages as "desirable" homes. The     
newcomers mean Lound is fully occupied 
with neat homes in good repair. Lound's
future seems secure.                   </content>
