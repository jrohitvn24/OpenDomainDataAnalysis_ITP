		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LYNDSEY</title>
		<content>   I get up at about 7.30am.and get my 
 breakfast finished by 8.15am.By 8.30am
 I have all my school things ready and 
 we leave in the car for school at     
 8.40am.School starts at 9.00 am and   
 after assembly our first lesson is    
 maths which lasts until 10.30am.      
 After playtime when we often skip we  
 do P.E. At 12.00 we go to dinner where
 I like having beefburger and chips and
 some fruit.At 1.15 when the bell goes 
 we go in for afternoon school.In the  
 afternoon we have History or Geography
 until 2.30pm when the bell goes for   
 playtime .After that we do some       
 English until 3.30pm when we are      
 allowed to read until 3.45pm when the 
 bell goes for the end of school.I then
 go out of school and wait until my mum
 comes to pick me up.                  
   That is a normal Tuesday at         
 St.Bridgets Primary School.           </content>
