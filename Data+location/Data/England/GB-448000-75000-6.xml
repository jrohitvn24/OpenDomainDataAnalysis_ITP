		<title>06Niton Undercliff_Erosion</title>
		<content> The massive land movements which      
 formed(and still shape)the Undercliff 
 seem to have begun at the end of the  
 last Ice Age.The area from Blackgang  
 to St.Lawrence is unluckily just about
 the most unstable part of it and very 
 large landslips have occurred up to   
 the present time.The main cause of    
 these slips is always the water-      
 logging of the topsoil overlying the  
 impermeable gault clay (blue slipper) 
 by springs rising at the foot of the  
 of the inland cliff.In very wet       
 seasons the land eventually cannot    
 hold the weight of the water and slips
 from the cliff towards the sea.The    
 recent destructive slip at Blackgang  
 shows only too well how the movement  
 starts near the cliff.The erosion of  
 Chale Terrace at the present time     
 shows the commencement of a new chine.
