		<title>12CRAFT FAYRE AT ARBURY HALL</title>
		<content>  Lucy King,aged seven,visited a craft 
 fayre at Arbury Hall.The hall is on   
 the Arbury estate on the outskirts of 
 Nuneaton.It is open for the public to 
 look round at certain times of the    
 year.You enter through the main gate  
 called "Round Towers" in Stoskingford.
 "The stalls were in a tent in the     
 beautiful garden.All the people       
 selling goods were dressed up as if   
 they lived in olden times.People were 
 selling pictures and sweets.A man sold
 stones that were painted with         
 cottages.I bought a head band with a  
 butterfly on the side.Mummy talked to 
 a lady making earrings out of beads.My
 sister bought some bees wax.I liked   
 watching the lady making pictures     
 from dried flowers and the man writing
 on glass.A lot of men in uniform were 
 looking after the house and garden."
