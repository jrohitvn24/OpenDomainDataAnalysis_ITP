 eastern side of the{Bournemouth       
 conurbation. It is about 7miles from

 Bournemouth.To the east is the{New    
{Forest,}some 5 miles away.The town    
 centre is situated between two rivers,
 the{Avon}and the{Stour.}The two rivers
 join in{Christchurch Harbour}before   
 flowing out into the sea.             
 Christchurch's original name was      
{Tweoxneam}which later became{Twynham  
 which means "town between two         
 rivers".The name was said to have     
 changed when the{Priory Church        
 was built.The town centre has many    
 shops, including a new precinct called
{Saxon Square}which was built on the   
 site of an old settlement. Tourism is 
 important, with many attractions      
 including a castle and local beaches.
