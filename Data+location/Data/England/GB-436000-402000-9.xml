		<content> GROWN UPS ARE ALWAYS TELLING US THAT  
 SO FAR AS CLOTHES ARE CONCERNED WE    
 CHILDREN HAVE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD.   
 WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG MONEY WASN'T AS  
 PLENTIFUL AND THEIR CHOICE OF CLOTHES 
 WAS RESTRICTED. IN FACT, THEY HAD TO  
 WEAR SCHOOL UNIFORMS AND THEY ALSO HAD
 A BEST OUTFIT AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD 
 THEY WERE WORN UP AS PLAYING OUT      
 CLOTHES. NOWADAYS, IN OUR SCHOOL, OUT 
 OF A TOTAL OF 1O8 GIRLS 68 PREFERRED  
 TO WEAR TROUSER IN WINTER; 89 'T'     
 SHIRTS; 5O DRESSES TO SHIRTS AND 'T'  
 SHIRTS IN SUMMER; 49 CHANGED INTO     
 OLDER CLOTHES WHEN PLAYING OUT; 42    
 PREFERRED SOCKS TO TIGHTS; 44 SANDALS 
 TO SHOES IN SUMMER; 45 WORE BEST      
 OUTFITS AT 'DISCOS'; AND 48 HAD HAD   
 THEIR EARS PIERCED.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
