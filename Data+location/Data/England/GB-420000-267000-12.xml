		<title>12HOUSING IN THE SHREWLEY AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
Shrewley area is not densely housed but
properties are well preserved.         
90% of all houses are owner occupied,  
while less than 4% are owned by the    
District Council.                      
Some of the houses have been renovated 
up to a very high standard.            
In other parts of Shrewley the houses  
are quite large averaging at least four
bedrooms.                              
Prices are high for the Midlands area.A
3 bedroom semi-detached will cost about
#47,000.                               
Out towards the northern part of Shrew-
ley, one tends to find only farms and  
public houses.                         
There is some concern about the number 
of new houses gradually being built.   
Each new house helps destroy the small 
community atmosphere.
