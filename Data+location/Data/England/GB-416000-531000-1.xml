		<title>01OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content>   Our D-block is a rural area.We have 
 four  villages in the D-block,one     
 large village called Howden,Hunwick, a
 medium village and two smaller ones,  
 High Grange and North Bitchburn.The   
 block is covered mainly with farmland 
 - mostly grass.The River Wear just    
 touches the edge of the block.There   
 are quite a few farms &amp; farmshouses   
 and the main Bp.Auckland-Crook        
 &amp;Bp.Auckland-Willington roads.The     
 villages grew up when coal was        
 discovered in the 19th Century.Thus   
 most of the houses are terraced,built 
 for the miners.The mines had all      
 closed by 1940 and as there is little 
 industry,most people have to travel to
 the nearby towns for work,as they do  
 to visit cinemas,theatres,sports      
 centres,shops and banks.
