		<content>  There is only one state run{Nursery,}
 situated on the East Side of Whitby   
 which takes children aged 3 to 5      
 years.There are 5 town{Primary Schools
 which admit children up to the age of 
 eleven.The natural division of Whitby 
 by the River Esk determines the       
 secondary school that children attend 
 when they leave their primary school. 
 East Whitby is served by{Eskdale      
{School}and West Whitby by{Caedmon     
{School.}Both are 11 to 14             
 comprehensives. 14 out of town schools
 also feed into one of the two         
 comprehensives.Entrance to{Whitby     
{School}occurs when pupils leave the   
 comprehensives.The leaving age is 16+.
  All{higher education}has to be sought
 outside the area.Children with special
 needs have to travel to Scarborough.
