		<title>11SOCIAL CONCERNS: The Bins</title>
		<content>   When Bury Metropolitan Borough      
 Council considered the new refuse     
 collection system,they had two main   
 aims:- (1) To provide a more efficient
 and effective service,and (2) To make 
 economies in local authority          
 expenditure.                          
   The introduction of the 'wheelie    
 bins' would achieve a more efficient  
 and effective service but would cost a
 great deal of money.The new system    
 requires fewer crew members on refuse 
 collection vehicles, therefore savings
 could be made.The savings would pay   
 for the bins and vehicles within a few
 years.Further,the 'wheelie bins' are  
 lifted hydraulically by the refuse    
 vehicle which reduces the risk        
 of industrial injury.                 
   The trial period in Brandlesholme   
 was so succesful,the Council decided  
 to introduce the system across Bury.  </content>
