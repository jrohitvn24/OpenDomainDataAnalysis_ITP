		<content>  In the "Bury Free Press", Friday 5th 
July 1985, the main article was on a   
campaign by a Liberal councillor for   
the withdrawal of hollow chocolate eggs
containing small toys on which a child 
in Ireland choked to death.            
  A local minister appealed at the     
funeral of an unknown baby for the     
parents to come forward. This story has
been running for several weeks. Also on
the front page was an account of a Bury
father rescuing his two children from  
their blazing bedroom and a photograph 
and account of the retirement of the   
publicans of the Railway Hotel.        
  Prominent on the inner pages was the 
celebration of Sir Eldon Griffiths'    
21st year in Parliament.               
On the letters' page the two main      
topics were spiritualism and pre-school
education.                             
                                       </content>
