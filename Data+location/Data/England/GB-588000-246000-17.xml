		<content>Primary area is devoted to production  
of cereal crops coupled with an area of
intensive animal rearing. This consists
of Friesian steers numbering between   
500 and 600. The animals are bought in 
at about 12 weeks and sold at 11       
months. The main cattle market is at   
Bury St. Edmunds. Breeding herds of    
pigs are also reared, the weaners sold 
at 12 weeks in Bury Market. The steers 
are fed on a diet of compound cereals  
and housed in purpose built units      
geared for the production of quality   
beef. The pigs are fed on a compound   
ration and housed in the same fashion. 
EEC Rules &amp; Regulations have curtailed 
to some extent the sale of the beef and
pork, as has the change in eating      
habits of the population who buy less  
meat and more wholefoods.
