		<title>08St.Margaret's Church History</title>
		<content> St Margaret's Church at Carsington is 
 of 12th century origin,but originally 
 it church was probably wooden.The     
 first stone building was erected in   
 1325 and rebuilt in 1648 repaired and 
 reroofed in 1854.In 1873 the box pews 
 were replaced with pine benches and   
 wood from the box pews used as        
 panelling around the walls.A porch was
 also built at this time.A parish had a
 rectory and its own Rector until an   
 order in council dated 11th May 1922  
 approved a scheme for union of of the 
 benifice of Carsington (being a       
 rectory ) and the benifice (being a   
 vicarage) of Wirksworth.The Reverend  
 Herbet Ham being the then incumbant of
 the United Benifice. During the 1939- 
 45 war,for the sake of convenience,   
 Carsington was temporairiy, under the 
 incumbency of the vicar of Brassington
 ,reverting again to Wirksworth in 1951</content>
