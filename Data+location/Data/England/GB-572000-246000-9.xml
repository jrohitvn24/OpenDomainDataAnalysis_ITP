Though a small village Hundon has      
numerouis recreational activities      
organised for all ages from "toddlers" 
to the elderly.                        
  The main centre for these activities 
is the Village Hall which was built    
shortly after the second world war with
money donated or raised locally. The   
building was erected by work parties of
young people from abroad under the     
supervision of Mr. Russel Howes of     
Mount  Pleasant.                       
  There are three fields for outdoor   
activities. One is administered by the 
Parish Council and the other by the    
Hundon Foundation Trust. The third     
field is owned by Suffolk Education    
Authority for the erection of a        
replacement school for the village     
though it looks unlikely that the      
school will ever be erected.           </content>
