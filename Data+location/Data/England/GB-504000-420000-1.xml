		<content> The village is in the midst of an     
 agricultural region and is located 1  
 mile from the River Humber.In earlier 
 times St.Chad built a "house" (no     
 trace today) nearby and John Harrison 
 (inventor of the ships chronometer)   
 lived here. The decline over the last 
 10 years, of the local industry has   
 brought its associated problems in    
 terms of employment; many women work  
 on the land during the agricultural   
 seasons, whilst the men travel to the 
 industrial sites of Killingholme. The 
 village has become more residential in
 character although very little is     
 provided in terms of entertainment and
 public transport. The Barclay Survey  
 (1978) saw the development of a Linear
 Town of which Barrow would have played
 no small part, but the Humber Bridge  
 Toll and the estimated decline in     
 the birth rate, have delayed this.    </content>
