Bars and bulldog are the most popular. 
BULLDOG:You need a lot of people in a  
line. One is in the middle, a little   
way away, facing them. He calls a      
name, that person shouts "bulldog" and 
runs at the person. All the others     
chase. If he catches any of them they  
stay with him. He must catch the one   
whose name he called first.
