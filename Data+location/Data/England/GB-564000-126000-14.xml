		<title>14The Year of the Sheep Farmer</title>
		<content> The year starts in the autumn with the
 ewe having her feet trimmed to avoid  
 foot rot,the wool around the posterior
 trimmed,an injection for certain      
 diseases and medicine for worms.During
 October and November the ewes are put 
 to the ram.Six weeks before lambing,  
 the ewes are given extra food to build
 up their strength and produce milk for
 the offspring.The lambs are born in   
 March and April,and lambing lasts     
 about 3 weeks.Usually the ewes do not 
 need any help,but sometimes manual    
 assistance is given.The lambs stay    
 with the ewes for 4 months.During the 
 summer the ewes are shorn and the wool
 sold.Sheep and lambs are dipped in a  
 chemical to stop bluebottles laying   
 eggs which would hatch into maggots in
 the sheep's wool.The lambs are sold   
 for meat at 5 months.In autumn the    
 cycle starts again.                   </content>
