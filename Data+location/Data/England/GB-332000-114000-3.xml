		<title>03BROADWAY CHURCH</title>
		<content> Broadway church is \ a mile North of  
 the village, because the original     
 homes were abandoned because of the   
 plagues in 1593-1609 and again in     
 1666-1667.Some of the stones of these 
 houses were used to build houses in   
 the new village of Broadway which grew
 up after the plagues.                 
    Originally there was a wooden Saxon
 church,and the church is dedicated to 
 2 Saxon saints,but the earliest       
 features of the present hamstone      
 church are of the 13th century;the    
 Chancel and Transepts. The Nave and   
 Tower are of the 15th century.The     
 Tower has a set of 5 bells,the oldest 
 bell is dated 1583A.D. The black oak  
 pulpit and the stone font are probably
 both of the 15th century.             
    Broadway church choir has 8 people.
 There is a service weekly,mornings and
 evenings alternately.                 </content>
