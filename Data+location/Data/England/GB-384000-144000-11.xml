		<title>11THE "WARMINSTER JOURNAL"</title>
		<content> For a town of 15000 people, Warminster
 is unusual and lucky to have its own  
 local newspaper, the "Warminster      
 Journal", founded in 1881 and still   
 run as a family business from Coates  
 and Parkers shop. Surprisingly, this  
 was not the first paper in the town,  
 which had a monthly "Miscellany" even 
 in the 1850s. In 1985 it takes only 11
 full-time workers to produce the      
 "Journal". The editor is Mrs Gladys   
 Shorto. News is collected by the      
 paper's sole reporter, award-winning  
 journalist Mr Kevin Mount. Printing   
 starts every Tuesday and ends by      
 Thursday afternoon when about 5600    
 copies are distributed throughout the 
 surrounding area. As for the future,  
 Mr Mount thinks computers will be used
 increasingly to produce the paper more
 efficiently and help the "Journal"    
 survive its second century.           </content>
