		<title>02EDGEFIELD GREEN &amp; STREET</title>
		<content> Edgefield is a village which has      
 spread over a considerable area. There
 is a concentration of housing round   
 the village green and on both sides of
 the road between Holt and Saxthorpe,  
 and another grouping about a mile away
 at The Street, sometimes called       
 Ramsgate Street (an indication of the 
 early importance of sheepfarming). The
 history of the village reveals        
 rivalries between the two areas and   
 there seems to have been great social 
 disparity. Even now, when cottages    
 have been restored and put together to
 make larger homes, it is clear that   
 some at The Street must have been very
 tiny. The church was moved nearer to  
 the population about 100 years ago,but
 it is still on the edge of the        
 community, accessible to both Green   
 and Street. The shop and the pub are  
 both in Edgefield Green.              </content>
