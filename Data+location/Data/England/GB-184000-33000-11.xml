		<content> The coach company also provides       
 transport for local school children   
 travelling out of the area to the     
 nearest comprehensive school at       
 Tregony,about ten miles away.         
{Taxi Services.}                       
 The only other speedy means of        
 transport around the area is by taxi. 
 Comparing the size of population with 
 the number of taxi services,this seems
 to be the only area of transport that 
 is thriving.                          
 There are four taxi services operating
 in the area.One of these operates from
 the Gerrans district and the other    
 three from St.Mawes.Of the three      
 St.Mawes taxi services,one has only   
 recently begun operating.Besides the  
 transporting of the general public,   
 some of the taxi services are under   
 contract to take children to the local
 primary schools from outlying areas.  </content>
