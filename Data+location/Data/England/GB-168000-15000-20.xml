		<content> I asked the children in our class what
 they liked and disliked about living  
 in this area. Most of the children    
 like living here.They like the        
 peacefulness and fresh air of the     
 countryside and living near the       
 beaches.They can play in the fields.  
 Many children like the school         
 dinners. We have things like meat pie,
 chips, roast chicken,custard eclairs, 
 meringues.                            
 A lot of children do not like the     
 holidaymakers in the area because they
 think they drive around much too      
 fast.They nickname them "emmets" which
 means ants.Some children do not like  
 the smells from the farmyards and some
 children have no dislikes at all.
