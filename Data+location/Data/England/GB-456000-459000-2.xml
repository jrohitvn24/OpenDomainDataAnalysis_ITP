		<title>02LAUND HOUSE FARM</title>
		<content> All fields in the area are surrounded 
 by well established hedges, and in    
 some places quite mature deciduous    
 trees are growing. About 70% of the   
 area is cultivated. Crops grown this  
 year include barley and wheat. A few  
 fields have already been ploughed in  
 preparation for the sowing of winter  
 corn. 30% of the area is pasture land 
 for grazing cattle.                   
 A small stream runs east-west across  
 the area. There is one farm in the    
 area. It is called Laund House Farm.  
 Although the farmhouse itself is      
 empty, the farm foreman lives in a    
 caravan on the site. He told us that  
 he had worked 35 years for the same   
 employer, as stockman. The farmhouse  
 was condemned ten years ago, and is   
 due to bedemolished very soon. There  
 are plans for a new house to be       
 constructed on the same site.         </content>
