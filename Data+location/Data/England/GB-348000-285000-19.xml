		<content>   We did a traffic survey on the 21st 
 May between 1.15 and 2.15pm of the    
 B4368 road from{Craven Arms/Ludlow}to{
{Bridgnorth/Much Wenlock.}We counted   
 vehicles in both directions. After one
 hour the two results were almost the  
 same. Altogether we counted 144 Cars, 
 22 lorries, 19 Vans and only 2        
 bicycles and one motorbike .          
   There is very little public         
 transport up and down the             
 Corvedale.There is a bus Monday to    
 Friday run by Boultons which takes    
 children to{Ludlow}from the Corvedale 
 and returns at 4.15pm.The public are  
 allowed to use this bus.On Saturday   
 Midland Red run a bus between{        
{Ludlow}and{Bridgnorth.}               
   There is one garage in our D-Block.{
