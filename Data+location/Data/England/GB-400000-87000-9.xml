		<content> St. Mary's Anglican Church was erected
 by Colonel Petrie Waugh, when he      
 bought the island in 1852. It is in   
 the diocese of Salisbury.             
 The church itself is made of Purbeck  
 stone and has a small graveyard at the
 rear.The interior of the church is    
 fairly detailed with a chancel, a     
 vestry, a nave and a family pew under 
 the Tower.The tower contains eight    
 bells recast from the original four,  
 and each one is named after a         
 particular person connected with the  
 island.                               
 The church has much fine workmanship. 
 Two well-wrought screens divide the   
 nave from the chancel.An unusual      
 feature is the fireplace in the family
 pew, which has a Flemish picture over 
 it.The church contains many works of  
 art from Italy.
