		<title>14A VIEW OF SIDDINGTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Siddington is not one of those pretty 
 Cotswold Villages loved by the tourist
 rather a loose collection of small    
 houses in every style of building,from
 the 15th to 20th centuries.The two or 
 three larger houses are occupied by   
 "incomers".Once there were two        
 villages Upper and lower Siddington   
 each with its own church,each guarding
 its identity.Now one Siddington is    
 almost a suburb of Cirencester,united 
 in its resolution to stay a village.It
 has a church,school,Village-Hall,shop,
 pub,playing field and post office.It  
 has a large working-class population, 
 but few work here since farming uses  
 machines instead of men.Living in     
 Siddington is like being in a large   
 family.Some of the people have lived  
 here in their forefathers for many    
 generations.They know,help and respect
 each other.                           </content>
