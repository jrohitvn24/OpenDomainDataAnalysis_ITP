		<content> This area is mainly used for          
 farming,the land on the valley floor  
 being high quality farming land.Here  
 the river Exe meanders through a flat 
 flood plain between the the sides of  
 the valley.The fields are             
 large,hedgerows having been           
 removed,along with trees,to accomodate
 modern farming methods.Some attempts  
 are being made to restore trees in the
 remaining banks and hedgerows.        
 To east and west of the block the land
 rises,and the undulating surface has  
 smaller fields and more trees.In these
 areas there are copses and an orchard.
 Within this block there is a marked   
 contrast between the low and the high 
 ground.
