		<content> Wales Junior &amp; Infant School is housed
 in three separate buildings, two of   
 which are l09 years old. The third is 
 twenty four years old. One building is
 for the infant children and has two   
 classrooms. The infant age range is   
 4-7 years.                            
       The junior children are split   
 between two buildings, with the first 
 years alone in the building which also
 contains the hall. The older junior   
 have classrooms in the 'new' building.
       We now have just six classes    
 altogether; two infant &amp; four junior. 
 There are l54 children in the school, 
 making an average of about 25 in each 
 class. There are six teachers, the    
 headmaster,the secretary, a non-      
 teaching assistant, a cleaner &amp; a     
 caretaker who has been here for 27    
 years and is retiring at the end of   
 this school year.                     </content>
