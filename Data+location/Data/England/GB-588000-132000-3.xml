		<content> Mr.Weaver became our new headmaster in
 January 1985. To mark the occasion we 
 planted a tree in the school grounds. 
 David Bellamy had started a nationwide
 scheme whereby schools could obtain   
 Elm trees for planting. These trees   
 were produced in Canada and are       
 resistant to Dutch Elm disease which  
 has killed many British Elm trees over
 the  last ten years. All the school   
 assembled on the patch of grass at the
 front of the school building and each 
 teacher arrived in their wellies      
 (wellingtons) carrying a spade over   
 their shoulder. A hole was dug and the
 tree put in. Then Mr Weaver and all   
 the staff, assisted by some of the    
 younger and older children filled in  
 the hole. Rev.Evans, the vicar, helped
 firm it down then he took a short     
 assembly. We sang our hymn and        
 returned to work as usual.            </content>
