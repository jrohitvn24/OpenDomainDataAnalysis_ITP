		<title>17COGGESHALL SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> The Coggeshall  sewage works was built
 in 1979. It is all computer run and   
 only two men come in once a month to  
 see if it is all working. The sewage  
 comes in from Kelvedon, Coggeshall,   
 and  Coggeshall Hamlet. It comes from 
 industrial waste and domestic waste.  
 First it comes through the three pipes
 one from Kelvedon, one from Coggeshall
 and one from Coggeshall Hamlet.       
 Preliminary treatment is when the     
 sewage comes through the pipes and in 
 to the screening process which removes
 rags it then goes into the tanks which
 removes all the grit and it goes      
 through some pipes and into a hopper. 
 Primary treatment removes the sludge  
 into large sludge tanks which are 4   
 metres deep. In the secondary         
 treatment water spreads out and cleans
 up the sewage ready to re-enter the   
 river.                                </content>
