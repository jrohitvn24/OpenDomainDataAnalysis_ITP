		<title>17Breakdancing in Buntingford</title>
		<content> The fashion for breakdancing came from
 America a few years ago and has become
 popular in the Buntingford area as in 
 most other parts of the country.      
  Breakdancing contains elements from  
 several older kinds of dance,         
 including tribal dances and Cossack   
 dancing. Mostly the boys do           
 breakdancing, although some girls also
 enjoy it.                             
  Breakdancing is a kind of display and
 is quite aggressive. Rival dancers and
 groups will hold a "Burn", dancing in 
 turn and then challenging the next    
 person to do better. Dancers are      
 usually smartly dressed and a sort of 
 uniform has developed.                
  Most boys from the age of about 12   
 follow a group of "breakers". There is
 strong rivalry between groups and     
 within them.
