		<title>14Woolley Scout Camp</title>
		<content> On May 30th we visited Woolley camp   
 site. It was built in 1962 and the    
 land cost Â£650. Over 3,000 cubs and   
 scouts camp there every year. I camped
 there with Newmillerdam cub pack. When
 everyone was there Akele blew the     
 whistle twice and we all ran to her.  
 She said you can explore the woods,   
 so we went to the top. I went with    
 Alexander and Matthew. When Akele blew
 the whistle again we all had to run   
 down. Then we had a game of football. 
 At ten we got our beds out but we     
 didn't get to sleep till 2.30 and we  
 woke up at five.At five past seven we 
 had a drink of tea and got dressed.In 
 the day we did some work for a badge. 
 Our team won the trophy.
