		<content> The only major industrial concern in  
 our block is a firm known as Hoechst. 
 This company occupies a large building
 on the eastern side of East Winch     
 called the Hall. Itis surrounded by   
 very well kept grounds extending to   
 several acres.                        
 Hoechst is an international chemical  
 company which produces pharmaceutical 
 products,fibres, plastics, dyes,      
 vetinary products and reprographics,  
 but the Hall is mainly concerned with 
 the development of agricultural       
 chemicals.                            
 The company's work in East Winch is   
 based on high technology and employs  
 comparatively few people. Consequently
 very few local people are employed at 
 the Hall.                             
 The other industrial enterprise is a  
 battery turkey farm to the north of   
 East Winch.                           </content>
