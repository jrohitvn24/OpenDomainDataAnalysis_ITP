		<title>16LAPPET MILL AT CALDER VALE</title>
		<content> In the middle of the village, next to 
 the river is Lappet Mill.             
 About a hundred and fifty  people     
 work in the mill. They make shawls for
 the Arabs.                            
 They are sent to Scotland to be       
 finished, then to Saudi Arabia.       
 The mill has four storeys and was     
 built in 1835 with local stone, and   
 has wooden floors.                    
 Many of the people who work in the    
 mill come from Garstang and Preston   
 but there are also many from Calder   
 Vale  itself.                         
 The mill is busy 24 hours per day, 7  
 days a week.                          
 There are three shifts, 6am-2pm,      
 2pm-10pm, 10pm-6am. At weekends, there
 are two shifts of 12 hours each:      
 6am-6pm, 6pm-6am.                     
 Once privately owned, it is now part  
 of the Courtauld company.             </content>
