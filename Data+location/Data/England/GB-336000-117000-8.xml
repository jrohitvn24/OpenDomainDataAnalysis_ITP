 settlements.Most are old but there    
 are some modern buildings.In          
 Barrington many houses date from the  
 15th.century.The oldest are thatched &amp;
 made of cob stones.Others are made of 
 stone &amp; some of brick.The South       
 Somerset District Council state that  
 all new housing must be made of stone.
 This is concrete made from pieces of  
 real stone.Some dwellings are         
 bungalows &amp; 3 are converted barns.
