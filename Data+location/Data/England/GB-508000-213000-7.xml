 has 5 acres of land and was           
 established 20 years ago, it was a    
 poultry farm before this. The centre  
 employs 3 people but an extra         
 part_time help is employed at         
 weekends.                             
                                       
 4{ HORSES}_ Most farmers in the area  
 keep 1 or more horses, mainly for     
 riding.  There is one riding stable in
 the area _ Harpendenbury which has    
 stables, a school and grazing fields. 
 The horses are ridden along local     
 bridleways and gallops can be taken on
 Kinsbourne Green Common only a mile   
 from the stable.
