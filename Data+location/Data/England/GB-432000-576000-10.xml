		<title>10The Vicar (continued)</title>
		<content> Pauls.  Behind Beresford road stands a
 Methodist chapel. There is only one   
 resident clergyman of any denomination
 Mr Fenwick is Seaton Sluice's clergy- 
 man.There is a Roman priest who lives 
 in New Hartley.Mr Fenwick had lived in
 an old vicarage which was 25O years   
 old until 1983 when a new vicarage was
 built next door. The reason for this  
 was that the old vicarage was huge and
 most of it stood empty. Lord Hastings 
 gave the original vicarage to the     
 parish in 1891.                       
   In 1984, 21 weddings took place at  
 the church, most of them were held at 
 the parish. It was very rare to get a 
 wedding at St Micheals. 16 baptisms   
 took place and all of them were       
 infant. 34 funerals took place a in   
 the church.                           
   In the Middle Ages most churches    
 were dedicated to the{Virgin Mary.    </content>
