		<title>11My gran talks about Wetheral</title>
		<content>   I spoke to my gran about Wetheral.  
 The old village of Wetheral was quite 
 small with a triangular green in the  
 middle. The houses were mainly large, 
 built from the local red sandstone and
 occupied by doctors and lawyers.People
 wanted to live in this lovely village 
 with its fine old church.             
   My gran's house was built in 1780   
 and it used to be a public house.     
   When she first came to the village  
 she knew all the people but when the  
 large new housing estates were built  
 the community spirit disappeared.The  
 village grew most quickly in the      
 1970's and these new houses were      
 bought by people who would work in    
 Carlisle.She says that most houses are
 owned by the people who live in them  
 and as far as she knows there is      
 no-one out of work in the village.
