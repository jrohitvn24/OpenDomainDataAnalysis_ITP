		<title>19WETHERBY CUSTODY CENTRE</title>
		<content>{ The Youth Custody Centre}is for      
 people aged between 18-21. The people 
 there are those who find it difficult 
 to cope with social pressures.  The   
 boys stay between 9 months and 4      
 years. How long they stay depends on  
 their crime. They are there to try and
 get rid of their bad habits. When they
 stay there they learn skills such as  
 woodwork, gardening etc. If they work 
 very hard they can earn as much as    
 five pounds a week. Although some work
 very hard they have very little chance
 of a job when they leave.             
                                       
  Before it was the Youth Custody      
 Centre it was a{borstal}and before    
 that it belonged to the{Royal Navy.   
 The site will change into a{secure    
{youth custody unit}during the next few
 years.
