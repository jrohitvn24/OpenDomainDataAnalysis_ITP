		<title>12ENTERTAINMENT IN TADLEY</title>
		<content> Tadley has a small old fashioned      
 cinema, run on a voluntary basis,     
 which shows a mixture of slightly blue
 films, cartoons and the occasional    
 major feature. There are no theatres, 
 disco's or nightclubs, for those you  
 must go elsewhere. Most entertainment 
 is of the self-made kind, there are   
 many events organised by local groups 
 such as Parent Teacher Associations,  
 political parties, Scout or Cub Packs 
 and WI's, in Church and Parish Halls. 
 They include Barn dances, barbecues   
 and disco's. There are also local     
 operatic, dramatic and musical        
 societies who provide shows for all   
 tastes. However, as in most towns and 
 villages, many people are quite       
 content to stay at home and watch     
 television, or at the most go to the  
 local pub for the evening.
