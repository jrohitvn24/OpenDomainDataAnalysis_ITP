		<title>09Bexhill-History of Tourism 2</title>
		<content> As airlines like BOAC grew, Bexhill   
 slowly deteriorated. So grew the      
 saying that people come to Bexhill to 
 die, and Bexhill lost its{tourist     
{industry.}Now all that is left are a  
 few small hotels, guest houses and    
 bed &amp; breakfast places. Those hotels  
 left do very well. Now, in 1985, the  
{day tripper}has taken over. The day   
 tripper brings his own food to spend a
 day on the{beach.}These people are bad
 for the industry as they spend very   
 little.                               
 Another tourist industry has grown up 
 over the past few years. The{foreign  
{students}have arrived in their        
 thousands. They spend money and buy   
 goods unlike the day tripper but stay 
 in peoples private houses unlike the  
 real holidaymaker.
