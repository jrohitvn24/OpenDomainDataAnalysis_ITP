		<content>   Walking upwards ,bracken still      
 grows but also with nettles and       
 moss. We are now at 1175ft and granite
 has become exposed at the surface.    
 Bracken has now lessened but there is 
 an abundance of many different kinds  
 of mosses.As the walk proceeds,       
 vegetation cover increases and both   
 mosses and bracken are abundant .At   
 1230ft, bracken is again the main     
 vegetation cover,but also granite is  
 becoming more and more exposed.       
  Further up, between 1275-1290 ft.    
 granite becomes increasingly exposed, 
 accompanied with bracken, moss and    
 various sorts of lichen. At this      
 height one  woodpigeon was sighted.   
  Near the summit of Sharpitor granite 
 took over the landscape. The top of   
 Sharpitor is 1325 ft. The tor is      
 heavily weathered and the vegetation  
 is sparse.                            </content>
