		<content> The following information was         
 supplied by the{Rev. Geoffrey         
{Fraser,Vicar of Uffculme Parish       
{Church.}The earliest existing section 
 was built in the{13th century.}In the 
{15th century}this was extended to     
 make the building lighter and larger. 
 However the more slender pillars began
 to lean and this can be clearly seen  
 with the heavier original pillars     
 still adding support in places. In    
{1840}the church was extended sidewards
 and the tower was replaced with a     
{spire.}The{oak rood screen dating from
{1450}was added to and renovated in the
{1840's}by{John Marker}who also added  
 the spire etc.He is buried in a       
 vault in the church and his initials  
 can be seen on the weather cock.The   
 Church attendance is about 100 each   
 week.Services are held on Sunday and  
 there is also much community use.     </content>
