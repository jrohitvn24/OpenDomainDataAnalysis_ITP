		<content>   Customs in the Forest of Dean. Sheep
 Badgers.Visitors to the forest are    
 surprised to see road signs warning of
 straying sheep. This custom has been  
 questioned and opposed more in recent 
 years with the increased road         
 traffic.Persons born in the Forest can
 claim the right to graze sheep on the 
 waste ground and grass verges of the  
 roads. Permission has to be obtained  
 from the Forestery Commission which is
 attempting to regulate the number of  
 Badgers (owners)and number of sheep   
 kept .                                
 Carnivals.The custom of holding an    
 annual carnival has been revived in   
 many towns and villages in recent     
 years.A procession with marching      
 bands, decorated floats and walkers   
 usually start the                     
 proceedings.Cinderford probably       
 holds the largest of these events.    </content>
