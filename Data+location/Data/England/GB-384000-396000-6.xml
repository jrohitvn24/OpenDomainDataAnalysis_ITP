		<title>06Industry in Manchester</title>
		<content>  This area containing part of the city
 centre and the area to the immediate  
 east is dominated by a wide range of  
 industrial activities.                
  Much of the development took place in
 the nineteenth century, particularly  
 textile (cotton) mills and their      
 associated functions. Many of the     
 larger Victorian buildings on the edge
 of the city centre were large         
 warehouses built to store the textile 
 products destined for a world export  
 market through Manchester docks.      
  Decline of these activities has led  
 to a more varied pattern and the      
 demands of the city centre now        
 predominate. Major activities are     
 concerned with distribution, printing,
 office needs and car servicing and    
 repair. Many small enterprises operate
 from converted cotton mills. Post-war 
 development of unified ind. estates.  </content>
