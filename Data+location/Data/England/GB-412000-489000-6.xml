		<content> THERE ARE TWO VILLAGES IN THIS AREA,  
 HARMBY AND SPENNITHORNE.THE HOUSES ARE
 A MIXTURE OF OLD AND NEW.HARMBY IS THE
 BIGGER VILLAGE WITH A LARGE ESTATE OF 
 MODERN BUNGALOWS.THERE ARE POST-WAR   
 COUNCIL HOUSES IN BOTH VILLAGES.      
 NEARLY EVERYBODY HAS A CAR.MOST PEOPLE
 HAVE MODERN ELECTRICAL HOME           
 APPLIANCES SUCH AS TELEVISIONS,       
 DISHWASHERS, AUTOMATIC WASHING        
 MACHINES AND VIDEOS.FRIDGES AND       
 FREEZERS ARE ALMOST ESSENTIAL BECAUSE 
 OF THE LACK OF SHOPS.PEOPLE ON THE    
 WHOLE LIVE VERY COMFORTABLY.MANY OF   
 THE POPULATION ARE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE
 AND RETIRED PEOPLE.EVERYONE SEEMS TO  
 BE FINANCALLY SECURE JUDGING FROM THE 
 NEAT APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES.PEOPLE  
 COME FROM A WIDE RANGE OF BACKGROUNDS,
 FROM WORKING CLASS TO LANDOWNERS WHO  
 STILL HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE.
