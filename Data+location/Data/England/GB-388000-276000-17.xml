		<content> The farms in the area average 100     
 acres. The soil is sandy and easily   
 worked. Sugar beet is grown for       
 processing at the Kidderminster       
 factory and grain is sold to local    
 merchants. An increasing trend is to  
 grow fruit and vegetables for sale    
 locally. At one time, these crops were
 harvested by casual workers and sent  
 to local markets but now they are sold
 on a 'pick your own' basis to the     
 consumers themselves. People enjoy    
 buying produce in this way as they are
 cheaper than in the shops, you can    
 select the best and they couldn't be  
 fresher. Many crops are offered       
 including beans, onions, sweetcorn,   
 greens, root crops, strawberries and  
 other soft fruit and apples and pears.
 Many farms offer facilities for       
 picnics so families can make it a day 
 out in the country.                   </content>
