		<title>08The School. Middleton. (3)</title>
		<content>  We spoke to the{headmaster}of the    
 school.                               
  He obviously enjoyed teaching at     
 Middleton and he told us that the     
 great advantage from his point of view
 was that he could get to know all the 
 children really well.The children also
 benefitted from a friendly atmosphere 
 with everyone knowing everyone else.  
  The headmaster thought that there    
 were no inherent disadvantages in a   
 small primary school but he did think 
 that many children found it difficult 
 when they transferred to a large      
 secondary school.                     
  The continued existence of a school  
 seems to be important to the          
 continuation of  village facilities.  
 One resident at North Runcton told us 
 that the closing of the school had    
 been the decisive step in the decline 
 of village facilities there.          </content>
