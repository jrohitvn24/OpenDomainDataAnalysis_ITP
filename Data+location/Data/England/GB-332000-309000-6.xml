 I get up in the morning at five past  
 seven. I get dressed and come down    
 stairs to have my breakfast.          
 I watch television for half an hour.  
 I get my things ready for school then 
 go and wait until the taxi comes to   
 take me to school.                    
     When we get to school we have the 
 register marked then we start work. We
 do lots of different things such as   
 swimming,maths,English,theme          
 work,religious education and games.   
     We go home at half past three then
 I usually ride my bike until about    
 four o'clock.I go to watch            
 television and have my tea.           
 I go to bed about half past eight to  
 nine o'clock.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
