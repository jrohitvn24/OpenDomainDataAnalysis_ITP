Only my mum and I are in the house     
during the week as my dad works away   
from home, returning at the weekends.  
My mum gets up at 6:35 - on goes the   
heating and the coffee. I get up at    
about 7:00, dressing in my school      
uniform of blue shirt, blue skirt and  
maroon jumper. My breakfast is usually 
Cheese and Ham Toast-Toppers or muesli.
                                       
I have a quick look at the paper       
before getting a lift to the train     
station with the next door neighbour.  
It takes about fifteen minutes to walk 
from Maidstone Station to Invicta      
Grammar School. On Wednesday's we have 
an early timetable, lessons starting at
9:00 and finishing at 3:15, but on all 
other days we start at 9:15 and finish 
at 3:50.                               
I snack, do my homework,eat, TV &amp; bed. </content>
