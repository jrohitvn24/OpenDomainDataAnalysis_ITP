		<title>13Totternhoe Knolls</title>
		<content> The Knolls over look the village of   
 Totternhoe.  It was once the site of  
 an Iron Age fort and was one of       
 several in the area.  The highest part
 of the Knolls is called Castle Mound. 
 Nearby is a depression in the ground  
 called the Money Pit.  The Knolls are 
 now a haven for local flora and fauna 
 and is supervised by the Beds and     
 Hunts Naturalists Trust.  The area is 
 ideal for picnicing in during the     
 warmer weather.  There is a car park  
 nearby and a signpost to it down on   
 the road which runs through the       
 village.  There are troughs for the   
 animals to drink from and stiles to   
 mark out the rights of way.  Also in  
 this area is the cub hut and the lime 
 kilns.  The local quarry provided the 
 stone for many local churches         
 including Totternhoe and Dunstable.
