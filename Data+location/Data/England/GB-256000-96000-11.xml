		<content> Mr Waddilove  gets up at seven each   
 morning to milk their cow. One of     
 their three children has to get to    
 school in{Exeter}so she leaves at 20  
 to 8. They have bacon and eggs and    
 coffee for breakfast. Milking the cow 
 is the first thing that needs doing   
 but in the winter some animals will   
 need to be fed.Everyone helps on the  
 farm. Ben is old enough to drive the  
 tractor and they can all move the     
 animals round the fields. They all    
 have cooked dinner at one o'clock for 
 it is tradition. All of their food is 
{home produced.}Beef, sheep, chicken,  
 ducks, milk, bread, jam, marmalade,   
 butter and  Mrs Waddilove makes       
{clotted cream.}All the animals are    
 checked each night. The children go   
 for a ride Sunday afternoons and take 
 the 2 dogs with them. On Tuesdays Mr  
 Waddilove goes to{Hatherleigh Market. </content>
