		<title>04QUARRY DISPUTE</title>
		<content>   Residents and parish councillors in 
 Swillington are objecting to a        
 proposed extension of the village     
 brickworks. This would bring the      
 quarry within metres of a local       
 housing estate.                       
   One councillor said,"Swillington has
 had enough of dirt and noise.We have a
 right to breathe fresh air.We have a  
 right to enjoy the Green Belt."       
   The main objections to the proposals
 are:-                                 
  1.Noise, dirt and possible blasting  
 disturbances to housing development.  
  2.Loss of green belt land which could
 be used for agriculture.              
  3.Loss of visual amenity causing a   
 depreciation in the value of nearby   
 houses.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
