		<content> This area is located 5to 6 miles      
 South-East of Huddersfield and        
 approximatetly 20 miles North of      
 Sheffield.                            
     The area is mainly rural with     
 scattered villages and hamlets lying  
 on the Eastern foothills of the       
 Pennines.The three major settlements  
 are New Mill,Shepley and Thurstonland.
     The main Huddersfield-Sheffield   
 Railway Line passes through           
 Shepley,and the area is served by a   
  number of local Bus Companies.       
     There are a number of local       
 industries but the majority of the    
 work force from these villages commute
 to the nearby towns.
