		<content> THERE IS A WATER PUMP IN THE HIGH     
 STREET IN A GARDEN.IT USED TO PUMP    
 WATER FROM A WELL BUT IT IS NOT IN USE
 NOW BUT IT LOOKS O.K.LAURA HAS A WATER
 PUMP IN HER GARDEN BUT IF YOU PUSH    
 DOWN THE HANDLE IT FALLS OFF. NOW WE  
 GET WATER FROM TAPS AND THE WATER     
 COMES THROUGH PIPES AFTER IT HAS      
 CLEANED. IN MOST HOMES THE WATER IS   
 PUMP TO A TANK IN THE ATTIC.WHEN YOU  
 WANT IT YOU TURN ON THE TAP AND THE   
 WATER COMES FROM THE TANK IN TO THE   
 BATHROOM,KITCHEN OR TOILET.THE BIG    
 PIPES ARE UNDER THE ROADS AND SMALL   
 PIPES COME FROM THE BIG ONE CARRYING.
