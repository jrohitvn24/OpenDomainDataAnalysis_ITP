		<title>18LEIGHTON HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>    They began building the hospital in
 1972 and had finished it by the time  
 it was opened by{Queen Elizabeth the  
{Second}in April 1972.  Immediately it 
 was opened the hospital went on       
 strike, and some of the pupils of our 
 school who were born there at that    
 time, were kept in cots covered with  
 paper towels since there were no      
 sheets.                               
    The hospital is a very big place   
 with many corridors and stairs, and   
 there are always lots of people       
 around.  It is painted a sort of      
 creamy colour, and besides the wards, 
 contains a shop where you can buy     
 confectionary.                        
    There are many wards; one for the  
 children, one for elderley patients,  
 and one especially for mentally       
 disturbed patients.  The corridors    
 seem to stretch endlessly on.         </content>
