		<title>19The Farm at Trigon</title>
		<content> There are 550 acres of farmland at    
 Trigon.The farm has 115 dairy cows and
 approximately 180 beef animals.Every  
 cow has one calf a year in the autumn 
 and these are reared for beef.        
               The farm land is mainly 
 grass with some corn and fodderbeet   
 which is grown to feed the cattle.    
     A Day At Trigon by J.Bryant       
 Every morning Di's cockeral wakes me  
 up.Dad has gone to work already.Some  
 mornings Dad has to begin milking at  
 five-o-clock.In June and July they    
 make silage,Les cuts the grass and Dad
 picks it up and puts it into a trailer
 with a forage harvester.Alice and     
 Giles then take it to a silage        
 clamp.When we are making silage the   
 cows are not milked until the         
 evening.Ken does all the milking.     
 When the cows have been mlked and are 
 let out I always hear the calves call.</content>
