		<title>05The Ecology of Gt.Coxwell</title>
		<content> Gt.Coxwell and the surrounding area   
 are lucky to have several footpaths   
 and bridleways.There is also Badbury  
 Clump,which is a National Trust picnic
 area and is used by local people to   
 exercise their dogs.It is a good area 
 for plants,birds and mammals,many of  
 which are common to sandy soil &amp;      
 marshy ground,(Eye-bright,Enchanters  
 Nightshade,Black Poplar etc).There is 
 a carpet of Bluebells in late spring. 
 The whole area,like so many others,has
 been ravaged by Dutch Elm Disease and 
 many old stately elms have had to be  
 felled.The National Trust has replant-
 ed with oak,maple etc.Many field flow-
 ers have been lost through intensive  
 crop spraying &amp; ploughing up to the   
 hedges.The only cowslips now found are
 in the churchyard,which has become a  
 small nature reserve.
