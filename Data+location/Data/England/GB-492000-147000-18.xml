		<title>18GOLD COINS AT WANBOROUGH</title>
		<content> Early in 1985 some{gold and silver    
{coins}were discovered in a field at   
 Wanborough. They were identified as   
 Roman, and declared by the courts to  
 be Treasure Trove.                    
                                       
 Lord Taylor,the owner of the land, has
 hired a guard to protect his fields   
 from looters and treasure hunters who 
 have been discovered digging by       
 moonlight. Nearly a dozen looters have
 been arrested and the police are      
 investigating the incidents.          
                                       
{Archaelogists }say that the field     
 could be the site of a{Roman Temple.  
 Lord Taylor does not want to see his  
 crop of wheat destroyed by the        
 treasure hunters and their metal      
 detectors.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
