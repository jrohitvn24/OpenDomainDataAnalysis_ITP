		<title>17LITTER IN EXMOUTH</title>
		<content> When we were at Sandy Bay we did a    
 litter survey. We found that 28% of   
 the litter was made of plastic and so 
 does not rot or break down. We also   
 found some vegetable waste and glass  
 (60 tons of litter are taken from     
 Sandy Bay Holiday Park each week).    
 There were a lot of cigarette ends.   
 20% of the litter was paper. When we  
 returned to school we did a similar   
 survey in the two playgrounds and the 
 street.50% of the street litter was   
 sweet and cigarette wrappers.The rest 
 was waste paper and cigarette ends.   
 There was hardly any rubbish in the   
 infant's playground because they are  
 not allowed food or sweets at break.  
 Alas there was more litter to be found
 in the junior playground;mostly sweet 
 and crisp wrappers. We found less     
 litter than we expected.
