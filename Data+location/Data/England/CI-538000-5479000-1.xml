		<title>01Herm Island, a general view.</title>
		<content> Herm is an island in the English      
 Channel. It is one of a group of      
 islands that are called the Channel   
 Islands.                              
 The largest island is Jersey, then    
 Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, Herm and    
 Jethou.                               
 Herm is one of the smallest inhabited 
 Channel Islands. About forty people   
 live in Herm.                         
 It is part of the  Bailiwick of       
 Guernsey, governed by the States of   
 Guernsey, and is leased from them by  
 the  present tenant Major Peter       
 Wood.                                 
 Herm is one and a half miles long and 
 half a mile wide and lies three miles 
 off the east coast of Guernsey.       
 The island's economy is based on      
 farming and tourism, for both of which
 it is well suited.
