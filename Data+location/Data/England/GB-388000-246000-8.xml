		<content> Wadborough in general is peaceful and 
 quiet. There used to be a chapel in   
 Wadborough. But it has now been built 
 into a house. Some people wanted to   
 make the chapel house into a village  
 hall. The owner offered it for Â£40.   
 But the people would not take it.     
 There is also a level crossing in     
 Wadborough. There is also a pub called
 the{Masons Arms.}The{Masons Arms}looks
 quite old and has been decorated.     
 There is a post office aswell. You can
 buy stamps and sweets there. Apart    
 from the post office there is no other
 shops in Wadborough. The road with the
 chapel house and the post office and  
 the{Masons Arms}on is called Station  
 Road. The pub sells meals and drinks  
 and sweets.
