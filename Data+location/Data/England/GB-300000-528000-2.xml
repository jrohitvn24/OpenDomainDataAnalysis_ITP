		<title>02SIDDICK POND</title>
		<content> Siddick Nature Reserve became an      
 official reserve in 1981 and is owned 
 by Allerdale District Council.        
 Over 100 different species of birds   
 visit each year, but only 35 species  
 breed there.The rarest breed to appear
 is the Osprey, seen about once per    
 year. The commonest birds are the     
 coots and the starlings.              
 The pond,which is about 10 hectares in
 area,lies in an ancient dried-up bed  
 of the River Derwent, but today is fed
 by Ling Beck. The water temperature   
 depends on the state of the tide.     
 Nearby is Burrow Walls, thought to be 
 the remains of a Roman coastal signal 
 station. It is situated on the top of 
 a high bank, Oyster Bank,a former sea 
 cliff.                                
 The whole site is now overseen by the 
 Nature Conservancy.
