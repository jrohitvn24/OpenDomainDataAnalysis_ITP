		<content> Here are some of the games played by  
 children at school. Tick, Rallyo, Hide
 &amp; Seek, Hot Chocolate, Tunnel Tick,   
 Stuck in the Mud, Rain Snow Thunder   
 Lightning, Duck, Honey, Kingy, Bomb,  
 Queenio Shinio Polish, Hopscotch.     
 Queenio Shinio Polish: one person is  
 on and throws a ball behind their     
 shoulder where the others are         
 standing. If someone catches the ball 
 they shout 'chips'. If it bounces     
 someone gets hold of it behind their  
 back then the person who is on will   
 turn and ask everyone to turn around  
 trying not to let anyone see if they  
 have the ball or not. If the person   
 who is on sees the ball they say "Can 
 I have the ball please", if they see  
 they have not got the ball they say   
 "empty dust bin". If they are right   
 they are on again if they are wrong   
 the one with the ball is on.          </content>
