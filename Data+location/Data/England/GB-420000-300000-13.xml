		<title>13 Linear Park Lakes</title>
		<content> The lakes are situated in the middle  
of Lakeside and Belgrave housing       
estates.                               
 They attract many different birds.    
Coots often nest in the middle of the  
lake with their nests raised up out of 
the water. Moor hens and mallards stay 
close to the fenced off island in the  
middle of the lake.A pair of swans can 
be seen guarding cygnets. The lakes    
even attract seagulls.                 
 Water snails,stickle-backs and frogs  
can be seen in the water and there is  
also a pike which eats baby ducklings. 
Many people have tried to catch the    
pike but it always escapes to the dark 
muddy depths of the lake. The lakes are
a wonderful place for children to play.
