		<title>13Shopping in Barnt Green</title>
		<content>                                       
 We found that most people went once a 
 week to do most of their shopping and 
 that they went to Redditch,           
 Northfield, Bromsgrove and to the     
 village supermarket in Barnt Green.   
 Milk was delivered each morning to    
 over 90% of the population.           
 Fresh produce was bought locally but  
 luxury goods such as clothes, shoes   
 and electrical appliances were        
 purchased from towns nearby.          
 The village garage stopped selling    
 petrol and so everyone has to buy     
 petrol from places such as Rednal or  
 Lickey.                               
 The local shops do a large amount of  
 trade and compete well with shops in  
 the nearby towns.                     
 The local people were very satisfied  
 with the quality and quantity of the  
 local shops.                          </content>
