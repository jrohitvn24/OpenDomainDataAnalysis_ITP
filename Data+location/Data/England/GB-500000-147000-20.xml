		<content>{St Joseph's Church}was the first      
 Catholic church in Guildford since the
 Reformation. It was originally a small
 wooden church in Chertsey Street which
 was rebuilt in stone in 1881. The new 
 church in York Road was built of brick
 in 1984. The statue of St.Joseph and  
 the Holy Child holding a lily, which  
 is the symbol of purity, came from the
 old church.                           
{Christ Church}is the Church of England
 parish church and was built in 1864.  
{St Martha's Church}was built by the   
 Normans between 1100 and 1170 using   
 chalk. The church standing today is   
 80% Victorian and 20% Norman. About 40
 people attend services each week. In  
 one year there are about 5 weddings, 5
 christenings and 8 funerals. The old  
 bell is believed to be in Guildford   
 Town Hall and is now replaced by a    
 smaller one.                          </content>
