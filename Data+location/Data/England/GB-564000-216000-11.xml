		<title>11LIVING IN A PUB.</title>
		<content> This is about my home life.           
 I live in the{Swan pub}in Ford End.   
 We have a cleaner called Daphne and   
 severel other people work for us      
 including Jamie's Mum. she cooks the  
 food with my Mum.                     
 Every Saturday we are allowed to have 
 a sweet and a coke.                   
 It is a{Ridley's}pub.They deliver the 
 beer. It is kept in wooden barrels    
 because the beer tastes better than in
 metal ones. Some of the beer is pumped
 from barrels in the celler though     
 plastic tubes to the bar.The drink    
 that we sell most is beer.            
 Dad has just built a patio garden at  
 the back where people can sit and have
 a drink.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
