		<title>12CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content>   The children play various  games in 
 the playground. A popular game is Big 
 A, Little A in which some people      
 pretend to be cats and the rest mice. 
 The mice creep up on the cats and say 
 these words 'Big A,little A, bouncing 
 B, the cat's in the cupboard and can't
 catch me.' Then the cats turn around  
 and chase the mice. Whoever is caught 
 joins the cats and the game continues 
 until one mouse is left and the       
 survivor becomes the first cat next   
 time.                                 
      Other games they like to play    
 are: Stuck in the Mud, Grandmother's  
 Footsteps, Black Cat, Red Letter, Buzz
 Off, and British Bulldog. They also   
 play skipping games, hopscotch,       
 netball, football and cricket.
