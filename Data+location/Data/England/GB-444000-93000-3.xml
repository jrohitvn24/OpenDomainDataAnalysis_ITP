		<title>03REW STREET NEAR GURNARD.</title>
		<content> On the west side of the marsh is Rew  
 Street.It is a long road with houses  
 and farms.There is a pond in Rew      
 Street and the farmer has put some    
 ducks on the pond and made a nesting  
 box and put it in the middle of the   
 pond.There are rats by the pond, I    
 think they are eating the duck food.  
 When we find frogs we put them in the 
 pond and this year the pond was black 
 with tadpoles. Rew Street still has   
 three gas street lights.One outside   
 Baskett's farm,the second outside     
 Sunny Cot caravan site and the third  
 on Hillis Corner. There were four(one 
 opposite Hart's farm) but that was    
 replaced by an electric light because 
 the old one had rusted away.
