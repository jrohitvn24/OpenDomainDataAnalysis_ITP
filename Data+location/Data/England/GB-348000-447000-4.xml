		<content> Nether Wyresdale St.Peter's C.of E.   
 School,Scorton,has been educating     
 village children for over a century.  
   Today there are 25 juniors and 17   
 infants on roll.They are taught by 1  
 part_time and 2 full_time teachers    
 helped by a nursery assistant.        
   The school is associated with       
 St.Peter's parish and pupils take part
 in church services such as Harvest    
 Festival.The "Friends of Scorton      
 School"arrange social and fund_raising
 events and provide many pieces of     
 extra equipment for the school.       
   In 1984 when the County Council     
 served a closure notice on the school 
 there were strong protests and an     
 Action Committee presented the case   
 for retaining the school.The closure  
 notice was withdrawn in summer 1985.
