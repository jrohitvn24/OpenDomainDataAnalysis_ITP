		<content>   Castle Eden Dene is very popular,   
 nearly everyone in this area knows it.
 You go to the Dene for some peace and 
 quiet. You also go to see the views.  
 Unfortunately some people just use it 
 to dump their bags of rubbish and old 
 beds and things. Others use it to play
 games like hide and seek. It can also 
 be used for school trips or you can   
 just take your dog for a walk by      
 yourself.There are twenty kilometres  
 of paths for visitors to walk along.  
 One quarter of a million people visit 
 the Dene because it is so beautiful   
 and it is also very interesting.      
   There ara 350 different sorts of    
 flowering plants and about the same   
 number of non_flowering plants. 300   
 fungi also grow in the Dene. About 38 
 types of trees live here, including   
 86,000 Elm trees. Many of these have  
 to be cut down.                       </content>
