   Residential land occupies most of   
 the area containing buildings. There  
 is very little industrial land in the 
 area due to the large amount of arable
 farming.                              
   Towards the east of the area more   
 buildings appear, as Weeley itself is 
 just north of this part of the area.  
 According to the inhabitants, 50% of  
 the houses in the area were built     
 after 1945.                           
   The west part only contains a few   
 farms to manage the large amount of   
 arable farmland.                      
{ROADS}                                
   Many roads have poor services. Some 
 minor roads are often dirt or gravel  
 tracks. Footpaths are often similar or
 non-existent. There are no unnecessary
 roads which waste space.
