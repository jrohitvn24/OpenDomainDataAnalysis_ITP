       {A child's day by Melissa       
 At 9 o'clock we did spelling.  Then we
 did maths and reading.   In assembly  
 I played the recorder.  We had l5     
 minutes playtime and I did handstands.
 Then we wrote a diary.  After school  
 dinner it was playtime again.  We     
 practised italic handwriting and I    
 drew a pattern.  After a story I went 
 home at 3 o'clock.                    </content>
