		<content> On leaving Winson the Coln widens out 
 and flows through the picturesque     
 village of Ablington which has a      
 wealth of old buildings. There is a   
 fine l6.Century Elizabethan Manor     
 House in the grounds of which there is
 a number of beautiful old trees, a l7.
 Century unspoilt farmhouse on whose   
 gateposts stand two stone lions from  
 the Houses of Parliament, splendid    
 tithebarns and a number of ancient    
 farms and cottages, most of which were
 built 200-300 years ago of the local  
 stone.Unusually for a Cotswold village
 Ablington does not have a church; nor 
 does it have any shops or other       
 amenities. In the spring its river    
 banks are covered with daffodils,     
 and many townspeople and tourists come
 to admire its beauty.
