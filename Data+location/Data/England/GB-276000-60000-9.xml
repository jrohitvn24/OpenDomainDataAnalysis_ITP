		<title>09GREEN LANES</title>
		<content> Our squares are covered with a net    
 work of Green lanes most of which are 
 bridle paths, but some have been      
 cleared and put into use after many   
 years. The lanes are unpaved, very    
 narrow and have plants that almost    
 meet in the middle.They are very hot  
 to walk along because there are high  
 banks on each side. We worked out that
 the hedges where about 900 years old  
 so were probably growing at the time  
 of the first Domesday book. Shrubs and
 bushes include beech,sycamore,hawthorn
 ,dogrose ,holly ,hazel,sloe,oak,elder 
 and wild flowers,red campion,herb     
 robert,foxglove,penny wort,black      
 berry,cranes bill,goose grass,harts   
 toungue fern,purple and yellow        
 vetch,yellow dead nettle,speed well,  
 ,marsh marigold,celandine ,primrose,
