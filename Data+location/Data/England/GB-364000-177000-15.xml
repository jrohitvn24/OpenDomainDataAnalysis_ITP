{FARMING}                              
 The area has over a dozen farms in the
 EAST and NORTH_EAST of the block. We  
 have discovered that at least seven of
 these farms are still operating as    
 farms. Two others operate as poultry  
 farms and there are two riding stables
 and one dog kennels. All of there     
 farms are on land that is, or was,    
 used as farm land.                    
 The farms at {HENFIELD},{HALLEN}and{  
{SERRIDGE}farms all have beef cattle as
 there main occupation.
