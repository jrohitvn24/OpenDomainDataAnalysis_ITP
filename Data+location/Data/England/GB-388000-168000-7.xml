		<title>07My Weekend - Linda</title>
		<content> Last weekend I went to the shops with 
 Mum and Dad and we went to Corsham and
 then we went to the town in           
 Chippenham.  We went in Woolworths and
 I bought a book and a tape.  The tape 
 has the story of Sleeping Beauty on it
 and the book has the same story.  You 
 can read along with the tape.  I went 
 out to play with my friends and then  
 had my tea.  On Sunday my Dad and I   
 went to the shop and I had 50p to     
 spend.  Then we went home and I played
 with my friends.  At home I played    
 with my sister and my cat.  Then I was
 called to have my dinner so me and my 
 Mum and my Dad and my sister had our  
 dinner.  Afterwards me and my sister  
 watched Tom and Jerry on the          
 television.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
