		<content>  {R.H.P.}is one of the{biggest ball   
{and roller bearing}factories in       
{Britain.}It's work force was{once over
{5000}but is{now}down to{1250.}The car 
 industry is their main customer and   
 they  export to many countries.       
   In world war 2 the factory was a    
 prime target for German bombs and     
 considerable damage was done and many 
 workers were killed.                  
   At the turn of the century when they
 first began, Hoffmann had almost the  
 whole sales market but after World War
 2,other companies gave greater compet-
 ition.{In 1971 Ransome Hoffmann and   
{Pollard}combined and the future seemed
 more assured although in recent years 
 cheaper bearings from Japan flooded   
 the market and will continue to pose a
 threat to local employment.
