		<title>09JERSEY'S TIDAL RANGE</title>
		<content>   The southeastern corner of Jersey at
 La Rocque, has the greatest low tide  
 expanse of rock, shingle and sand in  
 the island.  The extreme range of tide
 is slightly in excess of 13 metres on 
 exceptional spring tides that occur   
 every few years.  However, a range of 
 almost 12 metres is common for several
 spring tides each years.  At low      
 spring tides it is possible to walk   
 for more than 2 kilometres in a       
 straight line towards Seymour Tower   
 and not reach the low tide mark.  The 
 tide rises very rapidly and often     
 surrounds rocks before covering them. 
 Every year several people are cut off 
 and have to be rescued and every other
 year or so someone is drowned here.  {
