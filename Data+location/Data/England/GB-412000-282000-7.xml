		<content> 1985 saw millions of B.B.C. television
sport's fans watch Solihull Barons Ice 
Hockey Club play an historic cup game  
against Streathem Redskins, beating    
them for the first time in front of a  
packed 3000 crowd at Solihull's Hobs   
Moat Ice Rink.                         
 A few weeks later, the T.V. audience  
watched as the Barons narrowly lost to 
Durham in the semi-finals of the cup.  
 These performances were incredible    
because, only three years before, the  
Barons were just a group of youngsters 
keen on Ice Hockey and watched only by 
their parents. But, following a change 
in management, sponsors were found to  
finance Canadian players and The Barons
have become one of Britain's most      
feared teams.                          
 The Barons, Solihull's best supported 
team, have high hopes for a successful 
promotion campaign next season.        </content>
