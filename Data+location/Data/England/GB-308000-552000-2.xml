		<title>02Silloth  Trade _ Docks</title>
		<content> The docks area is really where Silloth
 began.   Some business-men in Carlisle
 thought that Silloth would be  a  most
 suitable  place  to  build  a port, so
 between{1854}and{1859 }the railway and
 docks  were  built.  There are now two
 docks _ the{Marshall }(or outer) {Dock
 and the{New Dock}_ both medium in size
 and having a fair amount of trade.    
 There are cattle sheds  but this trade
 has now stopped.{Carr's Mill}is on the
 dockside.  This produces  good quality
{flour and animal feeds, }and  is doing
 well. There are 3 big silos containing
{cement,}owned by{Harrison's.} There is
 regular trade  with  ships and lorries
 in general cargo.   The railway is now
 closed.   On the old marshalling yards
 there are now  a few small  factories.
 The rest of the area has been levelled
 and grassed for sports use.
