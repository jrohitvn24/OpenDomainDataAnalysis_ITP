		<content>Up until 50 years ago most people were 
employed in the village where they     
lived.Each village had its craftsmen   
providing goods and services for its   
people and local farms.Until about 10  
years ago the population consisted     
mostly of people who even if they did  
not work on the land came from families
with a rural background.Increasingly   
however longstanding families are being
displaced by middle class newcomers who
choose to live in the village to enjoy 
the advantages of country life and its 
pleasant relaxed atmosphere with       
opportunities for country pursuits.    
Once installed the newcomers often seek
to restrict development in order to    
conserve the visual amenity of the area
which has the effect of further raising
property prices putting them out of the
reach of many village families.
