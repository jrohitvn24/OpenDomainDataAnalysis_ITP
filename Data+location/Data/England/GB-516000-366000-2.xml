		<title>02TRAFFIC ON THE B1190</title>
		<content> We conducted a{traffic census}on      
 Tuesday 4th June 1985.  The road that 
 we conducted the survey on was the    
{B1190}Lincoln to Horncastle bus route.
 The weather was fine but there was a  
 slight drizzle from 2pm until the end 
 of school at 3pm.  At 1pm the shop    
 closed which may have influenced the  
 rate of pedestrians and cyclists      
 coming past the school from 1pm       
 onwards.  Meanwhile as this was going 
 on the farmers were making good use of
 the hot weather to cut and transport  
 silage.  In the 5 and a half hours    
 that we conducted our census, we      
 counted 211 cars, 101 lorries, 2      
 horses, 7 cyclists, 13 tractors, 6    
 motor cycles, 4 buses and 15          
 pedestrians.  The average number of   
 cars which passed the school in an    
 hour was 66.  Quiet periods were at   
 dinnertime and early afternoon.       </content>
