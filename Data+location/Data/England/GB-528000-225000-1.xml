		<content> The area is predominantly agricultural
 land, with some deciduous woodland &amp;  
 includes the large village of Walkern 
 (pop. 1000), &amp; the smaller village of 
 Ardeley (pop. 140) &amp; the hamlets of   
 Bassus Green &amp; Clay End (pop. about   
 40). Principal crops are wheat &amp;      
 barley, as they were 400 years ago,   
 supplemented by oilseed rape &amp; some   
 lifestock. Although there are a number
 of small businesses in Walkern, which 
 provide employment for residents &amp;    
 those outside the area, the majority  
 (over 70%) look elsewhere for employ- 
 ment - to Stevenage a few miles away &amp;
 other nearby towns, &amp; a sizeable      
 minority commute to London. Country   
 people are resistant to change &amp; there
 is a widespread wish to preserve the  
 community as it is at present; but    
 changes are taking place. The Church, 
 school and pub remain focal points.   </content>
