		<title>18PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content>  Sticks is a game played with a ball  
 and 3 pegs.We have two teams that play
 against each other.One team fields and
 the other team has to try and hit the 
 sticks.If they do they try to run and 
 get away from the ball and fielders.If
 the fielders throw the ball and it    
 misses they try to make the sticks.If 
 they make the sticks they shout out   
 1,2,3,sticks.If the fielders turn to  
 hit the sticks and the same thing     
 carries on .We play to a certain      
 number the first team who gets to that
 number are the winners.
