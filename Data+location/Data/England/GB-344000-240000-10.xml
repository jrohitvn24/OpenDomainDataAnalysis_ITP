		<content> This area has good fertile soil, and  
 farming is the dominant industry.     
 Mixed farming is practised, including 
 dairy and beef cattle, sheep, arable  
 crops and fruit. Farmers aim to       
 produce milk and meat economically by 
 using home-grown feed i.e.silage and  
 barley. Wheat is grown for sale off   
 the farm. Friesians are the main dairy
 breed. The EEC has imposed milk quotas
 because of over-production. The main  
 beef breed is the Hereford, with one  
 pedigree herd in the block. The       
 Hereford/Friesian cross is also       
 popular for its ability to fatten off 
 grass. Sheep from Welsh hill farms are
 brought into the area to over-winter  
 on specially grown rape and turnips.  
 Mechanisation of farming operations   
 since l950 has reduced the number of  
 farm workers but greatly increased the
 capital input of farming.             </content>
