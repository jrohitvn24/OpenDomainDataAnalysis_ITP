		<title>13Fast Food</title>
		<content> Fast food outlets are one of          
 Scarborough's rapid growth industries 
 with several new enterprises opening, 
 and less successful ones closing, each
 year.{The South Bay}and lower part of 
 the town has seen the greatest        
 development during recent years and   
 visitors are able to purchase a wide  
 variety of foods including ice cream, 
 candyfloss, burgers, hot dogs, pizzas,
 kebabs, waffles, baked potatoes and,  
 of course,{fish and chips}which still 
 remain the most popular. Fast{pizza   
 restaurants have been a popular       
 development  and recently a large{fish
 and{chip}restaurant has opened in the 
 middle of town. Many{pubs}have jumped 
 on the fast food bandwagon and are    
 offering very reasonably priced bar   
 snacks and meals often with a         
{children's menu}to attract families.
