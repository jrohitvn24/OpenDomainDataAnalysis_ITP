		<content> Pop stars are a great influence on    
 todays generation.Many groups of      
 people copy pop stars hair,clothes and
 make-up designs.Fashion today is based
 on todays pop stars.Skirts today are  
 usually down to knee height.Teenagers 
 are the most fashionable age group.   
 Todays fashion includes tight         
 trousers,bat-winged jumpers and white 
 jackets etc.Bat-winged jumpers are    
 wool knitted items with big dangling  
 sleeves.This is finished off with lots
 of make-up put on around the eyes,    
 cheeks and lips.This is supposed to   
 make the person look beautiful.Some   
 people put nail varnish on their      
 nails.It is also fashionable to have  
 your ears pierced.This is almost like 
 having a pin put through your ear.
