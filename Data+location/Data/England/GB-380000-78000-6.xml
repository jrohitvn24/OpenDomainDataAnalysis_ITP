		<title>06FISHING IN LULWORTH</title>
		<content>    MR JIM MILLER,who retired as a     
 fisherman in September 1984, told us  
 about his work.                       
    His family have been fishing for   
 several generations and he started    
 working for his Father when he was 14.
 He served in the Navy during the War, 
 then in 1945, he bought a boat called 
 the'Four Girls'for Â£2000.He kept her  
 until 1971,when he bought'Silver Foam'
 which his son now uses.               
    He used to start work at 3.30am and
 fish mainly for{LOBSTER and CRAB,     
 returning home about 4.00pm.Lobsters  
 are sent to a dealer in Portland, who 
 then sends them to France or Spain.   
    The best months for fishing are    
 January_June;the worst is August.     
    Mr Miller's son and his 2 nephews  
 still carry on the family tradition,  
 with their two boats;fishing up to 7_ 
 12 miles out from the Cove.           </content>
