		<title>11WANSFORD PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>   Wansford church is very old, part of
 it dating to Saxon Times. The most    
 recent structural change is that the  
 vestry has been extended. Presently it
 costs Â£7,000 to run the church for a  
 year. The church is essential to a    
 village as it is a place for the      
 community to meet together.           
  A vicar is a hard working person who 
 works 60 to 70 hours a week and       
 therefore is known by most of the     
 villagers. The congregation is made up
 of Wansford people as well as those   
 who come from the neighbouring        
 villages,making an average number of  
 60 each Sunday. Smaller numbers       
 regularly attend the 3 other services 
 during the week. Those who work out of
 the village do not contribute as much 
 to the village church as the locals,  
 who provide a church choir, two       
 gardeners and two church wardens.     </content>
