		<title>19LIVING IN RUNCORN</title>
		<content> I have lived in Runcorn for eight     
 years.I like Runcorn.There is a       
 carnival every year.My dad takes me   
 running with him,we go on a long run  
 for about two miles.Every Friday I go 
 to the Shopping City with my mum.We   
 leave my sister with my dad.I go to   
 the library and pick four books.I     
 sometimes go up to Big park and take  
 my fishing net with me.We always take 
 a bag with pop and butties.We do some 
 fishing.Once we caught five fish,     
 three tadpoles and seven frogs.We took
 them home.I go to Youth Club with my  
 friend Jane and we have lots of fun.I 
 have a game of Table Tennis and       
 Badminton and sometimes I get a drink 
 of cold milk and some sweets.Youth    
 Club starts at 7pm and finishes at    
 9.30pm.
