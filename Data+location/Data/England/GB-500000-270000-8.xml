RAUNDS MANOR BRICKWORKS is on the      
eastern edge of RAUNDS. They were      
established in 1898 and were in use    
until they closed down in 1975.  It was
originally owned by MR. G.E.SMITH who  
passed it on to his son MR TOM SMITH,  
who still owns it. The clay to make the
bricks was dug from the claypits which 
are adjacent to the old kilns. Coal,   
which was used to fire the kilns, was  
brought in by rail on a mineral line   
from the station. Now that the works   
are no longer in use, MR SMITH would   
like to see the buildings knocked down 
and the claypits filled in to stop them
being a danger to anyone. He does not  
want the land to be built on and he    
would like to see it become an area for
wildlife, in particular a bird         
sanctuary.
