		<content> After getting dressed,taking me half  
 an hour to  decide what to wear,I had 
 my breakfast,did my hair and went to  
 school.It was pouring with rain as    
 usual.School was quite enjoyable but  
 uneventful.                           
 After school,I went to my friend's    
 home.We had a great time playing      
 games.Going home though,my bike went  
 funny,I skidded and crashed to the    
 ground.I was badly hurt and covered in
 mud.A woman was walking by but didn't 
 offer to help so I had to get myself  
 home.When I got home I couldn't eat   
 anything because of the shock.After   
 watching T.V. I was hungry so I fried 
 up a real "slap up" meal.Dad though   
 went nuts with me for eating so late  
 but I gulped it down not taking any   
 notice because it was so delicious !
