Desiree Potatoes.  Mr Kemp showed us   
corn silos and we were allowed inside  
to have a look.  They are all black and
very hot.  They are used for drying and
storing the corn which can be pumped   
into them and out again.  Hot air can  
be circulated by a fan.  We went into  
the very long thatched barn.  It was   
empty so we had a race from one end to 
the other.  It can hold 400 tons of    
potatoes.                              
  We looked at the reservoir.  It can  
hold four million gallons of water     
which is used to water the crops.      
 We went into the old oast house and   
saw three furnaces on the ground floor.
There were some old stilts once used   
for stringing and harvesting the hops. 
We saw the wheel they used for         
measuring land.  It measures a rod     
which 16.5 ft. (about 5 metres).       </content>
