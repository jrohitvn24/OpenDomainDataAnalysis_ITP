		<content>                                       
       On Akeferry Road there is a     
{bakery.                               
       The owners of the{bakery}used to
 live in Doncaster.                    
       The baker and his wife came to  
 Westwoodside after he retired from    
 being a chef. They saw an old{bakery  
 for sale, and restored it. They still 
 use the old dough mixer, which is a   
 machine for mixing dough, and they    
 also use the old oven.                
       They do not use chemicals and   
 additives in their food. All their    
 food is baked on the premises. They   
 find the hardest thing to make is a   
 hovis loaf. They catered for the Royal
 Yacht staff in 1963. Most people in   
 the south east of the village use the 
 bakery.
