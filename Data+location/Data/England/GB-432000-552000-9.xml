		<content>   I live in Fletcher Crescent, in a   
 terraced council house. It is a good  
 place to live, the street is always   
 clean and tidy. There are 6 garages in
 our street and my dad owns one of     
 them. Behind our house are allotments.
   At the bottom of my street is a farm
 with hens, horses, dogs and cats. At  
 the top of my street is a{riding      
{school}with about 40 horses.          
   Over the road from the riding school
 is Herrington Hill. Here there are    
 woods and a pill-box left over from   
 the war. From Herrington Hill you can 
 walk to Newbottle or the{Club Grounds 
 where there are three bowling greens  
 but only two are used. There are also 
 two football fields. Near the Club    
 Grounds is{Philadelphia Yard}where men
 repair machinery for the colliery.    
 This is at the back of our house and  
 has been open for over 150 years.     </content>
