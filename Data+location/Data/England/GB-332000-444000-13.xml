		<title>13FLOODS IN FLEETWOOD</title>
		<content> In 1926 Fleetwood council and a local 
 estate agency spent Â£55,000 on        
 building a sea wall to guard Fleetwood
 from the sea.  The following year     
 there was a flood, and the damage was 
 estimated at Â£11,000.  By 1928 the    
 wall was complete and officially      
 opened by Lord Derby in 1930.         
 Years later in 1977 Fleetwood was     
 again flooded and although the extent 
 of the damage was worse than that of  
 1927, no_one was hurt. Many houses and
 schools were damaged particularly in  
 the Larkholme area. It was reported in
 some of the local newspapers that     
 people were actually drowning, but    
 this was merely press exaggeration and
 the only sufferers were pets. The old 
 sea wall was totally demolished in    
 some areas and there now stands a much
 taller, supposedly stronger wall.
