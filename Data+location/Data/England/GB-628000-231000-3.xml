		<content>Rabbits and other animals abound, but  
there are very few trees, only scrub   
and briars. On the beach there are bits
of fossils like sharks teeth and       
amber. There is too much rubbish from  
ships, visitors and fishermen. Fish    
that local fishermen catch are  cod,   
mackerel, crabs, lobsters, shrimps,    
whiting, eels, dabs, sole, pouting, and
white pout. The oldest buildings are   
Landguard Fort and the Martello        
Tower. Lots of the local housing is in 
terraces. They are built of Suffolk red
brick. One terrace has Suffolk white   
bricks on the front and a tunnel       
through to the back. The oldest that we
found were built in 1909 and 1910, but 
some date from the end of last century.
Other houses were built more recently. 
The Herman de Stern,formerly a hospital
is now a Community club and St Edmunds 
Hall belongs to the church.            </content>
