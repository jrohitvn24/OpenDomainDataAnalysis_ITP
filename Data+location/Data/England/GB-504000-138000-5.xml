		<content>   Cranleigh School, now one of the    
 most famous public schools was opened 
 in 1865, within two months of the     
 arrival of the railway. It was        
 intended for the sons of farmers and  
 there were 22 boarders and 4 day boys.
 The fees were Â£30 per annum.          
   There are now around 800 boys and a 
 few girls in the Sixth form. They are 
 still mainly boarders but some local  
 boys attend as day boys.              
   In 1912 ground adjacent was pur_    
 chased and a Preparatory School built,
 it takes boys from the age of 8 years.
   Through many generous donations from
 old boys the buildings were expanded  
 to provide science laboratories, a    
 library, gymnasium, speech hall and   
 modern dormitories and studies.       
   Standing on a rise at the edge of   
 the village it has a golf course as   
 part of its extensive sports grounds. </content>
