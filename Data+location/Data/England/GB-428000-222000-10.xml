		<title>10WHAT GOES ON IN CHURCHILL</title>
		<content>  Churchill, with the hamlet of        
 Sarsden, is a small combined village, 
 with a few regular events, many of    
 which take place in the village hall. 
 There is usually some village activity
 each month which draws people         
 together, and fund-raising events for 
 charities are well-supported.         
  There is a weekly keep-fit class, and
 fortnightly whist drives , as well as 
 an annual gymkhana.   There is also a 
 twice-yearly village market in aid of 
 upkeep of the village hall.  This     
 summer an afternoon cream tea with    
 stalls was held to raise money for    
 street lighting, and a fete at Sarsden
 Glebe to raise funds for the church.  
  There are choral and instrumental    
 concerts which take place in the      
 church, and carols are sung around the
 lighted Christmas tree on the village 
 green.                                </content>
