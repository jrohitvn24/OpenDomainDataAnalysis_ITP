		<content>  The area of Dartington is fortunate  
 to have a number of buildings of      
 historical and architectural interest.
 They range from the Norman buildings  
 of Dartington Hall, Totnes Castle,and 
 the Cott Inn to International Style   
 and Neo-Classical buildings forming   
 part of the Dartington Estate,        
 constructed under the patronage of    
 Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst.These    
 include the Central Offices of the    
 Dartington Hall Trust,the Headmaster's
 house of Dartington School,a number of
 Estate workers houses and a small     
 development of rented houses at Broom 
 Park. Architects involved included    
 William Lescaze and Lois De Soissons. 
  The area also has a number of radical
 new developments,including Hunters    
 Moon and Riverside housing estates,and
 Webbers Yard industrial estate.
