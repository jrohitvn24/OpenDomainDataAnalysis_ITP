 Mr Bowe has been fishing for 53 years.
 He doesnt come from a fishing family, 
 his father was an actor. He said that 
 his boat used a gallon of diesel every
 4 miles.                              
 As we headed back to the harbour the  
 sea washed over the boat as the wind  
 changed and the jelly fish we saw just
 below the water convined us that we   
 were better off on the water than in  
 it.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
