{Good Companions:} They meet each      
 fortnight (Thursday afernoons) in the 
 Village Hall. This is for retired     
 people and they are joined by people  
 outside the block. The main purpose is
 of a social nature and visits are     
 arranged during the year. Each meeting
 concludes with some form of game-quite
 frequently bingo is played.           
                                       
{Youth Club:}This meets weekly in the  
 Village Hall and was inaugurated a    
 year ago. The youngsters-up to 11-meet
 from 7 to 8.30 and the Seniors follow.
 Much of the activity is based on games
 and sport, but it seems the older     
 youths are not prepared to do much,   
 most of their needs have to be        
 provided and it would seem this will  
 not last very long.
