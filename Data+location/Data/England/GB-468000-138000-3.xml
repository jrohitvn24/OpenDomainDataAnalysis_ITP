		<content>    I go to the Public Gardens as often
 as I can. There are a roundabout,     
 seesaws and swings and a mound with   
 trees and bushes on it. There are some
 flower beds, a bandstand and some     
 stone seats with sheltering trees,    
 where old people come for some peace. 
 There are some statues in the Gardens 
 and a bowling green.                  
    Flood Meadows is a large area of   
 grassland with some trees and the     
 River Wey running through.In the      
 morning many people come to walk their
 dogs there. There is a play area with 
 a slide and climbing frame. In the    
 spring you can find frogspawn. You can
 also see toads, lizards and ducks.    
    Kings Pond, to the east of town,   
 has swans and ducks which I feed when 
 I go for a ride there. I have a tree  
 camp and we play football on the      
 grass.                                </content>
