		<title>16       HOUSING</title>
		<content> Although {Askern }is a mining         
 community, the pit estate is not in   
 our area. The {housing}in our area is 
 split between the older council {     
{houses}and the new private estate at  
 the top of Moss Road. Most of the     
{housing}is in one small part of our   
 area. The remainder of the area is    
 farmland with only a handful of farm  
 houses scattered around. We asked 81  
 people and found that                 
      37 lived in semidetached houses  
      24 lived in terraced houses      
      11 lived in detached houses      
       8 lived in bungalows            
       1 lived in a cottage            
       1 lived in a flat               
 Most people live in rented            
 accommodation either from the council 
 or the pit, but all houses in the area
 are modernised - they all have        
 bathrooms for instance.               </content>
