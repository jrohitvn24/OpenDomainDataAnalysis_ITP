		<content> There are many different church groups
 represented in the area.              
 The only church in the village is the 
 local Church of England where services
 are held every sunday.                
                                       
 Other denominations go either to      
 other villages or towns or have house 
 meetings.                             
                                       
 There is also a church on the Air Base
 which is inter-denominational. Some   
 groups have combined services here    
 with the local people.
