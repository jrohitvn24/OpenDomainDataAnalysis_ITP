		<content> Mobility plays a large part in        
 people's lives. Communications in the 
 form of TV, radio and telephone make a
 great deal of difference to contact   
 with the outside world. The pace of   
 life is generally fast with health    
 affected by this in both positive and 
 negative ways.Home Life for the       
 majority centres around the television
 set, then within essential village    
 halls and pubs; with churches in third
 place. Most people have hair and other
 beauty treatments done professionally.
 Since the advent of London Overspill, 
 vandalism and theft have led to       
 greater insecurity; people being less 
 willing to leave cash out for         
 tradesmen. The unemployed young tend  
 to congregate in apathetic groups for 
 security; tinker with cars and motor  
 cycles; go rabbiting and smoke and    
 drink.                                </content>
