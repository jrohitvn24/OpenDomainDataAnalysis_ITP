		<content> The area of our block covers three    
 villages, Petham, Lower Hardres and   
 Upper Hardres. They stand on{chalk    
 country about 5 miles to the south of 
{CANTERBURY.}The land is used almost   
 exclusively for{farming}of various    
 kinds. Formerly{hop farming}was very  
 important in the Petham area but we   
 have found no hop gardens or working  
 oasts at all in this area now. There  
 are still{fruit crops}grown at Petham 
 and Lower Hardres, mainly apples and  
 pears but these seem of less import-  
 ance than cereals and grassland.      
 There are many areas of woodland,     
 mainly{coppiced deciduous wood.       
 Although we worked with recent Ordin- 
 ance Survey Maps, it was noticeable   
 that many field boundaries no longer  
 existed.It see probably that{hedges}in
 particular have been removed to facil-
 itate the use of{farm machinery.      </content>
