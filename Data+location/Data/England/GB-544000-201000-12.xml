		<title>12EPPING'S COMMUNITY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> People in Epping have proved their    
{support}for their community hospital  
 by raising a large amount of money    
 over the years. The most recent       
 efforts have been an appeal for a     
{mammography scanner}which was launched
 in April 1984 for Â£70,000: by June    
 1985 Â£79,500 had been raised. Local   
 people again joined with staff of     
 Walthamstow Bus Garage in raising     
 Â£4,500 in the last two years for two  
{heart machines.                       
 It will cause great sadness if the    
 hospital comes to a close completely. 
 This, we hope, will never happen, but 
 in 1985 expensive equipment and an    
 ageing community mean a new hospital  
 system_{"Core and cluster".}Sadly the 
 core is in Harlow, not Epping.
