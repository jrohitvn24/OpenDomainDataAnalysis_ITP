		<title>18Fishing the River Weaver.1.</title>
		<content> The{River Weaver}flows through the    
 centre of our area and there are four 
 of us from Class 4 of Underwood West  
 Juniors who have fished in this       
 river.                                
 You need a line with a breaking       
 strain of about four pounds. The size 
 of your hook can vary,but a size 18 is
 about right.                          
 There are a lot of good fish in the   
 river,like carp, pike,gudgeon and     
 bream. Usually we use maggots as      
 bait,but sometimes we use the fly     
 fishing method. We use self-cocking   
 floats and it is a good idea to use a 
 nine foot rod (about 3 metres) as the 
 river is very narrow in places.       
 Sometimes it pays to use sweetcorn as 
 a bait,especially   first thing in the
 morning or when it has been raining.  
 Dough can be used as well,but we think
 maggots are the best.                 </content>
