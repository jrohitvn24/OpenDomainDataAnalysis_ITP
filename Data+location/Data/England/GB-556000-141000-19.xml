		<title>19GAMES CHILREN PLAY</title>
		<content>    Nowadays older children don't play 
as many games as they would have done  
in the past.Some favourite games of    
younger children are skipping,         
kiss-chase and hopscotch.              
    Older children in their spare time 
go to youth clubs,discos and other     
organisations,but if they don't go out 
they mostly spend their time watching  
T.V.,listening to records or tapes of  
popular music or listening to the      
radio.Girls in their spare time        
sometimes read magazines,go to the     
town or meet friends.Boys like playing 
cricket, football, fishing, bike riding
and break-dancing.Break-dancing        
originally came from America and is a  
form of energetic disco dance/gymnast- 
ics.Many children have their own small 
computer and spend much time playing   
computer games.
