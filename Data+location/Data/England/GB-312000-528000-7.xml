		<title>07Oldest Shop in Cockermouth</title>
		<content> I visited J.B.Banks, General          
 Iron-monger and Locksmith since 1836. 
 I walked into the shop to see all the 
 original shop fittings. There are 173 
 small wooden drawers full of twisted  
 nails, staples, vine eyes, rivets and 
 washers. Keys are made at one end of  
 the counter. Displayed are some keys  
 over 100 years old. Goods are weighed 
 and sold by the lb. The brass weights 
 range from 1/2 ounce to 28 lbs and    
 stand gleaming beside brass scales.   
 The shop extends to the yard beyond   
 and a well has been discovered.       
 Upstairs is a tinsmith's workshop     
 with workbenches, vices and rows of   
 "cokers", which were nailed to clogs. 
 Banks' Yard has a Doll's Gallery where
 dolls old and new can be seen.        
 I can buy tools, seeds, camping       
 equipment and look at collections of  
 coins, lanterns and farm implements.  </content>
