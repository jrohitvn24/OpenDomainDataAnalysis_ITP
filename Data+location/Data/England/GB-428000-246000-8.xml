		<content> There are no schools of any kind in   
 our D Block.The children below 11     
 years of age who live in the area     
 either attend the state schools in    
 Ettington or Butlers Marston.These    
 schools have the following catchment  
 areas;Ettington_Pillerton Priors,     
 Butlers Marston_Pillerton Hersey,     
 Butlers Marston and Combroke.Fulready 
 belongs to Tysoe.The number on roll in
 these schools,Butlers Marston 32      
 Ettington 130 and Tysoe 152 has been  
 greatly reduced recently.Some children
 attend private (fee paying)school in  
 Warwick and Stratford upon Avon.      
     The three schools who provide     
 education for our area are all Church 
 of England schools.This means that    
 although they are supported by the    
 state the children attending them     
 are given a Christian education linked
 with the church.                      </content>
