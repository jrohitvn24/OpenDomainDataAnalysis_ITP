		<content>  Tadcaster and its surroundings have  
 much of interest to offer the tourist 
 and so there is a lot of potential for
{tourism.}Tadcaster is well known for  
 its breweries and its{public houses,} 
 which it has a lot of. It also has a  
 museum and plenty of{old buildings    
 including the remains of a Roman      
 Castle. There is much to please the   
 sightseer with the beautiful River    
 Wharfe with its weir and viaduct.     
 Accommodation is well provided for    
 with historic York only a few miles   
 away. If the car breaks down, there   
 are plenty of garages to get it back  
 on the road. To help the tourist have 
 a good time, there are dances some    
 nights and you are never far from a   
 pub in Tadcaster. Surrounding the town
 is some marvellous{countryside}which  
 can be explored on foot along the     
 numerous footpaths.                   </content>
