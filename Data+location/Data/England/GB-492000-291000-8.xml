		<content>Communications were found to be minimal
...with both Deene and Deenethorpe     
possessing a small post-box mounted on 
a pole (two collections on weekdays &amp;  
one on Saturdays).                     
Deenethorpe also had a phone box, but  
at Deene only the concrete foundations 
remained. Residents explained that     
their kiosk was removed in recent years
...and despite a campaign for its      
retention, British Telecom demolished  
the box in the early hours of a morning
...with several inhabitants reporting  
that they were awaken by "the noise of 
the box being knocked down and taken   
away."                                 
There had been a sub-Post Office in    
Deene,but following the demolition of  
the original building, it moved into a 
terraced house, before lack of trade   
led to closure in 1974.
