		<content> OUR SECOND DOMESDAY BLOCK.            
 We went down Newball Lane and we saw  
 two ducks which were Mallards.You can 
 tell which is a male or a female duck 
 because a male has darker feathers    
 than a female.We saw them together.We 
 also saw a pheasant on the road and   
 Helen saw a hedgehog on the side of   
 the road.We also saw a Yellow Hammer  
 on the fence which when it saw us flew
 away and that is when we noticed      
 it.You can tell it is a Yellow Hammer 
 because it has a yellow tummy.We saw a
 field with lots of blackbirds in it.In
 one forest there were all sorts of    
 trees and when I looked I saw some    
 Christmas trees.We also saw some Oak  
 trees.We saw a pheasant climbing into 
 a sugar-beet field.We went past the   
 place where Mr.Diprose keeps his bees 
 and pheasants.
