		<title>05Cann House</title>
		<content> The original Cann House was built in  
 1863;  since then there has been a    
 fire and various alterations.  In     
 1960, Group Captain Cheshire V.C.     
 bought the house on behalf of the     
 Cheshire foundation.  Since then it   
 has been a Cheshire home for disabled 
 residents.  Prior to this it was owned
 by a family named Tucker who were     
 business financers and property       
 developers.  When their three children
 grew up and married they put Cann     
 House up for sale.  In the grounds    
 there are many different sorts of     
 trees, said to come from all over the 
 world.  They are all different colours
 and the lawns and plants are very     
 beautiful to look at.
