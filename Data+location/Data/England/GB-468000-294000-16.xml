   No equipment is needed for this game
 for any number of players. One or two 
 children are 'on' and they call out   
 another person's name or 'Warlass'. If
 Warlass is called, everybody has to   
 run. The players have to dodge those  
 who are 'on'. Once caught, the player 
 is also 'on' with them.               
                                       
{PIGGY-BACK FIGHTS                     
   No equipment is needed for this game
 for any number of players. You have to
 carry a partner on your back and must 
 try to knock the other pairs over     
 whilst staying upright yourself.
