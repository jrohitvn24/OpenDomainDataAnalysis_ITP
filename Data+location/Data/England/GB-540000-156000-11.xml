		<title>11TRANSPORT IN BIGGIN HILL.</title>
		<content>                                       
The transport in Biggin Hill is not    
very good at all.  If you don't have   
a car you have to take the bus. There  
are only two buses that run through    
Biggin Hill.  One is private and the   
other is public.  Each one comes every 
hour. The buses are not very reliable  
because of the traffic.  The traffic in
the valley is not that bad but getting 
into the valley is quite hard.  In the 
morning the roads are busy because most
people work outside Biggin Hill but it 
is quieter towards mid-day.  The       
nearest railway station is in Bromley  
which you can get to by the public bus 
service.
