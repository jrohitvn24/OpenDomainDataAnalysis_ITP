		<content> Miss Gertie Sims now 91 years old     
 lives in{Eastworth Farm}on the Road to
 Alderholt which is said to be haunted.
 It used to be the{Heathpoult Inn      
 once used by{Smugglers.}Miss Sims has 
 never seen the{Ghost,}but she hears it
 open the door and go up the stairs.   
 She thinks that it is the Ghost of a  
 man who was hung from a nearby tree.  
 The Smugglers used to hide barrels    
 under the floor. A Smuggler tried to  
 give away the secret, so he was caught
 and hung.                             
 Legend has it that{Stephen's Stone,}a 
 solitary block of stone in{Wild Church
{Bottom}has a{golden casket}beneath it.
 It is said that it measures 6M X 3M X 
 3M approx. It could be a{boundary     
{stone.}In 1220 it was recorded as{"Le 
{Horestone"}and was a boundary point in
 this area.                            
                                       </content>
