		<title>06Tillingbourne Trout Farm p2</title>
		<content> Large numbers of trout need plenty of 
 fast-flowing water. The water source  
 is a lake above the farm. The good    
 water supply makes this a suitable    
 site for the farm. The fish tanks     
 are circular, with a self-cleaning    
 action as the water flow circulates   
 round, sweeping debris out through a  
 shielded central hole into an overflow
 pipe maintaining the level inside. The
 fish swim against the flow. The farm  
 buy in fry and rear them to table     
 size. They breed a small number of    
 fish compared to  their final output. 
 A pound of fish costs Â£1.50.          
                                       
 A team of conservationists have       
 recently set up an old  cast-iron     
 water wheel. This uses water from the 
 lake and is hoped in future to drive a
 grinding machine to recycle fish offal
 for the animal feed mill next door.   </content>
