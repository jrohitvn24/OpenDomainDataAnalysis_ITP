		<content> We have about 108 acres and one       
big wooden shed.  It is big enough to  
hold all our cows and calves because   
it has 90 cubicles.  The shed's full   
length is 60 by 45 feet.  As well as   
the 70 beef cattle, we have 150        
Swaledale ewes and 60 mule hogs.  The  
cows are mostly Friesian crossed with  
Angus and we also have Herefords and   
Simmenthal with a Charolais bull.  The 
land is both hilly and flat and has    
not needed to be drained.  About half  
of the land on the farm is used for    
silage and hay to feed the cattle in   
winter. All the hilly land is used for 
either sheep or young stock grazing.   
All the rest of the land is used for   
fodder and beef cattle.  The land that 
has the qualities for crop growing is  
used for fodder and beef cattle        
grazing.
