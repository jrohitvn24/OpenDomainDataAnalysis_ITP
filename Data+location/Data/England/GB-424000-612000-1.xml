		<content> The area consists of a coastal strip  
 with low-lying agricultural land      
 behind to the west.  The beach is     
 shady but with some rocky outcrops and
 a natural harbour is formed at Boulmer
 Haven which is used by the dozen or so
 inshore fishing boats known as Cobles 
 which are worked by men from the      
 village of Boulmer.  The village has  
 about 100 inhabitants and is of linear
 shape running from north to south.    
 With the exception of some private and
 local authority housing at the south  
 end, the village and its buildings are
 owned by the Duke of Northumberland.  
 The villagers are extremely friendly  
 and life in the village is centred on 
 the Boulmer Volunteer Rescue Service, 
 the  Fishing Boat Inn, a small church 
 and the village hall. Inland, the     
 main featrue is RAF Boulmer which     
 services an air/sea rescue service,   </content>
