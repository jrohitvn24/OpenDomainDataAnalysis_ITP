		<title>15HOUSING-OUTSIDE A BUNGALOW</title>
		<content> Most people live in detached bungalows
 .Many of the bungalows have chimneys  
 on their sloping roofs.This suggests  
 that coal fires are still important.  
 Against one side wall there is        
 normally an attached garage.          
 A concrete or chipping drive leads to 
 the garage.                           
 On the front wall there are 2 or 3    
 windows and a central door. Often     
 there is a front porch.               
 The backwall of the bungolow has a    
 simiiar design to the front but the   
 door is generally different.Back doors
 tend to be glass and front doors      
 mostly wood.                          
 The garden surrounds the bungalows.The
 boundary is marked with a hedge or    
 wall.Many have green houses and most  
 gardens have trees and plants ,some   
 gardens have ponds and garden gnomes.
