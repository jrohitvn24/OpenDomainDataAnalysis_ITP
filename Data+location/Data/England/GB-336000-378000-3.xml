		<content>     Two things that the{villagers }   
 could not do with out are the shops   
 and the bank. The shops have probably 
 been there since 1926, before that    
 they were probably only cottages. The 
 bank has always been a bank.          
     There is a{Village Association}   
 which meets in the old St.Anselems    
 sports hall. It discusses things like 
 the running of the buses, the         
 redevelopment of the village and the  
 dangers of storing chemicals in tanks 
 near such a highly populated area.    
     At the end of each meeting there  
 is always a chance for the villagers  
 to ask questions and air their views.
