A typical shift would start with a     
parade, exchange of watches(shifts)    
and designation of duties.These would  
include checking appliances for oil,   
water,lights etc. and that all the     
equipment is there; drills, which may  
involve training with pumps, ladders,  
breathing apparatus, chemical          
incidents, rescue, simulated road      
traffic accidents, radiac equipment,   
etc. Physical training and a lecture   
period would be included  before a     
break for a meal.There would follow    
hydrant inspections,risk inspections   
which give a topographical knowledge   
of risks in a patch. A plan is drawn   
of each risk and aspects noted such    
as access,water supplies, etc. General 
maintenance of equipment such as       
cleaning and repair of hoses would     
need regular attention.                </content>
