		<content>The Village Hall in Charney Bassett    
(which was formerly a Methodist chapel)
is used by various organisations.  The 
Youth Club for the 10-20 age group, has
approximately 40 members, and meets one
evening per week. Activities include   
billiards, table tennis, darts,        
draughts and chess.  There is an       
occasional outing or disco. The Women's
Institute (about 12 members) meet once 
a month.  There are also Keep Fit      
classes (6 members) once a week.  Other
activities which take place at the     
Public House ("The Chequers") include  
darts and crib matches and meetings of 
the Tennis Club and the Amateur        
Dramatic Society.
