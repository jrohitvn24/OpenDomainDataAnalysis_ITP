		<title>12DONCASTER'S GYPSIES</title>
		<content> Our town has long been favoured by    
 travelling folk because of its        
 function as a route centre and its    
 racecourse. True gypsies call         
 themselves "Roma" and Charles Bosville
 so called king of gypsies is said to  
 be buried in a church yard in         
 Rossington.                           
   The family we spoke to are living   
 near Potteric Carr Junction. They have
 travelled up and down the town for 16 
 years. Employment for the men is      
 as horse dealers and scrap merchants. 
 The women make a living door to door  
 trading. When a  fair comes to town   
 they tell fortunes and help on  rides.
   The caravans are full of glass and  
 white furniture. one custom is that   
 nothing inside the caravan is taken   
 outside. The children clean the       
 caravan every day but their life style
 means that they do not attend school. </content>
