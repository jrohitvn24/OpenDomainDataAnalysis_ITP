		<title>17EDUCATION : SPECIAL PROV.</title>
		<content> There are 2 establishments within the 
 block which cater for children with   
 special needs as defind by the 1981   
 Education Act. Both were established  
 prior to the Act and continue to      
 fulfill their original purpose. Both  
 are attached to normal schools. At    
 Cledford County Infants School there  
 is an Assessment Unit, and at         
 Middlewich County Infant School a     
 Partial Hearing Unit. Both are small  
 groups staffed by one teacher and one 
 classroom assistant, and the children 
 are brought by taxi at the Authority's
 expense from all areas of South       
 Cheshire. The partial hearing unit is 
 equipped with radio aids which are    
 small radio receivers tuned to a      
 transmitter worn by the teacher.      
 Children transfer to a similar unit at
 Middlewich County Junior School.
