		<title>08THE NEW VICAR</title>
		<content> We moved into the village at the      
 beginning of{January}and two days     
 after we had lots of snow. The        
 children enjoyed playing in the snow  
 but it was a bit lonely because as it 
 was so cold nobody came out of their  
 houses. As time went on,we began to   
 realise what a friendly place Marsh   
 Gibbon was and people were willing to 
 help us when we had frozen pipes and  
 other problems caused by the bad      
 weather.                              
 On one of my first Sundays I had to go
 to a church in another village,and on 
 the way home I skidded off the road. I
 went to the nearest farmhouse and the 
 farmer got his tractor out and pulled 
 me out of the ditch on to the road    
 again. I tried to be a bit more       
 careful when driving in the snow after
 that.
