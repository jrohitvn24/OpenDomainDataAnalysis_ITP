		<content>     Friesians are the most popular    
 breed but there is a North American   
 and a Holstein influence introduced   
 by the use of artificial insemination 
 which produces larger animals.The     
 basic diet of the large herds (20 to  
 100 head) is grass and silage, whereas
 the smaller units are fed on hay. This
 diet is supplemented by purchased     
 concentrates. Because of E.E.C. quotas
 each farmer's milk production was cut 
 by 10% in 1984. Farmers have reacted  
 to these cuts by reducing cow numbers 
 or by reducing costs. One way to do   
 this is to purchase 'straights' i.e.  
 concentrates before the miller has    
 mixed them and added his costs. The   
 price paid for milk in 1985 is 15p per
 litre but this does vary with quality.
 Because this area is so wet farmers   
 have to house cattle and provide      
 indoor feed longer than elsewhere.    </content>
