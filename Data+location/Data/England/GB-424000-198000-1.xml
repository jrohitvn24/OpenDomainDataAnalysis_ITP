		<title>01Kelmscott Village &amp; Surround</title>
		<content> The villages of Kelmscott and Grafton 
 are situated in the south-west of     
 Oxfordshire, bordering onto           
 Gloucestershire.  The area is farmland
 both dairy and arable, with the river 
 Thames flowing through the middle.    
 The farming community is a close-nit  
 one and long established.  Most of the
 housing in the area is associated with
 the farms, although some commuters    
 from Swindon are now joining in       
 village life.  Four new houses have   
 recently been built in Kelmscott.     
 William Morris had his summer home at 
 Kelmscott Manor for many years, and   
 this attracts tourists to the village 
 all through the year.  The River      
 Thames also carries a large number of 
 holiday boats in the summer and       
 attracts coarse fishermen.  The only  
 church is St. George's at Kelmscott,  
 and the only pub is the Plough.       </content>
