		<title>04DOCTOR'S SURGERY</title>
		<content>  At the doctor's surgery in Peacehaven
 we went into the waiting-room and     
 asked the receptionist to see the     
 nurse.                                
  The nurse came immediately and showed
 us round.There are twelve rooms       
 altogether including the toilets.In   
 the surgery there are 6 receptionists,
 4 doctors and 3 nurses,2 full time and
 1 part-time.The surgery was built in  
 1980.                                 
 The facilities are adequate for their 
 8000 existing patients but many more  
 people would like to be their patients
 but they just have to say no.
