 end of Church Street.Built on the site
 of the Argustinian monastry.Legend    
 says that{Henry VIII}used to visit    
{Elizabeth Blount}at Jericho Priory.   
 From 1676 to 1851 a{window tax}was    
 introduced to England.Windows in the  
 Priory were blocked up in order to    
 avoid the tax.During the 1950s when   
 the house belonged to the Marriage    
 family{Polo matches}were held every   
 Sunday afternoon in a field down the  
 Ingatestone Road.The{grounds}of the   
 Priory are very beautiful and used to 
 be opened to the village and public   
 for money raising{events}.Fingereth   
 Hall stands on the site of the        
{Fingereth Manor}which is mentioned in 
 the original{Domesday Book.}It is now 
 a modern dairy{farm.}In 1933 a        
 fourteen bedroomed house was pulled  }
 down and replaced.{                   </content>
