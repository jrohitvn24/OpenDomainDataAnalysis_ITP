		<content> This block is very sparsely populated 
 save for a small area to the north    
 west which includes the outskirts of  
 Minehead;Woodcombe,a pleasant         
 residential area,and part of a housing
 estate partly built by the{Greater    
{London Council}a few years ago to     
 house some of their elderly overspill 
 population.Two thirds of the remaining
 area is rich farmland growing cereals 
 and keeping beef cattle and sheep.Some
 of the farmers graze their sheep on   
 open moorland during the summer.There 
 are several large farms,some owned by 
 the National Trust and some by the    
 Lytton family centred locally at      
 Bratton Court,a{medieval manor house.}
 The remainder of the land is deciduous
 and mixed woodland managed by the     
 National Trust and the Forestry       
 Commission.Much of the woodland is    
 accessible to the public.             </content>
