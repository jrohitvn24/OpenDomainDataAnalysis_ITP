		<content> SHIRLEY STATION                       
  Used by commuters for travelling to  
 and from Birmingham.The station is    
 particularly busy at 8.30am. and      
 5.00pm.                               
 AQUEDUCT                              
  This carries the Canal and the River 
 Cole and a road winds underneath.     
 CANAL                                 
  This is mostly used for pleasure     
 trips by narrowboats.It is much busier
 in the summer months.                 
 DRAWBRIDGE                            
  This is a particularly interesting   
 feature of the area.It is lifted by   
 the use of a windlass.Situated close  
 by is "The Drawbridge Pub"-a fairly   
 new hostelry which serves beers and   
 meals of a "bargee" flavour.
