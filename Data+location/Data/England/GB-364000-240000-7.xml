		<title>07ASHPERTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> This church, close to the site of the 
 castle, has remnants of a thirteenth  
 century chapel in the chancel arch.   
 The building is in good condition but 
 the ring of four bells is not used and
 is described as 'derelict'. It is part
 of Bosbury United Benefice with four  
 other parishes under one vicar, living
 in Bosbury. There are 64 people on the
 electoral roll and the usual          
 congregation numbers 10-15, mainly    
 elderly people. The Parochial Church  
 Council is a group of parishioners who
 are responsible for the maintenance   
 and heating of the building and they  
 must also make a substantial          
 contribution to the Diocese on behalf 
 of the parish, which helps pay the    
 vicar's Stipend. The regulars must be 
 thinking constantly about fund        
 raising. The vicar aims to attract    
 more young people and young families. </content>
