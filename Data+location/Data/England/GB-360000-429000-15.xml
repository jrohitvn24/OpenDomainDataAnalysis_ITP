		<title>15SAMLESBURY HALL TODAY</title>
		<content>The Hall is now used as a centre for   
buying and selling antiques, with a    
percentage of the proceeds going       
towards the upkeep of the building and 
grounds. There is also a clothes and   
crafts department operating on the same
principle.A nature trail has been drawn
up, which covers the extensive gardens 
and a small nature reserve on the other
side of the adjacent A677.             
One area is used by the Bowmen of      
Pendle and Samlesbury, who run a very  
successful club with a large following.
The Hall and original outbuildings are 
believed to have had a quadrangular    
lay out, but there is no present       
evidence of this. A more recent        
stableblock was  converted for staff   
accomodation and the caretaker lives   
in a comparatively modern gatehouse.
