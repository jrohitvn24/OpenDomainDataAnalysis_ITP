		<content>      Morecambe is situated on the     
 North West coast at the southern edge 
 of the Lake District. It is sheltered 
 to the east and north by mountains    
 which gives it a distinctly local     
 climate. Its winters are relatively   
 mild and very wet.                    
      Historically it has grown from   
 the villages of Bare, Torrisholme and 
 Poulton and recently become part of   
 Lancaster City Council. Lancaster     
 bounds the area to the east. Lancaster
 was a thriving industrial town but    
 this has declined and tourism now     
 plays a large part in the life of the 
 area as a whole.                      
      Morecambe is famous for its      
 shrimps caught and potted locally.    
 People born and bred in the town are  
 known as 'Sand Grown Uns' as was Eric 
 Morecambe. It is renowned for its     
 beautiful sunsets and panoramic views.</content>
