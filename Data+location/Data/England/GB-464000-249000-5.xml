		<content> The Fermer Farm Sawmill was started   
 five years ago and is part of the     
 estate of Lord Hesketh.Managed by Mr. 
 Roy Goodger the site occupies about   
 five acres and employs a staff of nine
 who are all local people.The majority 
 of business is supplying fencing      
 materials to local farmers and also   
 over an area of fifty miles from base.
 Fencing materials are pressure treated
 by Tandilin which will give the wood a
 life of thirty to forty years.Two     
 vehicles aid the work and modern      
 machinery is used for all sawing      
 purposes,a new sawing machine will be 
 installed later this year.Summertime  
 work is conducted outside but there is
 covered shelter for winter work.Oak is
 supplied to the furniture trade.
