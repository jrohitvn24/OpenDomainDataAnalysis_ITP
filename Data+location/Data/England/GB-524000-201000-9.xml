		<title>09Family Life At The Weekend</title>
		<content>    On Sunday I went to Hendon to see  
 an open day with the Metropolitan     
 Police. First my family and I saw the 
 police dogs in action.They followed   
 some orders,then they went over an    
 obstacle course. After that a few men 
 were robbers so the dogs could show us
 how they caught the robbers. Atone    
 part two policeman brought out a      
 stretcher for a man but the dog       
 climbed on it and was carried away.   
 When that had finished we went to have
 somthing to eat then we went to the   
 training school to have a look round. 
 There I sat on a moter bike before we 
 went home.
