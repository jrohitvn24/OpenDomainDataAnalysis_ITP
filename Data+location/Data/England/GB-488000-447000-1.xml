		<title>01WOLD ARABLE FARMLAND</title>
		<content> Because of the geology of the area the
 type of agriculture can be limited. In
 many parts of the Humberside Wolds the
 depth of soil may only be a few centi-
 metres. This can reduce the number of 
 crops that can be successfully grown, 
 crops such as potatoes and sugar beet 
 are not very common on the wolds. But 
 because of the free-draining          
 characteristics of the land, it is    
 possible to grow cereal crops, in many
 cases very efficiently. As well as    
 mainly cereal crops, various break    
 crops are used in the crop rotation   
 including oil seed rape (used to      
 produce vegetable oil) peas (far      
 freezing and drying) etc. Most farms  
 in the area keep some animals, sheep  
 and beef cattle on the permanant      
 pasture and grass legs which can be   
 part of the arable rotation, intensive
 pigs are also a feature of the wolds. </content>
