		<content>{Some pupils' views.}                  
    Logo as a language is both useful  
 and interesting. Learning to write    
 LOGO programs on the computer can help
 you understand how to solve problems. 
 Amazing graphics can be produced with 
 very simple procedures. The beauty of 
 LOGO is that even the youngest child  
 can learn to use it.                  
    Anyone can make very artistic      
 patterns with LOGO. Once the use of   
 procedures has been tackled, it is    
 easy to produce patterns and pictures.
 It is no use thinking that you can    
 draw a hand in 5 minutes. A lot of    
 time has to be taken working out      
 angles and distances. Quite simply,   
 LOGO is drawing with maths.
