		<content>            WIGMORE HALL               
 Wigmore Hall was originally erected   
 about 1480, probably at the           
 instigation of Edward IV.  As Edward, 
 Duke of York, he had inherited the    
 Honour and Lordship of Wygmore,       
 Wygmore Boro, and Wygmore Forine      
 (Foreign) on the death of his father, 
 Richard, Duke of York, at the battle  
 of Wakefield during the Wars of the   
 Roses.   Richard had previously       
 inherited the estates from his mother,
 Anne Mortimer, who married Richard    
 Plantagenet, Earl of Cambridge.       
 A replica of a Plantagenet mural was  
 discovered behind some Tudor panelling
 in 1913, commemorating the Battle of  
 Mortimer's Cross in 1461, the outcome 
 of which put the House of York on the 
 Throne.
