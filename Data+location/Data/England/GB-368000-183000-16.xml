		<title>16LEISURE IN NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> We surveyed the people of North Yate. 
 We asked them all if they played a    
 sport regularly and just under half of
 them did, and about half of them go to
 watch sport regularly. We asked them  
 how many went to the cinema and about 
 one third went regularly, one third   
 hardly ever go, and one third never   
 go. We asked them all if they owned   
 videos and two thirds of them did, but
 less than one third owned computers.  
 We asked them all the amount of time  
 they watched television and the       
 average was two and a half hours each 
 day. We asked people if they think    
 there is enough sport in North Yate.  
 Most think there is not enough but a  
 few think there is. We asked all of   
 them if they went on holiday          
 regularly; the vast majority said yes.
 A quarter go abroad.
