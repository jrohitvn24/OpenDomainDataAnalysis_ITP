		<title>11THE NEWSAGENTS</title>
		<content>    Catts is just down the road from   
 our Restaurant it is a Newsagents. It 
 is right in the middle of the High    
 Street and I get the Friday Ad. and my
 dad's paper from there every day. They
 sell toys, comics, drinks, models,    
 writing pads, pencils, erasers and    
 cards, and I get my sweets there after
 school.                               
    It is not a very big shop and it is
 being re-decorated at the moment. The 
 people are very nice and in the new   
 year other people are coming from     
 Turkey to take over the shop.         
    The shop is to become a mini-      
 market.                               
    It is a cosy place to shop and     
 there are lots of sweets to choose    
 from. At Christmas time you can buy   
 cards to send to your friends and you 
 could buy them small gifts.
