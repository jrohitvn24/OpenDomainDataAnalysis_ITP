		<title>07CHANGE IN INDUSTRY IN RYTON</title>
		<content> Coal mining was once a major industry 
 in the North East of England, begun in
 fact by the monks hundreds of years   
 ago. The last pit in the Ryton area,  
 Emma Pit, was closed in 1968 when     
 reserves were found to be exhausted.  
 There is much evidence of this        
 industry throughout the area. The old 
 Townley Main Railway line, which ran  
 from the fells above Hedley to the    
 staithes on the Tyne, is still        
 recognisable, and other old wagonways 
 near Greenside can also be traced.    
 The changing industry over the last   
 few years can be clearly seen where   
 Stargate Pit once stood. This site now
 has several small factories making a  
 variety of products. A building       
 supplies firm moved here to avoid high
 rates in Newcastle, anda firm         
 specialising in Computer hard and     
 software came here 16 years ago.      </content>
