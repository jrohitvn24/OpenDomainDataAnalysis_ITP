		<title>14THE BRIGHTON BY_PASS (1)</title>
		<content> If the Brighton by-pass is to be built
 ,it would start at Shoreham,and end at
 Falmer,Brighton.If it is built,it will
 ruin the South downs,an area of       
 historical interest and great beauty, 
 beauty which people come from all over
 Britain to see.Also,if it is built,   
 70ft slopes will be left,trees will be
 lost and animals will be killed;a     
 great disaster towards nature.The     
 Hangleton link,which wil link up the  
 by-pass to the A27 would cut straight 
 through the Hove Golf Club,another    
 place of great beauty,of historical   
 interest and a place of leisure to    
 many.There would be a jumction in the 
 middle of Stanmer Woods,which would   
 endanger the lives of pupils of Falmer
 School,as there would be more traffic 
 to look out for while crossing the    
 road to get to school.
