		<title>13BEVERTON FARM</title>
		<content> He still has quite a large vegetable  
 garden, we saw superb rhubarb,        
 potatoes, pears etc and he told me    
 that he usually makes his own jam and 
 sometimes wine. He has some jam left  
 from 1983.                            
 He used to exchange rhubarb for trout 
 caught by a fisherman in Clatworthy   
 reservoir but he has not seen him this
 year. It seemed to be a case of       
 swapping the trout and rhubarb over   
 the hedge when the fisherman passed!  
 In winters when it snows he does get  
 cut off but his new neighbours        
 who have been there three years have  
 taken him out to Wiveliscombe in their
 range rover.                          
 In the evenings he will read and      
 usually goes to bed about 9.00pm,     
 although he says he does not sleep too
 well.
