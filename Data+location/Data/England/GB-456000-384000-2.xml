		<content> About{one twelfth}of our block is     
 houses and built up areas.These are   
 the{villages of Wallingwells,Letwell  
 and{Carlton-in-Lindrick.}Each of      
 these villages has a variety of{semi- 
{detached,detached,semi-bungalows,     
{bungalows}and{terrace houses.}The most
 popular houses built in our block are 
{semi-detached}because they are cheaper
 and easier to build.The largest built 
 up area is{Carlton-in-Lindrick}because
 more people live there and there are  
 more facilities.{Wallingwells Hall    
 and some other old buildings are being
 renovated but none have been knocked  
 down.Susan lives in Letwell and her   
 house is the{'New Rectory'.}It is a   
{detached}house.It is built in the     
{orchard}of the{'Old Rectory'.}There   
 are three groups of{old peoples houses
 in{Carlton-in-Lindrick}and none in    
{Letwell and Wallingwells.             </content>
