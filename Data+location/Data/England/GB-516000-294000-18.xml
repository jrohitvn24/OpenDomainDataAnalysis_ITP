		<title>18Frankie's day - 2</title>
		<content>   At dinner time, 11.55 am., I walk   
 home with Andrew because he lives just
 a few houses away from me along our   
 terrace.  When I get home, Dad makes  
 my dinner and I watch it while        
 watching a bit of film taped on the   
 video.  At 12.30 pm. I return to      
 school and play marbles or football   
 until the bell goes at 1.10 pm.       
   We work till 3.30 pm and have play  
 for 15 minutes at 2.15 pm.  We work   
 each afternoon except Wednesday when  
 we have games for the first session.  
   When I arrive home after school I   
 make myself a sandwich, usually peanut
 butter and  watch television or a film
 on video.  I change into my old       
 trousers and call round for my friends
 and we either go to the 'rec' or mess 
 about down our street.  at 7.00 pm.   
 its evening meal time, some more TV, a
 shower and off to the land of dreams. </content>
