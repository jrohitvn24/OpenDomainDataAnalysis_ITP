		<content>On the Birkacre site there have been   
many industries going back to the      
Middle Ages. There was a fulling mill  
there in the (14 which was powered by a
water wheel. The water-fall which      
provided the water was constructed from
locally quarried mill-stone. There was 
a corn mill in the area which was      
powered by a donkey walk wheel. The    
district was rich in minerals, iron ore
being mined locally and smelted at a   
forge on Sunny Brow. The largest       
industry was coal mining which at one  
time employed approximately 1,000 men  
at 28 pits. A railway line ran from the
shafts to a weigh-bridge on Pall Mall. 
The coal was then loaded on to carts   
and distributed. A spinning mill and a 
bleach and a printing mill have also   
been sited here. Museums and a Leisure 
Park are to be set up to preserve the  
area's industrial history and beauty.  </content>
