		<content>  The proposed route of a{by-pass}to   
 divert the A46 road around Newark     
 passes close to houses and farmland in
 this block.                           
  The majority of residents object on  
 the following grounds:                
 a)Increased noise and pollution with  
 no offers of compensation.            
 b)Safety risk to pedestrians and      
 cyclists using Winthorpe Rd.          
 c)Detrimental{environmental}change    
 will adversely affect the market value
 of private properties.                
 One resident, a farmer,               
     vigorously objects to an          
 extension of the route which will take
 traffic to the A17 east of Coddington.
 The road will slice through his farm, 
 fragmenting his property,making the   
 movement of implements hazardous and  
 resulting in the loss of rich land to{
{agriculture .}                        </content>
