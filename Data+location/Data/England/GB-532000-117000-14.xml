		<title>14The Burgess Hill Clay Pits</title>
		<content>    The{Burgess Hill Clay Pits}are just
 off Kings Way. The pits provided clay 
 for bricks and tiles. They are now    
 waste-land and are used for fishing.  
    The{Keymer Tile Company}want to    
 fill them in with baled refuse. If    
 they were filled in, the land could be
 sold for building or other uses.      
    The residents don't want dumping of
 refuse because of rats, the smell of  
 the rubbish, the danger of lorries to 
 children and because it would look    
 ugly. The{East Burgess Hill Residents'
{Association}was formed to fight       
 against the tipping and has persuaded 
 the Council not to allow it.          
    People are still wondering what    
 will happen to the site. Some would   
 like a{golf course}and others a{park,}
 as there is a lack of open space on   
 the Folders Lane Estate.
