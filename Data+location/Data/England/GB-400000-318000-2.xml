		<content>My Mom and Dad came to Rugeley in 1972.
The reason was they were looking for a 
house to buy and in Birmingham where   
they come from the prices were too     
high. Looking through the papers they  
saw a bungalow advertised at a price   
nearer to what they could afford.      
Coming to see the bungalow, they liked 
it, and the area straight away; on     
looking around they found out that     
shops, schools and buses were all at   
hand. That is how they came to live at 
Rugeley.                               
My Dad is a fireman at Erdington. He   
has been working at this station for 3 
years though he's been a fireman for 21
years. He gets a medal next month for  
good conduct and service. Since joining
the fire service Dad has worked at     
Kings Norton, Billesley,Bordesley Green
Sutton Coldfield. Dad travels to work  
at 7.45am by car.                      </content>
