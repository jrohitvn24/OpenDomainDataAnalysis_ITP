		<title>11A TYPICAL WEEKEND</title>
		<content>{1 On Saturday}morning I looked at the 
 clock-9.45. Ah! stay in bed for       
 another hour. 2 minutes later mum said
 "Get out of bed". I went into my      
 brothers room. He was asleep.I put his
 hamster on his face and he woke up! We
 both made our beds and tidied our     
 rooms. We went down stairs to find our
 breakfast waiting for us. I watched   
 "Saturday Morning Picture Show" then I
 watched "Freeze Frame".               
{2 On Sunday}I get up between 10 &amp; 11am
 I go to Martins at about 12.15pm and  
 just get there before they close.We   
 have roast dinner at about 1pm.I help 
 to wash &amp; dry the dishes with my Dad. 
 Usually we lounge about all day and at
 3pm I do some cooking. I make cakes   
 and rock buns. At 5pm we get tea ready
 and I muck around until 8.45,watching 
 T.V.and getting my bag ready for      
 school.                               </content>
