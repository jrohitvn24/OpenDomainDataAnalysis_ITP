		<content> DR HOLLAND,THE BLAKENEY DOCTOR,HAS    
 2,700 PATIENTS ON HIS LIST AND COVERS 
 A RADIUS OF 5 MILES. HIS CLOSE WORK   
 WITH DR DUKES AT NEWNHAM MEANS HE CAN 
 TAKE OFF MORE TIME THAN THE OLD       
 COUNTRY DOCTORS. DR HOLLAND HAS BEEN  
 COVERING AWRE FOR JUST OVER FIVE      
 YEARS,AND CHOOSE THE AREA FOR HIS     
 PRACTICE BECAUSE IT WAS STABLE AND A  
 BEAUTIFUL AREA. HE HAD BECOME A DOCTOR
 AFTER 9 YEARS,FOUR YEARS WORKING IN A 
 HOSPITAL. ALTHOUGH IT WAS A COUNTRY   
 AREA,HE WANTED TO BUY NEW EQUIPMENT TO
 IMPROVE THE PRACTICE,TRYING TO        
 INTRODUCE COMPUTERS FOR LISTING HIS   
 PATIENTS PROBLEMS. HIS HOBBY THOUGH   
 WAS A STUDY OF THE AREAS HISTORY;HE   
 COLLECTS OLD PHOTOGRAPHS AND SHOWED US
 HOW AWRE LOOKED IN 1887.
