		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF BLOCK</title>
		<content> This block consists of a mixture of   
 woodland,mainly plantations, and      
 farmland, and it is split in two by   
 the main A 380 road to Torbay,        
 currently being improved. The higher  
 land,above 200 metres approximately,  
 is predominantly woodland on          
 the poorer soils of Upper             
 Greensand.Much of this woodland is in 
 the form of coniferous plantations    
 forming part of Exeter Forest.On the  
 slopes below this greensand           
 ridge,soils are better and the land   
 use is a mixture of pasture and       
 arable.Settlement consists of a number
 of scattered farms,and the small      
 hamlet OF ASHCOMBE,population         
 117.There has been some depopulation  
 of this area this century.There are no
 permanent shops or services.
