		<title>18THE DEER FARM,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  My father owns a deer farm near      
 Withernsea.The animals,all red deer,  
 are kept on 22 acres of land split    
 into 5 paddocks.There are 60 hinds and
 27 stags and this year 53 calves have 
 been born.When born they hide in the  
 grass,just as they would in the wild, 
 to protect themselves from enemies. We
 have to find them quickly to weigh    
 them and put an identification tag in 
 their ear before they become too      
 difficult to catch! The deer mate in  
 autumn and the calves are born in     
 summer. During the winter the deer are
 put indoors and fed on nuts,hay and   
 silage. During the summer they are put
 out to graze. The stags lose their    
 antlers in winter, but grow them again
 in the autumn ready for the rutting or
 mating season.
