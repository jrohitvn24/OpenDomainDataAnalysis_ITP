		<content>{ Broxton Wood}is a very interesting   
 place to go for a walk.There are many 
 kinds of trees,flowers,fungi,birds and
 animals to see and it is very peaceful
  Once there was a coal mine and a     
 stone quarry there,so it must have    
 been a very busy and noisy place.The  
 coal mine closed at the turn of the   
 century and when the miners left the  
 four little cottages where they stayed
 were added onto and made into a wood  
 side cottage where Shep the dog and   
{Mr.and Mrs.Dorricott}now live.        
  When you walk in the woods,following 
 the rabbit tracks,you find coal and   
 beautiful fossils with fern and shells
 in them so you can think about the    
 world and the way it was made.
