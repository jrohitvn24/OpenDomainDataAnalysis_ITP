		<content>  {Hedgerows }are along the road at    
 Barteliver nettles are abundant and   
 provide good breeding ground for      
 butterflies.Kestrels were observed on 
 the farmland looking for small mammals
 in the fields.Two pairs of pheasants  
 were also observed but neither were   
 with chicks (May).                    
   In the{Woodland}at Golden Wood      
 partridges and ringed pheasants are   
 kept by the gamekeeper.Golden,Carveth 
 and Pomery wood's are all deciduous.In
 Golden Wood only a few small birds    
 were observed,possibly because of a   
 resident buzzard.Carveth wood has a   
 high tree canopy where small birds    
 live.                                 
   On the{Farmland},kestrels are quite 
 common,with the occasional buzzard.In 
 this area farms maintain old hedges   
 instead of fencing,provideing a       
 habitat for mammals.                  </content>
