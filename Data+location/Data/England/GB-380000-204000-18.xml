		<title>18RELIGION IN WEST OF STROUD</title>
		<content> The main Religion in our part of      
 Stroud is Church of England.  Roman   
 Catholicism has the next biggest      
 number of members.  These are followed
 by Methodists, Baptists,              
 Congregationalists and other small    
 church groups.  There are four        
 Anglican Churches, two Baptist        
 Churches, two Roman Catholic Churches,
 one Methodist Church and a Pentecostal
 Church.  There is also a church of    
 Bethel at Stonehouse.  There are no   
 meeting places for religions of other 
 cultures.  There are active Jehovah's 
 Witnesses in the areas, a Spiritualist
 group, a Quaker group and a           
 Presbyterian group.  For many people, 
 religion plays very little part in    
 their daily lives except for          
 christenings, marriages and funerals.
