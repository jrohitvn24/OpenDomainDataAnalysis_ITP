		<content>  There is lots of wildlife in the     
 area. Many wild birds come to the     
 school bird tables to be fed in       
 winter and there are many pheasants in
 the surrounding fields.               
  Hares and rabbits are often seen too 
 and often eat flowers and vegetables  
 growing in the gardens. There ars     
 small muntjac deer and also many      
 fallow deer mainly in small groups but
 sometimes in a large herd.These fallow
 deer raid gardens too even when they  
 are gaurded by an electric fence. They
 are not often seen close to but       
 sometimes their footprints can be seen
 in the snow very close to the houses. 
 They are particularly fond on windfall
 apples in autumn.
