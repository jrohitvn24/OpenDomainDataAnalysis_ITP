		<content> Communication is telling someone      
 something.                            
 Voice communication:face to face,     
 telephone or C.B.radio. People in our 
 village have meetings to communicate  
 ideas about what we do.               
 We surveyed twenty-five families      
 and discovered that everyone had a    
 telephone. Seven families owned a C.B 
 radio. Most people talk to their      
 friends on the telephone and some     
 people write letters. Businesses use  
 the postal and package services       
 like White Arrow and Securicor, as    
 well as the national service.         
  The government communicates with     
 us by radio and television and we get 
 news by satellite from other          
 countries. Some people use computers  
 to pass information to each other at  
 high speed around the world.
