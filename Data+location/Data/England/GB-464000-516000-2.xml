		<content>      We made a{survey}of the traffic  
 for the main coastal route from Whitby
 to Guisborough{(A173),}at Skelton on  
{Wednesday 3rd. July}between 9.0 am.   
 and 3.0pm.                            
      Throughout these hours we found  
 there was a{greater traffic flow}to   
 the{west}of the country than to the   
 east, by about{10%.}This suggests many
 vehicles use Saltburn Lane (North from
 664190) probably for access to the    
 housing and industrial estates, or to 
 the coast.                            
      Overall{traffic-flow,}both east  
 and west, equalled{350 to 400 vehicles
{an hour(vph)}in each direction. After 
{9.0am}traffic built up from a steady  
 flow of{700vph.,}subsided slightly to 
 about{600vph. at 12.0,}building up to 
{800 vehicles at 3.0pm.                
                                       
                                       </content>
