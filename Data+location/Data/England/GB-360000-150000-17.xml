		<title>17Stone Stiles of Emborough</title>
		<content> Stone stiles set in dry stone walls   
 are a familiar sight at Emborough and 
 neighbouring parishes where footpaths 
 link hamlets an villages.  They are   
 constructed of a large slab of stone  
 set vertically into the ground over   
 which one has to climb, aided by steps
 of square blocks of stone on either   
 side. These are cattleproof and easily
 maintainalbe.  In the past these      
 stiles and footpaths were used daily  
 by farm and quary workers returning to
 and from their work.  Today however it
 is mainlly ramblers that are seen to  
 use them and therefore most are kept  
 in place, maintained and cleared of   
 biars and hedgerows that would        
 otherwise engulf those which lie in   
 fields off the beaten track.
