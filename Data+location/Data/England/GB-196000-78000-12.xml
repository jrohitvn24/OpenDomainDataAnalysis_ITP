		<title>12Birds and Beasts</title>
		<content> The most common birds in the area are 
 gulls and  starlings. These are       
 successful because their food is      
 plentiful.The peregrine falcon is the 
 rarest breeding bird.There are now    
 no wild choughs as in the war farmer  
 ploughed up the land near the cliffs  
 and destroyed their feeding grounds.  
 The rabbits got myximatosis and died  
 The buzzards had no food and became   
 rare, but they are now on the increase
 again.Owls are also having a hard time
 because the farmers are knocking down 
 the old barns and building new ones   
 which are not suitable for them to    
 nest in. The coast is important for   
 breeding seabirds such as puffins     
 guillimots razorbills and an          
 increasing number of fulmars.There are
 many small mammals such as voles      
 shrews and mice. There are also badger
 and foxes and breeding grey seals.    </content>
