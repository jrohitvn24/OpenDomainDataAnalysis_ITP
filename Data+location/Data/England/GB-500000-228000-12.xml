 six people. Many are either family    
 businesses, or owned and run by one   
 person. Most industries sell their

 farm, a nursery which grows most of   
 the plants it sells, a new and used   
 farm machinery sales firm, and a meat 
 packing company. Other industries of  
 a more general nature include a baker,
 four builders, three furniture        
 manufacturers, a fencing contractor,  
 two small potteries, a motor body
