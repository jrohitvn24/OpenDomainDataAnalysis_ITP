		<content>    The temperate climate enables      
 Scilly to have its' great variety of  
 flora and fauna, much of which cannot 
 be found elsewhere in the U.K..There  
 is also very little pollution here.   
 The scenery is beautiful both in      
 summer when it appears a tropical     
 paradise and in winter when fierce    
 gales and storms have a dramatic      
 appeal.There is a footpath around the 
 whole coastline and this area is very 
 popular with walkers.This area        
 attracts many ornithologists who like 
 to see the great variety of seabirds  
 and the migrants and other rare       
 species that frequent these islands in
 the spring and autumn.Seals are also  
 to be seen and the area is also a     
 great attraction to divers who enjoy  
 the clear water and interesting marine
 life and shipwrecks.
