		<content>   In Eastchurch we found more         
{semi-detached houses}than any other   
 types, 42, compared to 33 detached and
 38 terraced.                          
   There is a school house which       
 belongs to the school.                
   Numbers 113 - 123 High Street are   
 Airey Houses which are semi-detached  
 and built of pre-fabricated concrete  
 blocks. These houses were built just  
 after World War II.                   
   Numbers 104 - 120 High Street were  
 also built at this time and were      
{council houses}but are now privately  
 owned.                                
   In the old terraced{housing}along   
 Church road the people's{families}have
 lived there a long time. The newly    
 built estate along Bramley Way is     
 occupied by people whose families     
 haven't lived in the area very long.
