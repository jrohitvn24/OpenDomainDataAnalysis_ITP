		<title>11 Fruit Farming (3)</title>
		<content>The yearly round of farming tasks was  
described to us by the farm manager as 
follows: In the winter the pruning     
and applying of herbicides takes place 
and the clearing and shredding of      
prunings.Fertiliser has to be applied  
in spinner pellet form.Spraying takes  
place every 10 days from the end of    
March to August.Air blast machines are 
used for this.Young trees have straw   
and dung put round the base of the     
trunk.This is called mulching.Some     
summer pruning is carried              
out.Branches are tied down to          
encourage outward growth.Fruit         
thinning takes place in early          
summer.Warm weather is hoped for in    
spring,not the cold dry winds of       
1985's spring.Finally harvesting takes 
place; all, of course, carried out by  
hand.                                  
                                       </content>
