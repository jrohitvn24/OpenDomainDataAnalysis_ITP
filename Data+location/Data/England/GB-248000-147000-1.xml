		<title>01SUMMARY OF AREA.</title>
		<content> Ilfracombe is a town of 10,000 people 
 many of whom are elderly.The area is  
 very attractive with much farmland,   
 cliff and sea.The town grew in late   
 Victorian times because it was a      
 seaside resort.Today it still attracts
 many visitors and a lot of local jobs 
 are connected with tourism.In the     
 summer the population rises to 25,000 
 and the town becomes very busy.In the 
 winter there is much wind and rain    
 and if it snows the town can easily   
 become cut off.Unemployment rises in  
 the winter to 25% and everywhere is   
 very quiet.There is not much flat     
 land in this area and a lot of the    
 streets are quite steep.There are a   
 lot of churches in this area as well  
 as pubs.A recent local issue concerns 
 the fouling of pavements by dogs.Also 
 local people are worried about public 
 transport.                            </content>
