 In Urchfont there are three types of  
 rock.Clay,chalk and greensand which   
 the main part of Urchfont is settled  
 on.The village is situated on the     
 greensand because it is fertile and if
 it was on chalk there wouldn't be any 
 water for a mile or so and if it was  
 on clay it would be too wet because   
 the water soaks through the chalk and 
 through the greensand and hits the    
 clay and it can't go through.So it    
 turns to the north and comes out to   
 make a spring on the escarpment       
 between greensand and clay.Around     
 Urchfont we grow cereals because it   
 isn'too dry or wet and is easy to     
 plough.But on the clay it is hard to  
 plough and wet so they grow grass for 
 cattle.In the greensand you  can find 
 a hard stone called malmstone which   
 was used for building(with other      </content>
