   First settled in the Iron Age, a    
 farming community developed during    
 Roman times and the Munt, a local     
 curiosity, was probably a burial mound
 of a wealthy farmer from that period. 
 Strips of farmland in later times     
 shaped the local fields and after the 
 Norman invasion the land was given to 
 the de Harcourt family. The original  
 Domesday survey of 1086 shows an early
 medieval village with boundaries very 
 similar to those of today. The        
 settlement then was surrounded by a   
 ditch and mound with a timber palisade
 to keep out wild animals.             
   The houses were wooden and mud huts 
 with thatched roofs, the old House    
 still surviving from 1678 being the   
 first brick one in the village.
