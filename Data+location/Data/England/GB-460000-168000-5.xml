		<title>05THE A4 TO AND FROM THATCHAM</title>
		<content> This road is part of the Great West   
 Road from London to Bristol. Today it 
 is the main road from Newbury and     
 Thatcham to Reading and it is greatly 
 used by vehicles going onto the       
 M4(Junction 12). 376 vehicles went    
 onto the A4(Thatcham) from the        
 roundabout. 270 had come from the     
 Theale by-pass, 16 from Wigmore Lane, 
 73 from the A340, 13 from the         
 A4(Theale) and 4 went once round the  
 roundabout. 592 vehicles went onto the
 roundabout from the A4(Thatcham). 480 
 had come from the Theale by-pass, 13  
 from Wigmore Lane, 68 from the A340,  
 27 from the A4(Theale) and 4 had gone 
 once round the roundabout. The major  
 problem presented by this road is the 
 difficulty for pedestrians going to   
 and from Wigmore Lane.
