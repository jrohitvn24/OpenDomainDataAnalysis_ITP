		<title>05A Vets Day      (J.Bell)</title>
		<content> It is soon after 7 and so far the     
 phone has not rung,like two days ago  
 when I had to rush from my cosy bed to
 an early morning milk fever.If I hurry
 I can feed my young calves and quickly
 check my small flock of sheep,before  
 grabbing a bowl of cereal and driving 
 to the surgery eating a piece of toast
 on the way.This morning a phone call  
 asks me to stop on the way to see a   
 lamb which is"tucked up"so a case of  
 enteritis is dealt with on the        
 roadside.                             
      At morning surgery two pups are  
 vaccinated,a cat with a bite wound and
 a ewe having difficulty lambing are   
 seen to,and a glance at the day book  
 reveals two phone calls to be made    
 before a welcome cup of coffee.At ten 
 o'clock I drive six miles to a farm   
 where every bovine has been rounded up
 for the annual ministry test.         </content>
