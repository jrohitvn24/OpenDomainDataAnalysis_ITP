		<content>        When the bell goes for morning 
 playtime we go onto the playground for
 fifteen minutes.After play we have    
 reading time followed by maths until  
 dinner time.Some children stay at     
 school to eat sandwiches,others have  
 school dinners,but I am one of those  
 who go home.I go to my Grandad's.     
 School usually starts at one o'clock, 
 but I come for my swimming group at   
 12.45.After playtime we have singing  
 together until the end of school,when 
 I go home and wait for my Dad to come 
 home from work.I watch television     
 until my Mum gets in at 5.30 and then 
 go out to play with my friends.At 8.30
 I come back home for my supper and    
 watch television until 9.30 and then I
 go to bed.
