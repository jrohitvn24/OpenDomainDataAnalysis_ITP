		<content>  Smeaton's Tower stands on Plymouth   
 Hoe as a permanent reminder of the    
 hazards of the sea which men have     
 experienced from earliest             
 times.Originally,built over two       
 hundred years ago,it was one of a     
 succession of four lighthouses,it     
 was built                             
 fourteen miles to the S.W. of Plymouth
 by John Smeaton. Its purpose was      
 to warn sailors of the Eddystone Reef.
  The upper half of the tower was      
 dismantled stone by stone and         
 re_erected on The Hoe.
