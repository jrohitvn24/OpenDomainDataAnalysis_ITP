The people who work at Thurlow Nunn    
call themselves agricultural engineers.
The firm started in the name of Nunn 34
years ago in 1951. 17 years later in   
1968 they joined up with another       
company called Thurlow and that's how  
they became Thurlow Nunn. They usally  
sell and repair Massey Fergussons and a
small Japanese tractor called a Kubota.
Overall they have 25 people working at 
Thurlow Nunn and only two of them are  
ladies. Agricultural engineers evolved 
from the village blacksmiths. There    
work involves: buying, selling,        
repairing and instructing farmers on   
how to use their machinery. Everyone at
Thurlow Nunn seems to enjoy their work.
