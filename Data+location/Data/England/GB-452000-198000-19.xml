		<title>19Radley and the Church</title>
		<content>The Church of St. James the Great has  
dominated the village since ****. It   
is a focal point of village life,      
solely providing for the village's     
(Church of England) religious needs:-  
3 services each Sunday, 2 each         
weekday; baptisms, confirmations,      
marriages and funerals. The Vicar and  
the Chaplain of Radley College both    
take services for the Primary School,  
Mondays and Thursdays. The Church      
embraces an active bell ringing team,  
and a choir of 30, for Radley services 
and also Deanery and Diocesan          
Festivals, and jointly with other      
parishes. There is a Women's           
Fellowship, a Women's Institute, and a 
Thursday Group which does charitable   
work. There are Junior and Senior      
Church Youth Groups, and a thriving    
Sunday School. A new Church Room was   
recently build for own &amp; hired uses.   </content>
