		<content>  When it is playtime we sometimes play
{'twang'}or{'Hot-rice'}.When you play  
{Hot-rice}you try to hit the person's  
 legs with a ball but if it hits the   
 top of your leg you are not out,but if
 it hits between your foot and your    
 knee you are out.                     
  You play{Hot-rice}with a small ball  
 like a tennis ball.                   
  Quite a lot of girls are keen on{    
{Twang}.All you need is some elastic   
 and tie a Knot in the ends and then   
 two people stand at each end.The first
 person stands at the side and puts    
 their right foot into the middle of   
 the elastic,then their left foot and  
 take their right foot to the right    
 side of the twang.Many girls have     
 twangs because it is a popular game.
