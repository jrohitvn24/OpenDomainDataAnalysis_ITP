		<content> In autumn right through to spring i   
 play {rugger} at newbold R.F.C. We    
 usualy play every sunday. Last season 
 we played 6 matches. That may not seem
 a lot but it is condsidering we did'nt
 start till December. We only won two  
 matches out of the six matches and    
 next season we are hoping for more    
 matches. In 1985 i went to see        
 Coventry versus Aston villa it was a  
 good afternoon. Just before half time 
 Withe scored his first goal. In the   
 second half Withe scored again and {  
  Walters scored. At full time it was  
 Aston villa 3 Coventry 0.             
 In the 1985 Embasy World Snooker      
 Championships i went to see the match 
 between Alex Higgins and Terry        
 Griffiths. We went because my uncle   
 lived in sheffield. In the end Terry  
 Griffiths won.                        
                                       </content>
