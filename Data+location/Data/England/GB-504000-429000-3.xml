		<title>03HULL FAIR, 1</title>
		<content> Apart from the public house this area 
 is poorly served regarding            
 entertainment. However, once a year a 
 travelling fair comes. It arrives on  
 the Saturday nearest to October 11th  
 and stays for a week.{Hull Fair}is a  
 great tradition and people from many  
 miles away travel to join in the fun  
 or to provide rides and sideshows. It 
 is the last of the large travelling   
 fairs and comes directly from         
 Nottingham Goose Fair. Hull Fair was  
 traditionally a horse fair but is now 
 puely a fun fair. It has been         
 suggested that it be moved from its   
 traditional{Walton Street}site across 
 the city but this has met with strong 
 opposition.                           
    Hull Fair dates from{1299}when     
{Edward 1st}when he granted a{Charter} 
 permitting both a fair and a market.
