		<title>04Royal Naval Store Depot</title>
		<content> The Depot occupies a site of          
 approximately 80 acres which was      
 formerly part of the Exeter Golf and  
 Country Club. It was built in 1944    
 during the Second World War by an     
 American support unit for use in the  
 preparation for the D Day landings.   
 The Depot currently employs about a   
 100 people and stores electrical and  
 general goods. They are mainly used by
 the Royal Navy for its transport and  
 general needs.                        
 Stores arrive by road and are checked 
 in one shed and then delivered to     
 appropriate stores. Ships put in their
 requisitions for stores               
 which are then packed and delivered by
 National Carriers, Navy vehicles, by  
 rail or air.
