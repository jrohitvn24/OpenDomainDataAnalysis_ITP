		<title>19ALL SAINT'S CHURCH OCKBROOK</title>
		<content> The varying materials used in the     
 construction of All Saint's church    
 make it a most interesting building.  
 The original building,chancel,nave    
 and western tower,are of very old     
 stone.The spire which was restored in 
 1894 is a low octagonal one.About     
 1815, a North aisle was built from red
 brick.Stone blocks were used to build 
 the south aisle in 1835.The Norman    
 font which was re-installed in 1963   
 indicates that there was a church on  
 this site as early as the 11th        
 century.The choir has a very strong   
 influence on the life of the          
 church.At its peak membership         
 numbered 46 ,with a waiting list, lady
 members being most numerous.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
