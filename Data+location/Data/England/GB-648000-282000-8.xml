		<title>08Two Carpenters</title>
		<content> Our Dad is a carpenter and he makes   
 things out of wood. Recently he made a
 cot. He also sometimes works in his   
 friend's chemist shop and then he     
 comes home very late. On Saturdays and
 Sundays he doesn't work. We go out on 
 Saturdays. We go to town in the       
 morning. On Sundays he stays in bed.  
 Then on Monday he can go to work again
 or go and help his friend.

 My Dad is a carpenter. He has his own 
 workshop.He has lots of machines and  
 they are very dangerous. Although he  
 works by himself he works very        
 quickly.
