		<title>05Wimborne Minster.</title>
		<content> The main tourist attraction for the   
 town of Wimborne is the Minster itself
 which is very old. Parts of it are    
 Norman. We went by coach from school  
 to see the Minster. First of all we   
 saw the Astronomical Clock. The clock 
 still tells the time by the sun. I    
 liked the Ettricke tomb which is in an
 unusual place in the wall. We saw some
 beautiful windows. The west window has
 twelve saints.We were lucky to go up  
 in the chained library to see some    
 very old books chained up. We saw the 
 lectern in the shape of an eagle. It  
 had the Bible on it. The only brass in
 the church was of King Ethelred,      
 brother of King Alfred. The Minster   
 was crowded with visitors. As we came 
 out,we heard the quarterjack strike   
 the hour.
