		<title>10St Mary's Church.</title>
		<content> The Church of St. Mary the Virgin     
 stands on the eastern slope of the    
 village hill, about 700 feet above sea
 -level. Various buildings have adorned
 the site, while the original of the   
 name belongs to the{13th century.}The 
 building was thoroughly restored in   
 1832.{In 1907 the Church was further  
{restored and embellished with much of 
{its present furnishings.}In 1921, the 
 Lych Gate was erected as a memorial to
 the Fallen of the First World War. The
 stained glass windows show the dates  
 and dedications, apart from the West  
 window, which was given by a member of
 the Hunting family of Slaley Hall.{The
{Parish Registers}date back from 1703  
 and record the names of several great 
 families in the village and illustrate
 the occupations of parishioners, such 
 as Clogger, Weaver, Miller, Smelter,  
 Husbandman and Farmer.                </content>
