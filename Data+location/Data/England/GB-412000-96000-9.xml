		<title>09THE AVON CAUSEWAY</title>
		<content>    The{River Avon}runs straight       
 through our area from north to south  
 and it creates problems with          
 communications between{Hurn}in the    
 west and{Sopley}in the east. There    
 is one road which crosses the river   
 and this has been raised above the    
 level of the flood plain. This is the 
 only bridging point on the eight mile 
 stretch between the A.35 at {         
{Christchurch}and the A.31 at{Ringwood.
{  } At the edge of the flood plain on 
 the heathland which rises up towards  
 the{Ramsdown Plantation}and this is   
 where the{Christchurch}to{Ringwood}   
 railway used to run. The old{Hurn     
{station}has now been turned into a    
 public house (The Avon Causeway) and  
 there is also a poultry farm and a    
 church nearby.
