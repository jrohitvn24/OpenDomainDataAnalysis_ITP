		<title>20SESSAY - A CARING VILLAGE</title>
		<content> People in Sessay are most generous.   
{Internationally}we have supported     
 Thirsk Deanery Appeals in Africa and  
 India.  Vests have been knitted for   
 Ethiopia and a blind African child has
 been supported for one year.  There is
 an annual collection for Christian    
 Aid.                                  
{Nationally}and{locally,}carol singing 
 has supported research projects,child-
 rens societies and hospital appeals. A
 sale of work by the blind, Christingle
 services for C of E Children's Society
 and collections for Red Cross &amp; Poppy 
 Day also raise money. Sunday Club's   
 concert was for a children's hospice. 
 Money has been raised by a sponsored  
 walk, an attic auction, a barbecue and
 family bingo for a school computer,   
 school funds, &amp; repairs to Lych gate. 
 Some ladies help in a thrift shop     
 which supports a local Cheshire Home. </content>
