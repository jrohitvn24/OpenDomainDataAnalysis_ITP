		<title>01Trumpington - G. Shelford</title>
		<content>    The Great Shelford to Trumpington  
 road (A1301) is surrounded on either  
 side by clustered housing. The waste  
 land on both sides of the houses      
 leads on to arable ground to the East.
                                       
    In the distance is a{forestry      
 plantation which carries on beyond the
 horizon. This square is mainly pasture
 and crops.                            
{                                      
    The{housing}along the road         
 is fairly linear and is surrounded by 
 one large field on both sides leading 
 to the forestry plantation. In the    
 middle of the plantation are a series 
 of high rise offices, enclosed by pine
 trees on three sides. It is mainly    
 pasture and forestry plantation.
