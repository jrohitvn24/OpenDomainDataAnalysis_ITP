The railway which used to come to      
RAUNDS was the Kettering to Cambridge  
line. It was built about 1870 and      
closed in 1962. It was a single track  
railway. The trains on the line were   
pulled by steam locomotives which used 
coal and water for their power. The    
trains carried passengers and freight. 
The freight was used by local factories
and works. Coal was brought in to go to
the shoe factories, peoples' homes and 
the gasworks. The coal that went to    
the peoples' homes was put into sacks  
at THORPE HOUSE FARM. The coal that    
went to the gasworks was heated up to  
make gas for the town. The old gasworks
is now part of Raunds Tannery. All that
is left now are the bridges, the       
embankments and the old station, which 
is now a private house. It is very     
pleasant to walk along the line.       </content>
