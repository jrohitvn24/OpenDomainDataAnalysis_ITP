		<content>  The resident vicar of St Mary's was  
 the Reverend Gabb, who came in the    
 1830s and stayed for 41 years.        
 Churchyard extension in 1855          
 accommodated graves of Indian Civil   
 Servants, naval men and the Irish of  
 whom there were a large local         
 population at the time. Parish        
 possessions include an old font, two  
 coats of arms, an oak parish chest    
 dating from the time of the Crusades, 
 a peal of bells and a Victorian pulpit
 and lectern. 19th century church      
 schools included one for girls and the
 Higgs Charity which accepted six boys 
 to study for three years. The Higgs   
 Charity still exists as a local       
 educational trust, known as the Higgs-
 Cooper Charity, which gives grants to 
 local schools for a wide range of     
 activities.
