		<title>09SEA RESCUE, SIDMOUTH</title>
		<content> On Friday the 21st of June the        
 Exmouth Lifeboat was called out to    
 rescue a 40ft yacht that was in danger
 of being driven ashore at Sidmouth.   
 The ketch Vamoss 2 was swept towards  
 cliffs in force 6 winds when she sent 
 out a distress call. The Caroline     
 Finch lifeboat was launched and the   
 crew reported that they had           
 succesfully placed a line aboard the  
 yacht and were towing her clear of the
 shore. The Caroline Finch lifeboat is 
 not allowed out to a rescue if the    
 weather is too rough. She is a brede  
 class boat which must not be sent out 
 in a force 8 onshore wind during the  
 day or a force 7 at night. This is    
 because the brede boats are produced  
 as intermediate lifeboats. In case the
 Exmouth can't go out due to weather   
 conditions the Weymouth or Torbay     
 boats take over.                      </content>
