		<title>01AIMS OF THE SURVEY</title>
		<content> OUR AREA LIES BETWEEN THE TOWN OF     
 HEATHFIELD AND THE SMALL TYPICAL      
 SUSSEX VILLAGES OF MAYFIELD AND FIVE  
 ASHES. THE AREA DOES NOT COMPRISE ANY 
 OF THE BUILT UP AREAS AND CONSISTS    
 MOSTLY OF FARMS AND ISOLATED HOUSES   
 SET IN THE UNDULATING COUNTRYSIDE OF  
 THE WEALD OF KENT AND SUSSEX. A FEW   
 MINOR ROADS CRISS-CROSS THE AREA WITH 
 THE DISUSED MAYFIELD TO HEATHFIELD    
 RAILWAY LINE RUNNING NORTH / SOUTH.   
 THE POPULATION CONSISTS OF FAIRLY     
 PROSPEROUS FARMERS AND RETIRED        
 PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE. OUR SURVEY WAS   
 AIMING TO REFLECT THE WAY OF LIFE OF  
 AN EAST SUSSEX RURAL COMMUNITY, THEIR 
 USE OF THE LAND AND THEIR ATTITUDES TO
 LIFE. DESCRIPTIONS OF THE IMMEDIATE   
 SURROUNDINGS AND A FEW TYPICAL HOUSES 
 SHOULD ENABLE ONE TO GET A PICTURE OF 
 THE VEGETATION, WILD LIFE AND OF THE  
 LIVING CONDITIONS SURROUNDING US.     </content>
