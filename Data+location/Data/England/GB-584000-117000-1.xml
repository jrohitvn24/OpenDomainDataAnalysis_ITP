 Our grid reference takes in about     
 three quarters of the village of      
 Udimore,plus some farm-land on its    
 Western boundary.  Our remarks will   
 therefore be mainly devoted to Udimore
 itself. It is a very long village,    
 really consisting of several separate 
 settlements strung out along the ridge
 between the Brede and Tillingham      
 valleys. In the whole village there   
 are 324 people, with a high proportion
 of elderly people.  We are part of a  
 designated 'Area of Outstanding       
 Natural Beauty' and certainly there   
 are some wonderful views across both  
 valleys.We are three miles from the   
 market town of Rye and twelve from    
 Hastings, the major town of the area. 
 It is said that we are the second     
 longest village in England, Stukely in
 Buckinghamshire being the first.      </content>
