		<title>10MAYOR OF FAIRFORD</title>
		<content>  {Mrs Paton}has been the{mayor of     
{Fairford}since the beginning of June. 
  Her role involves looking after      
 council matters and dealing with local
 problems.   Fairford has become a town
 because it was felt that Tetbury      
 nearly the same size was getting      
 priority because of its status as a   
 town.  {Milton Farm}where Mrs Paton   
 lives, is mainly an arable one.   She 
 said that at one time she had enjoyed 
 milking cows and rearing orphan lambs 
 but with the increase in highly       
 technical farm machinery she is now   
 not so directly involved in the day to
 day workings of the farm.   Mrs Paton 
 is actively involved with the network 
 of{W.I. markets}of which there are    
 about twenty in the area.   She is a  
{Governor of Farmor's school and the   
{Primary school.}  She enjoys both     
 gardening and bowls.                  </content>
