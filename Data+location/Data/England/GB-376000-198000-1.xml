		<title>01Review of our Block.</title>
		<content> Our block is in the South of the      
 county of Gloucestershire. The nearest
 large cities and towns are; Bristol to
 the South,Stroud,Cheltenham and       
 Gloucester to the North. The area is  
 predominantly rural,being situated in 
 the Cotswold Hills,and is an area of  
 outstanding natural beauty.Spectacular
 views of the Severn Estuary can be    
 seen on clear days. There are no large
 settlements in the block,the biggest  
 being the village of Uley,which has a 
 population of about 1,500. Industry in
 the block is mainly                   
 agricultural,although there are a few 
 cottage industries. The area has one  
 primary school in the village of Uley,
 which has 96 children on roll at      
 present.The area is steeped in        
 history,with Iron Age and Roman       
 remains centred mainly round the      
 village of Uley.                      </content>
