 few houses on both sides of a narrow  
 country lane.There are 3 small        
 cottages with tiny gardens,each       
 separated by low hedges.One cottage   
 has its door at the side of the house 
 and a vegetable patch at the back.    
 Another cottage has its front door    
 directly onto the road.The door bell  
 is a metal pole with a handle to      
 pull.                                 
   There is a pig farm.From the gateway
 can be seen stone buildings with      
 broken wooden doors.Another farm has a
 long driveway,a large lawned garden,  
 out-houses to one side and otherwise  
 surrounded by fields.                 
   There are very few people about     
 during the daytime,most inhabitants   
 being at school or at work in         
 Leeds,Harrogate or Bradford.
