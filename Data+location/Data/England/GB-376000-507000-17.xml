		<title>17THE TUP SALES.</title>
		<content> The {tup sales }go on for three days. 
 This year it was wet windy when the   
 class visited them on Friday 19"      
 October, the last day. When we got    
 inside it was noisy. There was a warm 
 smell. The{auctioneer,Stuart Bell,}was
 always shouting out the price of the  
 tup.The farmers were discussing their 
 tups. They have crooks and wear       
 similar cloths,like green body        
 warmers,checked shirts,brown trousers 
 and green wellingtons and caps.       
 The sheep they are selling are        
 pedigree  {Swaledale Rams.}We call    
 them tups.The highest price that has  
 been paid for one is{Â£16,000,}but most
 of them make a few hundred pounds     
 each.The auction  is organized by     
{Penrith Farmers and Kidds Limited}&amp; is
 held in the  auction mart on Faraday  
 Road. It was once held in the streets.
 Farmers come from all over Britain.   </content>
