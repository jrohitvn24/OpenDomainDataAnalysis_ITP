		<content>{A Day in the life of Mrs. Bennett.}   
 Mrs. Bennett is our school cook and   
 dinner lady. The group I work in      
 interviewed her.                      
 Mrs. Bennett lives in Lydd Green and  
 she likes living there. At school she 
 enjoys talking to the children.At home
 she enjoys going to dog shows and     
 walking in the peacefullness of the   
 countryside. In her spare time she    
 likes watching television, Knitting,  
 going for walks, going to dog shows   
 and doing odd jobs.                   
 In the morning she gets up early and  
 does odd jobs in the house, then she  
 goes to school.
