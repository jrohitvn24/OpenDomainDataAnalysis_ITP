		<title>03VILLAGE LIFE, WENSLEYDALE</title>
		<content> The three villages we studied are very
 attractive and most people we         
 interviewed felt that they are good   
 places in which to live. All have     
 village greens which are centres of   
 village activity, especially in the   
 summer. Each village also has its own 
 village hall. In the summer months    
 each village has a Fete with sports,  
 stalls, teas and other attractions. A 
 Committee is formed to organise this  
 event. In winter there are whist and  
 domino drives and some dances in the  
 village halls. There are evening      
 classes and occasional lectures and   
 concerts organised by various groups. 
 In each village there is a Methodist  
 Chapel which has its own activities   
 throughout the year. All the villages 
 come within the Church of England     
 Parish of Aysgarth and share the      
 activities of the Church.             </content>
