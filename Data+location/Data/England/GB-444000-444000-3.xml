		<content>      The Parish no longer has its own 
 exclusive vicar but shares services   
 with two neighbouring villages. Inside
 the church there is a splended tomb of
 a knight dated 1634.  Until recently  
 the Wesleyan Chapel, dated 1828       
 was used by the Methodists but it has 
 now been sold.                        
      The school and the church run    
 most of the local events such as wine 
 and cheese parties and coffee mornings
  _ whilst in Wighill Park, pony club  
 and caravan rallies are held.         
      Many of the inhabitants of       
 Wighill are older people and they like
 the peace and quiet of the village but
 there is not much for teenagers and   
 children to do. You need transport to 
 go anywhere and there are only two    
 local buses a day.
