		<content> A TYPICAL ADULTS DAY                  
 I get up at 7.3Oam and then I make the
 breakfast which is toast and cereal   
 for Julie and Joanne. They go to      
 school at 8.4Oam and then I have a cup
 of coffee, make the beds and wash the 
 dishes. I then do other jobs such as  
 washing clothes or vacuuming the      
 carpets. The girls come home for      
 dinner which is usually egg and chips.
 They go back to school at 12.45. I do 
 my shopping in Birtley but have to be 
 back for Joanne who is five at 3.15pm.
 Julie arrives home at four; o'clock   
 and we all have our tea. We usually   
 have salad sandwiches and a glass of  
 coke. I wash up and the girls go out  
 to play. They come in at 8pm and go to
 bed. I wash the dishes tidy up and    
 have a bath before going to bed at    
 9pm.
