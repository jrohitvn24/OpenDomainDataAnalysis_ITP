		<title>09EMPLOYMENT A NURSE</title>
		<content> My mother is a qualified nurse.She    
 nurses at the General Hospital in     
 Harrogate and at the momemt she is on 
 nights which means when I come home   
 from school I have to be quiet because
 I might wake her up.She also works a  
 day shift,but she says she likes      
 nights better than days,because she   
 earns more money on nights than day   
 work,She goes to work in a 10 year old
 Ford Escort.Her uniform is a white hat
 and white overall and she wears a     
 badge with her name on it.
