		<title>11ST.MARYS LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content> St. Mary the Virgin is the only Church
 of England church in Little Baddow,but
 there is a Methodist chapel and a     
 United Reformed church in the area.The
 major religion in Little Baddow is    
 Christianity.                         
   From the outside the church looks   
 like a castle with butresses and a    
 tower.The north west and south west   
 butresses are angled to support the   
 heavy tower,which is 52ft high and is 
 14th century in origin.               
   On the north wall there is evidence 
 that the church dates from Norman     
 times as the masonry is 11th and 12th 
 century.There are also Roman tiles    
 used in the construction,these were   
 found on the site and once formed part
 of a hypocaust system.                
   The south porch is interesting as it
 contains medieval timbers and a 300   
 year old lantern.                     </content>
