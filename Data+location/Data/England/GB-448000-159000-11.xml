		<title>11From a Cheam Boy:1985</title>
		<content>    Cheam is one of the oldest         
 preparatory schools in the country.It 
 started life in{Surrey in 1645}and    
 moved to{Headley in 1934.             
    This feepaying school has about 140
 boys and has very good facilities,    
 which include a big sports hall and   
 squash court,an up to date computer   
 room and a music school.              
    The main academic studies are      
 English,Maths,French,Science and      
 Latin.I rate Cheam as a very well     
 equipped school with all that you     
 would need for work and recreation.   
    There is a wide choice of things to
 do,ranging from almost any sport to   
{dibs and marbles.                     
    Cheam has a chain of monitors who  
 with the staff run the school and     
 organise the younger boys, achieving a
 high academic standard and fully      
 preparing pupils for Public School.   </content>
