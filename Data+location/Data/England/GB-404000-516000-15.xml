		<title>15LEISURE IN BARNARD CASTLE</title>
		<content> Built in 1854,the Witham  Hall in the 
 main street has become the town's     
 centre for social activites.Run as an 
 extension to the Y.M.C.A.it has       
 something to offer most people.       
 Children can take part in a variety of
 activities from chess to karate and   
 the Summer Adventure Play scheme has  
 proved very popular.Adults can choose 
 from cake icing,sewing,typing,aerobics
 ,dancing and yoga.Trips are arranged  
 to other places to remind us of       
 amenities we lack.Not that people in  
 Barnard Castle need reminding that we 
 have no public swimming pool.This is a
 point being debated between towns-folk
 at present.The majority agree that it 
 is something the town would benefit   
 from but can a town this size stand   
 the cost of building and running such 
 a venture,or will it still be a       
 debating point in 1990?               </content>
