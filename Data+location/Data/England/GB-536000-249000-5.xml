		<content> Barrington school in the 1950s was    
 very different from today. There are  
 two teachers. One class in the hall   
 and one where the library is now. The 
 headteacher lived in the school house 
 with her family. The school had no    
 central heating, heat came from a huge
 black coke burning stove, enclosed by 
 a large guard. The county library kept
 books in a hall cupboard for weekly   
 withdrawals. Lessons seemed much more 
 serious and every year we had a nature
 project studying a tree and a bird. A 
 certificate was awarded for the best. 
 There were no games only Physical     
 Training, no swimming as there was no 
 school pool. Playtimes were spent on  
 the playground as there was no playing
 field. There was no tapped water only 
 a pump, no flush toilets, only Elsan  
 ones in a hut behind a big hedge where
 the mobile classroom now stands.      </content>
