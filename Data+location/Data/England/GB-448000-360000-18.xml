		<title>18Computers in Schools.</title>
		<content>     Most schools now have at least one
 microcomputer. They have been         
 introduced gradually over the past    
 three or four years. Our school,      
 (Cumberlands Middle) has four BBC     
 Microcomputers each with disc drives  
 for storage. We have two colour       
 monitors and two green monochrome     
 monitors. We also have a BBC Buggy    
 which is a small robot device which   
 can be controlled by the computer and 
 an AMX Mouse which makes drawing      
 pictures on the screen very easy. The 
 schools computers tend to be used     
 mainly in Maths lessons but they are  
 also used in other subjects - such as 
 this survey.
