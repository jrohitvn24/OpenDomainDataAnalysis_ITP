 in the countryside. Most people think 
 bus fares are to much.Mrs. White said 
 buses should be Â£1.00 return. Mini    
 buses would be better.It would be     
 preferable if steps were lower for old
 people etc. People say that buses     
 should be more frequent.One trip to   
 Cambridge from Toft takes 24 mins. It 
 is said that buses should travel half 
 hourly. Most interviewees like double 
 deckers. A traffic survey showed that 
 in one hour there were 151 vehicles   
 coming to Toft from 4-5 pm and going
