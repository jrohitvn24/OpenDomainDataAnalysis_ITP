  The present village hall was built in
1975 replacing a wooden ex-army hut    
from the 1914-18 war.The old hut was   
owned by the Women's Institute which   
was formed in 1919 but,in later        
years,the hut became too expensive for 
the W.I. to maintain.A village         
committee was formed and fund raising  
began.The present Hall cost fifteen    
thousand pounds to build.The hall is a 
centre for village activities,from the 
Playgroup to the Over-Sixties          
club,and is also used regularly for    
many fund-raising groups.The size of   
the Hall and the sprung wooden floor   
make it attractive for dances and      
discos.Musical evenings,Antiques       
fairs, Whist Drives,and Bazaars all    
take place in the Village Hall.The     
village school uses the hall for school
meals and physical activities every day</content>
