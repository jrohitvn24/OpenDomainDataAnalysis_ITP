		<title>16ALLESLEY HALL cont.</title>
		<content> In 1938 Lord Iliffe gave the hall and 
 its grounds to Coventry Corporation   
 since when it has been used as a      
 convalescent home and an orthopaedic  
 hospital.                             
                                       
 The hall at present is used by the    
 Leisure Services Department and the   
 grounds are used as a public park and 
 an approach golf course. There is     
 great concern in the area at the      
 present time as the Council are known 
 to have plans to sell the hall and the
 residents of Allesley Park have       
 worries with regards to the ammenities
 which may be taken away from them and 
 the use to which the hall may now be  
 put.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
