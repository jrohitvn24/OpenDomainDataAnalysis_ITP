		<content> My dog is a German Pointer. When dad  
 goes shooting he goes barmy. At       
 night he sleeps downstairs in the     
 kitchen but when he was a puppy he    
 slept in a cage and used to howl.     
 He eats dog biscuits mixed with meat  
      My dad made a fishpond out       
 of a old swimming pool.We bought five 
 goldfish which grew and had babies,   
 and then dad got two golden orfs from 
 a garden centre. My mum feeds them on 
 fish food from a tub.When winter comes
 dad puts a old door and netting on the
 fishpond.The netting is for the fish  
 to breath.The door is to stop the     
 water turning into ice and killing the
 fish. The most important thing when   
 you go near the pond is not to jump   
 around and cause too many vibrations.
