		<content>      Farming in the Area              
  Most of the agriculture of this area 
 is arable farming, although there is  
 some permanent pasture around Wyberton
 where cows are kept and at Frampton   
 where sheep are grazed. Most of the   
 fields are large, have no hedges and  
 there are few trees about. The fields 
 are fenced or are bounded by drains,  
 known locally as dykes. The water from
 the fields drain into these dykes and 
 from them into bigger drains until it 
 is finally pumped out into the river  
 at one of the pumping stations. From  
 there it is caried away into the sea. 
 This is necessary because the land is 
 very low. It was once marsh or fen and
 if it was not properly drained it     
 would soon become flooded.
