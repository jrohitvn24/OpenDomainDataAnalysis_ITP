 On Thursday 20th June 1985 we went to 
 Winkhill Farm which is just over the  
 by-pass.We went up a drive and passed 
 some cows,we saw some big fish in the 
 moat,they were carp and golden        
 orfe.After we had seen the fish we    
 went to the geese.The females were    
 white with orange beaks and feet and  
 the males were brown and white.There  
 were lots of goslings which were      
 yellow and black.After that we saw the
 cattle and there were lots of         
 calves.Most of the cows were          
 Lincolnshire Reds and there was one   
 Charolais bull.We walked in the moat  
 which surrounded the mound where      
 Winkhill Manor used to be.At the      
 bottom of the field was a gravel pit,a
 stone axe head had been found there.  </content>
