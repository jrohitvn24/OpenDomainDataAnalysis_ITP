		<title>18HAIRDRESSING IN TIMSBURY</title>
		<content>    Yesterday,Claire and I (Laura)     
 visited a local unisex hairdressing   
 salon.It is on a busy road,and it     
 is run by two girls.We were pleased   
 with our results.                     
    Perms are the most popular         
 hair-style in 1985 because it suits a 
 lot of people.The hairdressers do not 
 have to do many punk hairstyles.We    
 are glad about this.They get a lot of 
 customers and make a good living.     
 Having another salon nearby isn't a   
 problem.They buy a lot of their       
 accessories from 'reps'who visit      
 weekly.The most popular hair- styles  
 of 1985 which Claire and I like are   
 permed hair and long hair.Short       
 hair-styles are very popular,but you  
 have to have the style which suits    
 you.
