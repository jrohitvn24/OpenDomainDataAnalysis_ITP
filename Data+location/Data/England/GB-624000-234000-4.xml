		<title>04Warehouses in Parker Avenue</title>
		<content>  Behind the Walton Container Terminal 
there are some new roads in which firms
connected with the dock have set up.   
Some are transport firms and some store
containers.                            
  In Parker Avenue there are some very 
large warehouses. Two of these are     
"bonded" warehouses in which goods     
which have not paid customs duty are   
stored.                                
  At least one very large warehouse has
been taken over as an intervention     
store for holding some of the "grain   
mountain" which the European Economic  
Community has built up. Farmers are    
paid for the grain they produce even   
if it is not needed.149,000 tonnes are 
stored in Felixstowe at the moment.    
Some grain grown in Trimley last year  
was taken straight into store. Many    
people would rather send food to the   
hungry elsewhere rather than keep it.  </content>
