 Brickmaking has flourished in Pluckley
 for a century and seems likely to     
 continue, using the plentiful reserves
 of local clay. Production of stock    
 bricks is the main enterprise but     
 craftsmen still practise hand throwing
 for special lines. The work force of  
 31 is a close knit community, often   
 following family traditions in the    
 trade.                                </content>
