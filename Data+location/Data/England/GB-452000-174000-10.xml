		<title>10Christmas Trees</title>
		<content>   Yattendon Estates grow an awful lot 
 of Christmas Trees.  Every year you   
 can see pictures of them on           
 television. They are dug up by a      
 special machine operated by a team of 
 men who come every year from the      
 island of Sark in the Channel Islands.
   Then they are fed into another      
 machine operated by some of our Mums  
 which puts a plastic tube over them to
 stop the branches from spreading.     
   They have to wear gloves to stop the
 needles from scratching their hands.  
  They start digging  in October.  Some
 of the trees are flown all over the   
 world to places like Arabia.          
  There have to be guards in the fields
 to stop people coming along with      
 lorries and poaching them.  The estate
 gives two trees to the school, a big  
 one for the Juniors and a small one   
 for the Infants.                      </content>
