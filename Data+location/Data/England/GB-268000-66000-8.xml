 Almost all the people whom we         
 interviewed own cars, and many said   
 that it would be impossible to live   
 in the area without your own means of 
 transport. There is a bus service to  
{Buckfastleigh,}on Wednesdays and      
 Fridays, which serves the villages of 
 Holne, Michelcombe and Scorriton, and 
 stops at Hawson Cross for the people  
 of Combe.                             
                                       
 The residents are very keen to support
 the bus service, which is run by a    
 private company in Buckfastleigh, and 
 for this reason some of them tend to  
 use the bus sometimes in preference to
 their own cars.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
