		<title>11Abandoned Railway Lines</title>
		<content>  The Barnard Castle-Kirkby Stephen    
 railway line,originally owned by the  
 Sth.Durham and Lancashire Union,was   
 opened in{July,1861,}for transporting 
 minerals.It was closed in{November,   
{1964,}and dismantled soon afterward.  
  The section which runs through this  
 area is divided between a cutting and 
 an embankment.There are also two spurs
 which used to serve the quarries.     
  The closure of the railway led to the
 loss of jobs,not only for those people
 employed on the railway,but also for  
 workers from the nearby quarries.In   
 addition,it closed a cross-Pennine    
 route which often stayed open during  
 the winter when the A66 trunk road    
 became impassable.                    
  Apart from the road bridge on the A67
 (Barnard Castle to Bowes) which spans 
 the cutting and an odd red-brick pump-
 house,there is now little left to see.</content>
