		<title>18COMPILERS OF THE REPORTS</title>
		<content> These reports were compiled by the    
 pupils of four schools :Somerset      
 Bridge Primary School, St Joseph's    
 Roman Catholic School, St Margaret's  
 Private School and St George's Junior 
 School.                               
 St Margaret's School has a long       
 tradition of excellence and it is sad 
 that this exercise will be the last to
 be completed by its pupils as the     
 school closes on the same day as this 
 report is completed.
