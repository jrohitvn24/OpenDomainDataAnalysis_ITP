		<title>18Folklore of N.E. Longmynd</title>
		<content>  Stories handed down from generation  
 to generation are of great interest to
 both local people and visitors alike. 
  In Leebotwood they tell of a White   
 Lady. During the Civil War, a local   
 gentlewoman lost both her husband and 
 son, and ever since she has walked the
 area, dressed in white, searching for 
 her loved ones.                       
  In 1760 all grazing rights in a local
 valley were forfeit because a man     
 found dead there had not been sent for
 burial.To this day the valley is known
 as 'Dead Man's Batch'.                
  In the great snowstorm of 1865 the   
 Rev. Carr was returning to Woolstaston
 from Ratlinghope Church.A fierce storm
 blew up, snow fell heavily and every- 
 where were deep snowdrifts. His       
 struggle for survival in such Arctic  
 conditions on the Longmynd has made   
 him famous in Shropshire.             </content>
