		<content>Our area has mainly arable and cattle  
farming.                               
A local cattle farm has 75 cattle and  
63 sheep. It has 100 acres some of     
which is rented out. The farm has a    
baler,mower,kedder,turner,a bale       
loader,harrow,rollers and a muck       
spreader.                              
Today there are many health regulations
that the farmer has carry out by law.  
The animals have to have tubercloses   
(once every other year) and brucellosis
(every year) injections.               
Diseases on the farm include new forest
disease(eye infection),ringworm,fly    
born disease, and others. Sheep are    
commonly effected by fowel foot and    
foot rot. Warble fly is also common. It
is a plague and has a strange life     
cycle. Its maggot eats its way through 
the sheeps insides. Lamb are treated in
the Autumn for most diseases.          </content>
