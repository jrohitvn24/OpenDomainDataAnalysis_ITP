		<title>05BURHAM - THE GAMEKEEPER</title>
		<content> His main task is to rear and care for 
 game pheasants and partridge. He feeds
 them twice daily on {feed rides }in   
 the woods with wheat, whole maize and 
 protein pellets until 16 weeks old,   
 then just wheat and maize. The birds  
 come to his whistle to be fed. Each   
 year 2000 birds are released onto the 
 estate but only 40% are shot. He wears
 natural colours and is easily         
 recognised by the wild life. Although 
 he organises shooting parties he is   
 concerned more about conservation of  
 all wild life and its environment,    
 which includes keeping the general    
 public off this private land. The job 
 has become his lifetimes work as he   
 began as a boy {beater }and is now    
 obviously enjoying caring for the land
 as the gamekeeper.
