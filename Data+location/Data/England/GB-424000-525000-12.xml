		<title>12THE DERELICT LAND</title>
		<content>    The area we are studying near to   
 our school is mostly wasteland. There 
 used to be a housing estate there but 
 there are only 6 houses left standing,
 three boarded up and three bought. The
 houses had been there for about twelve
 years. They were pulled down because  
 they had been built on marsh land     
 which had not been drained well enough
 and the damp rose up into the houses. 
 Also, they were purpose built in      
 bolted sections with flat roofs. When 
 it rained the water stayed on the     
 roofs and gradually the water soaked  
 into the houses and made them damp.   
 There used to be four streets there   
 and they were called Cheviot Place,   
 Pennine Walk, Cleveland Place and     
 Cumbrian Place. There used to be a    
 shop but it has closed down because   
 there's no one left to buy things.    
 It's now a Community Task Force Centre</content>
