 have{15 storeys}and are approx.{220   
{feet high.}They are built of concrete,
 house bricks and metal struts.Although
 they are only{seventeen years}old the 
{brick cladding}is being replaced at a 
 cost of{Â£1.5 million.}Each of the 3   
 blocks are serviced by 2 lifts.Most of
 the residents are from the{Blackburn} 
 area,and a large number of them have  
 lived in the 270 flats since they were
 built.The caretaker{Mr.Duxbury}has the
 responsibility of making sure that the
 building is{clean}and{safe.}There is a
 seperate caretaker for each block of  
 flats.Some{advantages}of living in the
 flats are that they are{compact}and   
 create less housework.A{disadvantage} 
 of living there is that there can be a
 lot of{noise}caused by the{younger    
{generation}who are also responsible   
 for{graffiti}on some of the walls.    </content>
