		<title>20NEWS STORY UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> The local paper in Hull is called 'The
 Daily Mail' and its main headline is  
 about youth unemployment.  The        
 headline is this, 'YOUNG JOBLESS HITS 
 AN ALL TIME RECORD'.  There are now   
 17,250 young people claiming benefits 
 as they have not got a job, and this  
 does not include the people who left  
 school in the summer because they     
 cannot claim benefit until September. 
 These figures are for the County of   
 Humberside but those for Hull alone do
 not make good reading, there are      
 9,186 young people unemployed.        
 As for total unemployment in the city,
 there are 23,491 people unemployed and
 claiming benefit, nearly 10% of the   
 population of Hull. Nationally there  
 are 3,235,036 people unemployed and   
 claiming benefit and this does not    
 include 134,455 school leavers.
