{Thornton First School, 1985.

 MONDAY. On Mondays my mum wakes me up 
 at 7.00 am. I read until 7.40, then I 
 get up. I have my breakfast and get   
 washed and dressed. I get my bag ready
 for school. I go to school, do all my 
 work, then go home for dinner at 12   
 noon. I go back to school in the      
 afternoon. After school I go to my    
 grandma's for a drink. Then I catch   
 the bus home. My mum meets me off the 
 bus and I cross over the road with    
 her. Then at 4.30 pm I go to piano    
 lessons. After that I have my tea. I  
 watch television and play out         
 sometimes in the field nearby and     
 sometimes on the lane. I have a bath, 
 watch television again and then go to 
 bed.
