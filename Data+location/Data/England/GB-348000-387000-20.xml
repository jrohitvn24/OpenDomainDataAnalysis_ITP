 limited. Most people we asked seemed  
 to provide their own recreational     
 activities.                           
{Spectator sports}People interested in 
 rugby or soccer travel to either      
 Widnes or Liverpool to watch matches. 
 The majority of people support sport  
 via their television, which is present
 in most homes.

 football teams. Badminton and keep fit
 are held in the village community     
 centre. Locally there are golf,tennis,
 cricket,rugby and swimming clubs. The 
 pubs provide snooker, darts and bowls.
