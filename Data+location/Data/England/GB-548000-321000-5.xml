		<title>05THE LIGHTHOUSE</title>
		<content> When the river was cut it was decided 
 to have two lighthouses  to guide the 
 ships into the mouth of the Nene.     
 Unfortunately, by the time that the   
 lighthouses were built,the mouth of   
 the river a mile out towards the sea  
 and the lighthouses were of no use.   
 The still remain as sentries to the   
 entrance of Sutton Bridge.Sir Peter   
 Scott spent so time living and working
 in one of them.                       
 The lighthouses were constructed of   
 home made bricks and built in 1857.
