		<title>11THE CHICKSANDS PRIORY</title>
		<content>{The Chicksands Priory}is one of two   
 manors which made up the Chicksands   
 estate,recorded in the Domesday Survey
 of 1086.In 1150, the Priorywas granted
 to the Gilbertine religious order. It 
 eventually became the third largest   
 monastery in the order, and one of    
 only nine religious houses in the     
 order to enclose both nuns and canons.
      The tale most often told about   
 the old building has to be that of the
 "fallen nun"named Rosata. She had a   
 friendship with one of the            
 canons,which blossomed to a love      
 affair, ending in pregnancy.As        
 punishment, the Prior, upon finding   
 out, sentenced her to be walled up    
 alive in the cloisters after          
 witnessing the execution of her lover.
 It is said that Rosata walks the      
 grounds of the Priory on the 17th of  
 every month in search of her lover.   </content>
