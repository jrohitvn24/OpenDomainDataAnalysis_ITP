		<content> Around this area children start school
 at the ages of four&amp;five.Then they    
 stay at a Primary school until the age
 of eleven.After Primary school there  
 are convents and Secondary schools    
 such as Upton Hall Convent,Marion     
 Bishop Challoner.They stay at those   
 schools until they are eighteen or    
 they can leave at the age of          
 sixteen.The sort of exams they can    
 take are O levels and CSE's they start
 to take these when they are fourteen  
 or fifteen.There are also Nursery     
 schools and play schools round the    
 area and you start these at the age of
 three. I go to St Josephs School in   
 Upton and it is a Primary School.....
