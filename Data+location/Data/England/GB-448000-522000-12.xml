		<title>12SALTHOLME FARM 2</title>
		<content> All the meat from the farm is sold    
 direct to the abbatoir rather than go 
 to auction.This is to provide the     
 manager with direct information as to 
 the quality of the meat and his       
 sudsequent alterations in feeding     
 needed to preserve the quality.       
  Togther with the cattle an increasing
 number of acres is given over to the  
 growing of{winter wheat}and{oil seed  
{rape,}which,as well as being a        
 cashcrop,is also excellent for        
 "clearing"the land instead of letting 
 it lie fallow in the rotation system. 
  The farm{employs}8 full time men and 
 2 seasonal workers.                   
  Pipe lines and pylons run across the 
 land resulting in a very industrial   
 and ugly outlook though the farm is   
 reasonably prosperous.
