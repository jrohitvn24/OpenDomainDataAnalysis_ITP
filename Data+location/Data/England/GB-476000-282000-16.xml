		<content>Desborough is a small town of some 6000
people situated on the main London road
The part covered by the survey is      
separated from the town centre by the  
A.6 road.Many old buildings have been  
demolished in recent years to make way 
for road improvements.One of the most  
important factors in Desborough's      
development has been the Co-operative  
movement which extended its influence  
into all aspects of life.At one time it
owned ironstone quarries and still     
makes corsets as well as operating     
retail shops.In the last 20 years there
has been considerable housing develop- 
ment towards Braybrooke.A new school   
was opened in 1974.Some industrial     
development has taken place on the     
fringes of our area.The football club  
caters for social and leisure          
activities.
