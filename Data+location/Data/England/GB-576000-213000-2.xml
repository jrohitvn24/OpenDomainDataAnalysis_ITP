		<title>02TERLING ARTS AND CRAFTS</title>
		<content> Although many of the old Arts and     
 Crafts have died out, there are still 
 some that flourish in the village.    
 Being a rural farming community, there
 used to be 2 or 3 blacksmiths, as well
 as wheelwrights. These no longer      
 exist, but one old Craft has been     
 revived by a retired man, who, as well
 as making beautiful corn-dollies      
 himself, instructs many others.       
 Another man instructs others in the   
 skill of weaving rush seats for       
 chairs. There is also a class which   
 teaches people how to paint on china. 
 This is now run by the ex-deputy head 
 of our school. Others in the village  
 practise a number of crafts e.g.      
 painting on eggs and stones, sewing   
 commemorative tapestries and spinning 
 and weaving. The standard of Art at   
 the School is high, as is the work    
 entered for the Annual Flower Show.   </content>
