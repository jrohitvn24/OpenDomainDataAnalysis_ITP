		<title>01Ewerby and Howell</title>
		<content> The land east of Howell is flat fen   
 with no public roads. The village of  
 Ewerby is expanding with a number of  
 medium &amp; large houses being built     
 1982/85. The residents of these &amp;     
 other houses work in agriculture or   
 travel to Sleaford &amp; other towns to   
 work. Children travel to Kirkby La    
 Thorpe or Sleaford schools. Ewerby has
 a thriving community organization with
 dances &amp; other events in the Reading  
 Room. The other hamlets &amp; isolated    
 houses are mainly occupied by farmers 
 or farmworkers. The crops are mainly  
 arable with sheep being used as a     
 break on some farms, foraging sugar   
 beet residues or forage crops. Ewerby 
 Church has a fine peal of 10 bells,   
 much visited at weekends by           
 bellringers from all over the country.
