		<title>09HAPPY VALLEY &amp; PETITION.</title>
		<content> Happy Valley is an area of unspoilt   
 natural beauty containing a large     
 variety of wildlife, situated in the  
 Bramhall area.  There are plans by    
 Stockport Council to surface pathways,
 erect picnic sites and the cutting    
 down of trees to make the pathways.   
 We, who are doing this petition,      
 believe that these proposed plans     
 would not only spoil the natural      
 beauty, but drive out the wildlife of 
 Happy Valley.  This petition is an    
 attempt to try to stop Stockport      
 Council's plans for Happy Valley.     
 Up to this present date we have spent 
 about four hours doing this petition  
 and have amassed a total of two       
 hundred and twenty signatures. We have
 found that the local response has been
 overwhelming, only ten people have    
 refused to sign.                      
                                       </content>
