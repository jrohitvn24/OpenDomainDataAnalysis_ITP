		<title>03ATTITUDES IN E. CORNWALL.</title>
		<content> This is a sedate,inward looking people
 basically conservative in outlook.The 
 adjuncts of modern life had brought a 
 slow change of attitudes, but arrivals
 of newcomers since 1975 has speeded   
 the process.Friendliness towards these
 newvomers has cooled as numbers       
 increased,house prices rose,and their 
 more sophisticated views rub of on    
 local youth. Original indifference to 
 many National problems has changed as 
 parents realise the area's new        
 vulnerability. Talks are given on drug
 abuse,and unaccustomed choices made in
 education to combat unemployment.     
 Felings of hostility by farmers to the
 Common Market are evident as produce  
 mountains grow and profits fall.At a  
 time when Britain is not self         
 sufficient in milk,there is anger at  
 milk Quotas which thwart aspirations.
