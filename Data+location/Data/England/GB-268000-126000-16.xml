		<title>16My House (4)</title>
		<content>  I live in a detached bungalow which  
 is owner occupied. It is made of      
 brick. We have 3 bedrooms, 1 sitting  
 room, 1 dining room ,1 bath room and  
 1 kitchen. We have 1 garage. We have a
 big garden . In the back of our garden
 we used to have a vegetable garden but
 then we planted grass to make a lawn. 
 In our garden we have a patio. On the 
 patio we have got a brick barbecue    
 which my daddy made. Behind our garden
 there is a field but it does not      
 belong to us. It belongs to the       
 farmer. Our garage has got a flat     
 roof. In our garden we have a big     
 willow tree.
