		<content>   The lack of free stone in the area  
 has meant that the older houses are   
 timber framed. In the oldest examples 
 split oak logs were used, but by      
 Victorian times thinner sawn timber   
 was common. The spaces between the    
 timbers are filled with wattle and    
 daub, or brick nogging. The coming of 
 railways and tarred roads saw the     
 greater use of brick,brought from     
 Peterborough area.                    
    Today the Elizabethan brick houses 
 (few) and timber framed houses form   
 attracions for tourists.              
    In the area there are no large     
 modern housing estates, but there has 
 been"infill"with high cost architect  
 designed properties.                  
    Arkesden has many old houses       
 surviving, making it a very pleasant  
 but expensive village.
