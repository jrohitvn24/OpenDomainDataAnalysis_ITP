		<content>   We took a{count}of the vehicles     
 passing along the A449 Worcester      
 to Kidderminster road and the         
 A4133 Ombersley to Droitwich road on  
 21.5.85 between 10.15a.m. and         
 10.25a.m.. On the A449 144 vehicles   
 passed, on the A4133 35 passed.       
                                       
   We went outside to collect car      
 numbers so that we could tell the{age 
 they were by looking at the last      
 letter which shows the year they were 
 registered. The average age of 50 cars
 turned out to be 5.1 years.           
                                       
   We counted the different{sorts of   
{vehicles}and found that the A443      
 carried 49 cars, 10 lorries and 16    
 vans in 15 minutes. There was one     
 pedestrian.All the vehicles were      
 diesel or petrol engined. No buses,   
 bikes or tractors passed in this time.</content>
