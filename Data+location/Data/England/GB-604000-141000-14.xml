		<content> In 1985 the pupils have raised #300   
for the Ethiopian Famine Relief.Even   
the infants join in with charity work  
and on Sports Day they take part.They  
also do a Christmas nativity play each 
year whilst the juniors act out the    
history of Brook,in the church. Brook  
School is set in beautiful sur-        
roundings in the countryside.Itis      
situated just outside the village of   
Brook and there are trees and fields   
around it.The pupils have a nature     
garden where there are ponds and small 
insects and animals which both infants 
and juniors help to look after. The    
pupils of Brook School get on well     
with each other and also with their    
teachers.They all enjoy their lessons  
very much. Although it is a small      
school   they   have a computer which  
the juniors use once a week.
