		<title>05SHEFFORD ANNUAL FAIR</title>
		<content> In 1312 a Royal Charter granted to    
 Shefford the right to hold an annual  
 fair.This was held at Michaelmas each 
 year but in recent years has been held
 as a street fair on the eleventh of   
 October.                              
      At the fair are lots of          
 rides.There is a waltzer which is a   
 round board with lots of round seats  
 on it.When it goes round the seats    
 twirl around as well.There is a mini  
 wheel and a ride called a Mexican hat 
 which goes round with one side up and 
 one side down.                        
     There are lots of stalls that sell
 candy floss,pop-corn,balloons and     
 sweets.There are stalls to play games 
 on such as darts and throwing the     
 hoops.                                
     If the fair does not come one year
 it cannot come again.
