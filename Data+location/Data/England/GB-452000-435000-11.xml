		<title>11People - general</title>
		<content> The people of this area fall in to two
 general categories. Thefamilies who   
 have lived here for many years some   
 working on the land others retired,   
 and those who work outside the area   
 but have chosen country life to that  
 of the suburbs of Leeds. The          
 inhabitants like living in this area  
 it is quiet, apart from aircraft noise
 from the R.A.F. which is tolerated but
 is often a topic of conversation      
 especially after a period of night    
 flying. No one interviewed wished to  
 live in a town, but agreed it is a    
 quiet way of life which at times      
 becomes rather boring.
