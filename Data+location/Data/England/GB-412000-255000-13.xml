		<title>13CHURCHES, CHAPEL IN HASELOR</title>
		<content> The parish church of Haselor has not  
 changed very much over the last 25    
 years.This year the choir had their   
 own cassocks. The paths leading up to 
 the church have been resurfaced so it 
 is easier to walk up to church in the 
 dark. The church (All Saints,C.E.) at 
 Billesley is open for services twice a
 year. If you want to visit it you     
 should see the Vicar of Wilmcote or   
 ask at Billesley Manor Hotel. Haselor 
 church shares a vicar with Great Alne 
 and Kinwarton churches. The Baptist   
 Chapel by the crossroads in Haselor   
 was converted to a house a few years  
 ago. There are three floors in it,the 
 bottom floor still has the old font in
 it and there are candlestick holders  
 everywhere. In one bedroom there is a 
 built-in wardrobe and with a picture  
 painted inside.The stones with dates  
 and names on are still in the walls.  </content>
