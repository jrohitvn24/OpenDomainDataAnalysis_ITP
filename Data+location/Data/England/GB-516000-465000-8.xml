		<title>08Typical day in Bridlington,1</title>
		<content> It's Tuesday;I get up at 7:30 for     
 school. I set off for school at 8:25  
 with my mate Lynn. We walk across the 
 road and wait for  our other friend   
 called Kerry who lives at Burton      
 Fleming and has to come by bus. Our   
 lessons start at 9:20, first we have a
 double lesson of cooking then we have 
 a double lesson of biology. Then I go 
 home for my dinner and arrive back at 
 school at 12:50. My lessons in the    
 afternoon are French with Miss        
 Metcalfe, Maths with Mr Lewis and     
 English with Mr Bradshaw. We go home  
 at 3:30 and at 4:30 I set off on my   
 bike for work. I work at the Pembroke 
 Hotel and as soon as I arrive I fill  
 all the water jugs and put them on the
 tables. Then I go round with the bread
 -buns and fruit juice. I bang the gong
 serve the soup, then the first course,
 then the sweet and the coffee.(Cont)  </content>
