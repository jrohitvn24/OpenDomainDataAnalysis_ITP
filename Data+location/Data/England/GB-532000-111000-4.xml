 CHURCH                                
 Westmeston Church was built in the    
 12th century,and extensions were built
 up to 1880.                           
 The church looks old and is made of   
 flint,stone and wood.It is decorated  
 with stained glass windows.           
 The church holds annual money raising 
 functions,eg:fetes,flower shows,to    
 help repair and maintain the church.  
 Although only 1 in 5 of the villagers 
 go to church regularly everyone       
 attends on Christmas Day.             
 Westmeston village is very small. The 
 villagers are mainly retired. Those   
 who work have to travel out of the    
 district.There is no emergency        
 services,There are no shops.there are 
 no main drains.They have              
 Tudor,Victorian and Modern houses.    
 There are more horses than people.    </content>
