		<content>  Mr. X lives in a stone cottage in    
 Stony Houghton.He lives with his wife 
 and daughter.He enjoys living in Stony
 Houghton but it can get lonely.He said
 there was no vandalism but during the 
 1984 miners Strike, the local farmers 
 suffered from sheep rustling.His      
 leisure hours are spent gardening and 
 looking after his goat.His garden is  
 very large.The cottage was small but  
 nice.There was a gas fire,a           
 television,two settees,a rocking      
 chair,three bookshelves and a small   
 table,under which slept his dog.The   
 kitchen was tiny.
