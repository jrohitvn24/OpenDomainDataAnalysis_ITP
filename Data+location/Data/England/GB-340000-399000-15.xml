		<title>15Kirkby in World War 2</title>
		<content> There are some pupils in our school   
 whose grandparents have lived in      
 Kirkby for a very long time. Some     
 lived or worked here during World War 
 Two (1939-45). They describe how there
 were very few shops or buses in the   
 town then an even how they were few   
 lights and pavements.                 
     During the war, the timber yard in
 our block was taken over by the       
 American Inland Sorting Depot. Also to
 help the war effort there were weapons
 made on what is now the industrial    
 estate. They were made in ordinance   
 factories.It was mainly women who     
 worked there because so many men were 
 away at war. So even a small place    
 like Kirkby, as it was then, had an   
 important part to play in the war.
