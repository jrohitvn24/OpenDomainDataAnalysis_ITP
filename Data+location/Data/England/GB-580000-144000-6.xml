		<content>{The A274 Maidstone to Tenterden road  
 runs N-W to S-E across the region and 
 is unusually straight in this Wealden 
 area. Part of the road was built by   
 Napoleonic prisoners during the early 
 part of the 19th. century. This is a  
 through route for heavy lorries and   
 cars and being only 10 miles from the 
 County Town many villagers travel     
 along it for general shopping or to   
 work. Buses provide an hourly service 
 to Maidstone and back (Â£1.10 single   
 adult fare).{Various narrow lanes     
 criss-cross the region. Many of them  
 have their origins in cart tracks or  
 drovers' roads of the early Middle    
 Ages.{The Charing Cross to Ashford    
{railway line}runs W.to E. along the   
 southern fringe of the village and    
 provides a very fast and frequent     
 commuter service to and from the city.
 Trains come every 20 minutes sometimes</content>
