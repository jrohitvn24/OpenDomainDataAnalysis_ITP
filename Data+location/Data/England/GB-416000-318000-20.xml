The Thomas Russell Junior School held  
a Victorian school assembly as part of 
the centenary celebrations of the      
Thomas Russell School (now the Infant  
School).It was so different to the     
normal school assemblies because the   
teachers were very strict and always   
had stern tone in their voices.The     
teachers all had mats by their chairs  
and we soon found out what they were   
for.Instead of having a story we had   
read to us a very long prayer during   
which we had to kneel on the hard      
floor with our backs straight.The      
teachers of course had mats on which   
to kneel.After assembly we had a       
handkerchief  inspection.Surprisingly  
most children did not have one!We all  
had to answer teachers using the word  
"Sir" or "Ma'am".
