 2.The walk can be shortened by driving
 the car and parking it near the Allen 
 Mill bridge over the{Thornley         
{Gate/Catton}road.Starting out at this 
 point,the walking distance will be    
 reduced to about 4.5 miles.           
  On reaching the{B6295}road,turn      
 right,cross the stone{Allen Mill}     
 bridge and in a few metres you will   
 see a signpost on your right marked{  
{"To Oakpool".}Follow this footpath and
 descend with the river on your right  
 , bearing left by the waymark on      
 the tree and walk up to a             
 wicket-gate.As you pass through the   
 gate,you will enter a wild and        
 beautiful stretch of country which    
 must have changed little in the past  
 century. It is full of                
 birdlife-swallows,heron,and moor-hens.</content>
