		<title>19Tree survey of Crockenhil.</title>
		<content> In 1982,8 villages identified,measured
 and mapped every tree,hedge, and wood 
 within a two mile radius of the       
 village.In 1983 200 copies of a Report
 were printed with a grant from the    
 Wild Flower society.Many have been    
 sold far beyond the boundaries of     
 Kent.We found that within the village 
 were many fine Victorian and Edwardian
 trees and beyond ancient pollards and 
 hedges were relic wood boundaries     
 which were left after the woods them  
 selves had grubbed up .               
 There are many threats to trees here. 
 Few woods remain and they are         
 neglected.Many hedges have been       
 grubbed up or are being damaged by    
 farming operations.Planning           
 applications or the individual        
 vagaries of housesholders threaten    
 other trees.In 1983 Crockenhill won   
 the Kent"Trees in Your village comp." </content>
