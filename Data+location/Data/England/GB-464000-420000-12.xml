		<title>12SNAITH PLAY AREA</title>
		<content> The Snaith play area was opened in    
 1983 by the Mayor of Snaith, Mr K     
 Dean. It was provided by the Town     
 Council and is jointly owned by the   
 Town and the Primary School. There are
 two sets of play equipment; a large   
 slide and set of swings for older     
 children and swings, slide,playframe  
 and sandpit for the younger children. 
 The Council are considering building a
 playmound on the area. They hope to   
 transfer the hill from the school     
 field onto the play area. If they are 
 successful the school will be able to 
 have a proper football pitch for the  
 first time in ten years.
