		<content>    Lee-on-the-Solent is essentially a 
 twentieth century development dating  
 from late Victorian times.It is a     
 small,quiet mostly residential and un-
 commercialised seaside resort with    
 commanding views of the{Solent}and the
{Isle of Wight}.Despite the            
 construction of the railway,pier and  
 tower - all now no longer in existence
 - Lee did not live up to the          
 expectations of its original planners.
 Now mainly a dormitory for Gosport,   
 Fareham and Portsmouth,an increasing  
 number of its residents are retired   
 people.                               
    Lee-on-the-Solent is well served by
 local shops and services.These tend to
 be more traditional in style and goods
 are generally higher priced.Tourists  
 tend to be day visitors from other    
 local towns as facilities for the long
 stay tourist are under-developed.     </content>
