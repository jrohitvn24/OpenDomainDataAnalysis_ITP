 The{trout}feeds mainly on flies,      
 particularly the{Mayfly}which breeds  
 in the mud of the river.Some eggs are 
 taken to stretches of the river where 
 Mayflies are known to be less         
 numerous.Fishermen pay the owner to   
 fish.Costs vary according to the      
 location.To fish in our D.Block this  
 year from 1st May to 1st Oct would    
 cost Â£1100 + 15% V.A.T.This is for 1  
 day a week and the fisherman may take 
 no more than 4 trout.The heaviest     
 brown trout caught in the D.Block was 
 thought to be 8 &amp; a half lbs. Regular 
 fishermen apply to the landowner for  
 permission.Casual visitors to the area
 apply through an agency in Winchester.
 Tourists, mainly Americans,           
 frequently take the opportunity to    
 fish for trout in the {River Test}.   </content>
