		<content> Yaxham's home ground is Jubilee       
 Park.They play against other clubs    
 like Mattishall,Garvestone and East   
 Tuddenham.The park was opened in 1980 
 by Katie Glass,and now most people in 
 the village know it very well.Next to 
 the park is the village hall,which    
 they use for changing in.Yaxham play  
 on Saturdays and the boys sometimes   
 play on Sunday mornings;the men play  
 again in the afternoon.There is a     
 first team and a reserve team for     
 those who are'nt good enough for the  
 first team.One of the players'wives   
 prepares the oranges,and the coach    
 deals with any who are hurt.For many  
 years there was only one side and they
 always played away because they did'nt
 have a ground.Later they played near  
 the station.When Jubilee Park was     
 built the mens'team re-formed and also
 the  U13 and U15 teams were formed.   </content>
