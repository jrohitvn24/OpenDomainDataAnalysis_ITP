		<content> Workington was once a prosperous town 
 with a coal mining industry, iron and 
 steel works and a busy dock system.   
 During the late 60s and mid 70s the   
 town experienced the{closures}of its  
 pits, a loss of its iron and steel    
 making plant and a reduction of the   
 necessary support services for these  
 industries.                           
 As an{Enterprise Zone,}respective     
 governments have encouraged small     
 industries to develop in the 'lego'   
 type buildings which have mushroomed  
 on the towns{industrial estates.}Some 
 of these industries have become       
 established, others like Courtalds    
 have vanished throwing many people    
 once more onto the dole.              
 Nearly 20% of the work force is       
{unemployed}and there is great fear    
 that this figure will increase as the 
 economic situation deteriorates.      </content>
