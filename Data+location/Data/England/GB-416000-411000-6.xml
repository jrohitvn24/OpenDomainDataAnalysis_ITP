		<title>06THE CORNER SHOP</title>
		<content> Mr Sandford was made redundant and    
 decided to buy a corner shop and work 
 for himself.Shop keeping wasn't       
 in the family but his Aunty and Uncle 
 owned a small shop.Mr Sandford has to 
 get up at 5.30 a.m to prepare the shop
 for a day's work.It takes about 1 hour
 to clean up the shop but on Saturdays 
 it takes 2 hours.He re-stocks mainly  
 on Wednesdays.Cigarettes are sold most
 since he started. He dislikes         
 computers and will not sell expensive 
 goods.Mrs Sandford gets mad when the  
 floor gets dirty every night.Children 
 come in the shop mainly but most old  
 people think it is more convenient    
 than a big super market.Mrs Sandford  
 likes fancy goods and makes a lot of  
 money out of them.Unknown items will  
 never sell.The shop is roughly 11ft by
 18ft.Mr Sandford said shop keeping    
 had improved over the years for him.  </content>
