		<title>08Ombersley Church</title>
		<content>  The church is{155 years old.}Canon   
 Doyle,the rector, can fit 300 people  
 downstairs and 300 people in the      
{galleries.}There are six bells in the 
 bell tower.Some of the bells go back  
 to the{sixteen hundreds}because they  
 hung in the old church,which was      
 beginning to fall down.The only part  
 of the old church that is left is the 
{old chancel}which is a separate       
 building sometimes used for small     
 services.Lots of people use the church
 in the week like bellringers,         
 embroiderers and flower arrangers, but
 unless there is someone to supervise, 
 the church is kept locked in case of  
 vandals.Canon Doyle is rector of      
 Ombersley and Doverdale parishes.He   
 has been a clergyman for 32 years.He  
 has a seat in the Cathedral in        
 Worcester,it is number 27.He and his  
 wife live in the beautiful rectory.   </content>
