 On a Wednesday night I go dancing from
 7.30pm.until 8.30pm. I go to the Alfa 
 Club to do ballroom, disco and        
 team-work.                            
 The dancers are aged between seven and
 fifteen years.                        
 We have two classes and we have just  
 done a test for gold bar two. For the 
 test we did a solo of our own chosing 
 and then two 'routine' dances; the    
 'New One'and  the 'Boogie' followed by
 'Flapjack'.                           
 Some of the first class did their test
 but they are on a lower level than us.
 The team also danced a routine        
 for their test.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
