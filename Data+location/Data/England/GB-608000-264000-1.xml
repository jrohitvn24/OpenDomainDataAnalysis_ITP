		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO MENDLESHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
Mendlesham is very old.  It is a       
village in the country with about 1200 
people and it is in the county of      
Suffolk.  The houses are made of bricks
but the old houses are made of clay    
and mud with timber frames.  We have   
a few big buildings. We have a church, 
a health centre with three doctors, a  
road haulage firm and a maltings that  
has recently closed down. It is now    
used for storing barley.  We also have 
a primary school and a bus and coach   
station called Galloways and seven     
shops. When the children go to the     
middle school and high school they go  
on the bus or coach.
