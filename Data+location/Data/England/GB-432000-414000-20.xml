		<content>   We were surprised how much country- 
 side there was around our city.       
 Newmillerdam is visited by many people
 from outside the area and we hope it  
 stays the same for many years to come.
  Perhaps more houses will be built and
 gradually the open countryside will   
 disappear.                            
  We would like to thank all those who 
 have helped us to find out what the   
 area is like in l985, especially the  
 Warden at Newmillerdam Country Park,  
 Mr.Gordon Lunn.                       
  The people of the area who have      
 helped the second years who have      
 gathered information, but especially  
 Form 2A for the interpretation of the 
 information and preparation of this   
 finished product.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
