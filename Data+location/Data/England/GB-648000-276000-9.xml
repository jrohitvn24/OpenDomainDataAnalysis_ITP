		<title>09CHURCH AND RELIGION.</title>
		<content> The churches in the area are: 2       
 established,1 Roman Catholic,1 United 
 Reformed and 1 Methodist.             
  There still exists a fairly deep     
 conservative Protestantism among the  
 indigenous population.This religious  
 attitude is for the most part not     
 articulated and can be traced back to 
 Cromwell's time.Suffolk was one of the
 recruiting grounds for his army,and   
 many churches still bear the marks of 
 his reforming zeal.                   
  With the influx of large numbers     
 of people retiring to this area or    
 buying properties for holiday homes,  
 this attitude is balanced by the      
 attitudes of the mostly "urban"       
 churches from which they come."Church"
 provides a basis of security and      
 strength.Most Church attenders are    
 elderly and resist changes in patterns
 of worship.                           </content>
