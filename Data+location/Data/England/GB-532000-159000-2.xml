		<content>       The person we interviewed was 94
 years of age.We asked her 10 questions
 and she gave us some very interesting 
 answers.We asked her about the fashion
 in those days and they wore dresses   
 down to their ankles,black stockings  
 and black shoes. The land cover in    
 Kenley has not changed a lot but      
 there were more fields and only a few 
 houses.They did not have electric     
 trains as they were all steam.There   
 were no cars only horse and carriages 
 and rich people usually had a very    
 nice one.                             
   One woman lived in a caravan for the
 first few years of her life and then  
 she moved into a cottage.             
  We interviewed some old people on    
 fashion.One old lady said before the  
 Charleston short dresses were thought 
 to be very unladylike , but not       
 when the Charleston became popular.   </content>
