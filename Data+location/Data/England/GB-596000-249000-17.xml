		<content>One mother played 'Scrabble' with a    
group of children and one played a     
matching dice game. Some children      
played with Lego bricks, while others  
played in the Wendy House. Some painted
and some made models from old cardboard
boxes. One group chalked on the black- 
board.                                 
After school I collected my weekly     
order from Stapel's Grocery Shop and at
4.30 fetched my husband from work. We  
had chicken for tea with new potatoes  
from the garden and peas, followed by  
ice cream and strawberries from the    
garden.My evening was spent finalising 
the arrangements for parking cars at   
Chelsworth Open Gardens Day.           
Soon after 10.00pm I crawled into bed! 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
