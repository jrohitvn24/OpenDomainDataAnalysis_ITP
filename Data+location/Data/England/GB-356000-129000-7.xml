   School and church work very closely 
 together and parents come in to help  
 with sewing and weekly swimming       
 outings to Strode Pool in nearby      
 Street.Parents also do odd jobs around
 the school.                           
   Schooling began in West Lydford in  
 1731 when Â£7 was left by Thomas Pope  
 for the education of six poor         
 children.In 1870 a school house was   
 made from a cottage next to the church
 but in 1874 the present school was    
 built.                                </content>
