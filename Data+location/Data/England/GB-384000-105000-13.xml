		<content>   AUDIENCES: the price of each event  
 depends on the artist's fame. Tickets 
 cost Â£2-Â£5. Performers enjoy coming to
 the BAC &amp; find responsive audiences.  
 It is common for companies to return. 
   The Manager felt that events would  
 be more supported if the BAC were in  
 the town. There are few young members.
 Drama produces an audience, mime shows
 are popular, music less so especially 
 if classical. Support from the school 
 has also declined; the cause is said  
 to be video/television habits.        
   Since opening in 1966 tastes have   
 changed: theatre "classics" are no    
 longer a draw and only "commercial"   
 shows guarantee audiences to fill the 
 542 seats. The Manager felt that in   
 future perhaps only three or four     
 major events a year might be staged   
 instead of the present fortnightly    
 events &amp; the four day July festival.  </content>
