		<title>19A Typical day in Manuden 2</title>
		<content> Mums are at home doing the house work.
 The children are now going to         
 assembly.Between ten and eleven the   
 children are outside in the play      
 ground. Some mums are having a cup of 
 tea or coffee. Between eleven and     
 twelve mums are getting the lunch     
 ready. In the classroom the children  
 are working. At twelve o'clock most   
 people are having lunch. After lunch  
 some of the children are at choir and 
 others are playing out side on the    
 field. At one o'clock some girls are  
 playing recorders. I could hear them  
 and it sounded nice. The children that
 weren't playing the recorders were    
 still outside playing and making a lot
 of noise. At quarter past one the     
 children are lining up to go inside . 
 Some mums are going shopping.         
                                       
                                       </content>
