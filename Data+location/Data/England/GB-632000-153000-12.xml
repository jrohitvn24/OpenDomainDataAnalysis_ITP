 There are no Doctors' or Dentists'    
 practices here but there are both in  
 Deal and Sandwich. Doctors will make  
 house calls but patients are mostly   
 seen by appointment at the surgeries. 
 There is a full medical centre at the 
 Colliery which helps those nearby. A  
 District Nurse comes from Deal when   
 needed. Hospitals are at Canterbury   
 and Deal. The W.V.S. Meals-on-Wheels  
 takes mid-day meals to those in need  
 of the service and Home-Helps are     
 available when necessary.             
{Transport.                            
 Buses run each way along the A258     
 every two hours but services start    
 late and finish early. There are no   
 Sunday services. 80% of residents have
 cars and many ride bicycles, mopeds   
 and motorbikes but it is difficult for
 those without their own transport.    </content>
