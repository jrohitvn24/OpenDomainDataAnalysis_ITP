		<title>16COMMONERS OF PILLEY/BOLDRE</title>
		<content>       There are about 15 practising   
 Commoners in the block who run from   
 1-10 ponies each,about 120 in all.    
 There's no money in it,it's a way of  
 life really,said the local coal       
 merchant who runs both ponies and     
 cattle on the forest.It is the link   
 with the land and an older life style 
 that makes him a practising commoner. 
 My parents ran ponies and when my sons
 were born we gave them a foal each to 
 get them started.They are buying and  
 breeding their own now.Mind you,its   
 slowly getting to be a better breed,  
 controls are tighter and standards    
 higher. The conservationists don't    
 always understand.When they put the   
 grids in and kept the animals from the
 villages it changed things.There is   
 good early grazing in the verges and  
 shelter along the hedgerows that they 
 can't reach now,it made them hardier. </content>
