		<title>06FARMING IN HEMEL HEMPSTEAD</title>
		<content>    The first{farmers}in Hemel         
 Hempstead were Saxons who settled in  
 the area in the 8th century. They     
 chose Gadebridge because of the{water 
{supply}(the River Gade). St.Agnells   
 Farm and Woodhall Farm have now been  
 built on, but the following{farms     
 still function in or near the         
 area:- Eastbrook Hay, Lovetts End,    
 Woodend and Wood Farm.                
    The{land}consists of approx. 30cm  
 topsoil, 2m clay and flint and at     
 least 70m chalk.{Crops}grown include  
 wheat, rape, kale, barley, beans, hay 
 and lucerne. Potatoes are not grown as
 the ground is too stony. A few farm   
 animals are also kept.{               
{   Drainage}in the area is good and   
 flooding is rare. Eastbrook Hay Farm  
 has its own underground water tanks   
 holding 40 or 50 thousand litres.
