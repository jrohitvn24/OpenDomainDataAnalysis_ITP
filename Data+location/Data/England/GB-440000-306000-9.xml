		<title>09NAILSTONE COLLIERY - TODAY</title>
		<content> Nailstone Colliery is owned by the    
{National Coal Board}and is situated   
 about one mile from the village. The  
 coal is used in Power Stations and is 
 transported by{overland conveyor}to a 
 large loading hopper in Bagworth, one 
 mile away. The coal required needs to 
 be from 0-25mm in diameter for        
 powdering into a fine dust that will  
 be blown into blast furnaces. During  
 the miners' strike in 1984-5, 850     
 lorries were needed to transport      
 80,000 tons of coal each week from    
 Nailstone. Usually a 1,000 ton train  
 can be loaded in 20 minutes. Today    
 jobs at the colliery vary from fitters
 and electricians to coal suppliers.   
 Today's mine employs the latest video 
 technology. The mines in this area    
 have a limited life and it is likely  
 that miners will have to find future  
 employment in the{Vale of Belvoir.    </content>
