		<content>   There is only one bit of main road  
 in our block, a few metres of the A52 
 from Boston to Skegness.              
   There is a Lincolnshire Road Car bus
 service from Boston to Skegness, which
 passes through Freiston and           
 Butterwick. Occasionally British Rail 
 runs the buses because the trains to  
 Skegness start and end late at night  
 and early in the morning.             
   The railway is outside our block.   
 The 5 Bells in Butterwick was         
 originally built as a station but the 
 railway never arrived.                
   There is a private bus service      
 running once a day from Fishtoft to   
 Boston by Hogg International Coaches. 
   Buses also run to the Secondary     
 Schools and Butterwick Primary School.
   All minor roads going East-West have
 to head for the bridges across the Hob
 Hole Drain, which crosses our block.  </content>
