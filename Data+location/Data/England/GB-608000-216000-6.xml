		<content> Brightlingsea Creek runs from{The     
{Hard,}along past the new wharf,beside 
 the oyster pits down to St. Osyth.Many
 locally built boats are launched from 
 The Hard including Catarmarans built  
 by Olympic Gold Medalist,{Reg White.  
 Hundreds of small pleasure craft are  
 moored alongside Cindery Island as    
 well as ,still, a few small fishing   
 trawlers.{The New Wharf}has been very 
 busy of late with many 150 ft. ships  
 unloading coal. It is very unpopular  
 locally because of all the lorry      
 traffic using the local roads.        
{The Oyster Pits}are very old and      
{E.P.Dicken's}book on The History of   
 Brightlingsea states that they were   
 established by 1200 A.D. and a major  
 local industry.Since 1930 the pits    
 have fallen into decay and now form an
 interesting biological feature as the 
 sea steadily reclaims the land.       </content>
