		<title>10COLN VALLEY FISH &amp; GAME CO.</title>
		<content> This firm has been in existence for   
 about 10 years and is owned by a local
 farmer. Its main complex is the Corner
 Barn in Winson and adjacent farm      
 buildings. It provides employment for 
 15 people with additional casual work 
 at the busiest times. Its main object 
 is the processing and storage of local
 produce such as pheasants and venison,
 and in addition special foods such as 
 salmon which is sent down from        
 Scotland. Other products are also kept
 under refrigeration, mainly to        
 increase the range. Fish and game     
 comprise two thirds of the business,  
 but the smokery, in a local stone kiln
 where dried sawdust is used, is       
 becoming increasingly important. The  
 main outlet for this specialised      
 produce is hotels, some local and     
 others within a 50 mile radius.
