		<title>13SHELTON &amp; OXON CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The church is called Christ Church. It
 was built in the year 1854. It was    
 built on an area of land known as     
 Windmill Field. The church was built  
 firstly, because the local population 
 had increased and secondly, the       
 parishoners had previously walked to  
 St. Chad's which was a long distance  
 away.                                 
 The church was built in the Early     
 English style. The stone came locally 
 from Cardeston. The dressing stones   
 also came locally, from Grinshill. It 
 was built to seat 250 people and      
 served the 3 townships of Shelton and 
 Oxon, Crowmeole, and Woodcote and     
 Morton.  The church was consecrated on
 October 3rd, 1854. The word Shelton   
 comes from the word "scelf", meaning  
 shelf or sloping ground and "ton", a  
 farm or enclosure. Therefore Shelton  
 means farm for Oxon, or "Ox Hill".    </content>
