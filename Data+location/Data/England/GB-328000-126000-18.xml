		<title>18A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  I usually wake up at 7 o'clock,dress 
 and go downstairs for breakfast.After 
 two pieces of toast and a cup of tea I
 wash and get ready for school.My      
 sister and I call for Kerry and we    
 walk for fifteen minutes to school.   
  We wait outside the classroom,chatt_ 
 ing to our friends until we are told  
 to go in at 9 o'clock.First the       
 register is taken and people choose   
 their lunch.I take sandwiches for     
 lunch.Then it is over to the hall for 
 assembly.I play my recorder.We have   
 two lessons in the morning and a      
 playtime for 15 minutes.Lunch is from 
 noon until 1.15pm.Two more hours of   
 school and then home.                 
  At home we have drinks and play until
 5.30pm when we have tea.Then I        
 practise my recorder for 30 minutes.I 
 play until 8.00pm,watch television    
 until 9.00pm and then it's off to bed.</content>
