		<title>09ENVILLE'S FARM,MORETON</title>
		<content> Enville's Farm is a part of Ongar     
 Farms Ltd..The whole farm covers 800  
 acres,3 of which are taken up with    
 Greens Vineyard.                      
 100 acres is oilseed rape,100 acres   
 barley,510 acres wheat and 42 acres   
 grassland.The balance is deciduous    
 woodland,farmyards and roads. The     
 crops are rotated every 7 years.The   
 average size of field is 60-70 acres. 
 The farm also buys beef cattle in the 
 spring, grazes them through the       
 summer,and then sells them in the     
 autumn for meat.They are mostly       
 Herefords and Fresians.               
 The earth is heavy boulder clay, which
 is an orange/brown colour. Underneath 
 the clay is chalk. The meadow fields  
 have been kept as grassland as the    
 soil is too rich for crops.The        
 rainfall is 20-23 inches, which is    
 low.                                  </content>
