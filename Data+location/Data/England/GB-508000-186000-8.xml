		<title>08RUISLIP TRANSPORT EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>   There are 4 underground stations    
 Ruislip, Ruislip Manor and Eastcote on
 the Piccadilly and Metropolitan lines 
 and,on the Central line, West Ruislip 
 which is a British Rail interchange.  
 There are several London Transport    
 buses and Elmtree an independent firm.
 We did a survey which transport was   
 used to get to work. 80/137 or 58%    
 went by car. 24/137 or 18% went by    
 train 7/137 or 5% went by bus and the 
 remaining 26 or 19% walked. This ties 
 up with a survey of where people      
 worked with 75% commuting to work.    
 Many of the commuters interviewed on  
 Eastcote Station held professional    
 jobs. A more general survey found     
 97/272 people or 36% worked in offices
 35/272 or 13% in factories 23/272 or  
 8% worked in shops. Unemployment is   
 low with people moving here for work, 
 but the cost can be prohibitive.      </content>
