		<content> In Golders Green the people are{multi-
{cultural}(some of them are visitors). 
 There are also foreign things and food
 for the people from the different     
 countries. The{many restaurants}are   
 from all over the world. There are    
 also{synagogues, temples, churches and
{other places of worship.              
 The main shopping street is Golders   
 Green Road which has shops, super-    
 markets, newsagents, chemists and a   
 cinema. Because of all the shops some 
 people sometimes don't get a proper   
 parking space so they have to park in 
 a different part of Golders Green.    
 The houses in the side streets have   
{big gardens}for children to play so   
 that they don't have to play on the   
 streets. Some roads are very quiet and
 the houses have{Neighbourhood Watch   
 stickers on the door so that bad      
 people will not rob the houses.       </content>
