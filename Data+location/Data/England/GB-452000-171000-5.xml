		<title>05LOCAL HISTORY OF FRILSHAM</title>
		<content> The village of{Frilsham}is in         
 Berkshire 8 miles from{Newbury}and 10 
 miles from{Reading.}Its name          
 originally Fripels Ham was Frilesham  
 in the 11th century and Frylesham by  
 the 16th. The area of the parish is   
 978 acres. It is without a centre.    
 There is an area of recreation land   
 but it can hardly be called a village 
 green. It has{240 inhabitants}and is  
 the hub of the farming community.     
 There are few{amenities}in the village
 itself; no shop, no school, no garage,
 no post-office. It is a quiet peaceful
 place in beautiful countryside and has
 changed little over the years. It     
 could be very frustrating for young   
 people-there is nothing for them to   
 do! It is dominated by its beautiful  
 church. It has retained a nineteenth  
 century character though motor car and
 telephone have  changed{village life.}</content>
