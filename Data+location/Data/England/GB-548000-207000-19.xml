		<title>19ST.MARY'S- MAGDALEN LAVER</title>
		<content> &amp; MAGDALEN laver were worked together 
 &amp; in 1978 were made a united benefice.
 Little Laver was detached from Moreton
 &amp; added to the two in 1985, the parish
 of Matching made the total 4. These   
 changes enabled the sale of rectorys  
 thereby helping to ease financial     
 problems for the church centrally. The
 effect locally has been to change the 
 role of the parish priest into a      
 peripatetic 'master of ceremonies'    
 subject to a diversity of demanding   
 roles, not the least of which is      
 trying to produce and sustain         
 programmes of worship which cause     
 least problems for a range of tastes  
 from High Anglo-Catholic to Low       
 Evangelical. Possibly the greatest    
 pressure on the incumbent is the      
 responsibility for maintaining an     
 historic building on falling income.
