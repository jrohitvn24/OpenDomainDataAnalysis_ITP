		<content> We met the Secretary of the{fishing   
{club}so he could take us along by the 
 river bank. He said the best part is  
 where we started. As we were walking  
 along we saw some{Jersey heifers.}We  
 saw about fifteen rabbits and then we 
 saw a fish head on the ground which   
 was a roach's head. Later on we saw a 
 swan with two grey cygnets and then we
 saw a{heron.}We walked to the tenth   
 gate. On the way back we each found a 
 thistle and we heard a{bullfrog }     
 croaking in the rushes. To join the   
 club costs five pounds for grown-ups  
 and three pounds for juniors. There   
 are about 150 members from Glynde and 
 about 15 members from outside Glynde. 
 The kind of fish in there are roach,  
 bream, carp, perch, gudgeon, eel,     
 dace and pike. Beside the river       
 badgers have been seen and sometimes  
 cormorants.                           </content>
