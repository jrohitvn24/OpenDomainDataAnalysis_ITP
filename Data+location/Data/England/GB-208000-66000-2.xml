		<content> FARMING Farms in this area are not    
 generally very big and many are       
 smallholders with under 50 acres.     
   The good farmland is all intensively
 managed and supports large numbers of 
 animals.The bigger farms grow some    
 arable crops.Some of the land is      
 enclosed grazings which are either    
 privately or more usually used by     
 farmers with commons grazing          
 rights.There is also a small amount of
 land that has moorland vegitation     
 usually this is also subject to       
 commons grazing rights.               
    Farms with dairy herds are few     
 and they do not have large herds.Most 
 farms are beef and sheep farms,those  
 with commons grazings usually have a  
 suckler herd producing beef.
