		<content>   The district is part of the Ria     
 Estuary of the Fal and from the hilly 
 ground on the West many small streams 
 drain through deeply cut valleys to   
 Coombe,Cowlands &amp; Lamouth Creeks in   
 the East,&amp; Penpol in the South.       
   From the detached bungalows &amp; houses
 in Playing Place people commute to    
 Truro, which is the market town.About 
 500 live here, with another 500       
 scattered nearby. More than half have 
 2 cars because of the scarcity of     
 public transport.                     
   The 19th. century estates have been 
 broken up and the houses used for     
 other purposes; holiday flats, school 
 and N.T. headquarters. The owners are 
 still held in high esteem for         
 historical rather than practical      
 reasons.                              
   This is a pleasant area untouched by
 any kind of industrial development.   </content>
