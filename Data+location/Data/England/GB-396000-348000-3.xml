		<title>03Amenities in Wetley Rocks.</title>
		<content>There is a lack of amenities in our    
area.There are at present a number of  
small village shops but really we need 
a big supermarket so that people would 
not have to travel to Hanley,Cheadle or
Newcastle to do their weekly shopping. 
A health centre,more doctors and a     
dentist would help the village,        
particularly the elderly. A leisure    
centre, a theatre and a cinema would   
improve entertainment. These facilities
at the moment are a long way away and  
we have to have a car to get to them as
the bus services are very limited.     
However,If we had all these things it  
would spoil the quiet and peaceful     
nature of the village. Space would     
have to be made which would mean part  
of the old village being destroyed.    
Most people would prefer that the      
village stayed the same.
