		<content>    We were asked by our Geography     
 master to consider what the Domesday  
 Project had meant to us. When we      
 started to discuss our findings in    
 class, we realised that we had learnt 
 more than we thought we would.        
    All the people that we talked to   
 were very friendly and helpful and we 
 felt that we had learnt a lot about   
 the community. Some of the older      
 people were pleased to have someone to
 share their memories with.            
    As well as our dealings with       
 people, we also had to learn about map
 reading, where to find out            
 information, how to plan the visits,  
 what questions to ask and how to      
 summarise all the results.
