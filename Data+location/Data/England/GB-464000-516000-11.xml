		<title>11INDUSTRY - Iron mining.</title>
		<content>      In our survey there were{four    
{mines.}Each one was an{iron-stone     
 mine. All of the mines are{closed     
 because the ore has run out or it is  
 too dangerous to mine. Most of the    
 mines{opened in the mid 1800's}and    
{closed in the 1960's.                 
      The mine spoil-heaps have been   
 levelled and{landscaped.}As the mines 
 are now closed, the mining{houses have
{been demolished}because nobody is     
 living in them. The levelled spoil    
 heaps are now spaces for{recreation   
 and leisure. At Margrove Park the     
 South Skelton mine-heaps have been    
 used for a BMX track.                 
      In Lingdale{new housing estates  
 and a{community centre}were built     
 in 1980. The old mining buildings have
 now been used for a{light-industrial  
{estate.
