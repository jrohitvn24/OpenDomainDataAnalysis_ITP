 Two families work at Higher Bruckland 
 farm. Mr Holmes the Farmer gets up at 
 a quarter to six.                     
                                       
   His first job is to get the cows for
 milking at 6 0'Clock. Mr Holmes       
 finishes his work between six o'clock 
 and ten in the evening.               
                                       
   Mr Holmes has Saturdays off and the 
 other family works on the farm.       
 Some of the crops that they grow are  
 wheat, barley and oats. Some of the   
 machines they use are tractors, a     
 mowing machine,a forage wagon, a      
 baler,four trailors, some ploughs, a  
 cultivating machine, and some rollers.
 They use some of the crops for their  
 own stock but some of it they sell.
