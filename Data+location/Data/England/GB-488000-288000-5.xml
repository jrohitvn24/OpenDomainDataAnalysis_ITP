		<title>05A Shopping Trip, Corby</title>
		<content>If you go to Corby Town Centre on a    
Saturday there will almost certainly be
an open air market in the Market       
Square. A market is a place where there
are stalls which have items to be sold 
on them. In Corby market the majority  
of stalls sell clothes. Another of the 
popular stalls is the jewellery stall. 
Sometimes you can also see young       
pavement artists who chalk pictures on 
the paving stones. In the centre of    
Queen's Square in the summer there is a
large fountain. In the summer the      
fountain is usually flowing but in the 
winter it is drained and left empty.   
Supermarkets are large stores which    
sell a wide variety of foods. The large
supermarkets in Corby are Sainsbury's, 
International Food Stores, Kwik Save   
and Presto. There are many other shops 
in Corby but not many are chain stores.
