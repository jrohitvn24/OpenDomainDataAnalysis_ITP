		<title>05BRIGHSTONE CHURCH HALL</title>
		<content>  The village hall in Brighstone is    
 named after Wilberforce who           
 abolished slavery. It is a            
 large building. It is very spacious   
 inside and at one end there is a small
 kitchen and toilets for ladies and    
 gentlemen.                            
  The floor of the hall is made of wood
 and there is a badminton court marked 
 on it. Badminton is played regularly  
 here, sometimes people come over from 
 the mainland for matches!             
  Other uses for this very busy hall   
 are  for parish coucil meetings,jumble
 sales, fairs, fetes and the children's
 play group. Once a year children from 
 the local Primary school perform their
 play on the stage here.               
  Every week a lady comes to check the 
 lights and to see generally that      
 everything is alright.
