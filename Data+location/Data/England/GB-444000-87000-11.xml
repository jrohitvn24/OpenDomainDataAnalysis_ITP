		<title>11Betty Haunt Lane,Park Cross.</title>
		<content> The curiously named Betty Haunt Lane  
 runs 1.5 kilometres through our area. 
 The lane is said to have been named   
 after Betty, a smuggler's daughter who
 lived two centuries ago.It is said she
 helped the smugglers by entertaining  
 the Customs officers while they crept 
 past with the goods.But one day Betty 
 fell in love with one of the customs  
 men and told him all the smugglers    
 secrets.Most smugglers were captured, 
 but some escaped to return to strangle
 Betty, whose spirit is said to haunt  
 the lane.It may simply be that the    
 name 'haunt' derives from a dialect   
 word for a horse or cattle pound. The 
 nearby 400 year old public house the  
 Blacksmith's Arms is also claimed to  
 be haunted, having been the scene of  
 two murders this century.Two 18th.    
 century Admiralty cottages in the     
 lane,may have housed customs officers.</content>
