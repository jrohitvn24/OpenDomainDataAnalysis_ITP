 cereals.It is combined qith Cosford   
 Grange Farm which concentrates on pig 
 rearing to provide a total of 420     
 acres.The combined farms produce much 
 of the feed they require,growing      
 150acres of Barley,55acres of potatoes
 and 61 acres of sugar beet and buying 
 in the rest.                          
  The farm rears Aberdeen Angus cross  
 for beef production.The animals are   
 kept indoors as much as possible.They

 14 tractors,5 combine harvesters and 3
 balers.They often do contract work for
 neighbours.The cattle are fed on crush
