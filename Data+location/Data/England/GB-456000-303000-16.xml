		<content>{Diwali}is a{Hindu}celebration and is  
 as important as Christmas is to       
 Christians. It marks the victory by   
{Lord Ram}over the evil{Ravanna.}When  
 he returned to his kingdom after 14   
 years exile, his capital city was lit 
 to celebrate his arrival. Today Hindus
 light night-lights around their homes 
 and tell the{Ramayana}story when they 
 visit relatives. Elders give the young
 money and, in return, they show       
 respect by bowing. For Hindus, Diwali 
 is a special time when they eat lots  
 of special foods, eg.{Coconut Barfi, }
 exchange presents and Diwali cards, as
 well as dance and sing. The menfolk   
 gamble, having been blessed by{       
{Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth.}Ladies
 paint{Alpana}patterns on floors and   
 pretty{Rangoli}patterns on their hands
 using{Mendhi.}The streets are         
 decorated with fairy lights.          </content>
