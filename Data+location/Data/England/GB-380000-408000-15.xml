		<content> 1985 was the centenary year of Bury   
 F.C. and they gained promotion to the 
 Third Division of the Football League.
 The club has won the F.A. Cup twice in
 the early years of the century,beating
 Southampton 4-0 in 1900 and Derby Co. 
 6-0 in 1903 ( still a record score ). 
 The playing pitch is one of the       
 largest and best in the country       
 measuring 112 yards by 72 yards and   
 two groundsmen are employed to keep it
 in good condition. The Club was one of
 the pioneers of floodlighting in 1953.
 There is a thriving Social Club and a 
 Junior Shakers Club for children ( The
 Shakers is the Club nickname ).       
 The ground capacity has recently been 
 drastically reduced to 7,000, but the 
 record gate was 35,000
