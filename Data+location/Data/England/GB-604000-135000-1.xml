 by way of small, sheep grazed,        
 undulating fields to the Romney marsh.

 centred round the pub, shop/post      
 office, fire station, butcher, school 
 village hall and playing fields.  The 
 mediaeval church is 1 KM to the       
 northeast amid a large area of        
 cultivated arable land which is owned 
 principally by one family.  Southwards
 is an Evangelical free chapel. a home 
 for Mentally Handicapped adults and a 
 Detention Centre.  Bonnington has a   
 population of 100, 32 houses, a

 villages are over 200 years old.  The 
 people are a mixture of young families
 and retired.                          </content>
