		<title>07OLD BOARDING HOUSES HERNEBAY</title>
		<content> In 1985 there are no longer sufficient
 residential holiday makers to fill the
 old boarding houses which still line  
 the Herne Bay seafront. Many of these 
 buildings are tall and expensive to   
 maintain and although some are now    
 just private houses, usually they are 
 too large for the average family and  
 their use is rather more varied.      
 Sometimes a family might live in the  
 lower part of the house and keep an   
 upper flat to be let out to students  
 or holiday makers. Sometimes the whole
 house is divided into small flats     
 often with students from Canterbury   
 University paying from Â£20 a week for 
 a room with a shared bathroom and     
 kitchen. Also some of the larger      
 houses have been turned into old      
 people's homes.
