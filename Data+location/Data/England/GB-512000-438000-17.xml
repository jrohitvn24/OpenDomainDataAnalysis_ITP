		<content> In Skirlaugh every year a gala takes  
 place on the village playing field.   
 There are decorated lorries and one   
 carries the Gala Queen and two little 
 princesses who are chosen from the    
 girls in the village.As well as the   
 decorated lorries there is a fancy    
 dress  and pet show.  This year       
 we are having a  fun run and 450      
 people are taking part in it.There is 
 a 3km run and a 10km run and any age  
 can join in the fun.Theres an other   
 event called Bonfire night that takes 
 place in the field next door to the   
 playing fields.Theres always a guy    
 that goes on the top of the bonfire   
 .This happens because of Guy Fawkes   
 who planned to blow up the houses of  
 parliament on the 5th of November     
 1605.
