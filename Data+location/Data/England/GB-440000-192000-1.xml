  The two villages in our D-block, East
and West Hanney,are both rural villages
surrounded by farmland. Both villages  
are quiet,peaceful places with only the
noise of traffic and country sounds to 
be heard.                              
VILLAGE GREENS.                        
  Both villages have a village green   
for villagers to sit, play or relax on.
The green in West Hanney has a memorial
cross on it.                           
GALLOWS BRIDGE.                        
  On the road out of West Hanney,as you
drive towards Charney Bassett,you come 
to Gallows Bridge. This made us shudder
as we thought of people being hung and 
thrown into the water afterwards.      
ROMAN ROAD.                            
  The Roman Road goes through East     
Hanney, on the way to Oxford.
