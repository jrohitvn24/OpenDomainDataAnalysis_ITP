		<title>13SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Every Saturday my mum and I go to the 
{New Strand}for our weekly shopping as 
 there are some large shops there      
 including several supermarkets. We go 
 by car because it is quicker than the 
 bus. It only takes about 10 minutes   
 from our house. Once there we park in 
 a multi-storey car park.              
   For odd things during the week like 
 washing-up liquid, soap or a bag of   
 sugar we use the local shops which are
 about 400 yards from our house. We    
 also prefer to buy our meat from the  
 local butcher as it seems fresher than
 the large supermarkets.               
   When we need furniture we go to{MFI}
 or{Liverpool}town centre. {MFI}is a   
 very large furniture store with many  
 branches throughout the country. We   
 also buy some items from a{catalogue} 
 as payment can be spread over 20      
 weeks.        Sarah Cookson aged 11.  </content>
