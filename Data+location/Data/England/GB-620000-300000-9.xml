 Known locally as Gowthorpe Manor, the 
 earliest part dates from 1574. It is  
 built of red brick, with rose,mary and
 pantiled roof, and has thirty rooms.  
 It is owned by the Steward family.    
 Dunston Hall (GR225021)               
 Built in 1859 and replacing a previous
 hall much damaged in the Civil War, it
 was the home of the Long family. The  
 estate was sold in l957 and since then
 the hall has had varied uses.         
 Stoke Holy Cross Hall (GR243007)      
 This Elizabethan mansion was          
 demolished in 1935 after tragedies in 
 the Birkbeck family who owned it.     
 Swainsthorpe Hall                     
 There  is not one. The Long family    
 used to own all Swainsthorpe so       
 Dunston Hall was looked upon as its   
 Hall.
