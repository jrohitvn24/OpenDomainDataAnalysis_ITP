		<content>Jubilee House was built for the Girl   
Guides of Oxfordshire and was opened   
in 1975. Cub Scouts, Scouts and the    
local Brownie Guide Unit meet in it. It
is also used for Guider Committee      
meetings, training sessions and        
conferences. In holiday time and       
weekends Brownies use the house and    
grounds for Pack Holidays and Guides   
camp in its surroundings. The house is 
a single storied building. It has a    
main hall with dormitories, a kitchen  
and toilets. There is also a store for 
camp equipment in the grounds. Jubilee 
House is situated at Woodperry on the  
road from the White House to           
Horton-cum- Studley.
