		<title>04BARNACK VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Barnack dates  back a long way.Like   
 most villages its centre is the       
 church, which is partly Saxon and     
 Norman.The oldest buildings are close 
 to the church-The Old Corner House    
 -1684,The Old Post Office-1786 Cedar  
 House-1814,and Kingsley House -author 
 of The Water Babies.They are built of 
 old limestone called Barnack          
 Ragstone-the rooves are Collyweston   
 slate,blue slate and some are thatched
 Many of the walls are very old with   
 interesting features-a stone arched   
 doorway and gargoyles.The old school  
 which is now the village hall was     
 built in 1864 and used as a school    
 until the 1950's.In the 1950's        
 other houses on the Uffington and     
 Bainton Road were built-between them  
 are large trees which are excellent   
 for dens and hideouts.The present     
 school was built in the 1950's.       </content>
