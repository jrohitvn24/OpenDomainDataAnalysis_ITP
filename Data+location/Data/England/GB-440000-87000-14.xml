		<content>    The{newest}thing in the church is  
 the{New Order of Prayer.}There is a   
 new{hymn book}with more modern hymns. 
 It has 200 new hymns plus the best of 
 the old ones.                         
    A small{crucifix}was rescued from a
 bonfire some years ago. It was found  
 in a brick wall when someone in the   
 village was doing up their house. It  
 is made of a kind of gum.             
    It used to hang on the wall over   
 the{pulpit}but they have put it away  
 now for safety.                       
    A little{red lamp}burns in the     
 chancel.It means there is always      
 somebody somewhere{praying. }         
    There are two{war memorials.}One is
 a window.There is a tiny submarine and
 a tiny aeroplane hidden in the design.
 There are door curtains with fine     
 embroidery on them.
