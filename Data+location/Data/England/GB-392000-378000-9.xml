		<content> Livestock at "Homestead Farm" are fed 
 in the natural way without additives  
 or growth-promoting hormones mixed    
 with their food &amp; little artificial   
 fertiliser used on the land.The goats 
 are kept for their milk &amp; meat. Milk  
 is sold through carefully selected    
 health-food shops in the neighbourhood
 The farm shop offers kidmeat and a    
 variety of goat cheeses, many made    
 with herbs,fruits or liqueurs. These  
 cheeses have won many prizes at recent
 Cheshire Shows. Kids are also sold for
 breeding and the Angora goat bears a  
 valuable fleece. Wool from the sheep  
 goes to the Wool Board and fleeces are
 sold at the farm. Tamworth pig meat   
 has a unique flavour and goes into the
 very popular herb-sausages and bacon  
 and hams, which are sweet cured or    
 smoked over apple wood rubbed with    
 honey and molasses.                   </content>
