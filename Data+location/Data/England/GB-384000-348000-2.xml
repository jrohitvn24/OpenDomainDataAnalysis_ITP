		<content>  On May 17th,a group of us went to    
Simpsons Pottery works where we watched
them making tableware.First of all we  
observed where the raw materials were  
delivered,there was sand,ball clay and 
grog(old broken ware).It was put into a
big machine and mixed up.There were    
manylarge noisy machines all over the  
factory.There was even a big robot arm 
that picked up many dishes that had to 
be cut into shape.First of all it was  
manto clay then put into moulds,then   
it was left to dry for a while.After   
that it was filed down to prevent sharp
edges,they sprayed it with fine        
particles of glass and left it to dry. 
Next they were put in a large kiln for 
16 hours.After cooling they were       
inspected for damage.Finally they were 
packed away ready for transport to the 
shops.
