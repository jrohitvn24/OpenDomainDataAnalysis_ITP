		<title>04MEMORIES OF HORTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    Uncle Bob attended Horton School   
 between 1931 and 1937, until he was   
 fourteen years old.There were between 
 70 and 80 pupils and three teachers.  
    The children had school meals for  
 2s and 6d per week at Chapel House.   
 They were served a main meal and a    
 pudding, usually boiled rice with a   
 spoonful of jam or treacle.In winter  
 they also had a cup of hot chocolate. 
    Christmas parties were held at     
 Horton Hall.There was a large         
 decorated Christmas tree.On it was a  
 wrapped present for every child.After 
 tea and games they were given an      
 orange, some sweets and a new shilling
 coin.The Harford family paid for it   
 all.                                  
     The headteacher's husband ran a   
 boys' club after school. He would     
 teach them to swim in the lake at     
 Horton Court.             Emma Cordy  </content>
