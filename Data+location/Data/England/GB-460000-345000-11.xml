		<content> The bad economic climate,racial issues
 and striking teachers are affecting   
 our schools.Some older people think   
 most children do very well,have plenty
 of choice and are well-behaved.       
 People like a community-spirit,good   
 behaviour,smart dress,happy and polite
 children and nice school fields.They  
 say the action of teachers is hurting 
 the image of the village school,is    
 disruptive and unnecessary;that       
 schools need more money to be more    
 efficient."They should teach four     
 Rs:Reading,wRiting,Reckoning,and Right
 from wRong!".                         
 Mr.G.Ellis,the head of the village    
 Primary,commented,"In spite of the    
 current unrest,the school continued to
 demand excellence.New syllabi in Topic
 and Science were introduced.Our end-of
 -term concert is'David',by Roger      
 Jones,with 3 Redhill pupils playing"  </content>
