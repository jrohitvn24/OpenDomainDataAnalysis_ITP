		<title>12Customs: Beating the Bounds</title>
		<content>      We live very close to the market 
 town of Helston and are involved in   
 many of the things which take place   
 there.                                
      One ancient custom which we are  
 invited to is {Beating the Bounds. }We
 follow the boundary between the Parish
 of Helston and our Parish of Wendron. 
 When we reach a boundary stone, made  
 from granite, which is {hard}, the    
 people are turned upside down and     
 their heads are bumped on the stone   
 three stones.  This is so that they   
 will remember where they are!  We then
 beat the stone with sticks.  All this 
 takes place on Ascension Eve and used 
 to be led by the Cross and the Church 
 Choir, but not any longer.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
