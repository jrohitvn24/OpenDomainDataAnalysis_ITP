		<title>15EDUCATION - PLAYTIME</title>
		<content>We have a big playground, an adventure 
and a big field. We play chicken fights
where two people walk on a log         
supported above the ground on blocks   
and we try to push each other off.     
Trisha and her friends play 44. This   
is when a person hides her eyes and    
counts up to 44 while the other        
children hide. The counter then goes   
to look for the other children. If she 
sees them she rushes back to the       
counting post and shouts out '44, I    
see ....', whoever it was. The         
children can save themselves by        
getting back to the post before they   
are called out. If the last child gets 
back, they can save all of them and the
counter has to do it again. Most of the
boys like playing football which is    
very boring. We do handstands and      
skipping  and sing songs.
