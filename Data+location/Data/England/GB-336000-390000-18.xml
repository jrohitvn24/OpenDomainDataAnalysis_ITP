		<content> The telephone exchange is located at  
 the corner of Doric Rd and Wharncliffe
 Rd.It is now called a 'Director       
 Exchange' and it covers several       
 districts including Stony Croft, Old  
 Swan and West Derby.There are about   
 24000 subscribers in the area mostly  
 residential and some commercial. The  
 exchange was built in 1934 as a manual
 exchange and converted in 1952 into an
 automatic,using Stowger equipment.2   
 more exchanges were added in 1965 and 
 1974.There are plans in the next few  
 years to install the very latest      
 equipment called System X.
