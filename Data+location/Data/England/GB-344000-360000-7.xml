		<title>07Farming in SW.Cheshire(2)</title>
		<content> Farms may be large but farm workers   
 are few e.g.Hatton farm has 3;Hatton  
 Hall farm 3;Coldharbour Farm 1 &amp; 1    
 part-timer (the farmer's wife) this   
 being the only farm in the area to be 
 part of a co-operative.The co-op helps
 with low interest loans for machines, 
 offers advice etc.Farms may buy in    
 winter feed but some grow cereals &amp;   
 all grow hay &amp; silage the latter often
 stored under plastic sheets weighted  
 with old tyres.The Grosvenor Estate   
 grows rapeseed in large quantities,   
 mainly for fodder &amp; by the A41 road 2 
 small fields of sweet corn,unripe even
 in September after a particularly cold
 &amp; wet summer must also be for fodder. 
 Small areas of waste land are along a 
 disused branch railway line,in Platts 
 Lane where an old marl pit is being   
 in-filled with rubble from roadworks &amp;
 in a field in the NW.by the canal.    </content>
