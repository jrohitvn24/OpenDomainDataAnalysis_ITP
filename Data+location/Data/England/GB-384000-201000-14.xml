		<title>14CYCLE TRACK STROUD</title>
		<content>{    WOODCHESTER RAILWAY RE-USED       
      Since 1982,Stroud has been       
 building a cycle track along the      
 course of the old Midland Railway     
 branch line from Nailsworth to Stroud 
 and onto Stonehouse.Cyclists like it  
 because it follows the valley bottom. 
 So far 7 miles of track have been     
 completed despite many difficulties   
 and the final 3 miles to Nailsworth   
  will be completed by the end of 1985.
      The venture started as the result
 of a competition run by local Quakers 
 looking for suggestions on how to     
 lower local unemployment and to help  
 the local community.A cycle track was 
 one of the winning entries.The        
 government has provided a grant for   
 the scheme.                           
     The track has proved popular with 
 pedestrians and cyclists and safe.An  
 adjacent BMX track is very popular.   </content>
