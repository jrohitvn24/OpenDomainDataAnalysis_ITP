		<content> On July 3rd. 1985 we went to interview
 Mr. Arthur Chase, Chairman of the     
 Parish Council, on the subject of     
 local housing.                        
{HOUSES AND HOUSING PLANS.}Lechlade    
 contains 540 houses and 49 more have  
 received planning permission. In      
 eighteen months 61 houses have been   
 built.                                
{TYPES.}Council houses total 133 and   
 407 are privately owned. There are 147
 buildings in Cotswold Stone.          
{INFILLING.}Infilling areas are to be  
 between Chancel Way and the Convent,  
 off Sherborne Street and off Hambidge 
 Lane.                                 
{FLATS}There are plans to build 35     
 flats on the playing field at a cost  
 of approximately Â£28,000 each. These  
 are intended for retired folk and     
 first time buyers.
