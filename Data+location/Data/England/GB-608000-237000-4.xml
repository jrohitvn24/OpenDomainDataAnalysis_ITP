		<content>Capel is a great place for children.   
A Sports week is held during the summer
when most of the sports clubs are      
closed.Once a year we have a Fun Day   
-stalls,games and competitions held on 
the playing field.After certain events 
there are family evenings in the       
village hall.                          
During the winter the is a day when    
synthetic ice is brought to Capel and  
you can hire skates for the day.       
One morning in May a Fun Run is held.  
This is a 3 mile run round Capel.Every 
year certain societies sponsor the run.
Capel St Mary has its own dramatic     
society,the Orchard Players,who give   
shows and pantomimes during the year
