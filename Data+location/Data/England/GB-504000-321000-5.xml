		<content> Edenham Church is dedicated to        
 St.Michael and all Angels.It is rather
 big and there is a Vicarage at the    
 back.Walking through the gate you can 
 see tomb stones and Cedar trees and   
 sometimes people mourning.As you come 
 into the Church itself there is a     
 door on the right leading up into the 
 towers.In front there is an open door 
 (shut at night) which leads to the    
 main room.There are stained glass     
 windows to:St.Catherine,St. Paul,the  
 Apostles,St.Michael and all Angels and
 Jesus.In September to October people  
 donate some of their crops to the     
 Church and then the food is delivered 
 to the elderly.Sometimes the ten bells
 peal out.The organ was repaired too.A 
 lady called Miss.B.Stainsby plays it  
 when we use it.There is a Sunday      
 School each Sunday.Our vicar is       
 leaving in July.                      </content>
