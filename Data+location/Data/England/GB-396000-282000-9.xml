		<content>    A new shopping precinct was built  
 in 1969. Open to pedestrian traffic,  
 vehicles were diverted along the      
 Queensway, parking being provided free
 for shoppers and business.            
    A bus station is sited alongside   
 the precinct. Bus services provide    
 access to the majority of neighbouring
 villages,towns and cities.            
    Roads to Birmingham, Kidderminster 
 Dudley and Stourbridge by-pass the    
 town centre preventing traffic hold   
 ups. The M5 motorway allows access to 
 the South West and the rest of the    
 motorway system.                      
    The headquarters of the Automobile 
 Association (A.A.) are based in       
 Halesowen.                            
    The railway was closed in 1968.
