		<title>19A mother's day in B.S.E.</title>
		<content>  A normal day begins at about 6-30am  
with a shower and hairwash. Then she   
puts some oldish clothes on. She makes 
the lunches, irons any clothes needed  
that day, gets the breakfast and sees  
us off to school.                      
  Then, every day except Tuesday and   
Thursday, it's a dash upstairs, a quick
change into decent clothes, a dab of   
make up here and there, and off to     
work. She drives to work which takes   
about 10 minutes, then works from      
9.00am till about 1.00pm, depending on 
the amount of work.                    
  After that, she either comes home or 
does the shopping. When she does get   
home, she starts the cleaning, either  
dusting or hoovering. When that's      
finished for the day, she starts on tea
which we eat when we come in about     
4.00pm. The house is then in a mess    
till bedtime.                          </content>
