		<content> Ashchurch School was built in 1842    
 by the church who employed the        
 architect William Hill Knight.When the
 school was built it was a National    
 School. Later it was changed to a     
 Board School (in 1872).The datestone  
 on the front of the school says       
 "ASHCHURCH BOARD SCHOOLS A.D.1842.    
 Glory to God in the Highest." The     
 original building was divided into two
 schools, one for the girls and one for
 the boys.The girls' room was much     
 smaller than the boys'.Behind the     
 school was the master's house.There   
 were some stairs coming into the      
 school.The school was enlarged in 1894
 when they added the main building     
 which is now the library.All the other
 classrooms (mostly temporary          
 buildings)were built in the 1950's;two
 are about to be demolished.There are  
 now 132 children in the school.       </content>
