		<title>02OLD &amp; NEW IN PULBOROUGH.</title>
		<content> The A29 road through Pulborough       
 follows the old Roman Stane Street,   
 going from London to Chichester. A    
 causeway, still used, took the road   
 across the river marshes. Two bridges 
 cross the river at Swan Corner, a new 
 bridge and old disused stone bridge   
 built in 1738 to replace a wooden     
 bridge. There are many old houses. A  
 hump of ground called The Moat was the
 site of the old manor house, burnt    
 down about 1200. New Place Manor was  
 built of stone nearby, in 1252 A.D.   
 Part of this old house is left with a 
 big inglenook fire place with little  
 stools in it. It has a very old 16th  
 century dove cote, now without doves. 
 Old Place, near the church, is an old 
 manor house, built about 1450, with a 
 medieval hall and a fish pond. 16th.  
 century Old Cottage on Church Hill was
 possibly once used by smugglers.      </content>
