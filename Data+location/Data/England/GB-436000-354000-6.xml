		<title>06SOUTH WINGFIELD _ SHOPPING</title>
		<content> There are six shops in our area and a 
 souvenir shop at Wingfield Manor.     
 These are a general store, sweet shop,
 haberdashery, Post Office, hairdresser
 and mill shop.  There are also seven  
 inns and pubs which have off_licences.
                                       
 We surveyed 55 adults and found that  
 52 of these did the bulk of their     
 shopping  in supermarkets in          
 Alfreton.Three others travelled       
 further afield.  Thirty_nine people   
 shopped once per week and eight       
 several times per week.  The village  
 shops were used to purchase forgotten 
 or 'odd' items.  Mobile shops also    
 call selling fish &amp; chips and         
 greengroceries.                       
                                       
 The village was once self_sufficient  
 with many more shops such as a small  
 supermarket and bakers.               </content>
