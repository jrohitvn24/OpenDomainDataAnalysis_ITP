		<title>08BISHOP AUCKLAND - History</title>
		<content> Bishop Auckland grew as a{market town 
 because of the{agriculture}and        
{coal-mines}in the area.               
  When the{Romans}lived here they built
 a road which we now call Watling Road.
 The road which is part of{Dere        
{Street}runs from{Binchester,}where    
 there are remains of the{Roman        
{fort,}to{Piercebridge.}               
 The{market place}has a long history   
 and has recently been modernised.The  
 flow of traffic has been restricted to
 allow more{predestrian access.}       
 There is a{castle}in Bishop Auckland  
 called{Auckland Castle}which has been 
 the seat of many{Bishops of Durham.   
 65% of parents of children from this  
 school work outside Bishop            
 Auckland. This suggests that Bishop   
 Auckland is a{dormitory town.
