		<content>   The Winston Churchill Hall is owned 
 by the G.L.C. and is the largest, most
 luxurious and expensive hall to       
 hire in the area.It sometimes holds   
 weddings and other large occasions    
 such as the Ruislip and Northwood     
 Festival of speech dance and drama.   
 Hillingdon Borough hold concerts      
 there. Keep fit and model exhibitions 
 also take place. Sometimes our school 
 (Whiteheath) goes there for either a  
 concert or play. It has recently been 
 used as a Disco hall.Some people have 
 complained about the noise coming from
 the hall.

 by the Round Table who parade from    
 the Orchard Hotel to the Winston      
 Churchill Hall.
