		<content> Parklands County High School caters   
 for 13-18 age range of Leeds' 3-tier  
 system of education, others being 5-9 
 (primary)  9-13 (middle). Parklands   
 is one of 9 single-sex High Schools in
 Leeds, educating only girls.  650     
 girls are on roll, the annual intake  
 is over 200. Its location makes it a  
 popular choice among Asian parents    
 who live relatively near, and who     
 choose to have their daughters in     
 single-sex schools.  The school, in   
 common with all other Leeds schools,  
 serves primarily its own immediate    
 community, as does nearby Foxwood.This
  provides for girls and boys, and     
 has a large capacity of almost 1000   
 children and an annual intake of 360. 
 Both schools present a broad          
 curriculum and offer a full range of  
 courses, including those leading to   
 university careers.                   </content>
