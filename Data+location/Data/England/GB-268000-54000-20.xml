		<title>20TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Transport is solely private or        
 privately hired.  There is no {PUBLIC 
{TRANSPORT} at all in the area, so it  
 is virtually essential for residents  
 to own their own cars, vans, etc..    
 There is a {SCHOOL MINIBUS} provided  
 and most farmers have {TRACTORS}which,
 apart from normal farm use, are       
 greatly appreciated in winter when    
 more conventional vehicles have       
 problems on the steep hills,          
 especially in snow or icy conditions. 
 Private Hire Coaches are available    
 locally for specific outings arranged 
 by local groups.  There is no petrol  
 filling station in North Huish; the   
 nearest being at Avonwick or at       
 Ugborough.
