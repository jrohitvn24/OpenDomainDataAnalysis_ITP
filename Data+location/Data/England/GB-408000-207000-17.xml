		<content> In a mainly rural area where many     
 houses are occupied by professional   
 and retired people the leisure        
 activities are very varied. The houses
 are generally very well kept, and     
 great pride is taken in the appearance
 of the gardens. Public footpaths and  
 lanes provide opportunities for       
 walking, and riding is a popular      
 pastime. Many people also join in the 
 local fieldsports. One resident is    
 engaged in writing a local history,   
 another restores antique furniture,   
 whilst driving his four-in-hand       
 demands skill for yet another, at the 
 same time providing entertainment and 
 pleasure for others at the Bank       
 Holiday Fete. Dried flower            
 arrangements are expertly made in one 
 cottage while a more exotic pastime   
 is flying a hot air balloon.
