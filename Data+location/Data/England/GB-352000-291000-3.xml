		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> This area has hardly changed from the 
 first Domesday record.The main{change}
 being the prairie-type fields which   
 have appeared in the last 10 years.   
 Originally this block was part of the 
 Royal forest which stretched to       
 Buildwas.In 1983 the{Rushbury District
{Record Trust}had many aerial          
 photos taken of the area.Upper Stanway
 seems to be the original Domesday     
 settlement on a Roman route;the {name}
 Stanway is the Saxon for stoneway.    
 Edge Farm &amp; Longville have mediaeval  
 ridge &amp; furrow fields.There was a     
 primitive Methodist Chapel near to    
 Lakehouse Farm.Wilderhope Manor is now
 a youth hostel and was connected with 
 the Royalists during the Civil War.   
 Mr.F.O.Webb of Stanway Manor was the  
 chief engineer for the London &amp; N.E.  
 Railway in the 19thC and some of his  
 inventions are still in use today.    </content>
