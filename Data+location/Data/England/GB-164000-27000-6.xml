		<title>06THE CATTLE MARKET IN HELSTON</title>
		<content> On Monday's there is a cattle market  
 it seemed large but is probably quite 
 small compared to some others.        
   {About twenty years ago}it moved to 
 a larger site and is now mostly under 
 cover.                                
    When the cattle arrive, they are   
 weighed, put in their pens and        
 numbered. We only saw cattle being    
 sold. Occasionally they sell pigs and 
 sheep as well.                        
  { About 200 animals}are sold each    
 week. The auctioneer stands on a      
 rostrum and he shouts out the prices  
 very quickly whilst looking for bids. 
 The farmers make different signs to   
 him, to show that they are bidding.   
    There is a lot of noise and bustle 
 of farmers doing business. The animals
 seemed to be very frightened.         
                                       
                                       </content>
