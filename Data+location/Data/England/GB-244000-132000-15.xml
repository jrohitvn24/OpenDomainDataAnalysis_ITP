		<title>15Leisure Pursuits</title>
		<content> The area has many advantages for      
 purposeful use of leisure time. The{  
{Marsh}area is splendid for walking and
 cycling as it is so flat. The lanes   
 are almost traffic free (except in    
 summer when many tourists visit the   
 area). The Burrows is an ideal place  
 for taking exercise walking, jogging  
 or nature rambles.                    
   During the last ten years there has 
 been a dramatic increase in the amount
 of sailing and surfing on the coast   
 and in the estuary. This increase is  
 mainly due to the popularity of       
 windsurfing.                          
   Windsurfing is performed on a       
 sailboard - a cross between a yacht   
 and a surfboard.                      
   Several workshops and small         
 factories in and around{Braunton}     
 produce sailboards and windsurfing    
 equipment.                            </content>
