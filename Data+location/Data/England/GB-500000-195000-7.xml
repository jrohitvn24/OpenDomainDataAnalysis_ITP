		<title>07Games Children Play</title>
		<content>In the 1980's children still play games
that have been popular for years such  
as hopscotch, hide and seek and        
skipping. Ball games are also played   
like rounders, cricket and tenis.      
Football is usually played by boys on  
any available open space in teams of   
any size. Netball is a game usually    
played by girls.                       
Games are also played indoors.         
Electronic games have become very      
popular in the last few years with over
half the families of 10/11 year old    
children owning computers. Some games  
can be attached to the T.V. while      
others are hand held. Cards are played 
such as snap, beat your neighbour and  
chase the lady. Some families play     
board games like Cluedo and Snakes and 
Ladders. A popular, more active, game  
is Table Tennis.
