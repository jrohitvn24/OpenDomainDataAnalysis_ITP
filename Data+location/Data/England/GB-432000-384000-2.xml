		<title>02A LOCAL ARTIST</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 21st May, a group of five  
 children went to visit{Joe Scarborough
 a{local artist.}He had black curly    
 hair with a little grey at the sides. 
 He also had a moustache. He wore      
 glasses with silver frames.  He lived 
 in a normal semi-detached house at 44 
 Rupert Road, Sheffield.               
 Mr. Scarborough left school in the    
 l950's with 5 'O' levels. His first   
 job was at Batchelor's pea factory and
 then he went to work down the pit,    
 this made him start painting. When he 
 came out of the{"dirty black pit"}the 
 light dazzled him and{"all the colours
{flared out"}at him.                   
 He now paints street scenes of the    
 l950's. He paints in bright colours   
 like the ones he saw when he came out 
 of the pit. The highest price he has  
 ever been paid for a painting was     
 Â£3,750.                               </content>
