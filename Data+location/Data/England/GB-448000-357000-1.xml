 Sutton being so close to the Derbys.  
 border local words are influenced by  
  both Notts. and Derbys. dialects: for
 example tea is "mashed" rather than   
 "brewed". There is also a tendency for
 certain words to be pronounced with   
 more syllables than in standard       
 English: shoo-es for shoes, co-at for 
 coat. Other words are shortened: wok  
 for work and bods for birds.          
    Many local people also distort some
 words: guz for goes, summat for       
 something, owse for house, missen for 
 myself, om for home and rate for

 might be,"I guz do-an stre-ut tut     
 shop",or "I go down the street to the 
 shop". WENDY MILLARD SIMON KENWORTHY
