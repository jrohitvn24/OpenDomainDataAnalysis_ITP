 Citadel Station opened in 1848 and was
 doubled in size in the 1870's when the
 Victoria Viaduct was built to take the
 road over the lines.The glass roof    
 covers seven acres; today's electric  
 and diesel locos don't obscure it with
 soot.Badges of the Lancaster&amp;Carlisle 
 and Caledonian Companies can be seen  
 above the entrance.                   
 Carlisle is an{open}station. There are
 no barriers or ticket collectors on   
 the platform. BR rely on their Guards 
 (on InterCity trains at least) to     
 check passengers' tickets.VDU's have  
 been installed above the platforms but
 are not yet operational so train info.
 comes from posters, porters, tannoy   
 announcements, or the enquiry office.
