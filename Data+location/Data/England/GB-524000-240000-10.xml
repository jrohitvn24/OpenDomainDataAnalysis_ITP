		<title>10FARMER'S MOTHER INTERVIEWED</title>
		<content> We visited the home of, the farmer who
 showed us round Bluegates. She was    
 given this cottage when she married in
 1936. Mrs. Wolverley Fordham owned it 
 as well as Bluegates Farm, the large  
 house called Ashwell Bury and Mill    
 Street Cottages. The  small three up  
 three down cottage had much added on. 
 Old beams and even an old staircase   
 from the Bury were used. Edward       
 Lutyens the architect removed the     
 latter after a fire at the Bury. We   
 were interested to hear about the     
 lady's brother. We saw a photo of him.
 He was a reconnaisance pilot in WWII. 
 She said he was the sort of man who   
 relished danger. Always a perfect-    
 tionist he returned unofficially a    
 third time to get some better pictures
 and was shot down and killed. He got  
 the DSO. His name was Anthony Eustace 
 Hill, his name is on the church spire.</content>
