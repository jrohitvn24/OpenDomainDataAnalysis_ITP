		<title>04COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY</title>
		<content>    Bromley College of Technology was  
 visited by Raglan Junior School. The  
 principal answered our questions. The 
 college is built on the site of an old
 house whcih was burnt down during the 
 war.  The house was owned by Montague 
 Norman, Governor of the Bank of       
 England.  They teach all kinds of     
 subects at the college such as motor  
 engineering, computer studies,        
 metalwork and home electrics.         
    We liked the computer room best    
 and in one room there was a gigantic  
 computer bigger than a freezer but in 
 the next room there was a smaller     
 computer that could do even more.  It 
 could print 600 letters in just one   
 second.                               
    Most of the people that go to the  
 college live quite close to it. No-one
 lives in the college.
