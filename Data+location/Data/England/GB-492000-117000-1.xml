		<title>01A VIEW OF GRAFFHAM</title>
		<content> Graffham is a small dormitory village 
 south of Petworth and Midhurst.  It is
 tucked into the northern side of the  
 South Downs.  It is very picturesque  
 and has two pubs.  The countryside is 
 gently rolling chalk, mainly covered  
 by woodlands or grazing with an array 
 of wild flowers.  Riding is popular   
 with Ambersham polo ground nearby.    
 Stud farms for polo ponies are a      
 feature.                              
                                       
 There are many clubs and societies.   
 The church is at the top of the       
 village with the attractive flint and 
 timber primary school opposite.       
 Although the road ends here there are 
 many public footpaths over the Downs  
 to the South Downs Way.
