		<content> Hartington has many places which      
 offers work for local people. We did a
 survey to find out how many local     
 people worked in Hartington. The six  
 shops mainly employed people who lived
 in or near the village.The hotels and 
 two public houses employed local part 
 time staff. The cheese factory is the 
 biggest single employer. It employs   
 145 people some of whom live in       
 Hartington.There are two cafes and    
 many small guest houses where         
 employment is seasonal. Besides these,
 employment is provided by the garage, 
 the surgery, the telephone exchange   
 and the farms. One new project is the 
 pottery which sells terra cotta pots  
 which visitors can see being made. It 
 employs three people. In our survey we
 found that tourism provided a great   
 deal of employment.
