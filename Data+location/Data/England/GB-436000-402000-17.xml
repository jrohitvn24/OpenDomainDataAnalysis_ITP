		<content> ABOUT 1 SQUARE KM. IS OCCUPIED BY     
 RAILWAYS. MOST OF THEM ARE USED BY    
 FREIGHT TRAINS ALTHOUGH PASSENGER     
 TRAINS ALSO USE THE LEEDS/SHEFFIELD   
 LINE PASSING THROUGH BARNSLEY AND     
 WOMBWELL. SOME LINES HAVE BEEN CLOSED 
 RECENTLY AS MORE  GOODS ARE BEING     
 CARRIED ON THE ROAD NETWORK. THE AREA 
 IS ALSO CRISS-CROSSED BY NUMEROUS     
 ROADS, RIVERS AND CANALS, AND AS A    
 RESULT THERE ARE AT LEAST 2O MAJOR    
 BRIDGES - 4 RAIL OVER RAIL; 7 ROAD    
 OVER RAIL; 1 ROAD UNDER RAIL; 4 ROAD  
 OVER CANALS OR RIVERS; 4 RAIL OVER    
 CANALS OR RIVERS. THE BRIDGES ARE     
 USUALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE     
 CONCERN WHICH HAD THEM CONSTRUCTED AND
 THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL HAD
 A STAFF OF 3 INSPECTORS CHECKING THEIR
 SAFETY ALL THE TIME AND FOR 1985/6    
 Â£5OO,OOO HAD BEEN SET ON ONE SIDE FOR 
 BRIDGE MAINTENANCE.                   </content>
