		<content> At the extreme end of this block we   
 find the small parish church of Acton 
 Beauchamp. This is a plain, yet       
 attractive building which has been    
 used for worship for about 800 years. 
 Evidence of its age can be seen in the
 very old tombstones which have        
 crumbled away to be almost unrecognis-
 able.  Services are held there twice  
 every month.  The church is part of a 
 large parish with five churches; the  
 others being Bishops Frome, Castle    
 Frome, Evesbatch, and Fromes Hill.Only
 one farm house is near the church and 
 there are very few houses within a    
 mile. Most parishioners from          
 Munderfield, the west side of the     
 block, would attend Bishops Frome     
 church which is the central church    
 with a resident vicar. The church of  
 Avenbury which is just outside the    
 area is now a ruin.                   </content>
