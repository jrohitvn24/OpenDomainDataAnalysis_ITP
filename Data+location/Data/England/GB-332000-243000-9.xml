		<content> The highlights of the year are the    
 Village Fete in aid of St. Andrew's   
 Church, the Harvest Supper, Annual    
 Whist Drive, and the Raft Race. The   
 annual Fete is held on the first      
 Saturday in August in the field       
 opposite the Red Lion Inn. There are  
 produce and bottle stalls, pony rides,
 skittles, hoop-la, games of skill, and
 a lucky dip. There is also an Auction,
 and teas are served in the Village    
 Hall. In 1985 the receipts were about 
 Â£650. The annual Raft Race is held on 
 the River Wye. It starts at Hay-on-Wye
 and finishes at Chepstow, taking three
 days to complete. Bredwardine Bridge  
 is a popular vantage point and timing 
 post. The Race is organised by the    
 Committee for Herefordshire Amateur   
 Rafters, and the proceeds go to       
 charity.
