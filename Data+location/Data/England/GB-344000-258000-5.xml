		<content>   The principal mode of transport is  
 the private automobile.  Travel for   
 those without is extremely difficult. 
   Most places in the area are in      
 theory covered by private bus company 
 services, but, in practice, these can 
 be as infrequent as once a week,      
 running at times suitable to the bus  
 companies rather than the travelling  
 public.  The timetables are only an   
 approximation of the times when buses 
 may arrive or depart.  The drivers    
 know all their passengers and provide 
 a friendly service.                   
   Travel out of the area on Sundays   
 and holidays by public transport is   
 impossible and all services cease in  
 the early evening on other days.      
   The nearest railway station is about
 five miles from the centre of the     
 district.  No buses run to the        
 station;  there is no taxi rank there.</content>
