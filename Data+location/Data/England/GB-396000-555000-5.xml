		<content> The area is served by {Slaley County  
{First School,}which is a modern       
 building of three classrooms and a    
 hall, surrounded by ample grounds and 
 playing fields. The school identifies 
 closely with the community. Children  
 join a {nursery class}held in the     
 mornings when they are three years,   
 transferring to school when they are  
 4+. The headmaster has full-time      
 responsibility for a class of 20 and  
 there are two other classes of 18 and 
 14. The school serves the general area
 of Slaley, Blanchland, Healey and     
 Minsteracres, children beyond 2 miles 
 being transported by minibus. Children
 from the school usually transfer to   
{Corbridge County Middle School}at 9+  
 and then to the{Queen Elizabeth High  
{School,}Hexham at the age of 13+.
