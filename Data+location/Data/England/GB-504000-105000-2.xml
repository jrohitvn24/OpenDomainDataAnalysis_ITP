		<title>02POLING CORNER</title>
		<content> The area we first decided to do the   
 survey on is called Poling Corner.    
 Poling corner is situated amongst     
 arable land.  There are no shops but  
 next to the A27 there was a post      
 office.                               
 Most of the houses have country names 
 and are associated with the farming   
 around it                             
          e.g. Sheperds cottage        
 Around the houses and next to the     
 A27 there are some rape fields these  
 are a bright yellow in colour.        
 From the A27 there is one small       
 narrow lane, along the side of the    
 road there are fences which are       
 covered with wild flowers.  Most of   
 the houses are modern and some are    
 still being built.The houses that are 
 completed are in 1980 style.  There is
 only one church called St Nicholas    
 where renovation is taking place.     </content>
