		<content> Farming, no longer on the scale it    
 once was, is still mainly dairy       
 farming. The milk quota, now an all-  
 important factor, urges these farmers 
 to add dairy related products such as 
 cheese and yoghurt, rather than milk  
 and cream alone. A few rear cattle for
 beef, but in the Mithian and          
 Silverwell area, sheep are being      
 raised on hilly ground. Potatoes,     
 broccoli and other related vegetables 
 are among the crops now grown.        
 A long established Bakery in          
 Churchtown produces fresh bread,      
 rolls, cakes and fancies. The saffron 
 cake is most popular, closely followed
 by the Cornish Gingerbread. Cornish   
 Pasties are their speciality. Hundreds
 of scones are baked daily to meet the 
 demand for Cream Teas. Lettuce,       
 tomatoes and cucumbers are grown in   
 the many large greenhouses.           </content>
