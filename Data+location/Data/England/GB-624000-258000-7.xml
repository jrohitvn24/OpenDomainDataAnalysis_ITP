		<content> The Old Vicarage at Brandeston and the
Old Rectory at Monewden are no longer  
occupied by the incumbent,but the Rect-
or of Kettleburgh lives at the Rectory.
Also at Kettleburgh the former Mill    
house is still in use but as an ordin- 
ary dwelling,the Mill having ceased to 
function many years ago.               
 There are roughly 14 farm houses of   
working farms,with their farm          
buildings.These are all fairly large,  
substantial houses some dating back to 
the 16C.                               
 More recent housing is found in the   
Council house developments both in     
Brandeston &amp; Kettleburgh.Originally    
intended to provide rented             
accommodation many council houses are  
now sold and their new owners seek ways
of breaking the uniformity of design,  
e.g. by adding a porch,or conservatory.
