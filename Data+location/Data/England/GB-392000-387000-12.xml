		<content>     I live in Marple, a village in the
 district of Stockport. Marple is a    
 peaceful place really, not at all that
 busy, you would not expect to find a  
 lot of Nature, but you do.            
     In my garden every winter a little
 grey squirrel and it's family come and
 eat the nuts off the tree. In summer  
 there are lots of different wild      
 flowers and grasses, such as rye      
 grass,  and timothy grass which has a 
 soft furry bit at the top.            
     Some of wild flowers are red ones 
 called poppies, yellow ones called    
 buttercups and lots of others.        
     There are lots of animals such as 
 cows, horses, sheep, pigs and rabbits.
 There are birds such as Robins, Blue  
 Tits, Starlings and Sparrows.         
     Insects are numerous too. There   
 are Beetles, Butterflies and Spiders.
