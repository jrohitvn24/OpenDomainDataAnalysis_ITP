		<content>{B.M.X.}means Bicycle Moto-Cross.It is 
 an American name &amp; idea.A B.M.X.is a  
 very light bicycle with special wheels
 called Mags or Skyways.You either race
 on mud tracks with hills &amp; humps or   
 do free-style where you do stunts.One 
 of the stunts is called a Table-Top   
 where you go up a"Quarter Pipe"(A ramp
 that curves up),come off the top &amp;    
 turn in mid-air &amp; come back down the  
 other way.                            
{BREAK DANCING}is another American     
 craze that has become very popular.It 
 has stopped a lot of vandalism.It     
 consists of spinning on different     
 parts of your body.One of the simplest
 moves is "Crazy-Legs" where you lean  
 on your arms &amp; legs &amp; kick,then move  
 round in circles on 1 arm &amp; spin on   
 your back.The hardest move is the     
 "Halo" where you spin on your head    
 with your arms out,but off the ground.</content>
