		<content> There are not many places of          
 employment in our area and the nearest
 job centre is at Kidderminster or     
 Ludlow. The reason that we don't have 
 many jobs is because most of our      
 country is wasteland and rough        
 grazing. The few places that offer    
 employment are the Foxwood lodge. The 
 crown inn and Hopton bank garage. The 
 Post Offices are run by the families  
 who own them. The farms are small and 
 are run by their owners. Most people  
 travel to work outside the area to    
 factories at Tenbury,Ludlow,Cleobury  
 Mortimer Kidderminster,or drive       
 lorries, or work in offices.
