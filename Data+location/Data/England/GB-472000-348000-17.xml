		<title>17LEISURE IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Leisure activities in the villages of{
{East Stoke}and{Elston}are fairly      
 limited.  Apart from the games of     
 dominoes, skittles, darts and checkers
 played in the local public houses, the
 leisure activities centre mainly on   
 women's organisations.  There is a{   
{Women's Institute}in each village. The
 W.I. hut has recently been refurbished
 with the help of a grant from the     
 Local Authority and is used for       
 village events such as whist drives.{ 
{Elston}has a{Mothers' Union}, a{Mother
{and Toddlers Group}, and a women's    
 section of the{British Legion.}There  
 are occasional handicraft and         
 dress-making courses.  The "Senior    
 Citizens" are catered for by the{     
{Over-60's club.} At present the vicar 
 is attempting to organise a{Youth     
{Club. }                               
                                       </content>
