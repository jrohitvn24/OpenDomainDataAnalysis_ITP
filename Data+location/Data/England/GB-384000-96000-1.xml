       The block is an area of open    
 downland lying between the 50m and    
 100m contours. The land is chalk with 
 flints, but there are large beds of   
 gravel in the valley bottom. The River
 Winterborne, which usually runs       
 between February and June each year,  
 flows roughly west to east through the
 block.                                
       The land is pasture or          
 cultivated for grain crops, almost all
 barley or wheat. There are a few      
 wooded areas planted with mixed       
 conifers and hardwoods.The pasture is 
 used for feeding dairy herds,beef     
 cattle and sheep.                     
       The village of Winterborne      
 Kingston is in the middle of the block
 and there are two other smaller       
 settlements at Winterborne Muston and 
 Winterborne Anderson.                 </content>
