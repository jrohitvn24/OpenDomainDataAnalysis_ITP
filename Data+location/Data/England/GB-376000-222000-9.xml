		<content> Mrs. E.L. Hiam tells us that in the   
 1890's Hartpury had its own           
 tradespeople and provided its own     
 entertainment. At the Methodist Chapel
 Treat the Sunday School children sang 
 and carried banners around the        
 village, finishing with tea, games and
 fireworks. Also annually, the men     
 followed a band around the village    
 returning to the Canning Arms for the 
 Hartpury Feast - the rest enjoyed the 
 roundabouts and stalls in the field   
 opposite. Mr. A. Finch and Mrs. A.D.  
 Underwood remember the first 'bus', in
 the 1920's, was a lorry with seats run
 by Mr. Travell to Gloucester for 3d.  
 Most people travelled around on       
 bicycles. The improvements in         
 transport encourage people to seek    
 employment in Gloucester, as well as  
 visiting other villagers some distance
 away for dances.                      </content>
