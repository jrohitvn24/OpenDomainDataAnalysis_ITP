		<title>13A MORNING AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Nine o'clock the school day starts,   
 we rush in through the cloakroom door,
 change shoes and sit down by the      
 teachers chair. We have register. We  
 line up for assembly. When assembly is
 over we sit down by the teachers chair
 again and are told what work to do. We
 usually have to do maths, writing or  
 reading.                              
 Ten twentyfive it is playtime till    
 10:45. At playtime we go outside.     
 When we come in and get on with our   
 work of physical education, art or    
 finishing off work from before        
 playtime.                             
 At 12 o'clock it is lunch time. Our   
 work goes away,we sit by our teacher  
 then she will send us off for dinner.
