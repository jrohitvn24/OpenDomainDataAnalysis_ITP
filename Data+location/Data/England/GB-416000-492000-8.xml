		<content>{St.John's Church of England.          
 It stands in an isolated position next
 to Church Bank. It is a chapel of ease
 and is registered only for baptisms or
 funerals. About 10 people regularly go
 to services.  Last year they succeeded
 in raising Â£1400 for  urgent  interior
 repairs. You will find the cemetery at
 Patrick Brompton,the parish church.   
                                       
{St.Teresa's:1932-1981                 
 Sadly this small Roman Catholic church
 was  closed  by  its  trustees in 1981
 despite  protestations  by  several of
 the members. Those who are descendants
 of John.T.Lockey, a  villager who left
 money in his will  for the erection of
 St.Teresa's, are sorry to see it lying
 empty. Caravanners used to swell their
 numbers in summer. Now they worship at
 Aiskew or elsewhere. Soon the building
 will be demolished by a new owner.    </content>
