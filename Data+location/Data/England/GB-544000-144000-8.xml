		<title>08HANDS OFF OUR HOSPITAL!</title>
		<content>    In early 1985 the local hospital   
 (built in 1935) in Edenbridge was     
 threatened with closure due to its    
 size and supposed uneconomic running  
 costs, some of which, however, had    
 always been met by a charitable group,
 The League of Friends. Local residents
 were faced with having to travel the  
 twelve miles to Tunbridge Wells for   
 hospital care.                        
    A meeting was held in February     
 where The Tunbridge Wells Health      
 Authority was questioned. Public      
 support was so in favour of the       
 hospital remaining open that it was   
 agreed it would continue providing top
 line surgery provided consultants were
 prepared to travel to Edenbridge and  
 local doctors would provide the       
 necessary anaesthetics....by Clare
