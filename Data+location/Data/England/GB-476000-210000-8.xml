Dinton Hall is a Georgian stately home.
It is obvious that it has been added to
in more recent years i.e.Victorian     
times,by the way the bricks differ in  
colour from left to right.             
In the 1700s the grounds of the Hall   
consisted of the Hall's gardens, Dinton
village and a few surrounding farms.   
Today the present owners (the Curry    
family) own a few fields and the Hall  
and gardens.                           
The main building materials are red    
brick, slate and stone. There are 26   
chimneys and 88 windows. The Hall is   
not open to the public, but is home of 
one of the largest village fetes in the
country, Dinton Fete which is held once
a year.
