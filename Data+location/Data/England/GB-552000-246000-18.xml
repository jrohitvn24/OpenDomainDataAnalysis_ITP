		<content> On Saturday at 7.40 I woke to the     
 birds calling. On listening more care-
 fully I could also hear the busy A604.
 At 8.00 I made my bed, dressed and    
 went down for my breakfast (bacon,    
 fried potatoes, brown bread &amp; a cup of
 tea). At 9.l5 I washed. In summer our 
 water is heated by electricity but in 
 winter this is supplied by our fire. I
 cleaned my teeth and helped clear the 
 breakfast away. At 10.10 we went shop-
 ping. We have the smallest car in     
 Britain, a Fiat 126. We went to the   
 Grafton Centre, the City Centre,Sains-
 bury's, then home and I played with my
 remote controlled car. Later we went  
 to the local fair. At 5.00 I went home
 and played a board game. Then we had  
 tea (chicken nuggets, chips and home  
 made eclairs). In the evening we      
 walked round Wandlebury Ring (on the  
 Gog Magog hills) and had a barbecue.  </content>
