		<content> A day in the life of Lisa Hassell aged
 11.                                   
                                       
 I get up at 6.00p.m. when the alarm   
 rings, wash, feed Trixie the dog and  
 then get my breakfast ready,(bacon and
 egg with toast and a cup of tea).     
 After I have washed up I take the dog 
 for a walk and then get ready for     
 school.After I have wound up my alarm 
 clock I read until 8.40a.m. when I say
 goodbye to Mum and bike the 2 miles to
 school with my brother. We play a bit 
 and then go in for register and       
 assembly. We work at things like      
 Mathematics,English and Science until 
 break at 10.30a.m. After break we     
 might do music or write a story and   
 then at 12noon we have our lunch,     
 followed by another play and then we  
 will probably do games or P.E. and    
 finish school with reading and story. </content>
