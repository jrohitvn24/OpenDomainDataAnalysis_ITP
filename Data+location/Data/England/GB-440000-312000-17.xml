		<content>   My Dad went down{Snibstone Pit}when 
 he was 15 years old. He made sure that
 the empty tubs at the pit bottom were 
 filled again. They worked 7\ hours a  
 day on each shift and battled to see  
 who could turn out most coal, often   
 1,000 tubs per shift. After 6 months  
 my Dad started{pony driving,}pulling  
 equipment to the coal faces. It was 1\
 miles to reach their place of work.   
 The ponies were worked very hard all  
 day for a bag of oats. My Dad used to 
 take a bag of grass and an apple for  
 his pony. My Dad used to do about five
 runs a day. Silver was exhausted at   
 the end of the shift, and so was my   
 Dad. The ponies were allowed up on the
 surface for two weeks when the pit    
 closed each August. They went down to 
 Snibston Grange to enjoy a well earned
 rest. The ponies had their eyes       
 covered until they got used to the sun</content>
