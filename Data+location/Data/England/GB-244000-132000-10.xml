		<title>10Roger Harding's Visit</title>
		<content> Roger Harding works for Education     
 Department of Braunton Nature         
 Conservation. He did organise men to  
 repair the dry stone walls, stiles and
 linhays but now gives nature talks to 
 schools. He is very concerned about   
{sand erosion}and a great deal of his  
 spare time is taken up planting new   
 stretches of marram grass which binds 
 the sand together.                    
   On our first trip to the{Marshes}Mr 
 Harding showed us the course of the{  
 River Caen which was diverted when{   
{Horsey Ridge}was being built. The old 
 river is clearly marked by rushes     
 and reeds.It costs 25 pence toll to go
 as far as{Crow Point }car park.From   
 there we walked on the boardwalk      
 towards the {Estuary.}
