		<title>19HOME LIFE ST LEONARDS</title>
		<content> I am Matthew and I live in{St Leonards
 which is about 3 miles from Ringwood  
 and 5 from{Ferndown.}In the village   
 are three shops, a park, the Parish   
 Church and a hut for Cubs, Scouts,    
 Brownies and Guides. They go to Church
 Parade once a month. There is a tennis
 club and you need to be a member to   
 play on the courts. My Dad is one of  
 the men who helped build, and who now 
 maintain, the play park. This is next 
 to the recreation ground where I      
 (Glen) train for running and football.
 There are two football pitches and a  
 Bowling Club. There is a steep hill   
 nearby where we go to sledge and ride 
 our bikes. There is a tree stump at   
 the bottom of the hill which is why we
 call it "Devil's Hill". There are     
 several new housing estates in{       
{St Leonards}which have been built on  
 what used to be farmland.             </content>
