 Mr Boffey has all the best {farming   
 machinary for cultivating cereals (all
 very expensive to buy, but all very   
 essential{daily work}.) He ploughs in 
 the Autumn using broad tyres on his   
 tractor so he does not get stuck in   
 muddy ground.In Spring there is more  
 ploughing.He grows only Wheat and     
 Barley. Thoughout the Spring and      
 Summer he watchs his crops,{spraying} 
 with fertilizer, weedkiller and       
 pesticides when needed.He always      
 drives up the same tracks but uses    
 narrower tyres as the ground dries.   
 When the cereals are ripe Mr Boffey   
 and his worker harvest them with a    
{combine-harvester}. Then they take    
 the grain to the drying machine in the
 barn and pass it throughto dry it.It  
 is then stored in huge bins until     
 sold.                                 </content>
