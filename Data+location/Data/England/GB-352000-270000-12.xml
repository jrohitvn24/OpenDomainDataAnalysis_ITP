		<content> school building as their classroom,   
 while the 16 Infants use a demountable
 building.6 children attend school on a
 part-time basis-one day a week-until  
 they are 4yrs.8mths. old,when they    
 begin schooling full-time.The school  
 has a school house attached which is  
 at present empty.In the past the      
 Headteacher,and later the caretaker,  
 occupied this house.There is a small  
 playground and garden which the school
 children use at playtime.The climbing 
 frame and slide are popular with all  
 ages of children,while the sand pit is
 a favourite during the summer.Hanging 
 on the school wall in the playground  
 is the original school bell,which used
 to be housed in the bell tower.The    
 bell is not used to-day very often.
