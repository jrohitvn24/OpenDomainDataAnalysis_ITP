		<title>12Trade; Shopping in Nailsea</title>
		<content> The old{High Street}in Nailsea, which 
 developed close to the old glass      
 workers' cottages (which ceased to    
 exist many years ago) used to be the  
 main shopping centre until the mid    
 1950s. Since then the purpose-built   
 pedestrian{shopping centre}with its   
 supermarkets, shops, banks, offices,  
 library and clinic has become the     
 "heart" of Nailsea as far as trade is 
 concerned. The very wide pedestrian   
 area of Somerset Square sometimes     
 serves as a place of outdoor          
 entertainment with local school music 
 groups or other organisations playing 
 to passers-by. Three large car parks  
 serve the centre. These have{free     
{parking}for customers' cars; an       
 attraction not to be found in Bristol!
 However, many Nailsea people regularly
 travel to Weston-super-mare or to N.W.
 Bristol to shop at the{Hypermarkets.  </content>
