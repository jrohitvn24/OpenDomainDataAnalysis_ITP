		<title>02MARCHON CHEMICAL WORKS</title>
		<content> Marchon chemical works exists on the  
 site of the old Ladysmith Pit coke    
 ovens at Kells.The company moved here 
 in 1943 and in the early days made    
 firelighters,toiletries and shampoo   
 preparations.The company then expanded
 to make detergents and sulphuric      
 acid.By co-incidence sulphuric acid   
 can be made from anhydrite,and large  
 deposits of anhydrite ,known to exist 
 underneath the works site,were        
 mined.New technology in the production
 of phosphoric acid and chemicals for  
 detergent making meant more imports of
 phosphate rock from Casablanca,which  
 enters Whitehaven via its harbour.    
   The works now dominate the skyline  
 at Kells with its large towers and    
 chimneys.Local residents complain     
 about the smells and dust.The works is
 a major employer in the town and is   
 part of the Albright &amp; Wilson group.  </content>
