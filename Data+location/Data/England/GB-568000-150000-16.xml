 Although Nettlestead has only a       
 Cricket Club the village is adjacent  
 to Wateringbury and villagers         
 participate there. In Yalding clubs   
 cater for many interests, including   
 football, cricket, karate and squash. 
 There is a mother and baby club,      
 Women's Institute, Bingo Club and a   
 Working Men's Club. The Primrose Club 
 organises functions for older people. 
 The Garden Society holds 3 shows each 
 year. There is a Youth Club as well as
 Cubs, Brownies, Scouts and Guides.    
 Church groups include Mothers' Union, 
 bellringers and choir. The Weald      
 Playgroup caters for pre-school age   
 children. The local environmental     
 group, Yalding &amp; Nettlestead          
 Protection Society, has kept open     
 footpaths and planted trees. There is 
 some angling. Videos may be hired.    </content>
