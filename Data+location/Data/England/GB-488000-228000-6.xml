		<title>06Critchley's fruit farm.</title>
		<content> Critchleys self-pick fruit farm has   
 been open for 10 years whilst the     
 owners have lived there for 20        
 years.It is their living. They have   
 100 acers of fields half of which are 
 fruit and half are corn.They do not   
 keep the crops in                     
 the same place because they have a    
 rotation every 3 years.The farm does  
 not make alot of profit because they  
 had a terrible June in 1985.They have 
 only one employee.The seeds they get  
 themselves from other                 
 Manufacturers.The farm has cut down on
 sprays because of the cost.But they   
 still keep strawberries the same price
 35p-1b. The farm is cutting down      
 every month and every year which means
 eventually they will have to close    
 altogether because of the lack of     
 profits in self pick fruit farms.
