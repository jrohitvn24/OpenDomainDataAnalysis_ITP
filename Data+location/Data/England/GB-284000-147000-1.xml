		<title>01North Exmoor to Porlock Weir</title>
		<content> This block forms part of the Northern 
 edge of the Exmoor National Park, so  
 popular with walkers. Its highest     
 point (350 metres above sea level) is 
 the South West corner. The moorland   
 falls away steeply to the North and   
 East, firstly to deciduous woodland   
 and then to cultivated grassland. In  
 the East are salt marshes behind the  
 shore which along this coast is of    
 stone and large boulders. The area is 
 sparsely populated. Most people live  
 in the village of Porlock Weir, which 
 has an hotel, an inn, one cafe, three 
 shops, a chapel, small tidal harbour  
 and some pretty cottage many with     
 thatched rooves. At the West end of   
 the block, in the woods, is Culbone   
 Church. The village has one public    
 road from the East with a bus service 
 to Minehead. From the West is a toll  
 road down a steep hill through woods. </content>
