		<content> Most of the working population travel 
 to their places of work.These are     
 primarily in the larger towns such as 
 Whitehaven which has a relatively     
 large chemical works called Marchon.  
 The town is also the main shopping and
 services centre for the area and      
 therefore attracts most of the        
 associated labour.                    
 Apart from farming therefore the only 
 businesses are those who are self     
 employed and work from their home     
 address.Examples of this sort being a 
 joiner,an architect and a surveyor.   
 The largest single employer in this   
 part of the county is the nuclear     
 power station at Sellafield.A good    
 many of the residents commute each day
 to the complex and are employed either
 by B.N.F.L. or one of the many sub    
 contractors working on site.
