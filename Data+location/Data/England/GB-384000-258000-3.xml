		<content> Church of England at Martin           
 Hussingtree. Thought to have been     
 built by the Pyrie family in the 12th 
 C. Restored in the 17th C, added to in
 the 19th C. Built of sandstone, it has
 a small wooden steeple and            
 half-timbered entrance porch. There   
 are two bells which summon the 40     
 strong congregation to services. Rev. 
 Willis has the united benefice of     
 Martin Hussingtree, Salwarpe and      
 Hindlip. Inside are memorial plaques  
 on white painted walls. The ceiling is
 panelled wood and from it hangs a cast
 iron chandelier. Stained glass in     
 memory of hunting field master (dec'd 
 1898). Peter Walker, MP, Secretary of 
 State for Energy and MP for           
 Worcester used to live nearby and     
 worshipped at the Church.
