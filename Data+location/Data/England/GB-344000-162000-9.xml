		<content> IN THE AREA AROUND WOOLMERS AND IN    
 CORPORATION WOODS SEVERAL INTERESTING 
 THINGS CAN BE SEEN. THERE IS A FENCED 
 OFF AREA USED TO REAR PHEASANTS BEFORE
 THEY ARE RELEASED. THE CORN FED TO    
 THEM HAS IN SEVERAL PLACES SPROUTED.  
 THERE ARE TWO WELLS, STILL FULL OF    
 WATER, TAKING THEIR WATER FROM NATURAL
 SPRINGS. ONE OF THEM IS STILL IN USE  
 AND HAS A TAP.                        
 THERE ARE SEVERAL APPARENTLY DERELICT 
 SHEDS CONTAINING OLD PLOUGHS AND OTHER
 FARM IMPLEMENTS. BESIDE THE KENNELS AT
 WOOLMERS IS AN AREA OF HARDSTANDING   
 WITH SEVERAL TRAILERS AND WAGONS. THE 
 MOST INTERESTING FIND OF ALL IS A     
 STEAM ROAD ROLLER. THIS STILL APPEARS 
 TO BE IN USE; AS THERE ARE SOME       
 CIRCULAR SAWS NEARBY WITH NO OTHER    
 SOURCE OF POWER IT MAY BE THAT THE    
 ENGINE IS USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.
