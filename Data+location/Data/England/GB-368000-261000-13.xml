		<content> In Clifton, we have a police house    
 where a{policeman}lives. He is not    
 really the village policeman because  
 he is often on duty in other places   
 like Stourport. Our policeman is kind 
 and happy and is also the group scout 
 master. his duty in our village is    
 shared with the Martley and Great     
 Witley policeman. The police check the
 childrens'{cycles}and make sure that  
 we play in safe places. We do not have
 much{theft}in the area although our   
 school computer was stolen last year. 
 There has been trouble with{poachers  
 near the Shelsleys and also some cases
 of{dogs killing lambs.}The worst      
{accidents}happen on Clifton Hill when 
 cars go too fast or skid on the ice in
 winter. There is a{speed limit}of 30  
 mph in Clifton and there is a problem 
 with cars{parking}on the main street.
