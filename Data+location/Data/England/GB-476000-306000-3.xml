{   ____________________________       
  Owston woods are young woods on the  
 site of ancient forest mostly on clay,
 which was clear felled. Big Wood, to  
 the west, is managed by the Forestry  
 Commission who permit access to the   
 central rides. The rides, used        
 regularly by the Cottesmore Hunt,     
 easily become water_logged which      
 encourages the growth of marsh plants.
 The flora is very rich including four 
 species of orchid, herb paris,        
 helleborine, bluebell and primrose,   
 while the fauna includes muntjac deer,
 dormouse, badger and fox. Birds       
 include the nightingale, great spotted
 woodpecker and summer migrants who    
 breed.                                
 Knossington lakes are a fishing       
 amenity visited by geese and ducks in 
 winter.                               </content>
