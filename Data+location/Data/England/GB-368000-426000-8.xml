		<content>  {Seaton Court,}just off Fishmoor     
 Drive, is an old people's home. It is 
 quite a large building that occupies  
 thirty-seven people.                  
   The age range that is accepted is   
 from 65 to 90 years old. They live    
 there for the rest of their lives and 
 if they are too ill they go to a      
 nursing-home.                         
   In the morning, the warden calls    
 everyone on the intercom,and goes     
 round to check that everyone is well. 
   To occupy themselves the old people 
 go out shopping, clean themselves or  
 look after the house. They go out for 
 outings twice a year and ten concerts 
 are held in a year.                   
   The old people are kept very warm   
 and comfortable because of the helpful
 staff. If we were old we would like to
 spend the rest of our lives there.
