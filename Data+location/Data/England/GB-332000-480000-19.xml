		<content>   The few people that live in this    
 area regard it very highly for its    
 peace and relative isolation.Many of  
 them have lived here all their lives  
 and their families go back several    
 generations in the area.Inspite of the
 total lack of services few would      
 consider moving away.                 
   The lack of a bus service or other  
 forms of public transport is not      
 important to most.Private transport is
 an accepted essential part of life so 
 that inhabitants can use the sevices  
 of the nearby settlements.The nearest 
 primary school is a few kilometres    
 away at Flookburgh and Ulverston      
 Market is important to the local      
 growers and farmers.                  
   The area has changed only slowly    
 over the years and this is a situation
 that local people hope will continue  
 into the future.                      </content>
