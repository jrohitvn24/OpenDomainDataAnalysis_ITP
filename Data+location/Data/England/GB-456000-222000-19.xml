		<title>19ATTITUDES IN BICESTER</title>
		<content>The inhabitants of Bicester are happy  
with the shopping facilities available,
although more clothing shops are       
needed. The general consensus is that  
the too many pubs and not enough coffee
bars etc. for young people to meet.    
A theatre and a cinema were also       
suggested as necessary entertainment.  
The old cinema was converted into a    
Bingo Hall some years ago.             
Some of the roads need widening,e.g.   
The Causway, which is a bottleneck for 
traffic.A passenger train link with    
Oxford is needed too.                  
many arteas are difficult for the      
disabled to gain access to,e.g. the    
steps at the Post Office. A large      
number of pavements are too narrow to  
accommodate a wheelchair easily.
