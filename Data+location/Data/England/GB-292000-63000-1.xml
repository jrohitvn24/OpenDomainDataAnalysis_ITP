		<title>01Torquay and the Torbay Area</title>
		<content>      The building of The Great Western
 Railway and its extension to South    
 Devon heralded the era of long        
 distance travel for large numbers of  
 the population.From the time of the   
 completion of the line to Torquay and 
 its extension to Paignton,Churston and
 Kingswear in 1861,the popularity of   
 the area as a holiday centre grew     
 rapidly.                              
         In the space of a few years   
 the bay was transformed.Torquay       
 expanded from a small town with a few 
 hotels and a small harbour into one of
 the most successful resorts in England
 boasting some of the finest hotels.The
 need for more modest accommodation    
 created the almost continuous band of 
 guest houses stretching to beyond     
 Goodrington and the expansion of      
 Brixham from a fishing village into a 
 crowded town.                         </content>
