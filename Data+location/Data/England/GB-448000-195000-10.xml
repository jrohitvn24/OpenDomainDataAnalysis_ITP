		<title>10CHILDRENS GAMES IN ABINGDON</title>
		<content>Your opponent lays their marble or     
marbles on the ground,then you lay your
marble on yhe ground.The person whose  
marble is nearest to the pot,which is  
usually a rough hole in the ground,goes
first.Then you hit the marble with the 
side of your first finger,aiming for   
the pot.If you get your marble in the  
pot first you then try to hit your     
opponents marble in to the pot.The     
first person to do this is the winner  
and they win their opponents marble.

             SKIPPING                  
Skip,skip as I play skipping in the    
playground.Here is one of the rhymes we
sing."Mother in the kitchen,doing a bit
of stitching,in comes the Bogey man and
out she ran."                          
We also play Blocky which is a chasing 
game.
