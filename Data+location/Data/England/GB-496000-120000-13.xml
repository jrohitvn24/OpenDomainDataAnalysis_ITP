		<title>13Petworth Visitors Recall War</title>
		<content> During the War the Canadians were     
 situated at Pheasant Copse in Petworth
 Park. They were not allowed to keep a 
 diary or log book because if the      
 Germans found it they would know what 
 the Canadians were planning. They got 
 back to Canada in 1944. We asked one  
 of the Canadians what his most        
 important medal was. He said that it  
 was his Silver Jubilee. They said all 
 that was different about Petworth was 
 the new houses. From Canada to England
 it took them about six and a half     
 hours. One of the Canadians said that 
 Toronto is very like London, very     
 crowded and everone very busy. They   
 left Petworth to go back to London at 
 5.30 p.m.                             
 On the 1st May they go on to the VE   
 pilgrimage in Holland.
