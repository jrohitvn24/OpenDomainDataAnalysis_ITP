		<title>10FARMING IN OFFLEY</title>
		<content>   The farm land in Offley is owned by 
 three landlords; 66% by Sir Thomas    
 Pilkington, 25% by the Crown and 8% by
 Mr Parrish.                           
   The land is mostly used for arable  
 crops - wheat, barley and  rape.      
 Hoo Farm is the largest farm, with    
 3,000 acres. It is the Home Farm of   
 the Pilkington estate and is run by   
 an estate manager and five other men. 
 It is totally arable land except that 
 some hay is grown to support a flock  
 of sheep.                             
   The only farm which has a dairy herd
 is Glebe Farm which is worked by a    
 tenant farmer and one farm worker.    
  Dog Kennel Farm is worked by a tenant
 farmer and his son, who breed and     
 train race-horses as well as grow     
 arable crops.                         
   The rest of the five farms are all  
 run by tenant farmers and their sons. </content>
