		<title>09Attitudes - Cronton Village</title>
		<content> Attitudes,Rural Environment;Most are  
 happy with its rural environment and  
 its close proximity and reasonable    
 access to major towns and cities in   
 the area. Facilities; The lack of     
 facilities in the village is          
 compensated by those found outside.   
 County Boundaries; Concern was        
 expressed when these were rearranged  
 but now most people accept being part 
 of the Met.Boro. of Knowsley. It is   
 their Ed. Com. that is responsible for
 both aided primary schools and        
 although it also provides secondary   
 places for these children, most are   
 accommodated in Widnes (Cheshire).    
 The movement across boundaries is only
 restricted by lack of places in the   
 chosen secondary schools. Green belt; 
 Cronton is situated within a green    
 belt area and people would prefer this
 to remain intact.                     </content>
