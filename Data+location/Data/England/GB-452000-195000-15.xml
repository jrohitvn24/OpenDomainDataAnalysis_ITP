		<title>15VILLAGE CONCERNS</title>
		<content>   The villagers at first found the JET
 project  alarming:  the  size  of  the
 building  appeared a blot on the land-
 scape  and  the  blue  colour  did not
 blend into the countryside. Since then
 however, the villagers  have seen that
 there  are  some  advantages  such  as
 raising  the  value  of  property  and
 lowering rates.                       
                                       
   Concern  about traffic problems has,
 nevertheless, remained.  When JET  was
 first established there were tailbacks
 to the  village  until  sliproads were
 built.  As it lies on the direct route
 from  Didcot  to  Cowley,  traffic    
 continues to be far too  heavy for a B
 road.  Rumours that Didcot industry is
 to  expand  make  the inhabitants fear
 that  the  problem  will  become  even
 worse.                                
                                       </content>
