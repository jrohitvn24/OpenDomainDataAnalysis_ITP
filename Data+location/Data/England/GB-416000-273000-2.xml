		<title>02Middlefield Hospital</title>
		<content> Middlefield is a{hospital}for mentally
 handicapped people operating within   
 the National{Health}Service .There are
 165 patients who are from all parts of
 the country-only 4 are local people.  
 Each resident is recommended for      
 admission in the first place by the   
 family doctor.                        
 Entries have now ceased and the       
 hospital is due for closure in about  
 15 years.It is hoped that patients    
 will be trained to take their place in
 the community and flats are being     
 built to cater for them.Many{patients 
 have spent most of their lives there  
 (the longest resident having been     
 there for 62 years) and will require  
 extensive training to be able to      
 return to society.
