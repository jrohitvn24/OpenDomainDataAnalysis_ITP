		<content>  Most houses are built of Cotswold    
 stone, a few have thatched roofs.     
 Others have slate roofs. A few are    
 built of brick. They have main        
 services of electricity, piped water  
 and sewage disposal. There is no mains
 gas supply so solid fuel, Calor Gas or
 electricity are used for cooking and  
 heating. Most households have a       
 refrigerator and/or a freezer.        
  Milk and bread are delivered, but    
 other groceries have to be bought in  
 Oxford or Kidlington.                 
  In Woodeaton most houses are owned by
 Christchurch College and are rented.  
  In Elsfield many houses are also     
 owned by Christchurch College and are 
 let to tenants. Elsfield Manor House  
 is divided into flats.                
  Some houses date from the 17th       
 Century. A few of the cottages are    
 tied to local farms.                  </content>
