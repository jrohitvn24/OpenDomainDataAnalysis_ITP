		<content> Down our school lane there are a lot  
 of wild animals like hares and        
 hedgehogs. Our teacher said that there
 were some badgers down the line and   
 when we went for a walk we saw a      
 badger's footprints. I walked down the
 lane a bit more and I came to a place 
 where the hedge had been flattened    
 down by something. I said it could be 
 a badger's path to its set. We        
 carried on and came to our den. It    
 used to be a ditch but no water       
 flows through it. We carried on       
 walking and came to the motorway.     
 The motorway is good in a way         
 because all the trucks go on it. If   
 you go under the bridge you come to   
 the quarry. When it has been raining  
 you can sometimes see where a rabbit  
 has been under the bridge because you 
 can see its footprints. On the way    
 back we saw some crows in their nests.</content>
