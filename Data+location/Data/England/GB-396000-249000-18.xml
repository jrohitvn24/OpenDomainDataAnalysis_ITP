		<content> Teenagers thoughts of her confirmation
   "I had been looking forward to my   
 confirmation for weeks, the classes   
 I'd attended taught me about the step 
 which I was about to take and made me 
 realise how little I knew about God.  
   On the morning of 24th February 1985
 I received gifts to remind me of my   
 confirmation. My Godparents, my family
 and I then went to Naunton Beauchamp  
 church where the ceremony was to be   
 performed by the Bishop of Dudley. I  
 knelt down before the Bishop, and my  
 mum, who was my sponsor, placed her   
 hand on my right shoulder. The Bishop 
 put his hand on my head and confirmed 
 me. All the candidates then took Holy 
 Communion for the first time.         
   Afterwards the Bishop presented us  
 each with an Alternative Services book
 and talked to us and our families over
 coffee and biscuits."                 </content>
