		<title>11Local history of Stratton</title>
		<content> Stone and field monuments are to be   
 seen. Traces of Iron Age fields and   
 settlement enclosures are at          
 Grimstone Down.  A dry summer reveals 
 the route of the Roman road crossing  
 the valley, thus the name of          
 Stratton.The Roman aqueduct, most     
 visible at the bend above Bradford    
 Peverell church, was a leat carrying  
 millions of gallons a day to          
 Dorchester. The watermeadows were     
 constructed in the late 18th century  
 to obtain early grass by daily        
 flooding of the valley floor. The     
 Doles, still bounded by hedges, are a 
 remnant of the strip farming system of
 the middle ages.Jackman's Cross is    
 reputedly the site of a hanging for   
 sheep stealing.  An 18th century sheep
 dip is at the bottom of Mill Lane,    
 which leads to the mill. The wheel is 
 still present, but not operating.     </content>
