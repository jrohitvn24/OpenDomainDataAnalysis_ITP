		<title>12THE CARAVAN SITE</title>
		<content> Grange Caravan Park is near the Solent
 Industrial Estate,Hedge End.Before    
 1967 when it was built, it was open   
 fields and a military camp.Now it     
 consists of 154 permanent caravans    
 each with a garden.In the centre of   
 the site is an open area for tourist  
 caravans and also a shop.             
 Caravans get their electricity and    
 water the same way as a house, but the
 gas comes from bottles.Some people    
 live there because they cannot afford 
 anything else and others because they 
 enjoy it.It is easier for older and   
 disabled people because there are no  
 steps or stairs.It is especially good 
 for old people because there is less  
 to dust and clean.The good thing is   
 you can stay in the site as long as   
 you like unless it closes down.
