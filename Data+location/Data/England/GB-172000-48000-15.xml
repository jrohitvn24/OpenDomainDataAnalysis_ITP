		<title>15St. Agnes: Cornish language</title>
		<content> The Cornish language is no longer     
 confined to snatches of dialect, and  
 place names.  Today there are more    
 people with a knowledge of the        
 language who can read, write and speak
 it than at any time during the past   
 250 years.  A language revival was    
 begun by some Cornish scholars at the 
 beginning of this century.  The       
 language is continuing today with a   
 fair degree of success.  But outside  
 Cornwall it is not generally known    
 that there IS a Cornish language.     
 Instead there remain vague folk       
 memories of the "differentness" of the
 Cornish people.  Cornish is one of six
 Celtic languages that survive today.  
 The Tonkin family of Trevaunance used 
 as their motto "Kenz of tra, Tonkin   
 ouna Dev Mahtern yn" - "Tonkin, above 
 all things, Fear God and the King."   
 This was known as Middle Cornish.     </content>
