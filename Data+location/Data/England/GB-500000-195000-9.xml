		<content>Chorleywood House was built in 1895 by 
Lady Ella Russell. She built it after  
her husband's death. The house is off  
the A404, at the end of a long drive.  
Lady Ella Russell founded the Working  
Mens Club and a Rifle Club. Both clubs 
met at Chorleywood House. Later on she 
became the President of the Women's    
Institute which was her main interest  
till her death in 1936. She employed   
lots of gardeners to keep the large    
grounds neat and pretty. She would     
often invite guests for tea and show   
off her beautiful gardens. She used to 
tour the grounds in a small electric   
carriage. Many festivals and parties   
were held at the house. On the 12th    
May 1937 coronation celebrations       
took place with sports events,fireworks
and the King's speech broadcast by     
loudspeakers. Today the house is the   
offices of the local council.          </content>
