		<title>18Playground Game -Football</title>
		<content>Football is a game played by 6 but in  
professional football there are 11     
players.You have two posts at each end 
and there is a goalkeeper.He tries to  
save the goals.The players tackle.     
There is a ball. You have to try to    
get the ball off the other team's      
players.Then you run with the ball     
trying to get past the other team with 
the ball and try to score.You must not 
pick the ball up but the goalkeeper    
can.If you hurt somebody it is a       
freekick but if it is near the goal it 
is a penalty.If you handle the  ball   
it is a freekick and if it is near the 
goal it is a penalty.To score a goal   
you kick the ball and you hope it will 
go in the goal without the goalkeeper  
stopping it.Our school team  went to   
Wattisfield .We played against many    
other schools.We came second in the    
small schools section.                 </content>
