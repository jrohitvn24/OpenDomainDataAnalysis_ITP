		<title>15A Day In The Life of Alan.</title>
		<content> Alan Burgess,aged 11 years.           
   In the morning I wake up at about   
 7.00am,I get dressed,have a wash and  
 brush my teeth with Colgate blue minty
 gel toothpaste.My favourite items of  
 clothing are my grey trousers,white   
 sweatshirt  and white Nicks trainers. 
 For breakfast I usually have Kelloggs 
 cornflakes or bacon sandwiches        
 (butties).I get to school by a bus    
 organized by some of the parents.     
   During lunch time I am a server,    
 which means I am responsible for      
 setting the table for dinner and      
 giving the dinner out.I play football 
 and do high jump at dinner times.At   
 about 3.35pm we line up and get on the
 bus to go home.                       
   For tea we have sandwiches and a    
 yogurt.At night I either play with my 
 games or watch television.Bedtime is  
 9.00pm.                               </content>
