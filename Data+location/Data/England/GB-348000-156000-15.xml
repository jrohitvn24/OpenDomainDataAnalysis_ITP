		<title>15BLAGDON SCHOOL ACTIVITIES.</title>
		<content>  When I changed schools about six     
 months ago, I saw a large difference  
 from the other school where I had been
 for about seven years. This school is 
 much{less strict}than my old one, and 
 the teachers are more{friendly.}At my 
 former school I was doing more, much  
 harder, (and more{boring work).}At the
 other school we might have been set   
 ten fraction multiplication sums to do
 in about five minutes, or three long  
 division sums in five minutes. Whereas
 at this school we are either given    
 different,or more interesting work,   
 with more time to develop &amp; enjoy it. 
  It wasn't a happy school,as I felt   
 that the teachers only cared about our
 work. I think my new one cares about  
 us as well. Also too much emphasis was
 put on doing well. Here it's not. At  
 times here there isn't enough forcing 
 of rules. But I prefer this school.   </content>
