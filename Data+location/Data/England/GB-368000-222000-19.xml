		<title>19THE FALCONRY CENTRE-NEWENT</title>
		<content>  The{Birds of Prey Conservation and   
{Falconry Centre,}was opened at        
{Cliffords Mesne}in 1967 by Philp      
 Glasier, the Falconer.                
  The centre now leads the world in the
 captive breeding of the{Raptors (Birds
{of Prey>}and has recently embarked on 
 a programme of releasing birds to the 
 wild- notably the{Barn Owl.}Pairs of  
 birds of endagered species are also   
 sent to the centre from all over the  
 world and when a successful breeding  
 programme is established the off-     
 spring are again returned to their    
 place of origin.                      
  Some{45000 visitors}a year are able  
 to see Owls,Falcons,Eagles,Buzzards,  
 Kites and Vultures to name but a few. 
  There is also a museum with exhibits 
 and photographs  but the highlight of 
 any visit must be the free-flying     
 demonstrations by the birds of prey.  </content>
