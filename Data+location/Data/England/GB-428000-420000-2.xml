 The Village has been raising money for
 a new Village Hall for 7 years.The    
 cost of the new Village Hall is       
 Â£66,000.At the moment the community   
 have raised around Â£25,000.The council
 have decided to pay 25 percent of the 
 money.The Village Hall was demolished 
 because it was dangerous.At one of the
 dances one of the walls moved 6       
 inches.Mike Joyce the chairman of     
 the community is hoping that they can 
 get the new Village Hall built and    
 opened by September.Underneath the    
 site for the new Village Hall there   
 was an area of clay which is thought  
 to have been the remains of the mining
 operations which were carried out in  
 the last century.
