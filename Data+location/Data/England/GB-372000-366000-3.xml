		<content>       Most of the housing is in the   
 east of the area on the edge of the   
 village of Holmes Chapel. Here the    
 houses have been built over the last  
 twenty years. They range from detached
 and semi-datached houses and bungalows
 to a mews of private flats.           
         The rest of the housing is    
 much older than the estates and is    
 scattered over the area. There is a   
 mixture of farm houses and buildings, 
 the one opposite our school is over   
 350 years old, cottages and terraced  
 houses. Most of these have been built 
 during the last 100 years.            
         As well as the houses there   
  is                                   
 also Cranage Hall Hospital, which has 
 homes in its grounds for the hospital 
 workers. The oldest building in the   
 grounds is the Hall itself which is   
 around 200 years old. cont'd on p.4.  </content>
