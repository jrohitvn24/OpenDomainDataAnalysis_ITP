		<content>{ Dickinsons Garage -WINSFORD.         
 Although the business was founded in  
 1919 by the great grandfather of the  
 present owner,  it has been housed in 
 the present building since 1962.      
  The garage offers a wide range of    
 services including car repairs,new and
 used car sales, vehicle hire, parts   
 and accessory sales and petrol sales. 
  Customers are attracted from a wide  
 area of Mid-Cheshire for vehicle sales
 and hire, although the sale of fuel   
 largely depends on regular local      
 customers. The average amount of fuel 
 sold is 8000 litres a week.           
  The garage is run as a family concern
 and employs 26 people, most of whom   
 work in the car repair section. Car   
 sales accounts for approximately 50%  
 of the business and the average       
 turnover is around 30 vehicles per    
 month. Half of these are mostly new.  </content>
