 To the north of Middle Park Way lie   
 the ornamental gardens which include  
 the arboretum. An open area marks the 
 site of the old house, from the       
 terrace the lawn drops down toward the
 lake. to the north and west lie the   
 City nurseries.                       
   South of the road the remainder of  
 the gardens and the farm buildings    
 house the farm trail where rare breeds
 and domestic animals may be seen by
