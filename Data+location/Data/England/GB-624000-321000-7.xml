		<content> There has been a mill at Buxton since 
 before the{Norman Conquest.}It was    
 certainly mentioned in the{Domesday   
{Book.}It ceased to work as a mill     
 in 1970 when it became a{crafts and   
{arts centre.}The present building was 
 built in the 18th century.            
 The main building now houses the      
 following: an Antique department      
 specialising in pine furniture, an    
 artist/designer's workshop, a model   
 maker's workshop, spinning and        
 weaving, picture framing, a general   
 craft area and an upholstery and      
 furniture company.                    
 Also on the site there is a{Freehouse 
{and Restaurant.                       
 Attached to the main building, in what
 was the mill office, is a small{hotel 
 whose bedrooms provide superb views of
 the River Bure and mill_stream.       
 The mill is well known.               </content>
