		<title>01OUR BLOCK</title>
		<content> WE HAVE DRIVEN AROUND OUR BLOCK IN A  
 MINIBUS AND CARS,WE HAVE ALSO WALKED  
 ALONG ROADS AND FOOTPATHS.THIS IS AN  
 AGRICULTURAL AREA WHICH IS KEPT WELL  
 WATERED BY THE RIVER STOUR WHICH      
 SOMETIMES FLOODS THE FIELDS AND       
 VILLAGES.THE TWO VILLAGES OF          
 STURMINSTER MARSHALL AND SHAPWICK ARE 
 ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE RIVER.YOU   
 CAN GO FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BY       
 CROSSING WHITE MILL BRIDGE.ALL THE    
 LAND IS FENCED AND IS USED FOR        
 FARMING.THE LARGE MILK FACTORY IN     
 STURMINSTER MARSHALL HAS CLOSED DOWN  
 AND THE BUILDINGS ARE NOW USED BY MANY
 SMALL FIRMS.THIS VILLAGE IS SLOWLY    
 GROWING BIGGER BUT MANY OF THE PEOPLE 
 LIVING HERE DRIVE OUT OF THE AREA TO  
 THEIR WORK.THE SCHOOL CHANGED FROM AN 
 ALL AGE SCHOOL 5-15 TO A PRIMARY 5-11 
 AND IS NOW A FIRST SCHOOL 5-9.
