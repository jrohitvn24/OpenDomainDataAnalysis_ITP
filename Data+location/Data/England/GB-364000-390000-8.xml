		<content> Our school opened in 1981.We only had 
 32 children at first,now we have      
 202 children and ten teachers.Before  
 the school was built there used to be 
 a farm,then in the war there was an   
 ordnance factory.All that is left is  
 the big oak tree in our playground.We 
 have the tree on our school badge. We 
 have seven classes and the children   
 are from 5-11 years old.We have       
 gerbils,hamsters and guinea pigs in   
 school and we help to care for        
 them.The school is open-plan and we   
 have wet areas for painting.Sometimes 
 we go out to visit museums and other  
 interesting places.Some children go   
 on School Venture Holidays.This year  
 28 children went to Burwardsley       
 Outdoor Education Centre for three    
 days.We have a School Bank.We have    
 Football,Netball,Rounders and Cricket 
 teams.                                </content>
