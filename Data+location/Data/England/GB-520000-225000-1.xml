 "The Old and the New" would be a good 
 description  of  this{"D" }block. The{
{Stevenage  High  Street }is  very old 
 whilst the{Stevenage New Town}is very 
 modern.  The  block   includes   two  
 villages, {Little  Wymondley  }and{   
{Graveley.}Little Wymondley has a large
 electricity transformer station whilst
 Graveley  has  a  Citroen car dealer. 
 There is a motorway called the{A1M},as
 well as a  railway  line  which links 
 London  with {Edinburgh. }When  coming
 southwards towards Stevenage on the   
 A1M, one of the first things you see  
 is{Lister Hospital.}In the new part of
 Stevenage is a{shopping centre}and a  
 number of housing estates called      
 neighbourhoods.Most of the new houses 
 in this block are in the Symonds Green
 neighbourhood.There are several farms 
 and a factory making school furniture.</content>
