 by{William I's standard bearer,       
{Gislebert de Tesson.}Mr.Vickers is the
 Duke's present tenant &amp; isn't allowed 
 to buy the farm which is mainly arable
 but he also breeds animals.He has 230 
 ewes,30 cows and 60 calves.Mr Vickers 
 grows linseed,barley,peas,oil seed    
 rape,potatoes,turnips and oats.For the
 arable farming Mr Vickers has 5       
 tractors,1 round bailer and 1 combine 
 harvester.Mr. Vickers{specialises}in  
{turkey farming.}His mother started it 
 all off so he took over.{He kills     
{2-3000 turkeys in one year.}Most of   
 them are killed at{Christmas.}It's not
 very hard to keep turkeys because they
 are kept in one room.There has only   
 been one disaster which was in 1973   
 when a hay shed burnt down.If Mr      
 Vickers was not a farmer he would have
 been an engineer.                     </content>
