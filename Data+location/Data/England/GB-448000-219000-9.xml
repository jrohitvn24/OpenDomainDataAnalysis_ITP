		<title>09Kytes Pond - Kirtlington</title>
		<content>Kytes Pond is almost certainly an "open
pond". The ecology of the pond includes
lots of rapidly growing lilies so it   
has to be cleared every year. There are
also many birds. The Moorhens on the   
pond have produced at least one chick  
every year. Some years ago a Woodcock  
landed on a muddy beach on the pond.   
Some time after that the muddy beach   
was dug away, so it is unlikely to     
happen again. The House Martins used to
build their nests using mud from the   
mud bank, but they have gone away since
the mud bank was dug away. There are   
several Grey Wagtails near the pond.   
Lots of Chiff-Chaffs sing in the trees 
behind the pond. In 1977 when the pond 
was cleared out a Crucian Carp was     
found dead floating on the surface.    
Some people near the pond find newts on
their doorsteps.
