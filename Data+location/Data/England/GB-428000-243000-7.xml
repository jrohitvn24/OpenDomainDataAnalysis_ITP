		<content> The church of St.Lawrence at Oxhill   
 and St. Peters Whatcote are built of  
 the blue and brown Hornton stone with 
 some light Lyas stone.Both have       
 battlemented towers.The view from the 
 towers is extensive with the well     
 wooded Edgehill,Tysoe and Idlicote    
 hills to the east and south and       
 dominated by the crowned Brailes hill.
                                       
 The gently rolling countryside around 
 is a patchwork of fields of green in  
 winter and spring turning to green and
 gold in late summer to be partly      
 obscured by the smoke of stubble fires
 in autumn.Ploughing in autumn then    
 turns the patchwork to green and brown
 with reds and yellows from the trees  
 and hedges.                           
                                       
 Low flying British jet aircraft are   
 frequently seen and heard.            </content>
