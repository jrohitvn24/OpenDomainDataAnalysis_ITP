		<title>10Walmore Common</title>
		<content> In the winter migratory birds arrive  
 such as Bewick's Swans and wild geese 
 as well as gulls.The sound of the     
 swans is as of a large party of people
 all talking together,catching up on   
 each other's news.The flooding comes  
 from the overflow of the River Severn 
 mainly due to prolonged or heavy rain 
 in the Welsh hill catchment area of   
 the Severn.Because of the flooding and
 consequent absence of intensive       
 farming,chemical additives or major   
 disturbance of the habitat over the   
 partly grazed rough pasture,an        
 S.S.S.I.has been designated here.When 
 the floods are up and the water       
 freezes then it is possible to skate  
 on the common as long as the skaters  
 keep away from the dykes where the ice
 is not only weakest but the penalty   
 for falling through could be fatal.   
 Elsewhere the ice lies safely on grass</content>
