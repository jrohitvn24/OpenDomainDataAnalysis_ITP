		<title>17Occupation of Parents-Kirton</title>
		<content> We asked all the children in our      
 school to fill in a questionnaire     
 about the work that their parents do. 
 We found out that 18% of the fathers  
 are unemployed and 50% of mothers go  
 out to work.                          
     26% of fathers and 52% of mothers 
 actually work in or near Kirton, while
 34% of both mothers and fathers work  
 in the local town of Boston.The other 
 parents work elsewhere in the area.   
     About 15% of fathers and 26% of   
 mothers work on or actually run farms.
 About 12% of fathers are lorry drivers
 and a few people are employed in      
 packing vegetables.About 7% of fathers
 are professional people - a soliciter,
 doctors, nurses , a policeman and     
 several teachers.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
