		<content>  Children sometimes collect and       
 play games with beermats. Beermats are
 pieces of card cut into different     
 shapes and sizes.You find them in     
 Public Houses where they are used for 
 putting drinks on.They are decorated  
 with words and pictures.              
   Some children have quite a lot of   
 mats.When they want to have a game    
 they find a wall to play against.They 
 lean two cards against the wall and   
 then throw more beermats, trying to   
 knock down one of the cards tilted    
 against the wall.                     
  The winner is the first one to knock 
 down a card.The winner keeps all the  
 cards thrown during the game.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
