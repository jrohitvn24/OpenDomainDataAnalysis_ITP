		<title>02HOUSING BRAISHFIELD</title>
		<content> Braishfield could best be described as
 a dormitory village, with a population
 of approximately 600, almost one third
 of whom are of pensionable age. The   
 residential properties are a mixture  
 of council housing, including 9 O.A.P.
 bungalows, old cottages, many of which
 have been restored to modern standards
 and large modern detached houses owned
 mostly by executives. The main        
 improvement of recent times is the    
 completion in 1985 of a main sewerage 
 scheme for the whole village.         
                                       
 Isolated cottages in the remainder of 
 the area have proved popular          
 investments for conversion into up to 
 date dwellings-thus commanding high   
 purchase prices when this type of     
 property comes on to the market.
