		<title>11RECREATION FISHING:MK WESTON</title>
		<content>Hidden by over hanging trees amongst   
farmland in the South Eastern corner of
Market Weston there lies a round and   
very deep pool. It is a favourite haunt
of village boys who like to try their  
skill at fishing with rod and line: one
can catch not only the common Stickle- 
backs but also Roach, Rudd, Tench &amp;    
Pike.The pond's name 'The Pikel'was    
likely derived from the latter in years
past. It was once used by horse-drawn  
carts to collect the water for daily   
use as depicted on an old sign, which  
has now fallen down. Adults however    
rarely visit this village pond now.    
Moorhens nest in a tree-stump which has
fallen across it reeds grow in pro-    
fusion around its edge and birds nest  
in the trees above. There is           
tranquility, disturbed by none but the 
young fishermen.
