		<content> There is a wide range of{entertainment
 in Tadcaster. For example, there are  
 the{Youth Clubs,}concerts and discos. 
 The Youth Club caters for a wide age  
 range and there is much to do. There  
 is pool, snooker,darts,table          
 tennis,indoor soccer and other games  
 to play and it is very cheap. There   
 are also organised trips, for example,
 this year (1985), there is one to     
 Paris. I like the youth club but      
 prefer to go to the pubs and clubs    
 with my Dad as there is plenty of ale 
 and good pool and snooker tables, plus
 arcade games. The{discos}are very     
 good and often they are run to raise  
 money for{charity} such as the youth  
 club itself or for the Save the       
 Children Fund or for famine relief in 
 Ethiopia
