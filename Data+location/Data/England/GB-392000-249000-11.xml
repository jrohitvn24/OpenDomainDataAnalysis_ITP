		<content>   We asked the people how long they   
 have been living  in Pinvin. Most     
 people have lived there most of their 
 life.                                 
   We asked them if they enjoyed living
 in Pinvin. They said that it was not a
 very interesting village, but the     
 people here are quite friendly.       
   Old people have their owns          
 organisations which help them to pass 
 their time more pleasurably. There are
 over 60's meetings, womens institute, 
 bingo ,jumble sales, fetes and        
 strawberry teas.                      
   We asked them if they went to church
 and if so how often. Nearly everyone  
 went when they could, but found it    
 difficult to walk there every week.   
   Many of the older folk believe in   
 ghosts and most of them believe       
 in reincarnation.
