 few keep livestock.This varies with   
 the farmers choice.In our area we can 
 find:  {Pigs}are intently farmed. Many

 house.The breeding{sows}have their    
 piglets which are kept for 14 weeks   
 and fatterned for market.{Bullocks}are
{male beef cows}which are allowed to   
 graze in fields on grass.In winter    
 they are fed on lesser quality ceral  
 crops.These are kept for two years and
 sold for beef.{Sheep}are let to graze 
 in paddocks with extra food when the  
 grass is{poor.Ewes}produce{lambs which
 are fattened and sent to market. We   
 have many families in our area who    
 own small amounts of land.These people
 are called{smallholders}.They keep    
 small numbers of many various types of
 livestock.this is mostly used to      
 supply food for themselves.           </content>
