 Very few households are without a car.
 It is almost a necessity in an area   
 such as this. People without transport
 can use the ambulance service to      
 attend clinics, which comes from      
 either Chester or Crewe. Meals on     
 wheels are cooked at Bickerton        
 Institute and delivered by local      
 ladies on a voluntary basis three     
 times a week to the elderly and       
 housebound people in the area. There  
 are volunteer drivers who take old    
 people to a day centre in Tarporley,  
 and also to keep appointments in      
 nearby towns or villages.             </content>
