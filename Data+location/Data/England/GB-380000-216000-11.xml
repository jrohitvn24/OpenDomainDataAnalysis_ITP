		<title>11GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL</title>
		<content> THE ABBEY CHURCH WAS STARTED IN 1089  
 A.D. AND FINISHED IN 1242 A.D. IT IS  
 MOSTLY BUILT FROM COTSWOLD STONE, BUT 
 THE BOTTOM COURSES ARE MADE FROM      
 HARDER STONE TO SUPPORT IT.  THIS     
 HARDER STONE CAME FROM MINCHINHAMPTON 
 THE TOWER IS 225 FT. HIGH. THE TWO    
 TYPES OF ARCHITECTURE USED ARE        
 PERPENDICULAR AND NORMAN. THE         
 CATHEDRAL CLOISTERS ARE SITUATED ON   
 THE NORTHERN SIDE WHICH IS UNUSUAL    
 BECAUSE IT WAS USUALLY ON THE SOUTHERN
 SIDE, WHICH WAS NEAREST A BUSY ROAD   
 AND NOT SUITABLE FOR MONKS AT PRAYER. 
 THE CATHEDRAL IS ALSO THE BURIAL PLACE
 OF EDWARD 2ND WHO WAS MURDERED AT     
 BERKELEY CASTLE IN 1327. SPRING WATER 
 WAS BROUGHT BY CONDUIT FROM ROBINSWOOD
 HILL GIVING A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF CLEAN
 WATER.  THE MONASTERY WAS DISSOLVED BY
 HENRY 8TH.                            
                                       </content>
