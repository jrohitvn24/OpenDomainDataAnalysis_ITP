 As a very small community, Stanhoe is 
 not able to have its own medical      
 centre but uses the doctors' practices
 in either Burnham Market or Docking.  
 One of the Burnham doctors lives in   
 Stanhoe.  People without transport are
 able to make use of a community bus on
 Mondays and Fridays.  Medicines are   
 delivered regularly to the post office
 where they are held for collection.   
 The nearest dentists are in Fakenham  
 and Hunstanton.  The nearest chiropody
 clinics are mobile vans visiting      
 Docking and North Creake.  Home Helps 
 visit a number of old people, and     
 nurses based on the practice at       
 Burnham Market will attend bed-ridden 
 patients.  Handicapped people manage  
 with help as above, plus willing      
 friends and in some cases state help. </content>
