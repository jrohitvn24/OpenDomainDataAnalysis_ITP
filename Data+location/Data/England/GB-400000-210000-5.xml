		<content>The size of the fields on the farms in 
this area has increased considerably   
since 1945.At present the majority of  
the of fields range between 7 &amp; 15     
hectares.This growth is caused by the  
removal of field boundaries,which is in
turn a reflection of the increasing use
of large farm machinery.               
 Some fields seem to have increased by 
only 5%,whilst others seem to have     
grown by as much as 30%.In one case    
five fields had been joined together to
make one.                              
 There is much evidence of a variety of
different field boundaries.These       
include dry limestone walls,hedgerows, 
barbed wire,post and rail and electric 
fences to control the grazing area of  
livestock.Generally,the dry stone walls
were in a bad state of repair because  
of the high cost of maintenance at     
present compared with the 19th century.</content>
