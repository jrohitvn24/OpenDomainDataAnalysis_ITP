		<title>05THE DEARNE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> The{Fire Station}is on the border     
 between Goldthorpe and Bolton.  The   
 Fire Station has been there since the 
 1940's.  They have{one engine}which is
 very old; they have 15 men but they   
 all have fulltime jobs.  The Fire     
 engine is nearing the end of its life.
 It is a{retained}fire station which   
 means that they are not fulltime      
 firemen; they are called only when    
 needed and are not on standby.  They  
 dealt with{333}fires, mostly small    
 ones, and quite a number of false     
 alarms last year.
