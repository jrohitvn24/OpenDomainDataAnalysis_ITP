		<title>03Rolvenden Church: Activities</title>
		<content>   It is an expensive job to maintain  
 the Church buildings and keep them in 
 good repair so there are many         
 different fund-raising activities each
 year.                                 
   This year there was a{Flower        
{Festival}in May.  The Church was      
 decorated with flowers and looked very
 pretty.  There was a display of arts &amp;
 crafts by local people. Refreshments  
 were on sale in the Village Hall.     
   There was also a{Sponsored Walk and 
{Run}which raised Â£600.{Coffee Mornings
 are often held too. They are usually  
 held in people's houses or gardens and
 everyone brings something to sell,    
 such as cakes, plants or clothes.     
 They also pay for refreshments and buy
 what other people have brought so that
 money is raised.  It is a good chance 
 for people to catch up on the latest  
 Village gossip!                       </content>
