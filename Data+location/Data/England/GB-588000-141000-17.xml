		<title>17Smarden Village Children</title>
		<content> In the week I get up at 7.30, dress,  
 have breakfast and go to the bus stop.
 The school bus arrives at 8.30. It's  
 30 minutes to Tenterden, picking up   
 pupils from Smarden &amp; outskirts on the
 way. Some children have to sit 3 to a 
 seat on our coach though it's a 53    
 seater. There's about 30 in my form &amp; 
 1000 in the school. On Sundays I get  
 up late, practise my clarinet &amp; after 
 Sunday dinner play the piano.         
{Farm Child}...our land is clayey and  
 when it rains it's very sticky but    
 when it's sunny it's as hard as rock. 
 We have a sheep dog named Jess &amp; some 
 ducks. My sister likes to ride her    
 pony but I prefer my BMX bike. We     
 often climb trees &amp; make camps in the 
 thick hedges. My favourite place is   
 jungle island in the middle of a pond.
 There's a secret way to it and my     
 friends and I can hide there.         </content>
