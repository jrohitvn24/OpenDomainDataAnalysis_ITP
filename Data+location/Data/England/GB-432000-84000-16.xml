 First we decide who will be it.  Then 
 the person chases people.  When the   
 person touches you, you are it next.  
 Any amount of people can play it.  The
 circle in the playground is home.     
 PIGGY IN THE MIDDLE                   
 Three people can play, one is the pig.
  The two people stand opposite each   
 other a few metres apart and the pig  
 stands in the middle, one of the      
 outside people have a tennis ball and 
 throw it to each other trying not to  
 let the pig catch the ball.  If the   
 pig does catch the ball the one who   
 threw it goes in the middle and       
 becomes the pig.
