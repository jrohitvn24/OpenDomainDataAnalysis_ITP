		<content> In addition to such traditional games 
 as{Rugby,Football,Hockey(all usually  
{played during the winter),Cricket,    
{Tennis and Athletics(all usually      
{played in the summer),a}number of less
 usual activities may be viewed during 
 childrens playtime.                   
{British Bulldogs}is one such game.This
 game is{generally played on a field or
{between two buildings}.One person is  
 then chosen to be{"it"}.This person   
 takes up a position directly between  
 the two areas of safety:opposite ends 
 of the field or either one of the two 
 buildings.The{objective for those     
{standing in the "safe areas"is to run 
{past the "it"}to the opposite end of  
 the field{without}being caught and    
 dragged to the ground.If they are     
 caught then they too become "it".This 
 continues until everyone has been     
 caught.                               </content>
