		<content>   There were many other businesses    
 in the village which have now         
 closed down. The most recent was the  
 general stores run by Tom Wright, who 
 now only delivers milk.  An egg       
 packing depot closed down in 1969.    
 There also used to be a brick-making  
 business and a second pub called the  
 Union Inn.                            
   The council houses at Allington     
 Terrace are named after Lord Allington
 who was a former Lord of the Manor.
