		<content> This area has many mixed farms. Lower 
 Barn Farm is typical. It is owned by  
 Peter Moorhouse. He even has willow   
 trees on his farm which are used as a 
 crop for fencing and cricket bats. He 
 has many fields near the river where  
 his herd of 130 Friesian Cows graze.  
 He also has 730 sheep which are       
 crossed Border Leicester and Swaledale
 bred for fleece and sold for meat. He 
 has some Suffolks for showing. The    
 sheep graze on hilly fields which are 
 more difficult to cultivate. They are 
 dipped against diseases and sheared   
 once a year. The crops he grows are   
 sprayed to prevent weeds and fungi;   
 and to help the crop to grow. He grows
 milling wheat, feed barley, silage    
 grass, potatoes and sometimes beans   
 for his animals.
