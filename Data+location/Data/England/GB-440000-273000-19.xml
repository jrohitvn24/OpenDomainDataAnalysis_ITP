		<content>{Christianity}is the main religion     
 though there are people with minority 
 beliefs. Children learn about         
 comparative religions. St. Margaret's 
 Church and the Baptist Chapel provide 
 the main buildings for worship, the   
 former having a traditional male vicar
 and the latter having its{second woman
{minister.}A C.E. church has stood on  
 the same site for 900 years. The      
{Stewardship Campaign}begun in 1985    
 requires people to give their time,   
 energy and a small amount of finance  
 to help in promoting Christian        
 attitudes in the Village. The Sunday  
 School services the youngest children,
 the Quest group is for 10-14 year olds
 and there are Bible reading groups and
 prayer and praise meetings held in    
 local homes. The{Baptist Chapel,}over 
 100 years old, still serves the needs 
 of a small section of the community.  </content>
