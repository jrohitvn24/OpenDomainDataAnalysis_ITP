 P.E., swimming, music as well,        
 Art, craft, all are swell.            
 At a quarter to four the bell rings   
 And teachers say,"Collect your        
                              things." 
                                       
                                       
 We all go home and have our tea,      
 Bangers, chips and eggs for me.       
 Then we go to play by the green,      
 On roller boots,bikes we all are keen.
                                       
                                       
 As soon as it's dark we all go home,  
 We practise our instruments on our    
                                   own.
 Hobbies, homework, shower, TV,        
 Then after that it's bed for me.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
