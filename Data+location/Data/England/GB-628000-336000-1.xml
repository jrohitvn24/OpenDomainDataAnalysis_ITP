		<content>  The shoreline of the North Sea runs  
 diagonally across our area, the N.E.  
 forty percent of the map being sea.   
  At low tide fine sandy beaches reach 
 to the foot of tall crumbling cliffs, 
 rising to a height of seventy metres. 
  Mundesley is a 'large' village that  
 grew up where the river Mun follows a 
 small gap in the cliffs to the sea.   
  The rest of the coast goes up through
 farmland and caravan sites to the     
 small village of Trimingham, which is 
 itself slowly crumbling into the sea  
  Most of the inland area is covered by
 rolling agricultural land. mainly     
 growing barley,wheat or sugar beet.   
  Gimingham is a picturesque farming   
 village lying on the banks of the Mun.
  This is a quiet rural area now being 
 influence by the nearby Bacton Gas    
 Site,whose industrial workings are    
 easily visible by day or night.       </content>
