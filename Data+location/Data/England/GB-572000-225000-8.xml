		<title>08Great Priory Farm.</title>
		<content>      The farm is owned by the three   
 daughters of{John Tabor}of{Bovingdon  
{Hall.}It is farmed in conjunction     
 with the{Tabor Estate.                
      On the land is the site of the   
{Priory.}Hopefully, one day the site   
 will be excavated but the{County      
{Archeologists}are busy investigating  
 sites threatened by new building. We  
 were surprised to hear that there is  
 no legal protection for the site.     
 However the bumpy surface is a good   
 safeguard against the plough.         
      There are two thatched barns,    
 from the 13th and 17th centuries. Both
 need re-thatching and grant aid may be
 available for the older one. The cost 
 is estimated at about Â£19,000. There  
 is also a 16th cent. granary. In the  
 newer barn,{Lucy Tabor's}husband,{John
{Gray}is making furniture. This small  
 family business is known as{Craftsman.</content>
