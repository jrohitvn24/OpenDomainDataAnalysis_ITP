		<content> This is a small hamlet of twenty one  
 houses. The name is Cornish for{little
{hamlet.}It is situated one mile north 
 of the village of Breage. It          
 originated as a mining settlement, the
 men working in the Wheal Vor tin mine.
 At that time it had its own pub and   
 meeting house called the{Trelawney    
{Arms.}Today this is a private house.  
 When a pub local farmers paid their   
 rents and bills in the pub. In the    
 hamlet is a spring which supplied all 
 the local farms and the village of    
 Carleen and Trew itself. The village  
 has a{green }which was thought to be  
 common land but has recently been     
 claimed by the owner of the former    
 Trelawney Arms. Carleen Sunday School 
 annual outing still visits the green  
 and performs a figure of eight dance  
 on it. The significance of this is    
 unknown.                              </content>
