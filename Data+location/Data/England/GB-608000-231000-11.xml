		<content> Manningtree Green looks peaceful      
 today but in the 16th century Matthew 
 Hopkins executed many, so called,     
 witches. Nowadays it stands as a      
 lonely memorial. During the years 1560
 to 1645 75 witches were hung. He did  
 various tests to see whether they were
 witches or not, one was where the     
 witch was thrown into the river. If   
 she floated she was guilty if not, she
 was innocent. This process was called 
 swimming witches. Matthew Hopkins was 
 hung in 1649 after he too was accused 
 of being a witch. Nowadays, when      
 people take a photo of the Thorn      
 Hotel, they say they have seen his    
 ghost.
