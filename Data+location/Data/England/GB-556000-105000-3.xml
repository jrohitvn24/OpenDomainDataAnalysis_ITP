		<title>03POLEGATE TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> ON WEDNESDAY 26 JUNE 1985,FOUR OF US  
 WENT TO THE A22 TO DO A TRAFFIC SURVEY
 FOR THIS PROJECT. THE A22 IS A VERY   
 BUSY MAIN ROAD RUNNING FROM EASTBOURNE
 TO LONDON, PASSING THROUGH THE WESTERN
 EDGE OF POLEGATE.                     
                                       
 WE WATCHED FOR 30 MINUTES AND COUNTED 
 THE NUMBER OF MOTORBIKES,BRITISH CARS,
 FOREIGN CARS AND OTHER VEHICLES.      
                                       
 MOTORBIKES        26 >                
 BRITISH CARS     595 >                
 FOREIGN CARS     177 >                
 OTHER VEHICLES   172 > TOTAL - 970    
                                       
 WE NOTICED THAT FORD CARS WERE THE    
 MOST POPULAR ; FRENCH AND JAPANESE    
 CARS WERE THE MOST POPULAR OF THE     
 FOREIGN CARS. THERE WERE A LOT OF     
 COACHES ON THE ROAD AS WELL.
