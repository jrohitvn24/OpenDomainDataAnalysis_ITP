		<title>12CLUBS IN N.FERRIBY.</title>
		<content>   On the second Thursday of every     
 month some{PENSIONERS}gather in a     
 welfare{CLUB}in Brough.Around 200 are 
 members and around half turn up every 
 time.Membership of the club costs     
 25 pence and members talk and have    
 guest speakers. Bingo and raffle help 
 to finance it.                        
   Eight years ago the club was started
 and now draws people from surrounding 
 areas including North Ferriby.        
  The{WIVES' GROUP}get together because
 most of the women don't get to see    
 each other often, so they meet every  
 fortnight on Wednesdays in the        
 Methodist Church school room. They    
 have people in for talks on different 
 subjects.They have trips sometimes.It 
 costs one  pound for a yearly         
 membership.There are about 30 members.
