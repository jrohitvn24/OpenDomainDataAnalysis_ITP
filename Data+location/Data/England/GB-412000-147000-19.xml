		<title>19CUB SCOUTS</title>
		<content>  On Wednesday nights boys between 7   
 and 11 years can go to Cubs.There is a
 uniform which is a green jumper and   
 cap, a yellow scarf and a woggle, a   
 plastic ring that keeps the scarf to- 
 gether round the neck.                
  The sub is 20p a week which helps to 
 pay for some of the things they do.   
 There are several groups in the pack  
 and each has a 'sixer' who leads the  
 group and a 'seconder' to help him.   
 The pack leader begins the evening    
 with a grand howl and everyone salutes
 the Union Jack and promises to be good
 Cub Scouts. In the summer the pack    
 then play a game outside before they  
 start working for badges. The badges  
 are for example, artist, home help,   
 swimming, writer's, book reader etc:  
  At the end of the evening the flag is
 lowered and the Cubs go home.
