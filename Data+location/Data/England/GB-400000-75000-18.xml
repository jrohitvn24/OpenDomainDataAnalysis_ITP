		<content>      Much of the study area is used   
 for farming. A large part of the      
 Country Park is leased to local       
 farmers where 'conservation' farming  
 is undertaken; to encourage the       
 development of hay meadows, with      
 associated flora and fauna. Parts are 
 also grazed or used for cereal crops. 
      Further west grazing, and cereal 
 crops are also the major form of      
 farming. The animals grazed include   
 goats, sheep, beef cattle and heifers,
 ponies and horses.                    
      There are many spoil heaps which 
 are left to grow wild, remains of     
 quarries. Also two small stone        
 quarries exist in the study area,     
 where extraction of Purbeck stone     
 continues.                            
      Two farms are within this        
 block,on one a youth camp is sited    
 annually each summer.                 </content>
