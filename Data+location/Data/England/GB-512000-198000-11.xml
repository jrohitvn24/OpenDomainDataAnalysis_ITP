		<title>11BATLERS GREEN SHOPS</title>
		<content> At Batlers green the people who own   
 the shops are very helpful and        
 friendly.                             
 There is a clothes shop which also    
 sells wool, buttons, cotton and other 
 haberdashiery; a butcher; a hardware  
 shop which sells china, batteries,    
 household and garden implements; a    
 Post Office and a supermarket.        
 My mother does most of her shopping in
 Radlett but my Granny finds the shops 
 very useful because they are so close.
 There are flats above the shops for   
 their owners, but other people live   
 there as well.                        
 For them the advantage of convenient  
 shopping is balanced by the           
 disadvantage of having to be quiet    
 during shop hours.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
