		<content> Cold Norton Primary School; stands    
 near the centre of the village in St  
 Stephen's Road, and has , in 1985, 125
 children attending between the ages of
 4 and 11. There are at present five   
 classes. It is an interesting building
 constructed in three different stages,
 the oldest part having been built in  
 1914 and the newest part which        
 includes the school hall having been  
 finished only last year.              
    The School has a family atmosphere 
 where the teachers and the children   
 usually get on well together and try  
 to help each other wherever possible. 
 Children here are never smacked or hit
 by the teachers but they are expected 
 to behave well and to have good       
 manners both to teachers and to each  
 other. Often children will visit other
 schools or places  of interest.
