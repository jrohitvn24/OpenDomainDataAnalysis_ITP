   Scorton Feast started in 1700, and  
 used to be a one-day event.It started 
 at Bolton church, inside the church   
 porch.The men drank a lot of beer     
 which was kept in barrels in the porch
 so that the witches could not poison  
 it before the feast.The entertainment 
 was mainly races which started at the 
 church porch.The only holiday people  
 were allowed was on a feast day.      
   Nowadays Scorton Feast lasts for    
 four days in mid August and begins    
 with a cricket match on the           
 Sunday.The sports,the fancy dress and 
 the fair take place on the green;the  
 gymkhana,sulky racing and BMX races   
 are at Mr.Barkers farm;the childrens  
 tea and the disco is in the           
 institute,and the gymnasium is used   
 for the flower and produce show.
