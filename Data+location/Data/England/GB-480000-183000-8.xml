		<content>   The old school,Post Office and      
 vicarage are now private houses.      
   There is scarcely any evidence now  
 of the Bronze Age Camp on the hill    
 over looking Medmenham but the        
 dwelling known as Staes is now a      
 private house.Originally it was the   
 home farm of the Norman lordship.     
   Lodge Farm was built in 1612.It was 
 originally a hunting lodge.At the     
 present time it is a stock farm rented
 from the National Trust.
