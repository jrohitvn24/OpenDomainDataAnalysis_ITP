		<content> Originally they were built to house   
 the coastguards.                      
 The newer dwellings are mostly        
 detached houses and bungalows on      
 in-fill sites, although there are some
 small groups (estates) recently built.
 In an area near the coast, at Eccles, 
 there is a large estate, the Bush     
 Estate, with a variety of types of    
 dwellings; wooden Chalets, and some   
 bungalows.                            
{DESIGN FEATURES                       
 Double-glazing of windows is becoming 
 increasingly desirable on this Eastern
 side of Norfolk, and many of the newer
 dwellings have this feature, as a     
 protection against the bitting East   
 wind. The older types of homes had    
 small windows and thicker walls, and  
 often, elabrate porches as their      
 protection.
