		<title>11Medical Care in the Area</title>
		<content> The two villages come together in this
 respect. Elsworth has no medical      
 facilities and the population uses the
 Health Centre at Papworth Everard.    
 Neither village has a dentist. A      
 community car scheme is run in        
 Elsworth for those who do not have    
 transport to the surgery.             
                                       
 As 50% of the population of Papworth  
 Everard is handicapped, health care is
 clearly important.                    
                                       
 The hospital at Papworth is now a     
 specialist one and has no casualty    
 department. The nearest hospitals with
 these facilities are Hinchinbrooke    
 Hospital at Huntingdon and            
 Addenbrooke's in Cambridge.
