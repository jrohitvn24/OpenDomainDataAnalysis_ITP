		<content> Adjacaent to St.Mary's Church, Salford
 is the recently restored Georgian     
 Manor House. The only thatched        
 building in the area, a listed        
 building, has been converted from     
 three cottages into a single dwelling.
 The Old House opposite the derelict   
 Wesleyan Chapel is a successful blend 
 of l7th and 20th century workmanship. 
 The Old School and School House facing
 the Swan are examples of Victorian    
 architecture featuring a bellcote on  
 the roof. The Old Parish Hall and the 
 Old School have been combined to form 
 the present Village Hall.  Old Mill   
 House and the Round House provide a   
 focal point to the village of Hulcote 
 together with the nearby Aspley Hall  
 Farm.
