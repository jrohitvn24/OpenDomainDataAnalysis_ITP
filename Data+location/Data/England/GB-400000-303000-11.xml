		<content> When we looked at the different types 
 of jobs done by people in our area we 
 found that there was a great variety. 
     The reason for this is because    
 there is not one major employer within
 a 5 mile radius of Pelsall.As we have 
 seen already most people travel out of
 Pelsall to quite a number of local    
 destinations.                         
      Quite a large number of people   
 are retired and a substantial         
 percentage of ladies are housewives.  
      In fact we found that out of 125 
 people surveyed there were 41         
 different jobs represented.           
      Here is a list of the ten most   
 popular:Engineers,School Cleaners,    
 Office Workers, Leather Workers,      
 Joiners,Drivers,Shop Assistants,      
 Stockman,Electricians and Secretaries.
