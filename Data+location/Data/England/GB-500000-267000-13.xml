		<title>13Farming in Yelden</title>
		<content> Farming is the principle industry. 90%
 of the area is farmed by only 4       
 farmers or farming companies. Only 1  
 farm has more than 100 cows for       
 milking. The main crops grown are     
 winter wheat, oil seed rape and winter
 barley. The soil is fertile and grows 
 good crops but only after intensive   
 land drainage. Very few men are       
 employed on the land as the farms are 
 highly mechanised. The field sizes are
 generally 30-40 acres.                
 Orchard Farm are Agricultural         
 Contractors and are employed by the   
 County Council to cut the verges and  
 tend the woodlands.They are also wood 
 merchants and supply many villagers   
 with loggs at Â£12 per half load.      
 A mobile sheep-dipping, lambing and   
 shearing service is run from Bottom   
 Farm.
