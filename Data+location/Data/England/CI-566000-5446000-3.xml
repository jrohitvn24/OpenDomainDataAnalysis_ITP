		<title>03The History of My House</title>
		<content>                                       
 My house is called Millemont, which   
 means a thousand hills. Where it now  
 stands there used to be a small Jersey
 farmhouse with stables and barns which
 were built in the 19th century and    
 belonged to my grandfather. In 1969,  
 my father had the outbuildings knocked
 down and had Millemont built. It is   
 copied from a French chateau which    
 my father liked very much. The        
 entrance to the house is an archway.  
 At the top of the arch is a granite   
 stone with my father's and mother's   
 initals engraved on it with the date  
 of the house (1969). This is an old   
 Jersey custom to show who owned the   
 house and when it was built.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
