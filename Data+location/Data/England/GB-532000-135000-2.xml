 villages in the{High Weald.}They are  
 built on adjacent ridges dissected by 
 the headwaters of three major rivers  
 in south-east England; the{Ouse,}the  
{Medway}and the{Mole.}A mile to the    
 west, in the valley of the Mole, lies 
 the hamlet of{Rowfant.}The{geology}of 
 the area is{Upper Tunbridge Wells Sand

 clay. In the past, the clay was used  
 for making{bricks}and the sandstone   
 was used as{building stone.}Also,{iron
