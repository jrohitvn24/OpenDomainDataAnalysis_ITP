 games and art and craft activities but
 the Secondary children show no        
 interest in these pursuits. Very few  
 of all the children use their leisure 
 time enjoying music but many spend    
 time looking after pets.              
 7. Gardening is a very popular        
 activity for both men and women. It is
 at least a weekly occupation for over 
 65% of them. It is interesting to note
 that 91% of the women cook daily while
 only 3.7% of men can claim the same.  
 Over half the men spend a great deal  
 of time maintaining the house and car.
 Music and visits to the theatre or    
 cinema are only rare activities.
