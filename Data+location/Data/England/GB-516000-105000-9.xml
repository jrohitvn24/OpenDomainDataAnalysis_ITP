		<content>  When the building for the new school 
 (to be named White Styles Middle      
 School)was ready in 1974, the old     
 school building was left empty.       
  In 1978 Dr.J.Sibley Hibbs opened the 
 building as the Community Centre.     
  There are 2 main roons,an office,a   
 kitchen, a committe room, toilets and 
 a store room. On the south end of the 
 building are living quarters which are
 in need of repair.                    
  Sompting Community Centre Playgroup  
 meets there on three mornings         
 (mon,wed,fri) from 9.00 to 12.00.     
 The children are aged between 3 &amp; 5   
 years and are given a third of a pint 
 of milk and a biscuit. The children   
 were playing with a climbing          
 frame,sand,lego, a train, painting,   
 play-do,strickler bricks, car etc.    
  There are eighteen children on the   
 roll,sixteen of whom were present.    </content>
