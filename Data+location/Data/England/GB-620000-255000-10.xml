  Otley School is linked with Grange   
Farm Otley owned by Mr Russell Ling.   
The idea of the project is to enable   
the children to visit a local farm to  
study the many and varied aspects of   
agriculture. Mr Ling has a fairly small
farm growing wheat, barley and winter  
beans. In addition he keeps pigs,      
cattle, chickens and ducks. He also has
a few horses. There is an old farmhouse
which dates from the 17th century and  
some very old buildings including a    
timbered oak barn. Mr Ling lives in a  
modern farmhouse. The children visit   
the farm 4 times a year. Mr Ling talks 
about his work and his crops. He allows
the children to handle the animals and 
to see all the machinery in action.    
Rather surprisingly in a rural area    
many children know very little about   
farming.                               </content>
