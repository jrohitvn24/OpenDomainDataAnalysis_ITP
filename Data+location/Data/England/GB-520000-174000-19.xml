		<title>19       MORTLAKE RESIDENTS</title>
		<content>  The elderly people like it in        
 Mortlake because it is very quiet and 
 friendly, but they have one main      
 problem - some of the houses are damp 
 and they need modernising.            
  We found that on average people had  
 been living here for 40-45 years.     
  The middle-aged people thought there 
 is a good variety of schools and      
 places to take young children; they   
 dislike the noises of planes and the  
 smell of petrol fumes. The main       
 problem seems to be the high price of 
 things, and lack of parking spaces.   
 The average time they had been        
 residents here was 9-12 years.        
  The under-16s think this are is full 
 of activities and their main dislike  
 the dog litter.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
