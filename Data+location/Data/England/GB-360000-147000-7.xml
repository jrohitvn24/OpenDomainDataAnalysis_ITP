		<title>07LOCAL EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> There is very little unemployment in  
 the area as the people who live inthe 
 villages tend to do so because of the 
 surroundings rather than the          
 employment it offers. Most people go  
 to work in the nearby towns, but those
 who remain in the villages work mainly
 in the service industries such as     
 building or as electricians and run   
 their businesses from home. There is  
 also a leather worker, a trailer maker
 and repairer. In Oakhill the local    
 builder still remains the local       
 undertaker. One or two new, small     
 industries are starting up such as a  
 cement stone manufacturer, furniture  
 maker and antique pine renovator. All 
 these only supply one or two jobs and 
 young people expect to travel away to 
 find work, unlike the old days when   
 the brewery alone supplied a 100 jobs.
