		<title>17PIG SALTING TABLE</title>
		<content>   We  went to visit{Coppice Farm.Mr   
{Cook}showed us his{pig salting table, 
 which was in his pantry.              
   The pig salting table is a{large    
{sandstone slab}about two and a half   
 metres long and a metre wide.Around   
 the edge is a curved groove which is  
 used as a drain.                      
   A square of pork was on the slab and
 salt rubbed into it.The salt mixed    
 with the juice of the meat and ran out
 as brine into the grooves and drained 
 away.This was called{curing}the       
 pig.They had to do that because they  
 did not have refrigerators and the    
 meat would have gone off.             
   When they came to a month without an
 "R" in it no pigs were killed because 
 it was to hot.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
