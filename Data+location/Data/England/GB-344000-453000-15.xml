		<title>15The local environment.</title>
		<content>The nature of the land is of mainly    
flat,open farmland interspersed by     
dykes, a canal and the yacht basin.    
Some of the water is fresh, whilst     
other is salt. The River Conder is a   
mixture of the two, and the area around
Conder bridge is a bird-watchers       
paradise, particularly for waders,     
where conditions are ideal i.e. tidal  
waters and mud rich in crustaceans     
providing a constant source of food.   
One can also find here species such as 
heron,kingfisher and dipper.           
Most of the block lying west of the    
road running through the middle  is    
completely flat, whilst that to the    
east contains a mixture of hills and   
broadleafed woodland.
