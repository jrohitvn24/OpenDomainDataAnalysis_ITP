		<title>07SHOPPING IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content>   When we did a survey on where most  
 people did their weekly shopping,we   
 found that most people shopped at     
 Asda they shopped there mostly once a 
 week.The next popular was the Co-op   
 then Kwick-Save then finally          
 Sainsburys.Nobody shopped twice a week
 at the Co-op or Sainsburys.A lot of   
 people go to the Harrows pub          
 off-licence for sweets or a bottle of 
 pop.Some people go to the Bungalow    
 shop or the Jet garage if the         
 Newsagents is closed.A lot of girls   
 and boys from about 11-16 year olds go
 to Lincoln on saturdays to get things 
 like new shoes etc.as there are not a 
 lot of choice of clothes or shoes in  
 Hykeham.Some older people may only go 
 to Lincoln three or four times a      
 year.                                 
 I think that another clothes shop     
 would improve Hykeham village.        </content>
