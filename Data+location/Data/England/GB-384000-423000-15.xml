		<title>15Landscape of the Valley</title>
		<content> The landscape of the block is varied. 
 Main roads run along the valleys      
 connecting the old settlements with   
 a ribbon development of houses and    
 factories which are right by the      
 roadside. There are few streets at    
 right angles to the road;where there  
 are they do not extend far and the    
 effect is claustrophobic.             
    Immediately behind the houses the  
 land rises steeply.The lower slopes   
 are used for dairy and sheep farming  
 and horse breeding. Very few fields   
 are cultivated other than for hay.    
 There are vast stretches of open      
 moorland above 1000 feet which support
 heathers or bog. Many tracks and old  
 roads connect valleys over the moors. 
 Nowadays these are enjoyable walks for
 ramblers and everywhere the moors can 
 be seen rising above the rooftops.
