		<title>14Canals and their uses</title>
		<content>    The canals at Buckland are part of 
 the Grand Union Canal. The Grand Union
 is the longest canal in Britain. Along
 the canal are lots of keen anglers.   
 Also sometimes you get a lock. Locks  
 are used for going down or up hill on 
 a canal. Lots of anglers in Aston     
 Clinton are members of Tring Anglers. 
   They are a fishing organisation     
 which lets you fish free once you     
 have obtained your membership. Lots of
 anglers can differentiate between     
 each fish they catch.                 
   The fish you find in the canal are  
 Chubb, Tench and some Gudgeon. Tring  
 Anglers say that after you catch the  
 fish you must put them back to        
 conserve the fish stock. The canal may
 be polluted in some places as somebody
 fell in and caught a disease which    
 later killed the person.
