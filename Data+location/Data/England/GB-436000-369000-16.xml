		<content>   Chesterfield has a police force of  
 over{350 civilian staff}housed in a   
 modern headquarters on Beetwell       
 Street, since September 1981. The     
 nerve centre of police operations is  
 the{communications room}with its array
 of sophisticated equipment, used for  
{round-the-clock surveillance.         
 Chesterfield and the whole north      
 eastern part of the county became one 
 division in 1968.{Panda cars}and      
{police dogs}have been used since then.
{Pedal-power}has also been recently    
 re-introduced on the streets.         
 According to a senior officer, this   
 does not signal the end of the car    
 units but an attempt to get the best  
 of both worlds.{Comprehensive policing
 of the town's streets has always been 
 the watchword of the local force, but 
 methods have changed over the years.
