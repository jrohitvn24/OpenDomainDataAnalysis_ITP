		<title>03"Bowcombe"-Cheverton Farm 1.</title>
		<content>  {Cheverton Farm}comprises about 550  
 acres of chalky downland typical of   
 this area. The present owner, who has 
 held the land for about fifty years,  
 already has two further generations   
 following in his footsteps. Like the  
 other farms in the area; arable       
 farming is combined with the          
 husbanding of sheep and cattle. Unlike
 the others, however, the hilly nature 
 of the land poses special problems,   
 which necessitate the use of special  
 equipment such as "crawler" tractors  
 and three wheeled motorcycles for ease
 and safety of working and getting from
 one part of the farm to another. Over 
 the years the owner has devoted       
 considerable effort to reclamation of 
 some of the more rugged areas of his  
 land; a continuing process facilitated
 by the developments in agricultural   
 machinery and technology referred to. </content>
