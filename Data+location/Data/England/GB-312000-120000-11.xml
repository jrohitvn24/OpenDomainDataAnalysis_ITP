		<content> The village has quite a large area of 
 Council Housing.Some are in single    
 roads,but the main area is Oaken      
 Ground.However some of these Council  
 Houses are now privately owned.The    
 Primary School is situated in Oaken   
 ground itself and has a substantial   
 field for recreation.                 
  There are many individual,private    
 houses in between the Council areas.  
 The main village is on a small road   
 which runs northerly from the A38.This
 road joins the B3187 at Tonedale.It   
 passes through the newer Private      
 housing area of Lower Westford,and    
 continues past the older housing of   
 Linden Estate.The main Linden House is
 now a Private Nursing Home.
