 The first things a small child        
 recognises outside the home are the   
 animals and farm machinery, tractors  
 etc. In the towns there are youth     
 clubs and coffee houses in the country
 there is the Young Farmer's, this is  
 open to anyone under 26 years of age. 
 Apart from farming husbandry &amp; skills 
 the Young Farmer's has a social side  
 with outings, dances, &amp; exchanges     
 between areas  &amp; countrys. Comps., &amp;  
 representation at the Agricultural    
 Shows. For the farming adults there is
 the National Farmer's Union. It helps 
 in a practical way by explaining the  
 changes in rules &amp; regulations (taxes 
 &amp; Common Market,etc.)                 
 This is considered a safe Conservative
 seat,perhaps because the Conservative 
 candidate is generally connected in   
 some way with farming.                </content>
