		<title>10Plant Life in Spring</title>
		<content>   During the year we have watched the 
 progression of plants along our bank  
 and hedgerow.  The hedge consisted of 
 the following plants :-               
  Privet, Hawthorn, Sloe, Plum, Dog    
 Rose, Ash and Elderberry.             
   The steep bank beside the hedge was 
 planted with daffodil bulbs in l983 by
 local families. At the top of the bank
 rare white violets were seen along    
 with purple ones.  The Spring was late
 but we saw snowdrops, celandines,     
 primroses, buttercups and above in the
 field, cowslips and scillas. Later we 
 saw bluebells and wild arum.          
   We have noticed a reduction in the  
 number of flowers in the last few     
 years which may be due to the         
 increasing use of  pesticides and     
 fungicides.
