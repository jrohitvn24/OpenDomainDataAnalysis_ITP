		<content> The area is situated on the northern  
 side of the valley of the {River      
{Dearne.}The highest point is at {     
{Staincross}, 165m above sea level. Two
 thirds of the area is either reclaimed
 industrial land, farmland or          
 wasteland. There have been many       
 schemes to reclaim the land used for  
 coal mining. The spoil heaps{Muck     
{Stacks!}at {Mapplewell}and{Athersley} 
 have been smoothed out and replanted  
 with grass and trees. The land in the 
 S.W. is still left as wasteland. There
 are no working farms in the area. Most
 of the farmers have sold their land   
 for housing development. The farmland 
 in the area belongs to farms in other 
 areas, and is used for growing some   
 cereals, fodder or grazing.
