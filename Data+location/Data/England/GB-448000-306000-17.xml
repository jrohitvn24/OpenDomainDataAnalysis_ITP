		<title>17RATBY BAND.</title>
		<content>     Ratby Band was formed around 1906.
 It has a varying membership but is    
 usually between 30-40.The band has    
 been to Germany and Holland and has   
 made one record called 'Reflections'  
 which was quite successful.The band   
 has given several notable performances
 but the most outstanding was the one  
 which won them the World Championship 
 in Holland.The band meets two or three
 times a week in the local working     
 men's club but would dearly love to   
 have their own band room.The band     
 helps to teach young musicians to play
 brass and percussion instruments so   
 they can play at carnivals and fetes. 
 The local community benefits from the 
 efforts of the band because they help 
 to raise money for various funds and  
 give pleasure at the same time.Bands  
 are traditional and those who belong  
 enjoy the music and company.          </content>
