		<title>04MY PET</title>
		<content> My pet is a goldfish and I have had it
 for 2 years and 7 months. I got it    
 from Fishlake Water Gardens. I went   
 with my next door neighbour so he     
 could get some apple trees. There were
 millions of fish in big tubs. I went  
 to the tub with goldfish in it and he 
 asked me if I wanted one so I said    
 yes. I chose my own so I got a        
 polythene bag filled it with water and
 got a net and caught one and put it in
 the bag and then I went for a drink of
 cocoa cola and then I went home. I    
 bought a goldfish bowl and some       
 coloured stones. When I got home again
 I filled it with water and put the    
 fish in it and as soon as I put it in 
 it jumped out again so I poured some  
 of the water out again and then I went
 to the shop for some fish food and fed
 it.
