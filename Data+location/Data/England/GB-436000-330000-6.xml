		<title>06The Spider Bridge, Derby</title>
		<content> The Spider Bridge was built in the    
 early 1970's. It spans the junction of
 four very busy roads - Osmaston Road, 
 Harvey Road, Osmaston Park Road and   
 Chellaston Road.It is made of steel,  
 with grit on the top where you walk.  
   In the summer the bridge is quite   
 often used, but in the winter it is   
 very slippery. Most people think it is
 not easy for mothers with prams or old
 aged pensioners to use.               
   It is called the{Spider Bridge}     
 because it looks like a gigantic      
 spider. It has railings along the side
 so that no-one falls off, as it is    
 quite high so that lorries and large  
 vehicles can pass underneath.         
   A small number of people get scared 
 crossing the bridge, as it vibrates   
 when heavy lorries pass under it.
