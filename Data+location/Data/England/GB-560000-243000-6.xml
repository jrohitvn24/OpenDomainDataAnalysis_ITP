 I live on Moat Farm.It is owned by    
 Mr. Haylock who lives near by. My dad 
 works there. There are 12 men on the  
 farm.We have got 1100 pigs and 114    
 cows. My dad and his mate feed them   
 every day. On Sundays one man feeds   
 them all. There is a workshop for     
 reparing machinery.The farm has bought
 two new tractors.One is a Ford 8210   
 four wheel drive. We have a new       
 sprayer which cost Â£25,000.           
 We do not grow crops on this farm.    
 I live with my family in a house on   
 the farm.We rent it as Dad is on the  
 farm.
