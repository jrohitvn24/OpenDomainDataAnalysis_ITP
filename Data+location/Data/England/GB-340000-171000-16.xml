		<title>16My Dad broke Clevedon Pier 2</title>
		<content> _Mr.Gay_ Just after 10.00 a.m. when   
 I was taking my second set of readings
 I found that I could not take some of 
 the measurements. Thinking that       
 perhaps the men had disturbed the     
 equipment, I went to the cafe opposite
 where they were having their tea break
 _Nicola_ Then what happened?          
 _Mr.Gay_ As we stood there, we heard  
 an almighty BANG!....and the end pair 
 of legs and spans of the pier         
 collapsed and fell into the sea. We   
 cut the remaining water bags and      
 removed the test load from the pier.  
 _Nicola_ Could you have saved the     
 pier?                                 
 _Mr.Gay_ No. We were expecting a      
 vertical bending of the pier. In fact 
 the failure was caused by a sideways  
 movement. This took only 10 minutes!  
 _Nicola_ Were there any injuries?     
 _Mr.Gay_ Only a little hurt pride!    </content>
