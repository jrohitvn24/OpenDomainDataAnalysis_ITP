		<content>   {GOLDSTONE GHOUL                    
{ }Years ago there was a young man who 
 was disformed and very ugly.          
  It is said that the vicar had him    
 chained up and sealed in a hollow     
 tree. He was left to die.People say   
 that they hear his screams when they  
 pass by the hollow tree.              
   {THE GHOST OF MR. BREEZE}           
  On the Yelves housing estate there is
 a man who is said to walk through     
 walls. He plays the violin on his     
 travels....!                          
{   THE CARRIAGE GHOST                 
{ }On the old main road to Newport, on 
 certain nights, can be seen the ghost 
 of an old-fashioned carriage rattling 
 along. We cannot find an explanation  
 for this.
