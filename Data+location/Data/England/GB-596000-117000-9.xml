		<content> Apart from the holiday camps a great  
 proportion of the prosperity of Camber
 depends on the day visitors and       
 weekend campers.  The man who runs the
 trampolines and bouncing castle hires 
 out windbreaks and deckchairs; the    
 beach cafes, gift shops and amusement 
 arcades are all largely dependent on  
 the day visitors, as  of course are   
 the car parks.  Even the grocers, post
 office and general stores, the garage 
 and the public houses need a large    
 influx of visitors in order to enable 
 them to survive the lean winter       
 months. Most of the businesses are    
 family run, employing a few people and
 casual labour in the summer.  The     
 holiday camps employ seasonal staff,  
 with a few personnel to maintain the  
 sites during winter, and a small      
 amount of building.
