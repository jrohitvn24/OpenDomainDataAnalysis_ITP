		<title>11Local Policewoman</title>
		<content>   W.P.C.Bennett is a policewoman who  
visits our area regularly.She likes to 
get out to meet people.She has been    
specially trained to help them and to  
prevent crime.She wears a uniform and  
is sometimes seen in a car or sometimes
seen patrolling the estates.She works  
in shifts so sometimes she is seen at  
night and sometimes during the         
day.During the long holidays the police
organise activities for schoolchildren.
   The W.P.C. not only arrests men and 
women who she finds breaking the law   
but attends road accidents and gives   
talks in schools on road safety.She    
helps to find children who are lost.   
There is not a lot of crime in this    
area as it is a rural area.            
   She is in constant contact with the 
police station by personal radio.
