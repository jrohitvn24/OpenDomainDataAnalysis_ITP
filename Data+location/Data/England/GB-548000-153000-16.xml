		<title>16 Local Churches</title>
		<content>On the 10th of July we went out on a   
survey, looking at local churches.     
We saw 7 churches altogether. The      
first    church we saw at the top of   
the town was St.Nicholas, which is     
Church of England (C of E). The        
building is very old with a bell       
tower. The next church we saw was The  
Vine Baptist Church and on the corner  
opposite was The Vine Evangelical      
Church. This is a much newer church.   
At the top of St.Johns Hill we passed  
the United Reform Church, a church     
with a very high spire. A few minutes  
later we passed St. Johns Parish       
Church also C of E, but slightly       
higher than St.Nicholas. We kept on    
going until we reached St. Margaret's  
Catholic Church. We drove back         
towards the town passed the Methodist  
Church after which we went back to     
school.                                </content>
