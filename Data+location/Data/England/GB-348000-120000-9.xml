		<title>09THORNE CHURCH</title>
		<content>  Thorne, tucked away in a lane that   
 seems to have naturally born the name,
 can easily be observed from a stone   
 seat in the churchyard and can be seen
 to mainly consist of old stone        
 houses.The stables of a vanished      
 priory have been converted recently   
 into cottages.The small towerless     
 church has been restored so leaving   
 only the 13th. century door and       
 lintelwork unchanged. It has an oak   
 pulpit,carved chairs in the           
 santuary,brass altar rails and a      
 screen of oak.There is an urn shaped  
 font of ornate masonwork from         
   Ilchester  Gaol. There is also a    
 rectory garden from where,  above the 
 rectors roof, the Gaol bell can be    
 seen.
