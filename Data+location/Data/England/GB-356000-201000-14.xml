		<title>14The Free Wood.</title>
		<content>{William the Conqueror}appointed a man 
 to do a survey on Hewelsfield         
 village.He had to write down all the  
 land cover but he wanted to keep a    
 piece for the village and himself.So  
 William never knew about{the Free Wood
 as it was called. People used to come 
 and gather {as much wood as they could
{carry}but they were not allowed to    
 bring a cart and fill it with wood. It
 was only {the amount they could carry 
{they were allowed to take.}This       
 happened every day for years.The {    
{mayor of Bath and Wells}still owns    
 some of the Free Wood and it is fenced
 off.Some times people still go and    
 collect wood from the free wood.
