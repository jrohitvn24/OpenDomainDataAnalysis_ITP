		<content> He first went to school in Beauchamp  
 Roding and then Abbess .  While there 
 he had to get in the coal and do some 
 gardening.   He left school at l4;    
 his first wage was 5s (25p) and he    
 worked 8 hours a day and did not go on
 holiday.   This gentleman's           
 grandchildren still live in the area. 
 All the people who chose to live here 
 (i.e. have moved here) need their own 
 transpoort as Public Transport covers 
 very little of the area.   They enjoy 
 the peace and quiet of the countryside
 and gardening.   They keep pets and   
 have varied interests.   Many enjoy   
 local ecology i.e. bird watching etc. 
  They like to keep in touch with      
 cultural life, perhaps the theatre and
 use London frequently.   The majority 
 live in large old houses with big     
 gardens.
