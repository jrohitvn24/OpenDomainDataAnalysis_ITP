		<title>10Government of the area</title>
		<content> The Government of the area is a bit   
 mixed and confusing. There are three  
 Councils: The County Council, the     
 Borough Concil and in parts of the    
 block Parish Councils. The County     
 Council looks after the roads, clears 
 away all the rubbish and waste, looks 
 after the schools and pays the        
 teachers, supplies the fire and police
 services. The Borough Council supplies
 the recreation facilities in the area 
 and builds and maintains Council      
 houses. In Milton and Kemsley it also 
 looks after the roads. Parish Councils
 are in Iwade and Bobbing which supply 
 the little things that people need,   
 like bus shelters and seats but who   
 also complain and suggest to the other
 councils what they can do to help in  
 the villages. The children of Iwade   
 and Bobbing like council elections    
 because they have a day off school.   </content>
