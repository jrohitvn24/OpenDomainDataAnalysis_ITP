		<content> The area around the Tarn is also well 
 wooded, beech again being the         
 commonest tree, followed by oak, scots
 pine and silver birch.                
 This year, under the direction of the 
 Warden, school children have helped to
 plant five thousand young trees,      
 mainly beech and oak, to replace trees
 blown down in gale three years ago.   
 Between Milton Hall and Tarn Road,    
 along the 'Dandy' - an old railway    
 track - is a large plantation of      
 conifers, mainly Norway spruce, with  
 broad leaved trees bordering the wood.
 Some felling and replanting is done.  
 A much smaller stand of conifers can  
 be seen between Milton and Farlam.    
 In the last ten years,{Dutch Elm      
{disease}has been spreading in the area
 and already a number of Elms have     
 succumbed.
