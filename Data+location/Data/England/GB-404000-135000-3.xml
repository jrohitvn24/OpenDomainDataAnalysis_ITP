		<title>03Buildings,Wishford area.</title>
		<content> There has been little new building in 
 the area,though there are small       
 estates of council houses in          
 Stapleford and Wishford.Most houses   
 are old,and privately owned.          
{Notable buildings in Wishford.}       
 The Almshouses,stone and flint,built  
 in 1628.The school built in 1722.The  
 oldest house in Wishford is probably  
 Yew Tree cottage.Wishford Farm House  
 was built in Tudor times,and altered  
 in the Georgian era.Old Station House 
 is all that is left of the Great      
 Western Railway Station.              
   Wishford House,at the top of the    
 hill,was built in Georgian times.     
 Chequer cottage is so called because  
 the walls are made of squares of stone
 and flint.The old Rectory,opposite the
 Church,was built in Tudor times,but a 
 Georgian front was added.
