		<title>19LIFE AT SCHOOL IN CAYTON</title>
		<content> I have lived in Cayton all my life and
 it is very peaceful here. I go to the 
 pimary school and enjoy it. I like    
 most of the lessons and all the sport.
 I don't like exams much but usually   
 they are not quite so bad as expected.
 I have dinner at shool and like most  
 of the food but hate mushy peas.      
 Actually I like sweet food better than
 meat or potatoes. Most of the time I  
 wear casual clothes like T_shirts and 
 jeans and body_warmers. On special    
 occasions like concerts when I am in  
 the choir or orchestra I wear our     
 school colours _ royal blue and white.
 Sometimes I have to wear a suit and   
 tie which I don't much like doing.    
 This year I leave primary school and  
 go on to the comprehensive school. I'm
 a bit frightened but I suppose I'll be
 all right when I get there.
