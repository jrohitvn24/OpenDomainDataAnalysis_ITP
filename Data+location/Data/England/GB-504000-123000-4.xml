		<content> Cock o'Rooster                        
 You go around the playground calling  
 "Cock o'Rooster", then someone shouts 
 "All against the wall" and the last   
 against the wall is "It".  That person
 chooses someone and that person tries 
 to dodge across the playground. If you
 are caught, you choose.  The person   
 who caught you stays to help you      
 catch. You continue until everyone is 
 caught.                               
 Hopscotch                             
 You draw ten squares on the playground
 with chalk and arrange them so that   
 squares two and three are above one,  
 four above htree and two, five and six
 above four, seven above five and six, 
 eight and nine above seven and ten    
 above eight and nine.  You get a      
 little stone and throw it on the      
 squares.                              
                                       </content>
