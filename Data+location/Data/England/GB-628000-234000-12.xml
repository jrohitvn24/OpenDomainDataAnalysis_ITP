		<content>    I get up at{6.00am}on school days  
 and go for a run before breakfast.For 
 that I like 2 weetabix with milk,and  
 fruit juice.I change and go to school 
 at 9am.We  have maths,science,language

 We have a 15 minute break in the      
 morning and afternoon.I have packed   
 lunch which consists of 4 meat or     
 cheese sandwhichs with brown bread and
 some fruit.School ends at 3.30.I go   
 home and change into play clothes and 
 go out to play with my friends.       
    About{7.00pm}we have our tea.I like
 curry and rice best but we might have 
 meat and potatoes or salad.I watch    
 some television,then get ready for bed
 at 9.00pm and go to bed about 10.00pm.
