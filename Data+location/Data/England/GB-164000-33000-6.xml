		<content> In February, class 3 went to          
 Camborne Police Station.  When we     
 got back, we had to complete a        
 police folder. In early March, the    
 choir went to a{music festival}and    
 came 2nd. Also in March the hockey    
 team went to a tournament and the     
 "A" team all won medals. During       
 June, classes 2 and 3 went to         
 Trewidden Gardens. After that we      
 went to the beach at Porthcurno to    
 have lunch. When we had had lunch,    
 we all went on to the{Minack Theatre. 
 We saw a presentation of The Hobbit.  
 A week after the Minack visit, class  
 3 went to Camborne Fire Station. We   
 watched a film about fire prevention  
 and then we looked at some fire       
 engines. During the year the school   
 has had a sponsored walk, a school    
 fete and presented a concert to       
 commemorate {Crowan Feast.}           </content>
