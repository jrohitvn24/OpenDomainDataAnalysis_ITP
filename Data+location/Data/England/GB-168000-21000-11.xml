{THE PINK LADY}                        
                                       
 A hundred years ago on a dark night a 
 maid was savagly murded by the owner  
 of{Bochyn Manor.}She was repeatedly   
 and viciously stabbed with a          
 dagger.Her back was terribly slashed  
 and it was a slow,lingering death.    
                                       
                                       
 It is said that her killing was for no
 real reason and on certain dark,cold  
 nights,in the stillness of midnight,  
 she appears on the bridge laughing a  
 screaching,piercing,haunting,laugh.   
                                       
 If you have the misfortune to be near 
 Bochyn Manor late at night watch out  
 for the{Pink Lady.}
