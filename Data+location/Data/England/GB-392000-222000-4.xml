		<title>04THE NW EDGE OF CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content>  A mix of{farmland,}nurseries, resid- 
 ential, industrial and unused land a- 
 waiting development. At Swindon Farm  
 70% of the cereal crop is fed to beef 
 stock.A farm shop sells potatoes.{    
  Nurseries are family concerns growing
 flowers, vegetables and salad crops on
 good soft loam. The produce is grown  
 either outside or in polythene houses 
 for sale on site or at market.        
  An interesting feature of the        
 residential use of the area can be    
 seen in Homecroft Drive. Ten of these 
{houses}were built in 1926 as part of  
 the Cheltenham Homecroft Housing      
 Association Scheme when, after World  
 War 1, chosen areas of particular     
 towns were encouraged to survive as   
 self-sufficient communities.Two of the
 properties still retain many of the   
 original features but the rest have   
 been modernised.                      </content>
