 We went to{Peldon Hall,}where we      
 could see{Abberon  Reservoir. }The    
 owners are the{Sawdons. }They have got
 two  dogs, one is  a horror, the other
 dog was friendly and quiet.           
 Peldon Hall is an old house.{Mrs      
{Sawdon}has got a collection           
 of unusual scissors on the wall in the
 kitchen. Peldon Hall had some         
{pigs,}but they sold their pigs and all
 of their land is used for growing     
{wheat.                                
{                                      
{Peldon Hall}was built some 600 years  
 ago and has since been extended in the
 sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. It
 has many interesting features,        
 including a lovely 18th Century       
 staircase with a moulded handrail.
