		<title>09The New People of Wellington</title>
		<content>   Wellington and its surroundings has 
 the largest ethnic population in      
 Shropshire.Asians and West Indians    
 arrived in the early 1950's.They      
 settled here because of the good job  
 opportunities.                        
   The immigrants here feel they are   
 Salopians,for the third generation,who
 are now entering the schools,were born
 in the local hospital,and are truly   
 British.However they do still maintain
 many of their ancestors' customs.     
   The Mosque on Tan Bank,once a       
 Methodist Chapel,reflects the change  
 in the population and their beliefs.  
 The old Hadley School,which closed in 
 1973,is now a Sikh Temple.            
   The old established Christian       
 churches are still thriving,Non_      
 Conformist,C of E,Mormons,the Gospel  
 Church and the Spiritualist Church are
 all represented in this area.         </content>
