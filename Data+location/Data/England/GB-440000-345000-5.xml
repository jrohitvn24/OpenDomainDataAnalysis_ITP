		<content>{(Housing in Marlpool). }              
 The area we have studied is called    
 Marlpool because of the old clay pits 
 on Ilkeston road. The housing in the  
 area has all been built since the clay
 pits became disused. Most of the      
 houses belonged to the council        
 originally and were built in 1946.    
 Today half of the houses are private  
 and half are council owned. 70% of the
 houses are semi-detached. Most of them
 have 5 or more rooms and are heated by
 gas. There are a very few cottages and
 flats and some bungalows for the old. 
{(Family size) }                       
 The average family size in this area  
 is 2 adults and 2 children. Of        
 families with children 49% have 2     
 children 23%-3,16%-1,5%-4,1%-5,11% of 
 families have only one parent living  
 at home. About 30% of households have 
 no children living at home.           </content>
