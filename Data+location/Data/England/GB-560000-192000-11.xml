		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content> Farms in this area tend to be large   
 and arable. The largest is Hall       
 Farm, Ingrave. It covers 600 acres, of
 which 550 are{arable.}The crops grown 
 are winter wheat, barley and oil seed 
 rape. These are rotated annually. A   
 subsidy for these crops is paid by the
{E.E.C. }As well as its own combine    
 harvester, the farm has seven tractors
 with various attachments. Only four   
 men are{employed}on the farm.         
     In recent years many of the       
 fields have been enlarged by the      
 removal of hedgerows. A few patches of
 woodland have been left. Most of the  
 land is gently sloping and the clay   
 soil requires underground drainage.   
 the only livestock are 60 store       
 bullocks, fattened on pasture. In the 
 winter the wheat straw provides       
 bedding and the barley straw feed,    
 supplemented by hay and cattle cake.  </content>
