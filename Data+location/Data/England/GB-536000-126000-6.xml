		<content>     In Horsted Keynes we have a Post  
 Office, a butcher's and two shops that
 sell most everyday things like food.  
 There is also a mobile grocer and     
 greengrocer who comes round twice a   
 week. Many people go to the super-    
 markets in Haywards Heath or East     
 Grinstead for their main weekly food  
 shopping.                             
     The village butcher sells pet     
 foods, animal care products and toys  
 as well as meat. The Post Office also 
 supplies confectionery and stationery.
 At the food shops you can get videos, 
 wines and spirits, hardware and some  
 general household supplies. One of the
 shops is a building society agent.    
     We are quite lucky to have so many
 shops as we are only a small village; 
 but some people would like more such  
 as a newsagent, a teashop, a fish and 
 chip shop and a chemist.              </content>
