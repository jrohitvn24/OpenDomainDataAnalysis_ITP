		<title>17Smuggling</title>
		<content> Smuggling had a great impact on the   
 people of Mudeford in C18.To help     
 couteract this men and ships were     
 stationed at Southampton,Cowes and    
 Poole.To counter land smugglers 4     
 Riding Officers and Supervisor were   
 stationed at Christchurch.During the  
 'great run'of contraband in July 1784 
 the master of the 'Orestes'(sloop     
 stationed at Cowes)was shot and later 
 died.The smugglers used Haven House   
 Inn(still standing)to shelter in.A    
 smuggler,George Coombes,was executed  
 for this crime.His body was probably  
 returned to the Haven Quay where it   
 was hung on a gibbett in an iron cage.
 John Streeter,another smuggler,lived  
 in Stanpit where he ran a snuff       
 factory,smuggling tobacco for this    
 purpose.He was imprisoned at          
 Winchester in 1786 but escaped        
 later recorded as living in Stanpit.  </content>
