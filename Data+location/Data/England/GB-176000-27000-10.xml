		<title>10SCHOOLS IN MAWNAN</title>
		<content> The old school was built in 1834.By   
 1971 it was too small and in a bad    
 state.In 1972 a{new school}was built. 
 In 1985 there are 120 pupils in the   
 school with 4 full time teachers      
 including headmaster and 2 part time. 
 There are 2 dinner ladies who cook the
 dinner and an ancillary who looks     
 after the rising 5's and a caretaker.

 and helps you enjoy learning.We also  
 have lots of{equipment}including:     
 2 BBC computers with monitors and disc
