		<content> Plummers Plain Garage is owned by a   
 Mr. Lockyear but the forecourt is     
 owned by the man who turns the pumps  
 on and looks after the till.  He has  
 been working at the garage for 23     
 years.He has about 300 customers on a 
 normal weekday. Opening hours are     
 8.00-7.00. The busiest time of day is 
 6.0-7.0 pm. The manager employs 10    
 people. The garage became self-service
 last year and the manager says this   
 pleased everyone. He works about 10   
 hrs a day. The garage sells about 20  
 cars a week. The workshop told us that
 the most common repair is replacing   
 brakepads. They repair about 5 cars a 
 day. They also do MOTs which take     
 about half an hour each. The workshop 
 hours are 8.30-5.30.
