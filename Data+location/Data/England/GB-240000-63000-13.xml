		<title>13Tamar Valley _ Weir Quay</title>
		<content> This is an ancient deep-water quay on 
 the Devon bank of the Tamar, with the 
 old 'hards' now many feet under mud.  
 Below the quay is a ruined lime kiln  
 with double furnaces, and traces of   
 other old buildings connected with the
{industry}of the past. However, the old
 quay is still in regular use, as the  
 fast developing Weir Quay Boatyard has
 laid down over 100 moorings, where    
 there is special interest in the      
{employment}of repairing and caring    
 for traditional wooden vessels.       
 Boating,{fishing}, and water sports   
 are proving a popular{recreation}for  
 local people as well as visitors to   
 the area. There are three houseboats  
 moored at the quay, one of which, an  
 old Tamar Barge, is permanently       
 occupied.
