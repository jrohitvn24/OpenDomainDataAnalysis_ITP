		<title>07Dotton Pumping Station</title>
		<content> Dotton Pumping Station is on the road 
 between Newton Poppleford and Colaton 
 Raleigh.It has an automatic pumping   
 system so most of the time no one is  
 there but two men were there when we  
 went.All the water comes from         
 boreholes.There are three at Dotton.  
 the water is pumped into the reservoir
 which holds half a million gallons of 
 water which are pumped eight times a  
 day. Every week a water sample is     
 taken.You look through a thing a bit  
 like a camera to match the colour of  
 two samples of water to see if it is  
 suitable to drink.This tests the      
 chlorine content.                     
 Dotton Pumping Station supplies the   
 water for part of Sidmouth.It gets the
 water from the reservoir at Core Hill.
 When there is a drought the man said  
 people use too much water in their    
 gardens.                              </content>
