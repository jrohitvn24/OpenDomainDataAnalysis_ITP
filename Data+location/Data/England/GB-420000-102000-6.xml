 school only had one long room. Miss   
 Warren was head mistress.The children 
 used to pay one penny but it was      
 raised to two old pennies.Children    
 did not have school dinners until 1939
 In 1841 the ground was formally taken 
 over by the Vicar and Church wardens. 
 The school was built on two acres of  
 land granted by the forest,and placed 
 as a church of England school,under a 
 mixed committee of church men and     
 nonconformists.Today the school       
 consists of a main building with four 
 classrooms and entrance hall,outside  
 toilets, storage sheds, dining room   
 and cycle shed.There is a school wood 
 land area.The school has 3 classrooms 
 and one hall.The next school you go to
