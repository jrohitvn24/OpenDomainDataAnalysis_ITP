		<title>01A PICTURE OF RISELEY</title>
		<content>      Riseley is a pleasant place in   
 which to live - people moving into the
 village are soon under its undefinable
 spell.  It is not grand - there is no 
 'Manor House' nor is there a 'Squire'.
 For at least a couple of centuries it 
 has consisted of not more than 200    
 houses.  Since the l960's however     
 several new estates have been built,  
 greeted not too rapturously by the    
 'Riseley folk' but over the ensuing   
 years the benefit to the village has  
 been apparent.  New blood has expanded
 the community and has resulted in a   
 large new Village Hall acting as a    
 centre where all, ranging from the    
 Toddlers' Club to the "Over 60's "    
 meet.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
