		<title>16The Hearing Impaired Unit.</title>
		<content> There are 2 units in Belford,1 in the 
 First,and 1 in the Middle School,with 
 a specially trained teacher of the    
 deaf in each.There are 7 children in  
 the First,and 5 in the Middle School  
 unit.They travel long distances,from  
 Amble in the South,Eyemouth in the    
 North,and Alnham in the West of the   
 County.Belford was chosen to house the
 units because of its central position 
 and its proximity to the main A.1.road
 which enables the children to come to 
 school in the winter.                 
 The children are taught to speak      
 rather than tomake signs.They         
 integrate with hearing children in    
 order to learn to be like them.The    
 teachers have to deal with a wide     
 range of deafness.All the children    
 have hearing aids _some post_aural,   
 some body_worn aids and some phonic   
 ears.                                 </content>
