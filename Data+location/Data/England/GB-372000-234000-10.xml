		<content> The woodlands throughout the area are 
 planted with softwoods and hardwoods. 
 The predominate species are chestnut, 
 oak and cherry and a few other        
 broadleaved varieties. The faster     
 growing softwoods are interplanted for
 protection against bad weather and to 
 encourage growth. Some parts of the   
 area suffer from lack of soil and are 
 susceptible to drought. Bracken and   
 heather tend to be the only survivors 
 in these areas. Varieties of wild     
 orchids can be found in Hospital Wood 
 near the A 417. The rare Star of      
 Bethlehem flower can be seen growing  
 on the roadsides near Bromesberrow    
 School and in a few of the cottage    
 gardens. The Malverns are a haven for 
 naturalists. We discovered an         
 enthusiast who had recorded sightings 
 of 67 species of birds and 25 species 
 of butterflies on Raggedstone Hill.   </content>
