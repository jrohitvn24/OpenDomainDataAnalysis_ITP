		<title>04THE A45 IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> The A45 road links the Cambridge area 
 and the East coast, passing Newmarket,
 Bury St. Edmunds, Stowmarket and      
 Ipswich.  It carries goods and people 
 to and from the ports.  The A45 is    
 quite a new road.  It has two         
 carriageways and a central            
 reservation.  The verges are planted  
 with young trees of many kinds.       
 We counted the traffic on the A45.  We
 stood on a bridge. First we counted   
 the traffic going East (Towards       
 Stowmarket) for ten minutes.  We used 
 a stopwatch.  We looked for cars,     
 diggers, motor-bikes, buses, tractors,
 police cars, caravans, lorries, fire  
 engines, ambulances, vans, breakdown  
 trucks and three-wheelers. 112        
 vehicles were going East, 121 vehicles
 were going West.  Altogether we       
 counted 146 cars, 53 lorries, 27      
 vans,4 motor-bikes and 3 caravans.    </content>
