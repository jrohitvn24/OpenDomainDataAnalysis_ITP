		<title>19THE LIFE OF AN 11 YEAR OLD</title>
		<content> My name is Daniel Cant and I live at 2
 Hungate Road. I like football and     
 watching Dallas. I like to wear a tie 
 and lots of fashionable clothes. In my
 family I have a Mum and a Dad and a   
 big sister that goes to the Senior    
 School and she is a prefect. My mum   
 works on a farm and my Dad is a       
 contractor. I have only one pet and   
 she is a cat. She is a breed of tabby 
 and she has a lot of colours on her   
 coat and she is called Tina. My house 
 is on an estate and it is new and it  
 is made of bricks. I have a big garden
 and it has lots of flowers in the     
 spring and summer. In the house is a  
 big staircase and three bedrooms and a
 sittingroom and a bathroom and a      
 kitchen. In my bedroom I have a Man   
 Utd wallpaper and a Man Utd quilt and 
 curtains.
