		<content> There are at least 106 places of work 
 in shops, garages, pubs, etc (each    
 with an unknown number of employees), 
 while at least 881 people work in the 
 part of Haydock Lane industrial estate
 in this survey area,and 12 at Princess
 Pit. In relation to the amount of     
 housing in this area there are        
 insufficient jobs to support all the  
 residents. This is borne out by a     
 survey of some classes at Legh Vale   
 school where 92% of fathers,and 89% of
 mothers in employment worked away from
 the locality. In the same survey 20%  
 of fathers and 12% of mothers were    
 self-employed.
