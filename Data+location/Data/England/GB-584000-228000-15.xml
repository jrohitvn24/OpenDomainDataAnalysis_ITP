		<title>15HOUSING IN EARLS COLNE</title>
		<content> My house is 10 years old,nearly 11.It 
 is built of brindle bricks and it is  
 lined with breeze blocks,the roof is  
 made of tiles which are the same as   
 the ones on the garage . My house has 
 had 3 extensions,1 to make the kitchen
 bigger,1 for the utility and 1 to make
 a living room and another bedroom.    
     The house has 6 rooms downstairs  
 they are 1 sitting room,1 dinning     
 room,1 kitchen ,1 toilet ,1 utility   
 room and 1 living room . The upstairs 
 has 7 rooms ,4 bedrooms, 2 toilets and
 1 study.The boiler is in the utility  
 room and the Gas and Electricity      
 meters are under the stairs .Every    
 room exept the utility , the sitting  
 room (which has a fireplace) and the  
 study have radiators .My house is     
 typical of the new houses being built 
 in Earls Colne.
