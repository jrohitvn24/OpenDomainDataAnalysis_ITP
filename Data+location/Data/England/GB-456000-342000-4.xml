		<content> Porchester is a typical primary school
 and lies in the suburb of Carlton.It  
 takes seven to eleven year olds and   
 was built in 1908.The building is of  
 red brick and consists of eight       
 classrooms clustered around a central 
 hall in which we eat,hold assemblies  
 and have P.E. lessons on wet days.It  
 stands on a small plot of land which  
 is half grass and half concrete,but we
 don't have our own playing field as   
 many schools do.All 162 pupils go to  
 assembley each morning,then have a    
 variety of lessons which are          
 interrupted by two twenty minute      
 breaks and an hour and a quarter for  
 lunch.We leave school at 3.45pm.During
 the year there are sport's            
 days,parents' evenings,outings and    
 jumble sales to raise money and make  
 our school part of the community
