		<title>19UFFCULME REMEMBERED</title>
		<content>   There was a railway in Uffculme     
 until ten years ago. When I was a boy 
 I used to like to go down to the      
 station to watch the people getting on
 and off the train. As a very special  
 treat we would sometimes go on the    
 train to go shopping. You would would 
 go to Tiverton Junction where you     
 caught another train to Exeter,       
 Tiverton or Taunton. They were all    
 steam  trains then of course and much 
 more interesting than today's.        
   The other thing we used to love to  
 do was to go swimming in the river and
 bird's nesting. School was much       
 different then as well. We only       
 learn't a few subjects but we had to  
 learn them well. If we messed about or
 blotted our books we would get smacked
 across the wrist with a ruler. I think
 it made you respect your teacher more.
 Life was harder but we enjoyed it.    </content>
