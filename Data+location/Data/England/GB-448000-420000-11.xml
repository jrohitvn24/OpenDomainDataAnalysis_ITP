		<title>11ALLOTMENTS</title>
		<content> There are 51 allotments near our      
 school.Each one has a hut and some    
 have a greenhouse too.There are a few 
 taps so that the people can water     
 their plants and vegetables.Some      
 people keep chickens,for their eggs   
 and pigeons,for racing,on their       
 allotment.                            
 My dad's allotment was passed down    
 from members of my dad's family.Our   
 greenhouse isn't very large but inside
 there is a woodwork bench.We have     
 grown lettuces and tomatoes in it.On  
 the rest of the allotment we have     
 grown onions,cauliflowers,cabbage,    
 beetroot,red cabbage and many other   
 vegetables.My dad spends most of his  
 weekends at the allotments and some   
 weekday mornings as well.
