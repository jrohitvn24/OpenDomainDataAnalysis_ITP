		<content>    Only half the Parsonage reservoir  
is in this section , it supplies       
Blackburn . East of York by a minor    
road to Whalley is a small steep rocky 
area of common land called Cronshaw    
Chair .                                
    Apart from houses , farms and      
churches , covered elsewhere , the only
large group of buildings is named      
Langho Centre , until recently a mental
hospital now for sale ; several brick  
built wards and service blocks         
surrounded by lawns and gardens        
occupies 1250 m off the A59 .          
    Two elderly people's homes and a   
purpose built orphanage are at         
Wilpshire . The double track railway is
now used almost entirely for cement and
lime from Clitheroe .                  
    The A59 and the A666 both carry    
heavy traffic .
