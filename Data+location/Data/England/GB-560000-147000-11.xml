		<title>11Hadlow Castle</title>
		<content>   A prominent landmark in our area is 
 the 170 foot high tower of Hadlow     
 Castle.The castle and grounds are     
 privately owned and are not open to   
 the general public. We were kindly    
 given permission to look around the   
 grounds.                              
  We entered through the churchyard and
 went through an archway to the        
 courtyard.The buildings round the     
 courtyard consist of the coachouse,   
 stables,servant's quarters, the       
 domestic buildings of the castle      
 and the tower.Except for a few small  
 windows which have recently been      
 added,all the buildings retain their  
 original outward appearance, though   
 they have been changed inside to make 
 six separate houses.The rest of the   
 castle was demolished in 1951.        
  The tower has recently been offered  
 for sale at Â£120,000 but wasn't sold. </content>
