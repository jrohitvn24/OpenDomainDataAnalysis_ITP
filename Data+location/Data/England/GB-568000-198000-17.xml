 The Bakers Arms was once a pupil house
 converted from a cottage in the 16th  
 century.It was only a beer house not  
 allowed to sell wines or spirits.     
 It was called the Jolly Miller after  
 the 3 mills behind it on the common.  
 The Bear has two big linking chimneys 
 with a smoke chamber at the junction. 
 There is a story about Spider,a       
 drunken potman who used to climb      
 up the chimney in one bar and down the
 other for a pint.One day he never     
 came down and it is said his corpse   
 was found in the smoke chamber many   
 years later when renovation work being
 done.
