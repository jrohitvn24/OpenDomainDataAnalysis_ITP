		<content>   There has been a sewage works at    
 Prestbury for nearly 100 years. It    
 serves Macclesfield, Bollington and   
 surrounding villages. 30 million      
 litres of sewage come into the sewage 
 works in a normal day but if it is a  
 very wet day it increases to 180      
 million litres. The site covers about 
 half a square kilometre. The cleaned  
 water goes into the River Bollin and  
 the sludge is given free to the       
 farmers to use for fertiliser. 22     
 people work in the Sewage Plant,      
 Offices and Laboratory. On 12th July, 
 1985{Heidi Wright, Jane Barratt and } 
{Debbie Knight}were shown round the    
 Sewage Works by Mr. Piggott. Mr.      
 Piggott said that the workers got used
 to the smell and they were very happy 
 and healthy working there. Sometimes  
 he gets requests to look for peoples  
 lost false teeth and wedding rings.   </content>
