		<title>18 - CLUBS, ARTS AND CRAFTS</title>
		<content> There is a thriving folk club which   
 meets regularly during the winter     
 months in the Duncton Village Hall    
 and several well known people such as 
 Frank Ifield have performed there.    
                                       
 Because of the natural beauty of      
 the area many artists come to         
 paint the local scene. Members of art 
 clubs are frequently seen at weekends 
 sitting at their easels, particularly 
 at Burton Pond and in the woodland.   
                                       
 Two or three times a year craftsmen   
 display their jewelry, ceramics       
 and paintings etc, at an exhibition   
 held at Mansby Cottage, Coates.
