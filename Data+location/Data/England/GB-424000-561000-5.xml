 incorporates additional strengh to    
 enable it to carry an abnormal load of
{400 tonnes.}It carries 4 lanes of     
 traffic and 1 footway. The bridge has 
 a navigational clearance of{152m wide 
{by 26m above mean high water level.}To
 reduce the possibility of cracking    
 outside faces were provided with {    
{thermal insulation}throughout         
 construction. The total weight of the 
 bridge is{11.5 tonnes}and is shared by
 2 main piers.                         
   The completion of the new bridge    
 provides a route across the{River Tyne
 without the height or weight limits of
 its predecessors. It was officially   
 opened on 18th May 1983 by The        
 Princess of Wales.
