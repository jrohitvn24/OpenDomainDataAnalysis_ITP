This area of land has been little used 
apart from farming and fruit orchards  
for centuries,although pilgrims have   
visited Canterbury since the time of   
Becket.                                
However,the compulsory Education Acts  
of the nineteenth century have produced
a different type of pilgrimage. Daily, 
six thousand pupils journey to seven   
educational establishments,existing    
within three square kilometres.There is
a great diversity in both subject      
matter and age,and to emphasise these  
differences some information from      
parent and pupil interviews has been   
set out in note form,followed by short 
passages by pupils at the schools and  
their pupil visitors.                  
Research at the University about       
Halley's Comet begins our survey.
