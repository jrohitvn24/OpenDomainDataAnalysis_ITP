		<title>02A NIGHT AT THE DISCO</title>
		<content>  In Strood there is a night club      
called the Pink Elephant, it is a      
place where young teenagers can go     
with their friends.  It is open on a   
Tuesday night and starts at 7 p.m. and 
ends at 10.30 p.m. After 7.45 they do  
not let anybody in.                    
  The entrance fee is one pound and    
when everybody leaves pink sheets are  
given out allowing you to have free    
food next time you come.               
  The drinks of lemonade and coke are  
30p but alcohol is dearer.             
  A DJ plays all the latest records    
and there is usually a Â£burn' every    
week when two schools do break dancing 
and the DJ gives them marks.           
  I enjoy going to this club because it
is a chance to get out of the house and
also a chance to put on some dressy    
clothing.           By Nicola Melen
