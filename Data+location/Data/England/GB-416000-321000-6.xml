		<content>   Needwood School was once{Rangemore  
{Hall,}the home of the first{Lord      
{Burton.}                              
   In 1954 Staffordshire County Council
 opened the Hall as the{Needwood School
{for Partially Hearing Children.}The   
 school is set in beautiful grounds and
 has been a residential school for     
 these children since this time. At one
 time as many as{120 children}were     
 taught here.                          
   Now the life of the school is coming
 to an end, and it is due to{close down
 in{August 1985.}All the children have 
 been placed in other schools and the  
 property is to be sold.               
   Everyone is wondering what will     
 happen to this lovely building,       
 erected in 1900, and to what new use  
 it will be put.
