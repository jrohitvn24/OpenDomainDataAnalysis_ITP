		<title>05ROBERT HALL FARM - THE LAND</title>
		<content> The farm is at present tenanted by Guy
 Hope and covers 110 hectres. Because  
 of the climate which is rather wet and
 dull and the rough, steep terrain the 
 land is not suitable for arable       
 farming, so Mr Hope is a dairy farmer.
 In 1984 10 acres of land were drained 
 to improve the grass as regulations   
 encourage greater use of grass to     
 replace expensive cattle feed. Robert 
 Hall has a moor of 50 acres which has 
 been declared an area of scientific   
 interest by the NCC because of the    
 large number of rare wild flowers     
 there. Mr Hope is unable to touch the 
 land without permission but because he
 is unable to use it he is compensated 
 by the NCC.
