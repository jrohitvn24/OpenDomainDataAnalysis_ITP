		<content> This area has a very low population.  
 By far the most important source of   
 employment in the area is farming. The
 landowner (the Duke) and the tenant   
 farmer both live out of the area. The 
 shepherds and farmworkers live in     
 farmhouses at Greenside Hill, Hartside
 and Alnhammoor and in other houses in 
 Linhope. The old peoples home in      
 Linhope also provides a small number  
 of jobs for nurses and porters.       
      The children of this and other   
 areas in the Ingram valley travel to  
 first school at Branton (8 miles away)
 ,middle school at Wooler (15 miles    
 away), and high school at Alnwick (   
 also 15 miles away).
