		<content>  149 children were interviewed in the 
 junior classes about their parents'   
 employment. Many more fathers worked  
 full time than mothers (130 to 56)    
 while 40 other mothers worked part    
 time. There were 3 fathers who didn't 
 work compared with 43 mothers.        
  Very few of the men actually worked  
 in Burton Joyce,most travelling to    
 Nottingham or elsewhere.Similarly,    
 most women travelled to their work    
 though some were employed full time in
 the village. Even part-timers often   
 needed to travel to their jobs.       
  A mother who does work in the village
 Mrs.Fletcher,is one of 8 home helps   
 operating in both private houses &amp; at 
 Westwolds Blind Home.Her jobs include 
 washing,ironing,cleaning,vacuuming,
