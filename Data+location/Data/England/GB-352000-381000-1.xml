		<title>01RUNCORN THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content>  Most of the area of Runcorn          
 we have been looking at has been built
 within the past 25 years.It spreads   
 eastwards from the Old Town and the   
 industrial plant that border the River
 Mersey.To the south of the area are   
 housing estates,some a similar age to 
 those in our study,many much younger. 
 We have looked at the following       
 aspects within our 12 square km block:
 Local history,with particular         
 reference to Norton Priory; Farming   
 and the effects upon it of Runcon's   
 development as a New Town;Trade and   
 Transport,looking especially at the   
 Shopping City and the Busway;the      
 Ecology of the locality and also      
 Housing. Finally we include a personal
 account of life in Runcorn as seen by 
 an eight year old child.
