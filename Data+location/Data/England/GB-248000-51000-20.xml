		<content> Last lesson today is Maths. After     
 Maths I go and wait for the bus. I    
 ride on the bus to the village of     
 Wembury and go and help look after a  
 friends' children. I help until 6.00  
 pm. when my dad comes and picks me up.
 When I get home I do my Maths         
 homework, then I do my{clarinet       
 practice. If there is time after my   
 tea I watch some{television.}Then it  
 is time to get ready for bed. I go to 
 bed at about 9.30 pm. This is a       
 typical Wednesday for me.             
     Sarah Parfitt.                    
 Of the 71 first year pupils           
 interviewed,20 said that they went to 
{bed}at the same{time}as Sarah.The most
 popular time ,however,was 10 pm with  
 only a few boys staying up later.Five 
 did not go to bed until half past     
 eleven.                               
                                       </content>
