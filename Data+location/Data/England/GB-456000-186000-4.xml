		<content>Many Children and adults have {cycles,}
using them to travel fairly short      
distances to and from work, or for     
pleasure. Some people ride on three    
wheeled bikes called {tricycles.} A    
learner might have stabalizers fitted. 
People who work in a city where the    
roads are very crowded can carry a     
{fold up bicycle} in their car boot,   
park the car and then use the bicycle  
to travel more easily. Some children   
have {B.M.X bicycles} which are not    
meant to be ridden on the road but are 
used to do stunts and tricks or to     
race on rogh tracks. {Racing bicycles} 
are meant to be ridden on the roads    
which are kept clear of traffic while  
the race takes place. Cycle races also 
take place on special tracks either    
indoors or outdoors.
