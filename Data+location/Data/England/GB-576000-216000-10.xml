		<title>10White Notley School</title>
		<content>    There has been a school on the     
 present site for about{130 years}and  
 the original building is still in use.
 The school is a Church of England     
 controlled school and what is now the 
 school playing field was originally   
 part of the Vicarage garden.          
    The original buiding had an        
 extension built on about 15 years ago 
 for the youngest children, a first    
 demountable room about six years ago  
 and a second demountable in May 1985. 
    The school has 100 children for the
 first time in many years and has four 
 classrooms.                           
    The school has children from White 
 Notley but also from Black Notley and 
 Faulkbourne because the schools in    
 these villages closed down several    
 years ago. Well over half the children
 are brought to school by bus each day.
