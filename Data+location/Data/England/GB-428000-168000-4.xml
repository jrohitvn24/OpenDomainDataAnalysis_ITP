		<content> died in The Great War. There is a tree
 for each life lost, and there are     
 fifteen trees in all.Also in the      
 churchyard there is a{headstone}to the
 memory of John Stocker who died at the
 age of 101.This lies in the area which
 was the original churchyard. People   
 had to pass through grounds with barns
 and outbuildings to the Rectory to get
 to the Church steps.Nowadays there is 
 an attractive pathway leading to the  
 Church.Recently a new extension to the
 Churchyard has been bought.
