     Hurlands farmhouse in Selham dates
 from 1529.    Mr.Cheal showed us round
 the buildings of this {350 acre  mixed
{farm.} There are 40 acres of{woodland,
 fields for  arable{crops}and {pastures
 for{130 dairy}&amp;{beef cattle. Pheasants
 are reared for the shooting season and
{trout }swim  in  the  Rother.  When we
 arrived the{Fresian cows}had just come
 in  for  milking  in  the  parlour. We
 walked  through  the  yard to see  the
 rearing sheds  and the winter barn for
 calving cows and older stock.{Four men
{work this farm; } when they are not in
 the fields you might find them mending
 implements in the workshop, collecting
 silage from the pit  or feeding hay to
 the cattle.  {Anna and Toni Cheal }and
 twins {Clint &amp; Jay Cobbold}live in the
 cottages and come to{Easebourne}in the
 school bus.                           </content>
