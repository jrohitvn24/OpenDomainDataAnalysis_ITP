		<title>12Bredon Hancocks School</title>
		<content> In 1718 Hancocks school was founded as
 a{Bluecoat school}for boys to be      
 educated to become apprentices.In 1870
 a law came in that everyone had to go 
 to school.So the school became a      
 Church of England School for boys.In  
 1932 the School became a{Senior       
{Elementary}for boys and girls over    
 11.They came from Eckington,Kemerton, 
 Conderton,Beckford,Ashton Under Hill  
 and of course Bredon.In 1944 the name 
 changed to a{Secondary Modern}School  
 but nothing else changed.In 1964 the  
 Secondary Modern moved to a bigger    
 bilding at Ashton and all the teachers
 and equipment moved too .Now Bredon   
 Hancocks was empty so the primary     
 school which was based farther up the 
 village moved in so the school which  
 was once a Bluecoat school was now a  
{primary school}for 5_11 years old.
