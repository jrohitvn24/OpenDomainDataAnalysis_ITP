		<title>16SHIRE HORSES - LICHFIELD</title>
		<content>  Shire horses are stabled at          
Birmingham Road, Lichfield. They are   
used for mainly promotional work for   
the Solid Fuel Advisory Service,       
although in the winter they do deliver 
coal for a local coal merchant.        
   There are six horses, four greys    
and two blacks, a staff of nine, all   
girls, exercise, groom, feed and clean 
the harness every day. The stables are 
open daily for visitors to see the     
horses, the harness and the vehicles   
they pull. They attend over 150        
promotions during the year, the main   
one being "The Horse of the Year Show" 
at Wembley. Regents park, London is    
visited at Easter and during Xmas,     
Father Xmas and the Shires are         
extremely busy. They have 2 weeks      
holiday in September when they are     
taken to a nearby farm, have their     
shoes taken off, and relax.            </content>
