		<title>11Pubs in Dargate and Blean</title>
		<content> Of the three public houses shown on   
 the map, the one at Denstroude is now 
 a dwelling house. The two remaining   
 are very different in character.      
 The Dove at Dargate changed hands in  
 recent years. It was a typical local  
 rural pub but has now developed s much
 wider clientel, which is suprising    
 considering its relatively isolated   
 position.  As well as its function as 
 a village local, food is served both  
 at lunchtime and in the evening.  The 
 regulars represent the pub in village 
 activities entering several teams in  
 the Hernhill Village Hall Annual quiz 
 in 1984.                              
 Morris men are regular visitors and   
 perform their dances in the road in   
 front of the Dove. The Tickham Hunt   
 and the Blean Beagles meet here       
 occasionally during the year.
