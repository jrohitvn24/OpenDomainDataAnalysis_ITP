		<content> The main feature of the block is its  
 rural nature.   The south and west are
 low lying and flat being part of the  
 River Humber flood plain, whilst to   
 the north east the land rises fairly  
 steeply up te scarp slope of the wolds
 from about 20m to 120m in the space of
 1km.  Away from the poorly drained    
 areas along the river's southerly     
 aspect, rich alluvium soil and the    
 drier chalk soils have given rise to  
 intensive horticulture and a variety  
 of high yield farm crops.             
 Passing through the block in a general
 east_west direction are the major     
 road, rail and river communications   
 from Hull.  The major residential area
 of Elloughton/Brough covering some    
 one and a half square kilometres is   
 centrally situated, whilst to the     
 east is the small village of Welton.
