		<title>14The Transport of Today.</title>
		<content>   Ever since the motor car came to    
 Britain it changed family             
 life.Before,then,people walked to     
 places and were late for work,or were 
 not in time for an appointment.       
   Now families can visit friends,drive
 to shops and go further afield for    
 their holidays.                       
   People can't go anywhere without    
 spending money on the car for petrol, 
 road tax and insurance.A driver must  
 have passed a test to drive alone.The 
 car must pass a test to make sure it  
 is roadworthy.It needs regular        
 servicing at a garage to ensure this. 
   A more economical form of transport 
 is the motor bike and some people     
 still ride bicycles!The lorry is used 
 to transport goods from place to      
 place.                                
   Other forms of transport used by the
 public are bus,rail and  air services.</content>
