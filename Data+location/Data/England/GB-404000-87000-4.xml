		<title>04Parkstone Golf Course</title>
		<content>    We found that the club was not     
 owned by one person but it was owned  
 by all the members.It is roughly sixty
 acres and originally belonged to the  
 late Lord Anridare.It used to be used 
 for pigeon shooting by the late Lord  
 and he used to invite his friends to  
 shoot.There are roughly one hundred   
 and fifty male members,seventy juniors
 and one hundred female members. There 
 are two large man made lakes. They    
 tried to breed trout but the golfers  
 used to bring their fishing rods. Soon
 there were no fish left. All a long   
 the edge of the golf course are fire  
 beaters just in case the golf course  
 should catch fire in the hot summers.
