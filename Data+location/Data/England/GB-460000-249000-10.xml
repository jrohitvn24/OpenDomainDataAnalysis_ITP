		<title>10Blakesley;A General Reveiw.</title>
		<content>The countryside of this area is        
pleasant farmland with gentle rolling  
arable land but black and white cows   
are still to be seen. In the centre of 
the area are the villages of Blakesley 
and Wood-End which are comprised       
largely of warm brown ironstone houses 
many dating back to the 17th Century.  
There has been a small amount of       
development which has blended in well  
with the local architecture and at the 
present time the population is about   
600.The village kept a rural identity  
in spite of limited development and the
fact that the majority of residents    
work outside the area.A visitor could  
well believe that time has stood still 
as the streets are quiet and peaceful.
