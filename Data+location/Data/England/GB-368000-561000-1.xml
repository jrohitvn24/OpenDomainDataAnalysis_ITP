		<content>    The area in our block is the land  
 south of the A69 and the western part 
 of the town of{Haltwhistle. }After the
 railway station was built in 1838, the
 old town around the Church and Market 
 Place grew towards the station.  As   
 Haltwhistle grew in size as a{coal    
{mining}town (there is now only one    
 small mine) terraced houses were      
 built in the west end of Haltwhistle. 
    The{Newcastle-Carlisle railway line
 and the{A69}run parallel to the{South 
{Tyne}River, and there is some factory 
 development in this area.  South of   
 the river is farmland, cultivated     
 grass-land in the valley bottom, rough
 grazing, fell and some woodland.  Most
 of the farms concentrate on stock     
 raising.  There are also two villages 
 - {Park Village and Plenmeller. }The  
 topics described have some connection 
 with the children in out school.      </content>
