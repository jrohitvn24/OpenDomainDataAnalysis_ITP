		<title>16BRASTED CHART</title>
		<content> The land of the Chart has been owned  
 by a succession of families. Brasted  
 people had rights of the common to    
 graze cattle and pigs, gather peat and
 firewood. In the Domesday book of 1086
 the manor of Brasted was recorded as  
 having "Wood for pannage for 20 hogs" 
 (i.e. 20 pigs were allowed to forage.)
 Although used a lot, the land has     
 probably never been ploughed. The hill
 must have been much less wooded when  
 it was a common.                      
 Now it is a wooded area where you can 
 see many different types of woodland  
 birds such as the robin, blackbird and
 wood pigeon. There are many kinds of  
 plants in the Chart and the hilltop   
 beechwood is an ideal place for       
 walking.
