		<content> post office and general store.Most    
 people who lived in the village used  
 to be employed by Parham Estate, The  
 Chalk Pits,The Castle Estate, and the 
 ten farms. Three main farms now       
 remain. Many retired people from these
 occupations still live in the village 
 but their children and                
 grandchildren have had to move away   
 because houses are very expensive and 
 there are now few local jobs. Most of 
 the estate and farm cottages have been
 sold to people who have retired,      
 commute or use the house as a second  
 home. People rely mainly on their cars
 for transport because the bus service 
 stopped in 1976 and the train service 
 keeps on being reduced. The railway   
 station is at Houghton and the service
 keeps on being reduced. Since the     
 ferry closed it is a 4 mile instead of
 1 mile journey between villages.      </content>
