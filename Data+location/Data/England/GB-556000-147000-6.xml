		<title>06TONBRIDGE THEATRE &amp; ARTS:1</title>
		<content>  The Tonbridge Theatre and Arts Club  
 is an amateur dramatics society,based 
 at the Oast.It is run by acting memb- 
 ers in their free time.Everything in  
 the theatre is done by unpaid volun-  
 teers,out of love.8 plays are produced
 each year for members and the general 
 public.Hard-working members of the    
 Oast feel justly proud of their ach-  
 ievement.This is the only theatre in  
 the area and the 112 seats are usually
 full throughout the 8 day run.They    
 provide local entertainment,which is  
 much appreciated in Tonbridge and Hil-
 denborough.There is also a youth sec- 
 tion which puts on 2-3 shows a year.  
  A local professional actress,who is a
 member,told us:"I don't think we could
 do much more,but we can do it for more
 people."Hence the plans for a Â£120,000
 extension,including a new foyer,bar,  
 lounge and dressing-rooms.            </content>
