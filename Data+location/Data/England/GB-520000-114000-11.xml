		<content>      Corpus Christi by Samuel.        
   The Church that I go to is Corpus   
 Christi.  It is a Roman Catholic      
 Church.  It is very modern being built
 in 1974.  It is an interesting though 
 small Church.  It can seat about      
 one hundred people.  The Church has a 
 wooden altar and it has eight altar   
 servers.  It has a big window of      
 stained glass at the back of it.  The 
 original church is used as a hall     
 which we go to after mass for coffee. 
  Rehoboth Baptist Chapel by Michelle. 
   The Chapel is quite small.  When you
 go in you go through a green door.  If
 you look straight ahead there is a big
 kind of box where the preacher stands.
 There are many long benches as well.  
 I go to Sunday School.  We pray.  Our 
 teacher talks about a story from the  
 Bible.  We sing.  We go to classes and
 have questions on the story.          </content>
