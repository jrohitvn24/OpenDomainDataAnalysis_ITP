		<title>20Coddenham Interesting Houses</title>
		<content> In Coddenham High St, the second of a 
 pair of large oak framed structures   
 dating fromthe late 15th century, was 
 the "Live and Let Live" Inn, later    
 converted to a private house with the 
 Post Office at one end and outstanding
 for broad geometrical pargetting of   
 the 17th Century. After passing a few 
 old cottages, there is an old         
 plastered and painted Inn. Opposite   
 the Inn and along the road are closely
 built cottages with painted plastered 
 walls. Towards the Church is a very   
 old timbered house associated once    
 with a religious order of Cistercian  
 or White Nuns. Next, a lively village 
 house of the Georgian or Regency      
 period. Opposite is the remaining wing
 of an attractive Tudor house. Lastly 4
 plastered cottages made into          
 residences in the mid 1800's from what
 is said to have been an old Maltings. </content>
