		<title>03ROYAL MAY DAY, KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>  The first May Day procession founded 
 by John Gledhill was in 1864.  Since  
 then there have been 110 Royal May    
 Queens.  For many years the choosing  
 of the May Queen was held at the Angel
 Hotel.  The choice is now made at the 
 Civic Hall.  The events of May Day    
 were first recorded by the Knutsford  
 Guardian in 1863.                     
  On the morning of the first Saturday 
 in May, words of blessing are printed 
 in sand on pavements in the town and  
 outside the Queen's house.  This has  
 been a tradition for many years.      
 Every May the fair comes to Knutsford.
  It is held on the big heath, which is
 where the May Day procession ends.    
 Here traditional dances are performed 
 in the presence of the May Queen      
 before she is crowned by the crown    
 bearer.
