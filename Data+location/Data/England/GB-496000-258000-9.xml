		<content> We surveyed 90 families and in three  
 of them the man had retired.  15      
 ladies worked full time and 42 had    
 part time jobs.  The men were lucky - 
 no one we spoke to was unemployed.    
 Many people showed concern for their  
 health &amp; fitness and 65% of our sample
 took part in sports activities; 80% of
 them played team games like hockey or 
 football.  Others preferred jogging,  
 squash or golf.  Apart from ice       
 skating and swimming, there are       
 facilities in Sharnbrook for most     
 sports activities.                    
 Only 30% of our sample attended       
 classes at the Sharnbrook Community   
 College either for recreational or    
 educational activities.               
 Young children are well provided with 
 clubs - many children are involved in 
 them for two or three evenings a week.
  There are youth clubs for teenagers. </content>
