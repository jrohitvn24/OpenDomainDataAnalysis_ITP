		<title>05POLICE STATION/FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>  Collier Row Police Station was built 
 in 1934. It is situated in Collier Row
 Lane and is central to shops and      
 schools, etc. The building was        
 intended as a public house!!          
  There are some women police officers 
 at the station. Women police          
 constables were first employed in     
 1914, when the men went off to war.   
 Policemen buy their own boots, but not
 their own uniform.                    
  Romford Fire Station is in Pettits   
 Lane North. 54 men work there in four 
 watches. They are called out to a     
 fire, on average, 35 times a week. The
 drill tower is 21 metres high. A      
 fire-engine is usually 6 metres long  
 and costs Â£55,000 without extras -    
 it's top speed is 70 miles per hour.  
 Each station is equipped with a       
 multi-gym, where the firemen keep fit.
