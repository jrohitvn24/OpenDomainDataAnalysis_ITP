		<content> against raiding parties from the      
 coast.                                
 Later the name becomes Leire or Leger 
 which means 'mud'. This is a          
 Scandinavian or Norse word and may    
 have been used to describe the soil   
 and the marsh_land around the village.
 By the time of the Norman Conquest    
 Layer was in use,which roughly        
 translated means 'owned by' and the   
 'de_la_Haye' was added when a member  
  of that family owned a substantial   
  amount of land.The de la Hayes were  
  generous benefactors of the          
 Abbey of St.John in Colchester and the
 monks from there took services in the 
 church.                               
 The plague of the fourteenth century, 
 known as the 'Black Death',decimated  
 the village and the church became     
 derelict until it was restored by the 
 monks.                                </content>
