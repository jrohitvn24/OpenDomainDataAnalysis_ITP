		<content>{Wilmslow County High opened in Sept.  
{1984.}It was an amalgamation of three 
 Wilmslow Schools,{Dean Row High,      
{Thorngrove High,}and{Harefield High.  
  The School has{2030 pupils,129 staff,
{12 ancilary staff and the Head        
{Mr.Greensmith.                        
  One of the disadvantages of such a   
 large school is the staff have to move
 from site to site.Eventually however  
 Thorngrove will become the lower      
 school and Harefield the upper        
 school.The pupils come from           
{Wilmslow,Alderley,Styal and part of   
{Handforth.                            
  The school uniform is maroon and grey
 and is worn by all except sixth       
 formers.                              
  There is a healthy sixth form.About  
 half take A Level courses,and a large 
 number of these go on to higher       
 education.All follow a general course.</content>
