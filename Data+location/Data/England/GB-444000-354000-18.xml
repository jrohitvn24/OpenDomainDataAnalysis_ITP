		<title>18RELIGION IN S.NORMANTON</title>
		<content>  The population in Pinxton and South  
 Normanton is 11,507.Our survey was    
 taken from 134 children in Pinxton    
 and 339 in South Normanton.Pinxton    
 has St Helens as its parish church    
 and  2 Methodist churches,one at      
 each end of the village.South         
 Normanton has St Michaels as its      
 parish church and 2 Methodist churches
 and an Assembly of God church.        
 63 children went to Sunday school most
 weeks but 105 had never been to a     
 service in any church.More than 50%   
 of children had been baptised but     
 the largest number of children had    
 attended a church for a marriage      
 service. We found a slightly higher   
 proportion of people went to church or
 chapel in South Normanton.But owing   
 to the geography of the village it was
 possible to live further away from    
 a place of worship than in Pinxton.   </content>
