		<title>16Townleys Farm</title>
		<content> The farms in our area are mainly dairy
 farms. Mr. Wildman is the tenant      
 farmer at Townleys Farm. He keeps 80  
 milking{cows}&amp; 60{calves}(mainly      
 friesians) and a few{beef cattle.}They
 produce 200 gallons of milk per day.  
 Milking times are at 7a.m. and again  
 at 5p.m. The machines in the milking  
 parlour milk 6 cows at a time. Paddy  
 the{bull}is very gentle and we could  
 stroke him. There are 400{pigs}in     
 various stages of growth. The oldest  
 weigh about 400kg and the smallest of 
 the{piglets}were 2 days old. They are 
 fed on pig swill which is a mash of   
 all kinds of waste food(including     
 school dinner leftovers). 800{hens}are
 kept in 2 chicken houses - it sounded 
 like sirens when we went in - and they
 each lay about 1 egg per day. There   
 were{dogs, cats &amp; ducks}in the yard.
