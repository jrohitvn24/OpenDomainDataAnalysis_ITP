		<title>12BOOKS ABOUT MIDHURST</title>
		<content> Mr.Vic Mitchell is a well known local 
 writer.The first book he wrote about  
 Midhurst was called "Branch Lines To  
 Midhurst."Since then he has written 13
 more books and says he may write more.
 When Mr.Mitchell writes a book he does
 not do it all by himself but he       
 collaborates with Keith Smith or his  
 wife Barbara Mitchell.Usually when    
 they write a book they use their      
 earlier books.The most difficult part 
 of the task is collecting the material
 and photographs.Mr.Mitchell gathers   
 his information from books and helpful
 people.It takes months to gather the  
 information and two weeks to write the
 book.They do not print their own      
 books.Most of the books have been     
 about local railway history but       
 Mr.Mitchell has also written "Midhurst
 Town-Then and Now.",a history of the  
 town which he believes will change.   </content>
