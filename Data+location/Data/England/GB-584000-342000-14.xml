		<title>14A WEEK-END AT OVERY</title>
		<content> One Saturday morning when I was       
 staying with my friend for the        
 week-end she took me to see her friend
 Zoe and we had dinner.  She then      
 showed me the marsh, creek and the    
 harbour.  We went to the playing field
 for a little while and then we went   
 home as it was getting dark.  I had   
 tea at their house, then we played and
 went to bed.  The next morning we went
 to get our boat ready for sailing in  
 the afternoon.  After dinner we went  
 with my friend's dad to go sailing.   
 We put on life jackets and went to    
 fetch the speed boat.  We had a ride  
 until dark.  We went home and had a   
 bath and had tea.  We played until my 
 mum and dad came and then we went to  
 fetch my sister from her friend's     
 house and we drove home.              
                                       
                                       </content>
