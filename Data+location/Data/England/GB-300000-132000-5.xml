 The area has no local schools. The    
 children of primary school age attend 
 Wheddon Cross Primary school situated 
 approximately 9 miles away.The        
 children have to be taken by car or   
 minibus every day. Older children may 
 attend Dulverton or Minehead middle   
 schools, both of which are a fair     
 distance away, going to the           
 comprehensive in Wiveliscombe at 11.  
 Some children attend private schools  
 in the County town, Taunton or in the 
 surrounding area. These schools are   
 over 20 miles away but are possible if
 transport can be provided.            
 Communications are poor in the area.  
 There is no bus service or railway at 
 all. Personal transport must be       
 provided in order to get anywhere.
