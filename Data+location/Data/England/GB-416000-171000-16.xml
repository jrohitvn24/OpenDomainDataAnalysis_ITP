		<title>16MOBILE LIBRARY IN OGBOURNE</title>
		<content> The{mobile library van}visits the     
 Ogbourne area fortnightly on Tuesdays 
 with 2500 books.Local people who have 
 signed an application card have access
 to the County's entire information    
 resources and may borrow unlimited    
 books within reason.Neighbours may    
 borrow for the housebound and there   
 are no fines for overdue books,but few
 go over the time limit.               
  The length of each of three stops    
 depends on the number of readers      
 served.Two stops have 10 minutes each 
 and 25 minutes is allowed for the stop
 serving 60 at the Junior School and   
 Liddiard's Green Estate.Here groups of
 16 children at a time,aged 7-11,select
 books or cassettes to improve reading.
 Both adults and children prefer paper_
 backs for their light weight.In the   
 event of delay or cancellation a local
 reader is notified by telephone.      </content>
