		<content> Harpers brook is a small brook. It is 
 shallow in most places but can be up  
 to five feet deep. It has much        
 vegetation on its steep banks. The    
 water is clear with a large population
 of fish which include                 
                                       
 pike,    brown trout,   rainbow trout,
 roach,   gudgeon,       dace          
 minnows, bullheads,     perch,        
 zander,  and chubb.                   
                                       
 These are fished by local fisherman.  
 The brook also has a wide range of    
 wildfowl living on it such as         
 ducks, moorhens and coots. Also mink  
 and stoats have been seen. Farther    
 down stream are man_made banks a weir 
 and a research station. This stream   
 often floods after long rain storms.
