		<title>07GRAVEL EXTRACTION: UPMINSTER</title>
		<content>  {Gravel extraction}in Havering is    
 concentrated in the south of the      
 Borough due to a belt of rich,fluvial 
 deposits laid down by the retreating  
 River Thames.The main Gravel workings 
 are in an{agricultural}area south of  
 Upminster and east of Rainham and     
 typical locations are Gerpins         
 Farm,Sullens Farm and Bush Farm.The   
 rich alluvial deposits have also      
 resulted in high grade agricultural   
 soil and many{conflicts}arise from the
 use of this for{Gravel extraction.    
{ Pollution}from noise and heavy       
 vehicles, and visual impact affects   
 the environment greatly,though some   
 landscaping does take place. However, 
 when extraction has finished, the pits
 are put to a variety of uses,such as  
 agriculture,recreation and refuse     
 tipping which takes place at{Gerpins  
{Lane. }                               </content>
