		<title>12Fruit Growing &amp; Harvesting.</title>
		<content>Fruit growing is a feature of the      
Goudhurst area. There are orchards of  
eating and cooking apples and pears,   
but cherries are no longer grown       
commercially here owing to the cost of 
labour for harvesting. Strawberries are
grown on a small scale mostly for local
and roadside sales, but the demands of 
markets in London is causing increased 
production. Blackcurrants &amp; redcurramts
are grown for market. The former are   
harvested by machine which means       
cutting the growing branches, but the  
reds are picked by hand because the    
fruits grow on second year wood. One   
farmer will grow blueberries next year-
an unusual fruit for English growers.  
The fruit harvesting provides useful   
income for the families where the wife 
can work and take the children too.    
Some farmers provide creches.
