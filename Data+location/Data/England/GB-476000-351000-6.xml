		<title>06My Mum's job in Newark</title>
		<content>    Mum's job is very tiring, she is a 
 nurse and sometimes she has to get up 
 at six o clock am. She has to have    
 a bath, put on her uniform and she    
 puts on a bit of make up on and she   
 does her hair with a hot brush.  At   
 about 6.45am she says good-bye and she
 goes to work.                         
 Sometimes she will go on her          
 bike or my dad will take her in the   
 car. She has got to be at the         
 hospital for 7am she  works at        
 Hawtonville hospital. It is not a     
 hospital for young people who come to 
 stay in the hospital for operations,  
 it is for old people who are there    
 permanently. There are a lot of       
 visitors who come. My mum likes her   
 work even though it is exhausting.
