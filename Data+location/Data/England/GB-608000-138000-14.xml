		<title>14School Holidays,Sellindge</title>
		<content> I am 11 years old,a boy,and live at   
 number 1 Whitehall Way,Sellindge.We   
 have six weeks holiday from school    
 every summer from late July until the 
 first week in September.My sister and 
 I have to go to my Nan's each weekday 
 because my parents both work from     
 9.00a.m. until 5.00p.m.As my Nan lives
 in the village,I can still go and play
 with my friends,so I usually go to    
 Stone Hill or up to Southernay Lane   
 where my friend Lee lives.His dad owns
 the village bakery and he has a big   
 garden but sometimes we go across the 
 fields to Mac's Farm.During the       
 summer,my parents have 2 weeks holiday
 when we usually go away to somewhere  
 like Brighton or have outings to      
 London or Beaulieu.I am lucky enough  
 to have a small swimming pool in my   
 garden and spend a lot of time in that
 when my parents are at home.          </content>
