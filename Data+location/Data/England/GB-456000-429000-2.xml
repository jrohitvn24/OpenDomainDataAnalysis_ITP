		<content> The Meat and Livestock Commission have
 two establishments in the area.  The  
 larger one is involved in research on 
 the content and quality of feed for   
 pigs and the smaller establishment    
 keeps sperm to be used for artificial 
 insemination.                         
                                       
{The Pig Progeny Testing Station}does  
 6-7 week tests - measuring the        
 quantity and composition of feed.  At 
 the end of this time half of the pigs 
 are slaughtered and tests are made on 
 their carcasses.  2500 pigs are taken 
 in per year.  There are 4 buildings   
 each holding 220 pigs.  A breeder     
 submits 4 pigs for testing (at Â£254   
 per test).  7 people are employed     
 here.
