		<title>15THE VILLAGE BUTCHER</title>
		<content> The butcher's shop has been there     
 since 1910.  Mr. Errett has been a    
 butcher for 35 years and has been in  
 Peaslake for 22 years.  The shop is   
 open at 9 a.m. each day except Friday 
 when it opens at 9.30 a.m.  It closes 
 at 12.30 on Monday and Saturday, at 5 
 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and at 4  
 p.m. on Wednesday. Mr. Errett has one 
 van. Beef and lamb come from Brighton 
 and pork from Horsham.  Chickens are  
 bought locally.  All this is delivered
 to the shop. Mr. Errett cuts up all   
 the meat himself. He has one helper.  
 He sells beef, pork, lamb, chicken and
 sausages. He sells more beef than     
 anything else. Each week he sells ten 
 sheep, two pigs and thirty chickens.  
 Most of his customers come from       
 Peaslake. Mr. Errett sells meat to    
 some schools.
