 Mrs.Blake met us and asked some       
 questions about crops.She picked wheat
 and barley for us to paint later. Mr. 
 Blake showed us around the barley     
 beef fattening unit and we saw calves 
 grouped according to size and         
 age. There was an enormous bull called
 Harpoon Stardom. We went to see the   
 Paschoe Oak which was mentioned in the
 Domesday Book and then we saw a large 
 badgers' set. We drove over to the    
 Dairy unit which has 150 cows and on  
 the way we stopped to see a field of  
 stubble turnips. Mrs. Blake said the  
 cows were giving about 2,500 litres a 
 day and they were milked at 6am and   
 3.30pm. All the new calves are        
 registered; have their markings       
 painted on special cards and are given
 their pedigree names.
