  The Harrowdens as they are known     
locally include the villages of Little 
and Great Harrowden.They are about five
kilometres outside the town of         
Wellingbrough surrounded by open       
countryside. The land is mainly        
agricultural farmland and much is used 
for the growing of cereal crops.However
some of the fields do have cattle and  
sheep grazing in them.                 
  Most of the people living in the     
villages travel outside the village to 
work.Wheatabix at Burton Latimer       
employs people from the Harrowdens and 
provides transport to and from work.   
There is a shoe factory in Little      
Harrowden that employs people from     
the village.When asked about the bus   
service many people said that it could 
not be relied upon.
