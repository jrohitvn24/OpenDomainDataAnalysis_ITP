		<title>05MODERN BUILDINGS IN SINFIN.</title>
		<content> We asked a builder how long it would  
 take to build a house.He said 9 days  
 and to build a house you need about 8 
 people.The main difficulty is bad     
 weather.He said it doesn't matter     
 which sort of land to build on.       
  The houses being built now are mostly
 detached and have two floors.Houses   
 are now being built with garages,but  
 no chimneys.The building company buys 
 the land and the architect designs the
 houses which the builders then build. 
 Then the joiners erect the roof and   
 put in the windows and doors.After    
 this the plumbers put in pipes for    
 water and heating and at the same time
 the electrician puts in the wiring and
 electric cables.Then the plasterer    
 plasters the walls.Houses are made of 
 brick,slate,concrete and wood with    
 plaster covering the inside walls.
