		<title>04INTRODUCING THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Dr. Barmby in his pamphlet "Pittington
 and its Church" conjectures that St.  
 Aidan may have visited this village   
 c.635 A.D.and to him or some of his   
 followers was probably due our        
 earliest church. When Bishop Carileph 
 began to re-build the Cathedral at    
 Durham in early Norman times he made a
 grant of these two Pittingtons to the 
 newly constituted Abbey, proving con- 
 clusively that Pittington was in      
 existence before Durham. Credit may   
 also be accorded to St. Aidan for the 
 first rudiments of learning coming to 
 this area as he and his followers were
 noted for their missionary work.      
   The dedication of the church to St. 
 Laurence suggests that a stone        
 building was erected later.           
   The foundations of the present      
 church were laid about 1070.
