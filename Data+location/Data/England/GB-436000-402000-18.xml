		<title>18YORKSHIRE TRACTION COMPANY</title>
		<content> THE BUS SERVICES IN OUR AREA ARE      
 PROVIDED MAINLY BY THE YORKSHIRE      
 TRACTION COMPANY AND WE FOUND THAT OUT
 OF THE 126 FAMILIES IN SCHOOL 6 MEN,  
 ALL DRIVERS, WORKED THERE. ALL BUSES  
 IN REGULAR USE USE THE BUS-WASH DAILY 
 AND THE INSIDES OF THE BUSES ARE SWEPT
 OUT EVERY NIGHT. THE EARLIEST BUS     
 THROUGH BANK END IS AT 7.OO A.M. AND  
 THE LAST ONE IS AT 1O.45 P.M. AT THE  
 MOMENT FARES ARE SUBSIDISED BY THE    
 SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL AND    
 THEY ARE PROBABLY THE LOWEST IN THE   
 COUNTRY, BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT HAS ITS
 WAY THIS CHARGE ON THE RATES WILL BE  
 STOPPED AND THEN FARES COULD RISE FOUR
 OR FIVE TIMES WHAT THEY ARE NOW. THE  
 Y.T.C. HAS 3O COACHES, 15O SINGLE     
 DECKERS AND 15O DOUBLE DECKERS. THEY  
 HAVE A LIFE OF ABOUT 13 YEARS BUT THEY
 STILL RUN ONE BUS WHICH IS 5O YEARS   
 OLD AND IT MAY BE HIRED OUT.          </content>
