		<title>01STRATFORD ON AVON(SOUTH)</title>
		<content> With the exception of London itself,  
 Stratford is probably the best known  
 town in England.William Shakespeare's 
 life in Stratford certainly accounts  
 for a great deal of its popularity but
 it is also a beautiful and picturesque
 town in its own right .Stratford is   
 still in many ways ,the tidy Tudor    
 town it once was,interspersed with    
 cafes,modern restaurants and 20th     
 century shopping facilities.New, has  
 been skillfully and gracefully blended
 with old resulting in a town full of  
 character but surrounded by modern    
 residential development .The River    
 Avon runs through the south of        
 Stratford and the rolling, peaceful   
 countryside dotted with small villages
 Land is intensively farmed with a     
 mixture of arable and dairy farming   
 but there is also a large amount of   
 market gardening in the area.         </content>
