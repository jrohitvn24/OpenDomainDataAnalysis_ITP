		<title>19HULL SCHOOLS' REORGANISATION</title>
		<content>      The Hull division of the         
 Humberside Education Authority has    
 been given approval by the Secretary  
 of State to reorganise the school     
 system within the city.   A fall in   
 the birth rate during the last two    
 decades has meant that the city's     
 senior high schools have too few      
 children.                             
      The present system involves      
 children attending primary school from
 the age of five to the age of nine,   
 middle school from nine to thirteen   
 and senior high school from thirteen  
 to sixteen, with an option to         
 continue in the Sixth Forms up to     
 the age of eighteen.                  
      The new system will abolish      
 middle schools, creating a three tier 
 system - five to eleven, eleven to    
 sixteen and new Sixth form Colleges.
