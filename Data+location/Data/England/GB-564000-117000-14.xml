		<title>14ROAD WORKS</title>
		<content> During the middle of May 1985 the     
 council had to rebuild the road in    
 Dallington street,because of effect of
 the hard winter.It is the first time  
 that this method of road repair has   
 been used in the British Isles on a   
 public road.The work was very         
 succesful altough it only took 5      
 daysto complete.(Normally it would    
 taken 3-4 weeks.)The materials used   
 were chopped up glass fibre,stone     
 chippings(6mm),clay,surface           
 dressing,biton and insulation.The cost
 was estimated at Â£19,000.Only 15 men  
 were involved.The vehicles involved   
 were 2 types of rotovater,one was     
 called the bomag MPH100,grader,roller,
 cement layer and the tar lorry.They   
 had to repair 2960 square metres of   
 road.The work hours were between 8-12 
 perday.
