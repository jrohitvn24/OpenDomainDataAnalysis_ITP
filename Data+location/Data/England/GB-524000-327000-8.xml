		<title>08Scaring the birds.</title>
		<content>      "Sole Concessionaire" runs the   
 proud boast of the Exid firm run by   
 Grant and Carter providing a service  
 and supply of gas bird scarers of     
 several kinds.                        
      Made in Belgium,the bird scarers 
 are imported here and supplied via    
 1000 agents to clients on farms all   
 over the country.  Parcels go out of  
 the little factory to Canada,Australia
 New Zealand and many other countries. 
      The scarers are gas-operated and 
 cost about Â£150 each.  Propane gas is 
 used to ensure an efficient machine   
 and the firm guarantee 100% sucess    
 especially with the "multibang" scarer
 which fools the birds completely.     
      The most expensive scarer fires  
 off in a different direction each     
 time.  Sometimes, scarers have to be  
 returned for repair, possibly after   
 catching fire.                        </content>
