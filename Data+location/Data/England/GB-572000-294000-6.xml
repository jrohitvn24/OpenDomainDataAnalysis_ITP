		<content> Brookville is two kilometres from     
 Methwold.It is a bit too far for the  
 young children to walk to school,so   
 they travel by bus or car.Out of 126  
 children at Methwold Primary school 21
 live in Brookville.The main road from 
 Methwold to Stoke Ferry runs though   
 Brookville and there are four lanes   
 leading off it.The lanes are called   
 "The Avenue","Scotts Lane", "Brook    
 Lane" and "Holders Lane".             
    The only shop in Brookville is a   
 small post office and general         
 store,but there is also a transport   
 cafe.There is a Market Garden in      
 Brookville,growing mainly             
 tomatoes,cucumbers,lettuces and       
 peppers,and they supply many of the   
 local shops.Most of the inhabitants of
 Brookville are either self-employed or
 work in Methwold.
