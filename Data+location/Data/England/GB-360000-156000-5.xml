		<title>05Temple Cloud+Knights Templar</title>
		<content> The growth of Temple Cloud was        
 stimulated by the turnpiking of the   
 Bristol Road in the mid-18th century. 
 But its name suggests a more romantic 
 cause for its original development.   
 Locally two stories are told about its
 foundation.It is suggested that the   
 village was the site of a Roman       
 temple.Alternatively 'Temple' refers  
 to the Knights Templar while 'Cloud'  
 means 'hill' or 'quarry'.Writing in   
 the 'Bristol Evening World' of Sept.  
 20 1952 Gray Usher,a Local Historian, 
 described an outbuilding at Manor     
 Farm,Temple Cloud,as being a Commandry
 of Knights Templar.                   
 The story about a Roman Temple has    
 been largely discredited,but an       
 association with the excommunicated   
 Knights Templar remains an intriguing 
 possibility.                          
                                       </content>
