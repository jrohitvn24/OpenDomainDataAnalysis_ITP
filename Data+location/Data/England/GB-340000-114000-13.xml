		<title>13THE FOLK FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> In June every year on the 15th 16th   
 and 17th there is a Folk Festival.My  
 dad helps, also my mum does some      
 stewarding.Sometimes or rather for the
 last 2 or 3 years I have been helping 
 to put up the bunting I also help to  
 sell  the programmes,which are being  
 sold for 35p.The Folk Festival is an  
 exciting time for the people that     
 come,and also for the local village   
 people.There are lots of activities   
 during the weekend and plenty of      
 things for children to do. At night   
 there are concerts and ceilidhs. The  
 trouble is there are lots of things   
 going at once so you can't go to all  
 of the activities.For younger children
 there are dances and songs; face      
 painting, clowns and puppets. The boys
 from our school do displays of sword  
 dancing. Morris men and other dancers 
 perform in the square.                </content>
