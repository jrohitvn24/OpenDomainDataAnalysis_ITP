		<content>   {SPONSORED WALK}                    
   We hold the sponsored walk in the   
 summer. It is a way of raising money  
 for the school funds. All the children
 have a sponsor sheet for the names of 
 the people who pledge money for every 
 lap completed of the walk. We walk    
 around the school field as many times 
 as possible. We have free drinks and  
 ice-cream afterwards. The laps are    
 counted then we go and collect in the 
 money owed.                           
    {SCHOOL PLAY}                      
   Each year the teachers help the     
 children put on some entertainment for
 the community. It can be a play where 
 we act a story, or it can be a musical
 entertainment. We try to let the whole
 school take part. We like to dress up 
 in costumes.
