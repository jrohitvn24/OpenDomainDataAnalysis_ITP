		<content> In school you learn alot of things.I  
 like school,my teacher.Mr.Hamill takes
 us to the baths on Tuesdays.We all    
 like going to the baths because it is 
 a break from working.We go to Weston  
 Point School.I have got four brothers 
 and three sisters.We do different     
 things at school,like                 
 maths,English,spellings,Topic,and     
 Stories and Poems.I like maths the    
 best because I like doing cards,also  
 it is because it has time tables on   
 the cards sometimes.My friend Lisa    
 Wilkes likes English the best,because 
 she likes the work in it.My friend    
 Louise likes Stories And Poems the    
 best because she likes making         
 Poems.Two of my brothers are in my    
 school,one of my brothers are in      
 another school with my two            
 sisters.One of my brothers and sisters
 have left school.                     </content>
