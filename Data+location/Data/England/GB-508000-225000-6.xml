		<content> WE AT{WARDEN HILL}ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS
 OF{LUTON}IN AN URBAN AREA.WE HAVE BEEN
 DOING A SURVEY ON THE HOUSING HERE.  }
    WE FOUND OUT THAT MOST PEOPLE LIVE 
 IN A SEMI-DETATCHED HOUSE,NEXT CAME   
 TERRACED,THEN DETATCHED,THEN BUNGALOWS
 AND FINALLY CHALET BUNGALOWS.IN THESE 
 HOUSES THE MOST POPULAR NUMBER OF     
 BEDROOMS ARE THREE.                   
   MOST PEOPLE HAVE LIVED HERE FROM ONE
 TO FIVE YEARS.THIS IS BECAUSE OF THREE
 NEW ESTATES IN OUR AREA.              
   A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOT GOT        
 CONSERVATORIES OR EXTENSIONS.         
  MOST PEOPLE HAVE GARAGES,BUT MANY    
 PEOPLE IN TERRACED HOUSES DO NOT.     
  FOR HEATING MOST PEOPLE HAD GAS      
 RADIATOR CENTRAL HEATING BACKED UP    
 BY GAS FIRES.NEARLY EVERYONE HAD LOFT 
 INSULATION.BUT ONLY A THIRD OF THOSE  
 SURVEYED HAD DOUBLE GLAZING AND CAVITY
 WALL INSULATION.                      </content>
