		<title>18The Bishop of Guyana</title>
		<content>   On the l8th July the Bishop of      
 Guyana came to our school.  He looked 
 round the school and talked to us. He 
 had coffee with the teachers.  He told
 us what it was like in Guyana.  He    
 said that we were very lucky to have a
 lovely school like ours.              
   Some of us went to see him at The   
 Barn in the night.  We saw some slides
 of Guyana and we had lots of things to
 eat.  The grown ups had wine.  We had 
 orange.                               
   The Bishop was a very nice man.
