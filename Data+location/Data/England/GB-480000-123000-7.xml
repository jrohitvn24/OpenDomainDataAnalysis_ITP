		<content>   The beer is made with male hops from
 Kent and Herefordshire.Water, barley  
 and malted yeast is added but no other
 secret ingredients.                   
    All this is boiled up in a large   
 tub, before being put through a sieve 
 or strainer. The debris is sold off by
 the sack full for garden use. The     
 liquid then spends the next five days 
 in a cooler. This fermentation vessel 
 can hold 300 gallons. When ready the  
 beer is put into casks which are      
 called Pin for half a gallon or Firkin
 9 gallons or Kilderkin 18 gallons. The
 Firkin costs Â£60 and the Kilderkin Â£90
 to buy.                               
    Customs and Excise officers        
 regularly inspect the brewing process 
 to check on the amount being made and 
 the strength of the alcohol. They     
 sometimes visit at night  as they     
 have a key.                           </content>
