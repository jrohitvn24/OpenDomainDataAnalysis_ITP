		<title>10THE TOWNHEAD PENRITH</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Townhead is one long narrow street
 that leads from the Centre of Penrith 
 to the outlying housing estates on    
 the northern edge of the Town.These   
 are some of the estates Voreda Park,  
 Raislands Croft, Monks Close and Penny
 Hill Park.Penrith has long had        
 connections with Road Transport and   
 there are a number of Garages serving 
 this Industry.From the youngster's    
 point of view it is very interesting  
 up Macdam Way because we play Hounds &amp;
 Hares:and you play it like this:you   
 get 5 boys and 5 girls,the girls run  
 away and the boys come after the      
 girls.And when they catch us they tig 
 us three times.Then we chase them and 
 tig them three times.That is what     
 Hounds and Hares is.We have two swings
 across the road.
