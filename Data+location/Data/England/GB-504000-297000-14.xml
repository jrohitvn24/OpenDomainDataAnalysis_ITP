		<title>14RIVER NENE AT WANSFORD</title>
		<content>  The bridge is very long at Wansford  
 because it has to cross both the      
 river and its marshy flood            
 plain. Wansford was chosen as a bridge
 point because the river is quite      
 narrow here.  At the bridge the       
 Nene is 8.8 metres wide. Elsewhere it 
 is over 15 metres wide.               
  The speed of the river is 0.29 metres
 per second although it is slower at   
 the edges.  This speed prevents the   
 river silting up. The depth of the    
 river is 3.8 metres, allowing boats to
 use it.  If the river was not deep the
 boats would not be there.  Also many  
 fishermen come to Wansford to fish.   
 Along the banks of the river there    
 are foot-paths but fields and houses  
 face on to the river also.
