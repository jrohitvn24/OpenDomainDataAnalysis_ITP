		<content> Stamford played little part in the    
 industrial expansion of the Victorian 
 age. There were however, some         
 factories, among them an agricultural 
 equipment manufacturers,electrical    
 equipment and industrial equipment    
 factories, but these were sited away  
 from the centre of the town, so their 
 presence (and employment) did not     
 detract from the beauty of the town.  
 Much industry was sited along the     
 railway to Essendine (linking with    
 GNR). The main reason for the lack of 
 industry in the town was the fact that
 the Great Northern Railway did not    
 pass through the town, instead going  
 through nearby Peterborough, which is 
 now a major industrial and population 
 centre. One major employer in Stamford
 today is Mirrlees Blackstones, engine 
 manufacturers, who employ around 700  
 people.                               </content>
