 In our school, Wiveliscombe Primary   
 School,we have 200 children aged from 
 four to eleven. There are 7 classes   
 and 7 teachers, plus a headmaster. Our
 school is over a hundred years old. We
 have our television room in the old   
 headmaster's house, and the staff room
 is in there as well .                 
                                       
 We have clubs at dinner times, and we 
 have clubs for all the classes on a   
 Friday afternoon, with parents        
 helping. We have a school radio       
 station called "Radio Wivey" which    
 broadcasts stories, news,             
 competitions, etc. on Friday mornings.
                                       
 This year we built a pond and a       
 conservation area. It already has many
 plants and animals in there.
