		<title>18MY DAY- IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  "Have a good day!" says Mum but I    
 don't know why because I hardly ever  
 do.Down the road, through the alley,  
 round the corner.Put my coat and bags 
 on the peg outside and wait for my    
 friend. At 9.00 it's registration and 
 then the Recorder groups have their   
 lesson and practice "Captain Noah" for
 the concert. Next is Language, "On    
 Target"-ugh, I hate it.Break at 10.30 
 and play "1,2,3 in".Now it's Project, 
 I'm making a book about me!           
  Lunch was sausages, chips and salad  
 followed by iced sponge and more      
 "1,2,3 in". It's near the concert so  
 we have a whole class practice of     
 "Capt. Noah" and that is followed by  
 Games.Today my group have tennis with 
 a teacher and a parent helping us. I  
 hate tennis- I'm no good at it!Next   
 week it should be Rounders.
