		<title>03THE CANAL  ELLAND</title>
		<content> The canal was started by John Smeaton 
 who constructed a 'cut' from the river
 near West Vale to the Elland weir in  
 1757.   This was extended and the     
 whole canal was completed by 1808.    
 By 1813 a wharf was built and the     
 bridge was extended to cross the      
 canal. By 1830 Wharfe House was built 
 and the canal was at its peak for     
 trade.  This year, 1985, there have   
 been renovations along the canal and  
 perhaps it will again enjoy a busy    
 time with pleasure boats instead of   
 barges.
