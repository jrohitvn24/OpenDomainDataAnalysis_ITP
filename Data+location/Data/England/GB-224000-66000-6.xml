		<content>   There are four jars to show the four
 different stages of purifying water in
 the Reception. First we went outside  
 to see the water tanks. The water     
 comes from the River Fowey at Trekeive
 Steps and is pumped up into the tanks:
 there were 24 tanks altogether;none of
 which were full. After that we went to
 the control rooms where there were    
 four controls, one for each main tank.
 We watched the sand and gravel start  
 to clean the water.This is called     
 rapid gravity filtration. Chlorine is 
 then added to the water in controlled 
 amounts and whenever it is used the   
 workmen have to wear protective       
 clothing. Lime is also used to purify 
 the water so that when you wash your  
 knives and forks they do not turn     
 black. It also sweetens the water. The
 best bit was seeing the container of  
 lime _ it held 80,000 gallons.        </content>
