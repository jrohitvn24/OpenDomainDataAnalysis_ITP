		<content>  Country sports play a great part in  
 the recreational facility of the area.
 The Grove and Rufford Hunt regularly  
 use the land as they pursue their     
 quarry.No great opposition to fox     
 hunting exists and relations with the 
 hunt are good.The hunt dogs are kept  
 at Barnby Moor Kennels.               
  Pheasant and partridges are bred as  
 game birds and then left to populate  
 the woods and fields.Organized shoot  
 take place during the shooting        
 season.Any pests are also shot,for    
 example,rabbit,foxes and pigeons.     
 Many bridal paths and public footpaths
 criss cross the area and are regularly
 trod by enthusiastic ramblers and     
 horse riders.The local rambling club  
 ensures that these paths are kept open
 by arranging regular vigilante walks. 
 Orienteering occasionally takes place 
 in the nearby forests.                </content>
