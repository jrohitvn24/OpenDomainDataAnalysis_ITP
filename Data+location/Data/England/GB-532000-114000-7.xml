		<title>07Early Schooling in Ditchling</title>
		<content> The Ditchling Toddler Group for the   
 under 5's meets twice a week and is an
 opportunity for the young mums to     
 share experiences over coffee whilst  
 their children explore a variety of   
 simple puzzles,rag_books and brightly 
 coloured toys.The confidence the      
 children gain here makes the          
 transition to the infant department of
 St. Margaret's C.E.Primary School much
 less traumatic.This new school in the 
 centre of Ditchling won a National    
 Design Award amd provides an          
 attractive environment for learning.  
 Large airy classrooms,a soundproof    
 room for rowdy activities plus teach_ 
 ing aids including computers,video and
 television combine to make the six    
 years of Primary schooling profitable 
 ones.At the age of 11 most of the     
 children complete their schooling at  
 Lewes Priory Comprehensive School.    </content>
