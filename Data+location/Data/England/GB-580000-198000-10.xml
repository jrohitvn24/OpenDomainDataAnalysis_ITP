		<content>    The most conspicious land-mark in  
 the whole of our area is{Marconi Radar
 on Bushy Hill. It can be seen from    
 Christian's bedroom, Stow Maries      
 church and our school playground.     
    After our teachers had signed in,  
 Mr Powell showed our school party all 
 the equipment used on this testing    
 ground.                               
    On the site there are radars from  
 the 2nd World War up to the most      
 modern cylindrical radar used on      
 ships. The most impressive has a huge 
 bowl and can pick up signals from     
 aircraft 100 miles away.              
    Inside the buildings was the       
 equipment used to motivate the radar  
 and five scanners which show the      
 signals on a screen. A special pen    
 placed over these signals showed the  
 height of the aircraft and their      
 flight numbers.                       </content>
