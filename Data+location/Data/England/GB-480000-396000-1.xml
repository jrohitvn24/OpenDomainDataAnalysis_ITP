		<content> This block of land lies betwen the    
 river Trent and Laughton. Running     
 south to north in the west of the     
 block is the trent, a tidal river used
 regularly by small coasters and       
 barges. Most of the land is arable,   
 very flat and low near to River level.
 Drainage and pumping are needed to    
 prevent flooding. Crops are mostly    
 cereal and root crops. There is no    
 sign of livestock.  The east side is  
 coniferous forest for timber          
 production. These are maintined by the
 forestry commission.  The area is     
 sparsely populated. Wildsworth        
 village has less than 50 inhabitants. 
 There are three farms with cottages   
 nearby and other small cottage around 
 the forest areas.  Most residents in  
 the area are local born and bred,     
 although not all work the land, many  
 have connections with farming         </content>
