		<title>05Beswick: Work Opportunities</title>
		<content> Apart from agriculture, with its now  
 limited employment opportunities,     
 there is little scope for employment  
 within the area. Around one-fifth of  
 the population are children; and of   
 the adult population a high proportion
 are pensioners. Of the working        
 population relatively few are actually
 employed within the designated region.
 Several "commuter" families reside in 
 the area, travelling to work in       
 Beverley, Hull, Driffield or          
 Bridlington.                          
 Local businesses include joinery and  
 undertaking, building services and    
 motor vehicle repairs. These are      
 one-man or family concerns, casual    
 local labour occasionally being used. 
 Most female employment is part-time in
 nature - domestic cleaning, ancillary 
 school-work or shop-work. Beswick post
 office also provides part-time work.  </content>
