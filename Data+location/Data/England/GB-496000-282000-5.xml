		<content> Sudborough riding school has been open
 for eight years,since 1977. The riding
 school has 25 horses and ponies       
 including one in retirement. These    
 horses are ridden by both the young   
 and the old, and also by the R.D.A.   
 (Riding for the Disabled). Once a year
 in the summer under privileged        
 students from the east end of London  
 come to the school to ride. These     
 people pay special fees.              
 The fees at the riding school are :   
    Teaching lessons Â£5 per hour       
    Riding out Â£6 per 1\ hours         
 There is also a new indoor riding     
 centre.The staff at the school totals 
 approximately 18 including some part- 
 timers who sometimes work for their   
 lessons.
