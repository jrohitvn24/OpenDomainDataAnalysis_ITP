		<title>11FARMING (cont)</title>
		<content> have introduced milk quotas into the  
 country.One farm we saw had           
 computerised the milking parlour and  
 the feeding systems and had employed a
 heat transfer system on the cooling   
 tank for the milk.The EEC has also    
 meant that the farms can always sell  
 their milk to somebody at a set price.
 Most farmers use this as an easy way  
 to sell their milk, although the      
 selling price may not be as high as if
 they were to obtain a private contract
 from a company.Income is not very high
 for the area and one farmer earned    
 below Â£5,000 a year;others are better 
 off.                                  
 In our area there are many hedges and 
 there is not a tendancy for farmers to
 remove them as in other areas.The     
 average anual rainfall is around      
 700mm. per year.Soils are good.
