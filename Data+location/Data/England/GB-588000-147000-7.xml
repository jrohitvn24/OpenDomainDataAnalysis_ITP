		<content>   The Church of St James, with its 100
 ft tower and 6 bells, dominates the   
 village of Egerton.  It dates from the
 C13, C14 and C15 and examples of each 
 period of architecture can be seen.   
 St. James's is the first church known 
 to have an organ in England, dating   
 from 1531, and the church continues   
 its fine traditions of music and      
 singing to the present day.           
   There is a magnificent collection of
 ancient church plate and many gifts to
 the church have been made by          
 parishioners throughout the ages.  The
 500 yr old stone font lies in the     
 church beneath the tower.             
   Up until the Reformation the church 
 was called the Blessed Mary at        
 Egerton. Now as St James, it is in the
 patronage of the Dean and Chapter of  
 St Paul's who have helped considerably
 in the cost of extensive renovations. </content>
