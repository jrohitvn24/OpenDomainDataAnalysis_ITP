		<content> The twin villages of Burston and      
 shimplig lie amist open and           
 uninspiring agricultural land, broken 
 only by the Norwich-London railway and
 the CEGB's national grid both running 
 north/south.  Burston is centred on   
 its village green, church, chapel,    
 shop, school, public house, and       
 nationally famouse stribe school,     
 Shimpling is miniscule - its church is
 being declared redundant, but will be 
 preserved being of national           
 architectural interest. whilst few    
 individuals are directly employed in  
 agriculture, Burston has the          
 headquarters of a major family animal 
 feedstufs manufacturer providing      
 employment for 200 people.  Local     
 employment opportunities are also     
 provided by a home and school for     
 mentally handicapped childredn.       
 Others are employed in service        </content>
