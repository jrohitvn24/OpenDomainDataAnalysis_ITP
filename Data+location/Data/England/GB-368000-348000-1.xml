		<title>01Wybunbury Village and Area</title>
		<content>  Recently, the village of Wybunbury   
 has increased in size, due to private 
 housing development, which has now    
 finished.No further plans are at      
 present under consideration.          
                                       
  The neighbouring village of Hough is 
 however expanding, and there are to be
 about 250 new dwellings built.        
                                       
  Wybunbury is of linear development   
 along the B5071. The main development 
 of the village was of houses built    
 mainly during the Georgian period,    
 with more rapid growth during the     
 Victorian era due to the proximity of 
 Crewe railway works.Thus, the         
 architecture of the village is a      
 mixture of Elizabethan, Georgian,     
 Victorian and modern (1980-1985)      
 design.A new, modern-style Church has 
 recently been completed.              </content>
