		<title>02GOOSTREY VILLAGE - HOUSING</title>
		<content> Goostrey village dates from an early  
 age and is mentioned in the Domesday  
 book, when it was spelt "Gostre". Some
 old buildings still exist particularly
 along the main road, but much of the  
 village dates from the late 1960s and 
 1970s, when many new houses were      
 built.                                
                                       
 Expansion of the village has been     
 strictly controlled because of the    
 proximity to Jodrell Bank telescope.  
                                       
 There is a considerable amount of     
 movement of families in and out of the
 village. Although many of the houses  
 are only 10 to 15 years old the       
 present occupants may well be the     
 third or fourth family to live there.
