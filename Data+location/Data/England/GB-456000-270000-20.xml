		<content>  Electricity comes to our villages    
 through pylons which are tall steel   
 giants striding over the land.        
 Telegraph poles are supports that     
 carry telephone wires to our homes so 
 we can communicate with people all    
 over the world.18 wooden telegraph    
 poles can be seen from Crick School   
 grounds.The electricity pylons carry  
 electricity to our homes so that we   
 can have hot water,use washing        
 machines,cookers,fridges,kettles,     
 radios.lights,televisions,videos,     
 computers etc. We tend to take        
 electricity for granted these days,   
 but 160 yrs ago people would have had 
 no vision of how it could have changed
 their life to make it easier. One     
 example- we can now sit at home in    
 Crick and watch what is happening in  
 Africa, Australia etc.
