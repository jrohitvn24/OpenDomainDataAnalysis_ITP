		<title>06TRANSPORT IN SUNNINGDALE</title>
		<content> Local people look back fondly to the  
 days when public transport cost very  
 little.Even so,there were less cars   
 than nowadays and people often walked 
 to wherever they were going.Fifty     
 years ago the original station still  
 existed.It was made of brick and had a
 booking-office,parcels room,2 waiting 
 rooms with fires in the winter and a  
 station masters house which had a well
 kept garden and was on the 'upside!'  
 The present flat-roofed booking office
 is not as attractive and nearly always
 has a puddle of water on top.The area 
 where the garden used to be has become
 an informal rubbish dump and the old  
 sidings are now a car park.The new    
 automatic level crossing seems to hold
 traffic up longer than the old ones   
 but this may be because there is now  
 more traffic commuting from these     
 'rurbian' dormitories to London.      </content>
