		<title>07Wimborne Today by a teenager</title>
		<content> A teenager (l8 years old) was asked   
 some questions by a group of 8/9 year 
 old children about living in the      
 Wimborne area.  She told us that she  
 liked the area very much because it   
 was near the country and the sea.She  
 liked Wimborne because there were lots
 of interesting places to visit such as
 the Minster and the Priests House     
 Museum.  She said the town was not too
 large and the new houses being built  
 blended in well with the old.  She    
 said the shopping facilities in       
 Wimborne could be improved, but it    
 wasn't far to travel to Poole or      
 Bournemouth to get a better selection 
 of shops.  In her spare time she found
 plenty to do in the area - tennis,    
 badminton and riding, and went to a   
 Youth Club at the Methodist Church    
 every Thursday evening.
