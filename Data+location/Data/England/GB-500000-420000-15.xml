		<content>   In 1975 comprehensive{education}was 
 introduced in Barton.This was achieved
 by joining together Beretun Secondary 
 school on Barrow Road with the Barton 
 Grammar School on Caistor Road.       
   The new school caters for the       
 children of Barton and the surrounding
 villages from the ages of 11 to 18.   
   The school is housed in two sets of 
 buildings separated by a playing field
 but linked by a tarmac path.          
   The school is organised into 6      
 houses and has extensive facilities   
 including a sports hall and drama     
 studio.                               
   The size of the school in 1985 was  
 1350 pupils and approx.88 staff       
 although the fall in school population
 has led to the loss of Bardney house  
 in 1985 the first headmaster,R.N      
 Smithson,retired at the end of 1985.
