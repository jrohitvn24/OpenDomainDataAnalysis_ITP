		<title>13THE RIFLE RANGE: GRAVESHAM</title>
		<content> When we arrived at the{Denton Rifle   
{Range}we had a look at all the targets
 which are used for practice. We saw a 
 flag which was down. It meant that    
 soldiers were not firing that day and 
 so it was safe to visit. Then we set  
 off in groups of 3 - 5.  We found most
 interesting things, like dragonfly    
 larvae and mating moths. We saw       
 machines which lifted the targets     
 upwards so the soldiers can shoot at  
 them. The targets look like men. The  
 soldiers pretend that they are their  
 enemies and they fire at them. The    
 used targets all had holes in them.   
 The Warden, Alan said that the bullets
 could travel up to four miles. We     
 found some used bullets and took them 
 to our group leader to make sure they 
 were not live!
