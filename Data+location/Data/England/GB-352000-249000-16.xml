 There are 20 bungalows for Bodenhams  
 Senior Citizens, 1 wardens flat and a 
 community centre. The properties are  
 owned by the Siward James Charity and 
 were built 16 years ago. The managers 
 are trustees of the Siward James      
 Charity.                              
 24 people live in the bungalows and 2 
 live in the wardens flat. The warden  
 looks after the welfare of the        
 residents and is there to answer any  
 emergencies.                          
  The grassed area within the close is 
 the site of the church fete and the   
 bowling club have their bowling green 
 here.                                 
 The bungalows are in a central        
 position, in a flat area and the      
 residents are within easy walking     
 distance of the shops and bus route.  </content>
