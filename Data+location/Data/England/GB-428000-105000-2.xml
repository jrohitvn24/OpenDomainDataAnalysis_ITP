		<title>02Waverley Farm</title>
		<content> Waverley farm is situated 1km. S.W. of
 Lyndhurst.   It covers 162.8 hectares.
   The farm is managed by Mr.Smith, but
 owned by a London - based company.    
  Mr.Smith concentrates on dairy       
 farming, owning 155 Friesians.   His  
 land is used mainly for intensive     
 grazing, but there is 1 field of maize
 which provides fodder for cattle.     
  The soils range from heavy clay to   
 gravel, sand &amp; peat.   Drainage proves
 to be an expensive problem, because   
 where 2 different soils meet, water   
 has collected to form springs.        
  The relief is undulating and the land
 cover consists of wide open fields    
 surrounded by many deciduous trees.   
  There are 5 tractors on the farm,    
 ranging from 30h.p. to 100h.p.        
 Mr.Smith has two labourers to help him
 run the farm.
