		<content>  During the last war Canadian Soldiers
were billeted in the area particularly 
before the Normandy landings.          
  A village clubhouse was opened in    
1924, for the benefit of the villagers.
  Before the war a fisherman walked    
over the Downs from Brighton to sell   
his catch. Also travelling shops used  
to visit the village each week.        
  Earl Haig planted a beech tree at the
bottom of the hill.                    
  During the war a Radar Station was on
the Downs outside the village.         
  Telscombe still has no pub or shop.  
Every bank is planted with millions    
of Daffodil bulbs making the village a 
beautiful vision each spring.          
  Around the village is the 'Tye' a    
piece of common land still used to     
graze sheep.                           
  There is little parking space in the 
narrow lane known as the 'High Street' </content>
