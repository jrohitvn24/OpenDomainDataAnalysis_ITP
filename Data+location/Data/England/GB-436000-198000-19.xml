		<title>19Employment around Longworth</title>
		<content>There are not many jobs in Longworth so
a lot of people have to go to work in  
Abingdon, Oxford or Faringdon.         
 There are a few people who help in the
shop and some work in the pubs and the 
school. The only places which have many
people working for them are the        
Nurseries in Longworth and Hinton.     
There are two flower and tree nurseries
in Longworth and one in Hinton.        
 A couple from the village have a      
workshop at the bottom of their garden 
and make things from wood. Mostly they 
make wooden toys, games and            
instruments.                           
 Some people have part time jobs       
helping old people in the village and  
some cant find any work at all.
