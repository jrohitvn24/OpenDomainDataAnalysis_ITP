		<title>04Family Life in Chorleywood</title>
		<content>   On Monday morning Mum is always the 
first one to get up. Then follows Dad  
and then my sister and I. We do not    
have breakfast together because Dad has
to leave for work early and so he must 
have an early breakfast. Soon          
afterwards my friend comes to call for 
me and my sister's friend calls for her
and then we both walk to school. On    
weekdays we hardly ever eat together   
because Dad always arrives home late   
from work. At the weekends though we   
do. On Saturday we normally will go for
a walk or a publunch. We wear jeans and
teeshirts or skirts and teeshirts which
of course Dad does not wear. We go to a
hotel which has been built in          
Chorleywood, called "The Sportsman" and
has a restaurant and a snack food place
which is open to the public that are   
not living at the hotel and have come  
to eat.                                </content>
