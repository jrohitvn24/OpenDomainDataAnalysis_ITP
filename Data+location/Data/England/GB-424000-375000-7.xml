		<title>07BMX IN THE 80'S</title>
		<content>   Most children in the 1980's have got
 BMX bicycles or would like one.The    
 most popular make between{racing}and  
 freestyle in this village is          
 freestyle.Freestyle is when you do    
 tricks and try not to put your        
 feet on the ground.                   
   On the{13th of June}down at the car 
 park by the playing fields the youth  
 club held a{BMX}display.They started  
 off by doing any trick that they      
 wanted to do then they started to jump
 off a ramp and over a{fire}but when   
 Tim Weston went over the fire it was  
 at its highest point so he did a front
 wheel crash because of the smoke.     
   Marcus Riley who was taking care    
 of the fire{extinguisher}thought      
 that it was on fire off and let       
 off the extinguisher by mistake.He had
 to pay for a new one.
