		<title>04THOUGHTS ON WOLLASTON</title>
		<content>    I like{Wollaston}because it is     
 nicely placed between town and        
 country. It is a pleasant village in  
 which to live. Most of the time it is 
 peaceful and quiet, yet it has enough 
 life not to be boring. It does have   
 some faults, it does not have its own 
 library, school clinic or swimming    
 baths, we have to go to the nearest   
 town of{Stourbridge}for these         
 facilities. We only have one small    
 bank branch, and a very inconveniently
 placed post office in the village. In 
 fact, away from the centre of{        
{Wollaston,}shops and facilities are   
 few.{Wollaston}has plenty of community
 spirit however, it has provided clubs,
 community centres and activities      
 through its own resources. I like     
 living in{Wollaston.
