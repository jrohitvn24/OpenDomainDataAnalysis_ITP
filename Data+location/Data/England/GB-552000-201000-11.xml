  The Castle Players were established  
 17 years ago.It began as a musical    
 company, a small group met to perform 
 the words and music of one of the     
 founder members Ben Hough. They went  
 on to perform straight plays.They try 
 to perform two full length productions
 a year and have become renowned for   
 their excellence. The Castle Players  
 performed in a pageant for the town's 
 twinning with Cerizay. Each year the  
 members take part in a pantomime and  
 they also do performances at Jubilee  
 Lodge for the disabled.               
  It has a membership of about 40 and  
 ages range from 21 onwards. For many  
 years the Castle Players performed at 
 Ongar Comprehensive, but recently they
 moved to the Budworth Hall because of 
 better facilities. The present        
 chairman is Ben Hough.                </content>
