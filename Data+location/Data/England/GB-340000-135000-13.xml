		<title>13Ashcott - The community</title>
		<content> In the village there is a good        
{community}spirit.The people adjust    
 well to the newcomers and changes.The 
 main village{shop}is in constant use, 
 and sells everything that people need.
 A lot of people would find it very    
 awkward shopping in the towns all the 
 time.The only trouble caused is by    
 having people coming in from nearby   
 towns.The many inns and pubs provide  
 plenty of entertainment.The hall      
 houses playgroups,meetings and similar
 functions including many organisations
 ,clubs and sales or parties.Very few  
 people attend services in the very    
 beautiful,well kept{church.}Familiar  
 church-goers are not deterred,but     
 younger people are not interested.Also
 ,now nobody forces their families to  
 attend.There is a playing{field}in    
 Ashcott,but not as the people would   
 like.                                 </content>
