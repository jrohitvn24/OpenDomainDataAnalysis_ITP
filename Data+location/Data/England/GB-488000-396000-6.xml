		<title>06Scotton/Northorpe Employment</title>
		<content> Few people in this farming area are   
 employed in agriculture (see Farming) 
 the majority of men work in towns,    
 many in Scunthorpe where British Steel
 is the largest employer in the area. 8
 or so men work in education; others   
 work in industry, banking, insurance, 
 accountancy, journalism and the law   
 (police and solicitors); market trad- 
 ers, lorry drivers, railway workers,  
 electricans, builders and council     
 workers. Some are self-employed (see  
 Trade) and some are unemployed.  In   
 recent years several men have taken   
 jobs abroad, their wives coping alone 
 with home and family in their absence.
 An increasing number of women work,   
 mainly in teaching shops and secre-   
 tarial work. Glebe House employs 15   
 women: the proposed restaurant at Nor-
 thorpe should provide more jobs. There
 is seasonal, casual work on the farms.</content>
