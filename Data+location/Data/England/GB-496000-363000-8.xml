		<title>08WADDINGTON WIVES GROUP</title>
		<content>   The Waddington and Brant Road Wives 
 Group has been running 17 years.      
   It has 60 members and meets in the  
 church once a month, on every third   
 Tuesday.                              
   People go to meet other mums and    
 talk about their problems. Women can  
 join when they are married.           
   They go on visits to places of      
 interest like the zoo and air shows.  
   They sometimes take the children to 
 the theatre. This year they are going 
 on a boat trip.                       
   People come and entertain them      
 and teach them things that help them  
 in the home.                          
   They raise money by having jumble   
 sales.                                
   It is the only club in Waddington   
 that takes the people from upper and  
 lower Waddington.
