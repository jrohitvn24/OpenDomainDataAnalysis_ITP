		<content> About one third of our D-block lies   
 within the boundary of the Blackmoor  
 Estate. The estate is owned by the    
 third Lord Selborne. It was founded   
 about 120 years ago by Sir Roundell   
 Palmer, the first Lord Selborne. He   
 bought up the small local farms as    
 they became available, and made an    
 estate of about 2500 acres, or 1000   
 hectares.                             
 Land and Drainage Costs.              
 1868 the land was valued at Â£20 per   
      acre and the cost of drainage was
      Â£14 per acre.                    
 1968 the land was valued at Â£100 per  
      acre and the cost of drainage was
      Â£200 to Â£300 per acre.           
 1985 the land is valued at Â£2000 per  
      acre and the cost of drainage is 
      Â£400 per acre.
