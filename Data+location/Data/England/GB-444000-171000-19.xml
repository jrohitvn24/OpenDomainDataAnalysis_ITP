		<title>19A GAMEKEEPER</title>
		<content> Gamekeeping is a profession and       
 not as some people believe,a hobby.It 
 can involve looking after and breeding
 pheasants,organising private shoots   
 (which occur around six times a year),
 the maintenance of the woodlands he   
 patrols which still includes some     
 coppicing and controlling pests.The   
 gamekeeper does not use his gun as    
 much for this purpose as people think.
 He mainly uses traps which are        
 protected so that pheasants,which the 
 landowners breed,can't get injured.The
 main pests which he has to control are
 foxes,rabbits,pigeons,magpies and     
 squirrels.Often the gamekeeper has    
 permission to shoot any domestic pets 
 which may be endangering the          
 pheasants.These are kept in enclosures
 to stop animals hunting them.When they
 are young their wings are clipped to  
 stop them flying before they should.  </content>
