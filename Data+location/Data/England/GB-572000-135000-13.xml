		<title>13Hop Growing &amp; Marketing.</title>
		<content>Hops are grown in Kent for use in beer 
making. The acreage has shrunk in      
recent years due to more efficient use 
and the production of more lagers,     
which require less hops. Some          
continental lagers made under licence  
stipulate the use of imported hops.    
1985 has seen an increase in 'hop      
wilt'   and this area is replacing the 
older aromatic varieties with the more 
bitter wilt resistant ones, which are  
in direct competition with continental 
hops. The aromatic oil of the hop has  
a soporific effect which is supposed to
be of assistance to insomniacs. Hops   
are dried in kilns known as oast-houses
and their circular buildings topped    
with a white cowl are a feature of     
Kentish countryside. Many are now being
converted into houses but retain their 
outward appearance.
