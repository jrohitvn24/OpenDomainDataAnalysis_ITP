		<content> General research is carried out by    
 many companies into scales,           
 preferences, greater                  
 efficiency and an evaluation of       
 products. Individual companies are    
 involved in geological research,      
 pressure control and techniques for   
 pest control. Most companies appeared 
 to have continuing polices of         
 investing in new machinery despite the
 considerable expense involved.        
 Using the parents of the children of  
 Halsford Park Primary and Blackwell   
 Junior Schools as a sample survey we  
 found that 26% of fathers and 87% of  
 mothers worked in East Grinstead. A   
 further 5% of both parents worked     
 within 10km, another 10% within 20km  
 and a further 28% travelled up to 50km
 a day. Of the fathers, 5 work away    
 from home, in the North Sea (2),Italy,
 New York and Hong Kong.               </content>
