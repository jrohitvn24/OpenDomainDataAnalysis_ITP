 Here are some games that we play in   
 our playground at school.             
{"Rebound".                            
 You need a ball and a wall.6 or less  
 people can play.One person kicks the  
 ball against the wall. When it bounces
 number two kicks it against the wall. 
 Number three kicks it then four then  
 five.Then six then one again.If       
 someone misses the wall they are out  
 of the game.If someone kicks the ball 
 when it is not their turn they are    
 out.The game ends when one person is  
 left. He is the winner.               
{"Cat and mouse".                      
 You need about 20 people. 1 person is 
 cat and 1 person is mouse.The rest of 
 the people stand in a circle with 1   
 arm pointing out of the circle.The cat
 chases the mouse round the outside and
 if he catches it they change over.    </content>
