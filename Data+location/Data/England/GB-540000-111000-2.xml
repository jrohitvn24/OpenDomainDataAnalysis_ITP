		<title>02CHANGING USES OF BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> This block is full of buildings which 
 are now used for something different  
 from their original purpose.          
{Mill House, Mill Lane, Hamsey}was a   
 working water mill until 1879. It     
 became unprofitable becuse larger     
 steam mills were taking over. It was  
{converted into a house}and has been in
 the family of the present owners, the 
 Clarkes, for centuries.               
{The Post Office, Offham}is now a{tea  
{room,}selling home-made scones. Since 
 people here now have cars they can    
 drive into Lewes and visit the post   
 office whilst doing their weekly      
 shopping.The post box is still used.  
{Malling House}was built in 1720 as a  
 home for the Spence family. In 1947 it
 was bought by the County Council and  
 is now{Sussex Police Headquarters.    
 More buildings have been added and it 
 is the largest employer in the block. </content>
