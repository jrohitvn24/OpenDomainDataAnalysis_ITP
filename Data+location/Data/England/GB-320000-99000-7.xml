 One of the local customs is           
 cidermaking. The best cider is made   
 from apples especially grown for this 
 purpose; they are sweet and juicy but 
 also slightly bitter tasting. To make 
 the cider the farmer gathers all the  
 apples and puts them in a crusher. The
 apple pulp is then placed in a cider  
 press in between layers of clean      
 straw. This is called a cheese. The   
 cheese is pressed down and the juice  
 is collected into wooden barrels and  
 allowed to ferment for about three    
 months. The bigger the barrelful the  
 better th cider becomes!              
 A locally made cheese is the Dorset   
 vinny a blue veined cheese eaten with 
 Dorset Knobs.
