		<title>12ZODIAC SIGNS - CAPRICORNIUS</title>
		<content>    It is believed that all the signs  
 of the Zodiac can be traced on the    
 landscape of the Glastonbury area. Our
 area is almost covered by the shape of
 Capricornius, the goat fish. The nose 
 of the creature starts at Norwood Park
 farm and its head is traced by the    
 footpath from the farm to the main    
 Edgarley to West Pennard road at      
 Havyatt. The horn is represented by   
 the ridge known as Ponter's Ball. From
 there the back of the creature follows
 the main road east as far as Steanbow 
 bridge. The feet and underparts of the
 body follow the river Whitelake.      
 Footpaths form the chest and chin to  
 complete the body.
