		<title>06MILE OAK FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content>The Mile Oak Football Club has been    
standing for 27 years. It is situated  
south of the Mile Oak public house. We 
discovered that the club was originally
3 times smaller than it is today.      
Success has meant larger crowds. The   
extension was built in 1983, so the    
club today is only 3 years old. The    
original building was built in 1958.   
The Football Club is well known around 
Tamworth, and earlier this year the    
club was promoted to a higher division.
The club has been going since the      
nineteenth century. North of the club  
is mainly country side, but south of it
is nearly all buildings. The club is   
surrounded by large houses owned by    
wealthy people.
