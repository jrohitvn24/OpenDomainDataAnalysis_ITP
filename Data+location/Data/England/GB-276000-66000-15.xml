		<content> The Primary School here is for        
 children aged 5 to 11 years.It was    
 built in 1854 with a donation from    
 Louisa Champernowne of Dartington     
 Hall.The old school log which is      
 housed in Exeter tells us of          
 eighty-two children present.The school
 then catered for children up to 12    
 years and there were two'monitors'and 
 the 'Master'.                         
        The Headmaster is Mr.Symons    
 ,the Infant Teacher is Mrs.J.Brown and
 there are 32 children.The older       
 children collected all the information
 for this survey.                      
        The largest number of children 
 ever on roll was 105 when many        
 evacuees were billetted locally in    
 1941 during the bombing of London.    
     Miss Bright was then head ,and    
 Mr.J.Steele succeeded her .With       
 parents help the school thrives.      </content>
