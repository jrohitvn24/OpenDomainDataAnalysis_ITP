		<title>18EAST MEON - BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Although the village was mentioned in 
 the Domesday Book of 1085,there was   
 probably a settlement here in earlier 
 times.Today the village shows evidence
 of its long history in its buildings  
 many of which like the church (where  
 Roundhead soldiers are supposed to    
 have been buried) and the Almshouses  
 are of made of local flints,often with
 the corners squared in stone.Other    
 buildings are of red brick,some are   
 half timbered.Many of the buildings   
 have been whitewashed and some are    
 thatched.The Court House dates from   
 the Middle Ages.One in the High Street
 is Georgian in appearance.There are a 
 number of Victorian farm workers'     
 cottages and even some late 20th      
 Century council housing.Many buildings
 show evidence of the continuous       
 adaptations, re-building and changes  
 that have occured over the years.     </content>
