		<title>05"Bowcombe"-Rowborough Farm.</title>
		<content>  {Rowborough}is one of two farms held 
 by the present owner, the other being{
{Idlecombe Farm;}inhabited and managed 
 by his son. The two farms together    
 comprise about 500 acres and, like the
 other farms in the area, combine in   
 roughly equal proportions arable      
 farming and cattle farming. Pigs are  
 also kept, and the owner has a small  
 herd of French Charolais cattle of    
 which he is very proud.               
   Like the family who farm Cheverton; 
 the family who farm Rowborough and    
 Idlecombe have many local relatives,  
 some of whom also farm.               
   As with other farms in the area; the
 nature of the land poses certain      
 problems: Its hilly terrain can cause 
 difficulty, and the acidity of the    
 soil calls for regular dressing with  
 chalk; of which there is fortunately  
 an abundance in the area.             </content>
