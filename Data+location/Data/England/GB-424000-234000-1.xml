		<title>01The Wolfords and Todenham</title>
		<content> This block, on the fringe of the      
 Cotswolds, covers the three small     
 rural communities of Little Wolford   
 and Great Wolford in Warwickshire and 
 part of Todenham in Gloucestershire.  
 The three villages are set in rolling 
 farmland bounded by trees and hedges  
 with patches of woodland. The three   
 small streams which drain the area    
 flow north to join the river Stour    
 just out of the block. There are good 
 communications with other areas as the
 main Oxford to Stratford road passes  
 to the east of Little Wolford.        
 However, although these villages are  
 only a mile apart they are quite      
 separate communities. The two Wolfords
 share some activities but have few    
 links with Todenham.
