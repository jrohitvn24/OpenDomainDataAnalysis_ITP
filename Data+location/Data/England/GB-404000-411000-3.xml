 In the canals are lots of old tyres   
 and pieces of bike frames.Now they are
 cleaning all the mud out of the       
 canal.Some workmen fromthe Manpower   
 Services and from the British         
 Waterways Board have come to make the 
 canal usable again.                   
 There is a lot of rubbish in the      
 canal.Before they could clean it out  
 the canal had to be drained.          
 They have been making new gates for   
 the locks.There has been a lot of mud 
 on the side of the canal.             
 We have a barge called Stan that gives
 rides to people.The men are working   
 between Warehouse Hill and West       
 Slaithwaite.It is too dangerous to go 
 in Standedge tunnel now.The roof is   
 falling in.
