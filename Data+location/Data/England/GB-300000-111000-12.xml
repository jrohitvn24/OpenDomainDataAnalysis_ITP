 she doesn't know where residents used 
 to live before these came. All in all 
 she thinks the changes have made      
 Halberton a nicer place to live in.   
                                       
{AN INTERVIEW WITH MR. SALTER          
                                       
 Salters Stores in Willand has been    
 there 70 years.We decided to interview
 the owner. The original shop has been 
 extended twice.Mr Salter added a cash 
 and carry and a store room.The        
 biggest and most important change for 
 him was the industrial site being     
 built and then all the new houses.    
 This increased business and helped him
 a lot.In his lifetime the village has 
 grown 10 times bigger.The opening of  
 the big stores in Tiverton did affect 
 business at first but now it is       
 beginning to come back.               </content>
