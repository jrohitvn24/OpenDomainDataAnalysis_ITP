		<title>15FISHING BY THE THAMES</title>
		<content>  The fishing rights on the Eton side  
 of the Thames from the Master's       
 boat-house to lower Clewer village    
 belong to Eton College.We talked to a 
 river-baillif from the college.       
 Permits cost Â£5 a year or 50p a day   
 and help to check how many people are 
 fishing .Even College boys need them  
 There are pike,tench,perch, gudgeon   
 and rudd in the river.The baillif had 
 seen a seventeen pound pike landed at 
 the little weir In 1980 they stocked  
 the pond with 50 tench,50cms long.    
  There are five baillifs responsible  
 for security and fishing.There are    
 many small streams running into the   
 river at Eton.The baillifs patrol the 
 college grounds.One night vandals     
 damaged 15 trees.Another night the    
 goalposts were broken.People often    
 leave fishing gear by the bank and the
 baillif takes it in.                  </content>
