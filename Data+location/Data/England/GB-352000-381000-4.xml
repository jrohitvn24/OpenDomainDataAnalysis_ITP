		<title>04RUNCORN'S LOCAL PLACE NAMES</title>
		<content> Runcorn is a town,which has witnessed 
 many changes over the past 20 years,  
 for a new town has slowly enveloped   
 the surrounding countryside.The only  
 clues to the past now lie in the names
 of the new estates and streets.       
 Barnfield Avenue,Palacefields and     
 Brookvale are now home to thousands of
 people where once,not so very long ago
 crops grew and cattle grazed.Windmill 
 Hill,as its name suggests was open    
 hillside and boasted a windmill.Now it
 is a large estate with 2 schools,a    
 church and a local shop.Halton Castle,
 which sits in ruins upon the hill     
 above Halton Village,used to survey   
 the fields which separated Halton from
 Runcorn.Now the gap has been filled by
 estates,which take their names from   
 the castle and village,such as Halton 
 Brook,Halton Brow and Castlefields.
