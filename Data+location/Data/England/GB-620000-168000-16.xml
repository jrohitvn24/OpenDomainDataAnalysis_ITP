		<content>     We interviewed Mrs Stevens, one of
the dinner ladies at Reculver School   
because she has lived in this area all 
her life. She remembers quite clearly  
being a pupil at the school during the 
Second World War and the constant      
noise of planes overhead.Since 1950 she
says the ares has changed quite a bit  
in some ways,the village of Reculver is
still a small village but then it had  
one small caravan site and very few    
summer visitors.The coastguards        
cottages were then inhabited and quite 
a few children from the village        
attended the school,today there are    
only two and the coastguards cottages  
are being demolished.The present sea   
wall dates from after the floods of    
1953 when a lot of the old sea wall    
collapsed.There were no amusements and 
no shops that catered for campers or   
holday makers.                         </content>
