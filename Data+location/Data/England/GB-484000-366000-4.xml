		<content>  In this area there are many farms,   
 altogether there are twenty eight.    
 They are mainly crop farms. They grow 
 potatoes, red beet, fodder beet, sugar
 beet, cereal crops and flower bulbs.  
 There are a few sheep and cattle on   
 the farms but no dairy farms.         
  The land is very light and is easy to
 work all through the year but in a dry
 spell crops need watering or they will
 not grow .There are some specal farms.
 One farm hatches pheasant and         
 partridge eggs and rears the young    
 chicks to sell. Low moor farm         
 specalises in weaner pigs.Then they   
 sell them for people to rear.         
 We now have turkeys reared in sheds at
 willow farm.
