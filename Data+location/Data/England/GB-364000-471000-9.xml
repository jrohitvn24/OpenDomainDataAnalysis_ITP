		<content> Area is in the parish  of Thornton  in
 Lonsdale  with Burton  in  Lonsdale in
 the  Diocese  of  Bradford.  Until the
 church was completed in 1870 there was
 only a Chapel-of-ease in Burton.   The
 church   is  very   evangelistic   and
 forward - looking  and  is  active  in
 village  life.   There  are  89 on the
 electoral  roll.  The  Vicar, the Rev.
 H.M.Kitchen  lives  at the Vicarage in
 Low St. He conducts morning service in
 Burton  and  afternoon  in   Thornton.
 There  are  Methodist churches in both
 villages   ( Minister  -  The   Rev.  
 Jennifer Lunn )   with   congregations
 drawn  mainly  from surrounding farms.
 Young  people take  an  active part in
 the services.  Joint Church of England
 / Methodist  services   are   held  at
 Christmas.
