		<title>12REDMARLEY YOUTH CLUB BY CLAR</title>
		<content> On Monday we have youth club. It      
 starts at 7.0 clock till 9.0 clock.   
 When we get there we have to pay 20p  
 to get in. When we have paid we get   
 out tabletennis, snooker, darts and   
 swingball. Sometimes we go out side   
 and play football and volleyball. You 
 can buy a drink, crisps and sweets for
 10p 7p 2p and 1p.Sometimes we have    
 special events like Archery. Sometimes
 we finish about a quarter of an hour  
 before nine, which is when we go, and 
 play either races, British Bulldog, or
 Ship Shaw. There are about 40 chidren 
 going and more will be starting when  
 they reach the age of 10. The children
 leave at the age of 16. We usually go 
 somewhere like the Leisure Centre once
 every two months. We go swimming.     
 Hopefully we are getting a Redmarley  
 youth club mini bus to take us to     
 Gloucester.                           </content>
