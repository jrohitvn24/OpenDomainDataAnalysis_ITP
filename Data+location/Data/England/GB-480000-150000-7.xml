 TV  or video between 8 and 10 on a    
 Saturday morning . Many families      
 shop in local towns on Saturday       
 morning to buy food and clothes.      
 some buy snack lunches whilst         
 shopping.A few families visited       
 places of interest and friends.Many   
 children played outside their houses  
 for the greater part of the day when  
 the weather permitted.                
   {Local Facilities.}                 
 Peter Driver Sports Centre, Football, 
 especially junior clubs, netball and  
 badminton.Horse riding is very common.
 There are art classes and groups at   
 Holy Trinty, Christ Church and Ewshot 
 halls.There is a very successful and  
 thriving Drama group_ The Christ
