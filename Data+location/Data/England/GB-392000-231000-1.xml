		<title>01General Review of the Area</title>
		<content> The area of 12 square kilometres      
 covered by this survey all lies within
 the county of Gloucestershire. Most of
 it is in the parish of Ashchurch, but 
 it also includes small parts of the   
 parishes of Teddington and Oxenton.It 
 is all low lying land in the Lower    
 Severn Valley except at the extreme SE
 corner; here there is Oxenton Hill, an
 outlier of the Cotswolds.It is mostly 
 farmland though there is a large      
 modern housing development at the NW  
 corner, at Northway.Here there is also
 the large factory of Dowty Mining.    
 Other factories lie just outside the  
 area near the M5 motorway.Further E   
 are the church, our school and the    
 large Army Vehicle Depot. The         
 main-line railway (to Birmingham)cuts 
 through here from N to S.The busy A438
 trunk road also passes from E to W    
 right by our school.                  </content>
