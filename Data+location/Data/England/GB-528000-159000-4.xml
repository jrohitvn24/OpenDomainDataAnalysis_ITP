		<content>   Purley is a very nice area. It is   
 like a town but also like the         
 countryside.                          
   There are lots of trees. There are  
 quite a few shops around and a big    
 shopping centre in the middle.        
   There are lots of parks and woods in
 and around Purley. The houses are very
 nice. They are quite old and the      
 gardens are big. It is not busy.      
   The people who live here are quite  
 rich. Old Lodge Lane has some shops   
 along it and there is an ambulance    
 station. There is a fire station on   
 the Brighton Road.                    
   Purley is a very nice place to live 
 in.
