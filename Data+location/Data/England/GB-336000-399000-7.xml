		<content> We are very lucky where we live       
 because there is a canal and lots of  
 fields, countryside and farms.  When  
 we went on our 5 mile sponsored       
 Domesday walk around our area we saw  
 lots of living things as we passed    
 through the streets and countryside.  
 There were buttercups on the side of  
 the road and wild iris inbetween tall 
 reeds growing by the canal.           
 Earthnuts or pignuts were growing     
 practically everywhere.   There were  
 daisies, dandelions and wild bluebells
 scattered along the grass verges and  
 dock leaves and berries in the hedges.
  I saw lots of cabbage white          
 butterflies and a caterpillar on a    
 leaf with a ladybird which was        
 preparing to fly.  There were lots of 
 brambles and nettles hanging into the 
 road and bees and wasps were hovering 
 over various wild flowers.            </content>
