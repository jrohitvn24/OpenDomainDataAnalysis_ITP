   Walking around{Urban Jarrow }you    
 would be surprised how much wildlife  
 you can find despite the houses.      
 At the Box's, which is the local name 
 for an area of rough ground once owned
 by the Box family (site of Hedworth   
 Hall grid ref 337631 burned to the    
 ground in 1972) there are animals and 
 insects to be seen.                   
    In Box's there are blackberry      
 bushes where thrushes keep their anvil
 stones. It is an ideal place as there 
 are many banded snails on the plants. 
 In one of the bushes was a Privet Hawk
 Moth. Under  the stones were woodlice,
 a slug, a jumping spider and a        
 "harvest man".  Nearby were quite a   
 few birds e.g. Sparrows,              
 crows,seagulls and housemartins.
