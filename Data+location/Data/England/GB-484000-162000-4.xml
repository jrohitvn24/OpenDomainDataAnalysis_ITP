		<content> Edgbarrow Woods is composed of 31.5   
 hectares of heathland,woodland and    
 bog. Most of the area lies within a   
{Site of Special Scientific Interest.} 
{WOODLAND}occupies the higher ground.  
 It is fairly recent in origin either  
 having been planted or having invaded 
 areas which were once heathland.      
                                       
{DRY HEATH}is found on the slopes. At  
 some time it has been deep ploughed to
 improve drainage. Burnt tree stumps   
 are the evidence of many heath fires, 
 particularly during the drought of    
 1976.                                 
                                       
{WET HEATH &amp; BOG}occupies the lowest   
 ground. Deep ploughing has failed to  
 improve drainage. The soils are deep, 
 peaty and waterlogged. They smell     
 strongly of marsh gas when disturbed.
