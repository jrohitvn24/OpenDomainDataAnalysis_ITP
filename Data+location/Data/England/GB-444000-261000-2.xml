		<title>02ARTS AND CRAFTS EXHIBITION</title>
		<content> Napton has a flourishing art group    
 which meets weekly and organises an   
 annual Easter exhibition. This        
 exhibition attracts many visitors and 
 the profits are given to the Village  
 Hall Fund and the Church. The school  
 children have their work in a separate
 room and this is just for display.    
 This year we displayed a group of     
 arctic animals made from clay; various
 pieces of woodwork including a stable;
 puppets, and sewing which included    
 felt pictures and stuffed animals. We 
 also displayed models made from junk. 
 Some children had decorated eggs and  
 there were many paintings and         
 drawings.
