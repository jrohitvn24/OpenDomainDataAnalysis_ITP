		<title>11Restoration of Barrow School</title>
		<content> The{Barrow School}was opened in{1716  
 and closed in{1943}when the boys were 
 transferred to the present school.    
 Behind the school are the{12          
{alms-houses}which were built by the   
{1st Earl of Strafford}in{1696.}The    
{Wentworth Estate}are now completely   
{renovating}these{alms-houses}into old 
 peoples homes.A man took us inside one
 of the{alms-houses}which was one of   
 the first to be started on.On this    
 house the slates have been taken off  
 and been put back on neater to keep   
 the rain out.Then the man took us in  
 to one of the houses which had not    
 been started on it had beams holding  
 it up it smelt damp inside.The        
{alms-houses}and  the{Barrow School}is 
 joined together to make a square      
 inside the square there is a big grass
 patch. There is an old {well}right in 
 the middle of the square.             </content>
