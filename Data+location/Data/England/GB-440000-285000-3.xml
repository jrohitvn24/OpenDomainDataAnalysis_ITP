		<title>03New Wolvey -Employment</title>
		<content> We asked a selection of villagers     
 about the 'New' Wolvey people.        
 "They've come from Coventry and       
 Nuneaton to live here but they don't  
 work here. Their{EMPLOYMENT}is in the 
 towns outside Wolvey because there's  
 mainly farming around here.In fact    
 there's a good many in the past who   
 went from{FARMING}to work in the car  
 factories in Coventry and at{ROLLS    
{ROYCE}in Ansty."                      
 "There are 3 garages in the village   
 only 1 of which sells petrol.There is 
 a Post Office, an Off Licence and a   
 General Stores which used to be the   
 Co-op about 20 years ago.Apart from   
 the school and the 2 Public Houses    
 there is not much more employment in  
 the village."                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
