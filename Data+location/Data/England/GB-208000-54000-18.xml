		<title>18TYWARDREATH- 19TH CENTURY</title>
		<content> In {Tywardreath in the 1840's}life was
 very poor. The main industry was      
{mining tin and copper.} There are     
 still old engine houses around. The   
 population of the village was 3000 to 
 4000 people. A large number worked at 
{Fowey Consols}copper mine.            
 The women and girls broke up the ore  
 when it came from the mine. They were 
 paid 40p a week. The mines were all   
 lit by candles and until 1851 the     
 miners had to climb long ladders at   
 the beginning and end of every day.   
 Girls as young as 7 or 8 worked for 3d
 a day. No women, girls or boys under  
 10 worked underground.                
 The men were paid half in money and   
 half in tokens. The tokens had to be  
 spent in the mine owners' shops and   
 pubs. Most houses belonged to the mine
 owners. Two cottages in North Street  
 were built from mine waste.           </content>
