		<title>16Recreation around Widmerpool</title>
		<content> Widmerpool is in the area covered by  
 the{Quorn Hunt,}which during the sea- 
 son appears on about 3 Mondays and an 
 occasional Saturday. Members of the   
 Royal Family hunt with the Quorn and  
 enjoy the hospitality of one Widmer-  
 pool farmer. With a stud farm in Wid- 
 merpool and riding stables in nearby  
 Keyworth,{horse riding}is a popular   
 pastime. One Widmerpool lady takes an 
 active interest in the{Riding for the 
{Disabled}movement. There is a tradi-  
 tion of{rough shooting}going back to  
 the days of the Hall with its game-   
 keepers and organised shoots. One     
 farmer still allows shooting on his   
 land, mostly pheasant and partridge   
 and occasional duck. Widmerpool play- 
 ing field was sold to{Keyworth Rugby  
{Club}so is used for this sport during 
 the winter months. There is{fishing}  
 for trout in the stream.              </content>
