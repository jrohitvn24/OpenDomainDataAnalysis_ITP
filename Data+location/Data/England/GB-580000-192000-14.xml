		<content> Netball is a very popular game and is 
 played in many schools around the     
 country.Netball is played on a court  
 100 ft long and 50 ft wide.The court  
 is divided into two goal thirds and a 
 centre third.At either end stands a   
 goal post and in the middle third is  
 a circle where the game starts off.In 
 front of the goal post is a semi      
 circle this is called the shooting    
 circle.On each side they have seven   
 players.Playing are:two goal shooters,
 two goal keepers,one wing attack,one  
 wing defence,one goal attack,one goal 
 defence and one centre.The game starts
 off by one off by one of the team     
 standing in the second third.She      
 throws the ball to one of her team    
 mates.The idea of the game is to score
 as many goals as possible.
