		<title>05Football-Stambourne Lions</title>
		<content> A few years ago a group of boys wanted
 to start a football club so they asked
 parents Ken and Jean Gooderham if they
 could start a club. Jean and Ken      
 wanted the boys to have a club so they
 asked the Parish Council if they could
 use Stamboune playing field as a      
 pitch.  Luckily the council agreed.   
 The Club also wrote to Earls Colne &amp;  
 Halstead  Educational Charity.A       
 fortnight later a letter came back    
 with a Â£200 cheque enclosed.So Jean   
 and the boys went to a sports shop and
 brought the best kits there.After that
 they had a jumble sale which raised   
 some money for the goal posts.First of
 all they called themselves Steeple    
 Strikers but after a while they called
 themselves Stambourne Lions because a 
 lot of Stambourne players joined. Now 
 there are two teams playing in local  
 leagues.                              </content>
