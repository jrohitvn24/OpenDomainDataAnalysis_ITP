		<title>20My village, Slyne-with-Hest</title>
		<content>I have lived in Slyne-with-Hest for    
about eight and a half years. It is a  
nice little village and is very quiet. 
Slyne-with-Hest is generally a safe    
place to live and away from the two    
main roads it is quiet.Slyne-with-Hest 
is close to the sea and surrounded by  
beautiful country side.I like it at    
Slyne-with-Hest as it is not as noisy  
as in London.You can get to busy       
places because Slyne-with-Hest is      
close to the M6 motorway.The thing I   
dislike about Slyne-with-Hest is that  
it is nearly always cold and           
wet.Despite this,I enjoy living in     
Slyne-with-Hest, because the people    
are kind and friendly, and it is a     
beautiful area.
