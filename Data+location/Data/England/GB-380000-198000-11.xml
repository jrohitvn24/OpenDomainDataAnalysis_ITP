		<title>11Court Farm,Nympsfield.</title>
		<content>   The farm consists of{240 acres.}100 
 acres of this is arable land,120 acres
 for grazing and 20 acres of woodland. 
   This farm has 2 barns, 1 old one and
 1 new one.The old barn is made from   
 Cotswold stone.The beams in the old   
 barn are probably from a ship because 
 the markings show this.The original   
 tiles were taken off the barn around  
 1923 and sent to America with others  
 from a farm in Tetbury.               
   In the old barn there are pigeon    
 holes.These holes were blocked up     
 because the structure of the barn was 
 weak.The larger hole was for the owl  
 who kept the mice away.               
   The farm owns a granary.The sacks   
 used to be put onto a rope and then   
 hoisted to the top.Now the grain is   
 screwed up in a large tube and left   
 to dry.There is a  mill below the     
 grain store.                          </content>
