		<content>   Sweeping down towards the main road 
 Pagan's Hill marks a place where      
 Romans trod but now sledges ride.     
 Everyone knows Pagan's Hill - it's a  
 sort of landmark of the village of    
 Chew Stoke. It makes me feel proud    
 that our name is mentioned because of 
 Pagan's Hill "the site where Romans   
 once civilized". It's funny to think  
 that where thousands of years ago     
 Romans were civilizing and walking on 
 the same ground as you are walking on.
 It is their hill its the Pagan's Hill.
   When lakes are frozen, and gardens  
 bleak Pagan's Hill is alive with      
 people, sledges for two, or even trays
 that send you spinning, high jumps,   
 human fliers, plastic bombers and     
 snowball fights. Pagan's Hill will    
 always be an important memory for me.
