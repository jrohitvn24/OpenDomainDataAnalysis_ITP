		<title>08Trade in Woburn</title>
		<content> There is quite a variety of shops in  
 Woburn consisting of a butcher and    
 greengrocer, a post office, some art  
 galleries, a reject china shop, a few 
 boutiques, a shoe shop, a book shop   
 and a number of antique shops.        
                                       
 Woburn really caters for tourists and 
 not its own residents because as you  
 will see there are many expensive     
 boutiques and craft shops. Most of    
 these shops are open on Sunday for the
 visitors who come to see the Abbey.   
 There are only two small food shops to
 provide for the villagers who have to 
 go elsewhere for most of their needs. 
                                       
 The shops in Woburn are very nice and 
 the selection is very good but most of
 the things are very expensive.
