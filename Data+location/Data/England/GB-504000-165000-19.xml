		<title>19Gravel Extraction</title>
		<content> The major economic activity of        
 extracting gravel has been present in 
 this area since the Second World War. 
 There are a number of companies at    
 work in the area, including           
 R.M.C., Greenhams and Halls           
 Aggregates. Present consumption trends
 are escalating so future use of the   
 river terrace gravels will increase.  
 The rights to extract gravel from     
 Abbey Meads have recently revived     
 local opposition and concern from the 
 Thames Water Authority, who control   
 local water supplies.                 
 The landscape changes dramatically    
 once extraction starts, leaving many  
 water-filled pits on exhaustion of the
 gravel. These are used as leisure     
 centres for water sports, sailing and 
 fishing, and are water-bird           
 sanctuaries.
