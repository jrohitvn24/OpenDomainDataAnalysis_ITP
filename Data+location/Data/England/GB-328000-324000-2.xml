   This area is within a region of{low 
{lying}land,less than 100m above sea_  
 level in most parts.Its highest point 
 at the west side of the area is 152m  
 above sea_level:Sweeney Mountain.From 
 the summit of this the aspect below,  
 over this area,and to the north and   
 east,is one of very{gentle hills,     
 scattered farms and settlements at    
 regular intervals.This is a relatively
 unwooded landscape_most woodland in   
 view is outside our area(apart from   
 private parkland to the north).There  
 is a continual pattern of agriculture 
 throughout that part of the Shropshire
 Plain visible.Hills dominate the land_
 scape to the west and south outside   
 our area.The settlements in the area  
 under survey are generally ribbon-    
 shaped in form,following the route of 
 the roads.                            </content>
