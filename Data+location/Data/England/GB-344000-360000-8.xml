		<content> Except near Saighton where sometimes  
 there are walls of local sandstone,the
 fields usually have a hedge &amp; a ditch.
 All the hedges are trimmed by machine 
 in autumn.Hedges are of hawthorn with 
 some holly &amp; elder &amp; at intervals     
 mature trees,mainly oak,which are     
 sometimes evenly spaced,indicating    
 deliberate planting many years ago    
 eg.in Millfield Lane &amp; along Platts   
 Lane.Nearly every field also has its  
 own mature tree(s) providing shade for
 animals.A much larger deciduous wood  
 follows the Waverton Approach &amp; some  
 smaller areas act as windbreaks around
 houses eg.Hattonheath farm &amp; Hatton   
 Lodge,but there are only a few other  
 small areas eg. Saighton Gorse.Because
 of the boundary changes to make arable
 fields,the Grosvenor Estate is seeking
 permission to change the routes of    
 some little-used paths crossing them. </content>
