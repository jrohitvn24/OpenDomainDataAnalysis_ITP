		<title>02FARMING IN CHELFORD</title>
		<content> This area is mainly agricultural and  
 contains twenty-one farms. We were    
 able to visit twelve of them. All     
 except two of them were proper working
 farms. The oldest farm, Holly Tree    
 Farm dated back to the sixteenth      
 century, and Roadside,Fir-tree, Wyches
 and Peck Mill were over three hundred 
 years old.The others were all at least
 three generations old. They varied in 
 size quite a lot. The largest farm,   
 Roadside Farm had 210 acres and the   
 smallest, Wyches Farm had all the land
 sold except six acres and is now a    
 private house. All except two families
 had lived at their farms for at least 
 thirty years.                         
    Chandler's Farm has two cows for   
 their own use, thirty beef cattle, 140
 ewes, 220 lambs and 150 poultry. They 
 grow hay for their animals.
