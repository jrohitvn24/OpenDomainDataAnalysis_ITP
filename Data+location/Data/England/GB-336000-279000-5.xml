 one in the nearby area. It is an      
 Anglican church. The chapels have all 
 closed down but the{Church of England 
 is still popular. It is used by the   
 school for{harvest festivals}and end  
 of term services when the children    
 lead the sevice and play the music.   
 Clunbury no longer has its own priest 
 but shares one with three other       
 parishes.                             
   There is a rota in the church for   
 people to clean and put flowers in,   
 and there is a{Parochial Church       
{Council.}Clunbury Church has some     
{Norman}parts and the rest added later,
 with all the windows different shapes.

 hundred years.
