		<content>Sometimes canals had to negotiate hills
and so tunnels had to be constructed.A 
few of these were wide enough to allow 
a tow  path at the side of the         
tunnel,some had no path at all.The     
longest tunnel in use today is at      
Dudley near Birmingham 3172 yards      
long.Other tunnels in use :            
BLISWORTH=3056 YARDS PRESTON           
BROOK=1239 YARDS KING'S NORTON=2726    
YARDS SHORTWOOD=613 YARDS              
TARDEBRIGGE=580 YARDS                  
CHIRK=459 YARDS                        
 If a tunnel did not have a towpath    
 then the men would have to 'shaft' or 
 'leg' the boat through the tunnel.This
 involved lying on your back with your 
 feet on the walls or roof and pushing 
 the boat through with your legs.
