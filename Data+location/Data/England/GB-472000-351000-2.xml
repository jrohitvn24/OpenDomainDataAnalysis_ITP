		<content> The population is fairly mixed with   
 respect to age throughout the area and
 it is generally{middle class}but each 
 village has its distict differences.  
 Rolleston has a more indigenous       
 population than the others and a      
 higher proportion of people is        
 employed in farming.                  
 Morton has a mixture of people, from  
 long established village families and 
{newcomers}who originate from various  
 parts of the country. As a rule, but  
 not exclusively, the incomers live in 
 the newest properties.                
 Fiskerton has the highest percentage  
 of non-indigenous inhabitants who are 
 by far the most mobile. It is also a  
 slightly younger community and many of
 the incomers have an urban background.
 There are no ethnic differences.
