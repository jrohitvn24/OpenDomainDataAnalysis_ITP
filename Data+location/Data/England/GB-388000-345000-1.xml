		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>Viewing our area from its north western
extremity-Hanley City Centre-the       
panorama eastwards and southwards      
presents an immediate, and we feel,    
unique mix; that is modern shops,      
high-rise flats, Victorian Terraces,   
through areas of green space to rough  
grazing lands which surround post war  
housing estates. Industrial premises   
of various ages and types are          
interspersed throughout the area and   
Hanley itself has become the recognised
commercial and cultural centre for the 
city of Stoke-on-Trent. The following  
pages try to give information about and
impressions of this disparate area     
which covers Hanley,Northwood,parts    
of Shelton and Fenton,the outlying     
surburb of Bucknall,Townsend, and      
adjacent housing estates of Bentilee   
Berry Hill and Eaton Park.Most of the  
writing has been done by schoolchildren</content>
