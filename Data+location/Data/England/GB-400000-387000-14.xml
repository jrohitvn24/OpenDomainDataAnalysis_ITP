		<title>14NOTABLE EVENTS IN HAYFIELD</title>
		<content> The biggest change to Hayfield has    
 been the {by-pass.}It has taken heavy 
 vehicles from the village centre,     
 because the roads were too narrow     
 for the heavy vehicles.There has been 
 one very bad accident which involved  
 the chemists shop before they built   
 the by-pass. Another notable event was
 the establishing of the {camp-site    
 which enables people from the towns to
 come for the weekend and walk over    
 Kinder.Another event that has changed 
 Hayfield is the{Jazz Festival }which  
 has been in June for the past three   
 years. Another  change which has taken
 place is the amount of{houses}built,  
 the largest being 36 Jones homes down 
 Swallow House Lane.Other changes are  
 that{Hayfield Cricket Club}has now    
 got a stone pavillion, where it use to
 have a wooden one,and our {Bus service
 to Buxton has been discontinued.      </content>
