		<title>14The Gravel Pits CSP</title>
		<content>                                       
The gravel pits are situated to the    
east of the area they stretch between  
the river Colne and Grand Union Canal. 
Some pits are still worked but the ones
on our area ceased production about 10 
years ago.Remains of the old buildings 
can be seen and the site is used as a  
storage depot for sand and lime by a   
builder who owns most of the land.This 
does not disturb the wildlife which has
colonized the waterfilled pits.These   
include moorhens,coots,herons &amp; swans. 
There are also many varieties of wild- 
flowers;daisies,thistle,legumes as well
as gorse,bramble,willow,hawthorn and   
elder.One of the lakes is owned by a   
fishing club and the other by a sailing
club.
