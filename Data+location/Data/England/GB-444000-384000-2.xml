		<content> In Aughton there have been many       
 changes over the years. Population has
 increased and people have come to our 
 area from outside. This means that    
 people do not always know their       
 neighbours. There are more young      
 people and many are not as thoughtful 
 as they were. Employment has changed a
 lot with greater variety of jobs, but 
 because of increased population, still
 high unemployment. Wages are higher   
 but so is inflation so it is hard to  
 manage. Our shopping area is much     
 better but it is hard to reach the    
 shops because of traffic. It is much  
 busier. Health centres and dentists   
 are limited. There are not enough     
 playgrounds and youth clubs and that  
 means young people are on the streets 
 causing trouble. There should be quiet
 parks for old people to sit in.
