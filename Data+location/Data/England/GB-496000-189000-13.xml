		<content>We visited THE BUCKINGHAMSHIRE         
ADVERTISER and asked the {editor} "What
hit the headlines the most?" He said," 
Accidents, car-crashes or unusual      
happenings like someone falling off a  
roof and dying." His most interesting  
piece of news was when a gipsy baby was
killed in an accident and dumped in a  
field. {Disasters} and {accidents} make
the most interesting news items. I     
asked him how many {newspapers} he     
printed in a week and he replied,      
"9000". About 75% of the population of 
Chalfont St. Peter receive the local   
paper which is published weekly on     
Wednesdays.
