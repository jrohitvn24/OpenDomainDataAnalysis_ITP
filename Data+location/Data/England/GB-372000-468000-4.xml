		<content> There is a sawmill at the top of      
 Clapham.This morning our class went to
 visit it.The building is about 10 m.by
 26.5 m.and is mainly limestone.It is a
 hundred and one years old.            
   A water powered turbine makes       
 the machinery work,and the electricity
 makes it work as well.Mr Whitfield    
 uses a push bench and a travelling    
 bench.They chop up trees which have   
 fallen.The wood is used for gates and 
 repairing fences,and fire wood.They   
 sell the wood to the people in the    
 village,and some people in Austwick.  
 They cut thousands and thousands of   
 logs a year.When they cut trees       
 down they replant with new ones.The   
 woods to the north of the sawmill     
 provide most of the timber.These woods
 belong to Dr.J.Farrer,the Lord of the 
 Manor.
