		<content>We did a survey on the religions of the
3rd &amp; 4th years in our school and came 
up with some very interesting results. 
There are 26 children in the 3rd year  
class, of these 13 are Christians, 8   
are Muslims, 4 are Buddhists and 1 is  
a Sikh. 9 out of the 13 christians go  
to church. All of the 8 muslims attend 
mosques scattered around London like   
Baker Street and Regents park. The     
Buddhists all worship at home and the  
sikh goes to a temple in Stratford.    
There are 43 children in the two 4th   
year classes. Of these 26 are          
Christians, 14 are Muslims and 3 are   
Atheists (they do not believe in God)  
14 out of the 26 christians go to      
church and 11 out of the 14 muslims go 
to Mosques some distance from their    
homes.  The Atheists do not go to a    
church or a Mosque.
