		<title>05EDUCATION AT ROLPH SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{ Rolph School}is a Church of England  
 Primary School catering for children  
 between the ages of 5 and 11. It has  
 strong connections with the Parish    
 Church. It was founded by James Rolph,
 a local farmer, whose birthday is     
 remembered on June 9th each year. The 
 school is very active and its         
 curriculum includes lacemaking,       
 machine embroidery, cooking and       
 country dancing in addition to the    
 usual activities. The school is well  
 equipped with a BBC computer, disc    
 drive and monitor, a colour television
 and a video recorder. It also has 12  
 violins. At present there are 150     
 pupils in 5 classes but numbers are   
 rising and in September this year the 
 headmistress, Mrs. Sylvia Alcock, will
 no longer be a teaching head. The     
 school has a large playground and a   
 playing field with a football pitch.  </content>
