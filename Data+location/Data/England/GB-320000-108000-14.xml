		<content>   The traditional country sports are  
 still pursued whole-heartedly by some 
 of the farming community.One busy     
 farmer is also the local M.F.H."We    
 don't have no time for reading in our 
 family.A library? Now,that's something
 I've never been in! We've stopped     
 having the newspaper,too.Usually get  
 the news on television.No,I'm busy    
 enough with the hunting and the farm. 
 Being isolated out here doesn't worry 
 any of us.Even to live in the village 
 would fill us with horror.Riding and  
 fishing,that's what my daughters      
 like".                                
   Clay pigeon shoots are popular.One  
 is always a great money-spinner at the
 village fete.Skittles are played down 
 at the pub,along with darts and       
 snooker,and a tug-of-war team can     
 always be raised.
