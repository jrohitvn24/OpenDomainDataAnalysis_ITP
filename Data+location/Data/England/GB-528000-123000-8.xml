		<title>08LIFE IN CUCKFIELD-CHILDREN</title>
		<content>  After visiting Cuckfield Primary     
 School we acquired the following      
 information: The ages range from{7 to 
{11}years. The children rise at about  
 7am on a school day and 8am at the    
 weekend. Cereal, toast, orange juice, 
 tea is the main breakfast. School     
 begins at 9am and they either walk or 
 go by car. The children have to wear  
 uniform and most like it. There are   
 mixed feelings about school. The      
 favourite lesson is Art and the worst 
 Maths. For break they have 15mins in  
 which they play chase and for lunch, 1
 hour. School finishes at 3.30pm after 
 which they watch T.V, play with       
 friends and go to clubs- Brownies/    
 Guides, Cubs/Scouts, Sports and youth 
 clubs. The main time for tea is 6pm.  
 Bedtime is 8.30 to 9.30pm during the  
 week and an hour later at the weekend.
 On Sunday many go to Sunday school.   </content>
