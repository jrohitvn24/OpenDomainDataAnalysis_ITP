		<title>07JOHN ELLMAN OF GLYNDE</title>
		<content> We saw the tomb of{John Ellman}in the 
 churchyard. During the great farming  
 improvements beginning 200 years      
 ago, he made Glynde famous. He        
 concentrated on selective breeding of 
{Southdown sheep,}and his model farm,  
 Home farm, opposite the church, was   
 visited by the{Duke of Sussex,}son of 
 George III, by the{Duke of Bedford}and
 many farming landowners.              
  In 1800 Southdown sheep were little  
 known, but forty years afterwards they
 were bred throughout Britain. It is   
 not surprising if Ellman is sometimes 
 called the 'inventor' of Southdown    
 sheep. He has left no records of how  
 he bred his blocky compact animals    
 from the local fine-boned leggy sheep,
 with light fore-quarters and speckled 
 faces. Southdown sheep are  now  more 
 widely bred abroad than in this       
 country.                              </content>
