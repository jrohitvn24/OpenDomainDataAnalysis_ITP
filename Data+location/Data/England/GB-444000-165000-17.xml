		<content> In my spare time I read, walk, play   
 tennis, do puzzle books and sometimes 
 tidy my bedroom. The books I read are 
 sort of adventures and mysteries. The 
 book I'm reading now is called "Nancy 
 Drew" and the authoress is Carolyn    
 Keene. The places I go for my walks   
 are across the fields and up to       
 Donnington Castle. I do puzzle books  
 as well because they keep me occupied 
 for about half an hour. When I have   
 any spare time I do sporty things like
 athletics, tennis lessons, bike riding
 and swimming. The athletics I do are  
 sprinting, high jump and long jump. On
 Saturdays at about 5.15 pm I go to    
 St.Barts swimming pool and have       
 lessons for about three quarters of an
 hour. The strokes I swim are breast   
 stroke, front crawl, back stroke      
 and butterfly. My best stroke and my  
 fastest is front crawl.               </content>
