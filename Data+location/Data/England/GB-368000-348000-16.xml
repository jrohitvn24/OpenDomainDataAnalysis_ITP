		<content>  Wybunbury is situated on the Cheshire
 Plain.The surrounding countryside is  
 relatively flat and level, with one or
 two slight undulations.               
                                       
  The river Waldron, which is also     
 known locally as the Checkley Brook,  
 runs through a valley to the North of 
 the village. The Waldron is a         
 tributary of the river Weaver. for its
 length the Waldron flows through sandy
 type soil.                            
                                       
  Generally the surrounding countryside
 is open, with wooded areas and farms  
 scattered around the village.A number 
 of farms are under the ownership of   
 the Co-operative Society.             
                                       
  The prescence of sand has led to some
 quarrying activity and the mounds of  
 the workings can be seen.             </content>
