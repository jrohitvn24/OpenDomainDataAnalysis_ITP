		<title>19VILLAGE CHANGES SINCE 1900.</title>
		<content> cannot afford the very high cost of   
 homes.Asthese are the people to really
 appreciate and understand true village
 life,there has been a most noticeable 
 decline in the general interests of   
 this village and its past activities  
 and customs.Sadly,Abberley parish     
 &lt;with its small population of about   
 550> is rapidly changing in all       
 ways.So many home interests are now   
 found well away from the village.     
 Fortunately the beauty of the country-
 side all around the village is the    
 same as the past,may it remain so well
 into the future.
