		<title>03Appleby New Fair</title>
		<content>    The gypsies come to our town once a
 year in June.This year the gypsies    
 celebrated the three hundredth Fair.  
 Fair hill is the place where they     
 camp.                                 
    Their caravans are usually long and
 are decorated with silver plates,     
 chrome,and mirrors.The horses graze   
 on the road verges around Fair Hill.  
 They wash the horses in the river,    
 riding them into the deep water.      
    Many people in Appleby dont like   
 the new fair. During the fair the     
 streets get more crowded and its hard 
 for traffic to get through.The streets
 also get very dirty and smell horrible
 thats mostly from the horses.The fair 
 attracts many tourists as well as     
 gypsies. I dont mind them coming much 
 but I think that they could be a bit  
 cleaner and look where they are going 
 on their horses and carts.Dawn Furniss</content>
