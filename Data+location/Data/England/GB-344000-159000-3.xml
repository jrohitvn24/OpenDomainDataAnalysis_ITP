		<content> There are two sub post offices        
 including general stores and a further
 three shops in the district.          
 Burrington village has no shops or    
 pubs. There are two Primary schools in
 the area for children under eleven, at
 Burrington and at Churchill Gate.     
 There is a large secondary school at  
 the west end of Churchill village.    
   The communities often provide their 
 own entertainments.There are two      
 parish halls and two parish churches. 
 The people are friendly, helping to   
 make it a pleasant area in which to   
 live. House prices are regarded as    
 being high. Old buildings have been   
 bought up in the past and renovated.  
 They are then regarded as being highly
 acceptable houses. Since they are     
 expensive, the population is becoming 
 more elderly.                         
                                       </content>
