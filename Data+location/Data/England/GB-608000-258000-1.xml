 the parish of Earl Stonham and parts  
 of Stonham Parva, Creeting St Peter,  
 Creeting St Mary and Stowupland. The  
 landscape is undulating, reaching 65  
 metres above sea level in th West,    
 falling to a minor tributary of the   
 River Deben in the South The soil is a
 fertile heavy clay, nearly all arable 
 land and intensively cultivated       
 producing wheat, barley, sugar beet,  
 oilseed rape peas and beans.          
 About 600 people live in the area,    
 most in the scattered hamlets of Earl 
 Stonham and about 200 in Stonham Parva
 which is concentrated on the Ipswich, 
 Norwich Road. The largest single      
 employer is a fruit packing           
 establishment in Earl Stonham and a   
 few people work on the local farms.   
 The majority however,travel to work in
 Ipswich, Stowmarket or Needham Market.</content>
