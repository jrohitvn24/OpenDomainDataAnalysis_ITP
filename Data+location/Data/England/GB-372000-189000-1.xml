		<title>01THE KINGSWOOD AREA</title>
		<content>  Our block lies in the flat land of   
 the Severn Vale just below the        
 Cotswold escarpment. Most of the land 
 is farmed, with dairy farming the main
 activity. The Gloucester-Bristol      
 railway line runs through the western 
 part of our block. The block includes 
 most of the village of Kingswood and  
 part of the village of Charfield.     
  About 1000 people live in Kingswood. 
 There is a primary school, a Post     
 Office/shop, two other shops, a       
 Church, a Chapel and a pub. There is a
 printing factory and a transport      
 haulage firm. The nearest town is     
 Wotton-under-Edge, a mile and a half  
 away. There is a sports centre and a  
 shopping centre at Yate, 7 miles away.
 The nearest cities are Bristol (16    
 miles) and Gloucester (18 miles).     
 Kingswood is a quiet friendly place.
