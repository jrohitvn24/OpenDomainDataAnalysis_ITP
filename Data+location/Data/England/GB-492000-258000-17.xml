		<title>17Staploe, Transport</title>
		<content> One public bus runs from Duloe and    
 Staploe to St. Neots on Thursdays and 
 until 1984 a privately commissioned   
 one from Honeydon. The parish council 
 have petitioned the bus company. With 
 everyone except farm workers moving   
 out to work, own transport is the     
 overriding necessity of residents. The
 road system developed from old farm   
 tracks, hollow ways and anclosure     
 roads. Sheaker's Way is too narrow for
 cars to pass normally, Honeydon's     
 roads are sunken, with blind corners  
 and steep banks. With the continued   
 growth of Eaton Socon, these roads are
 carrying increasingly inappropriate   
 traffic, avoiding congestion on the   
 old A1. The hamlets do not qualify for
 a speed limit. Accidents have         
 increased, cycling and walking        
 dangerous and rubbish is dumped and   
 the environment and habitat damaged.  </content>
