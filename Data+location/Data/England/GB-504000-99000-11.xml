		<content>        Sir Hubert Parry.              
   Knightcroft House, which backs onto 
 Sea Lane, Rustington, was divided into
 four flats forty years ago, but it was
 once the home of a great English      
 composer. A plaque in Sea Lane        
 commemorates him in these words:      
        Sir Hubert Parry               
           Musician                    
          (1848-1918)                  
           lived here                  
          (1879-1918)                  
{In this house he composed his setting 
{of Blake's poem, "Jerusalem."         
   He is famous not only as a composer 
 of music, especially choral works, but
 also as a writer about music. In our  
 school assemblies we still sing the   
 hymns "Jerusalem "and "Dear Lord and  
 Father of Mankind "to tunes which he  
 wrote.
