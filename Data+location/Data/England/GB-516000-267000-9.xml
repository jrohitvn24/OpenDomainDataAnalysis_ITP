		<title>09Huntindonshire Folklore</title>
		<content> Folklore has developed over the ages, 
 with each village having its own      
 traditions and customs.These generally
 differed from village to village,as   
 people rarely strayed further than    
 their own village. Some of the        
 expressions and customs of old        
 Huntingdonshire (which is no longer a 
 county) are remembered today. At      
 Buckden School we still celebrate May 
 Day with maypole dancing. Below are   
 some of the expressions which are     
 still used by our parents and         
 grandparents.                         
    { }                                
    {Docky}: mid day lunch.            
    {Bait} : food or a meal.           
    {All round Bill's mother }: a long 
              way round.               
    {Kosh }: a pea pod.                
    {Koshing }: podding peas.
