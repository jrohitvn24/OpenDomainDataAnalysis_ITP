		<title>14GLOSSOPDALE UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> In 1985 the number of unemployed is   
 rising rapidly and more facilities are
 needed for them.{      Hadfield Centre
 arranges{discos}and{fun nights}and the
 unemployed are let in at almost half  
 price. We rang Glossop Leisure Centre 
 to ask how much they reduced the      
 prices for the unemployed. We found   
 that in most cases the fee was reduced
 by half, eg. the normal fee for       
 badminton, volleyball, basketball and 
 tabletennis is{50p.}whereas a{UB40}   
 card holder pays{25p.}There are{2,244 
 unemployed in the Glossop area and as 
 the{average age}for an unemployed     
 person is between{20-29}this is a     
 useful project{reducing}the{cost}of   
 the sports they play. The number of   
 mill jobs has drastically decreased;  
 the main jobs that people do are in   
 the clothing,food,foam,and chemical   
 industries.                           </content>
