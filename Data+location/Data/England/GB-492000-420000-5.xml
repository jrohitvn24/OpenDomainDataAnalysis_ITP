		<content> The village of Winteringham is  situa-
 ted at  the  northern end of the lime-
 stone  ridge, Lincoln Edge, where  the
 escarpment  decends  northwards to the
 Humber.  The  village faces the Humber
 across which  are magnificent views of
 the Yorkshire Wolds, and, to  the east
 the span  of  the  Humber  Bridge. For
 centuries  the  village  looked to the
 Humber for  its livelihood in commerce
 and fishing.  The  Humber  is now only
 used from Winteringham for recreation.
 About 40% of the parish  stands on the
 limestone and is  quick  draining, the
 remainder  is  reclaimed marshland cut
 by drains.  A  high  embankment on the
 riverside, and  sluices in the drains,
 prevents access of salt river water to
 the land.  The  eastern  part  of  the
 village  is  in  the  Ancolme   valley
 across which  can  be seen the Lincoln
 Wolds.                                </content>
