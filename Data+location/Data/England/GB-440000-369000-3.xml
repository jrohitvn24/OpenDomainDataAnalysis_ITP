		<content>      HOUSING IN CALOW                 
 In Calow there are flats, bungalows,  
 semidetached,detached and rows of     
 terraced houses.As you drive along the
 main road-Top Road,most of the houses 
 are older and are privately owned.    
 Around school there are Council houses
 and bungalows for families and old    
 people.About 25% of the people are    
 pensioners and some live in a special 
 centre called Goodman Court and they  
 have a bell to ring a warden if they  
 need help.Near the churchyard new     
 flats, houses and bungalows are just  
 being finished,because there are      
 people wanting to move here,some are  
 perhaps going to work at the new      
 hospital.Some of our class do not like
 the idea of building them so near the 
 graveyard.
