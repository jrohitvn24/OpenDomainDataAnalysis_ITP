 Health Club.  These are special to our
 area:-{SURFING}A swimmer goes out to  
 deep water in the sea and when a big  
 wave comes he stands on his surfboard 
 riding on the wave towards the shore. 
{JOGGING}is a way of running slowly for
 a long distance. It is very popular in
 Newquay because of the health boom.   
 Many people jog in the morning to keep
 fit. {SWIMMING}We do a lot of swimming
 because of our sandy beaches and our  
 clear sea.  {FISHING}We fish from the 
 beach and from the rocks.  Our catches
 are usually Mackerel, Cod, Plaice and 
 Conger Eels.  Many tourists enjoy tak-
 ing part in these recreations.        </content>
