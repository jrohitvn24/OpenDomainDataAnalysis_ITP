		<title>07TADCASTER CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Every year in Tadcaster there is      
 a carnival with   brigtly coloured    
 floats representing things.Carnival   
 time is a nice time ,some floats throw
 sweets out ,there are dancers and     
 bands,stalls,competitions,raffles,    
 exhibitions,games and many other      
 things.                               
   The parade of floats is lead by the 
 Carnival Queen riding on Samuel       
 Smith's dray pulled by two shire      
 horses.                               
 If you are lucky enough you can get on
 a float with school or a club.I       
 remember when I was picked to go on   
 float with school.It was called the   
 Ugly Bug Ball .I was a snail. It was  
 cold that day I was glad my costume   
 was made out thick material. Even     
 though it was cold I enjoyed it all   
 the same .There was orange to drink   
 afterwards and wine for the grownups. </content>
