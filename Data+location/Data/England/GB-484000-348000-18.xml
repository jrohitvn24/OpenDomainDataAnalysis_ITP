		<title>18ALL ABOUT ME FROM CLAYPOLE</title>
		<content>       My name is Joanna Speir. I live 
 at Holme Farm near Claypole and was   
 born on June 6th 1976. I am nine years
 old. I have blue eyes and brown       
 hair and have to wear glasses. My     
 brother is six years old and is called
 James. My favourite colours are mauve 
 and pink.                             
       My hobbies are swimming,        
 snorkeling, diving, ballet and tap    
 dancing. I also go to Brownies and    
 have so far obtained ten badges. I    
 collect china animals and dolls.      
       I live on a farm which is mostly
 arable but we have some beef cattle.  
 We have a dog called Brandy, and used 
 to have two more called Scratch and   
 Spot.                                 
       I go to Claypole Primary School 
 as did my father. I have to come to   
 school by car every day because we    
 live in an outlying farmhouse.        </content>
