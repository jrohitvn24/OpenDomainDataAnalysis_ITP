 arable land, it is a mixture of large 
 and small farms.Most farmers keep a   
 few cows or sheep too.At the west side
 of our area is the small village of   
 Gipsey Bridge and on the eastern edge 
 is the slightly larger village of     
 Frithville.The area is drained fen    
 land and there are many drains the    
 largest of which is the West Fen Drain
 in Frithville.                        
              The houses are scattered 
 all across the square with a small    
 school and a Post Office in each      
 village.There is an agricultural      
 engineer, Crawford's at Frithville    
 which supplies tractors ,harvesters   
 etc.                                  
     The main centre for shopping,     
 business and entertainment is Boston  
 which is approx.5 miles away.
