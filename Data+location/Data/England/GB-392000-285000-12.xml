		<title>12BLACK COUNTRY ENTERTAINERS</title>
		<content> The Robin Hood Inn on Merry Hill, is  
 home to a group of entertainers whose 
 theme and raison d'etre is life in the
 Black Country, which they celebrate in
 song, poetry and humourous tales.  Jon
 Rasen has researched into the music   
 and folklore of the district, and has 
 produced several records and books on 
 the subject, and appeared on radio and
 TV.  Brian Clift, born in Netherton,  
 is a solo artist who sings the songs  
 of the area.  Tommy Mundon from       
 Halesowen also heard on radio and TV, 
 concentrates on comedy as does the    
 comediennne Dolly Allen.  Harry       
 Harrison, the veteran of the group,   
 has been writing dialect poems , now  
 numbered at over 1000, since 1938.    
 His funny and often thought_provoking 
 poems and tales, heard many times on  
 TV and radio, form an integral part of
 an evening with the troupe.           </content>
