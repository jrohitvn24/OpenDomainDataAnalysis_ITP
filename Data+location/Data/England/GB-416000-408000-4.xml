		<title>04New Industries in Shepley.</title>
		<content> In 1965 Victoria Mills closed down.   
 The premises remain and are almost    
 completely re-occupied by smaller     
 businesses. We visited several of     
 these. Victoria Glass was in a smaller
 unit and established two years ago. It
 is run by three people who buy glass  
 to make into sealed units for double  
 glazing. They also make plastic and   
 aluminium window frames and hope to   
 eventually expand. Transcontinental   
 Goldfish Company occupies a bigger    
 area and imports and sells a large    
 variety of fish. They also sell       
 domestic pets and are quite a local   
 attraction. Lastly we visited Sheply  
 Textile Machinery Merchants. This     
 large unit is used for storing        
 machines bought from mills which are  
 being demolished. Old machines are not
 actually restored here but the main   
 office is here.                       </content>
