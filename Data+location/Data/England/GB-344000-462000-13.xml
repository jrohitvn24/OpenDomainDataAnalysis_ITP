 The first survey was on children aged 
 12. On Saturday mornings 70% watch    
 television. Children enjoyed pop music
 and following the charts. The average 
 time for tea was 5.05pm and the       
 average time for bed was 9.40pm. 60%  
 of the children go jogging and        
 everyone enjoyed playing outside.     
          For the second survey several
 people under 40 were interviewed about
 how they spent their leisure time.    
 Here are our results: 6 read; 10      
 played sports; 14 watched T.V.; 8 go  
 walking; 6 go camping; 5 visit        
 relattions; 4 do gardening; 10 go to  
 the pub; 4 go to discos; and 9 play   
 on  computers. We found that the most 
 popular pastime was watching T.V. and 
 videos.
