		<title>03HOLYWELL'S 2nd EASTER FAYRE</title>
		<content>  On Saturday 20th April 1985 {Holywell
{Middle School}held its  second  annual
 Easter  Fayre.  The fun  started at 11
 o'clock, and the activities availiable
 included  crockery  smashing, numerous
 raffles  and  tombolas, train rides, a
 palmist,  various  stalls,  archery,  
 multi  coloured  hair  spraying, model
 aeroplane flying and  Morris  dancing.
 If  after  all  this you were  feeling
 hungry, you could win yourself a      
 coconut on the  coconut shy, try  some
 cakes, drop in at the  canteen or  buy
 some candy floss.                     
   Sadly  the  event was  marred by bad
 weather, and this was reflected in the
 turn out,however the organisers - the 
 parents  and   friends'  association -
 raised  much  needed  funds  for  the 
 School. The event ended at 4 o'clock.
