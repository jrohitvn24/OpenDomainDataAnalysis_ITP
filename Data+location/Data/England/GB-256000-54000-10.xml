  The whole area is dominated by the   
{A.38}which bisects it horizontally.   
 But the surrounding countryside is    
 criss-crossed with smaller roads.These
 of course are minor roads and as such 
 may only be{just one car width}in     
 places.This can lead to annoying      
 reversing which can be dangerous      
 especially as the roads are of a      
{twisty nature.}This procedure can be  
 even more hazardous due to the lush   
 vegetation growing along the edges    
 preventing easy viewing of vehicles.  
  These roads are generally well sign- 
 posted and this year new signs        
 proclaiming{"Leisure Drive"}have      
 already brought cries of concern with 
 the possibility of increased tourist  
 traffic bringing drivers who are      
 unused to these small lanes into the  
 area.                                 </content>
