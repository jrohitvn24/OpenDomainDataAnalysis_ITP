		<content>{   Paul's Field}was built in 1973 by  
 the local council to provide housing  
 for elderly people who can take care  
 of themselves but who may occasionally
 need help. We spoke to Mrs. Hunt, the 
 warden, who has been there for eight  
 years. There are fourteen flats and   
 three bungalows. The residents' ages  
 range from sixty-seven to eighty-nine.
    The flats consist of a lounge,     
 kitchen, bedroom, sitting-room and    
 bathroom. Each flat has an alarm and  
 an intercom system for talking to Mrs.
 Hunt, who is on call twenty-four hours
 a day. There is a pleasant communal   
 room where the residents can meet for 
 parties, bingo, or a song-song round  
 the piano.                            
    Mrs. Hunt does shopping and        
 collects pensions for the residents,  
 as well as looking after them when    
 they are ill.                         </content>
