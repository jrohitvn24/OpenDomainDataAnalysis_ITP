		<title>16WORK AND UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Many years ago people had to dig by   
 hand. The transportation of goods was 
 also done by man power. Today modern  
 machinery has taken over these jobs   
 creating unemployment in the area in  
 which we live. Some of the many jobs  
 which are left to do are things like  
 building houses, selling clothes and  
 food,working in an office for a       
 business or teaching in schools. There
 are some factories in our area e.g.   
 Heanor Gate industrial estate and     
 Morleys but there are still not enough
 jobs to go around everybody, and 14%  
 are unemployed. The opencast employs  
 many workers however, though this is  
 also declining.                       
 Now the people in our are have three  
 choices, either:                      
     1. Go on for further education,   
     2. Keep trying to get a job,      
 or  3. Sign on social security.       </content>
