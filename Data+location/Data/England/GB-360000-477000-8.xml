		<title>08HOUSING PROBLEMS IN KIRKBY</title>
		<content> As relatively few houses have been    
 built recently,property is in heavy   
 demand,especially as the{Lake District
 is so close.Many elderly people chose 
 to{retire}in the district which gives 
 an imbalance in the population.The    
 result is that house prices are high  
 but less than in the Lake District.   
 Most property is{owner-occupied,}but  
 some is available for renting.As the  
 number of aged has increased the      
 amount of sheltered accommodation has 
 developed.There is a demand for       
{tourist-orientated}businesses but few 
 come on the market.In recent years    
 there has been an increase in the     
 number of{holiday cottages,}either    
 occupied by one family or let as a    
 business proposition.These factors    
 make it difficult for young{married   
{couples}to find suitable accommodation
 and so tend to move away.             </content>
