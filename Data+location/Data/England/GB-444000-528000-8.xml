		<content> A19 TEST AND TUNE lies behind the     
 service station on the southbound     
 carriageway of the A19.It is          
 positioned in the country because     
 the A19 is useful for road testing    
 and testing and tuning might prove    
 too noisy for neighbours in a town.   
 The garage has been there for 10 years
 but the owner has been a tuning       
 specialist for 25 years.              
 The garage was specially built for    
 tuning and testing cars. Here the     
 latest diagnostic computer equipment  
 is used, the owner of the station     
 having undertaken a special course in 
 computing and mechanical skills.  Most
 of the work involves tuning cars for  
 large local firms although the owner  
 has in his time tuned speedboats,     
 motorbikes, buses and racing cars.
