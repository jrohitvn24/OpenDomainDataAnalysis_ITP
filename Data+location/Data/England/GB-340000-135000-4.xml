		<content> He told us though that most people in 
 this area make silage as this is good 
 food for both{dairy}and beef cattle.  
 Also many people now grow fodderbeet  
 for the same reasons.                 
  Mr Pleese has seen many changes in   
 his 30 years of{farming.}The first is 
 that milk used to be collected in     
 churns but now is collected in        
 tankers. Each of his cows produce 3   
 gallons per day. He only has 2 cows   
 which produce{milk,}but altogether has
 15. They check the milk weekly for    
 diseases and it's also tested for T.B.
 This test is done once a year. If the 
 animal shows any sign of containing   
 the disease it is{slaughtered}and the 
 government compensates the farmer.    
 Now, because of all these tests you   
 can drink milk safely straight from   
 the cow. Milk is tested weekly for    
 nutrition.                            </content>
