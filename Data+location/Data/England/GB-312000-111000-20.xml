		<title>20Local people.</title>
		<content> The population is a mixture of natives
 born and brought up in the area, and  
 people from other parts of the counrty
 who have moved in to the area because 
 of their work or, in many cases, to   
 retire. Many of the local people are  
 inter-related, there having been      
 little movement into the area until   
 the last twenty five to thirty years. 
 Local surnames are Clist, Doble, Hart,
 Blackmore, Pring, and Loman. The local
 Devon dialect is still common, Mrs. E.
 Clist of Mounshayne Farm being able to
 speak and write in dialect. Many of   
 the businesses are now owned by people
 who have moved into the area, with the
 notable exception of all the local    
 building firms many of which have been
 family run for many years. The Rector,
 Rev.A.C. Grosse, is not a native but  
 over the past fifteen years has become
 liked and respected in the locality.  </content>
