		<title>07Transport-Cookley Green Area</title>
		<content>Most people in this area own cars or   
rely on friends/neighbours to drive    
them for shopping.  As the area is     
sparsely populated the bus service is  
not good as it is uneconomical to run. 
The buses are run by a privately owned 
company subsidised by Oxfordshire C.C. 
This company also runs the school      
buses.  A bus from Russells Water to   
Henley calls at Cookley Green at 9am on
Tuesdays and Thursdays and returns by  
1pm.  The route from Watlington to     
Henley goes via Christmas Common on    
Tuesday Thursday Friday and Saturday.  
The bus leaves at 9.10am and returns by
12.30pm.  There is an extra bus on     
Thursday afternoon.  A route from      
Watlington to Reading gives four buses 
daily from Cookley Green except        
Wednesday when there are only three.
