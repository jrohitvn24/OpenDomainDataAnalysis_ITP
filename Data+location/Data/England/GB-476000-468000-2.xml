		<content> While racehorse training is an        
 important part of the area's          
 activities there are a number of other
 expanding industries connected to the 
 agricultural nature of the area. These
 include two bacon factories, a wool   
 grading plant, agricultural           
 engineering and a trout hatchery. A   
 bright steel works occupies a major   
 place in Norton-on-Derwent's          
 industrial scene.                     
                                       
 Within the area there are located     
 a number of organisations covering    
 practically interest from stamp       
 collecting to pigeon fancying and a   
 number of amateur operatic and drama  
 societies as well as brass bands. The 
 Norton Youth Brass provides a nursery 
 for promising youngsters in the       
 district.(continued)
