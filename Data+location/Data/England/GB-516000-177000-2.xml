		<title>02ST. ANNE'S CHURCH, KEW GREEN</title>
		<content> St. Anne's Church was built in 1714,  
 and stands in one corner of Kew Green 
 on land presented by{Queen Anne,}who  
 also gave{Â£100}towards the building   
 cost. This came to a total of{Â£500,   
 being less than the cost of the weekly
 upkeep today. The land was originally 
 marshland surrounded by fields, and   
 before the church was built people    
 worshipped in a chapel in the fields. 
                                       
 Some 250 people attend St. Anne's on a
 regular basis, representing under 3%  
 of the population of Kew. There are   
 three Sunday services, the main one   
 being held at 10 a.m. Several services
 are held during the week. On Sundays, 
 services are quite well attended, but 
 the weekday congregation tends to be  
 very small. Large numbers do attend   
 the Christmas and Easter services,    
 often as many as 600.                 </content>
