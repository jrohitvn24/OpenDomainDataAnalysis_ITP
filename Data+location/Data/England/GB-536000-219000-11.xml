		<title>11Day In The Life Of J.House</title>
		<content>  Junior House is the smaller of the   
 two preparatory schools at St.        
 Edmund's College.                     
  Boys living in Junior House are woken
 at 7.00 am for morning prayers and    
 mass.Afer this they have breakfast in 
 the main dining hall untill 8.15 am.  
 They return to the house where they   
 make their beds and tidy up their     
 dormitories under the supervision of  
 the House Matron.Between 8.30-9.00 am 
 the day boys and girls arrive in      
 coaches from places as far apart as   
 Stevenage,Bishops Stortford and North 
 London.The bell at 9.15 am heralds the
 start of the teaching day with two    
 classes up to break at 10.35.Morning  
 break is traditionally the Tuck Shop  
 time,again under the supervision of   
 Matron,with two pupils helping her.
