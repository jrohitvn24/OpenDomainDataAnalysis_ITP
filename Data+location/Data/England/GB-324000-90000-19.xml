    My name is Helen Littley and I am a
 pupil of Seaton Primary School. I am  
 11 years old. A typical day is as     
 follows.                              
    I wake up at about 7.45am. I have  
 breakfast which consists of a banana, 
 a slice of buttered toast and a glass 
 of orange juice. Dad drives me to     
 School on the way to the office.      
    School starts off with a morning   
 assembly. We have two breaks in the   
 day in which we play games like Hop   
 Scotch and Hey Presto.                
    School ends at 3.30pm. When dad    
 comes home we have dinner. After      
 dinner I go to Guides and we have     
 rounders and lots of trips and walks. 
 Guides starts at 7.00pm and ends at   
 9.00pm. I have a drink and then I go  
 to bed.                               </content>
