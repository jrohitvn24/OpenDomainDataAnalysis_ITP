		<title>05HOUSING EMMOTT'S FARM</title>
		<content> Emmotts Farm is 450 years old.        
 It was built in 1550 approximately.   
 The whole family of the Beachamps     
 who are living there now have been    
 living there 83 years.The walls used  
 to be made of Wattle and Daub but now 
 have been changed to brick.The roof is
 made of tiles.It used to be thatched. 
 The Beachamps don't know how many     
 families have lived there.Mr Emmott   
 brought Emmotts Farm in 1731 but never
 seemed to have lived there.Emmott's   
 Farm house was 2 cottages until       
 auctioned by descendants of Mr Emmott 
 in 1872.Lord Radnor bought it.A man   
 named Edmund Mack lived here in 1673  
 so we imagine this is why it is       
 called Mack's lane.All the different  
 animals that have been on the farm are
 horses,cattle,chickens,cats,dogs,and a
 rabbit.All the family have attended   
 the local school.                     </content>
