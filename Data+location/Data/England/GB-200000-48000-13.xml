		<title>13Coastal path near Porthpean</title>
		<content> We started at Duporth holiday village 
 and went south along the coastal path.
 There was a lot of wild flowers along 
 the path such as:Red campions,        
 Daffodils and Bluebells.On the way to 
 Porthpean we saw an old World War Two 
 lookout tower.From it we could see all
 of St.Austell Bay and a long way out  
 to sea.Next we walked across Porthpean
 beach,stopping only to admire the     
 view.We walked up the hill,through    
 several fields of sheep.We saw a ship 
 waiting to go into a harbour,it was   
 very careful not to get tangled in the
 lobster pots.When we got to Black Head
 ,we saw the firing range,and          
 fortunatlly there was nobody shooting 
 their so we went to see it at closer  
 detail.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
