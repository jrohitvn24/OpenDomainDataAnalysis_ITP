		<title>13THE CHINA CLAY INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> This industry only affects the eastern
 side of our area.Here as the land     
 rises into the granite mass of        
 Hensbarrow,the sand tips dominate the 
 scene.Once the traditional white      
 pyramids would have been seen here but
 with the expansion of the industry    
 since 1950 and as a result an increase
 of waste material,and an enviromental 
 demand these have changed to the huge 
 banks of sand which now extends over  
 miles.These banks rise to 30 metres or
 more and attempts have been made to   
 vegetate them with grasses,and lupins 
 which  thrive on the sand and make    
 them yellow in the flowering          
 season.Soay sheep have been used to   
 crop the areas quite successfully.The 
 hamlet of Scarcewater is not quite so 
 happy with the encroaching white,sandy
 mounds with complaints being heard.
