		<title>10A School Day 9.10am.-10.30am</title>
		<content> We arrive at school and go onto the   
 layground. When the bell is rung by   
teacher on duty at 9.10am. we line up  
until we are told to go in. Inside we  
hang up our coats and change into      
indoor shoes. We then sit down and read
a book whilst the registers are called.
When these have been done some people  
are told what work has to be done,     
whilst others like myself know what to 
do and can decide for ourselves the    
order in which we want to work.        
In the morning I usually choose to do  
maths before playtime. I have done     
basic maths this year which includes   
addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
fractions etc. I have also done a lot  
of practical maths connected with the  
class project. For example, I have     
tested the strength of card bridges and
concrete beams, and timed the speed of 
different moving things.               </content>
