		<title>11JUNIOR SCHOOL LIFE</title>
		<content>We start school at 9a.m. although some 
have to be there earlier as we have to 
do jobs such as giving out registers.  
At 9a.m. we go into our classroom.     
There are about 30 children of the same
age group.We have 4 age age groups,from
7 to 11 years.When we first start      
Junior School everything seems big and 
feel very scared,but when you are in   
the 4th year everything seems small.We 
have 4 lessons a day.In these lessons  
we just learn basics like reading,     
writing and maths.We have a swimming   
pool so we learn to swim.              
We have a daily Assembly when the      
Headmaster talks to us.We play a       
variety of sports;Football,Athletics   
Netball,Rugby and Chess.There are also 
after school clubs run by the teachers 
for Dancing, Table Tennis and and      
Benchball.We have 2 breaks and a lunch 
hour each day.                         </content>
