		<content> The area is lucky in having a man and 
 wife team of doctors living and       
 working in Campden as well as doctors 
 from outside allowing a wide choice.  
 Those in need of hospital treatment   
 are sent to Stratford or Cheltenham.  
 In the Campden area approximately 30  
 people need the help of the District  
 Nurse who also has two helpers. This  
 number will increase as time passes   
 because many elderly people do not    
 originate from Campden and have no    
 family nearby to call on in a crisis. 
 The local dentist has a surgery in    
 Campden and he also makes house calls 
 on the elderly and infirm. A weekly   
 surgery is held by a chiropodist who  
 also does housecalls. Those who need  
 psychiatric help are visited and so   
 are those in need of physiotherapy.   
 The local chemist dispenses medicines.
