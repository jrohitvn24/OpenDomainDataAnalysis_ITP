		<title>18THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is a very small rural one, 
 it has got 96 pupils in three         
 classes.It has a large field and quite
 a small playground. The school is new,
 it was rebuilt last year and we have  
 only been in here one year.Two of the 
 classrooms were built in 1860 but the 
 rest of the school was built from new.
 Our school has got a red high pitched 
 roof and orange bricks.               
 There is a large library,or           
 information centre and the computer is
 kept in there as well.                
 Our school is very modern, with lots  
 of new equipment. In the hall through 
 the window you can see sheep and      
 horses grazing on farmer Jones'       
 fields.                               
 Most of the children come to school on
 the school bus or by car because the  
 school serves a very large rural area.
