		<title>18A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> When I get up in the morning I go     
 downstairs to have my breakfast. I    
 usually have cornflakes with milk.    
 Then I go upstairs to get dressed. If 
 it's a school day I wear my school    
 clothes but if it's a weekend I wear  
 jeans and a jumper. Then I clean my   
 teeth. On Saturday we usually go      
 shopping to buy next week's food, and 
 then we come home for our dinner. We  
 grow most of our vegetables in our    
 garden. After dinner we sometimes play
 with our friends, or we might go out  
 with our parents. We come home for tea
 at about 6.00 and then we might watch 
 the television or read until bedtime. 
 If it's summer we can go out to play  
 again, but in the winter it gets dark 
 too early.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
