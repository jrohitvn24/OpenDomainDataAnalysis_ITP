		<content> Our area contains no towns or         
 villages, although there are homes    
 within it. It is entirely inside the  
 boundary of the North York Moors      
 National Park and contains Forstry    
 Commission conifer plantations,       
 farmland,  rough grazing and          
 heather-clad moorland.                
                                       
 Several long-distance footpaths cross 
 this area and from the highest point  
 the whole of the Teesside Industrial  
 complex as far as Hartlepool bay can  
 be seen on a clear day.               
                                       
 Because there are no villages and few 
 services, and because the roads tend  
 to be impassable when there has been  
 snow, the people who live here usually
 work here too.  Those who commute to  
 Teesside tend to live in villages on  
 lower ground.                         </content>
