		<content>{Football.}This is a game where you    
 have two sides of eleven players a    
 rectangular field,and two nets which  
 are two poles with netting in between 
 You also need a football which is a   
 big round leather shape.Each side has 
 to score a goal which is when the ball
 goes into the other sides net.When you
 finish the side with the most goals   
 has won.{Ice cream}is a game when one 
 person is on.All the other people who 
 are playing start a few metres away   
 behind the person who is on.They all  
 have to try to get to where to the    
 single person is standing.This person 
 has to look the opposite way.He can   
 turn round when he likes if he sees   
 anyone moving they have to start      
 again.If someone succeeds they shout  
 ice cream and they are now on.
