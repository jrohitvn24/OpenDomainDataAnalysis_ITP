		<content>{Working day on the farm.              
 My dad gets up at 5 to 5.30 and gets  
 dressed into his farming clothes,has a
 cup of tea and goes to work on his    
 bike.Then he might take some bags of  
 cake(calf rearing cake) out to the    
 moor in the milking parlour, come back
 and hitch up the smallish tank to     
 the trailer and go milking. He comes  
 back about 9.30am and empties the milk
 into the big bulk tank which will then
 be sucked up into the milk tanker when
 it calls.He will have breakfast then  
 perhaps move some cattle or sheep,    
 collect bales of hay.Then clean out   
 the bulk tank,go milking again and    
 come back for tea at 5.00.In winter he
 would have to see to the straw bedding
 for the cows in the cubicles. The yard
 would have to be scrapped clear of    
 slurry and put in the pit. In spring  
 it would be used as field fertiliser. </content>
