		<title>10Colehill Fun Run</title>
		<content> On Sunday, l9th May, l985, about one  
 hundred people went to Cannon Hill    
 Woods to join in the Fun Run.  Some of
 them were going to run five miles and 
 some were going to run ten miles.  My 
 mum and uncle ran ten miles.  They all
 started in the woods and it took about
 ten minutes to do one lap.  A week or 
 so before the run everyone had a      
 racing pack which held their number   
 and a plan of the route.  Some wore   
 track suits and others wore shorts and
 vests.  Everyone had a number.  The   
 run was started by someone shouting   
 "Go" through a loudspeaker.  The      
 winner was the person with the most   
 sponsors, but everyone got a sew-on   
 badge.  All the money went to "Save   
 the Children Fund".  People were      
 watching all around the course, and I 
 enjoyed it very much.
