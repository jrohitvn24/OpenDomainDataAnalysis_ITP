		<content> P.C. Gallantry is our{community       
 policeman A community policeman is one
 who only works in a certain area all  
 of the time.He beat starts at Fabian  
 Rd it is bordered by Church Lane and  
 then it extends as far as the docks.  
 The worst area on his patrol is Dalton
 Rd and Cumberland Rd.It is a hard area
 to  police and has suffered a lot of  
 vandalism because it has no static    
 population.The people keep moving out 
 and other people move in so that P.C. 
 Gallantry cannot get to know these    
 people so he cannot help them. P.C.   
 Gallantry works his own hours every   
 day,but he has to work a total of     
 40hrs per week.He deals with valuable 
 thefts under Â£200 and criminal        
 damage.To find out about crimes which 
 have been committed he reports to     
{South Bank}police station.
