		<content> Most of the houses in the area are of 
cottage type and are about 150-200 yrs 
old.A very small proportion of these   
are "tied" houses ,occupied by farm    
workers,although originally most of the
cottages would have come within this   
category.Now they are much sought after
as "period" homes &amp; are "modernised" by
their owners -often being colour-washed
in the traditional Suffolk Pink.Most   
would originally have been thatched,but
today only a few retain their thatch-  
notably those in Brandeston Street-the 
rest having been tiled.                
 There are several large Georgian/Vict-
orian type houses in the area &amp; at     
least 2 sizeable Halls-one at          
Kettleburgh and one at Brandeston,the  
latter now being used as a preparatory 
school,with a residential development  
adjoining it for staff and pupils
