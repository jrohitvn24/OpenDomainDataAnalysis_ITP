		<content>{ Fifty years ago}most of the men and  
 boys worked on one of the{five farms  
 in the parish, earning at most thirty 
 shillings a week.Boys would begin     
 bird-scaring or taking the cows out to
 pasture, then they would work with the
 big flocks of sheep or the horses.    
 There were twenty or thirty big       
 working horses who did all the        
 ploughing and pulling the carts.Some  
 steam engines were used, but most     
 machinery was horse drawn.            
  Work started at six in winter and    
 five in the summer and at harvest time
 went on until it was dark, a long day 
 for the fourteen year old school      
 leavers.                              
  Shepherds would walk miles with the  
 flocks across the Downs, with a dog   
 for company.
