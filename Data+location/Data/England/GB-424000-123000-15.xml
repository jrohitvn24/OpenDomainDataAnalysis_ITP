		<title>15A Day In My Life-Child,9 yrs</title>
		<content> Yawn! Iam getting up.It is a Thursday.
 Oh no, it is a school day. I get up,  
 make my bed, go downstairs &amp; have my  
 breakfast. Then I wash the pets, my   
 mum goes to work &amp; Daddy takes us to  
 school.We play until the bell, then go
 to our classrooms to do the register. 
 When we have finished Assembly we go &amp;
 do some work. At playtime we have a   
 small bottle of milk for 5p., orange, 
 lemon or blackcurrant for 10p. or soup
 for 12p. When we go in after play we  
 go into our classroom &amp; change to a   
 different job &amp; we work very hard as  
 usual.The dinner bell is at 12 p.m.   
 Some have school dinners, some have   
 sandwiches. ***** at 3 p.m. we say the
 prayer, say Good-Afternoon to our     
 teacher &amp; go home.***About 4.15 we go 
 to Brownies in Landford, where we have
 a good time. Then we go home, have our
 tea &amp; go to bed.(***=Abbreviations)   </content>
