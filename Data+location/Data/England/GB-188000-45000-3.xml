		<content>{Probus Village Now and Then contd.}   
 Increased road traffic is the main    
 effect of the tourist trade in        
 Probus,with no pedestrian crossing in 
 spite of requests.A restaurant &amp;      
 antique shop have also opened.        
   The junior school has 96 pupils,    
 using the old chapel school built in  
 1902.Secondary pupils are bussed else_
 where.Over 50 years ago there were 4  
 schools:church &amp; chapel with one each,
 a boarding school for about 120 boys &amp;
 a small school for about 12 girls.    
   There are now no regular circus or  
 fair visits with elephants parading   
 through the street,but the new villa_ 
 ge hall built in 1977 provides a      
 centre for various activities,eg.     
 dancing,drama &amp; badminton;Brownies,   
 Guides,a sunshine club for the over   
 60's &amp; regular fund raising whist     
 drives.                               </content>
