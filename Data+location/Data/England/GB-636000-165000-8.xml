		<title>08PRIMARY LEISURE SURVEY</title>
		<content> A survey of how primary school        
 children spend their leisure time     
 showed that in school the predominant 
 playground games are football,chasing 
 or skipping.Seasonal variations       
 include conkers,hopscotch,marbles and 
 foot cricket although these are not as
 popular as a few years ago.           
 Most leisure time was spent watching  
 television with only about 20% taking 
 part in clubs outside school.Of these 
 about a half attend Brownies or cub   
 scouts with only a few belonging to   
 other youth organisations.            
 A little over 20% of children asked   
 attended church- mainly Anglican.An   
 increasing number of children have    
 access to a home computer and over 50%
 have their own television set.Many    
 children now watch video films instead
 of or as well as regular programmes.
