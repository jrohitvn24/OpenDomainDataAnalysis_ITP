		<title>08Yarm Parish Council</title>
		<content> In 1894 Yarm Parish Council was       
 established.                          
            The idea of the Parish     
 Council originated in{feudal}times.In 
 todays council the nine councillors   
 who are elected meet in the{Town Hall 
 every second Tuesday of the month.    
  Todays Council looks after a{cemetery
 and the{allotments.}They pay someone  
 to dig{graves}and keep the cemetry    
 in good condition.50 years ago people 
 lived in small cottages with no       
 toilets or running water or garden,so 
 they had allotments.                  
   Yarm Parish Council is also         
 responsible for{Yarm Fair.}Today the  
 Parish Council still get money from   
 the people who own stalls and they use
 it to improve the area.               
  {Stockton Borough Council}also ask   
 for their opinion about planning      
 application, footpaths and so on.     </content>
