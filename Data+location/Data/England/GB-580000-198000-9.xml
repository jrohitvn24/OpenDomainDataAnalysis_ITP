		<content>    The church is a conspicuous land   
 mark in Stow Maries. It can be seen   
 for many miles especially when the red
 cross which surmounts the white spire 
 is lit up.                            
    About a dozen worshippers regularly
 attend Sunday service. Stow Maries is 
 part of the much larger parish of Cold
 Norton and Purleigh. The Rev. Tillett 
 is  minister over the whole area. The 
 Blessed Sacrament is kept in the      
 church and the services are more akin 
 to the orthodox church.               
    There has been a church on the site
 since Norman times but the body of the
 present church is 500 years old       
 although the altar is 650 years old.  
 The bell is  300 years old and the    
 pews are 100 years old. The first     
 burial recorded was of Emma White in  
 1560 and the first marriage was       
 between Henry &amp; Hannah in 13.8.1837.  </content>
