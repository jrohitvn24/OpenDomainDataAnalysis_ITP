		<content> My radio wakes me up for my morning   
 paper round.About 6.20 I arrive at the
 newsagents and start my round.After   
 this I will have my breakfast and get 
 ready for school.                     
 I catch the bus to the Ramsey Ailwyn  
 at about 8.20a.m. and we arrive at    
 8.55a.m.There are 8 lessons in the day
 and always consist of at least one    
 lesson of maths and one lesson of     
 english.The bell for end of school    
 rings at 4.00 O'clock.When I get home,
 I have a packet of crisps and a drink 
 and watch television.                 
 Later on I have my tea which usually  
 consists of meat and potatoes and a   
 vegetable.After I go out,I do my      
 homework or watch television.It varies
 on what time I go to bed depending on 
 whats on television. By
