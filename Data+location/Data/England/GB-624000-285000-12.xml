		<title>12Transport in Albrugh</title>
		<content> Communications in Albrugh is mainly by
 private car. Virtually all households 
 have one car with some having two.    
 Public transport is limited to one    
 shoppers bus a week and the community 
 bus - driven by trained volunteers to 
 the surrounding villages, Denton      
 Harleston, Bungay and Norwich. Other  
 outtings are organised as they are    
 required.                             
 Children are collected and brought    
 home form school by hired coach daily 
 execpt for those living less than 1\  
 miles away who make their own way by  
 foot or cycle or parents car.         
 The main road serving the area  is the
 A143 Diss to Gt Yarmouth road from    
 which Albrurgh traffic must turn for  
 the last mile or so.                  
 Very little walking is done in the    
 area and footpaths are fast becoming  
 over grown and lost.                  </content>
