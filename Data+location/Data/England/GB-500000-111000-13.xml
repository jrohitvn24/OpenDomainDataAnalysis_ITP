		<title>13DOWNLAND FARMING IN AMBERLEY</title>
		<content> Downs Farm has been farmed by members 
 of the Lee and Strudwick family for   
 over 50 years. It was originally      
 rented from the Parham and Norfolk    
 Estates and was gradually bought over 
 the years. Today it is farmed by 7    
 family  members helped by one full    
 time and one part time person.        
 The farm tries to be self sufficient. 
 It has a dairy and beef herd. Sheep   
 are no longer grazed as it is more    
 profitable for fields to be enlarged  
 and ploughed to grow Spring and Winter
 Barley and wheat.                     
 The female calves are for milking and 
 male ones sold for beef. The Wild     
 Brooks are cropped for sileage then   
 grazed in summer. Winter Barley is    
 grown on high ground for winter food, 
 Spring Barley is sold for malting.    
 Wheat grown on lower wetter soil is   
 their main cash crop.                 </content>
