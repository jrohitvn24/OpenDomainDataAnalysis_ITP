		<content> Whitchurch has enough{shops}but people
 go to Chester or Shrewsbury to get    
 clothes,family presents and other     
 things.Some of the smaller shops don't
 take advantage of being small,they    
 don't make them interesting and tidy. 
 Every shop in Chester and Shrewsbury  
 is interesting to attract more        
 customers. At{the market}there are 30 
 stalls most have been there over 10   
 years half are food stalls.Most of    
 the buyers do not come from Whitchurch
 and come to the market regularly.All  
 the stall owners had stalls on other  
 markets 2 had shops as well.Some stall
 owners came a long way to the market. 
 No stall owners had other jobs and    
 most owned stalls on other markets.   
{Tesco supermarket}was built in 1982.It
 used to be a car park.People use Tesco
 regularly.It is easier to shop at     
 Tesco than going to the little shops. </content>
