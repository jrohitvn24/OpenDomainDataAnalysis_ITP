		<title>09LONGFORD PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> LONGFORD SCHOOL WAS BUILT IN 1875 AND 
 IT COULD HOLD 104 CHILDREN . THERE IS 
 ALSO A HOUSE WHICH THE SCHOOL MASTER  
 USED TO LIVE IN. IT WAS JOINED ON TO  
 THE SCHOOL. SO THAT THE SCHOOL MASTER 
 COULD JUST WALK IN TO HIS OFFICE AT   
 SCHOOL TIME,THERE WAS A DOOR FROM HIS 
 HOUSE STRAIGHT INTO THE SCHOOL. BUT   
 NOW THE HOUSE HAS BEEN SOLD TO A      
 PRIVATE OWNER THE DOOR HAS BEEN       
 BLOCKED OFF FROM THE SCHOOL. NOWADAYS 
 THERE ARE ABOUT 60 CHILDREN IN THE    
 SCHOOL. THESE DAYS WE NEED MORE SPACE 
 SO A WHOLE NEW INFANT UNIT HAS BEEN   
 BUILT ON. LONGFORD SCHOOL HAS A BUS   
 THAT GOES TO LOTS OF VILLAGES TO BRING
 THE CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. THE VILLAGES  
 ARE, YEAVELEY, LONGFORD, RODSLEY,     
 HALES GREEN AND ALKMONKTON. CHILDREN  
 ALSO COME FROM HOLLINGTON, LOWER      
 THURVASTON, AND SUTTON-ON-THE-HILL.
