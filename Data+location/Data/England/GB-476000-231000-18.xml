		<content>{Pop Music}                            
 Pop Music is one of the main interests
of the young people of Great Horwood.  
Two of the favourite groups are Duran  
Duran and Wham. Top of the Pops is one 
of the most popular television         
programmes.                            
{Magazines}                            
 There are magazines for all ages. The 
younger children like comics such as   
{Beano},{Dandy},{Twinkle},{Bunty} and  
{Playhour}.Whereas the older children  
prefer magazines such as {My Guy},     
{Girl}, {Jackie} and {Smash Hits}.The  
latter is the most popular amongst the 
twelve year olds.                      
{Make Up}                              
 Make Up was once an interest strictly 
for girls, but the fashion for male pop
stars to wear it has led to the boys   
trying to copy {Boy George}.
