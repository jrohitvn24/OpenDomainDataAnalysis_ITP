		<content> As most of this area is heather       
 moorland, the{shooting season}is very 
 important.  Grouse shooting (Aug 12-  
 -Dec 10th), Partridge(Sept 1-Feb 1st),
 Pheasant (Oct 1-Feb 1st),and snipe    
 (12th-Jan 31st).  Black game and hares
 are also shot.                        
 Four{gamekeepers}are employed to      
 keep down vermin, stoats, weasels,    
 foxes, carrion crows and magpies.     
 Heather is burnt regularly to         
 encourage new growth.  The shooting   
 rights are at present owned by  Arabs 
 from  Dubai, but they shoot no more   
 than 28 days a year.                  
 There are 5-6 drives a day.  each     
 shooter stands in a butt with his     
 loader. Two guns are used             
 alternately.  Lots are drawn for which
 butt is used.  The birds belong to the
 owner of the land and the first grouse
 shot are sent immediately to London.  </content>
