		<title>15SCOTTS HOUSE FARM</title>
		<content> Scotts house farm  in Gosforth has 110
 acres of land. It is owned by Mr.     
 Leech, the Builder. Mr. Oliver is the 
 tenant-farmer.                        
 There is farm house and two cottages. 
 There is no mains electricity so they 
 have  a big generator for the houses  
 and a small one for the farm          
 machinery.                            
 The farm has 5 tractors and 2 combines
 and until 1960 was a dairy farm. Then 
 there was a change to arable farming. 
 Three years ago beef cattle were      
 introduced so now it is a mixed farm. 
 There are 30 cows, 20 calves and 1    
 bull. This year's crops are spring and
 winter barley, wheat, peas, grass,    
 potatoes and rape.                    
 It is planned to put more acreage put 
 to grass to increase the fertility of 
 the land as continual use of          
 fertilisers make it sterile.          </content>
