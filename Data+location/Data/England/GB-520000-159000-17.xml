		<title>17EPSOM PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>{Epsom Parish Church is dedicated to   
{St.Martin of Tours and dates back to  
{before the Domesday survey.}Since 1058
 the church has been rebuilt 3 times.  
 In 1908 Sir Charles Nicholson rebuilt 
 most of the church.                   
 There are many interesting things to  
 see within the church's grounds, for  
 example the{Vinegar Bible,}printed in 
 1717 in Oxford. This was one of the   
 largest and costliest additions of    
 the Bible ever printed. It gets its   
 name from a printing error in the     
 parable of the "vinegar".             
 There is also an old Spanish, mahogany
 chest, beautifully carved, which was  
 salvaged from the old Nonsuch Palace. 
 The stone font dates from around 1460.
 The church is heavily involved in     
 contributing to charity and one of its
 latest appeals has been for the       
 Ethiopian famine.                     </content>
