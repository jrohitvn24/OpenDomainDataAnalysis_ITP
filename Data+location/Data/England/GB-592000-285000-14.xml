		<title>14Gravel Objections, Bridgham</title>
		<content> The grounds for Bridgham's strongest  
 objections to the gravel extraction   
 proposal (see page 13) are:           
                                       
 - that our quiet village would be     
 completely ruined by the dirt, dust,  
 traffic, noise and vibration of this  
 huge industrial intrusion;            
 - that the forest amenity would be    
 ruined for us and for holidaymakers by
 constant use of Forest Track 76 by    
 gravel lorries and that footpaths and 
 campsites would be lost;              
 - that forest and river wildlife would
 be destroyed by noise, traffic and    
 pollution;                            
 - that the village would never be free
 of extraction, for deposits are more  
 extensive than initially indicated;   
 - that regional gravel supplies are   
 already adequate.
