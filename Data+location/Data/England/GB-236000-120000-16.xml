		<title>16THE CHAPEL</title>
		<content>  The chapel was built in 1818 it is   
 made of big stones. It has five rooms 
 the kitchen, Sunday School room, main 
 room, toilets and the hall way. We    
 have lots of services and different   
 preachers do it every week. The grave 
 yard is opposite the chapel, Christine
 Hicks takes the Sunday School most of 
 the time. We have youth club there    
 sometimes, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Priest take it. 
 The Minister is called the Reverend   
 David Hart. We have fellow_ship there 
 every fortnight. I go to Sunday School
 and my friend Lucy used to go but she 
 got a bit bored with it.
