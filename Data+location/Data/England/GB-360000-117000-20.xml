		<content> There are a number of{Public Footpaths
 and{Bridleways}in the area. Originally
 many of these connected outlying      
 hamlets with village centres, or were 
 direct routes from cottages to the    
 farms or, like{Trent Path,}from the   
 village into the town. Nowadays these 
 are used mainly for{recreational      
{purposes}and although some become very
 overgrown during late summer, there   
 are enough in good condition to make  
 some lovely{walks.}
