  "Village altered tremendously. Old   
 village gone, most to Unstone Green.  
 Apperknowle and Hundall too, all gone.
  "I remember Unstone station. Everyone
 went to Chesterfield or Sheffield by  
 train.Sixpence return. People walked  
 four miles from Marsh Lane to catch   
 Sheffield train to work, walk home    
 evening.Traffic mostly horse and cart.
  "Several pits in area,lots of outcrop
 working. Don't remember cable-ways,   
 but tip was landmark. There for years,
 now gone. Remember church being built.
 Don't know what to make of present    
 times. Not much future for village."  </content>
