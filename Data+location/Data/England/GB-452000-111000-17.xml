		<content>   Yesterday I woke up and lay in for  
 about 15 mins. then I got up and went 
 downstairs. Dad was already up because
 it was 7.45a.m. I put some milk into  
 the microwave and set it at 2, but    
 that was too much and it all bubbled  
 over. By that time mum was up and she 
 cleaned it up while I put my Weetabix 
 in a bowl. I watched T.V.while eating 
 my breakfast. Then I went upstairs and
 put on my jogging suit and went into  
 the garden and rode my red bike. After
 this we played schools.After a picnic 
 lunch I put on my Brownie uniform to  
 march in the St. George's Day Parade. 
 After the march we sang the National  
 Anthem. When we got home it was quite 
 late and after our chicken dinner I   
 put on my nightie and went to bed.
