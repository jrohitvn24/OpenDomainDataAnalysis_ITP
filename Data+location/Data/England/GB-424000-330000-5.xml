 A welldressing is a picture made with 
 natural materials providing the       
 colour.  Before anything is done the  
 boards are put in the lake to soak for
 a week. Then mums and dads and        
 children come to puddle. This means   
 mixing a bag of clay with a pound of  
 salt and water in a tin bath. You walk
 up and down in bare feet until it is  
 all mixed in. Then it is put on to the
 boards and spread evenly. A large     
 paper pattern is placed on the clay   
 and pricked out until the picture     
 looks like a huge dot to dot.         
 Aldercones and coffee beans are used  
 to outline. Dry materials like fluor  
 spar, wood and seeds are put in       
 first.Last of all the individual      
 petals are put in. This year our      
 school well design was about          
 protecting wildlife.                  </content>
