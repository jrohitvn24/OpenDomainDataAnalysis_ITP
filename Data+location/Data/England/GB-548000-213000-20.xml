		<title>20Sawbridgeworth-New Crossing.</title>
		<content> The burning issue affecting           
 Sawbridgeworth in the Summer of 1985  
 is the new{automatic barriers}across  
 the London-Cambridge Railway Line at  
 Station Road.The railway crossing used
 to have gates,but now has automatic   
 half barriers.These only come down on 
 the on-coming traffic side of the     
 road,leaving the other side           
 open.People are worried that          
 children,blind people and animals     
 might unknowingly go on to the        
 line and get killed.People have got up
 petitions and meetings have been held 
 with railway officials,but so far     
 nothing has been done about it.       
                                       
 The "Domesday" Text has been written  
 by children from two schools:
