		<content> An interview with Mrs Dakin.          
                                       
 Mrs. Dakin has lived in the area for  
 37 years and was a teacher in Suttons 
 Primary.  She is very knowledgeable   
 about the area. She told us that St.  
 George's Hospital, which lies close to
 the school, was once a WORKHOUSE.  The
 bungalows that border the school are  
 all new and the wood-store that was   
 close by disappeared years ago.  Mrs. 
 Dakin told us about the things that   
 she enjoyed as a young woman.  She    
 would pay 2 old pennies to get into   
 the cinema and often went to church   
 where she talked and did some         
 needlework.  Jobs are harder to find  
 today than when she was younger, but  
 Mrs. Dakin much prefers today's       
 fashions.  Clothes are easier to look 
 after and are much more attractive    
 than they used to be. SUTTONS SCHOOL. </content>
