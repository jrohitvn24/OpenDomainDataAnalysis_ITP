		<title>08Entertainment in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Although Eccleshall has no theatre or 
 cinema, popular entertainment thrives 
 from early days when children at the  
 Lonsdale school are encouraged to     
 participate in plays and concerts.    
 This tradition is continued at the    
 Middle School, where plays are per-   
 formed regularly and carol services   
 held in church every Christmas with   
 readings by the pupils. Church con-   
 certs are extremely poular with local 
 residents, and are held often, enter- 
 taining and raising money. Occasion-  
 ally a professional organist is invit-
 ed to use the church's magnificent    
 organ, but generally the musicians,   
 singers and actors are local people;  
 Eccleshall boasts soloists of dist-   
 inction, both singers and instrument- 
 alists. In addition various programmes
 are arranged by the Players, Singers, 
 Handbell ringers + Barbershop Quartet.</content>
