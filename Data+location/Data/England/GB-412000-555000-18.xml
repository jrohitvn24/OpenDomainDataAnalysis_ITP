		<title>18A CHILD IN CHOPWELL WOODS</title>
		<content>   My name is Jill. I have a brother   
 called Ian. Four years ago we moved   
 into Chopwell Woods. I live in a small
 hamlet with fourteen people living in 
 six houses. My brother and I are the  
 only children, apart from two who are 
 sixteen and eighteen.                 
   Our house has 19 rooms. It was built
 in 1907. There are bats in our loft.  
 My Dad once found a soldier's button  
 there. We have a 1 acre garden with   
 over 30 trees.                        
   Chopwell Woods is 800 acres. Two    
 years ago a fire burned down a lot of 
 trees. It took 17 fire engines to put 
 the fire out.                         
   In the winter I sometimes see deer  
 and rabbits, and squirrels in spring. 
 I sometimes hear an owl. I have 20    
 pets - 4 ducks, 13 doves, 2 dogs and a
 rabbit.
