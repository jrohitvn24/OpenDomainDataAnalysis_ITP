		<title>19DUCKS ON THE RIVER</title>
		<content>   There are many ducks on the river   
 Stour, and fish.  I go fishing there  
 every Saturday morning to catch       
 tadpoles.  Once I caught this creature
 that that was a stick but it moved.   
 I never found out what it was because 
 it died.                              
   Last Christmas we were fishing and  
 three big swans came swimming down    
 the river ready to take off over Iford
 Bridge and one swan got hit by a car  
 bonnet.  The driver drove on but we   
 ran over to see if it was all right.  
 It died so someone telephoned the     
 RSPCA and they took it away.          
   There are lots of different kinds of
 trees and bushes along the river bank 
 which are very attractive to look at, 
 the one I like best is a fallen tree  
 because it is easy to climb.
