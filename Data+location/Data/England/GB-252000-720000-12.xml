		<title>12TOURISM IN BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> Over 10,000 people per year come along
 Balquhidder Glen to visit Rob Roy's   
 grave in the old churchyard adjacent  
 to the church. Very few tourists can  
 be accommodated in the village, so    
 most are passing through. The single  
 track road with its passing places has
 more traffic than it can comfortably  
 take in the summer months. Facilities 
 are few but in recent years a caravan 
 site has mushroomed on Loch Voil and  
 another one is planned on the site of 
 the old Balquhidder railway station.  
 Recently opened eating places add to  
 the interest, with Ledcreich Hotel    
 offering the connoisseur haute cuisine
 as well as luxury accommodation, and  
 the Golden Larches Restaurant offering
 good home fare. Self catering         
 accommodation, mainly in converted    
 farm steadings, is increasing and is  
 in very great demand.                 </content>
