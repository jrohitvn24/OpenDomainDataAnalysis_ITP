		<content>I live in Sandalwood Close near my     
school,Ben Jonson.It is off Harford St.
near Poplar Ambulance Station.It is a  
very quiet place to live.The houses are
modernish,maisonettes,houses and flats.
The people who live near me are a mix- 
ture of white and black but there are  
no Asians.They are reasonably happy and
get on well together.There are quite a 
few children between the ages of 4 and 
12 living in my block,James House.Most 
of us go to the same school.We have a  
games playing area in our Close where  
we can play most games like football,  
tennis,cricket and rounders.At the back
of James House there is a swing on a   
tree that Jason Wright and I made.It is
a great place to live because most of  
my friends live nearby and there are 2 
beautiful Yorkshire Terriers which I   
play with.
