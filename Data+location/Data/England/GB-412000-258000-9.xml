		<content>    Most of our area is covered in     
 fields. There are tracks through the  
 fields and some have barns in them.   
 The following is a list of farms in   
 this area; Hill Farm, Labrador Farm,  
 Folly Farm, Holyoake Farm, Glebe Farm,
 Wheathill Farm, Nells Farm, Lower     
 Farm, Redlands Farm, Silesbourne Farm 
 and last Retreat Farm.                
    The soil is often heavy clay. The  
 fields are typically divided by hedges
 into 6 acre lots. Roughly 40% is      
 for wheat 25% of the fields are for   
 silage, 25% is for oilseed rape, 10%  
 is for grazing sheep and cattle.      
    Recently some farms have removed   
 hedgerows and put in land drains.
