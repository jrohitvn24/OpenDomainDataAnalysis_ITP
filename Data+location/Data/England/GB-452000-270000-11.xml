		<title>11The Cricket Club</title>
		<content> Barby Cricket Club is probably the    
 most active club in Barby. There is a 
 mens, a ladies and a youth team.  The 
 men play in the Advertiser League and 
 the youth in the Avon league. Only two
 people from outside Barby are allowed 
 to play in each team. This is a bit   
 mean on Kilsby people as they haven't 
 got a pitch of their own. The Cricket 
 Club hold many social functions and   
 are a focus for many social           
 activities. In Kilsby the Tennis Club 
 and School Association often carry out
 this social role.                     
   There is also a senior Hockey Club  
 and recently a hockey club has been   
 formed. the Hockey Pitch is being made
 at the moment.                        
   All the different clubs that use the
 field make a regular contribution to  
 pay for new grass and for the new     
 toilet block.                         </content>
