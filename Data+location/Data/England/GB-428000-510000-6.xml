		<title>06A Typical child's Saturday</title>
		<content> in Hurworth-on-Tees.  I wake up at    
 about 8am on a Saturday and usually   
 read a book or comic in bed.Then I    
 watch the television in my room.After 
 breakfast of toast, cereal and tea I  
 usually go shopping in town           
 (Darlington) with my Mum at about     
 10.30am.Sometimes my Dad will go into 
 town if he requires something for the 
 car.We stay in town until 1.30pm then 
 we return home for lunch.On Saturday  
 afternoons, Dad and I sometimes watch 
 sport on the television.Alternatively,
 I play with my best friend.If it's a  
 pleasant afternoon, many boys in the  
 neighbourhood meet on the green where 
 we have a game of football/cricket.   
 After tea, I play outside until       
 8.20pm.Then I come in and watch       
 television until 10.30pm when it is   
 bedtime.                              
                                       </content>
