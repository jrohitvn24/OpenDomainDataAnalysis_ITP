		<title>14B.M.X. BIKES - CALNE TRACK</title>
		<content> B.M.X. bikes were first common in     
 1980.They are light bikes with plastic
 wheel rims called "mags" or           
 "ukies".They are not made for riding  
 to work, they are made for fun, for   
 stunts and races.One of the stunts you
 can try is called a "Wheelie", this is
 when you pull the front wheel off the 
 ground and ride on the back one only. 
 An "Endow" is when you lift the back  
 wheel and ride on the front wheel     
 only.When you lift all the wheels off 
 the ground it is called a "Bunny      
 hop".The best B.M.X. track in Calne is
 Bentley Wood.It is 50 metres by 25    
 metres,the ramps are made of mud.     
 There is one small jump, two camel    
 humps and two big jumps. Lots of      
 people use it, nearly always boys aged
 from about 8-9years up to 15 or 16    
 years old.
