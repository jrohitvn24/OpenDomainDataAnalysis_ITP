		<title>20OTTERTON CHURCH (St.Michael)</title>
		<content> There is one place of worship in      
 Otterton, the Parish Church, called   
 St. Michael's. It was so named because
{William the Conqueror}gave the Church 
 and its Priory to the monks of Mont   
 St. Michel, of his home Normandy.     
 The Church was mostly re-built in 1870
 and is large for the size of the      
 village. The tower is much older and  
 is built of red stone.                
 The Vicar in 1985 is the Revd. Bill   
 Turnbull. He was the first Vicar to   
 have two parishes to look after;      
 Colaton Raleigh as well as Otterton.  
 Next to the Church is the village     
 school, which is a Church of England  
 Primary School.                       
 Also next to the Church is an old     
 manor house, re-built by a Mr. Duke   
 from money he got after the closing of
 the monasteries in the 1530s.
