		<content> Eight members of Kirby and Broughton  
 Women's Institute compiled the        
 information about this area with the  
 help of their husbands and friends.   
 The National Federation of Women's    
 Institutes is the largest women's     
 organisation in the country. None of  
 us actually lives in the area,        
 although one member lives in a similar
 area which overlooks the Eastern edge 
 of this one. Between us we are, or    
 have been, housewives, teachers, Tax  
 Inspectors and Local Government       
 employees. Our husbands include       
 foresters, farmers, Bank Managers,    
 architects, teachers and engineers.   
 We all have access to at least one    
 car, which is almost a necessity in a 
 rural area. There is a telephone in   
 each of our homes.
