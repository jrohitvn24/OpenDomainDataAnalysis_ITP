		<title>11Finningley village - history</title>
		<content>{Finningley}village was mentioned in   
 the Domesday Book,as {'Feniglei' }    
 which means 'clearing of fen          
 dwellers'.It is about 5 miles away    
 from Bawtry.The land around it is only
 7 metres above sea level.             
   The {church}is about 900 years old, 
 and gets its name from {St.Oswald}who 
 was king of Northumbria at that time. 
   It is built of limestone.The Norman 
 door has elaborate,trefoil carvings   
 and is very strong.The roof of the    
 nave is solidly built of oak          
 timbers,with delicate carvings in some
 parts.There are two monuments:the     
 first to Rev.Edmond Harvey,Rector,and 
 the second to Rev.John Harvey,also a  
 Rector.The Harvey family was important
 in the history of the village as they 
 were principal landowners.
