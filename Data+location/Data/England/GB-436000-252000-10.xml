		<title>10FARMERS' JOBS</title>
		<content>                                       
 In our area there are lots of farms.We
 visited some of them.They were the    
 Smiths' Farm,the Taylors' Farm and the
 Griffiths' Farm.The Smiths' and the   
 Taylors' farms are in Northend and the
 Griffiths' Farm is in Knightcote.The  
 Smiths Farm is quite big and it is 700
 years old.On the farm Mr and Mrs Smith
 have to do lots of jobs.These are some
 of them:feeding the animals,spraying  
 the crops,taking the animals to market
 and buying and selling animals.For    
 most farms the farmer has more jobs to
 do in the summer.The Griffiths' farm  
 is hundreds of years old.The different
 thing about the Griffiths' Farm is    
 that Mr. Griffiths owns the farm but  
 someone else works on it.The Taylors' 
 farm house is 330 years old.All the   
 farmers we met were concerned with    
 different types of farming.           </content>
