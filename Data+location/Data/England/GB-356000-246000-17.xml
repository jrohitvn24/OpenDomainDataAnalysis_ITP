		<title>17Trade in the Felton Area</title>
		<content> Several small businesses have         
 developed in this area.  A stock lorry
 for conveying animals is housed at    
 Felton Stone Farm.  There are also two
 catering establishments run from      
 private houses in Felton.  At Burley  
 Gate there are two garages which carry
 out Ministry of Transport tests and   
 general repairs to local cars and     
 machinery.  Two shops at Burley Gate  
 (one attached to the Post Office, the 
 other to a garage) supply any         
 groceries and general household items.
 A herb farm has been established at   
 Ocle Pychard, where locally grown     
 herbs are freeze dried and packaged.  
 They are distibuted to various        
 retailers throughout the country.     
 Milk is delivered from Hereford to the
 door and a baker travels around the   
 area.  A drinks and beer lorry comes  
 once a week.                          </content>
