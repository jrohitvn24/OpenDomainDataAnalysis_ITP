		<title>10WILDLIFE IN BLACKPARK</title>
		<content> Just got back from Black  Park.The    
 first bird we saw was a Mallard       
 duck,it is most common on lakes and   
 reservoirs there was a whole flock    
 of them.As we were walking round the  
 lake we saw a Chaffinch in a dip by   
 the road with it there was a House    
 Sparrow,a Robin and a Dunnock.On the  
 lake we saw a summer visitor the      
 Canada Goose.After we saw those birds 
 we went into the woods on the way we  
 saw a Blue Tit.In the woods Steve said
 to me "Gareth look at this""Big wow"I 
 said"But its a Gold Crest"(the        
 smallast bird in the world).We stood  
 for five minutes close enough to      
 touch.Hope you have enjoyed this      
 report.
