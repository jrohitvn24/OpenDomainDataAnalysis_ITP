		<title>18 THE RECREATION GROUND</title>
		<content> The recreation ground is a very       
 important place in the village.       
 Children can go to the recreation     
 ground and do stunts on bikes instead 
 of playing on the road and causing    
 accidents. There are swings and slides
 at the recreation ground,for young    
 children to play on.There is enough   
 space for a game of football or       
 cricket.On the other side of the      
 recreation ground there are           
 allotments.At the recreation ground   
 there is a big grass roller.The roller
 is so big it needs a tractor to pull  
 it.People of all age groups go to the 
 recreation ground in their spare      
 time.In the football season they have 
 matches every week but in summer they 
 play cricket on a more casual basis.
