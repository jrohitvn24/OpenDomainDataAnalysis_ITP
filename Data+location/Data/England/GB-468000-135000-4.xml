		<title>04CHAWTON HOUSE</title>
		<content> In 1224 the King ordered that two oaks
 from Alice Holt Forest should be      
 delivered to the St. John family      
 towards making a house in their manor.
 For about three hundred years the     
 house was in the St. John name until  
 the Knight family bought the estate.  
 Today the Knights still own the house 
 but much of the estate was divided up 
 and sold in the 1950's. Major Edward  
 Knight, his wife ,Elizabeth, and son  
 Robert live in part of the house. In  
 another part son Jeremy and his family
 live. Other parts have been divided   
 into flats and rented out.
