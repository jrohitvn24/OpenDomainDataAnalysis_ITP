		<title>02THE GEOGRAPHY OF BRUTON AREA</title>
		<content>   The main land use in this area is   
for the majority,dairy farming.Some    
farmers have changed to beef farming   
and the Mill on the Brue activities    
centre,has replaced farming.In the     
area around Castle Cary, vineyards have
replaced the dairy farming.The old     
houses of this area are mainly built   
from Inferior Oolitic Limestone,the    
newer ones are built from Faced        
Breeze-Blocks,the faced surface is made
from Ham-stone or Cotswold-stone.The   
climate is suited for grass,so dairy   
farming is practised.The land relief of
the area is undulating,due to two      
rivers cutting or dissecting a         
Limestone Plateau,which we are living  
over.The rivers are non-existent at the
present.
