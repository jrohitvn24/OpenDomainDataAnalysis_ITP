		<content> We were told by people that there     
 were no pubs,post offices and shops in
 Claxton.The only shop was in a garage.
 There was once a pub called the       
 Farley Inn which was closed 4 years   
 ago  in 1981 because of lack of       
 custom.It had been running there from 
 1900.A new village hall has been built
 ,the old one had been knocked down,the
 bricks built some stables.The new     
 village hall housed a club,with       
 pooltables etc.Most of the land around
 Claxton is owned by Major Allhusen,he 
 employs 5 people from the village,who 
 live in his house.Most of the people  
 in Claxton have to go to work in      
 Norwich.There is a bus service from   
 Loddon to Norwich for their           
 shopping.There will be not much       
 developement in Claxton as there is   
 green belt around the village.
