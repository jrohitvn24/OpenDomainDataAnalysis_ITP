		<content>There is a wide variety of different   
styles of housing in our area. In the  
country areas most of the houses are   
built of local stone. In the village of
Minster Lovell most of the houses built
during the past 20 years have been     
constructed of brick. There are a lot  
of cottages near the farms and some of 
these are tied cottages. In Minster    
Lovell most of the houses are privately
owned although there are a number of   
council houses.
