   The day starts at 8.35 a.m. when a  
 bell goes for the start of tutor      
 time.We all sit down very quickly     
 before Mrs. Crocker comes into the    
 room to register.After registration we
 sit and talk about last night's       
 T.V.When the bell goes we all rush off
 to our next lesson. Today it's French 
 first. We all line up outside the     
 classroom until Mrs. Gosney is ready  
 to take us.She then tells us to come  
 in and sit down. French is pretty     
 boring and we're all glad when the    
 bell goes.                            
   Then it's Humanities with Mr.       
 Bovington. After that we go to        
 Break.English is next,then lunch.     
   After lunch it's  Maths with Mr,    
 Alexander. This is a brilliant lesson.
 When the bell goes we go home. When I 
 get home I go swimming.               </content>
