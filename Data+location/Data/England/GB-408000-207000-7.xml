		<title>07WINSON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In l844 a school was built in the N.E.
 corner of Winson churchyard for the   
 education of children of "the poor    
 inhabitants" of Winson. An area of the
 churchyard was fenced off for a       
 playground. The school consisted of a 
 porch and one large classroom heated  
 by a stove, with a smaller room       
 behind. It continued in use till the  
 1920's when the children were         
 transferred to Bibury and taken there 
 daily by horse and cart. It was then  
 used as a vestry by the vicar of      
 Bibury till the late 1940's when it   
 was disposed of to the Diocese of     
 Gloucester for Â£50, after which it    
 gradually fell into disrepair. In 1984
 it was sold for Â£13000 to the Society 
 of All Saints, Oxford, who restored   
 and modernised it to make it into a   
 comfortable retreat for their members.
