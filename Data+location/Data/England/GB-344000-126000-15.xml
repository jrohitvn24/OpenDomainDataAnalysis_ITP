		<content> Pitney was mentioned in the Domesday  
 Book as a 'Royal Property'.The name   
 used to be spelt 'Puttney Lortie',    
 Putt meaning soft dirt and ney an     
 island.It was rented from the King for
 a shilling a year by the De Lortie    
 family .There is a local story that if
 anyone hears you live in Pitney they  
 will say to you "how is the harbour ?"
 One end of the village still floods   
 after long periods of severe rain!    
                                       
                                       
 Farmers used to keep large flocks of  
 sheep as well as cows.The sheep_wash  
 can still be seen in the stream that  
 runs through the village.             
                                       
                                       
 There were several cider presses in   
 the village,all the farmers had enough
 cider to last them through the year.  </content>
