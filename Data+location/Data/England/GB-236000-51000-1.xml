		<title>01An area of Whitsand Bay</title>
		<content> This area offers outstanding coastal  
 views accross Whitsand Bay towards    
 Rame Head to the east and Looe to the 
 west.  From the cliffs at Tregantle on
 a clear day you can see the Eddystone 
 Lighthouse 12 miles out to sea.  The  
 beaches of Whitsand Bay attract many  
 people during the summer season not   
 just for the sandy beaches but for    
 surfing (one of the few spots on the  
 south coast), sea fishing and         
 scuba-diving. Recently hang-gliders   
 have been taking full advantage of the
 steep cliffs along the bay. The B3247 
 road divides the rough cliff top land 
 and golf course south of the road from
 the farm land to the north. Trethill  
 Cliffs and Tregantle Cliff are owned  
 by the National Trust. A narrow road  
 which runs along the cliff's edge     
 between Freathy and Tregantle allow   
 the traveller a stunning seascape.    </content>
