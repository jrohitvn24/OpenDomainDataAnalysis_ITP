		<content> During the Second World War things    
 began to change in Chapel             
 Allerton.Food, clothing and sweets    
 were rationed and little could be     
 bought without coupons and money.Young
 men went off to war and women began to
 work on the farms.The houses had      
 blackout curtains to keep out the     
 light and everyone had a gas mask.    
 About fifty children came from the    
 cities to Chapel Allerton as evacuees.
 They joined the 20 children at the    
 village school. After the war many    
 young people went to live and work in 
 the cities. Small farms were joined   
 together and tractors and machinery   
 were bought to help. Many people had  
 cars and lived in Chapel Allerton     
 while working in nearby towns and     
 cities. The local school closed and   
 the bus service to Weston was stopped.
 Now the only way to travel is by car. </content>
