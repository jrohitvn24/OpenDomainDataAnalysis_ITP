		<title>01THE SEA AT ROBIN HOODS BAY</title>
		<content> Nearly the entire block is in the sea 
 at Robin Hoods Bay and only a few     
 square metres of land are included in 
 the north west corner. This is 150 ft 
 high cliff with rough grass atop.     
 Below is a fairly extensive rocky     
 intertidal area, sometimes visited by 
 students and tourists. The Cleveland  
 Way footpath passes nearby to the     
 west. Hilly arable and mainly         
 grassland are found inland from the   
 block and 1km away is Robin Hoods Bay 
 village, a popular area for tourists. 
 The land is owned by the National     
 Trust and also being in a National    
 Park (and heritage coast) the area is 
 valued for its scenery and unspoilt   
 nature.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
