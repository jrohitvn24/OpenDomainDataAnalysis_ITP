		<title>13WEST STREET 'ENTERTAINMENT'</title>
		<content> West Street is one of the most visited
 streets in Brighton because it houses 
 the main night-clubs, cinemas, and    
 amusement arcades. At present there   
 are six amusement arcades housing over
 2,000 video and fruit machines on one 
 side of the street! There are two main
 discotheques- The 'Pink Coconut' used 
 to be known as 'Sherry's Ballroom'    
 during the 1920's (Opened 1924) and   
 lasted through tothe late l9707s      
 altering its image with the changing  
 tastes of music and the 'Top Rank'    
 which was formerly a swimming poolin  
 the 1930's called S.S.Brighton and    
 later became a roller and ice skating 
 rink.
