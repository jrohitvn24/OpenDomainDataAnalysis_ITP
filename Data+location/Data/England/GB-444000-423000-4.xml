		<content> Most old people didn't feel lonely    
 because they had visitors,mainly relat
 ives,but some had comments like,I only
 feel lonely when I think of friends   
 who've passed away.They sounded very  
 sad when they told us their pets had  
 died.Most people enjoy and like seeing
 children and said they didn't cause   
 many problems.Most people spend their 
 day cleaning and shopping. Two men    
 make short wave broadcasts and listen 
 to other countries.One makes working  
 models of trams another plays the     
 guitar.Knitting,jigsaws,bowls and     
 walking are very popular hobbies.One  
 person made us feel sad because all   
 she does is sit in her chair all day  
 and read books with big print.She     
 finds it hard to hear what you say.11 
 people went out on some occasion &amp; 1  
 person went out every day.Most people 
 we questioned never went out at all.  </content>
