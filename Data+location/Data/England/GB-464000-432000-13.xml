		<title>13Employment in Cliffe</title>
		<content>    We asked the children in Cliffe    
 school where their mothers and fathers
 worked. Two fathers were{unemployed,  
 36 fathers had jobs, and 19 mothers   
 had jobs as well.                     
    There were 37 different jobs on the
 list. 13 people worked in the village,
 5 on market gardens and 4 on farms.   
 Three people each worked at power     
 stations, banks, coal mines, British  
 Oil and Cake Mills in Selby, or as    
 lorry drivers.                        
    There were 29 jobs that only one   
 person worked at, with some uncommon  
 ones like silversmith, bobbin lace    
 equipment supplier, carpet repairer   
 and Australian Tourist Commission.    
    Not many adults in Cliffe are      
 unemployed, but it is harder for      
 teenagers to get work.
