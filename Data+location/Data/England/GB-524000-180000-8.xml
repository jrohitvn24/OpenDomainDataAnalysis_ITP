		<content>Edgeware Road i.e. Watling Street runs 
diagonally across this block and ends  
at Marble Arch,a monument with a       
queerly displaced air,within shouting  
distance of Speakers Corner.           
To the south is Bayswater Road,and to  
the south again is the sand surfaced   
Ring,once so fashionable and still used
by riders exercising their horses.     
Between Oxford St. and Marylebone Rd.  
has always been, and remains,a sought  
after residential area.                
North of the Marylebone Rd. stands     
Marylebone Station, an attractive,     
small scale mainline station.The       
station is currently under threat of   
closure.                               
The east of the block is bordered by   
Baker St.,with its many associations,  
and to the west the Westway soars up   
in a rising curve from the Marylebone  
Road.                                  </content>
