     My home was built in{1886}and is a
{semi-detached}house.My home is part of
 the{Tetcott Housing Estate}.Tetcott is
 a very small village set in the       
{countryside},and is three miles away  
 from the nearest school which is      
{Clawton.C.P.school. }The village of   
 Tetcott has got one{post office}and   
{General Stores}and no other shops.    
     The house that I live in is rented
 by{'The Hunt'}.My father is the       
 huntsman and kennel Huntsman of the   
{South Tetcott Hunt}.In his job he has 
 to pick up dead animals,he then has to
 bring them back to the kennels to skin
 them and the next day he feeds it to  
 the{hounds.

 years.The{view}from the front upstairs
 room's window is lovely.You can see
