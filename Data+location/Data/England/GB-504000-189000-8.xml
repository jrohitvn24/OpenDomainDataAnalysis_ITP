		<title>08MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> Harefield's manufacturing is centred  
 on the canal at Coppermill Lock.As    
 early as the Seventeenth Century,     
 industry using water power from the   
 Colne located here.This site is now   
 occupied by the Bell works, producing 
 rubber equipment for industrial       
 use.These works form the centre of a  
 small cluster of firms.               
 The factories have suffered during the
 1980's economic recession.The Bell    
 works responded to difficulties by    
 short time working and proposed       
 selling off land for housing.Cape     
 Universal Claddings closed down their 
 Harefield works and Croda Inks went   
 into receivership.They were then taken
 over by Fishburn Inks, who have put   
 some buildings up for sale and        
 threaten redundancies.The more        
 prosperous firms seem to be the small 
 units based on workshops.             </content>
