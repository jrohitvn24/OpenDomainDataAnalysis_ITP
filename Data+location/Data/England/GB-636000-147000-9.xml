		<content> The majority of employed  people in   
 Kingsdown travel daily to work by car.
 Most of these travel less than  50    
 miles per week. Very few people use   
 public transport in Kingsdown because 
 they consider the service to be       
 poor and the fares too high.          
 The Deal bus comes to the Rising sun  
 at 10 past the hr to take people back 
 into Deal.It is 70p each way.A number 
 of people prefer to share a taxi than 
 rely on public transport.             
 Trains _ There are no stations in our 
 area,but the Charing Cross to         
 Ramsgate train passes through our grid
 before stopping at Walmer.
