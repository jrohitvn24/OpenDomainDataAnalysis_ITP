		<content> Saxon/Angles names abound eg Pilling. 
 Preesagh means a heath covered hill,  
 and is of Scandinavian origin.        
 Parrox Hall (03600478) is built on    
 part of the Manor granted by King John
 to Geoffrey the Arbelestrier.It has   
 been in the Elletson family (despite  
 the Civil War) continuously since     
 then! Preesall was part of Stalmine   
 Parish and the Church of St Oswald's  
 was built as a Chapel of Ease         
 (03590485) IN 1898-9.As you will see  
 the discovery of salt provided an     
 impetus to the growth of population in
 Preesall but in Piling the rural      
 nature remains.The area was           
 inaccessible until the opening of the 
 Garstang to Knott-End Railway, so that
 both villages were very self-contained
 and self-sufficient.Anyone who is not 
 born and bred here will always be     
 called "an incomer".                  </content>
