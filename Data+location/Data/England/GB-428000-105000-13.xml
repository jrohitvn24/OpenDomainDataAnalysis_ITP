		<title>13The New Forest</title>
		<content> Our survey revealed that over 70% of  
 the area consisted of forestland.   It
 is part of the New Forest which       
 includes Gritnam Wood, Whitley Wood   
 and Park Ground Inclosure.            
 Much of the land is ancient forest    
 previously used for hunting.          
 Deciduous trees are dominant chiefly  
 oak, beech and birch.   There are some
 small areas afforested with coniferous
 trees and there is also some heathland
 and marshland.   There are 4          
 Inclosures, areas of forest which have
 been fenced off to protect trees from 
 grazing animals such as deer and      
 ponies.                               
 Much forest is managed by The Forestry
 Commission; and The Nature Conservancy
 Council based in Lyndhurst also seeks 
 to preserve the natural habitats of   
 the area in which wildlife and        
 plantlife still thrive.               </content>
