		<title>01BARTON _ UPON _ HUMBER</title>
		<content>   Barton could be described as a      
 handsome old market town,noted today  
 as the place where the A15 becomes    
 airborne over the Humber bridge.      
   The town is full of tree-lined      
 streets and has many red bricked      
 Georgian houses as well as two fine   
 old churches _St.Peters and St.Marys  
   In the South of the town is a fine  
 old Georgian house _ Baysgarth house  
 in which is a small museum.           
   Before the bridge,Barton was once   
 famous for its large claypits from    
 which "Humber Warp" clay was once dug 
 for use in brick and tile making.     
   In the original Domesday book       
 Barton was already a town of some     
 significance in the county and today  
 it is twinned with the town of Feyzin 
 in France.
