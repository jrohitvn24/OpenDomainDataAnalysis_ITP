		<title>16POLLUTION OF LOCAL RIVER,B.H</title>
		<content> The River Roding is the only river    
 running through Buckhurst Hill.       
    The Roding is once again polluted. 
 The first time was by a lorry crashing
 on a bridge on the M11. It spilled    
 several gallons of chemicals into the 
 river.                                
    The Thames Water Authority tried to
 stop the oil going into the River     
 Thames ,as the River Roding leads to  
 the Thames. So the pollution          
 inspectors put absorbent "booms" into 
 the water. But it rained, so the oil  
 got underneath and some flowed into   
 the Thames.                           
     A local said,"We have got a       
 beautiful river and we want to keep it
 like that. It should be full of fish, 
 but all we have is some kind of       
 chemical. The locals ought to look    
 after the river more."
