		<title>03BODIAM STATION</title>
		<content>   There has been a station on this    
 site since{Victorian}times, and the   
 track has been used to transport{hops 
 from Robertsbridge; and{flour}, as    
 well as local people to Tenterden.    
 However, during recent years, the     
 station and its{steam}trains have seen
 little use - though there is hope for 
 the future!                           
   Local enthusiasts have been hard at 
 work{restoring}the station to its     
 former glory with a view to running   
 weekend and Bank Holiday steam trips  
 to Tenterden and back. This would     
 take advantage of the close proximity 
 of the already popular Bodiam Castle  
 as a tourist attraction. The station's
 oldest{engine}, the "Bodiam Shunter", 
 is sited at the station.
