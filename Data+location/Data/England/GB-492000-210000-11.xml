		<content>    The Parish Church in the High      
 Street is a very big church and every 
 Sunday people go there. It is very    
 big inside and it is very tall. My    
 mum and dad got married in it. Little 
 babies can be christened there.       
    The Catholic Church is a bit       
 smaller but a lot of people go        
 there.It is in Langdon  St.           
    There are three Baptist Churches   
 one in New Rd and Akeman St and last  
 of all the High St. The one in New    
 Rd is where I go to Girls Club.       
    There is one Methodist church, it  
 is in Chapel St.It is small and people
 go there to pray every Sunday.
