		<content> The climate produces quite a lot of   
 rain - usually in the form of fairly  
 light showers - with some large-scale 
 storms drifting in from the sea.      
                                       
 There is often a steady wind, made    
 worse by the very flat land and the   
 relatively few large trees or other   
 windbreaks.                           
                                       
 The latest types of tractor, in use by
 the local farms, have enclosed cabs   
 with heaters, and also headlights at  
 both ends, so that field work cam go  
 on in most weathers and even into the 
 night if necessary.                   
                                       
 During dry sunny weather, there tends 
 to be a lot of dust in the air... it  
 is to be hoped that erosion does not  
 spoil the rich soil.
