		<title>12ST.IVES HARBOUR</title>
		<content>  The harbour is great.There's always  
 something happening around it. You can
 have a{swim}, or just sunbathe on the 
{sand}.If you are daring ,or daft , you
 can jump and dive off the pier. If you
 are a 'visitor ' you could take a boat
{trip}or even hire a 'self drive' boat.
  When the 'maroons' go off everyone   
 rushes to watch the{lifeboat}being    
 launched from from its trailer.The    
 Salvation Army{band}doesn't play on   
 the slipway then.                     
  There's always the{Arcade}where all  
 the kids meet.In winter it's about the
 only thing open.Then most of the small
 boats have been laid up and only the  
 keenest{anglers}fish from the pier.The
 few  bigger  boats  bob  up  and  down
 impatiently waiting to go to sea and  
 the old fishermen sit snugly in their 
{lodges}talking of better days.
