		<content> The tourist attraction of North Nibley
 is its closeness to Cotswold towns    
 like Wotton and Dursley , and other   
 important tourist sites like Berkeley 
 Castle and Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust. 
 The accommodation is good, as there   
 are about six Bed and Breakfast (B&amp;B) 
 places.Most of them are old buildings 
 or farmhouses.The average price for   
 one night and breakfast is Â£12.Most of
 them have been doing B&amp;B for six      
 years.The area is excellent for       
 walking and it is also a part of the  
 Cotswold Way.There are lots of open   
 fields and woods nearby to go for     
 walks in.Many people who walk the     
 Cotswold Way stop of at Bed and       
 Breakfast houses.Lots of people come  
 to Nibley because of its scenic beauty
 and peacefulness.There is also the    
 nearby medieval church and pubs eg;The
 Black Horse and the  New Inn.         </content>
