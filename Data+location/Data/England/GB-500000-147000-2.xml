		<content> Many different types of animals and   
 birds were found to be living in this 
 area. Swallows, magpies, swifts,      
 robins, thrushes, blackbirds, rabbits,
 foxes, badgers, hares and deer were   
 there.                                
                                       
 We also took soil samples from        
 different areas on the slope. The soil
 consisted mainly of clay and chalk.   
 Among the many types of flowers and   
 grasses, the most common included     
 foxgloves, dog-roses, brambles and    
 scarlet pimpernels. The trees growing 
 here included birch, fir and rowan.   
                                       
 People use this area to walk their    
 dogs and stop for a break on their    
 journey. Very few people complained   
 about the area and most people        
 believed it should be left untouched.
