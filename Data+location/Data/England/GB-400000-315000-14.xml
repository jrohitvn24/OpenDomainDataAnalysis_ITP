  If you walk along Church Close you   
will find the {Church of St. John the  
Baptist} which was built in 1871.It    
is unusual because it is attached to   
a house. Inside it is quite small      
and very cosy.                         
 There is a weekly service usually     
unaccompanied, although the church has 
a harmonium. At the east end there are 
three stained glass windows showing    
Jesus, Mary and John. There are        
fourteen pews.                         
  Mainly people from Slitting Mill     
village go to the services. There are  
not enough children to have a Sunday   
School. The bell rings every Sunday    
morning and can be heard by the whole  
village.
