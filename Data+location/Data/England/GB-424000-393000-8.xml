		<content> Wigtwizzle Plantation is owned by     
 Sheffield Metropolitan District Estate
 Surveyors Department.It lies to the   
 south of Broomhead Reservoir on gently
 sloping land.The trees were planted   
 about 40 years ago. They are mostly   
 coniferous trees - larch, spruce and  
 scots pine.A forest trail of          
 approximately 3 km.can be followed.   
 The trail takes you through the       
 nursery area and into the mature      
 woodland.In the older part of the     
 plantation it is very dark and spooky 
 and the grass is springy.The edge of  
 the plantation had sycamore,rowan,    
 beech and oak trees.A few plants grew 
 where there was light - bramble,      
 foxglove, bracken, gorse, bluebell,   
 nettle, greater stitchwort, wood      
 sorrel and herb robert.
