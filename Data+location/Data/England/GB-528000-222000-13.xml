		<title>13BENINGTON SCHOOL (4)</title>
		<content>The addition of a large meadow for the 
use of the school at the back of the   
building, provides open space for the  
children to play freely, but the origi-
nal cramped tarmacadam playground can  
still be seen at the front.            
Most of the village children attend    
Benington School, but a few choose to  
attend neighbouring schools such as    
those at Stevenage.                    
The day starts at 9.00 a.m. and finish-
es at 3.30 p.m. In the morning there is
a 15 min. playtime and lunchtime is    
from 12.00 noon to 1.0 p.m.            
The present School Role is 80. Of these
50 are Juniors and 30 are Infants.
