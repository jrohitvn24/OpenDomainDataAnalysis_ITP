		<title>03FARMS AROUND DIDCOT</title>
		<content>Ladygrove is a small-holding of about  
12 acres.  Its Northern boundary is the
parish boundary of Didcot itself.  Mr  
Hiskins is unable to farm anymore since
he hurt his back badly when he was     
lifting milk churns.                   
Mount Ash Farm is owned by Mr Andrews. 
Apart from three peacocks, he has      
cattle, hens and geese.  The farm is   
100 years old.  Keeping animals is more
of a hobby to Mr Andrews, which is just
as well, since he and Mrs Andrews are  
moving away in 1985.  The land is to be
built upon, as part of Didcot's major  
housing extension programme.           
One of the few dairy farms in the area 
is Field Farm.  It has dairy cows, a   
bull, some hens and a few dogs.  When  
the cows are ready to be milked, they  
are washed, but only if they are really
dirty.  After that their udders are    
sprayed just in case of any infection. </content>
