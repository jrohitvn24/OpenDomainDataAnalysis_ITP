		<title>10AN OLD COTTAGE</title>
		<content>{                                      
{Millie Scaife}lives at{5 West Row}it  
 is a cottage that is very old.She has 
 lived in the cottage for 12 years.The 
 house is half brick and half stone.She
 likes living in{Sadberge}because it is
 nice and quiet here and the people are
 nice too.The living room and one      
 bedroom are{200 years}old.The toilet  
 used to be at the bottom of the garden
 but now it is in the house.There are  
 three bedrooms upstairs,the toilet,   
 shower and bathroom are downstairs.   
 there are original{oak beams}on the   
 ceiling of the main room.The whole row
 of houses were built at the same time.
 Millie likes the house becase its not 
 on an estate and has a lovely view of 
 the{church. }It is not on a busy road 
 so it is safe for children when they  
 are playing.
