		<content> People in the Butchershole Bottom     
 picnic area(noon August) all seek     
 fresh air and tranquility,car numbers 
 suggest most live in southern England.
 A young married couple,university     
 graduates from Norfolk,were spending  
 the day walking their dog and looking 
 for fungi in the woodland.A male      
 runner toured the forest that morning.
 Older people were picnicking and      
 exercising dogs.All believe that      
 spending time in the open air in      
 peaceful surroundings improves the    
 quality of their lives.The runner     
 expressed happiness and contentment   
 with his job,marriage and extended    
 family,hoping the same for his        
 children.The graduates wanted the best
 education for their children.All hoped
 for international peace,some believing
 that the threat of using the nuclear  
 bomb will help maintain peace.        </content>
