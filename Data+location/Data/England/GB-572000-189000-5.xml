		<content> This area needs more Adventure parks. 
 And more trees and flowers because    
 lots of them are vandalised. We also  
 need more clubs nearby like Karate and
 Riding Schools. We also need more     
 libraries so there can be a library   
 for adults and a library for children.
                                       
 But I am lucky. I think that I have a 
 good area and we have good neighbours 
 next to our house. It is normally very
 quiet and we have a slide out the     
 front, and a couple of trees and some 
 grass so it's very good.              
                                       
 But some people spoil things like     
 writing all over the slide and walls  
 and places and by leaving litter like 
 paper and empty cans and shopping     
 trolleys. Adults do this as much as   
 older children.
