		<title>10MANOR HOUSE CONT</title>
		<content>   We went into the kitchen.There was a
 large fireplace and stone floor,and a 
 passage leading to a room where the   
 servants worked.                      
   Then we went to the second floor.   
 There were 3 rooms and the floor was  
 very unlevel.We went into the first   
 room and there was a door where you   
 could go on to a balcony. Lizzie      
 opened the door to go on the balcony, 
 but Louise said it was not safe to go 
 on.                                   
   Then we went in the next two rooms. 
 They both had windows and about 3 beds
 in them.Then we went in the garden.   
 There were high walls all around it   
 and there were box hedges and a       
 passage leading to the moat.          
   Then Louise took the key back and we
 went round the back of the walls and  
 we met Louise on the other side.
