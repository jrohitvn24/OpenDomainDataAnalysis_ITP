		<title>02The Middleton Area.</title>
		<content> The area that class 2MW surveyed is   
 mainly made up of pre war 1920's      
 housing.Photo A is a good example of  
 the type of brick built houses that   
 were constructed.Most of the houses   
 are semi-detatched but  there are a   
 few town house.All have a front and   
 rear garden and most are owned by     
 Leeds Council although over the last 5
 years a number of tenants have bought 
 there own home.                       
 There are a number of sites where     
 shops are situated.These shops include
 grocers,newspaper and fish and        
 chips.One new aspect to Middleton     
 shops is that 4 of them have been     
 taken over by new immigrants from the 
 Far East.The only road of note is the 
 new M62 that runs from Manchester to  
 Hull and cuts across the bottom of our
 area.The moterway cannot be seen or   
 heard from the majority of the area.  </content>
