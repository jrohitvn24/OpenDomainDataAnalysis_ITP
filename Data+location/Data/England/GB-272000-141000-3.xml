		<content>     In 1970, Somerset County Council  
 bought nearly 2000 acres of Exmoor, as
 their contribution towards European   
 Conservation Year. The purchase       
 included two farms, Driver and        
 Pinkery.                              
 It also included a unique area of wild
 moorland known as the Chains. The     
 County Council were keen to improve   
 the amemites for the public on Exmoor 
 by providing public access to this    
 remote area and also hope to ensure   
 the conservation of this unique       
 area.                                 
     Driver farm has been let to a     
 tenant to be formed on traditional    
 Exmoor lines. Pinkery Farm was given  
 to Somerset Education Committee to be 
 used as an Exploration Centre by the  
 children of Somerset.
