		<content>   In Medway the people are friendly.In
summer 1985 the Queen came to          
Rochester.There were lots of schools   
there.  We saw the Queen's husband, the
Duke of Edinburgh, and he waved at us. 
Some other schools came to our school  
to make lanterns and banners and we got
on quite well.When we got to the Corn  
Exchange, Rochester, it was very       
crowded and noisy.  The Chinese new    
year was to celebrate the year of the  
ox.  The lion was very big and the     
eyes and mouth could move.             
  When you go down town there are lots 
of people wearing weird clothes.  There
are mods, skinheads, punks and casuals.
They all stand in big groups in the    
High Street and some do Break Dancing.
