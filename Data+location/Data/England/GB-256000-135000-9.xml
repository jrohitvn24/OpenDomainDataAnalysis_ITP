		<content> Most of the largest bedrooms are 15   
 metres square(approx). The average    
 kitchen size is 14 metres square      
 (approx) and the average sitting room 
 is 25 metres square (approx). Nearly  
 all houses have mains electricity and 
 mains water but one or two do have    
 their own spring water as well.A lot  
 of changes have been made to quite a  
 lot of the properties since they were 
 built such as new porches and other   
 extensions.                           
   All houses uses electricity for     
 lighting but heating varies from oil  
 fires to night storage heaters.       
   Most houses are up to date with     
 modern equipment such as freezers,    
 colour televisions, telephones        
 , radio, washing machines and record  
 players.Some people are just getting  
 the new machines like computers and   
 microwaves.                           </content>
