		<title>18THE GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content>   Ulverston's golf course takes up a  
 large part of our survey area. It is  
 an 18 hole course with a 9 hole       
 putting green, a driving net with     
 chipping area, and a practice green.  
   You need 6 lessons from the Pro.    
 Mick Smith before you are allowed on  
 the course. There is an 18 month      
 waiting list and following that you   
 are called to a meeting when you are  
 told all about the rules. After that  
 you get a little sticker saying       
 "Member 1985" and when you have       
 completed the 6 lessons and the Pro.  
 thinks you are good enough, he gives  
 you a disc with "Ulverston Golf Club" 
 written on it. You stick the sticker  
 onto the disc, tie the disc to your   
 bag and then you are a full member of 
 the golf club.
