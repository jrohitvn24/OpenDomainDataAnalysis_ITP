		<title>16ROADS AROUND SOUTH ROCHDALE</title>
		<content>                                       
      The main roads in this area are  
 the road from Rochdale to Manchester  
 and the road from Rochdale to Oldham. 
      Crossing our area is the M62     
 motorway which goes from Liverpool on 
 the west coast to Hull on the east    
 coast.                                
      These roads carry a great deal of
 traffic nowadays but one hundred years
 ago the motorway did not exist and the
 other main roads were narrow, rough   
 and stony.                            
      In 1800 a postboy was roobed     
 whilst delivering mail on the road at 
 Castleton. A man was caught for       
 highway robbery and sentanced to      
 death.                                
      The main roads led to a lot of   
 industrial development in the area,   
 which continues today because of the  
 nearby motorway.                      </content>
