		<title>14A DAY IN BEMPTON FOR JAMES</title>
		<content>      A typical Thursday for me would  
 be to get up at about 7.45 a.m., go   
 downstairs for my breakfast of cereal 
 and coffee, get washed and clean my   
 teeth, then get dressed. Dad takes Zoe
 and I to school in the car. We put the
 chairs down from the desks and give   
 out the registers. After assembly we  
 have maths then English, after play it
 is T.V. then grammar. I then have a   
 packed lunch. In the afternoon we do  
 work connected with the T.V. programme
 and then we have games. At 3.30 p.m.  
 Zoe and I walk home, I get changed and
 then play on my computer until tea    
 time. After tea I learn my spellings  
 ready for the test on Friday morning  
 then Zoe and I go to Church for choir 
 practice. We come home and Mum or Dad 
 tests us on our spellings. Then I     
 watch T.V. until bed time, about      
 9 p.m.                                </content>
