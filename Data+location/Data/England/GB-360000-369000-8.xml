		<content> The meat has to be pressed into a     
 uniform shape because the supermarkets
 will only accept a certain shape for  
 the different meats that people who go
 to the shops want to buy.  The meat   
 has to be carved very accurately      
 because there are many different cuts 
 of meat. If the meat was cut in a     
 haphazard manner the different sorts  
 of meat would be mixed, therefore     
 altering the value of the meat.       
 The meat is packaged in plastic bags  
 that have all the air sucked out.     
 This is done on a machine and is      
 called vacuum packing.  This kills    
 some of the bacteria in the meat.  The
 rest is killed by keeping the meat    
 cool.  The workers wear white coats   
 and hair-nets for hygiene reasons.    
 The meat is then sold to supermarkets 
 all over the country but they do not  
 have an export licence.               </content>
