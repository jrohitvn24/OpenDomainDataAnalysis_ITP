		<title>14The school bus driver.</title>
		<content> Every day  after each journey Henry   
 cleans his bus.He takes pupils to     
 school.He takes people shopping,and   
 people to work.The colours on the bus 
 are white,pink and maroon.His first   
 disaster was when he was coming       
 through Little Somerford and he       
 skidded on the road and somebody      
 stopped in the middle of the road with
 a horse box on the back of a land     
 rover.The whole of one side panel was 
 torn from the bus.Fortunately no one  
 was injured. Henry has been a bus     
 driver for 3 years,before that he     
 worked as a cowman.The bus runs on    
 diesel.Everything is now calibrated in
 litres and kilomiters. His bus does   
 about 3 kilometres to 1 litre of      
 diesel.Henry enjoys his work.Bus      
 driving is more comfortable than      
 working out in all weathers,but he    
 says cows were lovely animals to work.</content>
