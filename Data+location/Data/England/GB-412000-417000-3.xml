		<title>03HUDDFIELD TOWN FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> The ground is 77 years old and has    
 gone through good and bad times.      
 Hudersfield were champions of the 1st 
 division, now they are in the second  
 division.                             
 There is seating for 5,8OO people.    
 The largest crowd was 67,OOO but new  
 safety rules mean only 31,OOO can     
 attend now - they don't.  Huddersfield
 gets about 25O,OOO spectators a year. 
 The pitch is 117 yards long and 77    
 yards wide, the grass is cut 3 times a
 week - the groundsman walks 6 miles   
 every week just cutting the grass.    
 There are 3 groundsmen and 6 cleaners 
 to keep the stadium clean and working.
 Sometimes, not often, the ground is   
 used for Pop concerts,but no one is   
 allowed on the turf.
