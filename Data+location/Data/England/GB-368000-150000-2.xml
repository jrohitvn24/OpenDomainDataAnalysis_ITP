		<title>02FARMING SOMERSET MENDIPS</title>
		<content> There are 14 farms centred on this    
 area, about half belong to Ammerdown  
 Estate. These have striven for greater
 efficiency over the last 20 years;    
 some have been amalgamated and their  
 boundaries extended into other areas. 
 They are partly co-operative, sharing 
 machinery and grain drying facilities.
 The privately owned farms are smaller,
 50 - 200 acres, some having been in   
 the same family for many generations. 
 With relatively high rainfall,        
 dairying is still of major importance.
 Although some have abandoned it, many 
 of the larger farms have increased    
 their herds of friesans. Some keep    
 beef cattle and there is a large      
 privately owned pig farm at Newbury.  
 Two small flocks of Jacobs sheep      
 reflect interest in rare breeds.
