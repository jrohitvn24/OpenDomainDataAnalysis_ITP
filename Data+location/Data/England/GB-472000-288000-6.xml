		<title>06THE OLD BAKE HOUSE</title>
		<content> THE OLD BAKE HOUSE WAS BUILT ABOUT 400
 YEARS AGO(SIXTEENth OR SEVENTEENth    
 CENTURY).THEY HAD NO ELECTRICITY IN   
 THOSE DAYS SO THEY HAD A BIG FIRE.    
 THE HOUSE WHICH THE COOK WOULD LIVE IN
 HAS GOT A THATCHED ROOF.THE HOUSE HAS 
 ALSO GOT BIG BRICKS.THE REASON WHY IT 
 HAS BIG BRICKS IS BECAUSE THE CORNERS 
 NEED MORE SUPPORT.THE COOKS HOUSE IS  
 NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY OTHER ROOF    
 THAN A THATCHED ONE.ONE SIDE OF THE   
 COOKS HOUSE HAS JUST BEEN RETHATCHED  
 AND IT COST JUST UNDER Â£2,000.THE OLD 
 BAKE HOUSE USED TO HAVE ONE BIG       
 OVEN,WHERE ALL THE MOTHERS AND FAMILYS
 USED TO TAKE THEIR MEALS TO BE        
 COOKED.THEN THEY WOULD COME AND FETCH 
 THEIR MEALS LATER.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
