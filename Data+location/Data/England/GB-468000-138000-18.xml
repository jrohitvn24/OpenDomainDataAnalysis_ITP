		<content>    At Harvest Festival in September,  
 we all bring food to school.We invite 
 some old people to visit us,we sing to
 them, do some dances and give them tea
 and cakes.Later we take flowers and   
 parcels of food to them.              
    On Hallowe'en my friends and I     
 dress up as witches and ghosts and go 
 to the houses of people we know. We   
 say "Trick or Treat?"and if they say  
 "Treat"they have to give us sweets.If 
 they say "Trick"we play a small trick 
 on them.                              
    On the 5th of November we celebrate
 Bonfire Night.We have a big bonfire   
 and fireworks and then jacket potatoes
 and soup.                             
    When Prince Charles married Lady   
 Diana,we had a street party with food,
 competitions and dancing.
