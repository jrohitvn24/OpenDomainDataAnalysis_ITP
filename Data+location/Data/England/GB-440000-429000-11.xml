		<title>11Cubs and Scouts</title>
		<content> The group sports for cubs and scouts  
 was held at Kippax Common. There were 
 three packs there. Powell which I was 
 in Baden and Apollo, the scout troups 
 were Gillwell troup and Scout troup.  
 A lot of people came to sirport them  
 we had lots of races. Powell won.     
 Baden came second and Apollo came     
 last. The cubs do alot more events    
 like-Swimming Galas, Sports Days,     
 Quizes, Football so all cubs have a   
 good time.
