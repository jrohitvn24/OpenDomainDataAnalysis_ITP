		<content> I enjoy waking up to singing birds.The
 best thing about the village is that  
 it is quiet.It is good for biking and 
 walking and lots of wildlife.I like to
 feel the country air.The area is nice 
 and peaceful and you get lovely views,
 though in the summer there are too    
 many nettles along the footpaths.     
 l like the friendly people in my      
 village.I like the way the people     
 ask me if I want to play with them.   
 There is not much playing area, I     
 would like a playground with swings   
 and slides.                           
 Although there are not many, I think  
 the social activities in this area    
 are fun for all ages.                 
 Most of the adults like working in    
 their gardens in their spare time.
