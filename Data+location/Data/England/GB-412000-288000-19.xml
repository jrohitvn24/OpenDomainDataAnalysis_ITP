		<content>The participation of families in       
organised clubs is not very common in  
this area despite the facilities which 
are available. Shard End Community     
Centre has many different types of     
clubs which are held each day.Many of  
these clubs are for the elderly in the 
area.People from other districts use   
the Centre besides the local           
inhabitants.From the results of a      
survey carried out in four schools it  
would seem that many families do not   
belong to any clubs at all.Of the clubs
which adult members belonged to Social 
Clubs were the most popular followed by
the Community Centre ,Self Defence     
Clubs and Sports Clubs.                
     The most popular clubs attended by
the young of the area in order of      
preference were :-1.Youth Clubs,2.Cubs,
Brownies,Sea Cadets etc., 3.Dancing    
Clubs ,4.Football.        ,            </content>
