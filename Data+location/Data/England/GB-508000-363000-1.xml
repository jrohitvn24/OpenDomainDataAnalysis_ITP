		<title>01Fenlands beyond Dunston</title>
		<content> The fens are of flat, rich soil which 
 is heavily cultivated. The main crops 
 are potatoes sugar beet, and grain.   
 The land is drained into dykes and    
 delphs which feed into the River      
 Witham. Some livestock, mainly sheep, 
 are kept on the banks of Nocton Delph.
 The land is very sparcely populated,  
 the number of homes is only in single 
 figures.  As  most people prefer to   
 live in nearby villages. The Section  
 nearest to Dunston village is some    
 woodland known as Nocton Wood., The   
 mature trees are harvested and then   
 the section is replanted.             
 Although a very flat landscape is has 
 its own particular beauty. Varying    
 greatly with the seasons with a good  
 variety of wildlife, including grouse 
 and pheasants.
