		<title>16CONSERVATION IN TARRANT</title>
		<content> Our block which is part of the Tarrant
 Valley is an area of great beauty as  
 is most of Dorset.To make sure it is  
 not spoilt much of it has been made   
 into Conservation areas.Some say the  
 nearby town of Blandford Forum built  
 in Georgian times has been spoilt by  
 too many new houses,factories and a   
 by-pass road so it is important that  
 the villages of Tarrant Hinton,       
 Launceston and Monkton are not        
 altered too much. Hardly any new      
 buildings are allowed and if you do   
 build one it must be like the ones    
 already there.Some people we talked to
 wanted to add parts to their cottages 
 or build garages but they were not    
 allowed to. I hope the villages will  
 look as pretty as they do now in 500  
 years time.
