		<content> The overall impression of this part of
 Cornwall is one of lush, green fields 
 and woods. The tidal creek of         
 Restronguet runs through the area and 
 further away to the east joins the    
 River Fal. Running alongside part of  
 the creek lies the main A39 road which
 carries traffic from Truro to Falmouth
 and Lizard area. This traffic becomes 
 very dense in the summer as it is a   
 main holiday route. The branch railway
 line from Truro to falmouth runs north
 to south in the west of the area. In  
 the north-east corner there is a      
 private estate called Carclew which   
 covers about 1.5 sq km. The whole of  
 the area is sparcely populated. There 
 are many farms; most are dairy farms  
 with a little arable farming. Much of 
 the land is covered with deciduous    
 woods.                                
                                       </content>
