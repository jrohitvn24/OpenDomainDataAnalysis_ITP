		<title>11Preservation in Fairford</title>
		<content> Most of our Domesday area is{rural}and
 only includes the SW of Fairford,which
 is in a conservation region. Any new  
 buildings must fit in with the old and
 are made of Cotswold or reconstituted 
 stone.Some of the older buildings can 
 still be seen.                        
 On the main road,near the Market      
 Square,stands the{White Hart Inn.}It  
 was formerly a row of cottages and may
 have housed the church masons.It      
 opened in 1750.Near the Inn is the    
 Hyperion Hotel which used to be the   
 Vicarage.On the corner of the         
 crossroads stands Coln House School,  
 which used to be a private assylum.   
 Northville House opened as a Dames    
 SChool in 1837.It is now a private    
 house.The garage near the town bridge 
 used to be a row of cottages.Burdocks 
 House is the site of the old pest     
 house or isolation hospital.          </content>
