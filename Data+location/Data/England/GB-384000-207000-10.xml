		<title>10Winter 81/82 at Edge</title>
		<content> The winter of 1981/82 was one of the  
 worst winters experianced in the      
 Stroud area.In some areas the snow was
 as much as 6 or 7 feet deep and we    
 heard a story about a man who lives on
 the main road below Whiteshill school 
 having to dig a tunnel through the    
 snow in order to get out of his front 
 door.                                 
 An article in the local paper said "A 
 resourceful resident in Edge who had  
 been snowed in for 10 days in January 
 has bought a Â£980 snowblower ready for
 the next arctic onslaught".           
 Teachers at our school said it was    
 awful getting there and the police    
 were turning people back.One man said 
 he remembered the trees being covered 
 with ice which didn't melt for weeks. 
 Other hazards included freezing fog.
