		<title>09Shopping in N.St Ives</title>
		<content> Our area of North ST.IVES consists of 
 housing estates and fields,but there  
 are a few shops such as the Rainbow   
 which is a large supermarket.This is  
 designed to attract customers from in 
 and outside ST.IVES.The shop needs to 
 attract people from outside ST.IVES   
 as there aren't sufficient customers  
 on our estate to support such a large 
 shop.                                 
   There are three other main shops in 
 the Rainbow developement.They are a   
 chemist,the newsagents,the Burleigh   
 Bite and the car parts shop,but these 
 are all smaller than the Rainbow.     
 People use these shops when they come 
 to the Rainbow.If the Rainbow wasn't  
 there then the small shops wouldn't   
 have as many customers.               
  One can buy every day goods at these 
 shops but for clothes and furniture   
 one has to travel to the town centre. </content>
