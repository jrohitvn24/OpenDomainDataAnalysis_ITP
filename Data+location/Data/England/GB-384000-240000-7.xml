		<title>07Churches in Upton on Severn</title>
		<content> There are three denominations in      
 Upton on Severn, by 1820 the old      
 church near the river was in          
 disarepair, plans were drawn up for a 
 church on the same site but decided   
 against. Mr. Martin of Ham Court gave 
 the site of the present{Anglican      
{church}built in 1879. Today the old   
 church is restored and contains the   
 tourist office.                       
 St.Josephs{catholic church}was built  
 in 1849 and had a resident priest     
 until the present time.It is now      
 served from Hanley Swan. The{Baptist  
{church}                               
 may have started in a house in        
 Dunns Lane,later the  community built 
 the present church in Old Street. In  
 1891 a new chapel in New Street only  
 lasted 20 years and is now a garage.
