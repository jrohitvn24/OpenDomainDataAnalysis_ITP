		<content> In the area there is a mixture of old 
 and new houses. Most of the old ones  
 are built out of stone with tiled     
 roof. Some new bungalows are now being
 built. To make way for these,an old   
 brick shed near the school was pulled 
 down. Most ofthem are of different    
 design. The{Rectory}was built of stone
 in 1860 and trees are growing tall    
 around it. Another stone house built  
 in 1740 is in use still.              
 In 1830 {Waddingham Old School }was   
 built.It is 155 years old.The school  
 has not been used since 1983 because  
 snow was blown under the tiled roof   
 and the suspended ceiling fell in.    
{Rusling's Shop}is about 90 years      
 old.It is built of stone but has      
 fairly modern windows.Most of the     
 schoolchildren buy their sweets there.
