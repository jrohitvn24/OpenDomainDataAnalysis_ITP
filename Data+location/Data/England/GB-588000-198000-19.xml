		<content> Latchingdon has 4 football teams,     
 under 9's,under 11's, under 12's, and 
 the senior team.Ross and I play for   
 the under 11's.Our positions are Ross 
 is centre foward and I am right wing. 
 We train at Latchingdon playing field 
 every Wednesday.We have a sponsor     
 called Maldon Fencing, they buy us    
 tracksuits and new kits when we need  
 them and they get their name on our   
 shirts. The team is called Latchingdon
 Juniors. Each year we get trophies.   
 The trophies we get are Best Player,  
 Players Player, Best Improved,        
 Sportsman of the Year and the Brett   
 Lakkides Shield. The shield is for    
 Brett Lakkides who used to play in    
 goal for us but in 1985 he died during
 a heart operation so we have a shield 
 to commemorate him.Often we have      
 discos and jumble sales to raise funds
 for the club.                         </content>
