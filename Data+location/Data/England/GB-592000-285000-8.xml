		<content> Started 15 years ago, to provide the  
 young people in the village with a    
 worthwhile and helpful outlet for     
 their energies, St. John's Ambulance  
 Cadets now cater for 30 children      
 (7-16) and 5 adults.                  
                                       
 In any one year, there are 3 training 
 programmes, covering a wide range of  
 aspects, from home nursing to nature  
 studies.  Also, there are annual      
 County camps and this year, members   
 from this division attended.  In      
 competitions, Bridgham has gained a   
 reputation envied by many, for we do  
 very well at both County and Open     
 levels.  However, Cadets also serve in
 wider areas  _ e.g. litter collecting 
 and carol singing in the village and  
 undertaking duties at various local   
 functions, such as charity fetes.
