		<title>20Our Survey of Tavistock</title>
		<content>    We thought the Domesday project was
 very interesting.We found out lots of 
 things by going out on{field trips,}  
 looking in books,{interviewing people,
 looking at places and reading maps.   
    There are about 150 children in the
 school aged between 7 and 11, and all 
 6 classes took part.                  
{ Each class wrote 3 pages and studied 
{ a 2 kilometre area}for land cover and
 amenities. Our class, Pewtor Jones 4th
 year, was divided into groups of about
 6, to study Whitchurch, Sport and     
 Future plans.                         
    By finding out about Tavistock we  
 have learnt all about its{history}and 
 origins.We have also found out about  
{ Tavistock Today}by taking            
 photographs,etc.                      
    We think this information will     
 be useful to future generations who   
 will read the 1986 Domesday Project.  </content>
