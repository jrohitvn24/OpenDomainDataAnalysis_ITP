		<content>   Whilst the majority of housing in   
 Newton is post-war there is           
 considerable historic and scenic      
 interest in West Kirby and Caldy.     
   St.Bridgets Parish Church in West   
 Kirby has featured as a place of      
 Christian worship for nearly one      
 thousand years and West Kirby is one  
 of the oldest settlements on the      
 Wirral.                               
   The old village of West Kirby,not   
 far from the church is also of        
 interest and in recent years it has   
 undergone restoration and also        
 includes the Ring O Bells,an          
 eighteenth century coaching inn.      
   The older part of Caldy village is  
 also built of red sandstone and is one
 of the most picturesque parts of the  
 area.Although there has been a lot of 
 building the character of the village 
 has been maintained.                  </content>
