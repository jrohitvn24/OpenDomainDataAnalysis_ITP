  The first record of the common dates 
  back to the early 1600s, when it     
  belonged to{Hazelbury Manor Estate.  
  From this time the local people have 
  had the right to graze their animals 
  here and to collect fire wood.The    
  land was bought in 1978 by the{Parish
{ Council}who manage it on behalf of   
  the people of{Box.}The common is     
  mainly  used for recreation and      
  nature study.Young beech trees are   
  protected by rabbit guards.They will 
  take many years to reach the size of 
  mature trees, some of which are dying
  and will have to be felled.Wild      
  orchids are also prevalent.
