		<title>10A KNOTTING FARMER (2)</title>
		<content>                                       
      The farms are worked by four men 
 using a variety of machines amongst   
 them Ford tractors and Class combines.
 A Dutch barn and a dry barn are used  
 to store corn.  The most hectic time  
 of the year is the last week of July, 
 when everyone works from six a.m.     
 until late at night harvesting 30 to  
 40 fields.                            
                                       
     The farm has been in the family   
 for a few generations, and Mr. Parrish
 went into the business with his father
 when he was twenty.  There used to be 
 more livestock but gradually the      
 family moved towards almost total     
 arable farming.  Now however Mr.      
 Parrish is concerned to keep a        
 reasonable sized flock of mutton sheep
 and is very interested in developing  
 his Highland cattle herd for beef.    </content>
