		<content>{John Hughes}was a gipsy. His  grave is
 in the graveyard of St. John the      
 Baptist Church in Itchen Abbas. John  
 Hughes died on March 19th 1825 aged 26
 years. That was 160 years ago.{He was 
{the last man in England to be hung for
{horse stealing.}The owner of the      
 stolen horse was the Rev Robert       
 Wright, who  arranged  for the body to
 be buried in the graveyard. He was    
 obviously a forgiving man. Bodies of  
 criminals were usualy sent to a       
 hospital for dissection.Doctors       
 wanted corpses to find out about the  
 human body.{He was hanged in          
{Winchester}and walked to the gallows  
 wearing his best clothes with silver  
 crowns for buttons.                   
{On the gravestone is written "He is a 
{faithful friend,a father dear an      
{unfortunate husband lieth here".}
