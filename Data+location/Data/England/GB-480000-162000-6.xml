{1859.}The first{Duke of Wellington}   
 died on the 14th September,1852, and {
{Queen Victoria }planned to set up a   
 school to educate the orphans of army 
 officers. The money was raised by     
 public subscription and the site was  
 chosen as there was an abundance of   
 land, building materials, the adjacent
 railway and a good water supply.      
    {Wellington College}opened its     
 doors to 76 pupils on the{20th January
 and 9 days later{Queen Victoria}opened
 it officially. The commemoration      
 plaque says{"On the 29th January our  
{visitor Her Majesty Queen Victoria    
{opened the College as the national    
{monument to the Great Duke of         
{Wellington".}The College has several  
 articles once owned by the Duke and   
 they are now in a showcase.
