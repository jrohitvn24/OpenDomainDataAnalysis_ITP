		<title>05ST.MARGARET'S BAY TRUST</title>
		<content>   The St.Margaret's Bay Trust was     
 founded in 1970 by Mr.Cleary. He      
 bought South Sands House and turned it
 into a museum and beautiful garden.   
 Then people started to join the trust.
 The trust has bought the St.Margaret's
 house which is now a youth club,the   
 old school which has a joined on      
 library. Cliff House,in the village,  
 was bought and converted into flats.  
 The Glebe land,which is next to the   
 Church and village hall was bought    
 along with the Pines Gardens.         
                                       
   The Trustees don't ask for funds but
 they wouldn't refuse an appropriate   
 gift.They hope that their renovations 
 help all who live in or visit         
 St.Margaret's Bay.
