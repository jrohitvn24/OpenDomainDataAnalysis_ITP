 sometimes he uses his car. His        
 shifts are eight hours long but his   
 office is open all the time. He is    
 told by either Selsey or Chichester   
 Police Station what he has to do.His  
 area covers  Sidlesham, Hunston,      
  North and South Mundham, Lagness     
 and Pagham Harbour.
