		<title>10Rag Week, Lancaster</title>
		<content> Rag Week is held at Lancaster         
 Univeristy every year in November. Its
 main purpose is to raise money for    
 charity and for students and residents
 to have fun. Events include sponsored 
 walks and wheelchair races from       
 Morecambe to Lancaster; hit squads who
 jump off Morcambe Pier, 3 legged and  
 wheelbarrow races, pub crawlsand      
 record breaking attempts. The week    
 ends with a procession of colourful   
 floats through the streets of         
 Lancaster, with students persuading   
 the local residents to part with their
 money. The money raised, about Â£5000 a
 year, goes to at least 15 different   
 chariuties in the local area. A       
 committee of students plan out the    
 events each year, organise a rag ball 
 and sell T shirts and posters.
