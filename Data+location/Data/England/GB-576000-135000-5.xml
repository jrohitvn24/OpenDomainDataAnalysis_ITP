		<content>the south east is one of the most      
expensive areas for housing.There are  
four estate agents in Cranbrook.Prices 
range from 25,000 for a two bedroomed  
terraced cottage to a detached house   
with land for over 100,000.most houses 
in the Cranbrook area are in the       
35,000-70,000 price range which means  
that first time buyers tend to look    
elsewhere for houses.Little new housing
is being built.Recent developments have
been on the Frythe estate.Any          
improvements in the town centre are    
carefully controlled by preservation   
orders.Rural properties are very       
expensive being priced over 70,000.Many
are period houses although post second 
world war houses of character are      
available.Being in the Cranbrook school
 catchment area is an often used       
selling point by estate agents.
