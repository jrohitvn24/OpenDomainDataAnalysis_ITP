 Royal British Legion Club. They have  
 their branch headquarters in          
 Stratton-on-the-Fosse where they hold 
 their meetings, play skittles, darts, 
 snooker, pool and billiards. It has   
 got a bar which sells drinks, crisps, 
 Mars Bars and Coca-Cola. If you are a 
 member you can get in free. If not it 
 costs 50p.                            
 There is a snooker club in Stratton   
 and a Women's Institute club for      
 ladies. They have meetings once a     
 month and usually have a speaker to   
 talk about things like dressmaking and
 flower arranging.                     
 Youth Clubs are held at the Village   
 Halls in both villages. They have     
 games, dancing and music. Sometimes   
 they go on coach trips. The other
