		<content> Preston church is situated on the west
 side of the small village of          
 Preston.The graveyard is encircled by 
 a delapidated ironstone wall.There are
 various shrubs in the graveyard,      
 including yew and cypress trees.The   
 architecture of the church is very    
 similar to that of Ridlington         
 church.There is a steeple on the tower
 of the church.The ironstone of the    
 church is covered in lichen as are the
 graves.The church and the graveyard   
 is fairly well tended.The approach to 
 the church is along a lane with       
 cottages on either side leading to an 
 iron gate at the entrance of the      
 graveyard.
