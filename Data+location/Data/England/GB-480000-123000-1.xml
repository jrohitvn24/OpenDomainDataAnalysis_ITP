		<content> We have been surveying the village    
 area of Rogate which is on the borders
 of Hampshire and Sussex. It got its   
 name from the gates which used to     
 surround the village to keep out the  
 Roe deer, still plentiful in the area.
     The main body of the village is   
 clustered around the cross roads, East
 West, Petersfield to Midhurst, an old 
 coach road and North South, Hillbrow  
 to Harting,  very close to a smugglers
 route. All the main features of the   
 village are here the church, the      
 school, the shop,the village hall and 
 two large public houses.              
     Athough Petersfield, Midhurst     
 and Chichester are within  a radius   
 of fifteen miles it is a very         
 thriving active community with various
 organisations to serve the people such
 as Women's Institute, Brownies and    
 several sports clubs.                 </content>
