		<content>      On the Alstons' farm (see page 4)
 the cows are taken into the cow sheds 
 for winter during November. They are  
 put out to grass again about the      
 second week of April.  Apart from     
 Summer feed of grass, they are fed in 
 Winter on hay, maize, beet tops and   
 silage.  The value of one cow is about
 Â£500.  Two people work full time with 
 the cows.  The cows have already won  
 over 40 prizes at agricultural shows. 
                                       
      The milking parlour is about to  
 have new equipment, but at the moment 
 10 cows can be milked on one side,    
 while a second 10 are lined up on the 
 other side.  The udders are cleaned,  
 clusters are attached and the milk is 
 piped first to individual jars and    
 then into two huge cooling tanks.     
 Milking times are 4.30 a.m., 2.30 p.m.
