		<title>03MAD JACK'S</title>
		<content>     This place is called Mad Jack's   
 because a man called{John Mytton}did  
 crazy things. For example he once{rode
{a bear}down a dinner table and set    
 fire to himself to get rid of hiccups.
 He also tried to jump a five bar gate 
 with two horses and a carriage. He was
 one of{Shropshire's and England's most
{famous eccentrics.                    
                                       
   Two brothers jointly own{MAD JACKS. 
{One of the brothers lives in Yew Tree 
{House}which is on the premises.The    
 other brother lives in{LLANGOLLEN.}Yew
 Tree House, which was previously a    
 farmhouse, was built in 1884. All the 
 outbuildings, such as the cow shed,   
 have now been converted into          
 restaurants, bars and lounge bars.
