		<content>   There is no manufacturing industry  
 in this wholly agricultural area and  
 therefore no employment for workers   
 living outside the area,apart from a  
 few forestry workers and those emp_   
 loyed occassionally by the Dartmoor   
 National Park Authority.              
   With mechanisation it is possible to
 work the farms with the minimum of    
 labour,usually within the family.Simil
 arly guest houses and other establish 
 ments catering for the tourist        
 industry  are family concerns.        
   Doccombe is the only hamlet in the  
 area and a few residents commute to   
 work in Exeter or Moretonhampstead but
 there is a high proportion of retired 
 people.
