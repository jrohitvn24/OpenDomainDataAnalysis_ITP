		<content>    The village school is typical of   
 the "chapel-type" of construction of  
 the 19th century and is situated just 
 off the High Street. There are 150    
 children and 6 teachers including the 
 Headmaster. The children, aged between
 four and a half years and eleven years
 old start lessons at 9.00am. and      
 finish at 3.30.pm.                    
    Considerable changes in education  
 over the past few years have altered  
 methods of teaching drastically - not 
 least, the advent of the              
 micro-computer (in every school since 
 1984) which has made such an enormous 
 task as the Domesday Project a        
 possibility.
