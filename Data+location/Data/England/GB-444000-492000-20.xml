		<title>20A Day's Hunting:N.Silton</title>
		<content> There is a national movement which is 
 attempting to ban all blood sports.   
 However the meeting of the Bilsdale   
 Fox Hunt here is an important part of 
 village life.The hunt meets at the    
 "Gold Cup",Nether Silton where the    
 landlord acts as host providing the   
 "stirrup cup"(usually whisky)for the  
 Master of the hunt and his attendants.
 Many villagers turn out to support the
 event.                                
 The huntsmen dressed in "hunting pink"
 make a striking picture mounted on    
 horse back surrounded by the fell type
 hounds.They meet at 11 a.m. and "move 
 off" to the sound of the hunting horn 
 joined by many local riders.The hunt  
 covers difficult country &amp; the hounds 
 are expected to work independently    
 because of this.They are coloured with
 more white than usual in order that   
 they may be seen on dark moorland.    </content>
