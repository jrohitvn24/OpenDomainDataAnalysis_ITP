		<title>11LOWESWATER FARMS, SHEEP</title>
		<content> Most farms in this block keep both    
 cattle &amp; sheep, but sheep farming is  
 predominant. Main breeds are Herdwicks
 at Brackenthwaite,Buttermere and      
 Swaledales at Loweswater. Flocks are  
 heafed to the fell &amp; are transferred  
 from one tenant/owner to subsequent   
 ones. Each flock is identified by its 
 individual ear and smit mark. It is   
 traditional to winter away hoggs on   
 lowland farms. Purebred lambs are     
 reared as flock replacements. Halfbred
 gimmers from Leicester tups are sold  
 to lowland farms as breeding ewes.    
 Wethers are sold for fattening.       
 Shearing is mostly contracted out &amp;   
 the wool is sold to the Wool Marketing
 Board. Cris Todd of Kirkgate breeds   
 sheepdogs of international standard.
