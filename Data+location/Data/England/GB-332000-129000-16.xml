		<content> There is a Primary school             
 at Burrowbridge. At present 45        
 children from the village and the     
 surrounding area  attend the          
 school. They  start school in         
 September after their fourth birthday 
 and  stay at the school for 7         
 years. When they are 11 years old they
 go to either Taunton or Langport for  
 Secondary education.                  
 The school at Burrowbridge is near the
 river Parrett. It has a small         
 playground but no playing field. There
 are two full time teachers at the     
 school. Most of the children are      
 brought to school by their parents    
 because the road through the village  
 is very dangerous. There used to be a 
 taxi to take the children to school   
 but it was discontinued to save money.
