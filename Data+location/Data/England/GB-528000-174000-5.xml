		<title>05The Schools that are now</title>
		<content>    This school was built in 1903,     
which is 82 years ago. The school is   
very old and there were girls and boys 
in the school; but now there are only  
boys. There are lots of changes now.   
The classrooms have got a group of     
children - about 20 or 30 children in  
one classroom. The classes have got    
their own share of work around the     
school because we don't walk around the
school because we have it in the       
classroom. The classrooms have changed,
the artroom was the PE centre and the  
staffroom was a classroom. The         
Secretary's office was the staffroom   
and the dinner centre wasn't built.
