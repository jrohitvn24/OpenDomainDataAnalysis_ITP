  Our area contains three main         
 villages, Old Wives Lees, Chilham and 
 Shottenden.Old Wives Lees is a quiet  
 little village mostly surrounded by   
 farmland and woods. Chilham is also a 
 small village with many old houses.   
 Shottenden is quite small too and is  
 off the main road.Much of these       
 villages is farmland.There are fruit  
 farms, farms that keep animals, crop  
 farms growing such crops as wheat and 
 barley. The main roads lead from      
 Canterbury to Maidstone and Canterbury
 to Ashford. The river Stour runs near 
 Chilham and it is a small, fast       
 flowing river with fish in it.The lake
 at Chilham was once a large gravel pit
 but now it is a lake with lots of     
 wildlife.
