		<title>11NATURE RESERVE IN BRADWELL</title>
		<content>   A nature reserve was set up in the  
 grounds of{Woodlands Middle School}at 
 the beginning of 1984.                
   The headteacher, a keen             
 conservationist, was concerned when   
 mature trees were cut down near the   
 school to make way for new homes. At  
 the same time a row of elms were      
 felled, killed by Dutch elm disease.  
   A sponsored maths test raised over  
 Â£1000. Then a part of the school field
 was ploughed up and during the year   
 nearly 2400 trees were planted. A     
 large pond has been dug which, it is  
 hoped, will attract animals such as   
 badgers, squirrels, rabbits, voles,   
 mice and foxes. It is also hoped that 
 many kinds of birds will use the area 
 as a nesting site and many bird boxes 
 have been put up.In the pond we hope  
 to attract frogs, newts and toads.
