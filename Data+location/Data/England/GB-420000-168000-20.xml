		<title>20MILDENHALL:TRAFFIC ON THE A4</title>
		<content> The{A4,}which runs to the south of    
 Mildenhall, is the main road in this  
 area.The speed limit is 30mph in      
 villages and 60mph normally.As a      
 result of our survey, which was       
 carried out in pouring rain between   
 1.30 and 2.30 on Tuesday 25 June,we   
 counted 315 cars,64 lorries and 42    
 vans.Coming out of Marlborough there  
 were more vans than lorries but going 
 into Marlborough there were more      
 lorries than vans.This might imply    
 that lorries go through Marlborough   
 to go to Bath, Bristol etc and return 
 later in the day or early the next    
 morning.We also counted 4 motorbikes, 
 2 caravans,4 buses,3 cycles,1 tractor 
 and 1 ambulance.The lack of cycles and
 motorbikes might be explained by the  
 rain.The 2 caravans might be explained
 by the start of the holiday season.
