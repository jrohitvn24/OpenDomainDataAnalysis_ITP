		<title>18LYME REGIS LIFE BOAT</title>
		<content> There has been an Atlantic 21 lifeboat
 at Lyme Regis since 1967. It's maximum
 speed is 30 knots, width 7'6" and     
 length 22'9". It cost about Â£25,000   
 and has a radius of action of 50      
 miles. It is kept on a trolley in the 
 Lifeboat house at the Cobb. On average
 it is called out about twice a week   
 during the summer season and once a   
 fortnight in winter.It is called into 
 action when the coastguards receive a 
 999 call and then two maroons are     
 fired. The coxwain is John Hodder, and
 Paul Wason is a senior helmsman (he   
 has been on the crew 9 years). The    
 boat is crewed by 3 men (or 4 at      
 night) and there are 14 volunteers at 
 Lyme Regis to call upon.
