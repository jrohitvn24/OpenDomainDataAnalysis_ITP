 This is a very small village on the   
 A689 to Hartlepool.It has a farm,a few
 farm cottages,a Public House and a    
 Garage.There is a Mill in the village 
 but it is no longer in use.           
                                       
{Wolviston                             
{                                      
 In the centre of the village is The   
 Village Green.It has many beautiful   
 trees.Facing The Green is Wolviston   
 Primary School.                       
 We have a large duck pond in the      
 village which is visited by a good    
 variety of birds.The village children 
 like to fish in the pond.             
 The village has a High Street where   
 all the shops can be found.
