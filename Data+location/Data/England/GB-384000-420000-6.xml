		<content>      There are five primary schools in
 our area.Western and Thorn are county 
 primary schools, St Josephs is a Roman
 Catholic primary school, Tunstead and 
 St. Saviours are Church of England    
 Primary Schools. Western and St       
 Saviours have got 4 classes. Thorn and
 Tunstead have got 7 classes and St    
 Josephs has got 5 classes.All of these
 schools were built in Victorian times 
 about one hundred years ago, but St.  
 Saviours school was falling down so   
 they had to move into temporary       
 classrooms in Bacup Park. Our school, 
 Tunstead, was built in 1881, but it is
 in such bad condition that we are     
 having a  new one built for next year.
 Most children go to Fearns Secondary  
 School when they are 11. It is the    
 biggest Secondary School in           
 Lancashire.
