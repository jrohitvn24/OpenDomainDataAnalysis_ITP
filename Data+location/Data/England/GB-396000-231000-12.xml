		<content> The small farming families have been  
 unable to compete on the open market  
 with the large financial interests of 
 the big banks and business syndicates 
 and have reluctantly sold out when    
 family changes have occurred.This     
 process has accelerated since entering
 the E.E.C..Other directives from this 
 body are exampled by one farm which   
 has switched from dairy to beef stock.
 Increased economic ambition amongst   
 the larger syndicates has demanded    
 larger units resulting in the         
 disappearance of the hedgerows and the
 medieval field patterns,the           
 traditional pattern of farmhouse      
 surrounded by its fields;and the      
 community which was once dependent    
 upon the farmer.
