		<content>                                       
                                       
The Spinney is a meadow and lots of    
trees where the Guides, Brownies, Cubs 
and Scouts from Boxford camp.  Other   
Scouts, Cubs, Guides and Brownies can  
use it as well.  Public people can use 
it too.                                
                                       
In four years the Guides, Brownies,    
Cubs and Scouts have raised 14,000     
pounds towards building a hut for      
meetings, they need 8,000 pounds more. 
They have grants of 4,500 pounds from  
the Silver Jubilee Trust.  They raised 
the money by having jumble sales and   
doing odd jobs for people.  They are   
hoping to have it finished by January  
1986.
