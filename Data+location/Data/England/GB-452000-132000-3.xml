		<content> On the 11th of June 1985 four people  
 from{Itchen Abbas School}went to the  
 table trout farm in Itchen Abbas. A   
 table trout farm is a farm where they 
 sell trout to eat. There are          
{1.2 million trout.}They have to be fed
 every other hour. They are fed brown  
 food pellets with extra vitamins in   
 them. The farm started in 1978 and is 
 still going well.{Rainbow Trout}are   
 easier to farm than{Brown Trout   }   
 because they grow more quickly.       
 In the farm we visited there were 45  
 tanks there are 50,000 fish 7cm long  
 25,000 fish 15cm long 50,000 fish     
 5cm long 25,000 fish 18cm long. 10,000
 fish 30,000 and 12,000 fish 40cm. 500 
 fish in pets corner are 65cm long.    
 They grade three tons of trout in one 
 hour. 100,000 fish come in every three
 weeks. The trout are in the farm for  
 eight to nine months.   Sarah Diaper  </content>
