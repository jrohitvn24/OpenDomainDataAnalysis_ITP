		<content>              At Carleton there is a   
 park which includes swings, a slide   
 and a climbing frame. After school we 
 have many clubs to do with music and  
 sport. The leisure centre nearest to  
 Carleton is the Thornton Sports       
 Centre. There are many activities     
 including squash, tennis and          
 gymnastics. There is a dancing centre 
 at Carleton. You can take Tap, Ballet 
 and Modern lessons. Dancing is a very 
 expensive hobby, but it is very       
 enjoyable. The most enjoyable free    
 games seem to be Tig and Hide-and-Seek
 .These games have been played for many
 years. They both include running, and 
 can be played at any time of the year.
