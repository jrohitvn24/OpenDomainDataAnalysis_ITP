		<title>14LIFE AT GUY HILL</title>
		<content> Although life in this area can be very
 quiet the place is not really remote. 
 Old Moor Road, although not busy, as  
 there is an alternative, more direct  
 route for general traffic, is kept    
 clear during winter because it is used
 commonly by milk tankers. The dustbins
 are emptied once a week, milk is      
 delivered daily, buses pass the top   
 of the road regulary and there is a   
 good selection of shops less than 3   
 miles away in High Bentham. The       
 community is very friendly and Lowgill
 church is well attended. Both the WI  
 and Village Society are active        
 organisations and attract a wide range
 of local people. Education is no      
 problem either as there is a good     
 primary school in Lowgill less than 3 
 miles away and a good selection of    
 secondary schools within a few miles.
