		<content>      On a 22-acre holding, employing  
 two, there is an annual output of 35  
 tonnes of wheat, 14 tonnes of barley, 
 all fed to the pigs.                  
      At any one time, 1000 pigs are on
 site, including 90 breeding sows and 5
 boars.  Each sow has 2.2 litter per   
 year (one has had 14 litters and      
 reared 134 pigs).                     
      Each sow eats 1 tonne of food per
 year.  Over 400 tonnes is milled,     
 mixed and fed to the pigs annually.   
 About 1750 pigs go to market every    
 year, representing about 400 tonnes of
 meat.  Six thousand bales of straw are
 baled, stacked and spread.            
      We cart 350 tonnes of farmyard   
 manure and spread it annually on Mr.  
 Sly's land for his potatoes, onions   
 and sugar beet.                       
      After doing this, we can sit and 
 watch the grass grow.      P. Hall    </content>
