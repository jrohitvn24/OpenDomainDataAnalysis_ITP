		<title>20Angling In Kingswood.</title>
		<content>   The hobby of{Angling}is very popular
 amongst young people In Kingswood. I  
 recently went{fishing}on the River    
 Avon at Swineford with my friends.    
 When we got there we found a spot and 
 started to{fish}I landed the first    
 eel, it had swallowed the{hook}which  
 was hard to get out. Then I{cast}out  
 but the leger hit a tree and I lost   
 it. A leger is large weight which     
 helps the{angler}to{cast}out a long   
 way. I had to start again but it      
 did not take long. My friend caught   
 another{eel}and we put it in the      
{keepnet. }Our biggest catch was a     
{Chub,}about 14 inches long. The       
 average size of an adult{Chub}is 23   
 inches. Other{fish}which may be caught
 in this stretch of{river}are{Perch,   
{Carp, Dace, Gudgeon and Pike. Eels}are
 a nuisance because they tangle in the 
 net. My{rod}is made of{fibreglass.    </content>
