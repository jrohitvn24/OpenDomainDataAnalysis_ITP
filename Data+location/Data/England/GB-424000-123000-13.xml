		<title>13Free Churches-Whiteparish</title>
		<content> The number of Free Church chapels in  
 the village has decreased from 3 to 1 
 in the last 60 yrs.{A Primitive       
{Methodist}chapel in Clay Street closed
 in 1932 &amp; a dwelling on the South of  
 the school was once a meeting place   
 for the{Plymouth Brethren.}The        
{Wesleyan Methodist}chapel in Dean Lane
 dates from 1859 succeeding another,   
 site unknown. Services-twice each     
 Sunday-led by a local preacher        
 (av.Attendance-10). Sunday School -   
 9.45. Women's Bright Hour -twice      
 monthly. Intercession group-once      
 monthly. Bible study-weekly in Autumn 
 &amp; Winter in a member's home. This     
 group, though small, has great        
 potential - from them has emanated the
 Friendship Club for Senior Citizens &amp; 
 a committee to raise money for        
 Christian Aid, &amp; three members are    
 local preachers.                      </content>
