		<title>07GEOLOGY OF LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content>   The underlying solid geology of the 
 Baddow region is London clay with     
 overlying Quaternary and Alluvial     
 deposits. Baddow is bounded by the    
 Chelmer flood plain and hilly clay    
 relief. The Chelmer river has produced
 two terraces by fluvial erosion. These
 are composed of fine silts which have 
 been deposited by tthe meandering path
 of the river. The clay relief is the  
 result of a great amount of deposition
 during the Ecocene period and as a    
 result of minor earth movement an     
 undulating landscape has developed.   
   Quaternary deposits from British    
 glacial movements of the last 400     
 years can be found here, especially   
 evident are sands and gravels from the
 outwash plains of the Anglian and     
 Devensian glaciations. Some of these  
 deposits have been slightly eroded by 
 weathering action.                    </content>
