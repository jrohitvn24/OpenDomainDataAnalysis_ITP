<title>15Updated Somerstown, how things change</title>
<content>Somers Town is in the north west part of London and the flats are quite big and most of the flats have a good view of the chaos below. What I like best is the fact you don't have to visit this place. There is always a bad vibe, youths hanging round and plenty of crime should you wish to partake. Somers Town sed to have a lot of fields and farms before the railways, this however is not a factor in everyday life. Rather than the noise from the train on the way to school, the scary thing has become weather you will get to school or not. There are no nice buildings in Somers Town in 2011, it's run down because there are lots stolen property (cars, bikes etc) and the village "chav" is an abundant feature. Busy business men and women have no place here. There is lots of rubbish although it is cleaned, sometimes. On the streets there are dangers like cracked paving stones, needles and "happy slapping".&lt;br />
