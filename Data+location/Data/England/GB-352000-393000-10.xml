		<content>     This gives  plenty  of scope for  
 rambling, bird  watching, having  a   
 picnic, studying  pond life, tracing  
 the  line  of  the  canal,  jogging,  
 dog-walking,  or  simply  finding  a  
 grassy  bank  to  sit  and enjoy the  
 scenery. The day we went to the valley
 we went into the visitors centre and  
 asked some questions:-                
                                       
 "When did work for the re-development 
 of the  valley start?  "The secretary 
 told  us, "The work  began  in 1976." 
 At  that  one of the  rangers told us 
 that, "The  rangers  came in 1979 and 
 this  Visitors Centre  was  built  in 
 1982."  Our  next  question was, "How 
 many  people  are  employed at Sankey 
 Valley?" The  ranger  answered "There 
 are  four  full-time  rangers,  a     
 part-time ranger  and  the secretary.
