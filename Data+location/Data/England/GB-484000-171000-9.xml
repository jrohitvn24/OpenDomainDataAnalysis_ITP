		<content> In our area people go to work in      
 Bracknell. Most people travel to work 
 by car because it is faster than the  
 bus. The most popular job was to make 
 computers, radars and other electrical
 goods. Most people who are employed   
 work full time and work from six to   
 ten hours each day. Most people's     
 companies are linked up by a computer.
 The most anybody has been in a job was
 for thirty years. Some people would be
 prepared to go to Wales to get a job  
 whereas 7% of the male population are 
 unemployed. The farthest away anybody 
 we interviewed worked was 31.25 miles 
 away.                                 
 Only a few people have children that  
 are employed. There are a lot of      
 shopkeepers in Binfield. Not many     
 people do shift work. 60% of women    
 interviewed have a part time job      
 mainly in the local area.             </content>
