		<content>     Most of the land around the South 
 Andover area is used for intensive    
 crop farming. Wheat and barley are the
 main crops, but they also grow peas,  
 beans and rape in large quantities.   
 Most farmers use fertilisers such as  
 nitrogen but most are trying to cut   
 down on this. The crops are also      
 sprayed with insecticides, fungicides 
 and herbicides to prevent weeds, fungi
 and insects destroying the crop.      
     Many different types of machinery 
 are used on the farms including       
 tractors, ploughs, seed-drills,       
 harrows, sprayers, bailers, combine   
 harvesters and fork-lift trucks. The  
 farm workers rely on the machines for 
 most of the jobs on the farm.         
     As well as crops, most farms in   
 the area keep some cattle. Most keep  
 dairy cattle, but some use their      
 poorer lands for beef cattle.         </content>
