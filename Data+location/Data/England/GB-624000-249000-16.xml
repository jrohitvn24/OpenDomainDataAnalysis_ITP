 The{Regatta,}which has been going for 
 5 years, is held during a weekend     
 early in July. River events include   
 raft, rowing, canoe-ing, swimming and 
 sailing races, and trips from Everson 
 point to the Melton area(approx. 1m.).
 On shore are attractions such as a    
 marching band, tug-of-war, pillow     
 fights,and stalls.                    
 The{Museum}was started in 1982 with   
 money bequeathed by local lady Ruth   
 Haywood.It is run by volunteers and   
 opened to the public from April to    
 October. In one room there are some   
 photos of the nearby{Sutton Hoo       
{burial}.(the real treasure is in the  
{British Museum}).Admission charges in 
 1985 are: adults 30p and children     
 under fourteen get in free.           
 The{Shire Hall,}on market hill is well
 worth a visit also . (see page 8.)    </content>
