  We live in Whitehawk, an estate built
 in the 1930s.It is being redeveloped. 
 These are the results of an interveiw 
 with Mr. Danes, an architect for the  
 town in charge of the work:           
 The new houses will last{10 years     
 longer than the old ones. The new     
 houses cost{Â£30,000}each. The project 
 has cost{Â£25,000,000}and at 1985      
 prices the whole finished project will
 have cost{Â£55,000,000}and{5836}       
 people will have been rehoused. The   
 project started in{1976}and will be   
 completed in{1990/1.}The new houses   
 are insulated in the windows, the     
 front door,the walls and the roof. In 
 the new old peoples home there are    
 fire doors and alarms. The amenities  
 they will be building are: Three      
 tennis courts,a 5 a-side football
