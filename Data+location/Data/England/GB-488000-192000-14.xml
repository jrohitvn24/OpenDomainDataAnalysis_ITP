		<title>14Transport - Traffic Survey</title>
		<content> A survey taken for 30 mins gave the   
 following results.                    
 Cars Vans Lorries Motorbikes Others   
 73%  17%  7%      10%         2%      
 The preponderance of cars is not      
 particularly surprising when one      
 considers that the school is in a     
 residential area. Of the vans seen 80%
 had a clear domestic purpose.         
 VEHICLE OWNERSHIP  The dominance of   
 the private car was confirmed in a    
 survey of 200 households. 79% had 1 or
 more cars and of these 28% had 2 or   
 more. 14% had more than 2 cars.       
 Surprisingly these households had an  
 average of 3 pedal bikes each, though 
 none was seen in the traffic survey.  
 From this it can be deduced that most 
 are owned by children and used for    
 weekend recreation.
