		<title>06Crawshaw's Hill</title>
		<content> Crawshaw's Hill is a well-known       
 feature of the landscape in this area.
 It is a steep hill which rises some 60
 metres in a distance of 200 metres.   
 For most of the year it is used by a  
 number of horse owners to graze their 
 ponies and horses.In the middle ages  
 the butts were located here for this  
 was where the young men of the village
 came to practise their archery.In the 
 early years of the Civil War there was
 a Royalist artillery emplacement here 
 until it was overrun by a             
 Parliamentarian force in 1643.A fall  
 of snow really brings the hill alive  
 for then it is invaded by young people
 eager to use their toboggans,sledges  
 and even polythene bags to propel     
 themselves whooping and shrieking on  
 their way to the bottom.
