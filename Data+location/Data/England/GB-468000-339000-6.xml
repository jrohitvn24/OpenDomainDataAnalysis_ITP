		<content>    Children from the Toot Hill and    
 Robert Miles schools conducted surveys
 to find out about the sorts of jobs   
 that the residents of Bingham do and  
 where they go to work. 40% of the     
 people work in Bingham itself. Over a 
 quarter travelled to work in          
 Nottingam. Although Bingham is a      
 market town and in an agricultural    
 area, only 1% work in{agriculture}.   
 Nearly 70% work in{service industries 
 like{shops and local government.      
 Nearly a quarter work in{manufacturing
 on the small industrial estate in     
 Bingham, or in Nottingham. A few      
 people work in{mining or construction.
    Three quarters of the people work  
 full time with 4% unemployed. Just    
 over half the people use a car to get 
 to work, and nearly a third walk or   
 use a bicycle because they have jobs  
 nearby.                               </content>
