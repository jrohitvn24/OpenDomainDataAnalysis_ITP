		<content>   There are no trunk or major roads   
 passing through the area although the 
 M6 motorway, opened in 1970, passes   
 through the south west corner of the  
 block.                                
   Orton village is situated at the    
 crossroads of the B6260 road _ Kendal 
 to Appleby in Westmorland _ and the   
 B6261 road _ Kirkby Stephen to Shap.  
 There are numerous other minor roads, 
 serving the hamlets in the area, and  
 many tracks and lanes leading to      
 isolated farmsteads and cottages.     
   Although the main west coast railway
 route passes through the area the     
 nearest railway stations are at       
 Oxenholme (12 miles south) and Penrith
 (14 miles north).                     
   Ribble Motor Services and           
 Braithwaites of Tebay provide a public
 transport service to and from the     
 area. Many workers use private cars.  </content>
