		<title>13FLORA AND FAUNA.</title>
		<content>   The area is well off for natural    
 resources and especially so for plants
 and wildlife.                         
   On Caldy Hill there are nearly 120  
 different species of plants and       
 flowers that have been identified.    
   The wildlife consists mainly of     
 animals such as badgers,foxes,rabbits,
 grey squirrels,grass snakes,lizards   
 and many other species of animals and 
 insects.                              
   One of the less savoury aspects of  
 the wildlife are the problems that are
 being caused by visitors who are      
 badger baiting.At the present time    
 there is only one active badger set   
 in the area and that is being closely 
 watched by local conservation groups  
 in the hope that it can be saved.     
   Foxes are also quite numerous and   
 often come into housing areas         
 scavenging for food.                  </content>
