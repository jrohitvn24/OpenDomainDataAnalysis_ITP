		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF BRIAN.</title>
		<content> A typical Saturday for me would be to 
 get up at 8.30. Then at about 8.45    
 I would go in to the village to buy a 
 paper.At about 10.00 I normally have  
 my breakfast with my wife Jayne and my
 two kids Mark and Lesley.After        
 breakfast I normally help to do the   
 housework then I sit down and watch   
 the television until 12.00. In the    
 afternoon I usually take the car and  
  go to the Club to play snooker with  
 two of my work mates Jim and Simon.At 
 about 3.00 I normally go back home to 
 watch the sport on television and go  
 to to sleep for a while. At 6.00 I    
 have my tea with my family then I bath
 the children and put them to bed.If we
 can get a baby sitter my wife and I   
 will go to a friends, or for a meal,  
 or just for a drink. We usually go to 
 to bed at about 12 O'clock.
