		<content> Close to my home are some woods.When  
 you walk through them you can see many
 interesting things.There are          
 foxgloves, harebells, dog daisies,    
 speedwell, buttercups, violets,       
 daisies and stitchwort.These flowers  
 grow in the clearings between the     
 trees.Most of the trees are rowans,   
 silver birch, ash or sycamore but     
 there are some larch and pine trees   
 too.                                  
 The trees often have fungi growing on 
 them in the autumn.                   
 If you are quiet,you may see rabbits, 
 squirrels, or even stoats in the wood.
 Magpies, jays, blue tits, great tits, 
 wood pigeons and blackbirds fly about 
 overhead and on the  small pond you   
 can see mallards and moorhens.        
 There are patches of bracken that are 
 fun to hide in and also bilberry and  
 blackberry bushes that aren't.        </content>
