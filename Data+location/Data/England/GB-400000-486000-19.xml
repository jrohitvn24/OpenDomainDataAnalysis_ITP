		<title>19THE SCHOOL, WEST BURTON</title>
		<content> Our village school has a grand title: 
 Burton-cum-Walden, West Burton,       
 Robinson's Memorial CE School. It was 
 built in 1874 by the Robinson sisters 
 in memory of their father, William    
 Robinson. It is controlled by North   
 Yorkshire Education Committee. The    
 school has two main classrooms,       
 cloakrooms, a small dining room and a 
 kitchen. Toilets are outside across a 
 yard. There is a garden with climbing 
 frames but the main playground is the 
 village green. In 1985 there are 49   
 pupils aged 4 - 11, two full-time     
 teachers, a part-time teacher (9 hours
 weekly) and a secretary (7 hours      
 weekly). Children come from West      
 Burton, Thoralby, part of Aysgarth and
 from Walden valley and Bishopdale.    
 Most children come to school by taxi. 
 At 11 they go to the Wensleydale      
 Comprehensive School at Leyburn.      </content>
