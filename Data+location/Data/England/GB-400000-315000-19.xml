		<title>19School Holidays in Rugeley</title>
		<content>                                       
  The school year is divided into 3    
terms, Autumn term, Spring term and    
Winter term. At the end of each term is
a holiday, usually 2 weeks long, but   
the summer holiday lasts for 6 weeks.  
  During the week Saturday and Sunday  
are days we do not go to school, when  
we can do what we like.                
  In the middle of each term we have   
half term holidays which last for 1    
week.                                  
  How the holidays are spent is a      
matter of choice. Most families go     
away for a holiday at least once a     
year, usually to the seaside, either   
in Great Britain or abroad.
