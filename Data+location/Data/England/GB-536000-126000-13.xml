		<title>13The Life of Older People</title>
		<content>   The old people in the village have  
 few facilities like the Ivy Leaf club 
 in the village hall. The Ivy Leaf club
 provides a weekly opportunity for the 
 elderly people to get together, have  
 tea and chat. Some weeks they go for  
 outings,others they sit and talk.About
 twenty members attend each Wednesday. 
   The British Legion Club has things  
 like bar pool tables and dartboards.  
 It is open every day for people from  
 fifteen to eighty.                    
    Westall House is an old people's   
 home. There are fourteen bungalows for
 active retired employees of the De La 
 Rue Company.                          
   The elderly people would like things
 like better footpaths and street      
 lighting, better bus services and     
 improved housing. There is also a CB  
 network in the village to help        
 older people (see page 14).           </content>
