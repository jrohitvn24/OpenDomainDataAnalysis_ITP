		<title>11RECREATION, HAYDON BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The majority of our farmers &amp; their   
 families hunt, or ride horses for     
 pleasure. We are part of the Haydon   
 Hunt country which harbours many      
 foxes.{Fishing}is popular. Some is in 
 private hands but permits and licences
 can be obtained in the village for    
 salmon, trout &amp; coarse fishing.{Game &amp;
{vermin shooting}is in private hands   
 but poachers do exist.{Cricket}is     
 popular. The Haydon Bridge C.C. uses  
 the High School's ground &amp; plays in   
 West Tyne leagues. It has several     
 disconcerting bowlers &amp; batsmen who   
 are difficult to get out. Many of our 
 young people join the Haydon Bridge   
 Football club, or Scouts, Guides, Cubs
 &amp; Brownies. All are welcome to play   
 Squash at the High School Sports      
 Centre &amp; the School Hall is used for  
 Plays, Dances &amp; Concerts.
