		<content> There is quite a high proportion of   
 modern housing in East Wellow. There  
 are, however, a number of Victorian   
 houses and notably, a number of       
 cottages which date back to Tudor     
 times, although they have been much   
 restored.                             
                                       
 Many of the houses are large with a   
 high proportion having between three  
 and five bedrooms. On the main road we
 found some smaller two bedroomed      
 houses. There is one council estate on
 the main Romsey to Salisbury road.    
 Otherwise the houses are privately    
 owned with quite a few containing     
 tenants who work as farm labourers.   
                                       
 Some of the older houses have thatched
 rooves. Most of these were in a good  
 state of repair thanks to the efforts 
 of the local thatcher.                </content>
