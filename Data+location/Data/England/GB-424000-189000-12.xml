		<title>12A Day In My Life June 28th</title>
		<content>In the afternoon we had a club         
afternoon.There are about ten different
clubs pottery,art,cooking etc.At three 
O.clock we went home.When I got home I 
played my new computer game called Spy 
Hunter.I was hoping to camp over night 
in the garden in a tent but I couldÂ£nt 
because of the weather.After supper I  
watched an exciting program called the 
Mad Death,it was about what would      
happen if rabies came to Britain,it was
very interesting.i went to bed at ten.
