		<content> The Smithy was built about 1890 and   
 was used as such until 1965, when it  
 fell into disuse and was used as a    
 garage shed. The present owner, Mr    
 Green, put it back into use as a      
 smithy in 1976. Mr Green, who works on
 his own, makes wrought iron gates,    
 fireplaces, repairs farm implements   
 and some buildings, as well as shoeing
 horses. Mr Green travels all over     
 the area and shoes about 300 horses   
 a year. He has 20 different sizes of  
 horseshoe.
