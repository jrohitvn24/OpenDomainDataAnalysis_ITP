		<content> Monson Road, Northorpe is named after 
 a 17C family with Civil War connec-   
 tions (some think Northorpe may have  
 been the scene of fighting in that    
 war);the church has a memorial to     
 William Monson, eldest son of John and
 Mary Monson, who died in 1638. River  
 Eau, pronounced Ee, looks French but  
 is of Scandianvian derivation.Crapple 
 Lane, Scotton (derivation uncertain,  
 possibly from Crabapple) was already  
 so named in 1682.Scotton Church is    
 most unusually dedicated to St Genewys
 a name most probably of French origin.
 Some think it is a corruption of      
 Genevieve.However a 19C memorial      
 window in the church refers to St     
 Genewys, Bishop of Clermont: there was
 a 7C Bishop Genes of Glermont (in the 
 Auvergne), but how a church in a tiny 
 North Lincolnshire village came to be 
 dedicated to him remains a mystery.   </content>
