		<title>18BOATING ASSOCIATION</title>
		<content> The Ravenglass Boating Association was
 formed 5 yrs.ago to prevent the M.O.D.
 from cutting off boating access to the
 harbour completely.It now provides    
 talks,courses and a way of learning   
 about boats and the sea.The secretary 
 is Mr.Alan Routledge of Havercroft,   
 Seascale,Cumbria.There are 130 members
 and they meet in the Pennington Arms  
 regularly.The anchorage is very       
 sheltered but it only has a channel to
 sea for 2\ hrs. either side of high   
 tide:when the tide comes in it comes  
 in fast.In the'5 Peaks'race in the    
 summer Ravenglass is the harbour used 
 for access to Scafell Pike(highest    
 mountain in England).Cruising and     
 sailing are the most popular types of 
 boating though some enthusiasts fish, 
 sail-board, water-ski and speedboat.A 
 comercial trawler also sails from     
 Ravenglass.                           </content>
