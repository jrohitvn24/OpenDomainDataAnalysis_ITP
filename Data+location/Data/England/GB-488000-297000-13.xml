		<title>13The Harringworth Viaduct 1</title>
		<content>    The most distinctive feature of the
 landscape in this area of South-east  
 Rutland is the railway viaduct        
 spanning the River Welland between    
 Seaton ans Harringworth. Completed in 
 1878, this viaduct is still a         
 masterpiece of industrial             
 architecture. It is still used by     
 goods trains, and very occasionally   
 passenger trains are diverted across  
 it.                                   
                                       
    The Viaduct is three-quarters of a 
 mile long, with 82 arches, each with a
 span of 40 feet and a height of almost
 60 feet. It contains 20 million       
 bricks, 20 thousand cubic yards of    
 concrete and 90 thousand cubic yards  
 of stone. If the bricks were used to  
 pave a pathway 5 feet 3 inches wide,  
 it would stretch from London to York.
