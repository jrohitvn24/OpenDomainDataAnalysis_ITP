		<content>{Leominster}is a small market town with
 a population of nearly 10,000 set in  
 the heart of the Herefordshire        
 countryside. To the north on the A49  
 is Ludlow and Shrewsbury, to the south
 is the city of Hereford. Thirty miles 
 to the east is the city of Worcester, 
 which has been the county headquarters
 of Hereford and Worcester since       
 amalgamation in 1974. Twenty miles to 
 the west is the Welsh border and      
 beyond that the Black Mountains and   
 the Brecon Beacons. {                 
{Leominster}is the main shopping area  
 for the farming community and the     
 surrounding district.                 
 During the summer tourists abound,    
 visiting the pleasant countryside and 
 looking at the black and white houses 
 in the town. The Priory and Grange    
 Court are other places well worth a   
 visit.                                </content>
