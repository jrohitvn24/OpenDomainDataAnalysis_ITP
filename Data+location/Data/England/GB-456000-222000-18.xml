		<content>DURING The 2nd World War,Bicester      
managed to escape most of the bombing. 
In fact,many children from London were 
evacuated here.Belgian refugees also   
found shelter in the town.             
A bomb was dropped near the railway    
when the German pilot unloaded it on   
his way home.It did not explode and was
defused successfully.                  
Two soldiers stationed in Bicester had 
an argument in the Regal cinema and    
when the fight was over, the girl was  
found dead.
