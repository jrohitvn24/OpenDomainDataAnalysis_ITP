		<title>11ST JOHN THE BAPTIST CHURCH</title>
		<content>  St John the Baptist Church is a large
 red brick building and in 1985 it     
 celebrates its centenary.Our school is
 the only primary school attached to   
 the Church of England in Leicester.On 
 May 20th 1884 the foundation stone was
 laid.Money for the church was given by
 Miss Barlow and in 1885 an eminent    
 congregation came to the opening      
 service on September 17th.They came by
 steam train,tram,coach and horses or  
 walked.Today people go to church by   
 car,bus or walk.It has a small        
 churchyard and is surrounded by a     
 mixture of large Victorian and newer  
 houses.The windows are stone arches in
 opaque glass with coloured ones near  
 the altar.Wooden pews,on a wood block 
 floor,hold 10 people.Inside the tall  
 walls are of yellow grey brick with a 
 strong,wooden roof.The inside is dark.
