		<content>   Todmorden lies at the confluence of 
 two glacial valleys, which were formed
 at the end of the last ice-age by     
 glacial melt waters.These valleys are 
 deep, narrow and have steep sides.The 
 River Calder flows through a gorge,   
 which is a glacial overflow channel,  
 and joins Walsden Water in the centre 
 of Todmorden.                         
  The rocks are almost entirely made of
 Millstone Grit and Shale.As it's name 
 suggests Millstone Grit, which is a   
 kind of very hard sandstone, was once 
 used in mills to grind corn.It is     
 impervious and provides good sites for
 reservoirs.Dozens of reservoirs on the
 moors around Todmorden have been used 
 to provide water for water wheels in  
 mills, drinking water and for topping 
 up the Rochdale Canal.Millstone Grit  
 also provives the distinctive building
 stone in this part of the Pennines.   </content>
