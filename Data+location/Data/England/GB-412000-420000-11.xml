		<content> The town grew up on banks of the      
 River Calder and has spread up on to  
 the surrounding hillsides as the years
 have gone by. In the last few years   
 the major roads have been stopped from
 going through the town with the       
 building of a four lane roadway, which
 takes traffic to the north and east of
 the town centre.                      
 Shops,banks, public houses, offices   
 and supermarkets are all within easy  
 walking distance of the free car parks
 and to make shopping even easier, cars
 can be parked on streets. Many of the 
 shops belong to families who live in  
 the town. At both ends of Commercial  
 Street there are supermarkets, and at 
 the western end of the town centre    
 there is a modern area of traffic free
 shops known as the Wellington Arcade.
