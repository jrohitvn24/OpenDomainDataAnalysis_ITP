		<title>03Bourton's Attractions (1)</title>
		<content> Of the many attractions in Bourton-   
 on-the-Water,{Birdland}is perhaps the 
 best known. Set in a{beautiful garden,
 created by Leonard Hill, a local      
 builder, who collected{exotic birds   
 from all over the world - Macaws,     
 Toucans, Cockatoos, Cranes, and       
 Flamingoes - but especially the{South 
{Sea Penguins}which may be seen through
 underwater viewing. There is also a   
 Tropical House with Humming Birds, a  
 unique Shell-Land and an{Art Gallery  
 and{Museum.}Another popular attraction
 is the{Model Village}in the garden of 
 the Old New Inn, owned by a well known
 local family. It is a replica of      
 Bourton and was started in 1936 by the
 landlord, Mr. Morris, with the help of
 six local craftsmen. Each building has
 been reproduced on a one-ninth scale. 
 The organ plays in the church and the 
 mill wheel on the Windrush revolves.  </content>
