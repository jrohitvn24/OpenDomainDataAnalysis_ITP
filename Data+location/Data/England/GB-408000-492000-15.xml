		<content>  Most entertainment partaken by the   
 people of Bellerby requires them to   
 travel varying distances. Many        
 children belong to Guides or Scouts in
 Leyburn. They travel to Richmond      
 swimming baths once a week on hired   
 transport and hold regular weekend    
 camps in various places in the dale.  
  Theatre goers can enjoy plays put on 
 by the Amateur Dramatic Society in    
 Leyburn, but for a performance by     
 professionals, journeys to Darlington,
 Harrogate or Newcastle are required.  
 The nearest cinema is in Northallerton
 17 miles away.                        
  Eating out is a popular form of      
 recreation for many people and the    
 dales villages have a growing number  
 of excellent restaurants, well        
 supported by local people as well as  
 tourists.
