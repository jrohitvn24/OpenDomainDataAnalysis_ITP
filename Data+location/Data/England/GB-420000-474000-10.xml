		<title>10FARMING KIRKBY MALZEARD AREA</title>
		<content> An area of pasture &amp; meadow land      
 between the Pennine moors &amp; the Vale  
 of York.Mainly{self-owned family farms
 of about 100acres{.Dairy &amp; Beef cattle
 &amp;{sheep}are equally important.{Poultry
{&amp; Pigs}kept on a very small scale.{Hay
{&amp; Silage}are the only crops,with straw
 bought in from nearby areas.Some      
 village farms are smaller, a few      
 worked on a part-time basis. Few      
 employ outside labour being mainly run
 by fathers &amp; sons. One farmer supplies
 a doorstep delivery of{farm-bottled   
{milk.}The rest send milk by tanker for
 processing. In 1984 the E.E.C. imposed
 a dairy quota on the British farmer   
 causing, in this area, a cut back in  
 dairy herds. Cattle &amp; Sheep are bought
 &amp; sold at local{auction marts.}1/3 of 
 this area now qualifies for some      
 financial aid as 'marginal' land      
 (E.E.C. 1985).                        </content>
