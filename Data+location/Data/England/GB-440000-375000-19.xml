 area linking Sheffield with Midland   
 counties.The nearest station with     
 access to passenger routes is         
 Chesterfield where there is a rapid   
 service to London.Barrow Hill used to 
 have a station but it was closed in   
 the first set of Beeching cuts.There  
 is an extensive network of sidings,   
 branch lines and mineral railways     
 constructed to serve the industrial   
 needs of the area.There is a large    
 amount of goods traffic running       
 through the area.There is a good bus  
 service with frequent links to        
 Chesterfield,hourly buses to Sheffield
 and an adequate service to Staveley   
 where there are good links with other 
 services.
