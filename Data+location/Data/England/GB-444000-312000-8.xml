		<title>08Bardon Hill Quarry (cont)</title>
		<content>  Mr.Gregory Tom of Bardon Hill House  
 is the{Managing Director}of the Quarry
 His father bought the Quarry in 1947  
 from Ellis and Everard and Mr.Tom took
 over from his father. Mr.Tom's two    
 sons are also directors of the Quarry.
 Mr.Tom also owns much of the{farmland 
 around the Quarry, so he owns about   
 1000 acres altogether. The farmland is
 rented out to farmers.                
  Bardon Hill has lots of{customers}   
 both abroad and in this country.They  
 are mostly in the South of England    
 because there are no hard stone       
 quarries south of Bardon Hill. In 1964
 Bardon Hill Quarry developed a{special
{dust}for runways.This helps to prevent
 aeroplanes skidding in wet weather.   
 Also a specialist dust is made for    
 putting in floor emulsion and is sent 
 to France and Germany.
