		<content>{The Railway Through Hamworthy         
 The main line from{London Waterloo to 
{Weymouth}bisects the block passing    
 through{Hamworthy. }The route         
 traverses Poole Harbour and then      
 Lytchett Bay over the Rockley Viaduct.
 This line is very picturesque,often   
 passing over embankment flanked by    
 water on each side.  Many spectacular 
 views may be seen from the train.     
 A branch line,{Hamworthy}to{Wimbourne 
 was closed several years ago.  This   
 line is still in evidence by way of   
 embankments and cuttings. The         
 embankment is being dug up to fill    
 in some of Poole Harbour that is being
 reclaimed.                            
 Another branch line runs from         
{Hamworthy to Lower Hamworthy}but it   
 carries only goods to the industries  
 in Poole.
