		<title>02THE COASTGUARD STATION</title>
		<content> Walton has had a coastguard station in
 the town for over 100 years,its       
 present site is at the end of East    
 Terrace The new station was built     
 by the side of the old Lookout Station
 in the late 1970s and with the aid of 
 a wide range of sophisticated         
 equipment it covers  the busy stretch 
 of water from Aldeburgh to the Thames 
 including the harbours of Harwich,    
 Felixstowe and Ipswich as well as one 
 of the most popular yachting areas on 
 the coast.The signal that a ship is in
 distress is relayed to the volunteer  
 lifeboat crew by means of maroons,    
 signal flares that explode high in the
 sky.The crew then rush to the pier    
 leap onto their ex-G.P.O. bicycles and
 cycle to the end then row to where the
 lifeboat is moored.
