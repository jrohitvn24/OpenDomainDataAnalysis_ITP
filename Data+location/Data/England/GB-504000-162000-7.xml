		<content> THE AREA SINCE V.E. DAY               
   On V.E. Day 1945 there were lots of 
 street parties to celebrate the end of
 the War. However at that time most of 
 the land in this area was used for    
 farming and Byfleet and New Haw were  
 only small village-like communities.  
 There were only a few cars as most    
 people travelled by bicycle and public
 transport. The largest company was    
 Vickers Armstrong which has since     
 become B.A.E.  There was no library   
 and less variety of entertainment than
 now available.                        
     People alive then can remember    
 rationing of food, clothing and       
 petrol. However, most people who we   
 interviewed thought that although life
 had become easier and more            
 comfortable, the area was less        
 pleasant to live in because of        
 traffic, pollution and vandalism.     </content>
