 The Roman Fosse Way runs through the  
 south-east of our area.Our modern     
 roads are built on top of the old     
 Roman one but there is a part which is
 now buried beneath farmland.Romans    
 built straight roads with solid       
 foundations.They were paved and used  
 by soldiers for marching from one area
 to another.Many archaeoligists have   
 searched in our area along the route  
 of the Fosse Way and have found       
 remains of jars and coins.            
 There is evidence that there is       
 another Roman road running from west  
 to east in the north of our area,and  
 then on to the Roman "resort"at Bath. 
 There is a public footpath over the   
 old route which crosses Dutchy of     
 Cornwall land in our area.
