 A rectors job is to take services on  
 Sundays and to teach people.  Mr      
 Henley decided to be a rector because 
 God wanted him to do his work.  The   
 special names for his clothes are the 
 black robe he wears is called a       
 cassock.  The white thing he wears    
 over the top is called a surplice.    
 The white thing he wears around his   
 neck is a dog collar.  Only men can be
 a rector.  Mr Henley has been a rector
 for seven years.  Before he was a     
 rector he was working in a submarine.
