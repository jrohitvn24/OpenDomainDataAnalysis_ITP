		<title>02LOLWORTH, NEAR LONGSTANTON</title>
		<content>   Lolworth (population 130) is set on 
 a slight slope, overlooking the rest  
 of our D-Block. Although only a few   
 hundred metres from the A604, it seems
 very peaceful - no doubt because there
 is no through traffic. The village is 
 clustered around the green and the    
 church, the roads petering out in     
 farm buildings and fields of cereal   
 crops.                                
   Lolworth has some rather "grand"    
 houses- not all of them old. Indeed   
 two very spacious ones are being built
 now.From the green a lane leads to All
 Saints Church, a building dating from 
 1406. It has just had extensive       
 repairs and is freshly decorated. The 
 Longstanton Rector has taken over     
 responsibility for Lolworth this year.
   There are riding stables, a village 
 hall which was once the school,a      
 post-office but no shops.             </content>
