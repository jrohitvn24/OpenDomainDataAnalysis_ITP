		<content>  Adjoining the church is the Copford  
 Cricket{club}field and pavillion with 
 one of the{oldest Oak}trees still     
 standing defiantly on the side of the 
 pitch. This must be one of the most   
 beautiful settings in Essex for a     
 cricket ground.                       
  The green is the centre of the       
 village and the old original cottages 
 still surround it and are well        
 preserved. The Alma pub ia a friendly 
 meting place of the locals and runs a 
 successful social clubs.              
  The Green farm is still maintained   
 and run by the Folkard family who have
 been there for four generations.      
  One of the many pleasures in living  
 in Copford is the{easy access}to the  
 surrounding countryside by using one  
 of the many footpaths.Peace and       
 tranquility reigns in his lovely      
 corner of Essex.                      </content>
