		<title>14ALL SAINTS CHURCH DATCHWORTH</title>
		<content> This is the only active place of      
 worship in the village. There was a   
 Baptist Chapel but services ceased in 
 1970.                                 
 The Church stands on one of the {     
{highest points in the County.}It was  
 built by the Anglo-Saxons 810 years   
 ago. It stands inside a moat which can
 still be seen today. It is a simple   
 and dignified Church. It has a clock  
 tower with a spire and a belfry which 
 houses the six bells first hung in the
 17th Century.                         
 The Rector is also the Rector of St   
 Peter's in Tewin.Regular services are 
 held on Sundays and during the week.  
 There is a choir and a children's     
 Sunday School group.                  
 These two C of E churches are in the  
 Deanery of Stevenage, which like      
 Woolmer Green is in the Diocese of    
 St Albans.                            </content>
