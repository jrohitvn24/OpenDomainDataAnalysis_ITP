		<title>13SAWYER'S FARM LITTLE CORNARD</title>
		<content>                                       
Sawyer's Farm has 5 acres of land. The 
oldest part of it has been there since 
1320 and they had wings built on the   
house in the 16th Century.             
They have been growing herbs for 10    
years and wild flowers for 4 years and 
they grow vegetables.                  
The owners of the farm are Mr and Mrs  
Stevens. One of the rarest wildflowers 
is Corncockle.                         
Everything is done by hand. They grow  
plants in polytunnels as they are      
cheaper than glasstunnels. They called 
it Sawyer's Farm because there might   
have been a saw-pit there. The herbs   
they grow are to sell and they send    
herbs and flowers around the country.  
They are growing the flowers next to   
the motorways because all of the wild  
flowers are dying.
