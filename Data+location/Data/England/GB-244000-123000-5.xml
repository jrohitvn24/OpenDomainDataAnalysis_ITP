		<content>Both of the local Planning Authorities 
(Torridge and Torrington),are committed
to conservation,but some of their plans
,as those of higher bodies,may have    
unfavourable consequences for  this    
area.Increased recreational use of the 
Torridge,such as the approved policies 
of building a marina and providing in- 
creased mooring facilities lower down  
the river,bodes ill for the future.Even
if boats are excluded from the more    
sensitive parts of the estuary,their   
effluent will still have a deleterious 
effect there.Commercial fishermen were 
already encountering difficulties from 
water-skiing and power-boats, in 1979. 
A 5 acre tourist development at Ford   
House,in the midst of woodland regarded
as of special importance,poses another 
threat.New roads west and east of the  
area may bring more development,and    
even Jennett's is threatened obliquely.</content>
