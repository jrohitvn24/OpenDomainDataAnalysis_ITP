		<title>12NW.SHERBORNE:TUCKER'S CROSS</title>
		<content> The place where Kitton Lane, Hart's   
 Lane and Oatcroft Lane meet near the  
 top of Charlock Hill is known locally 
 as{Tucker's Cross.}It is said to have 
 this name because a man called Tucker,
 who had committed{suicide,}was buried 
 here. Suicides were not at one time   
 allowed to be buried in the           
 churchyard.{Crossroads}were also often
 places where criminals were hanged.   
 Nowadays there is an annual{          
{Horse-riders' Service}held here: all  
 the lanes which meet here are bridle  
 tracks. In one corner there is a dutch
 barn: the field diagonally opposite   
 the barn is used for growing{turf }   
 which is cut away from the hill by a  
 special machine and then taken away by
 truck to be sold. Water is pumped up  
 to the nearby fields by a{hydraulic   
{ram}in the valley below.
