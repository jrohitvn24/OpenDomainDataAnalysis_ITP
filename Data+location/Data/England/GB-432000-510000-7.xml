		<content>   St. Laurence at Middleton-One-Row   
 was                                   
 built in 1870/1 as a Chapel of Ease to
 the ancient Parish Church of St.      
 George, due to the movement of village
 development. Both churches are under  
 the care of the same Vicar.           
  Three services are celebrated each   
 Sunday and one evensong each month at 
 St. George. The approximate collective
 congregation each Sunday is between 60
 and 100. The Electoral Roll in 1985 is
 126.                                  
  The Methodist Chapel built in 1856 is
 closing after the Harvest Festival    
 service on Sunday, October 13th 1985  
 due to falling congregations. The     
 congregation will attend services at  
 Middleton St.George.
