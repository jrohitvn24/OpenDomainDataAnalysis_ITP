		<content> I get up at 7.30am.By 8.30,I unlock,  
 switch off the burglar alarm,check the
 bookings that have come in the morning
 post with the Bookings Diary,and      
 quickly write out the replies.Peter   
 the chef arrives just after 9am,and   
 between us we put together the food   
 orders and discuss menus required by  
 different parties that have written   
 requesting them.During the early part 
 of the morning I restock the wine     
 racks and the bar,boxing up all the   
 empty bottles that are charged for    
 return.On the busy days,the telephone 
 can ring 30-40 times during the       
 morning with bookings for tables of   
 2-22.The staff arrive from 10.30am.   
 Apart from the chef,there is one      
 full-time assistant chef and two      
 part-time students.In the restaurant, 
 there are two full-time waiters and   
 three part-time waitresses(cont.p5)   </content>
