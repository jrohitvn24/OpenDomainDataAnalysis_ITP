 with breakfast eaten in the kitchen.  
 Father probably leaves first. Mother  
 takes the younger ones to school,     
 walking or in the family car, older   
 ones take the school bus.

 herself with housekeeping &amp; voluntary 
 work. Household aids are electric     
 cookers, deep freezers, refrigerators,
 washing machines, vacuum cleaners &amp;   
 some food processors, dish washers &amp;  
 microwave ovens.                      
{Afternoons}Nursery children come home 
 for lunch.Village school closes at 3pm
 &amp; older ones return later.Children    
 have tea - their main meal. Older ones
 then do homework &amp; adults eat later.

 television &amp; radio/record players,some
 video recorders. An older school-girl 
 will babysit if the adults go out.    </content>
