		<content> The Birmingham - Warwick Canal, now   
part of The Grand Union Canal,was built
in the 1820's and is mainly used by    
leisure barges.                        
 There is a railway link to Moor Street
Station through Olton and Acocks Green 
Stations. During the day there is a    
diesel train every 30 minutes with more
frequent trains in the rush hour peaks.
The adult fare is 65p return to the    
city. Children under 14 travel half    
fare and pensioners with passes go free
 The buses link up with the trains as  
both services are co-ordinated by the  
West Midlands P.T.E. Buses into        
Birmingham on the two main roads, the  
Coventry and Warwick Roads, are every  
15 minutes during the day, at least.   
Several other buses connect up these   
roads.The two main roads connect the   
area with the M42 and the National     
Exhibition Centre.                     </content>
