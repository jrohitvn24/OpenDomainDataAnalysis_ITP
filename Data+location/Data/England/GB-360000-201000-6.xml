		<content>    Shopping in Lydney is a normally   
 quiet and unhurried activity. It comes
 to life on week-ends with grocery     
 buying and the open-air market        
 bringing in crowds from outside areas.
    Most groceries are bought from the 
 three supermarkets. The small grocery 
 shops get their sales from mid-week   
 buying and casual purchases such as   
 sweets and cigarettes.                
    Do it Yourself materials,clothes,  
 furniture and electrical and audio-   
 visual goods are all available though 
 some mums buy these in Gloucester for 
 greater choice and competitive prices.
    Most shops are on the long, main   
 street. In recent years some shops and
 banks from the top end of the town    
 have moved to the bottom end. This is 
 controversial as is the move to close 
 the main post office leaving only a   
 counter service in a newsagent's shop.</content>
