		<content> The main road from Colchester to Cam- 
 bridge ran straight through Abington. 
 A thousand cars per hour and a lorry  
 crashing into the school playground   
 led to the construction of a bypass.  
 Abington is now a peaceful village, to
 bike to school or the shops. Walking  
 is also common in the village and     
 there are many walks through the surr-
 ounding fields. There is a daily      
 school bus for children living in the 
 area to Gt.Abington primary school and
 Linton Village College. The villagers 
 are served by a bus service connecting
 Cambridge &amp; Haverhill. We conducted a 
 survey and found that people have l.5 
 cars per family and 3.2 bicycles. The 
 old railway ran from Cambridge to     
 Haverhill. It ran through Abington. It
 was opened in 1865 and closed in 1967.
 Pampisford station was the nearest    
 station, just outside Abington.       </content>
