		<title>05 SUPERNATURAL LOCAL LEGENDS</title>
		<content>  There are countless tales of witches 
and ghosts around lancashire.One of our
churches,St.Mary's,which is several    
centuries old,is said to have a buried 
witch.Over the grave is an iron cage to
prevent its spirit escaping.           
  Another story about a local building,
not far from our school,is about the   
Penwortham Hall Maid.One night a local 
man was met by a girl after getting off
a bus.They started talking together,and
she accompanied him home.As he turned  
to say"Thank you",and bid her good     
night,she vanished.He was astonished   
and wanted to find out about this      
ghostly meeting.After much             
investigation,he discovered that a maid
from Penwortham Hall had died there    
long ago.From then on,he has claimed to
have witnessed the return of the       
Penwortham Hall Maid.
