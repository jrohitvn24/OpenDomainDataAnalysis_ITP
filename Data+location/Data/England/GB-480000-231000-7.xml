		<title>07  Building</title>
		<content>     Building is a completely different
 process now. It is done in such a way 
that the amount of things used, i. e.  
bricks and cement are measured to a    
perfect standard. The structure is a   
very important part.This is designed   
by an architect who tests whether or   
 not it will work.  He puts it into a  
computer which works out the dimensions
of it,then says if it is going to stand
up ,or be a disaster.                  
     Some builders have to make ascale 
model of the building. this is to show 
where things will go and if they will  
be hazard to people or not.            
     Houses have to be built in such a 
way that they are comfortable for the  
people to live in.Rooms must be        
arranged in such a way so as to be     
convenient to the owner.
