		<content>  The D- block which we chose as our   
 survey area is situated in the heart  
 of the Leicestershire Countryside. It 
 lies about 7 miles to the North East  
 of Leicester. This rural area,        
 consisting mainly of grazing for      
 cattle and various forms of arable    
 farming, is dotted with small         
 villages. These are called South      
 Croxton, Barsby and Ashby Folville.   
 These villages were histonically      
 thriving farming communities with     
 local amenities such as butchers and  
 bakers, and were inhabited with people
 who worked in the village or on the   
 local farmland. Barsby for instance,  
 was a prospening cheese producing     
 village. Since local employment and   
 amenities have declined and most      
 residents in the villages are either  
 retired or commute to work in         
 Leicester or Melton.                  </content>
