		<content>   Each morning, the gamekeeper who    
 lives on the deer park,looks after the
 pheasants and feeds them and puts nets
 on them.He then collects the pheasants
 eggs and puts them in the incubator to
 hatch out.They are then put in night  
 pens. In July the grown pheasants are 
 moved to the wood.                    
   The gamekeeper checks every day to  
 see that none of the deer in the park 
 get out.If any deer stray near the    
 raspberry bushes, the keeper has to   
 drive them away.Old deer are shot at  
 a certain age when they are no longer 
 suitable for venison or breeding.     
   The gamekeeper also checks to see   
 there are no poachers of the deer.He  
 checks that no vermin or crows get to 
 the corn crops,or steal eggs,and he   
 shoots any culprits he finds.
