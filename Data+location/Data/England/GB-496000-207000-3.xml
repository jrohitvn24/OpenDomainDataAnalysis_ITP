The valley has been an important route-
way for at least 2000 years.The A41 is 
a road link between London and Holyhead
. Commuter and heavy goods traffic     
exert a great deal of pressure on this 
narrow road between 0700hrs and        
1900hrs. The road is equally busy at   
the weekend with day trippers visiting 
the countryside. There are bus links   
between Berkhamsted, London, Watford,  
Hemel Hempstead, Windsor, Tring and    
Aylesbury. HGV traffic is both national
and international.                     
A high amount of passenger and freight 
rail traffic travels through the valley
between destinations such as London,   
Birmingham and Glasgow. The line is    
electrified and the latest APT units   
are used for long distance work and    
DMU are used for commuters to London.  </content>
