		<title>19ALL SAINTS' CHURCH</title>
		<content>  There has been a church on the pres- 
ent site since the 12th Century. The   
present church, formerly St Leonard's, 
is built of local red sandstone. It is 
quite a large parish church, incorpor- 
ating a Lady Chapel.                   
  The window behind the font is of     
interest as it was designed by the Vic-
torian artist Burne-Jones. On the other
side of the tower is a window commemor-
ating Izaac Walton, a close friend of  
Sir John Offley, benefactor of Madeley 
and Lord of the Manor.                 
  On the floor of the Lady Chapel is a 
brass of good quality depicting members
of the Egerton family. The pulpit is   
one of very few with a design by Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti.                      
  The bells of Madeley Church are still
rung several times a week by a group of
devoted bell-ringers.
