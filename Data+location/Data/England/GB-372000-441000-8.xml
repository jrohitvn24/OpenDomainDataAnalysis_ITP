		<title>08A CLITHEROE BUS INSPECTOR</title>
		<content>    We asked a bus inspector at the    
 Clitheroe Ribble Bus Depot when the   
 last bus came in and where it came    
 from. It came from Manchester and     
 arrived back at the depot at twelve   
 thirty a.m.                           
    We also asked who supplied the     
 advertisements. He said that for the  
 inside of the bus they had their own  
 adverts about trips, holidays,        
 commuter bus tickets and other        
 different kinds of bus tickets. On the
 outside the adverts came from         
 manufactures who worked locally. The  
 adverts on the outside of the bus cost
 Â£2.00 a day.                          
    The buses travel to Manchester,    
 Preston and Blackburn depots. These   
 are the three main places. While      
 'Betty's Bus' does a route via        
 Clitheroe, Downham, Waddington and    
 other small isolated villages.        </content>
