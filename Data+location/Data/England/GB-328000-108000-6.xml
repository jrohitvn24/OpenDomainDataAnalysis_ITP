		<content> Many of the former farm houses and    
 cottages in the rural area have been  
 sold and fewer people living in this  
 part of the block are now employed in 
 agriculture.There is a small council  
 housing development dating from {1947 
 at{Bondfield Way}and named after      
 Margaret Bondfield the first lady     
 Cabinet Minister who was born and     
 raised in Chard.Several terraces of   
 small houses follow the line of Combe 
 St which is itself on the old spring  
 line.There is extensive private       
 individual development of the Western 
 slopes of Snowdon Hill.               
 Recently there has been pressure on   
 marginal farm land to N. of the town  
 for estate development there and plans
 for more housing between{Glynswood}and
{Bews Lane.}The{Sunnymead}complex was  
 built by Yeovil D.C.to provide full   
 time care for the  elderly.           </content>
