		<title>09Shopping and parks in Camden</title>
		<content> Camden Town is exellent for shopping  
for clothes, shoes and food. As well as
being buisy with shops there are parks.
They are great and fun. They have      
playgrounds and if it rains you could  
always go to the zoo. To keep you      
amused at bonfire night you can see    
firerworks and get food. Primrose Hill 
is the main in Camden so is Regents    
Park, in Regents Park there is an open 
air theater. Parks are fun, especially 
these two. All together Camden Town is 
a very exiting place to visit.
