		<title>13THE CITADEL</title>
		<content>    This{fortification}was built in the
 1660s and is not only one of          
 Plymouth's most historic{buildings}but
 also one of the finest remaining 17C  
 forts in the country.                 
    From its position on the eastern   
 end of the Hoe,it could easily defend 
 the entrance to the Cattewater and    
 Sutton Pool,then the major berthing   
 areas of the King's Navy.Its{ramparts 
 are 70ft. thick and in places 60      
 ft. high.Although if never enjoyed    
 active fighting,it did have 165       
 guns.Those that remain ,mostly 19C are
 ornamental.                           
    Since the turn of the century the  
 Citadel has been the home of the{Royal
{Artillery,}and the 29 Commando unit   
  now inhabits its imposing buildings  
 which include the extremely pretty    
{St.Catherine's chapel,}which is open  
 to the publi.                         </content>
