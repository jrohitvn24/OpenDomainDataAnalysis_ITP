 with another school.The information   
 gathered here is of the six squares in
 the eastern half of the block.        
    The six sq.km contain the village  
 of Blackwell and Burcot and part of   
 the village of Finstall,all in the    
 Bromsgrove District,Worcestershire.   
    The area is predominately a farming
 one,with some housing,mainly of the   
 larger type.The main Birmingham to    
 Burcot railway line runs through and  
 contained within the block is the     
 Lickey Incline said to be the steepest
 railway slope in England.             
    In addition to a private golf      
 course are two sites owned by the     
 scouting movement,one for camping and 
 one for water sports.
