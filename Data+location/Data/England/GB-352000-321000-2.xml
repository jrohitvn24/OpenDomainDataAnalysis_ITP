 is in our area is called{Castle Farm. 
 It is tenanted by{Roger Pinches.      
 The owner is{Sir John Corbett.}       
      There are{464 acres}of land and  
 he has three people working for       
 him.The machinery he owns includes 5  
 tractors,1 corndrill,1 plough,1 slurry
 tanker and a few trailers.All the     
 large machinery, like combine         
 harvesters he borrows from his brother
 who is an agricultural machinery      
 contractor.                           
      The farm is a mixed farm but they
 mainly specialise in rearing{pigs.}The
 pigs are  born there and they rear    
 them until they are six months old and
 then they go to the market and are    
 killed.They grow wheat and feed half  
 of it to the pigs but they have to buy
 some of the food like fat and protein 
 to add to the wheat.                  </content>
