		<title>10ST.GEORGE'S CHURCH,BRAILES.</title>
		<content> Our magnificent Parish Church is      
 known as the{Cathedral of the Feldon- 
 the field land of South Warwickshire. 
 The tower, 110 feet high, is a local  
 landmark.Most of the present building 
 is 14th Century though the first Vicar
 was instituted in 1153 and there was  
 certainly a Saxon church on the site  
 before that.                          
                                       
                                       
   Children's Impressions:-            
                                       
   One of the lovely stained glass     
 windows is called the "Children's     
 Window"and is devoted to 37 children  
 who died of diptheria in 1876.The font
 is 600 years old and has eight sides, 
 each with a different pattern carved  
 in stone.The great Organ has hundreds 
 of pipes in it and was built when the 
 church was restored in 1879.          </content>
