		<title>09INFORMATION OFFICER,AYSGARTH</title>
		<content> Our Yorkshire Dales National Park     
 Information Officer works in the      
 Information Centre at Aysgarth        
 answering people's questions. To get  
 his job he had to have a thorough     
 knowledge of Wensleydale. In a day    
 between 50 and 1500 people can visit  
 the Centre. More people come in school
 holidays. People want to know         
 directions to places of interest, eg  
 Bolton Castle, and local waterfalls   
 and footpaths. He said there are      
 sometimes troublemakers who do things 
 like letting dogs run loose, picking  
 flowers and digging up plants growing 
 in the woods, breaking down fences and
 stiles and turning signs round. He    
 enjoys his job because he meets       
 interesting people and he is glad to  
 help them to appreciate and enjoy this
 lovely part of England.
