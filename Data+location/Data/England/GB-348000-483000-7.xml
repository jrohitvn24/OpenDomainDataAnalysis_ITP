		<content> comes.                                
                                       
 The farm has l50 sheep, two ponies,   
 three sheep dogs and 3 cats.  Mr. and 
 Mrs. Handly rent 275 acres which is   
 mostly grazing land.  Down near the   
 estuary it is fertile soil so they    
 plant crops of potatoes, barley and   
 silage.  The fields on Heversham Head 
 are good for sheep grazing.  It is not
 good for crops because there is not   
 sufficient depth of soil.             
                                       
 The farmhouse has still the Great Hall
 which is the coldest part of the      
 house.  In the l7th century beams were
 put across to make an upper floor.    
 The farmhouse once had two pele       
 towers, but these have fallen down.   
 Many extentions have been made over   
 the years to the farmhouse.
