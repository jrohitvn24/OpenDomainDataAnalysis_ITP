 Holdings vary from a few acres to     
 many hundred. Fields large with few   
 hedges.   Acreages have been          
 increased by acquisition of           
 neighbouring vacant land and          
 amalgamation of tenancies. Most       
 farms are owner occupied. There are   
 some Council and private tenancies    
 and one large farming company.        
 Arable farming predominates, but      
 there are intensive pig and poultry   
 units.                                
 Crops: wheat-milling compounding.     
 Barley-malting. Sugar beet,           
 potatoes,peas, broad &amp; dwarf beans    
 under contract for freezing,          
 etc.rape, sheep on stubble conifers.  
 All work is mechanised, app. l man per
 200 acres. All farms have grain       
 storage facilities, etc. Straw        
 either burnt baled or ploughed in.    </content>
