		<title>20Bleak House</title>
		<content>    Leaving{Great Links Tor,}one soon  
 comes to the two{Dunnagoats.}These    
 are two twinned hills, both crowned   
 with rocks, though not steep or       
 imposing.                             
    Looking down from the top of the   
 tors one is immediately struck by     
 one of the lonliest sight on the moor.
 Across on the far bank of the         
 Rattlebrook are the remains of{Bleak  
{House,}once the summit of someones    
 dreams.                               
    Erected in the last century as     
 part of some peat workings higher up  
 the Rattlebrook it only worked for a  
 few years.                            
    It is axiomatic that Dartmoor is a 
 hard taskmaster, and the broken walls 
 of the house echo the broken dreams   
 that this harsh landscape brings      
 about. In the bright sun, the house   
 invites one; but see it in winter!    </content>
