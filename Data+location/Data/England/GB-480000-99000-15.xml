		<title>15Birdham - Chichester Canal</title>
		<content> Part of the Portsmouth and Arun Canal 
 runs through the parish of Birdham.   
 The canal was opened in 1823. It ran  
 from Portsmouth through the Chichester
 harbour to Birdham and then to the    
 Arun. It was possible to travel then  
 on to London. A branch of the canal   
 went up to Chichester. The canal was  
 finally abandoned in 1928.            
 The  seaward end of the canal is at   
 Salterns Lock, a working lock which is
 in need of repair. The remains of     
 another lock, Casher Lock, can still  
 be seen but this is now a solid       
 concrete weir. There is one swing     
 bridge which still operates the       
 Egremont Bridge. This section of the  
 old canal is now used for mooring     
 houseboats. Some of these boats move  
 out into the harbour for the summer   
 months.
