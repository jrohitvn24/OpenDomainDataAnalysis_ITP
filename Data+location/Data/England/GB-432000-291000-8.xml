		<title>08Nuneaton Common</title>
		<content>  The Common situated off{Bucks Hill}is
 reached by a footpath which runs      
 alongside a large cemetery. A disused 
 railway embankment provides a useful  
 way of crossing the Common though it  
 is somewhat overgrown with small{oak  
{trees}and{elder.}There are signs of   
 horseriding and dog exercising along  
 this path. Some large grassed areas   
 provide suitable sites for picnics.   
  There is no development for sporting 
 use or other leisure activities. Areas
 which are little used are reverting   
 back to natural form with a           
 multiplicity of wild flowers.         
  Bordering the Common near{Plough Hill
 is a concrete works with an enormous  
 tip at its edge. Housing surrounding  
 the Common often carried dates, most  
 being built in the late 19th century  
 with occasional infilling of small    
 private estates.                      </content>
