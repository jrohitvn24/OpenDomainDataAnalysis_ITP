		<title>15RIBBESFORD WOOD,nr Stourport</title>
		<content> Ribbesford Wood is one mile south of  
 Bewdley.In the wood there are about   
 330,000 trees most of which are       
 oak.They have recently planted a lot  
 of Corsician pine.About 125 years ago 
 a house was built in the wood called  
 Ribbesford Hall.This has now been     
 demolished and turned into flats for  
 the old people.There are many animals 
 in the wood :-foxes ,badgers ,stoats  
 ,weasels and grey squirrels,but there 
 are no deer.                          
  On the Victorian O.S. map there are  
 names such as Church Hill Wood,Walkham
 Wood ,Trundalls Wood and Castle Hill  
  Wood,but on a new map these names    
 do not appear and they are not used   
 now, except for one name which is     
 still used and that is Botany Bay     
 Coppice. Part of the woods are in the 
 district of Heightington.
