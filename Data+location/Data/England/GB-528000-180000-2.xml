		<content> London Nautical Secondary School is   
 located in sq km 05310180 which       
 includes Blackfriars Station and      
 Bridge in the north, a power station  
 to the east and the National Theatre  
 to the west. The primary land cover in
 this sq km is commercial, consisting  
 of private offices, many of which are 
 new, high-rise developments, employing
 1000s of people.  A substantial part  
 of the square is being re-developed.  
 This mainly involves demolishing old  
 offices and warehouses and erecting   
 new offices, car parking space and    
 some council housing.  The Coin Street
 re-development scheme, near to the    
 London Nautical School, is a current  
 example.  The River Thames takes up a 
 large amount of space in our sq km and
 so is considered to be a secondary    
 land cover.                           
                                       </content>
