		<title>07WADES FARM, ADELAIDE (ii)</title>
		<content> In winter,the land has to be drained  
 and dykes carry the excess water into 
 the River Lark.In summer,the crops    
 have to be irrigated using large      
 booms which move across the fields.   
 To prevent disease and pests,the crops
 are sprayed during the growing season.
 When the land was divided between four
 farmers, one hundred people worked on 
 it but now there are only six full-ti 
 me tractor drivers.Seasonal labour    
 includes fourteen women planting      
 celery,twenty-five on potato planting 
 and two students.The hours are Summer 
 7am to 6pm and Winter 7.30am to       
 4pm.The workers are paid              
 approximately Â£3.16 an hour,about Â£161
 a week.In years to come,Greens Farms  
 will supply a large percentage of     
 Britain's vegetables.Wades Farm       
 modifies machinery  to suit its       
 conditions.                           </content>
