		<content>  Wybunbury today is no longer a       
 village of older citizens.An influx of
 younger people has meant that the     
 average age of the population has been
 reduced.The arrival of the new        
 inhabitants has also meant that the   
 community is no longer as closely knit
 as it once was.Recent housing         
 developments are in no small part     
 responsible for this surge back to the
 country.                              
                                       
  People in the upper wage bracket and 
 self employed business men have also  
 been moving into the area, living in  
 renovated, modernised farm houses.    
                                       
  In general the population of         
 Wybunbury can be defined as           
 essentially middle-class.
