 Schools in Longfield operate on the   
 three tier_system. Children at five go
 to either Woodview First School or    
 Sedley's,Southfleet (according to     
 where they live) until they are nine. 
 At nine they transfer to Longfield    
 Middle School,where they remain until 
 thirteen,unless they gain a place at  
 11+ in one of the Dartford grammar    
 schools. At thirteen children move on 
 either to Longfield Upper School or to
 the Gravesend grammar schools. They   
 remain there until either sixteen or  
 eighteen years of age.                
 The buildings date from the 1960s,with
 some additional building erected      
 during the 1980s.
