		<title>18FARMS IN SOUTH MOOR</title>
		<content> We visited 3 farms from the 5 in our  
 area.We found out that all the farmers
 were {tenants}of the{National Coal    
{Board.}Land is of poor quality; clay  
 over coal.Called "Mixed",they are     
 mainly{Livestock}farms.               
 Shortly after visiting Mr.Oxley of    
 Stanley Burn Farm,he died.Andrea Pigg,
 who goes to our school,lives on Morrow
 Edge Farm,which is going to be        
 demolished because the N.C.B.want the 
 land to open-cast for coal.We think it
 is a shame!                           
 We saw a special herd of pedigree     
 Limousin cows and 3 bulls at Mr.      
 Barron's New Acres Farm.              
 All the farmers work long hours and   
 never have a holiday,but they enjoy   
 their job.We would not like to work so
 hard.
