		<title>12ASHDOWN FOREST FOR STUDY</title>
		<content> Students of all ages from school chil-
 dren to serious archeologists come to 
 learn about the Forest. On private    
 land in the North West corner of our  
 block there were recently important   
 excavations revealing the site of an  
 Iron Age Fort and a Roman Villa.      
 Afterwards the top-soil was replaced  
 until further work could be done. The 
 London-Lewes Roman Road ran close to  
 the present B2026 and a small grass-  
 covered raised section of it has now  
 been marked and described on a plaque.
 There have been excavations showing   
 that iron was produced here from Roman
 times until the 17th century. It is   
 hard to imagine the Forest as an      
 industrial region but the use of wood 
 for charcoal is the reason for its    
 present relatively treeless condition.
 An orientation table was erected to   
 commemorate the Silver Jubilee in 1977</content>
