		<content> Within the inclosures in this area can
 be found various types of conifers or 
 softwood trees. These are{Douglas Fir,
{Corsican Pine, Scots Pine, Larch,     
{Sitka and Norway Spruce.}After        
 planting, these trees grow to 25 years
 of age and are then thinned on a 5    
 year cycle up to approximately 50     
 years. From 50 to 80 years is the     
 optimum time for felling. After this  
 the growth rate decreases. 80% of the 
 stock is felled and the remaining 20% 
 is left growing in a scattered        
 pattern. Each group to be felled      
 covers a subcompartment, which in the 
 New Forest is just over a hectare.    
 These areas are replanted with        
 softwood or hardwood trees. There are 
 experiments with{natural regeneration 
 where the area underneath existing    
 trees is reseeded so these are growing
 when the large trees are felled.{Cont></content>
