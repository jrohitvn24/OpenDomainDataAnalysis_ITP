 This fruit farm is situated approx.   
 at map ref.87,34 and 88,35. It is     
 owned by a Trust in Leicester which   
 provides flatlet accommodation for    
 elderly citizens of the town. The 800 
 acres are mainly arable. Crops are    
 grains,potatoes,sugar beet,peas(sold  
 as frozen),strawberries,raspberries   
 and gooseberries. There is a herd of  
 Charolais cattle. The soft fruit side 
 is  partly 'pick your own' and partly 
 picked for the trade. The prolonged   
 frost in l984/5 winter and the        
 extensive rain in May 1985, causing   
 the lower fields near canal to flood, 
 have damaged soft fruit crops. Picking
 season lasts about 5 weeks. The season
 this year is late because the first   
 flowers were killed by frost and wet.
