 HOUSING                               
 Most of the housing within our area is
 scattered and relates fairly closely  
 to the farming layout, a large        
 percentage of the dwellings are or    
 have been farmhouses or tied          
 agricultural cottages.  Many of them  
 have been built from sandstone        
 quarried from very small quarries of  
 which there are about twenty all      
 disused.  One row of houses has no    
 service road to it, it appears to be  
 built on the boundary of an old       
 common.  Within our part of the       
 village there are fifty eight         
 dwellings with a population of one    
 hundred and forty seven.  The majority
 of these houses are red brick built.  
 There is a small council estate, the  
 rest appear to be privately owned.
