		<title>18CUNSWICK HALL FARM</title>
		<content>  Previously run by the Monks,{Cunswick
{Hall}was inhabited by the{Leyburnes   
 between 1216-1737, and they           
 represented Westmorland in Parliament 
 and also fought for the king. Cunswick
 is supposedly{haunted}by the ghost of 
{Roger de Leyburne,}who stabbed his    
 father in order to inherit the hall.  
 After the body was found, Roger was   
 forced to confess, and he himself was 
 later found stabbed.{Henry VIII}is    
 said to have stayed at the hall while 
 courting{Katherine Parr.}Very little  
 remains of the orginal Hall, now a    
 farmhouse. The old window containing  
{the first glass in Westmorland        
 remains, as do the yew trees planted  
 during Tudor times. The{pele tower}was
 destroyed after James Leyburne gave   
 the bell and clock to Kendal(1582),   
 but the royal arms engraved in stone  
 still remain over the archway.        </content>
