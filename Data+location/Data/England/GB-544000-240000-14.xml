 People live in this rural area because
 they enjoy peace and quiet, friend-   
 liness.  This area is rural but has   
 good communications - road and rail   
 links.  They prefer to bring up their 
 children in the country.  Most people 
 are very contented living in the area.
{BAD POINTS                            
 Some rural homes have unreliable      
 electricity and during winter a few   
 isolated houses can be cut off from   
 main roads and services.  There is no 
 village shop and very little public   
 transport for school leavers into     
 towns.  Only 3 buses per day to       
 Cambridge.  There are no recreational 
 facilities for teenagers.  Noise of   
 farm machinery at anti-social hours is
 sometimes annoying.
