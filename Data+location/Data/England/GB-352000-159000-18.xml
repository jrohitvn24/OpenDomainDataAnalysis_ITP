		<title>18Nempnett Thrubwell Church</title>
		<content> Though so sparsely inhabited, there   
 are 2 churches and a chapel in this   
 area. With the decline of relgious    
 observance, many interesting and      
 beautiful churches are seldom used    
 and, sadly, this is the case in       
 Nempnett Thrubwell. The parish has    
 been combined with those of Chew Stoke
 and Norton Malreward, the church of   
 the largest village (Chew Stoke) being
 the dominant one, though services are 
 still held at Nempnett. This 13th     
 century church has a Norman font      
 surronded by eighteen little men      
 pulling comical faces and hanging     
 above is the 400yr old oak cover which
 once locked into place against the    
 interference of witches. Robert, the  
 first rector of St. Mary's, is buried 
 at the foot of the old cross in the   
 churchyard. Every subsequent rector's 
 name is recorded in the vestry.       </content>
