		<title>13School to Community Centre</title>
		<content>    Nine years ago when Lydney County  
 Junior and Infant Schools moved to new
 premises the old building became a    
 Community Centre. Rooms were enlarged 
 by removal of dividing walls and      
 facilities such as a coffee bar added,
 young people helping with some jobs.  
    The Centre has grown steadily and  
 now hosts a large number of activities
 and organisations covering all ages.  
 For the very young there is a five day
 a week playgroup, the more elderly an 
 Over 60 Club. Youth organisations     
 meeting there are Guides, Cubs and a  
 Youth Club. Sporting activities       
 include Judo, Boxing and Weight       
 Lifting. Evening classes cater for    
 typing, sewing and weight watchers.   
    The Youth Training Scheme, Citizens
 Advice BUreau, a mentally handicapped 
 club and others are all catered for by
 a warden and part time youth leaders. </content>
