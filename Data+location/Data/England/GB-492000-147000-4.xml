		<title>04PUTTENHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content> Puttenham has a very interesting      
 church. The window commemorating the  
 patron saint,{John the Baptist,}is now
 hidden behind the organ. Several years
 ago this was moved from its former    
 place in the chancel to help the sound
 to reach the congregation. There is   
 a brass memorial to{Edward Cranford,  
 rector in 1400, wearing his vestments.
 Close by is a window with a lower     
 light said to be a beggar's window.   
 The kneelers were made by the women of
 the village about ten years ago. They 
 are all different but made in the same
 colours. There are Jubilee pictures   
 and sculptures given by local artists.
 In the church yard is a{well,         
 discovered in 1972 when a tree        
 disappeared from sight on Palm Sunday.
 It was used in 1735 to put out a fire 
 which destroyed the church tower after
 spreading from the blacksmith's shop. </content>
