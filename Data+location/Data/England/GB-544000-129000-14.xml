		<title>14ASHDOWN FOREST CONSERVATION</title>
		<content> The safety and welfare of Ashdown     
 Forest are in the care of the 16      
 strong Board of Conservators, ll      
 elected members and 5 Commoners. There
 are 650 registered Commoners but only 
 a few use their rights to graze. One  
 member of the Board represents the    
 Lord of the Manor, 8 from the East    
 Sussex County Council and 2 from the  
 Wealden District Council. There is a  
 Forest Superintendent with 4 full-time
 Rangers. There are 2 permanent workmen
 and some 16 employed under the        
 Manpower Services Commission, several 
 voluntary Rangers and Information     
 Staff. The Friends of Ashdown Forest  
 and the Commoners lend their whole-   
 hearted support to the Board. All are 
 very active and totally dedicated to  
 the preservation of this supremely    
 beautiful and historic area of East   
 Sussex.                               </content>
