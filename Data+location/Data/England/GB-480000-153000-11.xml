		<title>11CONTINENTAL DAY FOR FLEET ?</title>
		<content> Up to July 1985,{Courtmoor School}had 
 a timetable lasting from 8.45am to    
 3.40pm, similar to most other schools.
                                       
 In September, 1985, Courtmoor is      
 introducing a{"continental" type day.}
                                       
 Pupils will register at 8.30am.       
 Following assembly, the first two     
 lessons will be divided by a 5 minutes
 "changeover" time and pupils will not 
 have a proper break until 11.10. This 
 will last 20 mins and snacks will be  
 on sale. A similar break will follow  
 the third lesson at 12.50 and the     
 school day will end at 2.20pm, when   
 meals will be available. It is hoped  
 that the earlier finish to the day    
 will allow more activities to take    
 place after school, whilst allowing   
 pupils and teachers more time with    
 their own families.                   </content>
