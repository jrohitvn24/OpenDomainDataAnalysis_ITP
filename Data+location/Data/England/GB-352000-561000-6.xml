		<content>  I get up at 8.20,I put my clothes on 
 and get washed and have my breakfast. 
 Then I get into the car and go to     
 school. I arrive at school at 8.45 and
 have a quick game of chess. Then at   
 9.00 the teacher comes and takes the  
 register. Then we have assembly. When 
 we get back at half past nine, we have
 maths until break time at 10.30. At   
 10.45 we have English until 12.00 and 
 then we have a lunch break until 1.00.
 At one o'clock we have reading for    
 half an hour then at about 1.35 we    
 watch a geography programme on T.V. We
 have a break at 2.15 until 2.30. After
 break we have P.E. until 3.00. At 3.00
 we have story or art. The order of the
 lessons changes every day. At 3.30 my 
 mother picks me up in the car and we  
 go home.
