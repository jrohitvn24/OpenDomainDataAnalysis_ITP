		<title>15CHANGES IN LEYBURN</title>
		<content> I interviewed a lady who has lived in 
 Leyburn for 36 years - since she was  
 born.She has lived in her present     
 home, a bungalow, for eight and a half
 years but has lived in a few other    
 houses in the town during her life.   
 Having been educated in Leyburn she   
 worked locally. When she married she  
 remained in the town as her husband   
 was employed locally.                 
 One of the main regrets felt is the   
 closure of the local cinemas of which 
 there were two. The Comprehensive     
 School which was built to accommodate 
 pupils form the age of eleven upwards 
 from the whole dale is looked upon as 
 an improvement to the former system of
 village schools which educated        
 children from the age of five up to   
 leaving school at sixteen.
