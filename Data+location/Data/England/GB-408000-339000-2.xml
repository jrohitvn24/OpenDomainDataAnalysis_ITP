and began as a small fort on the site  
of the church.An Augustinian.Abbey     
built in 1146,is marked by an open area
known as Abbey Fields,they and the     
Roman settlement area are listed as an 
ancient monument.A Roman dig is being  
carried out by archaeologists sifting  
the earth to find more remains telling 
us about the past of Rocester.They are 
to be placed in an old church building 
which will become a museum.In 1781-2   
Richard Arkwright, pioneer of water    
powered machinery built a mill at the  
east end of the village.It is a brick  
building still in use today.On the side
of the shops there's a mural of a Roman
Legionary Standard,a crowned letter M  
and weaver's shuttle to show Rocester's
early origins.                         </content>
