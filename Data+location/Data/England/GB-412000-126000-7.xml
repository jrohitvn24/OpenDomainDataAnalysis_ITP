		<content> The unit has 48 beds,each designed to 
 give the patients spine the maximum   
 support possible. This unit is not    
 very exspensive to maintain. Treatment
 of the patients includes _{           
{EURODYNAMICS}=Exploring how badly     
 patients nerves are damaged. This     
 equipment costs about Â£60,000. They   
 also stimulate muscles,to move by     
 artificial electronuc signals that    
 mimic real ones sent before the nerves
 were damaged. The people accepted for 
 this treatment come from as far away  
 as Cornwall,along the coast to        
 Portsmouth,and up to Swindon &amp; parts  
 of South Wales(A few patients are     
 accepted from Stoke Mandeville).      
 Advances probable in the future are   
 improvements in muscle stimulation,   
 involving techniques that may enable  
 some to walk again.35 skilled people  
 work there.                           </content>
