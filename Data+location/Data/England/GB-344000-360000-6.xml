		<content> On the Grosvenor Estate,east of       
 Saighton &amp; on Hattonheath farm,some   
 very large fields have been created by
 the removal of hedges to create a     
 "Prairie-type" landscape.These are now
 used for the large-scale,mechanised,  
 cultivation of cereals,brought about  
 by the European Economic Community    
 reducing the milk production allowed, 
 so less grassland is needed for fewer 
 cattle (the Estate overall now has 1  
 less herd).Moveable electric fences   
 allow these large fields to be still  
 sub-divided to control cattle but     
 hedge removal means less wildlife &amp;   
 perhaps soil erosion.There have been  
 some redundancies,as animals for milk 
 require more labour than crops &amp; also 
 the number of milkings per day has    
 been reduced from 3 to 2.Lower quotas 
 have caused little complete job loss  
 on the family-run farms of the area.  </content>
