		<title>08DAILY LIFE OF A MUSLIM BOY</title>
		<content> I wake up at 6.00am on a school day,  
 get dressed and washed in a special   
 way and then perform the{Fajar}       
 (morning prayer).  After breakfast I  
 set off for Westborough High School at
 8.30am ready for a busy day of        
 lessons.                              
 After school I return home, wash,     
 change and have my tea - usually      
 chuppaties and gosht (meat curry).  I 
 then perform the{Zohar}(afternoon     
 prayer).                              
 At 5.30pm I go to the Mosque where I  
 read the Koran, learn Urdu and perform
 the{Asar}(evening prayer).            
 From 7.00pm until 9.00pm my time is my
 own and I use it for homework and     
 playing football with my friends.  At 
 9.45pm I get washed and undressed,    
 perform the{Magrib}(sunset prayer),   
 then drop into bed, tired but looking 
 forward to another day.               </content>
