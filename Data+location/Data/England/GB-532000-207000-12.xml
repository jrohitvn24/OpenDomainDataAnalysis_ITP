		<title>12WEAVER'S STUDIO, HODDESDON</title>
		<content> Just a stone's throw from the busy Al0
 in a barn at Home Farm you will find  
 28 yr. old Alison Thompson busy at one
 of her 3 looms weaving rugs, cushions 
 &amp; wall hangings of landscapes, seaside
 scenes &amp; historical houses. Her       
 beautiful work is to her own designs  
 using traditional handweaving         
 techniques. It has been exhibited at  
 Craft Fairs in Wales &amp; England &amp; with 
 great success at the London Barbican. 
 Major commissions include libraries,  
 restaurants &amp; offices &amp; much of her   
 work has been sold overseas. She      
 studied Textile Design at Loughborough
 and in l98l opened The Studio in the  
 Barn. Alison also teaches Art &amp; Design
 in a Herts Secondary School &amp; gives   
 talks locally. This autumn her first  
 baby is due but her craft will        
 continue as she plans to combine      
 motherhood and weaving !              </content>
