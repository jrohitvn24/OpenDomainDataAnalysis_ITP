 and is biannual. There is a varied    
 programme to cater for the interests  
 of the whole town. As well as famous  
 names like Julian Lloyd Webber there  
 have been jazz groups, comedians,     
 ballet and Street Theatre. There is   
 local talent too and a combined       
 schools' concert. Festival '86 is well
 underway with many plans for an       
 exciting and stimulaling two weeks in{
