		<content> The local policeman is closely        
 involved with the community.He        
 operates as part of a 9 man team      
 covering a number of local villages.  
 From his house in the village he is   
 responsible for an area containing    
 about 8000 people.Much of his work is 
 aimed at crime prevention through     
 "community policing",working with the 
 co-operation of the villagers.He also 
 attends meetings of the Parish        
 Council.                              
 Transport amenities in the village are
 largely provided by private cars since
 the bus service is relatively         
 inconvenient,especially in the        
 evening.Thus,for those people most    
 affected - the elderly and the young- 
 social life can be restricted and this
 gives rise to some concern.
