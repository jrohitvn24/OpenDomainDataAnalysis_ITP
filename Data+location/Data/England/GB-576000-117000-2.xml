		<title>02History of Sedlescombe</title>
		<content> This area consists of beautiful       
 unspoilt countryside containing the   
 villages of Sedlescombe and           
 Whatlington. A village existed here   
 long before Norman times. Remains have
 been found of early ironworks. It is  
 believed that iron was worked in this 
 area well before Roman times. The iron
 industry thrived during the Roman     
 occupation. The manufacturing of      
 gunpowder also grew here. It is only  
 in the last 150 years Sedlescombe has 
 assumed its present rural and placid  
 village nature. In 1831 the population
 of Sedlescombe was 732 and it was now 
 a farming area. Other occupations were
 charcoal burning and making hop poles.
 Around the village green were three   
 blacksmiths, a bootmaker, a           
 carpenter's yard, a butcher, a        
 toyshop, an art gallery and a         
 Methodist chapel.                     </content>
