		<title>02Fairfield Court, Fairfield</title>
		<content> We visited Fairfield Court built in   
 16th century. Mrs Edge came out to    
 meet us then we went inside the Court.
 First we went into the lounge which   
 used to be 2 rooms and there used to  
 be a ladder leading upstairs. We went 
 into a bedroom which was very         
 sloping, then on to the landing and   
 looked at the banisters. We went in   
 a room where there used to be a little
 chapel. When we were going down the   
 stairs to go into the garden we saw a 
 priest hole. Outside Mr Edge showed us
 the gardens. After that he told us    
 where the gallows were and that they  
 had found an animal bone, which they  
 had taken to the vets.The vet told    
 them it was a human leg bone. There   
 were some steps made from mill stones 
 Also around the garden there are      
 staddle stones. We went on to the     
 front lawn and drew a picture.        </content>
