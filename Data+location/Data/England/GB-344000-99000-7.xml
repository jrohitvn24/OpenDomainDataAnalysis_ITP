		<content> Life moves slowly in these friendly   
 villages, work done tomorrow rather   
 than today, except in emergencies when
 action is prompt.  New comers moving  
 into the area are welcomed but        
 cottages sold as second homes or for  
 holiday letting cause some annoyance; 
 bed and breakfast provided in private 
 houses being acceptable.  Villagers   
 may grumble over lack of street       
 lighting, vandalism (fairly minor) or 
 street parking but rarely feel        
 strongly enough to take action.       
 All are worried by the loss of        
 amenities such as shop, pub and school
 fearing the life of the village may   
 wither and young people be unwilling  
 to remain.  The newcomers are         
 generally more enthusiastic in        
 supporting social events than the     
 original residents but all turn out on
 occasions such as the Harvest Supper. </content>
