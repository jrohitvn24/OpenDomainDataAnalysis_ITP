		<content> There is a youth club in every area.  
 The nearest one to us is at           
 Swallowbeck.It is run in a Methodist  
 Church Hall.The hall is Rectangular   
 and the area is that of the ground    
 floor of an average house.At one end  
 of the hall sweets, crisps and drinks 
 are sold.There is one person who runs 
 the youth club but there are usually  
 one or two helpers.                   
   The club is equipped with one table-
 tennis table,two snooker tables,a dart
 board and two record players as well  
 as small games.There are about fifty  
 members but only about half that      
 number go on the same night.Youth Club
 is on Friday evenings from eight      
 o'clock until ten o'clock.
