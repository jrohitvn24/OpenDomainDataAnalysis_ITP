		<title>06WINTERTON SHOW 2</title>
		<content> There has always been jam making and  
 bread making. The animal shows are    
 mainly on dogs and rabbits. They began
 in 1850. In 1971 they started to have 
 floats as an annual event. This was   
 for the celebration of a 100 years    
 since the show began. The different   
 groups of people pick the theme for   
 the floats, this year it is nursery   
 rhymes. There was a one mile race. One
 time it had more than 70 entries. Now 
 there is a 10 mile race. Everyone who 
 enters gets a medal. In 1872 there    
 were penny farthing races. The first  
 prize used to be a gold watch and the 
 second a gold helmet. About 50 years  
 ago Winterton had its own band to play
 at the show. The Committee once paid  
 Â£300 for the Irish Guards to come and 
 play at the show. In 1954 the Queen   
 visited the show.
