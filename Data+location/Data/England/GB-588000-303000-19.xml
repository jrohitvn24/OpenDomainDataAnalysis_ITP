		<title>19SHOPPING IN ASHILL</title>
		<content> Not just a village shop but a place   
 where knowledge is passed on and where
 views are exchanged.                  
 Selling a wide range of groceries and 
 other goods we are now used as a top  
 up for the villagers with only a few  
 doing their main shopping here.       
 Open from 8:30 am until 9:00 pm       
 Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 8:30 am
 to 5:30 pm Monday and Tuesday and     
 10:00 am to 12:30 pm Sundays. Closed  
 all day Wednesday.                    
 Increased competition from            
 supermarkets is gradually seeing the  
 demise of stores such as ours.        
 Social events, dances, notices of     
 meetings etc. are advertised and we   
 are used to pass on messages, to act  
 as a collecting point and ticket      
 seller for local events.              
 Although we offer a delivery service  
 few of our customers actually use it. </content>
