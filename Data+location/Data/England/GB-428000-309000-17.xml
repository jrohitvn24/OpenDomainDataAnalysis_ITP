		<content>  The shooting in{STRETTON}is pheasant 
 pigeon,partridge.We shoot pigeons     
 between October to January because    
 there is no date that you should shoot
 them in.We used to rear our own       
 pheasants and partridge but now we buy
 them from a Game Farm.We put our      
 pheasants into a release pen for about
 6 weeks in June and July. Then when   
 they are about 11 weeks old we let    
 them out of the pens and put them into
 the woods.                            
  The shooting in{Chilcote}is only     
 partridge and duck. We feed the ducks 
 on two ponds and we shoot them from   
 September the 1st .There are  some    
 snipe,mallard,teal and coots on the   
 pond.Once there were some swans as    
 well.                                 
  About once a year the Atherstone     
 hunt meet at the Old Rectory in       
 Appleby.                              </content>
