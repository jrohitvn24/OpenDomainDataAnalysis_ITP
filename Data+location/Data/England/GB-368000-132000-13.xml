		<title>13King's School - Activities.</title>
		<content> Rugby, hockey and cricket are the     
 School's principal sports.  However,  
 teams also participate in basketball, 
 fencing, shooting, squash and         
 swimming. Athletics and cross country 
 are becoming increasingly popular. The
 School has a total of 34 acres of     
 playing fields, as well as two squash 
 courts, 9 tennis courts, and a        
 hard-play area.  Hobbies and interests
 include bridge, chess, canoeing,      
 electronics, horticulture, judo,      
 photography and printing.  Music and  
 drama are very important activities,  
 and a play is produced each term in   
 the School's 211-seat theatre.  At    
 Christmas 1983, the School performed  
 the first ever amateur production of  
 the musical, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips".
