		<content>  THIS GRID AREA IS A NOTED FARMING    
 AREA. THE DARK PEAT SOIL IS AN IDEAL  
 GROWING MEDIUM,  AND THE FLATNESS OF  
 THE AREA LEND THEM SELVES TO ARABLE   
 FARMING.THE REMOVAL OF TREES AND      
 HEDGES AND THE INCREASED SIZE OF FARMS
 AND THEIR FIELDS MAKE THE USE OF LARGE
 MACHINES EASIER.                      
    FARMING IS EXTREMELY INTENSIVE,    
 PARTICULARLY AS E.E.C. SUBSIDIES      
 ENCOURAGE THE SORT OF CROP GROWING    
 SUITED TO THIS AREA. THERE IS A HIGH  
 USE OF CHEMICAL FERTILISERS,          
 INSECTICIDES, AND WEED KILLERS.       
    ROOT VEGETABLES (CARROTS,          
 POTATOES), CEREALS (WHEAT, BARLEY),   
 AND SUGAR BEET  ARE THE MOST COMMON,  
 TOGETHER WITH OIL - SEED RAPE.        
    THE WHITTLESEY AREA IS RENOWNED FOR
 GROWING CELERY - WHITTLESEY SEEDLINGS 
 ARE SENT AROUND THE WORLD TO GROW ON.
