		<content> The village bricks were made in North 
 Cambridgeshire in Beckwell Whites.    
 Clay was dug out of the pond and baked
 hard.the clunch for the cottages came 
 from clunch pits in South             
 Cambridgeshire and is chalk. The beams
 were of oak, the thatch, reed or      
 straws. Windows were of lead with     
 shutters. The new houses are often    
 built of old materials to be in       
 keeping with the old. The mill is made
 of Cambridge bricks and wood cladding 
 and was grinding corn until the 1960's
 The mill house is one of the oldest   
 houses in the village and is over 300 
 years old inside. The outside is about
 100 years, for as the millers became  
 better off they built a better house  
 around the old one.
