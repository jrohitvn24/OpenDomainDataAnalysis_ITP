		<title>11O.S. Area 4141-3839</title>
		<content> This area is mainly farmland, with a  
 fairly large wood in the North West   
 and some woodland in the North East.  
 The most intresting aspect in Becca   
 Hall (for further information see page
 14) in the North East. The farmland is
 a mixture of crops (oats, potatoes,   
 sugar beet, barley and hay) and       
 livestock (cattle and sheep). The     
 woods are largely deciduous. In the   
 North is Becca Hall Farm, consisting  
 of three houses and 10 outbuildings.  
 It is owned by F.W. and R.Q. Richmond 
 and is over 50 years old. Eight people
 live on the farm. On the road joining 
 Becca Hall Farm to Becca Hall there   
 are 3 private houses. A public        
 footpath runs from the North West to  
 the South East of the section.
