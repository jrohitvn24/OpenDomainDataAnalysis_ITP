 There are three garages in the area,2 
 on the Braintree-Chelmsford Rd. and 1 
 at Fuller St.At Fuller St. no petrol  
 is served but a coach service is      
 operated from there.They transport    
 prisoners from Chelmsford prison to a 
 county court ,and on to other prisons 
 if need be.                           
 One of the garages is owned by a      
 naional company,but does very little  
 car servicing.The other has 5         
 mechanics and 10 other staff.Both     
 garages sell approximately 30,000     
 litres a week at 43.91pence per       
 litre.This price was correct on the   
 24th of June 1985.They get their      
 petrol from ULTRAMAR refineries at    
 Purfleet,Essex.Most people pay for    
 petrol by cash,but 40% use credit     
 cards.                                
                                       </content>
