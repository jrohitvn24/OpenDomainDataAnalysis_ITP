 centre for many Scotton activities -  
 playgroup,Sunday School,plays,dances, 
 meetings,parties etc.Built on land    
 given by{Mrs M Littlewood,}the        
 prefabricated Marley building replaced
 the old church hall (small and lacking
 in facilities).Financed partly by{    
{grant aid}and partly from money raised
 after many years of fund raising:whist
 drives,sponsored walks,coffee mornings
 etc.Self supporting through income    
 from letting and some fund raising,the
 hall is run by a management committee 
 of representatives of village         
 organisations and 3 elected members.In
 1980 it won the{Community Council of  
{Lincolnshire Village Hall Competition.
  In 1980 the committee built a doubles
 hard tennis court behind the hall and 
 this is well used all year long.
