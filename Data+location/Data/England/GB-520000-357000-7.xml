		<title>07A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> I am Caroline, age 9.My               
 mother is a school teacher and my     
 father is a navigator in the R.A.F.I  
 have a sister called Justine and a    
 brother called Michael.On Saturday    
 morning ,I get up at half past seven  
 get dressed and get ready to go to the
 stables.Then I wake up my mum and I go
 down stairs.I draw the curtains and   
 get my breakfast. I keep my puppy shut
 in the kitchen to stop him chewing.   
 Then I go to the stables I groom some 
 ponies and tack them up for people to 
 ride.Then I muck out some stables.Then
 I have my lunch with my friend Zoe.   
 After lunch we go down the field and  
 set up a jumping course.We feed the   
 horses . I normally feed my favourite 
 pony Strawberry.At four my mum        
 collects me.When I get home I have a  
 bath and get in my night things, watch
 Dynasty on the T.V.and go to bed.     </content>
