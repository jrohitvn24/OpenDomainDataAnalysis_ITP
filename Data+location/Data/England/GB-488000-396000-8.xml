		<content> (2) Crops and Livestock               
 Arable farming predominates, the main 
 crops being barley, wheat, rye, sugar 
 beet, grass, oil seed rape, peas and  
 potatoes (a number of women find      
 casual employment helping with the    
 potato harvest).  Some years ago many 
 farmers kept livestock - sheep, pigs  
 and cattle, but increased costs of    
 foodstuff and of labour have made it  
 uneconomic for all but a few.  Now    
 there are only two Scotton farmers    
 with livestock - sheep: at lambing    
 time a favourite walk for children and
 adults alike is to see the lambs in   
 the fields down Kirton Road.  At      
 Northorpe Robert Dickinson keeps the  
 prizewinning Northorpe Herd of South  
 Devon Cattle.  The Dickinsons have a  
 collection of rare breeds of farm     
 animals and their living "museum" is  
 visited by many school parties.       </content>
