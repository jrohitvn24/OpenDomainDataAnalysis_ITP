		<content>   The continuation of present trends  
 in the area will depend upon how      
 tightly the{Green Belt}policy is      
 pursued. In 1985 one developer        
 presented a proposal for a mini New   
 Town in the Green Belt, only a few    
 kilometres away from the block. This  
 has been strongly resisted. To date   
 the Green Belt has restricted the     
{growth of London}and also of towns    
 within the Green Belt, such as        
 Brentwood, pushing up{property prices 
 within them. The current migration out
 of London to the{suburbs}has pushed up
 property prices even higher. The high 
 cost of{commuting}seems not to act as 
 a deterrent. Problems of{unemployment 
 are relatively minor. The area seems  
 to be amongst the most prosperous in  
 Britain. Only radical change in       
 government policy would be likely to  
 change the situation.                 </content>
