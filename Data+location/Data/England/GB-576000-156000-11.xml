The main method of transport in this   
area is by road, but apart from the    
usual ones linking local areas there   
are also very important ones linking   
the region.                            
                                       
Firstly the M20, linking London to     
Folkestone, can be joined here. It     
is important for the area because it   
brings in tourism and industry from    
the rest of Europe.                    
                                       
Secondly the A249 links the M2         
(London to Dover) to the M20, and      
North-East Kent to Maidstone.          
                                       
Lastly there is the very historic      
Pilgrims Way, a route used since       
prehistoric times linking Winchester   
and Canterbury.  Many settlements      
originated because of it.              </content>
