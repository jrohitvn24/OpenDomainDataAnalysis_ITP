		<title>04KENTS OAK MUSHROOM FARM</title>
		<content>      The number of mushrooms picked   
 each day varies from 1000_4000 boxes. 
 Each box contains between two and     
 three pounds.  Open mushrooms cost    
 Â£2.40 for three pounds.  Cup mushrooms
 cost Â£3.00.  Most of the mushrooms are
 sold at Southampton market.  Some     
 people buy mushrooms from the farm    
 itself.  There are 18 pickers who are 
 on piece work, 3 packers paid by the  
 hour and 6 outside workers who clear  
 the trays of spent compost, clean the 
 trays and plant the spawn.            
      There are 15 picking sheds.      
 After planting the spawn the trays are
 kept in heated sheds.  It takes about 
 six weeks before the trays are ready  
 for picking and each tray can be      
 picked for about six weeks.  Mushrooms
 are grown all the year round at this  
 farm in{Awbridge.
