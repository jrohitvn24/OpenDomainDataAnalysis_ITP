		<title>20A Day in the Life of Joanne</title>
		<content> I rise at 7.30, wash, dress, then eat 
 breakfast which consists of cereal or 
 toast. Then I take my bag and catch   
 the coach to school at 8.15. There  we
 have many subjects including English, 
 French, Maths, and Science. At morning
 break I meet friends who are in other 
 classes. Lunch-time is at 12.00 when I
 eat my sandwiches. After school I get 
 home at about 4.30.I make myself      
 something to eat and drink and watch  
 television.Then I do my homework which
 is two subjects per night. Usually I  
 play with a friend, Sarah but other   
 times,I go for walks or play at sports
 with my family.Then I watch television
 until 9.00,.when I go to bed. I read  
 for about an hour before sleeping.
