and are often mistaken for birds       
droppings.

confuse with any other butterfly.It has
reddy-brown wings with  large          
colourful spots.Adults hibernate in    
winter.Eggs are laid on nettle leaves. 
The small skipper is a small           
orange-brown butterfly,with a skipping 
flight.It looks like a moth because of 
it's short hairy body and the way it   
holds itÂ£s wings.
