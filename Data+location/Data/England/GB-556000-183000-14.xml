		<title>14CRANHAM PLACE: UPMINSTER</title>
		<content> Cranham Place is situated close to the
 M25 motorway in the parish of{North   
{Ockendon.}It was originally a Manor,  
 consisting of{a house, a barn, &amp; a    
{stable.}The Manor House was destroyed 
 in a fire fifteen years ago &amp; was     
 rebuilt as flats subsequently.        
 The barn next to the House has been   
 restored &amp; converted into a bungalow  
 whereas the stables have been made    
 into a detached house. Mr. Efferson   
 the current owner rents out all these 
 premises. Previously they were owned  
 jointly by Mr. Knight &amp; Mr. Huelston. 
   The area surrounding Cranham Place  
 has had its fair share of disasters.  
 Nearby Manor Church was bombed during 
 the war but survived the blast.
