		<content> Darfield is a large village on the    
 outskirts of Barnsley.In the village  
 are about 9000 people.It is a friendly
 village with lots of pubs and clubs.  
 Darfield is surrounded by countryside 
 and other small villages. It is a     
 mining village with a strong sporting 
 tradition. An annual gala is held on  
 the big field for cubs ,guides and    
 the community.Old people are cared for
 in residential and sheltered homes. In
 the centre of the village there are a 
 few shops. The village has been       
 considerably enlarged by the building 
 of a new housing estate. I have       
 lived in Darfield all my life and I   
 am twelve,so there is no way I would  
 want to move as I like it so much.
