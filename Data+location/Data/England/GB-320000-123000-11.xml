		<content>  In our school we have three areas and
 they have all got names.The first area
 is called the yellow area,the second  
 area is called the red area and the   
 third area is called the green area.  
  The green area is the infant area.I  
 used to be an infant but now I am a   
 junior.When I was an infant we did    
 'story'-our teacher would write it    
 down for us while we told her what to 
 write and when she had finished we    
 used to copy it out.Then we had to    
 draw a picture.Now I am a 3rd year    
 junior and our tests we do each year  
 get harder because we do subjects like
 History,Geography and Science.These   
 subjects are when we study things and 
 do experiments and write down what we 
 have recorded.After I am a 4th year   
 junior I will go to another school and
 do harder work and I will have to do a
 lot of homework.                      </content>
