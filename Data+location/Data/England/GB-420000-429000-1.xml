		<title>01GAZETTEER OF TONG AREA</title>
		<content> This block is predominantly an        
 undulating green belt lying between   
 the industrial cities of Leeds,       
 Bradford, Wakefield and Dewsbury.  Two
 important main roads cross the area,  
 the A58 trunk road Leeds to Halifax   
 and the A 650 Bradford to Wakefield.  
 The rural village of Tong occupies the
 centre of the block but three         
 industrial villages of Gildersome,    
 Birkenshaw and Driglington are        
 partially included.  There is still a 
 large area covered by farmland but    
 because most of the land is 500 feet  
 above sea level it is mainly used for 
 pasture.                              
                                       
 A small industrial estate has grown up
 in the past ten years along the A650  
 at Westgate Hill.  There are some     
 older industries in the Gildersome    
 area .                                </content>
