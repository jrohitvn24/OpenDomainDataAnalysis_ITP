		<content> The area under survey has changed     
over the past six years and will be    
subject to further, more rapid changes 
in the future.                         
 A major social issue is the proposed  
A1-M1 link road.  If approved this will
cut across farmland close to Nasby and 
the historic battlefield.              
 Although Clipston village has grown   
considerably over the past few years,  
the price of new housing is between 45-
64,000 pounds. Making it impossible for
young people from the village to buy   
their own home within the village.     
 Public transport is very limited,     
therefore the population generally is  
very dependent upon its own transport. 
Many families have by necessity to run 
two cars.                              
 Clipston is on the main flight path of
fighter aircraft en route from R.A.F   
Wittering to Wales,disturbing the peace</content>
