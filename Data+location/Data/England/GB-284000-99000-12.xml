 Dr. Sir Jack Shelley has all sorts of 
 sports at Shobrooke Park. The type of 
 sports are:

 lake and is run as a commercial       
 venture, and is taught by an          
 Australian.                           
 Fishing-the kind of fish you          
 can catch are (Tench, Carp and Mirror 
 Carp) and to go fishing you have to   
 have a (PERMIT.Shobrooke Sports are a 
 local school tornament.               
 The Cricket Club is also on the       
 Shobrooks Park grounds and is open to 
 everybody.                            
 Walking is a leisurely sport and often

 Picnicking and courting are two other 
 sports.
