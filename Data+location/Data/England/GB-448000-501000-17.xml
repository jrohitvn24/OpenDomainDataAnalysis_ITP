		<content> Although no evening classes in crafts 
 are held in Faceby, there are several 
 ladies with various skills. One takes 
 classes in neighbouring villages,     
 specialising in{soft furnishing}and   
 all types of{embroidery}including     
 ecclesiastical. Another, a farmer's   
 wife, has made{corn dollies}for many  
 years, produces exquisite{lace}which  
 wins her many prizes at local shows,  
 and does{counted-thread work, canvas  
{and patchwork.}She has a spinning     
 wheel and, when time allows,{spins and
{weaves wool}from her own sheep.       
 Another Faceby lady makes{scraperboard
 pictures. From time to time a         
 handicraft exhibition is held in the  
 village. In the Swainby part of the   
 block a retired ICI engineer{paints}  
 landscapes and abstracts, using       
 acrylics because of allergy to some   
 substance in water-colour paints.     </content>
