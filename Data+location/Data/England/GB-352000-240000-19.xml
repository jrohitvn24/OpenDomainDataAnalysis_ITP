		<title>19HEREFORD CANAL SOCIETY</title>
		<content>    In April 1983 the Herefordshire    
 and Gloucestershire Canal Society was 
 formed to take an interest in the     
 former canal.                         
    In the two years the Society       
 has been in existence it has achieved 
 some notable successes; both the      
 Hereford City Council and the South   
 Herefordshire District Council have   
 passed resolutions supporting the     
 protection of the line of the canal   
 and a proposal to the same effect has 
 been included in the Ledbury and      
 District Plan.                        
    The Society is restoring a short   
 length of the canal at Monkhide       
 and has received financial support on 
 two occasions from the Welsh Water    
 Authority and a donation of Â£500 has  
 recently been received from the Inland
 Waterways Association.
