 D-block situated at 60.5,60.2. 63.3,  
 60.85. 63.05,61.2. 63.05,60.9. From   
 these we have discovered that the     
{average farm}has 156 acres and employs
 2 workers. The number of employees has
 fallen over the last 20 years,due to  
{new farming methods and mechanization.
 Most are{mixed,arable and stock farms 
 growing Winter cereals,sugar-beet and 
 fodder-beet.They also grow grass which
 is made into hay or silage.Most of    
 these crops are used for winter feed .
 the land is rich in phosphate there   
 fore little is added.Other fertilizers
 used are nitrogen and potash.Stock is 
 bought and sold at{York Livestock     
{Centre}but one farmer visits 83       
 different  markets stretched over the 
 UK.The cost of a calf ranges from Â£8O 
 to Â£16O.A bull Â£1,000 to Â£10,000.
