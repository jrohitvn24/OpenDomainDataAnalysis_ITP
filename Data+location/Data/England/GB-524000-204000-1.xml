		<title>01Brookmans Park Village</title>
		<content>    Brookmans Park is really not a     
 village in the true sense. In the old 
 villages, people were born and brought
 up there and usually worked there all 
 their lives. Brookmans Park is a      
 commuter village with most of the     
 population working either in London or
 nearby large towns. This is why the   
 main railway line to Moorgate and     
 King's Cross is so important as it is 
 used by a large number of business men
 to get to work.                       
    Most of the people who live in     
 Brookmans Park are quite wealthy and  
 the houses are mostly detached and    
 very expensive. Many of the roads are 
 private and the upkeep is paid for by 
 the residents.                        
    Apart from the houses in the       
 village, the area being studied is    
 mostly country as we are in the Green 
 Belt.                                 </content>
