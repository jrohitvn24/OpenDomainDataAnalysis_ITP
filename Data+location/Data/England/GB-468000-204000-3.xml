		<title>03Thame Market</title>
		<content>Thame market was originally a medieval 
cattle market and has been held here   
since 1227.(see Trade) It is situated  
in the High Street which is the second 
widest in the country. It is an open   
market which is held every Tuesday from
8.00am until 4.00pm and good weather is
vital for sales.                       
There are 53 stalls, the main ones     
selling food and clothes. The market   
traders are responsible for the stalls 
in the market and as the rent is so low
there is fierce competition to trade   
there.                                 
The people who shop at the market are  
mostly elderly who enjoy the friendly  
atmosphere and bargaining. The market  
is also popular with young mothers who 
bring their children to help them get  
their weekly stores. The market        
provides the town with much of its     
character.                             </content>
