		<title>10A Farmer's Wife.</title>
		<content>     Mrs.C. the farmer's wife has to   
 get up early in the morning to get all
 her jobs done. After breakfast she    
 helps her children get ready for      
 school and if it is wet, she drives   
 them there in the car.                
     The farm has a large flock of     
 sheep and this year she has 21 cade   
 lambs to rear by hand. She feeds them 
 several times a day with warm powdered
 milk in a bottle. As they grow larger 
 she weans them on to solid food and   
 then they do not need so much of her  
 time. When the lambs are big enough   
 they are taken to Skegness and sold.  
     Mrs.C. has l5 chickens which lay  
 about 5 dozen eggs per week. These    
 have to be fed and the eggs collected.
 She also has 5 pedigree Scottish      
 Border sheep dogs from which they     
 breed twice a year. She has spent all 
 her life on one farm or another.      </content>
