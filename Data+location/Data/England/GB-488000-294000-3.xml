		<title>03CHANGING GRETTON SINCE 1945</title>
		<content>In 1945 there were two bakers', six    
grocers', a newsagent's, a butcher's,  
two sweet shops and four public        
houses. Today both bakers', five       
grocers', the butcher's, the sweet     
shops and one of the public houses have
closed. In 1945 clothes were made in a 
small factory but today the factory    
makes electrical control panels.  Milk 
used to be delivered to the door in    
churns from a local farm. It was       
measured out and poured into jugs.     
Today it is delivered in bottles.      
Children attended the village school   
until they left at 14 years old; today 
they transfer to a secondary school at 
the age of 11.  A railway passed       
through the village, with trains       
stopping at Gretton station, now       
closed.  Villagers drew their water    
from wells and there were no sewers.   
Now there is mains water and a sewer.  </content>
