		<content>   Dereham is not a tourist centre in  
 the accepted sense, but it serves as a
 central point from which visitors to  
 Norfolk can make their expeditions to 
 some of the tourist attractions which 
 are plentiful in the County.  It is   
 within easy reach of the coast, the   
 capital city of Norwich with its fine 
 Cathedral, and some of the country's  
 loveliest stately homes, such as      
 Houghton Hall, Holkham Hall and       
 Blickling Hall.                       
 Dereham itself has its buildings of   
 historic interest such as the         
 birthplace of George Borrow, the tomb 
 of the poet Cowper and St. Withburga's
 Well.                                 
 There are three well-appointed hotels 
 and a number of private homes which   
 cater for short-stay visitors.
