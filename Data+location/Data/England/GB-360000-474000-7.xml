		<content> In our block there are three haulage  
 firms called D. Bradshaw &amp; Son,       
 Shuttleworths and J.Pelters &amp; Son. D. 
 Bradshaw has his main work shop and   
 place where he keeps his wagons in the
 old station yard. Bradshaws don't     
 specialise in any particular kind of  
 haulage. Shuttleworths on the other   
 hand transport fertilizer and mainly  
 sheep and livestock. They work mainly 
 from Cowan Bridge where they live.    
 Pelter's have their base in           
 Whittington and they have mostly      
 tipper lorries. Their lorries help in 
 Motorway contracting and they helped  
 to build the M6. Some of the haulage  
 is from the I.C.I. warehouse which is 
 the other big warehouse in the area.  
 I.C.I. sells fertiliser, silo sheets  
 and silo bags. Farmers pick up those  
 items from there.
