		<content> The {Doctor} will come when we        
 telephone the local health centre, but
 they prefer us to go to them. Many    
 health centres serve our area and all 
 severe cases go to Torbay {Hospital}. 
 Emergency calls are made by dialling  
 999 then an  ambulance  will reach us 
 as quickly as possible and take us to 
 a casualty department. The District { 
{Nurse} visits people who have come out
 of hospital after an operation. She   
 travels from South Brent to see the   
 sick and elderly people who need      
 attention. Often she dresses wounds   
 and gives injections  to save people  
 from travelling to the Health Centre.
