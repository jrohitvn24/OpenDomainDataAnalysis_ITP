		<title>12St Peters Church.</title>
		<content> Generally the rectors of St. Peters   
 have been law abiding clergymen but   
 there was a certain Thomas Bole of    
 Tempsford who during the reign of     
 Henry 6th was outlawed for treason.   
 Another rector of the parish a Giles  
 King who after the civil war refused  
 to accept the new order disappeared   
 into obscurity.                       
 During the civil war Bedfordshire was 
 only lukewarm to the Kings cause, and 
 only one Charles Upton of Tempsford   
 declared his sympathy for the king but
 he never went to war.                 
 Once the very  keystone of people's   
 lives St.Peters like many other       
 village churches suffers a dwinderling
 congregation.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
