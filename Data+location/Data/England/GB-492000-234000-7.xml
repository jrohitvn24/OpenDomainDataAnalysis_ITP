   Aspley Guise School ran a survey on 
 pets.  21 families kept none at all.  
 Of the remaining sample there were 35 
 cat and 33 dog owners;18 families kept
 fish, 16 rabbits,10 chickens,6        
 hamsters,6 guinea pigs 1 a goose and 1
 a deer. A lot of families kept more   
 than one pet.                         
   At home we have two cats, some      
 chickens, cockerels, a goose and a    
 deer.  The poultry like to eat corn   
 and the deer eats the grass.  I feed  
 the cats every day at tea time and at 
 breakfast.  My mum feeds the chickens.
 Soon I am going to get a rabbit.{
