		<content> The village of{Ordley}stood on a      
 promontory above Devils Water. In     
{1663}it was described as a 'large     
 towne'of 400 people,on the old pack   
 horse route from Allendale to         
 Hexham.However,{population dwindled,  
 buildings fell into disrepair,and with
 the closure of the school in 1953,the 
{village virtually died.}However, a    
 far-seeing property developer realised
 the opportunities for{re-development, 
 and Ordley Village is about to be     
 reborn.{4}of the existing derelict    
 buildings,the Farmhouse, School       
 Cottage,and 2 barns,are being{restored
 and converted, and there are plans for
{6 new houses}to be constructed. In a  
 year or two's time,there should be a  
 new Ordley village, standing on the   
 site of the old.
