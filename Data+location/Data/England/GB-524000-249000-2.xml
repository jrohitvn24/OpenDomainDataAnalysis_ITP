		<content>     The church is dedicated to St.    
 John the Baptist and was once the     
 church belonging to the old manor but 
 it is now the parish church. It is    
 built in the Decorated Style of       
 English Church of local sandstone     
 infilled with rubble.                 
     Although its exterior is not      
 unusual its interior decorations      
 certainly are, and make it a          
 unique church since{all}its woodwork, 
 apart from some modern benches added  
 in the last two years, is not only    
 foreign but of Roman Catholic origin. 
 A restoration was undertaken in 1806  
 by the Reverend Henry Cockayne Cust   
 and the entire interior of the church 
 was redecorated with beautifully      
 carved woodwork from Catholic         
 Monastries and churches in the Low    
 Countries. Unfortunately the money ran
 out before an organ could be built.   </content>
