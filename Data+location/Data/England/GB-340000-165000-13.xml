		<content> Yatton is situated along a slight     
 ridge rising above the surrounding    
 low-lying meadowland.Before drainage  
 schemes were introduced these areas   
 were subject to flooding and sometimes
  incursions by the sea.Because of     
 drainage problems most of the         
 surrounding farmland is used for dairy
 cattle or growing hay.To the south of 
 Yatton the small river Yeo meanders   
 its way to the sea . To the north,an  
 area known as the Moors is a haven for
 wetlands flora and fauna-wild iris,   
 lapwings, herons and small wading     
 birds. At the south-east of the       
 village lies Cadbury Hill.Owned by    
 Yatton and Congresbury parish councils
 this prehistoric hillfort is notable  
 for its rare plants and butterflies.A 
 former quarry has been used for       
 dumping rubbish.
