		<content>   British farmers have in general,    
 been much criticised for{removing     
{hedges}in order to enlarge their      
 fields and give easier access to their
 larger farm machinery. This has       
 decimated the{natural habitats}of     
 wildlife and vegetation, and has      
 inevitably upset the balance of       
 nature.                               
   Farming organisations are now very  
 concerned about this, and the image of
 farming communities. So,they are      
 spending enormous sums of money to    
{re-site and replace}any natural growth
 they remove in the name of progress.  
   The owner of Weston Mill has been   
 particularly active in this, and has  
 planted trees in great numbers along  
 the roadsides on his property. He is  
 very anxious that the Public recognise
 that fact, and are not unfairly       
 critical of modern farming methods.   </content>
