		<title>11Uses of Ponds &amp; Waterways.</title>
		<content>The Pond in the centre of the village  
Plain is a main feature of Goudhurst.  
The beautiful beech and horse chestnut 
trees provide shade to visitors and    
locals who like to sit on the seats and
watch the ducks. In 1965 the Pond      
sprung a leak and had to be drained and
the fault remedied. Over the area there
are many ponds marked on maps, some    
relics of the iron working, known as   
hammer ponds. Unfortunately when we    
came to survey the area some of these  
have been lost due to silting through  
lack of use or to progressive farming. 
Before mains water these ponds were a  
useful source for watering farm        
animals. There are several small rivers
tributaries of the River Teise, which  
traverse the area. They are of use for 
irrigation and some coarse fishing.
