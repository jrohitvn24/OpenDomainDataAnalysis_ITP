		<content>  We are told that there is a          
 revolution about to take over our     
 lives in terms of communicating. We   
 can already use our credit card       
 numbers to order things advertised on 
 the television. Radio telephones which
 allow people to talk on the telephone 
 from their cars or any other location 
 they wish are becoming very popular.  
 News items, weather and interesting   
 information can be called up on       
 television screens. Verbal            
 communication seems to be in a decline
 as most people spend most of their    
 time staring at television screens.
