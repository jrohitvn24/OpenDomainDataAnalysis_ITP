		<title>20Religion in Frome</title>
		<content> After nearly half a century of        
 decline, Frome's churches are showing 
 signs of growth.  A great deal of     
 change is being brought about by      
 inter-church missionary activity,     
 which is a feature of church life     
 today.   In l985 the town has 4       
 Anglican churches, 2 Methodist, one   
 Baptist, a United Reformed, a Roman   
 Catholic, 2 Evangelical, 1            
 Congregational and a small Friend's   
 meeting. At Selwood School our survey 
 amongst children showed 20% attended  
 Sunday School regularly; &amp; a survey of
 adults showed church attendance -     
 regularly 19%, occasionally 38%, never
 43%.  Of those who attend, Anglicans  
 were 30%, Methodist 6%, Baptist 2%,   
 Catholic 5%, United Reformed 3% &amp;     
 others ll%.
