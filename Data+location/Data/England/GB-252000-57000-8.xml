		<content>   About half of this area is farmland.
 About half of the farmland is pasture 
 and the rest is put to cereal crops.  
   Wheat is grown for milling into     
 flour,barley and oats are mainly grown
 for animal feed.They also harvest hay 
 to feed cows and sheep in winter.     
 Farmers also cut grass and make silage
 for winter feed.                      
   There is one dairy herd in this area
 that produces milk.Sheep are kept on  
 the dryer fields.There is also a small
 amount of moorland grazing on the edge
 of Lee Moor to the north east.        
   There is an agricultural merchants  
 in the area that supplys fertiliser,  
 seed and machinery parts.There is     
 also a small nursery that sells plants
 and bushes.                           
   In the recent past,many of the      
 hedges have been grubbed out in order 
 to create larger fields.              </content>
