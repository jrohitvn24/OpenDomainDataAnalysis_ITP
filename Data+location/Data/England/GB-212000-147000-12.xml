		<title>12The Boat Trip (continued).</title>
		<content> When we had gone a bit further  we    
 slowed down to go into Jenny's Cove.  
 When we had stopped we saw two        
 Puffins, one was in the water,one was 
 flying.We saw lots more different     
 birds as well.We stayed there for ten 
 minutes.When we had gone a bit        
 further we saw Battery Point and the  
 Old Light.When we went past the       
 South lighthouse George sounded the   
 fog horn.We all waved to him.When we  
 were back where we started from,the   
 little blue boat picked us up.We saw  
 Mr.Hanks on Rat Island and it looked  
 like they were stuck.Later we saw them
 come out of a cave that went through  
 the island.While they were doing that 
 we were climbing some rocks and       
 looking in some rock pools. We saw a  
 strawberry. It was not real,it was a  
 Sea Anemone.
