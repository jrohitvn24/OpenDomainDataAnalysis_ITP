 activities; mini motor bikes,pony     
 rides,video car-drive, coconut shy,   
 Aunt Sally, treasure island, bottle   
 stall, and air-rifle shooting. At the 
 end of the afternoon{a crazy football 
{match}was held -the ladies dressed up 
 as men, the men as women. After a lot 
 of cheating the ladies won. Finally   
 there were running races for the      
 children.Refreshments could be bought:
 chips,jacket potatoes,tea,coffee,and  
 squash.
