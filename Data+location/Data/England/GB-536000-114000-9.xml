		<content> It is mainly flat farmland and        
 woodland,surrounded by the South Downs
 .There is a stream running across the 
 area which eventually flows into the  
 river Ouse at Lewes.The railway runs  
 from Lewes through Plumpton village   
 towards Haywards Heath,on the Victoria
 line.There is a lot of watery         
 land,because of the mills.There are   
 many farms,because this is the main   
 industury of the area.The soil is a   
 mixture of chalk and clay.The weald is
 a bed of clay on which little grows   
 except oak trees.The whole area is    
 mostly covered by grass and wheat with
 some woodland.This has some of the    
 best oak trees than any other place in
 Britain.The clay is useful because    
 there were a lot of brickyards around 
 here,which was once the main          
 industry
