		<content>    The population of the block is     
 concentrated at the southern edge, to 
 the north of Coniston, in a part of   
 the village called{Far End.}By        
 counting houses, and estimating three 
 people per house, approximately 50    
 people live in{Far End}and{Lower      
{Yewdale,}and with the outlying farms, 
 a further 30 can be added.            
    The centres of population are      
 firmly sited in the sheltered parts of
 the main valleys, well above river    
 flood levels. The only exceptions are 
 a few cottages on the edge of{Tarn    
{Hows,}overlooking the main valley of  
{Yewdale,}and the{Youth Hostel}in the  
{Coppermines Valley,}which was         
 originally a building associated with 
 mining activity.                      
    Not all of the population can be   
 regarded as permanent, because there  
 are a few holiday homes.              </content>
