		<title>06Education in New Mills</title>
		<content> There is a lot of education in New    
 Mills. There are 6 Primary Schools    
 and a Comprehensive School. We have   
 found out that over the years the     
 Comprehensive School has got bigger   
 (more pupils). Some lessons are Social
 Studies, Typing, Hockey, Netball and  
 Cross Country Running. They were not  
 done a few years ago. We asked an old 
 man what P.E. he did and he answered :
 Skipping, Running and Hopscotch. He   
 didn't wear  a uniform either.He said 
 he just wore a badge with fruit on    
 it.He also said the school  he went to
 had about 200 pupils. We also spoke to
 a teacher and she said jobs were easy 
 to find after she left college.
