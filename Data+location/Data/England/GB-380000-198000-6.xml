		<content>   On the opposite side of the valley  
 there used to be a mature larchwood. A
 'tip' was made the other side of it.  
 Since the trees have been felled the  
 'tip' is visible.                     
   The farmer also acts as a farm      
 adviser to other farmers in the area  
 and to some as far away as Scotland.He
 helps them increase the yield from    
 their crops.                          
   On the farm they have{100}beef      
 cattle,6 sheep and 5 horses.Four of   
 these belong to people in the village 
 of Nympsfield.                        
   He looks after the smallest{triplet 
{sheep}which are given to him by other 
 farmers.The sheep on this farm are    
 'orphans'.When they are a year old    
 they are slaughtered.Some of the meat 
 is used by the farmer,being stored in 
 a freezer until it is needed.
