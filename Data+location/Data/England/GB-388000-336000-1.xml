		<content>  In BARLASTON Meadowcourt provides    
 sheltered council accommodation for   
 about 40 elderly people.There is a    
 warden on duty during the weekand she 
 also visits each person every         
 morning.Until recently there was also 
 an assistant warden to relieve the    
 warden and provide round the clock    
 cover,but the council has now removed 
 this postin an effort to reduce       
 costs,and instead each flat has been  
 fitted with an intercom linked to a   
 central exchange at Stafford.         
 The majority of the flats consist of a
 living room,bedroom,small kitchen and 
 a lavatory with wash basin.The        
 tennants have to take their own       
 furniture and are expected to be able 
 to look after themselves.The system   
 provides the independence and privacy 
 that most old people want with the    
 knowledge that help is close by.      </content>
