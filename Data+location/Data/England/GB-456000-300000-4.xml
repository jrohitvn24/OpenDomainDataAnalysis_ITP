		<title>04TRAFFIC CENSUS (explanation)</title>
		<content>      This traffic census was designed 
 to be simple and yet able to give an  
 over-all view of vehicle movement and 
 vehicle type on the three main trunk  
 roads in our area:-                   
   (1){A50}to Northampton.             
   (2){A426}to Lutterworth &amp; Rugby.    
   (3){A46}to Coventry but the main    
 route to the{M1, M69}&amp;{M6}motorways.  
      The children divided the vehicles
 into just 3 categories:-              
   (a){Private Transport}privately     
 owned cars, cycles and motor cycles.  
   (b){Commercial Transport}vans &amp;     
 lorries with a name or logo of a firm 
 on them, used for carrying goods.     
   (c){Public Transport}buses, coaches,
 taxis &amp; ambulances.                   
      The census was done on a Tuesday 
 between 9.30 and 10.30am and traffic  
 flow was counted both towards and away
 from the city centre.                 </content>
