		<title>04The Castle, Warwick.</title>
		<content>  Warwick Castle is one of the most    
 beautiful and best preserved castles  
 in Britain. It rises steeply from the 
 River Avon and its position was of    
 strategic importance from the earliest
 times. After  375 years of ownership  
 by the Greviille family the castle was
 sold in 1978 to Madame Tussauds of    
 London and is now open to the public  
 every day. The castle as seen today   
 dates mainly from the 14th century    
 built round Ethelfreda's mound which  
 was built by the Normans around 1068. 
 In1264 the castle was sacked by the   
 army of Simon de Montfort and rebuilt 
 in the 14th century by the Beauchamp  
 family. Special points of interest    
 include the State Rooms, the Great    
 Hall, the Armoury, Dungeon and Torture
 Chamber, Historic Towers and the      
 Italian Library. 60 acres of park and 
 woodland are also open to visitors.   </content>
