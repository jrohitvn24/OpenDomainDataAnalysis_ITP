		<content>{Mr. Levi Shepherd}was born in         
 Charlestown on 23rd September 1895. He
 has lived at Fern Villas for 84 years.
 Levi had 11 brothers and sisters but  
 two died young. He went to Mytholm    
 School when he was 5 years old, and   
 wore knickerbockers, woolly socks     
 and jumpers. School cost 2p per week  
 but later went down to a penny. There 
 were 80 children in the school. He    
 played football, cricket, hop skip and
 jump, touch'n'go, marbles and paper   
 chase. He learnt the ABC, subtraction,
 sat at long desks with tip up seats   
 and wrote on a slate with a pencil. He
 left school at 12 yrs old becoming an 
 errand boy at Callis Mill then a      
 weaver, which he disliked, then a     
 jockey and a soldier in the first     
 World war.
