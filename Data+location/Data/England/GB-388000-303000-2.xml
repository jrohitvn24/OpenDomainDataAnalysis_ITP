This is a little bit of information of 
Bilbrook.  Once part of the ancient    
Brewood, forest and resting place for  
John Wesley, this progressive village  
situated on the border of Staffordshire
and Wolverhampton is constantly seeking
to upgrade the facilities available to 
its residents.  The village green on   
the edge of which lies a local inn has 
recently been improved and the modern  
village hall has been extended.  Some  
forty acres of pasture land has been   
acquired and this maintains a green    
belt between the village and the large 
Barnhurst estate currently being       
developed at Pendeford.  The Parish    
Council owned land is earmarked for    
future general public recreational     
purposes and an area has been set aside
for allotments .
