		<title>11A COCKFIELD CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>My name is Benjamin Shotbolt and I live
in Cockfield.On a normal Tuesday I get 
up at about 6.30 a.m..At 7,I have my   
breakfast which is"Frosties" and then I
get ready for school.The next hour I   
spend with my train set.At 8.35,I leave
for school.There are two ways to get to
school and those are by road or by     
footpath.At school there are two bells 
to be rung and I ring them.Then we have
Assembly,which consists of a talk      
first,singing next and last of all a   
prayer.After that we have Maths and    
then the Rector comes to talk to us.   
Break is from 10.30 to 10.45.We have a 
music lesson:this is on the radio and  
is called "Time &amp; Tune".This term's    
songs are about Cowboys and Indians.I  
play a wood block and coconut shells.  
That lasts until 11.20.Then we have    
History until lunch,which is at 12 p.m.
After lunch in the hall,we play to 1.15</content>
