   The{Biggin W.I.}was{reformed in     
{1983/84.}We have a committee of 10    
 which includes a president,secretary  
 and a treasurer. Committee meetings   
 are held at one of the members homes  
 on the 2nd Monday of each month,and   
{monthly meetings}are held in{Biggin   
{Village Hall every third Monday.      
   Several items of business are dealt 
 with at each meeting,but this is only 
 a small part of the proceedings.The   
 main item is the talk,film show or    
 demonstration,which can cover any     
 subject from "Corn Dollies" to "the   
 History of Derbyshire".Many members   
 take part in our monthly competition  
 which is usually based on some craft, 
 and during refreshment time the guest 
 speaker will judge the items and give 
 a small prize.
