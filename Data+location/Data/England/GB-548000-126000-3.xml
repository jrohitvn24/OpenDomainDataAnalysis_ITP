		<content> About 400 people live in the area but 
 only around 50 work within it. Apart  
 from a vineyard and one public house  
 there is no commerce or business. The 
 only work available is either in or   
 connected with agriculture or in the  
 residential institutions which have   
 taken over some of the large houses   
 for use as homes for the elderly or   
 handicapped and in one case a private 
 school. Th majority of people travel  
 to work in nearby large towns or      
 London. A minority of married women   
 work outside their homes. Almost      
 everyone takes it for granted that at 
 least one car is essential and they do
 not therefore find it inconvenient or 
 remote to live here although there are
 no shops, secondary schools or medical
 services within walking distance and  
 virtually no public transport.
