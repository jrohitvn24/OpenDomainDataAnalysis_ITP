		<content>RISBY. Despite its closeness to the    
town the village maintains a distinct  
community life of its own. Amenities   
include the village hall which is well 
used for a range of activities such as 
clubs (see Leisure), the Post Office   
and the Garden and Camping centre. The 
monthly village newsletter indicates   
the existence of many community        
functions many of which are encouraged 
by the new additions to the village,   
who are people whose work and life     
centres on the town but have chosen to 
live in the village because of its     
peaceful country setting and the desire
to be part of a small community. Some  
indicated that they prefer their       
children to attend a village school    
which was close at hand.
