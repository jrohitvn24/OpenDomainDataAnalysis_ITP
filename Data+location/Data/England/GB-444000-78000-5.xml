		<title>05A day in my life by Stephen</title>
		<content> When I get up in the morning my       
 brother has usually gone to school.I  
 have my breakfast which is cereal and 
 toast or an egg and I have some orange
 juice,then I have a wash and clean my 
 teeth and get dressed for school.In   
 the Summer I wear shorts and a tee-   
 shirt and short socks.In winter I wear
 my school uniform.I have a grey jumper
 and long grey or black trousers.My    
 school is nearly three miles away from
 my house because we live right in the 
 country,my mum takes me in the car.The
 school I go to is Chale C.E.Primary.We
 begin school at 9.30am and have       
 lessons until 12.15 Then I have a     
 school dinner it costs 60p a day.After
 dinner we read,do P.E.and sometimes we
 have art and craft.I leave school at  
 3.15pm.When I get home I watch T.V.   
 play with my computer or play in the  
 garden.I have my tea.Then I go to bed.</content>
