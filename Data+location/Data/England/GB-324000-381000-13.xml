		<title>13KINGSCOTE</title>
		<content> Kingscote is the name of an old       
 woodcutter's cottage on Oldfield Road.
 It is ina beautiful setting. The whole
 of the front half has been extended   
 and it has a private wood behind it.  
 There is a boating lake and a quarry  
 in the wood. Both the lake and the    
 quarry are now disused and the nettles
 are growing so high we found it       
 impossible to go in as we were wearing
 shorts. This same area contains the   
 now derilict buildings of Cleaver     
 Hospital.
