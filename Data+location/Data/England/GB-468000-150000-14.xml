 In the south of the study             
 there are                             
 low lying hills which are farmed for  
 crops and pasture land. In the north  
 there are old woodlands which are     
 inhabited by varied wildlife.  Road   
 signs indicate that deer are numerous 
 and several Roe deer were spotted.    
   There are Trout streams fed by the  
 springs and watercress beds are       
 numerous although they are now        
 appearing to fall into disrepair.
