		<content> At Mullion Health Centre there are 3  
 full-time doctors and one trainee     
 doctor who is on a one-year practice. 
 The area Health Authority supplies a  
 midwife,a health visitor and a bath   
 nurse for the elderly. A chiropodist  
 makes a visit every fortnight.Mullion 
 doctors encourage women to have their 
 babies at home, a practice which is   
 discouraged in most areas, where      
 expectant mothers go into hospital.   
 The doctors are willing to extend this
 service to Helston and St.Keverne. The
 practice has surgeries each day except
 Sunday, and there is usually a doctor 
 present should emergency treatment be 
 required.Also there are antenatal and 
 postnatal classes, relaxation         
 classes,parent- craft classes,a baby  
 clinic and a family planning clinic.  
 From April 1984 to April 1985, 24     
 girls and 33 boys were born.          </content>
