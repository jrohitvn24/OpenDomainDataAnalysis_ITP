		<title>12ST.ANDREWS PARK AND TOMB</title>
		<content>{St.Andrew's Park}is in the Parish of {
{St.Helier.}It is used for a play area 
 and has a few climbing frames and     
 swings. In the corner of the park is{ 
{St.Andrew's Church.}The park and the  
 church were dedicated to St. Andrew, a
 poor fisherman. The park and church   
 were first built because of a seamen's
 mission. They were started in 1850 and
 completed in 1854.                    
 Ships needing ballast used to send    
 carts to the dunes for sand. One day  
 in {1865,}while sand was being taken, 
 some {stones}were uncovered.          
 Archaeologists later recognised these 
 as parts of a {prehistoric tomb.}They 
 were not fully uncovered until 1883,  
 but now you can see them in{St.       
{Andrew's Park.}They were proved to be 
{two tombs}of entirely different       
 types.
