		<content>The houses in this are vary in age from
the 16th century to the 20th century.  
                                       
The majority of the older houses are   
situated in the heart of the town,     
along College Street and the Market    
Square. Many of these houses are listed
buildings, including Grade 2 category  
and cannot be altered without          
permission the Department of the       
Environment. These mellow limestone    
houses give an old world appearance to 
the main part of the town.             
                                       
Behind this old facade exists modern   
housing estates of detached and semi-  
detached houses including some inter-  
war Council houses.
