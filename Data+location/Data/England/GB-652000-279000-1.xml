		<content> A small cluster of houses round the   
 wins of a large medieval church.      
 Within the wins stands a small that   
 ched church built in 1672 and still in
 use though the population is now only 
 36 souls.  The land is arable and     
 marsh and the population is largely   
 involved in farming.  There are also  
 two game-keepers.  The sea is eroding 
 the coast here at the rate off        
 approximately 10 metres each year and 
 is assumed that the houses wind the   
 church and the church itself will all 
 be taken in the next 75 years.  The   
 marshes are a haven for wild-fowl,    
 marsh barriers and bittern and the    
 reeds are are cut for thatching.  All 
 the land and houses are in the        
 ownership of one family as they have  
 been for over 230 years.
