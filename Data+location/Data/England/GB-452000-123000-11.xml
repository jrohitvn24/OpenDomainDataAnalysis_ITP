		<title>11LONGWOOD HOUSE II</title>
		<content>    The house then became the property 
 of the Earl of Eldan and was visited  
 by Queen Elizabeth II and Princess    
 Margaret when they were children.     
    The house was lived in until the   
 beginning of the Second World War when
 the Earl of Eldan sold the property,  
 which was then occupied by American   
 soldiers. After the war the house was 
 no longer used and subsequently fell  
 into disrepair.                       
    The ruins of the house have        
 recently been removed in order to make
 way for the land to be used for       
 farming.
