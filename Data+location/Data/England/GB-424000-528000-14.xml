		<title>14St. JOSEPHS R.C. CHURCH</title>
		<content> The builders began the church in      
 November 1932 and it was completed in 
 January 1934. The cost was just over  
 Â£7500. The foundations needed to be   
 built on a reinforced concrete beam.  
 The parish used to come to our school 
 to attend mass from 1907 until 1934.  
 We have stained glass windows. There  
 are four on the left hand side and    
 three above the altar. There is a     
 statue of St. Joseph above the        
 entrance. The stained glass windows   
 came from an old church in Barnard    
 Castle. In 1948 our church had a      
 marble floor and walls put into the   
 sanctuary. In 1984 the church         
 celebrated it's Golden Jubilee and the
 school children bought a golden plaque
 which is now on a lecturn in the      
 sanctuary.
