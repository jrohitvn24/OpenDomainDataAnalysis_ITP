 ...For Mr. Trevethan and his family,  
 farming is an enjoyable life; Penponds
 Farm is an ideal size for 1 man with  
 his family.                           
      Mr. Trevethan benefits from      
 employing some of the latest farm     
 techniques as it makes it possible for
 him to forecast yields reliably and   
 thus keep with the fairly stable      
 prices. He also benefits from the     
 E.E.C. policies which, in general,    
 uplift dairy farmers.                 
      Turning his mind to future       
 development, Mr. Trevethan hopes to   
 replace some old buildings in his farm
 with new cattle housing, and he is    
 closely watching the farming scene for
 any new improved methods of farming   
 that might help his productivity on   
 the farm.                             
                                       </content>
