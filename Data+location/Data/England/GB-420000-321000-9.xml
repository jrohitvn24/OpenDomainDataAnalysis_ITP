		<title>09A CATHOLIC FAMILY'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content>   The Cafferkeys, with  five children 
under 13, are all born Catholics,who   
attend Mass every Sunday and Holyday   
from the age of only 2 weeks.          
   For Mrs.Cafferkey Sunday has always 
been a special day.The children dress  
in special clothes, and fast for an    
hour before Mass.They can hear other   
children playing outside,but must stay 
in until Mass-time to keep tidy.Their  
parents give them money for the church 
collection, or to light a candle for   
the sick.                              
   After Mass, it is a family day, with
Grandma coming to tea, or themselves   
visiting relations. At times of special
need they have family prayers.         
   Mr.&amp; Mrs.Cafferkey remember when    
Sunday was much harder, with fasting   
from midnight, and long Masses all in  
Latin. Even now Mrs.Cafferkey sometimes
resents the duties when she is tired.  </content>
