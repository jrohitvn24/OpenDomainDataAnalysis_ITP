		<title>04The Garden, Stoke-sub-Hamdon</title>
		<content>    Mrs.Beaumont's garden is behind the
 Primary School. It's so interesting   
 because there are so many beautiful   
 thing there. When we visited we saw   
 lots of flowers, shrubs , fossiles and
 wildlife. There is an old water pump  
 and a dogs grave. A tree had grown    
 over a stump of tree which had been   
 used as a seat.  There were tables,   
 chairs and benches. There was a pond  
 but it does not hold water any more.  
 They made a hole in the bottom of it  
 because the hedge-hogs kept drowning  
 in the water. The garden is so        
 interesting that recently television  
 cameras have gone there to film.      
    When Mrs.Beaumont was a little girl
 she had a big garden. She had always  
 wanted a big garden herself, so that's
 why she put lots of shrubs and flowers
 in it.
