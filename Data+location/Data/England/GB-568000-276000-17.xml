		<title>17 Local Events</title>
		<content> Many of the local activities take     
place in the existing Village Hall in  
Beck Row, but about five years ago, a  
Comminuty Association was formed to    
raise funds for a new Community Centre.
Sufficient money has now been raised to
consider making plans for building     
either on the existing site or on a    
Parish Playground behind the School.   
 Jumble Sales, Bring and Buy Sales,    
Discos and other fund raising events   
are held in the Village Hall by various
local organisations. The Over 60's Club
meets regularly and organises          
activities and events for the elderly  
and there is a Women's Institute that  
does much good work in raising funds   
for charity as well as providing       
interesting meetings for the ladies of 
the area.The Football Club has its own 
pitch on part of The Close near to the 
proposed site of the Community Centre. </content>
