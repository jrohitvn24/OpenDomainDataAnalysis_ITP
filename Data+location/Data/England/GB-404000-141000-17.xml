		<title>17THE VILLAGE OF SHREWTON</title>
		<content> It is likely that the area around     
 Shrewton and Orcheston has been       
 inhabited for almost 3000 years.      
 Stonehenge,which is 4 miles to the    
 east,and numerous burial mounds are   
 evidence to support this.             
  The name Shrewton is derived from    
 "Winterbourne Shreveton" which means  
 "the sheriff's settlement by the      
 winterbourne stream".In the late      
 medieval times the name became        
 Shrewton. The Hollow is a road in the 
 village,its name has evolved from     
 "Hlaew",meaning graveyard. Several    
 years ago a sixth century Anglo-Saxon 
 grave was excavated there and it is   
 thought there are other such graves   
 nearby.                               
  Mill House and Mill Lane remind us   
 that there once was a windmill in the 
 village.
