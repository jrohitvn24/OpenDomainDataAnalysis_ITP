		<title>04Landscape of Itchenor area</title>
		<content>  The land is very flat, only rising to
 13 ft. above sea level on Thorney     
 which is hedged fields of crops and   
 grassland with a few stunted trees,   
 the mile wide promontory being        
 surrounded on three sides by areas of 
 marshland at low tide. The end of the 
 runway of the old airfield lies in the
 N. There are no buildings.            
  The mainland rises to 23ft. in S. and
 is mainly agricultural, the greater   
 part being farmed by Itchenor Park.   
 There is a "rife" or very small stream
 that flows past the church and there  
 are pockets of woodland, the largest  
 near Chalkdock Point and Itchenor     
 House but there many tall field       
 hedges. The areas of housing are at   
 Itchenor, Rookwood, Malthouse         
 Cottages, Redlands and Chapel Lanes,  
 and along the main road.
