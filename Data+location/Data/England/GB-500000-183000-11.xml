		<title>11LIVING IN IVER HEATH</title>
		<content>                                       
 My name is Sophie Lambert,I have been 
 living in Iver Heath for just over one
 year.I used to live in Uxbridge,about 
 5 minutes walk to the town,but as     
 there are not many shops in Iver Heath
 at first I missed them,but now I'm    
 getting used to it.  In Iver Heath    
 there are  a lot of acres of just     
 grassland,so maybe in 20 years the    
 grassland will be made into a town.   
   Traffic comes thundering through    
 Iver Heath to get to the Denham       
 roundabout.                           
   Most days of the week there are     
 traffic jams,but soon it won't be so  
 noisy,as at the moment we are waiting 
 for the M25 to be built.              
    It was scheduled to be opened in   
 July,but I think most probably it     
 won't be opened until September.
