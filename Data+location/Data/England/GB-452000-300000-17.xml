		<content> Houses built in the early 1960's were 
 largely for working/middle class      
 famillies. The houses that have been  
 built more recently are more expensive
 and the 'executive' type.             
 The size of nuclear famillies varies  
 from 3 to 6, whilst most famillies    
 have either 2 or 3 children. Nearly   
 every family has a car whilsy 10% have
 two cars; in most famillies both      
 parents work whilst unelpoyment in the
 area seems to be fairly low. Most     
 people have some form of summer       
 holiday and the type varies from      
 self-catering and chaletc and camping 
 to hotels. Self-catering appears to   
 be the most popular type of holiday.
