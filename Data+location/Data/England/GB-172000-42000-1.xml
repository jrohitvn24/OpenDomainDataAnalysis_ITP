		<content>  The area includes the villages of {  
{St.Day}and{Chacewater}and many        
 hamlets.All have strong connections   
 with the 19th Century mining boom.The 
 block contains what was once the      
 richest square mile{in the world,     
{because of its copper mines.}This     
 recent past influences the region     
 today and is  reflected in many place 
 names beginning with{"wheal"}which in 
 the Cornish Language means{"mine".    
 Many acres of mine waste are now      
 covered with gorse and heath.Also     
 there are many {mine shafts,}now been 
 capped                                
 .Using modern methods mine waste is   
 being reprocessed and more tin        
 extracted. Because of this some       
{conservation and restoration}has taken
 place.Many fields in the area have    
 been recovered from mine operations   
 .About 60% of the block is pasture.   </content>
