		<content> In and around Thorner, along the 'B'  
 roads, traffic was very light with    
 less than 100 vehicles per hour       
 passing along Main Street. The vast   
 majority of vehicles were private     
 motor cars.                           
                                       
 The A64 York Road links Leeds with the
 A1 road. Traffic was heavy with well  
 over 1000 vehicles per hour,          
 increasing at peak times.             
 The majority of vehicles were private 
 cars and lorries. It is also a main   
 bus route.                            
                                       
 On the A64 and the surrounding minor  
 roads there were several farm vehicles
 moving between fields and farms, as   
 may be expected in an area used       
 predominantly for farming.
