		<title>01Introduction to the area</title>
		<content>The area lies on either side of the    
valley of the Dove, which crosses it   
diagonally from the N.E. to the S.W.   
The river is the county boundary       
between Derbyshire and Staffordshire.  
  The disused Buxton-Uttoxeter railway 
line follows the valley, mainly on the 
Derbyshire side.                       
  This agricultural area is almost     
entirely grassland, largely dairy but  
with some sheep, particularly where the
ground rises in Staffordshire.         
  The villages in the area are the     
scattered community of Norbury and the 
compact village of Snelston.  Snelston 
lies in a secluded side valley south of
the Dove.  Across the river lies the   
parts of Mayfield called Middle        
Mayfield and Church Mayfield.  The area
is famous for the author of "Adam      
Bede", George Elliott whose parents are
buried at Norbury.                     </content>
