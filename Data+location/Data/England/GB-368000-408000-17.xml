		<title>17THE COMMUNITY POLICEMAN.</title>
		<content>   P.C.Stubbs, our local community     
 policeman,is one of six community     
 policemen who work in Bolton.Each has 
 his own beat which is about 1km wide  
 and 2km long.Each beat is around the  
 town centre stretching out into those 
 areas where many people live.Each     
 community policeman walks his beat    
 getting to know the people who live   
 there so that they will trust him as a
 friend.Policemen work eight hour      
 shifts;usually the hours are          
 7am-3pm,3pm-11pm and 11pm-7am. The    
 community policeman does not usually  
 work a night shift and can alter his  
 shift to suit what is happening in his
 area.When the community policeman is  
 off duty, his beat is covered by      
 officers in a patrol car. The         
 community policeman is always in radio
 contact with the police station and   
 can ask for assistance if he needs it.</content>
