		<content> The {daily routine}of Paul,aged       
 11.6yrs.                              
 I get up at 7.30am and have cereals   
 for breakfast.My mum comes down with  
 our baby and feeds her.At about 8.30  
 my other sister comes in from the     
 paper round and has her breakfast.I   
 go and get dressed and at 8.30am I go 
 to school.My dad works on shifts so   
 the time he gets up can vary.         
 School starts at 9am,it takes 5       
 minutes to walk there.                
 If dad's working we have a snack for  
 lunch.At 12.40pm I go back to school  
 and usually have a game of            
 football.School starts at 1.15pm and  
 ends at 3.30pm .I arrive home at      
 3.40pm and watch 'Children's ITV' then
 at 5.15pm we have tea.                
 At night I watch television.
