		<title>13BRITAINS RAILWAYS</title>
		<content> Britains Railways are now getting old.
 So in 1982 British Rail launched a Â£40
 millon modernisation plan.            
 This included rebuilding stations and 
 new trains.Most of todays railways    
 are now mainly electrified, except    
 Branch lines which still use Diesel   
 Multiple Units.British Rail owns over 
 7,100,000 miles of track over Britain 
 and Ireland.The line which runs       
 through Hockley is served by the more 
 economical Electric Multiple Units.   
 The newer models have sliding doors   
 which open and close at the touch of a
 button.Signalling is mainly Multiple  
 Aspect Signals.Old semaphores are     
 still used but only on Branch Lines   
 and Steam museums.Todays Railways are 
 criticized for not being on time.But  
 like the Beeching Report in 1960      
 British Rail are still losing money   
 and closing Railways.                 </content>
