 The life style of the population in   
 this area is basically simple that is 
 to say the lack of general amenities  
 does not seem to worry too many of the
 inhabitants and on the whole it is    
 only newcomers to the area, of which  
 there are comparatively few who worry 
 about not having all the services such
 as main drainage and trains nearby    
 Most people were happy with a bus     
 service which passed the door only    
 twice a day and people with buses four
 times a day thought that was extremely
 good                                  
 Most people seemed to be quite        
 prepared and able to drive to the     
 nearest town some 10 miles distant for
 anything they required other than the 
 basics which were sold in the village 
 shop                                  
 Train services were 5 miles distant   </content>
