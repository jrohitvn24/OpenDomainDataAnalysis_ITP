		<content> The local river, the river Pang,      
 provides water for the occupants of   
 our area. The Thames Water Authority  
 pumps up millions of tonnes of water  
 all the time, this is used in the     
 Thames Valley. The reason it is       
 pumped, is because the area is over a 
 huge artesian well. The actual Pang,  
 above ground, has less water than it  
 used to have. In our area there are 2 
 windpumps (497768 and 483753). The    
 water from some houses comes straight 
 from under ground, as far as 350 feet.
     The lowering of the water table   
 has just about ceased flooding except 
 after a very bad winter. However in   
 1984 the Pang ceased flowing for      
 several months.                       
     The river Pang also provides many 
 beauty spots  for tourists and water  
 at hand.
