		<content> There are some{families with several  
{generations}living in proximity, but  
 the trend is for outsiders to move    
 into the region.  Since the closure of
 the shop and Post Office, facilities  
 are limited to mobile units or road-  
 side stalls selling farm produce. Most
 families make weekly or monthly{shop- 
{ping}trips to supermarkets in the     
 nearby towns. In this area,{food}is   
 cooked mainly by electricity, and most
{family meals}are taken in the evening.
{Milk}is delivered daily;{refuse}is    
 collected weekly (in plastic bags);the
 postlady delivers{mail}by bicycle.    
 Many{homes}are centrally heated &amp; well
 furnished with telephones connected.  
 In most, music is played, television  
 watched, newspapers &amp; books read, and,
 in some, school work attempted. A good
 proportion of local families own{pets,
 and dogs are exercised along the lanes</content>
