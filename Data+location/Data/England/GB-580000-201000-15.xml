 people we spoke to owned a car. This  
 is essential as there is only a       
 limited bus service serving the area. 
 Only one bus a day is routed through  
 Cock Clarks and many residents felt   
 that the route should be changed      
 because it is inconvenient.           
   There is a private "bus service" run
 by a resident of Cock Clarks which is 
 popular due to its flexibility.       
   Hazeleigh garage is on the site of  
 the old White Hart pub which used to  
 have a petrol pump outside but which  
 was closed down during the Second     
 World War.
