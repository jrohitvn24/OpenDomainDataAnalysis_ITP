		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> MY DAY STARTS AT 8 O'CLOCK WHEN MY    
 ALARM CLOCK WAKES ME UP. I GET DRESSED
 IN MY SCHOOL UNIFORM OF BLOUSE, SKIRT 
 AND JUMPER. THE MAIN COLOUR IS NAVY   
 BLUE BUT WE CAN WEAR GREY AS WELL. I  
 GO DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE A BOWL OF      
 CEREAL AND A CUP OF TEA THEN I BRUSH  
 MY TEETH AND WASH MY FACE. MY MUM PUTS
 MY HAIR IN A PONYTAIL THEN I GET ALL  
 MY THINGS TOGETHER AND GO TO SCHOOL.  
 SCHOOL IS FROM 9.15a.m. UNTIL 3.15p.m.
 WITH A 15 MINUTE BREAK DURING THE     
 MORNING AND AN HOUR FOR LUNCH AT      
 12.15p.m. I TAKE SANDWICHES FOR LUNCH 
 BUT SOME OF MY FRIENDS HAVE A SCHOOL  
 DINNER. AFTER SCHOOL I GO HOME AND    
 WATCH TELEVISION UNTIL 6p.m.WHEN I    
 HAVE MY TEA OF PERHAPS SAUSAGES AND   
 JACKET POTATOES. AFTER TEA I PLAY     
 OUTSIDE UNTIL IT GETS DARK THEN I GO  
 INDOORS AND WATCH TELEVISION UNTIL    
 8.45p.m. WHEN I GO TO BED.            </content>
