		<title>04Guides float "Flame" on raft</title>
		<content>On Friday June 28th 1985 those Guides  
in our company who were allowed to stay
out until 11.00pm met Chil at St Pauls 
Hall, Bretch Hill Banbury. From there  
we walked in the rain to the brook near
the Wroxton Abbey estate below the     
Folly. The Rangers were already there. 
They had lit a fire and were baking    
jacket potatoes. We ate these while the
beefburgers were cooking.              
After a drink we went into the woods   
and sat around the "Flame" and sang    
campfire songs. When this was over two 
people were enrolled into the Guides.  
They had to say the Guides promise and 
were given their badge.                
After the enrollment Chil lit candles  
in each patrol leaders tin-foil raft.  
These were then put into the brook and 
they floated away with their candles   
burning. When the lights had gone out  
we cleared up and returned home.       </content>
