		<title>17DUCKS ON THE STREAM IN SHERE</title>
		<content>   We are unsure how many ducks there  
 are. We think there are 12 altogether.
 James said one white duck got killed  
 by a fox and four got run over by     
 cars. The white ducks live behind a   
 bush near the allotments. The brown   
 ducks live behind the pottery where   
 they lay their eggs. People who come  
 to Shere village in cars or by coach  
 often have to stop by the bridge,     
 which crosses over the Tillingbourne  
 river in Middle Street, to let the    
 ducks cross over the road.  The ducks 
 are often seen on the stream. Jeremy  
 has seen them in Gomshall. They leave 
 the stream and wander all around the  
 village. Joanne,who lives in Orchard  
 Road,once saw a white one,he followed 
 her up her road and she gave him some 
 bread. Many villagers feed the ducks  
 regularly by the bridge.
