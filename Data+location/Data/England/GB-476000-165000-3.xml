		<content> Along the Barkham ride,a firm is      
 building a new estate with almost 100 
 houses being built in the price range 
 of 50-70 thousand pounds.Opposite this
 estate another building firm has just 
 finished building another estate so   
 the area has been develloped a good   
 deal more.                            
                                       
 Late last year the council decided to 
 build a roundabout where Barkham ride 
 met Finchamstead road. This was       
 because there had been two accidents  
 and the people going from Barkham ride
 onto Finchamstead road somtimes had to
 wait 10 minutes to get onto the       
 road.It took quite a lot of time to   
 get it finished but it has improved   
 the traffic a great deal. Along       
 Barkham ride there has been a spate of
 burglaries lately.                    
                                       </content>
