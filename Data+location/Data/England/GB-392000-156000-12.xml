		<title>12HEALTH - SOCIAL WELFARE</title>
		<content> My day to day life is extremely busy  
 and fulfilling. I am a farmer's wife  
 with twin boys and a girl. I run the  
 local Twins Club which aims to give   
 emotional and practical support to    
 parents of twins. Monthly meetings are
 held to discuss and give advice on the
 joys and difficulties of coping with  
 and bringing up twins. My husband and 
 I are Registered Foster Parents taking
 children referred by the Social       
 Services for short stays - this work  
 is very rewarding and enjoyable. I am 
 also a Team Attached Volunteer which  
 involves working closely with social  
 workers and visiting young families   
 with problems and befriending them. I 
 run the Babysitting Circle in our area
 About 25 families belong and we use a 
 ticket system of repayment so no money
 is involved. I take my daughter to    
 the Keevil Toddler Group once a week. </content>
