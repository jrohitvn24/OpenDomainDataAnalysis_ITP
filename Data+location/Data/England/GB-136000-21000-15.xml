		<title>15St. Levan Church - Legends</title>
		<content> The bench ends are a distinct feature 
 of the church. One shows{two fish on  
{one hook.}Selevan caught them like    
 this twice but threw them back. Next  
 time, thinking it a{good omen,}he gave
 them to his sister from Breage, for   
 her children's tea, but{they choked to
{death thus proving it a curse....     
 On the south side of the church quite 
 near the porch, is a rock known as{St.
{Levan's Stone. }It is broken in two,  
 and it was said that Selevan sat upon 
 this rock when he tired from fishing. 
 One day, wishing to leave{a memento of
 himself in connection with{his}rude   
 but{favourite seat,}he gave it a blow 
 with his hand and cracked it through. 
 He prayed and uttered the prophecy:   
{       When with panniers astride,    
{       A pack horse can ride,         
{       Through Selevan's Stone,       
{       The world will be done....'}   </content>
