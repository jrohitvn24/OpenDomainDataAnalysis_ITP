		<content> FIRWOOD FARM IN HOGHTON               
 THE FARM IS ABOUT 200 YEARS OLD AND   
 WAS OWNED BY THE DE HOGHTON FAMILY.   
 THE PRESENT OWNERS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR
 30 YEARS                              
 THE FARM COVERS ABOUT 50 ACRES AND IS 
 A DAIRY FARM.  MOST OF THE COWS ARE   
 FRIESIANS AND THE MILK IS SENT TO THE 
 MILK MARKETING BOARD AT BAMBER BRIDGE.
  MUCH MORE MILK IS PRODUCED IN THE    
 SUMMER WHEN THE COWS ARE OUT TO GRASS.
  THE FARMER'S DAY BEGINS AT 6.30 A.M. 
 AND ENDS AT 7.00 P.M.
