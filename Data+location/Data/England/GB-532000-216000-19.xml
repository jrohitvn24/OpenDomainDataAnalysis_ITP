		<title>19TRANSPORT in WADESMILL</title>
		<content>The main road,the A10 follows the line 
of Ermine Street, the Roman Road built 
from London to Lincoln. It passes      
through the villages of Wadesmill and  
Thundridge and separates one half of   
each village from the other. The volume
and speed of the traffic using this    
road in both directions makes crossing 
the road extremely hazardous especially
as there are no crossings or traffic   
lights. A survey done for one hour on a
week day morning showed 519 vehicles   
going towards Cambridge and 469 towards
London. At peak times in the morning   
and evening when commuters are         
travelling the traffic is even heavier.
However a massive thirteen million     
pound bypass for Wadesmill has now been
announced. The local vicar says this   
will give the villages a proper sense  
of identity and development. It is     
hoped to start building in 1989.       </content>
