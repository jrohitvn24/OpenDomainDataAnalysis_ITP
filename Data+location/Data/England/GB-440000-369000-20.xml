		<title>20NUM STRIKE</title>
		<content> Ours is a typical village of 350      
 people.Only 26 are miners.We shall    
 never forget March 12,1984 when the   
 Yorkshire pickets came and brought our
 pit to a standstill .The womens role  
 was to form support groups.I marvel   
 how well the children came out of     
 it.Sometimes the village looked like a
 gangster film.Our strike centre was   
 the Miners welfare.We gave out food   
 parcels and helped with the mens      
 problems.Our pit was solid for 10     
 months then some men went back to     
 work.We showed no violence towards    
 these men,people just stopped talking 
 to them.They walked round with their  
 heads down. The children never stopped
 playing together.Our  pit was         
 doomed anyway.It has only 4 years left
 now.The strike is over.Now we must    
 learn to live in harmony.It will take 
 time but I know we will succeed.      </content>
