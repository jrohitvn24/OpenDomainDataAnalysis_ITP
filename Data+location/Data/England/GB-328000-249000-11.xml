		<title>11DAIRY FARMING NEAR EARDISLEY</title>
		<content> We have got lots of animals including 
 chickens,cows,lambs,sheep,calves,     
 ponies and lots of other small pets.  
 Life on a dairy farm is difficult now 
 quotas are in. The quota is something 
 the government tells all British      
 farmers how much milk they can        
 produce.If you produce too much or too
 little the farmer gets fined  a lot of
 money.To stop this happening farmers  
 have had to sell many cows so they do 
 not get a good price for their        
 animals.Many farmers are going        
 bankrupt.We have around 32 Fresian    
 cows.Some of them are dry in the      
 summer which means they cannot be     
 milked as they are saving their milk  
 for their calf.Sometimes we help our  
 Dad to milk.The milk is put into a    
 cooling tank until it is collected by 
 a big tanker every morning and taken  
 to a chocolate factory in Leominster. </content>
