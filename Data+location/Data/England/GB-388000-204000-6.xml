		<content> Most of the buildings in this village 
 are build of Cotswold stone.  The     
 majority of them are old. The Church  
 of All Saints was restored in 1862 to 
 its present Victorian look. At the    
 time Roman, Saxon and Norman remains  
 were found and incorporated into the  
 present building. It has a spire      
 topped by a weathervane. The church is
 surrounded by a large graveyard which 
 ends at a lychgate.  On the west side 
 of it are two large houses."Overcourt"
 dates back to Tudor times and is      
 reputed to have housed Elizabeth I as 
 a girl for a short time."Jane's Court"
 next door was remodelled in the 18th  
 Century.  It has an unusual large     
 circular building in the grounds which
 was once a cock-pit. "The Bear Inn"   
 which was built in the17th century was
 once the court house and nearby is a  
 lock-up used for overnight offenders. </content>
