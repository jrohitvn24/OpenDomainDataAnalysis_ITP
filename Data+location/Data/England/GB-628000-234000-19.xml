		<title>19The Water Tower at Trimley</title>
		<content>    The water tower has been here since
  1930 and holds up to{3,000,000       
 gallons of water which come from the  
 reservoirs at{Bucklesham}and Alton    
 Waters.It travels along pipes until it
 reaches the tower and pressure pumps  
 it to the top where it is stored until
 it's ready to be used.The Water tower 
 is{132ft}high and built of steel      
 covered in concrete.It must be taller 
 than every building in the area to    
 provide enough pressure to pump it to 
 the top. The tower has once gone dry  
 because salt water got in and they had
 to drain it out. The tower was built  
 in Trimley St.Mary because it is the  
 most level part and now is owned by   
{The Anglian Water Authority.}The tower
 is painted red and white which makes  
 it a landmark for ships out in the    
 North Sea.{Trinity House}requested    
 a  flood warning system on the roof.  </content>
