		<title>15Bloomfield Garden Centre</title>
		<content>    Garden centres are very popular in 
 and around Colchester because there   
 are so many people who own their own  
 homes.                                
   Bloomfield Garden Centre is on      
 Berechurch Hall Road,opposite         
 Camulodunum Way.Previously it was     
 owned by private families,but the     
 bungalow with five acres of land was  
 built in 1931 for Mr. Ashcroft,a      
 disabled man who was in a wheelchair. 
   He ran it as a smallholding from    
 1931 to 1946 and then sold up and went
 to Canada.                            
   The land was split up and now there 
 is only three quarters of an acre with
 the bungalow.                         
   Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield opened it as
 a garden centre in 1967 and have been 
 running it ever since.
