 was established in July 1968.         
 It was provided by the Lytham St.Annes
 Borough Council with the assistance of
 the Lancashire County Council and the 
 Nature Conservancy.                   
 The Warden-Naturalist looks after the 
 Reserve. He helps the general public  
 and school parties to understand and  
 enjoy the Reserve.                    
 The Reserve is completely open and an 
 area rich in education.               
               The Reserve is made up  
 of a series of irregular hills and    
 hollows.Thirty to forty years ago sand
 was dug out and sold for building.On  
 top of the dunes Marram grass can be  
 seen.                                 
 After it has rained the peat under the
 dunes becomes waterlogged,Gulls rest  
 and bathe in the freshwater.Water     
 Crowfoot flowers can be seen in May.  </content>
