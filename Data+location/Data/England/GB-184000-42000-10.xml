		<title>10Typical Cornish Food</title>
		<content> The Cornish pasty is probably the most
 famous of all Cornish dishes and it   
 has a long history.For hundreds of    
 years Cornishmen have worked down     
 mines and in that time their wives    
 have developed the art of making      
 pasties.At one time the pasty         
 consisting of meat, potatoes and      
 turnips would be put in one end of a  
 roll of pastry.At the other end their 
 wives would put jam and then cook it  
 all together.In this way the miners   
 would have their dinner and pudding in
 a convenient, eatable                 
 container.Nowadays pasties do not     
 contain jam at one end.There is a     
 saying in Cornwall that you could tell
 the quality of a pasty by what        
 happened to iy when it was dropped    
 down a mine shaft.If it smashed it was
 poor;if it bounced it was a real      
 Cornish pasty.                        </content>
