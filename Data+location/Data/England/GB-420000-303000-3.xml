 Mr and Mrs Kingslake live and work at 
{Whitegates Farm}. They grow soft fruit
such as strawberries, gooseberries and 
raspberries. They let a man keep bees  
on the farm because the bees pollenate 
the soft fruit. Mr Kingslake has a     
balloon to advertise the farm. They    
also advertise on signposts and in the 
local press. He is only supposed to fly
the balloon on Saturdays and Sundays.  
There are several different kinds of   
strawberry on the twenty-two acres. The
most popular is called Cambridge       
Favourite. Another kind is Totem which 
is very good for freezing.             
 The land in the three squares         
04220304, 04220305 and 04230305 is     
generally flat but rising to the north.
It belongs to {Amington Old Hall Farm} 
and is used mainly for growing crops.
