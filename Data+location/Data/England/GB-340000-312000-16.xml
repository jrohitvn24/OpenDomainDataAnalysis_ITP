		<title>16TRANSPORT IN FORD</title>
		<content>   The A458 road joining Welshpool to  
 Shrewsbury is the major link between  
 Ford and the surrounding area.There   
 are a number of small lanes leading to
 other small villages. Most people use 
 a car for work, shopping or pleasure  
 as these are all carried out far from 
 Ford.The railway line was disbanded in
 1933.                                 
   A Bus service passes through Ford   
 along a route connecting the two major
 towns. A school bus takes pupils aged 
 11 years and over to Pontesbury.      
   Many people possess bicycles,useful 
 for local travel.                     
   In the past the River Severn was    
 used to transport fleeces and other   
 goods .Now it is has a restricted     
 passage to Shrewsbury and is used only
 for pleasure boats, canoeing etc.
