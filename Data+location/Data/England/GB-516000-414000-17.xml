		<title>17Beacock's Farm (cont)</title>
		<content> Over the last ten years, Machines have
 taken over many jobs and the use of   
 chemicals to destroy pests and feed   
 the crops has increased.              
 Since Britain joined the E.E.C. the   
 market for the farm's crops has       
 increased. Oil seed rape is the most  
 profitable crop. The biggest expense  
 on the farm is the buying of new      
 machinery and the repair of the       
 old.The farm's worst enemies are pests
 and weeds.                            
 Mr. Beacock does not think Immingham  
 is the best place for a farm because  
 of the pollution from the factories on
 the Humber Bank and the fact that     
 there are so many houses surrounding  
 his land.
