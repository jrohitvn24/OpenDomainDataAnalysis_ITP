		<title>04Inside a house</title>
		<content> My house is quite fashionable. In the 
living room we have a beige, woollen   
carpet, a brown dralon three-piece     
suite, a chipboard wall unit, a new    
hi-fi system (chipboard with sliding   
glass doors), and a colour television. 
 We eat in the dining room. We have an 
oak table which usually seats six but  
can open out to fit sixteen around it. 
 In the kitchen we have a microwave    
oven, a washing machine, a tumble drier
a food mixer, an electric oven (with   
rings) and wall units of green melamine
 In my parents bedroom one wall has    
built-in, wooden wardrobes and drawers.
There is a double bed. In my room I    
have a single bed and a fitted wardrobe
My baby sister has a wooden cot and a  
changing unit in there too. My brother 
has a white cabin bed in his room with 
a desk and drawers underneath the bed. 
 Our rooms are apricot,green and pink  </content>
