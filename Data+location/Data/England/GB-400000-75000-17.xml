		<title>17Durlston Bay Area</title>
		<content>      This area south of the town of   
 Swanage, sits on a chalk and          
 sandstone ridge. It is mainly         
 residential. There are small hotels   
 and guest houses too. Many of the     
 houses are large and detached with    
 considerable grounds, which are       
 beautifully kept. Some are newly built
 of stone these are in the main        
 bungalows.                            
      Towards Durlston Bay there is    
 erosion of the cliff and several      
 buildings have fallen into the sea.   
      A regular bus service provides   
 public transport from the town of     
 Swanage to this area; although private
 cars are the most common form of      
 transport.
