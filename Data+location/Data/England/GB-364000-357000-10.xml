		<title>10BUILDINGS IN ASTON-J-MONDRUM</title>
		<content> Apart from the traditional Cheshire   
 farmhouses,the{residential dwellings  
 in the area include a number of semi- 
 detached houses,dating from Victorian 
 times to the 1950's,which have often  
 been extensively renovated.There are  
 also several{bungalows built close to 
{farmhouses}in mid 20th century,to     
 which the farmers have retired when   
 their children have taken over the    
 running of the farms. There are{no    
{council houses}in Aston-juxta-Mondrum,
 and the majority of houses are owner- 
 occupied,usually with the help of a   
 mortgage. Other buildings include a   
{War Memorial},commemorating those     
 soldiers from Minshull Vernon who died
 in the 1914-18 World War. In the South
 of the region is a{sewage works       
 covering about 5 acres. There also    
 remains a lock-keepers cottage, now   
 a private residence                   </content>
