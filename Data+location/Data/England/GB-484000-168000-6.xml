		<content> Popes Manor was built around 1700 for 
 the father of the poet Alexander Pope 
 He wrote many of his poems in the     
 garden.The original building was a    
 small cottage.Over the years additions
 were made by different owners.In      
 recent years it had become derelict,  
 but in 1984 Bryants the builders      
 bought it to use as head office.They  
 have restored it to its Georgian      
 glory.                                
    The company has given part of the  
 ground to Bracknell District Council, 
 who have opened it up as a park called
 Popes Meadow and as a playing field   
 for St Marks school.In Popes Meadow   
 there is a copse,a pond and a meadow. 
 The copse is mainly holly,hawthorne,  
 oak and hazel.In the unpolluted pond  
 are found many tiny creatures such as 
 freshwater shrimps,mayfly and caddis  
 fly larvas.Foxes and rabbits live here</content>
