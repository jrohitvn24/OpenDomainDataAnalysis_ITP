  The ecology of the area has changed  
 little over the years.In recent years 
 some grubbing out of hedges has       
 occured,but due to the heavy soil     
 there is little danger of erosion.Many
 of the fields are bordered with       
 drystone walls of Cornbrash and       
 support,together with attendant       
 verges, a fair ammount of plant growth
 and make a good habitat for insects   
 and small mammals.                    
  The Wiltshire Trust for Nature       
 Conservation is,at present,involved in
 a habitat mapping scheme of the area. 
  Pheasants are plentiful as are       
 foxes,while bats inhabit the old      
 quarry workings.Rabbits and other     
 small rodents and one would assume    
 badgers are present.
