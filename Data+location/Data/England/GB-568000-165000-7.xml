		<content> The church is over 800 years old and  
 there have been 72 rectors! Mr.       
 Vousden is rector now. I liked the    
 stained glass windows, one is Norman. 
 There are six bells and Cuxton ringers
 meet every week to practise.  We rang 
 a real bell. There are 22 people in   
 the choir, about 100 attend on Sunday 
 mornings. Twenty four children go to  
 the Sunday School but there is another
 one at the village chapel. Six couples
 were married here in the last 4 weeks.
 Mr. Vousden holds 12 services a week. 
 At the end of the 800th anniversary   
 week on July 7th lots of people came  
 to the Sunday service. Our M.P. came  
 too. Some had to sit outside. Some    
 children from our school played       
 recorders and read poems. The Bishop  
 preached and we all had a picnic lunch
 on the grass outside.
