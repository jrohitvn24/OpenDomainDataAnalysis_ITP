		<content>       The  main  road, the  A390  goes
 though  the  centres of Gunnislake and
 St. Ann's   Chapel. This   main   road
 carries  traffic  from  Tavistock  and
 Callington  and at the weekend holiday
 makers travel  through  to the seaside
 resorts,  making  the  small  villages
 very  busy. The  stock which  comes to
 the shops is transported by lorries.  
       In  the  square  of   Gunnislake
 there  is a  bus stop for coaches from
 Fords Travel. Fords  Travel transports
 approximately  900  people  per  week,
 running  to  Tavistock  daily  and  to
 Callington weekly.  Approximately  360
 children are taken daily to Callington
 school.                               
       The railway  bridge  across  the
 A390 at Gunnislake Station is too low,
 so British  Rail  is  planning to move
 the station to the other  side  of the
 road and demolish the bridge.         </content>
