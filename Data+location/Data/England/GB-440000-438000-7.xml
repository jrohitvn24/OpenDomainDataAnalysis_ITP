		<content> This area is mainly a mixture of      
 farmland and woodland, with the A64   
 trunk road crossing the Northern      
 Section. The woodland is deciduous.   
 Most of the farmland consists of      
 fields containing pasture for sheep   
 and wheat. Woodlands Farm, in the     
 extreme North West of the section, is 
 380 years old and is rented from the  
 Bramham Park Estate. It is a mixed    
 farm, with the crops of wheat,        
 barley, oats and potatoes and the     
 livestock is 50 cattle, 1 bull and    
 200 sheep. Whitewells Farm is in the  
 extreme Northern Section and          
 concentrates in keeping geese. It has 
 two regular workers. In the extreme   
 North East of the section there are   
 some kennels which employ two people.
