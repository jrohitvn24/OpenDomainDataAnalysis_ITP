		<content> A TYPICAL DAIRY FARM IN THIS AREA     
 CONTAINS ABOUT 60 TO 70 COWS FOR      
 MILKING AND ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF  
 FOLLOWERS, THAT IS HEIFERS WHICH WILL 
 BE USED FOR MILKING  AFTER THEY HAVE  
 HAD THEIR FIRST CALF AT ABOUT TWO AND 
 A HALF YEARS OLD. THEY USUALLY PRODUCE
 MILK FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AND ARE    
 THEN SLAUGHTERED FOR PET FOOD.        
 GUERNSEY COWS ARE A FAVOURITE BREED AS
 THEY PRODUCE{GOLD TOP}MILK WHICH HAS  
 THE HIGHEST FAT(CREAM)CONTENT-4.9%. IT
 ALSO HAS A 3.6% PROTEIN CONTENT AND IS
 A VALUABLE SOURCE OF VITAMINS A AND D 
 AND ALSO CALCIUM AND CAROTENE. FARMERS
 COMPLAIN THAT THE SEVERITY OF THE     
 1984/1985 WINTER MEANT THAT THE COWS  
 HAD TO BE KEPT INDOORS FOR SEVEN      
 MONTHS INSTEAD OF THE USUAL SIX AND   
 THAT THIS INCREASED THE PROBLEMS OF   
 KEEPING THE ANIMALS CLEAN IN MUDDY    
 CONDITIONS.                           </content>
