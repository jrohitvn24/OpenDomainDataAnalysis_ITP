 I woke up at 7.05am today and I went  
 down to take the dogs for a walk.Later
 mum came down and I had breakfast and 
 a drink of chocolate.I got my lunch   
 ready, and brushed my teeth.At 8.30 my
 dad gave me a lift to school where I  
 put my bag away and went out to play. 
 After Assembly I wrote in my Week-end 
 Diary and we did two maths tests.Lunch
 was at 12.00 and we picniced outside. 
 At 1.15 we went back inside and       
 we had more lessons, until we left at 
 3.30 .                                
 After school I went with my           
 friend Jake to his Grandma's.         
 Afterwards, at home, for dinner I had 
 sausage and chips.                    
 I watched TV.until my friends came to 
 play football.                        
 At 9.00pm I put my bike away ,had a   
 bath and went to bed.                 </content>
