		<content>   The earliest settlers in this area  
 were the Belgae tribe from north west 
 France in approximately 80 BC via the 
 Thames estuary and the Lea.  The      
 Belgae established an important track 
 along the valley of the Ver.          
   The Roman invasion of Britain in    
 43 AD and subsequent development of an
 elaborate network has left its mark on
 the area.  The Romans developed the   
 Belgic track along the Ver valley as  
 Watling Street. On the highest piece  
 of ground between Watling Street and  
 the Harpenden Valley a Romano-British 
 temple or cemetery has been found.    
   The damp forests and heath of the   
 area were cleared over a long period. 
 As late as the Norman Conquest most of
 the woodland still had to be cleared. 
 The clearings made during the Middle  
 Ages survive today as Kinsbourne      
 Green, Wood End and Faulkener's End.  </content>
