		<title>13MODERN LIFE IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> Old cottages are 'in vogue' in today's
 society. Many people are moving into  
 properties in rural areas, restoring  
 or renovating old cottages to make    
 them into valuable 'desirable' homes, 
 rather than spoiling the character of 
 such places as Saddleworth with new   
 houses. They tend to commute daily to 
 Manchester, &amp; thus do not contribute  
 to everyday life in the area. Local   
 residents who were born &amp; bred in     
 Diggle regret this in general because 
 the village is being used simply as a 
 place to sleep. Even local trade      
 suffers as these commuters do not shop
 loacally, but tend to shop at their   
 place of work. The effect of this is  
 that local young people are tending to
 move away from the villages, mainly to
 get employment, as there is no hope of
 local work now mills are closed down, 
 &amp; little entertainment for them here. </content>
