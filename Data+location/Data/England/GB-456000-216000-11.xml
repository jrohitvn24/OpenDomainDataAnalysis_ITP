		<title>11ORCHID FIELDS</title>
		<content>Close to our village there are several 
hay meadows.These fields are relics of 
a bygone age,having by various means   
survived much as they were in the 19th 
Century.No artificial fertilizers or   
sprays have been used on them.The old  
ridge and furrows are still clearly    
visible.The furrows are often full of  
water late into the Spring.Grazed in   
the winter then left undisturbed       
until late in the summer for haymaking,
these meadows contain a rich variety of
plant life including green veined,     
common spotted,frog and marsh orchids. 
Cowslips,meadow-thistle,milkwort,salad 
burnett,dyers greenweed and field      
scabious all abound.Marbled white,     
meadow brown,gatekeeper and speckled   
wood butterflies all visit the flowers.
In early Spring the haunting cry of the
curlew can be heard and snipe may often
be flushed from the damp meadows.      </content>
