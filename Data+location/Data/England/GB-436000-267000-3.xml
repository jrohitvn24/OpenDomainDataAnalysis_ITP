		<content>     As I live in the  country me and  
{my sister Amy}have to play together.  
 When we want to play a game we usually
 need 3 or 4 to play so we have to     
 think of another game to play and that
 is usually boring.We have not any pets
 so we can't play with them.We used to 
 have{3 goldfish}but you couldn't play 
 with them.My{house}is just like an    
 ordinary house.The{kitchen}is fairly  
 big.The{lounge}is big.The{dining room 
 is smaller than the lounge.My{mum and 
{dad's room}is big and{my sister's}is  
 as big as the dining room.I think{my  
{room}is as big as my mum and dad's    
 room.The{bathroom}is not big and not  
 small.We have got a{playroom}and we   
 keep some of our toys in there in a   
 toycupboard.
