		<title>05St.Albans Stallholder's Day.</title>
		<content>  {6.ooam Wednesday,}I collect the {   
{goods }and drive the trailer to       
 St.Albans.Friends with fruit and veg. 
 stalls rose earlier to buy fresh      
 produce from a wholesaler.I {register 
{my stall by 8.30am}for if I am one    
 minute late I can't sell my wares that
 day and I might be banned altogether. 
   The blue &amp; yellow canopies are in   
 position as I {spread my wares on the 
{same spot}I've had for 40 years.The   
{sunny }weather attracts many {        
{customers,}some regular,some casual,  
 from {St.Albans &amp; district.           
   On wet days customers are few and   
 takings are low.I like the bustle,    
 meeting people and working in the     
 open. All day rubbish builds up and is
 collected regularly by the dust carts.
{By 4.30pm I pack up}because we can't  
 sell our wares after 5.00pm and       
 return home.                          </content>
