		<title>13GRAND WESTERN CANAL</title>
		<content>  The Grand Western Canal is a most    
 interesting "countryside Park"which   
 goes through the middle of our area.  
 It was originally designed as a short 
 cut to link the Bristol Channel to the
 English Channel in the late 18th      
 century,but the original plan had to  
 be abandoned and we are left with the 
 only branch that was ever completed.  
 It fell into disrepair and was only   
 rescued in the 1960's.The western     
 section nearer to Tiverton is used by 
 boats but our section of the canal is 
 kept as a nature reserve and boats are
 not allowed.The maintenance of the    
 canal is carried out by Devon County  
 Council and a team of men work full   
 time in order to preserve and maintain
 its structure and surroundings.
