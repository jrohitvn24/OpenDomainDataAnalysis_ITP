		<content> In the South lie the Gog Magog Hills, 
 a small but notable chalk outcrop,    
 rising to the dizzy height of 45      
 metres at Limepit Hill. The North     
 Eastern corner includes part of       
 Fulbourne Glen, now drained, and      
 providing rich agricultural land -    
 peas, beans, beet and wheat being the 
 main crops.                           
   The rest of the area is mainly flat 
 and well drained, suitable for farming
 or housing. Cherry Hinton and Fulbourn
 are the main settlements.             
   Cherry Hinton, lying nearer to      
 Cambridge, is mainly a dormitory      
 village, and is growing considerably  
 in size, with a huge new development  
 planned. Fulbourne is also largely a  
 dormitory and commuter settlement.    
   Both village contain a great mixture
 of housing, reflecting their historic 
 development.                          </content>
