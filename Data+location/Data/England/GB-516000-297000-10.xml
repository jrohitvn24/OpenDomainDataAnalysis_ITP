		<title>10Queensgate Shopping Centre</title>
		<content>{Queensgate}has been voted the best new
 covered shopping centre in Europe by  
 the International Council of Shopping 
 Centres. Situated in the heart of this
 ancient Cathedral city Queensgate     
 blends marble, mirror glass and       
 stainless steel on the inside with    
 stone, hand-made bricks and lead roofs
 on the outside. Great care has been   
 taken to integrate the new centre with
 the old buildings surrounding it and  
 many of these have been retained and  
 refurbished giving them a new lease of
 life. Queensgate has been called the  
 Jewel in the Crown of the new city and
 has made Peterborough the natural     
 centre for an area of more than       
 600,000 people in the East Midlands   
 and East Anglia. There are six major  
 stores and 80 shops and restaurants in
 a controlled climate together with    
 car parks for 2,000 cars.             </content>
