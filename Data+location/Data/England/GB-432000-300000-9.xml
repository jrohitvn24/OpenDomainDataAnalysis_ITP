 about 20miles from Birmingham

 Tamworth.The area has easy access by  
 road to the major towns of the        
 Midlands.The{M42}(at present under    
 construction) passes nearby and will  
 give better access to the main

 transport the residents of this area  
 are dependent upon the motor car.     </content>
