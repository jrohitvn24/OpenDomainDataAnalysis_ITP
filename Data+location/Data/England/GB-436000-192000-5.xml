		<title>05River Ock</title>
		<content>Fields bordering the River Ock were    
once marsh, and were subject to winter 
flooding, until the river level was    
lowered in 1979.  Unfortunately, from  
the farmer's point of view, lowering   
the level drained Bagmere Pond.  Where 
the River Ock passes through Charney   
Bassett, there has been much work done 
dredging and cleaning the river.  In   
1974 it was diverted in places.  There 
is a stone bridge over the river, and  
by the side there is an area of grass  
(with seats), which is much used by    
children for fishing and to paddle     
their feet in the water. Where the     
river flows through Lyford, it is about
10 feet wide, and flows strongly.      
Due to heavy pollution of the Thames   
salmon have not been here since the    
turn of the century. A valued delicacy-
the freshwater crayfish - is still     
obtainable in places.                  </content>
