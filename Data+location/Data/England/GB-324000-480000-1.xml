		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>    This area is on the fringe of the  
 Lake District National Park.It is part
 of the Furness Peninsula and ajoins   
 Morecambe Bay.The market town of      
 Ulverston is nearby and Croftlands    
 Estate, on the outskirts of the town, 
 comes within our area.The other major 
 area of population is Bardsea Village.
 Unemployment is not a major problem   
 many of the adult male and female     
 population are employed by either     
 Glaxochem or Vickers Shipbuilding and 
 both are firms which have not been hit
 by the recession, others are employed 
 on farms or in service industries     
 including tourism.The population is   
 not multi-racial and in many ways is  
 shielded from the general problems of 
 society in Britain in 1985.
