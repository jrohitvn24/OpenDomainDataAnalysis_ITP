		<title>13TEMPLE NORMANTONS NEW CHURCH</title>
		<content> The new church will be unique. In an  
 attempt to minimize the effects of    
 subsidence a concrete raft has been   
 built resting on the top of the ground
 To this will be bolted the structure  
 made of Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP)
 Made in Derby, GRP is light, strong,  
 durable, thermally efficient, easily  
 maintained and with an in-built stone 
 colour. The large panelled sections   
 are fitted together to create a barrel
 vaulted structure 8 metres wide and 16
 metres in length. Within the church   
 will be a worship area, vestry, cloak 
 rooms and a galley. The Altar, Font,  
 Lectern and other smaller items from  
 the old church will be incorporated in
 the new building. However, a flexible 
 interior is planned to allow for other
 community uses. Erected in the church 
 yard there will be a large fibre glass
 cross with metal railings at the base.</content>
