		<title>08MOUNTBATTEN WAY, CONGLETON</title>
		<content> One part of Congleton which has       
 changed in the past few years is      
 around Park Street. Much of this area 
 has been demolished and Mountbatten   
 Way has taken its place. Many houses  
 and shops have gone including a       
 barber's and a funeral director's     
 which is now in Bank Street. On Eaton 
 Bank there was a theatre called "The  
 Player's Hall". A new theatre called  
 Daneside Theatre was finished in 1984 
 next to the river Dane.{Mountbatten   
{Way was built to keep the heavy       
{traffic out of the town centre,some of
{which has now been pedestrianised.}The
 roundabouts at each end of Mountbatten
 Way are beautiful, the flowers and    
 cuttings are grown by Mr Sherratt and 
 his staff. He received the British    
 Empire Medal in the Queen's Birthday  
 Honours for his work.
