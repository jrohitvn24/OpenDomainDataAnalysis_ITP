		<title>06LOCAL HISTORY IN LEADENHAM</title>
		<content> Leadenham was formerly called Long    
 Leadenham or Long Leddesham.Leddesham 
 meaning "Village on the Ledge" and    
 Long coming from the development of   
 the village on the line of the ledge. 
 The word Long was eventually dropped  
 and the spelling altered to Leadenham.
 Gospel Lane has no connections with   
 the Church but used to be Goose Pool  
 Lane,the lane leading to the pool     
 where the village geese were kept.An  
 unusual road name is that of Lemon    
 Wong lane often called Limalong Lane  
 by local residents.The origin of the  
 name has been given in two ways,though
 they both tie in together.A wong was  
 the name for a piece of land and Leman
 or Lehman either a paramour or a pear 
 tree!As the pear tree was the old     
 symbol for infidelity - Lemon Wong    
 Lane was the boundary of the piece of 
 land given by a lord to his mistress. </content>
