		<content>  At school we play many games at      
 break- time.Here are some of them.    
           CHAIN CATCH.                
 Two people are hit.They hold hands and
 the others run off.After counting to  
 20 they chase the others.When one is  
 caught they join up but when another  
 is caught there are two pairs.        
             RUN ACROSS                
 In run across again 2 people are      
 hit.There is a line at the bottom of  
 the play ground and they stand        
 there.On either side of the play      
 ground there are boxes in  which the  
 others stand.The object of the game is
 to run across to each square.The      
 people who are hit try to hit you.The 
 last people to be hit are hit next    
 time that it is played.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
