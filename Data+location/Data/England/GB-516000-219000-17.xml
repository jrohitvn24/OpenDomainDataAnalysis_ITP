  On Sunday I get up at about 7.30.I   
 get dressed ready to go to church.At  
 about 9.30 Peter Saunders our choir   
 master picks me up with the rest of   
 the choir.We have a practice before   
 church starts.At 10 o'clock we get our
 robes on.We get into pairs and process
 round the church singing.Then at      
 11 o'clock I go home.At about 2       
 o'clock we have lunch.We usually have 
 chicken or lamb.After lunch at about  
 3.30 we go up to the tennis courts    
 because my Mum usually plays tennis   
 with Caroline Laws.At about 5 o'clock 
 we have cheese and biscuits for       
 tea.Then we watch television until we 
 go to bed.
