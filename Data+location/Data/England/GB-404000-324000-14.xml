		<content> There are less shops and more traffic 
 especially on Wednesdays when it is   
 market day in Uttoxeter. Lots of new  
 houses have been built. Some new      
 houses were built where the timber    
 yard was. Blithfield Reservior was    
 opened in 1953 and a new road to      
 Rugeley was made.There are fewer      
 public houses now. One chapel has     
 closed down. Old trades have died out 
 and many people work in Burton or     
 Stafford. There used to be two wheel  
 wrights shops in Bagots Street.
