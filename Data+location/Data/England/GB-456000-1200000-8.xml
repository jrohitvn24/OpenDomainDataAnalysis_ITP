 on the Westside of Uyeasound.It is    
 called Gardiesfauld.It is open from   
 April to November but the busiest     
 month is July and the quietest month  
 is April.                             
   A man and his wife who live across  
 the road,run the Youth Hostel.They    
 have run it since 1978 when they      
 bought it from the previous owner who 
 ran it from 1972.                     
   People come from all over the world 
 to stay,but most visitors are         
 students.30 people can stay at        
 once,some in single rooms,some in     
 larger rooms.There are bath and shower
 facilities as well as toilets and     
 facilities for cooking.In May 1985 it 
 cost Â£2 per night for adults and 80p  
 for children to stay.Meals are not    
 provided.
