		<title>13RELIGION, GRAINTHORPE</title>
		<content> Grainthorpe has a 14th Century Church 
 and a 19th Century Chapel;inside the  
 last decade two other chapels have    
 disappeared.Methodists are in the     
 majority and most of the children     
 attend the Chapel Sunday School,the   
 church not having had one for the last
 twenty years.                         
 Sunday School by a 7 year old girl.   
 On Sunday I went to Sunday School. We 
 sang "Kum ba yah",and "One more step  
 along the road I go",in the           
 chapel.Then we went into the Sunday   
 school room and we made a mosaic      
 cross. A mosaic is a pattern made of  
 stones.                               
 In the Chancel is a fragment of a     
 foliated brass cross.The centre of the
 head has a four leaved ornament       
 enclosing a cross.The base rests on a 
 rock in the sea in which swim 5       
 fishes. Date c 1384.                  </content>
