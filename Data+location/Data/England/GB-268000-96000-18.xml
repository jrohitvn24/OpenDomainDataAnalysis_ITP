		<title>18POWLESLAND FARM CONTINDUED</title>
		<content>   After we had looked at the calves   
 and seen the silos where the grain is 
 stored,Mr Powlesland told us how he   
 mixed 70% wheat,20% barley and 10%    
 protein and vitamins together to feed 
 the calves.He also showed us the mill 
 where they grind the grain to a fine  
 powder.                               
   Then Mr Powlesand took us to the old
 mill on Powlesland Farm. This was fun 
 because as far as we know it has      
 never been recorded or put on a map.  
 So we thought it would be a good idea 
 to record it for the first time in our
 1985 Domesday Project.                
   We discovered the place where the   
 water wheel used to be,we touched the 
 moss covered walls of the mill and we 
 followed the leat to the river and we 
 saw the flat land where the mill pond 
 used to be and we thought about what  
 it was like in the olden days.        </content>
