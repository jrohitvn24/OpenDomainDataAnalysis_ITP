		<content> Block contains four villages hidden in
 gently undulating country intersected 
 by small N/S tributaries of the Great 
 Ouse to the south which meanders in   
 the valley W to E. The area is        
 predominantly agricultural - one small
 dairy farm and five sizeable sheep    
 flocks, wheat, barley, oats, oilseed  
 rape and maize are grown on arable    
 land. Woodland, mainly amenity. Small 
 villages no longer provide labour for 
 farms and traditional village shops   
 almost extinct; cottages have been    
 gentrified by upwardly mobile and new 
 houses built as infilling. Stowe      
 School (3) is the site of the seat of 
 the Dukes of Buckingham - teaches 600+
 boys and a few girls. Large need for  
 labour. Magnificnet buildings and     
 amenity parkland with 'follys' and    
 classical temples. Soil types are     
 mixed due to glacial deposits - heavy </content>
