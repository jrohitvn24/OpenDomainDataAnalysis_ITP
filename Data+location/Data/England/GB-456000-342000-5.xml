		<title>05MULTI-FAITH RELIGION</title>
		<content> We a survey of the religion of 4      
 classes in our school and we found    
 that we had Christian,Moslem,Sikh,    
 Jew,Buddhist,Hinduand Quaker          
 children.Some had no particular       
 belief.About one third never went to  
 church,another third went sometimes   
 and the other third went to church or 
 temple regularly.Some of the children 
 go to the Sikh temple just up the     
 road.In out assemblies we sometimes   
 have people from the churches or      
 temples to talk to us.In school we    
 celebrate Eid and Diwali as well as   
 Christmas and Easter.We sing hymns    
 about peace and living together as    
 well as about God and Jesus.We have   
 stories from different                
 religions.Religion is every-body      
 worshipping in different ways.
