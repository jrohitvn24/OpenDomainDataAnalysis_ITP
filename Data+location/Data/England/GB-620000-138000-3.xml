		<title>03The Re-Opening of Aerodrome</title>
		<content> Shepway District Council is hoping to 
 re-open the World War 2 airfield at   
 Hawkinge. It will be used by light    
 aircraft.                             
   At a meeting in the village 76      
 people voted against the scheme.The   
 villagers fear possible noise,safety  
 and traffic problems. 60 letters of   
 protest have been received by the     
 council covering 23 grounds of        
 objection.A petition of opposition    
 containing 100 signatures has been    
 received.                             
   Many villagers support the proposed 
 scheme.A full meeting of Shepway      
 District Council will decide on the   
 scheme.                               
   A local comment:                    
 Local Councillor_Maybe it does mean   
 buisiness for the area but we should  
 not support it if it means disquiet   
 and discomfort for the locals.        </content>
