		<title>01The Hexton Area</title>
		<content> Our area lies on the County border    
 between the small towns of Hitchin in 
 Hertfordshire and Barton in           
 Bedfordshire which are linked by a    
 busy main road. Hexton village lies at
 the heart of the peace and tranquility
 of this rural area and the family who 
 own most of it and the surrounding    
 land, play a big part in the life of  
 the village. The chalky farm land is  
 used mainly for forestry and the      
 raising of cearal crops. The land is  
 hilly which makes hard work for the   
 farmers.Lots of people visit the area 
 to walk the many footpaths and climb  
 the hills, enjoying the beautiful     
 countryside. The area is carefully    
 looked after to preserve the          
 attractive buildings. Nature reserves 
 have been established to encourage    
 wild animals and rare flowers to      
 flourish.                             </content>
