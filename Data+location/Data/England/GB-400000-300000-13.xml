		<title>13FISH,WATERFOWL AND FOXES</title>
		<content> On the edge of the area is a pool     
 known as "The Swag". It is on an open 
 space with a large area of water.     
 There are many birds here including   
 coot, moorhen, tufted duck, mallard   
 and a family of mute swans. "The Swag"
 is connected to Stubbers Green via a  
 tunnel under the Aldridge Road. A     
 large area of reeds here provides     
 cover and shelter for the birds as    
 well as a supply of food. A lot of    
 people fish here and tench, roach,    
 pike, chub, perch, bream and gudgeon  
 are present.                          
 In Greenfields Road there is a horses 
 field with a pond where herons fish.In
 our area there a lot of foxes. Two    
 chickens have recently been eaten by  
 them. Some people have seen foxes     
 looking into the bins, but nobody has 
 seen them attack any chickens.
