		<title>13CUSTOMS_ THE COURT LEET</title>
		<content>  Northleach is the only town in       
 England to have a Court Leet. It was  
 the only system of government in the  
 Middle Ages. Today, it meets every    
 Autumn. The people elected at the     
 Court are a high bailiff who is like a
 mayor, two constables who were        
 originally police officers, a         
 tythingman who used to check the      
 produce sold at the market and a      
 hayward who collected all the cows    
 from the town and took them to the    
 Downs. Now the young people carry on  
 the tradition by tin_banging when the 
 high bailiff is elected. The election 
 takes place in the Wheatsheaf Hotel   
 and in the evening there is a big     
 dinner in the Cotswold Hall for the   
 men.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
