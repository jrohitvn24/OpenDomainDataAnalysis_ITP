		<content>    For many years{Newbridge High      
{School}was looked on as a landmark by 
 many people.                          
   It was built in 1909 and was first  
 called King Edward V11 grammar school.
   In March 1984 the school was badly  
 damaged in an arson attack. The front 
 of the main building was distroyed,   
 the balcony went up in flames and the 
 roof caved in. Much of the equipment  
 and pictures were destroyed and the   
 whole structure weakened.             
   As a result of the fire, part of the
 playing field has been turned into a  
 site for mobile classrooms. Teachers  
 and volunteers helped to clear the    
 debris, seeing what could be saved.   
   The builders have just started to   
 rebuild the end gables of the         
 building.
