		<content> At the Church when there is a wedding 
 taking place, children from around the
 village come to sing in the choir.The 
 children outside bring bits of string 
 and tie the gates up. At the end of   
 the wedding the choir get fifty pence 
 each.Then the Bride and Groom come out
 to have their photographs taken.      
                                       
 When the Bride and Groom go down the  
 path they find that the gates have    
 been tied up by the children. The Best
 Man comes and he throws some coins    
 out as a ransom.                      
                                       
 While the Bride and Groom are having  
 their photographs taken, it gives the 
 children in the choir a chance to get 
 to where all the other children are   
 and to pick up the pennies. While this
 is happening the Bride and Groom get  
 out.                                  </content>
