		<title>08BASIN HOWE FARM, BROMPTON</title>
		<content> Where I live is a very intersting     
 place because just over a field there 
 are some{war dikes}which me and my    
 brother sometimes go metal detecting  
 and find old shells.The dikes are just
 like camels' humps. The land around   
 our farm is good for growing crops    
 on.Our field is good for growing grass
 because it has {goats}in it.The grass 
 when we first came here was about     
 a foot high then the goats moved in   
 and in a few weeks it was about 4     
 inchs high.We have a field which we   
 sometimes grow {grass}for {hay }and   
 once we grew carrots and              
 sugarbeet.There is one patch in this  
 field that we grow {comfry}and we made
 some{comfry ointment} with the comfry 
 and elder leaves.We have a{howe}&lt;an   
 ancient burial mound>, and our own {  
{ram}for pumping up our water from     
 Troutsdale.                           </content>
