		<content> The Quarry Hills Home used to be the  
{                                      
{workhouse}in Victorian times. A new   
 building is at present under          
 construction.                         
 In Thornborough Gardens there is a    
 block of {sheltered accommodation}    
 where people who are not able to do   
 everything for themselves are housed. 
 A warden is in residence. Each of the 
 21 flats is self-contained and there  
 is a communal lounge where residents  
 can meet together to chat.Two of the  
 residents of these flats are over 90  
 years old.                            
 As will be seen there is ample        
 provision made for the elderly people 
 of the area to be housed.
