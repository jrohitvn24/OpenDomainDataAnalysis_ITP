		<title>14SEASHORE AT THE WITTERINGS</title>
		<content> The higher part of the beach at East  
 Wittering is covered with shingle up  
 to the low sea wall.It is divided into
 segments by groynes,which act as a sea
 defence,breaking up the force of the  
 incoming waves.As the tide recedes a  
 flat sandy beach is revealed.Looking  
 out to sea you can see The Nab Tower, 
 an old Martello Tower,and the Northern
 shore of the Isle of Wight.           
 People walk along the foreshore       
 throughout the year,but during the    
 Summer months visitors throng to the  
 Witterings and Bracklesham beaches.   
 Attractions include safe swimming,    
 sand,sailing,surfing and wind surfing.
 The local coastguard are constantly   
 alert during this time and often have 
 to contact the rescue services when   
 sailors or wind surfers run into      
 difficulty.The beaches are also       
 scanned by air/sea resuce services.   </content>
