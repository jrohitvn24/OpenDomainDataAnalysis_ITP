		<title>18HAMSEY GREEN SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content>{ Hamsey Green - a local shopping      
{                 centre.}             
    One of the largest shopping parades
 is Hamsey Green which consists of     
 about twenty-five shops, including a  
 branch of Interflora.                 
    The most popular shops used were   
 the post office, the Co-op, Woolworths
 and the bakery. Most people visited   
 only if they ran out of anything. Some
 people travelled up to 5 KM to reach  
 Hamsey Green. Most people walk there. 
 No-one in our survey used the 403 bus.
    Customers who go to Browns the     
 Bakers in Hamsey Green live in a local
 area of about 3 KM. The shop is quite 
 small and could get quite crowded on a
 Saturday.                             
    Overall, the Hamsey Green shops are
 well situated, although there is room 
 for improvement, like more specialist 
 shops and a better bus service.       </content>
