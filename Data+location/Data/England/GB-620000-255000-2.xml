  As is the case with many of our      
villages,Otley is first mentioned      
by name in the Domesday Book(1086).    
The name is thought to mean            
Â£the clearing or meadow of Ota',who    
would have been an early Anglo-Saxon   
settler.He was by no means the first   
person to settle here,however.Romano-  
British pottery found near the church  
indicates much earlier habitation,and  
there are almost certainly other       
similar or,perhaps,even older sites yet
to be discovered.The Romans drove a    
road through what is now the southern  
end of the village,and archaeological  
evidence suggests that there were      
several Roman settlements in the area, 
although none has yet been found in    
Otley itself.
