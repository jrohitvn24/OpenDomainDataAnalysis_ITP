		<title>01BOUGHTON'S LOCATION</title>
		<content>   In our block there are only small   
 villages.We have six different ones   
 they are,Goodnestone,Fostall,Hernhill,
 part of Dargate,part of Dunkirk and   
 finally most of Boughton-under-Blean. 
   All the villages that have been     
 mentioned are mainly farming villages 
 except Boughton which is a mixture of 
 farming and ribbon development.       
   Boughton is on the busy A2 route    
 between London,Canterbury and Dover,  
 but since 1976 the Bypass has         
 re-routed the heavy traffic around the
 village.(Please see traffic survey    
 page 8).From Boughton, London is 52   
 miles away,Dover 23 miles, Canterbury 
 is 5 miles and Faversham 3 miles west.
   Although Boughton is a farming      
 village,most people work out side of  
 Boughton and live in the village.Farm 
 workers have had their jobs replaced  
 by machinery,except for some pickers. </content>
