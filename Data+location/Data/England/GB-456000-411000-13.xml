		<title>13  THE COMMUNITY POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> Our community Policeman is called Glyn
 Burndred. We asked him about his      
 job. He said, "A community constable  
 is a constable with a special         
 responsibility towards the people in  
 his area, to help any person who has a
 need of any description. He provides a
 bridge between the man in the street  
 and the police and is readily         
 available because he travels on foot  
 or bicycle."                          
          He has been a community      
 policeman for 4 years. He said he     
 likes being a community policeman     
 because he likes meeting peaple and   
 solving problems. A community         
 policeman only carries a radio - no   
 truncheon or weapons. A community     
 policemen never goes in a car. He     
 walks or goes on a bicycle.
