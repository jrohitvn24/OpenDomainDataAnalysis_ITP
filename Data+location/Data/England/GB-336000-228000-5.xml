		<title>05 LONG TIME VILLAGERS</title>
		<content> We went to see Mrs Reece and Mr       
 Michael who have lived in Ewyas Harold
{village all their life}and have seen a
 lot of changes in that time. After the
 war evacuated children came back to   
 their home, more babies were born and 
 more families from outside came here  
 to live.Mains water, electricity and  
 drains were provided and many more    
 houses were built. In the fifties     
{bungalows}were very popular and the   
 number of{council}owned{houses        
 increased from{4 to 74.}The main      
 difference to the school of today is  
 that most children remained at the old
{school}till the age of{14.}There      
 hasn't been much change in the{shops  
 but there are{fewer}now than in the   
 war because most households have a{car
 and can{shop}in{Hereford}or           
{Abergavenny.
