		<content>  My name is Ziek Hardwick, I am 12    
 years old. I have two brothers,       
 Joel aged seven and Luke aged three.  
  My mum is a barmaid at Batley Sports 
 Centre. My dad is a postman. He gets  
 up at 3.30 a.m. every morning except  
  Sundays. He finishes work at about 12
 noon.                                 
  On Monday morning when I get up I put
 on my school uniform, I go downstairs 
 light the fire and have my breakfast. 
 Then Luke and Joel get up, we have an 
 argument, Joel starts crying and tells
 mum, and we all have a mass argument. 
 This stops at 8.20 a.m. when I go out.
  School finishes at 3.35 p.m. After an
  action packed day I get home and     
 we're all friends again. Then I do my 
 homework and have my tea. After that  
 I go out for a game of football or    
 American football. I take my brothers 
 to bed and then watch T.V.            </content>
