		<title>04Family Life in Haslington.</title>
		<content> Much of the family life is centred in 
 and around the village.Many couples   
 have young families and this          
 influences greatly the activities of  
 the family.                           
 The majority of fathers are the main  
 earner of the family although this is 
 now becoming less of the norm         
 Many families have moved into the area
 because of its attractiveness and     
 commute to larger places of work.     
 Family holidays are dictated by the   
 parents' work, the main holiday period
 being in July to coincide with those  
 of Rolls Royce works.
