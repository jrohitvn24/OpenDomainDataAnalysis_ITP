		<content> The annual  Dursley Carnival          
 procession assembles in the car park  
 of Mawdsleys electrical engineering   
 firm before making its way through the
 town centre to the recreation field.  
   In 1985 the Carnival procession took
 place on the 15th June. The theme for 
 this year was 'Fantasia' and the six  
 decorated floats and about sixty      
 walking entries depicted this theme by
 portraying 101 Dalmatians, Snow White,
 Ghostbusters and similar stories.     
   As the procession wound its way     
 along the crowd-lined roads in the    
 bright sunshine spectators were able  
 to see the result of the judging which
 had taken place at the assembly       
 point.Winners in the various classes  
 displayed appropriate cards.          
   The procession included a steel band
 and a company of Majorettes.
