		<content>  We live in{East Anglia.}We are about 
 two and a half hours away from{London,
 the capital city.We are half an hour  
 away from the East Coast.The soil is  
 very dark in colour and very rich and 
 crops grow well in it.                
       The land is very flat.There is  
 not a lot of woodland and most of the 
 land is used as farmland.There are    
 very few cattle or sheep.This area is 
 famous for its vegetable and fruit    
 growing.Produce from this area is     
 taken all over the country to be      
 sold.One of the fruits grown is the   
 strawberry and one of the most common 
 vegetables grown is the lettuce.      
       Although there are many modern  
 machines to help the farmer,many jobs 
 are still done by hand and you can    
 often see men and women hoeing or     
 weeding in the fields.
