		<content> Wymondham College is unusual, being a 
 large boarding school run by a Local  
 Education Authority. For many years it
 was a grammar school, taking pupils   
 from regions of Norfolk which were not
 close to other grammar schools.  At   
 one point it had large numbers of day 
 pupils and reached nearly 1900.       
 Following reorganisation in the       
 County, the College became            
 comprehensive in its intake, catering 
 largely for pupils with boarding need.
 There are now (1985) no day pupils in 
 the 1st to 5th years, but a very large
 number of day pupils in the 6th form. 
 Total numbers are now about 900,      
 nearly half in the sixth form. The    
 College has a reputation for good     
 results and has been involved in many 
 innovative programs.
