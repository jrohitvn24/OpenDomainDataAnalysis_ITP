 slide. There is a football pitch plus 
 a BMX course. There is also a shop    
 selling sweets and lollipops.         
  Jock's Lane is a good park. There are
 swings to play on and there's a slide.
 They even have a pulley. Near the shop
 there is a paddling pool. Right at the
 end of the park is a miniature steam  
 train that you can have a ride on.    
 There are tennis courts and crazy     
 golf. Last of all, there is a stream  
 called{The Cut}with a little bridge   
 that goes across it. They are both    
 very popular.
