		<title>03Ivy Farm, Horningtoft</title>
		<content>  This farm is an arable and livestock 
 farm, the arable side is barley and   
 wheat and sometimes fields are let    
 off to other farmers.The farmer owns  
 26 acres and this year it is 22 acres 
 barley and 4 acres wheat and the      
 actual farm buildings are 2 acres so  
 it is quite big in all.               
  The livestock side is pigs, the pigs 
 are large whites bred on the farm and 
 sold to various farmers who fatten    
 them up for pork,but the farmer is    
 thinking of fattening them up him-    
 self.                                 
  The farmer employs one helper to help
 him through the day because it is     
 quite a busy job.                     
  There is not much machinery, only a  
 plough and slurry tanker also two     
 tractors and one trailer. Most other  
 work is done by the neighbouring      
 farmer on contract.                   </content>
