		<title>01THE MORETON &amp; LEASOWE AREA</title>
		<content> This block is made up of the area     
 around {Moreton}and{Leasowe.}Moreton  
 is slightly west and more inland than 
 Leasowe, which is on the north coast  
 of the {Wirral Peninsula}.            
                                       
 Moreton has quite a large shopping    
 area, centred on {Moreton Cross},which
 forms a junction of two main roads.   
 The Moreton area is made up of private
 and council housing estates.          
                                       
 Leasowe has a large leisure centre and
 is noted for{Leasowe Castle}and {     
{Leasowe Lighthouse}, both of which    
 are of local historic interest.       
                                       
{Cadbury Typhoo}and{Squibb's}both have 
 factories in the Moreton/Leasowe area.
                                       
 The area is very low lying and a  sea 
 wall protects it from flooding.       </content>
