		<content> The area offers several crafts-people 
 and artists. Retired people do        
 knitting, crochet, macrame work and   
 various artistic hobbies. Working     
 people find time to enjoy spinning,   
 weaving, crocheting, lacemaking and   
 art. Local craft classes are held in  
 the winter months for lampshade making
 and needlework. There are dairy       
 related crafts for example butter     
 making, cheese and yoghurt. Many      
 people do home needlework including   
 embroidery. There is also a lithograph
 printer in the area as well as a      
 porcelain potter who does retail work.
 Flower arranging is another popular   
 hobby in the village.
