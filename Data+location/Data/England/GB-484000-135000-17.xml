		<title>17Walking the dog.</title>
		<content>      Most{Saturday mornings}I walk the
 dog with my friends and their dogs.   
      We leave the road where we live  
 at about half-past eight and walk down
 the busy Headley Road.                
      We walk through the village      
 square with the dogs on a lead and    
 then into the{cool quiet woods. }We   
 walk down the hill where we let the   
 dogs off their leads.  We walk up     
 hills and down hills, along rough flat
 ground.                               
      After about thirty minutes we    
 come to a{big open space}covered with 
 bracken and a path going through the  
 middle. We call that The Plain.       
      After a while we start to walk   
 back to the busy road and the village 
 of{Grayshott.                         
      When we're back home the dogs are
 glad of a{drink}and a{rest.
