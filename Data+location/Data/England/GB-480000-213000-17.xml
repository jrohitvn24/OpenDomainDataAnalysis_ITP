		<content>  {Housewives} do their own {housework}
daily and it takes them 2-3 hours. They
don't mind it but enjoy it. Most       
families have 3 daily meals. Popular   
{meals} include: for breakfast- toast  
and cereal; for Sunday dinner- roast.  
Most women don't like buying           
convenience foods and they enjoy       
making cakes. Few people grow their    
own food. Instead, they shop in        
superstores weekly. Many women cook    
foreign foods and families rarely eat  
out or go out together. Instead, the   
children go to clubs. Many families    
have picnics, but classical            
{entertainment} is still popular. Most 
families watch television and read.    
Many people have videos but few hire   
films. Housewives listen to the radio  
and get newspapers daily. Most         
families take a yearly holiday for 1-4 
weeks. Most families have pets.        </content>
