		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY SCRAPTOFT</title>
		<content> Scraptoft village has a Scandinavian  
 name,but it is not known if there was 
 an Anglian settlement there before    
 'Scrapi'arrived at the time of the    
 Danish invasions.                     
 The village is mentioned in the       
 Domesday Book,a copy of which is to be
 found in All Saints Church.At this    
 time the manor belonged to the newly  
 founded priory at Coventry.           
 Nowadays Scraptoft is much less       
 spoiled than most of the peripheral   
 villages.The church is typical of East
 Leicestershire,i.e.ironstone fabric   
 with limestone dressings and built    
 round about 1300.The church has some  
 monuments to the Wigleys who lived at 
 the adjacent hall which is now part of
 the Polytechnic.Stained glass windows 
 commemorate the Corah family and      
 depict St.Margaret.This is used as a  
 trade mark on clothes made by the firm</content>
