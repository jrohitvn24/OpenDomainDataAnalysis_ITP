		<title>14HARVEL WOMEN'S INSTITUTE</title>
		<content> Harvel Women's Institute was founded  
 in l952 and now has a membership of 35
 ladies who come from the surrounding  
 area.   It is one of l2 Institutes in 
 the Thameside District of the Kent -  
 West Kent Federation of Women's       
 Institutes.  Members meet monthly in  
 the Village Hall for either a         
 practical demonstration or an         
 illustrated talk by outside speakers  
 on a chosen subject, planned by the   
 Committee a year in advance.  Classes 
 are arranged for art and craft on a   
 regular basis.  We also take part in  
 fund-raising for charities and the    
 Village Hall with jumble sales, sales 
 of craftwork and a stall at the annual
 Village Fete.  Members play in darts, 
 scrabble and bridge tournaments and   
 provide entertainment for our own and 
 other WI's in the district.
