 Road,Faversham,Kent. I live with my

      On Monday,22nd. of July 1985 our 
 class went to the Maison Dieu we saw a
 skeleton and big a big pot that had   
 been put together. There were lots of 
 fossils,pottery,jewelry and many other
 interesting objects. Mr.Santer,the    
 curator told us about the local       
 history of the area. He said that the 
 Maison Dieu used to be a resting place
 and hospital for pilgrims travelling  
 to Canterbury Cathedral with a special
 room for the Kings.
