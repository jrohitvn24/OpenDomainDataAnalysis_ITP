		<content> A local character has recently died.  
 His obituary in a local newspaper     
 described him as farmer, litigant,    
 historian, book collector, scourge of 
 freemasonry, politicians, peers,      
 leftists, rightists and policeman and 
 as seeing evil and conspiracy         
 everywhere.                           
 His main achievements were his        
 exposure of the incompetence of       
 Borough Council officials who allowed 
 priceless library books to be stolen  
 or sold when they were clearing out   
 the old Bedford library and the       
 dispute with the County Council over  
 land at Village Farm where he lived.  
 He appeared in person at the High     
 Court and won the case.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
