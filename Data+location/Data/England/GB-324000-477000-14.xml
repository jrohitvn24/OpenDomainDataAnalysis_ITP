		<content>           Ellabarrow: In Pennington,by
 a stream,in a field there is a mound  
 called Ellabarrow.Its shape is like an
 upturned boat with a point at each    
 end.It is about 60 metres long,10     
 metres wide and 6 metres high.Legend  
 says that a Saxon chieftan;Aela,is    
 buried in it under his boat.It is said
 to be over 1000 years old.Pennington  
 Castle; If you visited this you       
 wouldn't think it was a castle because
 it has no stone walls.It is just a    
 mound of earth built around two sides 
 of a piece of earth shaped like a     
 headland.We think it may have been    
 built thousands of years ago by Bronze
 Age people.It is surrounded by steep  
 edges and a stream runs down one      
 side.At one time there may have been a
 wooden fence round the top and you can
 still see the remains of a ditch on   
 two sides.                            </content>
