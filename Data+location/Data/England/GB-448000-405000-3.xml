 and potatoes.Hill Farm hires potato   
 pickers.In Spring cereal factories go 
 to the{farms}in the area to buy the   
{crops}from last years{harvest}.Each   
 farm has about five  farmworkers .Soft
 fruit is grown at Marr for people to  
 pick.Every so often one of the farmers
 hires a biplane or helicopter to spray
 the{crops}.This is done to kill       
 insects or blight.Also at{harvest},   
 lorries are hired to take the grain to
 the silos. After the corn has been cut
 the straw is bailed by a firm or it is
