		<content>On Thursday it was Halloween.David     
Bridle came to my house and we went out
Trick or Treating.This means that we   
ask people if they want a trick played 
on them or are they going to give us a 
small present.We went with some of our 
friends and we dressed up as ghosts.We 
started out at 5.30p.m. and we went    
straight down the road.We got a lolly  
from one house and a toffee from       
another house.Then we started to run   
round the village because some people  
attacked David and I with flour bombs  
and water bombs.They had some porridge 
oats,Fairy Liquid and eggs.We ran from 
house to house and we got lots of money
and we got a few sweets.We saw lots of 
other people Trick or Treating.We gave 
the money we collected to help buy food
for the people in Ethiopia.
