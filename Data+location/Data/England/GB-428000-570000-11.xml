		<title>11 LAND RECLAMATION-BACKWORTH.</title>
		<content> The closure of the Eccles Colliery    
left a large area of derelict land     
around Backworth.This land is being    
reclaimed. Some of this land has been  
used to build housing in the Church    
Road area.                             
Part of the old pit buildings has been 
developed into small factory units.The 
units are privately rented.One of the  
units is being used for trailer        
building.Other units are involved with 
house extensions and a variety of metal
working.                               
The development of this land will      
continue with the building of more     
private housing and more factory       
facilities.
