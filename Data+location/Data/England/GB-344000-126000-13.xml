		<title>13Furniture restorer (2)</title>
		<content> When making new furniture wood from   
 the timber merchant is not used.      
 Instead,they cannibalise old,disused  
 pieces of furniture(tables,sideboards,
 wardrobes and cupboards )because the  
 wood from these is well seasoned.They 
 obtain most of this from auctions but 
 also from people who ask them to clear
 unwanted furniture from their homes.  
 Mr Perrin  uses machinary to cut the  
 wood to size and to plane but the rest
 of the work is done with hand tools.  
 Scotch glue made from animal          
 bones,is used in preference to        
 synthetic glues.The polisher          
 uses'button' polish(made from beetles)
 shellac,garnet polish and 'Briwax" for
 pine.The business advertises in a     
 local free advertiser booklet,but     
 their customers are drawn from the    
 whole of the West Country.
