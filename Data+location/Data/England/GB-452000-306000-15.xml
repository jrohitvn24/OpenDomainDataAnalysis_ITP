		<title>15BROWNIES IN GROBY</title>
		<content> My name is Penelope Isaac. On Fridays 
 I go to{Brownies.}It is good at       
 Brownies. We play a game called{Sticky
{Witch.}There are two people 'on' and  
 the rest of the Brownies are at the   
 side of the room. Then the Brownies at
 the side try to run across the        
 hall. If they get tagged they go to   
 the side and that makes more people   
 'on'.                                 
                                       
 There's another game called{Hedgehog.}
 One person has a whistle and another  
 a cloth. We all go skipping round the 
 hall until the whistle is blown. Then 
 we all go down and roll into a ball.  
 The person with the cloth walks round 
 and puts it onto one of us and says   
 "ready". The person in the cloth      
 mustn't move. We have to guess who it 
 is and the person who gets it right is
 'on' next time.                       </content>
