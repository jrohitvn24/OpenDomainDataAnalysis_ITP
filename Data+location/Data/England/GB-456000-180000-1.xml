      The survey area lies on the      
 eastern edge of the{Berkshire Downs}  
 which are arable uplands. Along the   
 summit runs the ancient{Ridgeway,}used
 as a main trading route during the    
 Bronze Age.                           
                                       
                                       
      Woodlands are found on the higher
 ground due to the presence of a thin  
 layer of clay-with-flints which holds 
 water.                                
                                       
                                       
  The{River Thames,}flowing            
 north-south at this point has cut     
 through this line of chalk hills at   
 the famous{Goring Gap,}where the twin 
 villages of{Goring and Streatley}lie  
 on each river bank. Further east the  
 hills continue as the{Chilterns.}     </content>
