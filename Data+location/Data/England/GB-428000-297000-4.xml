		<content>Although Atherstone had social and     
economic difficulties the traditional  
grain market flourished and helped     
to supplement their agricultural       
payment by trading.New trades were thus
introduced that had hardly any link to 
existing ones that were land biased.A  
thriving wool and cloth trade was being
provided by at least two weavers using 
wool,flax and hemp.It was during the   
latter years of the 17C that there     
emerged two felt makers -Thomas Wilday 
and Joseph Hatton who brought about the
basis for the 19C hat trade which has  
made Atherstone famous.As the quantity 
and type of trader increased,so was    
there a need for more comfortable      
conditions.The old tenements were      
improved by masons,bricklayers etc that
were employed by the now prosperous    
traders.The annual fair lost its       
importance and became an entertainment.</content>
