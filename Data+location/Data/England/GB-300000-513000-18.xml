		<title>18A 6TH FORM FOR CLEATOR MOOR</title>
		<content> The County Council Education Committee
 had given permission for a sixth form 
 to be set up at Ehenside Comprehensive
 School in Cleator Moor but there was  
 outrage when Sir Keith Joseph, the    
 Secretary of State for Education      
 refused to allow it, saying that it   
 wasn't viable.                        
                                       
 If children wish to take 'A' levels   
 they have to transfer to Whitehaven   
 School. They then have to get used to 
 a new school and new teachers as well 
 as study for the exams. If their      
 parents transfer them earlier than at 
 16, Ehenside is left with an          
 unbalanced range of ability and cannot
 be a true comprehensive. It would have
 given the school a tremendous boost to
 start their own sixth form courses.   
                                       
 It is planned to appeal.              </content>
