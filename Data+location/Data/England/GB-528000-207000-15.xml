		<title>15The use of Bayford Station</title>
		<content>  {One person}is employed at Bayford   
 Station; he works a split shift, 4    
 hours in the morning and 4 hours in   
 the evening to cover the rush hours.  
 Repair work on the line is done on    
 Sundays so as to cause minimal        
 inconvenience, as not many people use 
 the railway on Sundays.               
   Bayford Station is not used a great 
 deal; during the rush hours about{100 
{commuters}use the station, and about  
 30 during non-peak hours. In the car  
 park at Bayford and on the road       
 outside about 40 cars are parked      
 daily.                                
   A{bus service}No. 308 from Hertford 
 runs by the station but only on{2 days
{of the week.                          
   Train passes and tickets are used in
 about the same amount, showing there  
 are a lot of regular train users at   
 Bayford Station.                      </content>
