		<content>Next I go to the village shop to buy   
some groceries which I forgot to buy   
in the supermarket in Northampton.At   
l pm I have lunch,a cheese roll,apple  
and cup of coffee,relaxing for l/2 hour
reading the newspaper before changing  
into my tracksuit for an afternoon jog.
4 miles in 4O minutes.Just time for a  
shower before collecting the boys from 
school.Whilst the boys watch television
I prepare an evening meal of casseroled
beef,onions,carrots,tomatoes and       
potatoes.Philip does homework before   
dinner as he has a cub scout meeting in
Long Buckby afterwards.At 6 pm. my     
husband returns and we have dinner in  
the kitchen.Whilst I wash the dishes   
Philip is taken to cubs by car.I bath  
Paul and put him to bed at 8pm.I fetch 
Philip from cubs and then relax        
watching television and reading before 
going to bed at llpm.Just another day! </content>
