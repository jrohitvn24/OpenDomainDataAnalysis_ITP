		<title>12ELLISTONE FARM - STAINLAND</title>
		<content> Ellistone Farm is in the middle of {  
{Stainland}village. We visited this    
 farm because it is typical of farms in
 our area. It is owned by Crowther's.  
      Ellistone Farm was built in 1606 
 and is a cattle farm. The cattle are  
 bred for beef and dairy products.     
      The dairy cows are called        
 Friesans. The cows have to be milked  
 twice a day. At this farm the milking 
 takes a long time because the milking 
 parlour has only room for four cows at
 a time, and there are 60 cows to milk 
 in summer and 110 cows in winter. To  
 milk the cows the farmer puts glass   
 pipes on to the cows' udders, the milk
 flows through the pipes into two big  
 tanks. Here the milk is stored until  
 the milk tanker collects it and takes 
 it to{Longley Farm}near Holmfirth     
 where it is made into cottage cheese  
 and yoghurt.                          </content>
