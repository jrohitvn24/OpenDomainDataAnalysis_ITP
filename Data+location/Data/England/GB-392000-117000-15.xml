		<content>   There are also many badgers and     
 there is a badger sett in the downs,  
 and another to the east of the school.
 They will go 6 miles in search of     
 food. The area is a good habitat for  
 badgers. Keepers shoot and gas        
 foxes but they often escape wounded.  
 Mrs Reynolds found a dead fox with    
 fifteen shots in it.                  
   The vole population goes up and     
 down but is up now. Voles earth up    
 plants but they can be poked out of   
 their holes and shot. There are some  
 dormice but they are fast dying out.  
 Warfarin is laid down for rats as it  
 solidifies the blood.                 
   This area is a wildlife paradise    
 except for the fact that there are no 
 lakes, ponds or streams. So water     
 creatures are rare particularly as the
 artificial ponds have disappeared.
