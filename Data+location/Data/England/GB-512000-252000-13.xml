		<title>13The Great Barford Milkman.</title>
		<content> My dad is the Great Barford milkman.  
 He gets up at 5.00am and drives to the
 depot in Bedford in his car.He        
 collects his milk float and drives    
 back to Barford.He starts his round at
 about 6.00am.He delivers to 400       
 houses,leaving fruit juice,fizzy      
 drinks,bread,eggs,potatoes and five   
 different kinds of milk.              
 He finishes his round at 11.oo and    
 goes back to Bedford. On the way back 
 he writes out the goods he will need  
 for next day into a note book. When he
 gets back he unloads all the empty    
 bottles. Then he goes into the        
 ordering room and orders what is      
 required for the following day. He    
 fixes the recharger in to the battery 
 on the milk float. He goes back in the
 car and finishes at about 12.00.
