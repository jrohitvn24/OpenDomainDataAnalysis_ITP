		<title>10Felixstowe Pier</title>
		<content>    At the beginning of the Pier there 
 is an{amusement arcade,}with fruit    
 machines,Penny Falls and snooker      
 tables.The Pier itself is mainly used 
 for fishing,but there is a slide on it
 and a mini car track.Before the war,  
 the{Pier}used to be three times as    
 long as it is now,but it was hit by a 
 bomb and the main bit was demolished  
 because it was a target for the       
 Germans to land.                      
    There used to be another pier as   
 well,down by the{Fludyer Arms Inn,}but
 it is now no longer there.At low tides
 you can just see the stumps of it.    
    Just before the start of the Pier, 
 there used to be the{Pier Pavilion,   
 where people went to see shows and    
 concerts.In 1983 it was knocked down  
 and a new swimming complex has been   
 built instead.
