		<title>11 My house by  Paul Sparkes</title>

    Our house is 300 years old and it  
had lots of farm barns. We have 2 acres
of land and the field next to us is 50 
acres. We have an old water pump near  
our sand pit. Our house has some very  
old beams. I have got 50 chickens which
I have to feed every day. We took down 
an old cattle shed and in its place    
there is a car park.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
