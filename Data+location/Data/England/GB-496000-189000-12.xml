Our local Baptist Church is quite      
popular on Sundays. In the morning     
service about 700 people attend. During
the week other groups, including youth 
club, meet for social activities and   
during the summer holidays camps are   
held for various age groups.On Sunday  
afternoons the church orchestra and    
choir meet for practice and tea.The    
church has also purchased several      
houses which it runs as old folks      
homes. THE PARISH CHURCH is the oldest 
building in the village and has been   
rebuilt several times. The choir and   
bellringers meet regularly and many    
other groups are closely attached to   
the church, including youth clubs,young
wives and Sunday School.
