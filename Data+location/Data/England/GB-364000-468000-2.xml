		<content> Every Wednesday I waken up at 7.30 I  
 then stop in bed for a bit. When it's 
 8.00 I get dressed and look after     
 Sabrina, my sister. At 8.35 I set off 
 for school, I arrive about 8.45. We   
 play out until 9.00, then we go into  
 school. Sometimes we have assembly    
 then we do our reading scheme work and
 maths. At 10.30 we go out to play     
 until 10.45. When we come in we       
 sometimes get on with more maths and  
 then something we want to do. We have 
 dinner at 12.00. After lunch we play  
 rounders and do art. I like playing on
 my roller boots and with my BMX at the
 BMX course.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
