		<content> Within the area there are three       
 main types of employment; general     
 farming, pig farming and              
 horticulture and the jobs             
 available are mainly for male         
 workers.  The majority of people      
 wprking on the land and for the pig   
 rearing unit actually live locally;   
 often  in tied cottages.              
 In Upper Upham there is an arable farm
 of 700 acres which employs farm       
 workers to cultivate the land and tend
 livestock.  The farms are highly      
 mechanised and therefore the actual   
 employment level is low.  A great     
 number of the residents of Upper Upham
 work outside the area; many in more   
 highly paid professions.  There is no 
 public transport so those travelling  
 to work need access to a car,         
 motorbike or bicycle.
