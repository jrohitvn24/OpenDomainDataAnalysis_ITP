		<title>15The Village Hall Bodenham</title>
		<content>  The Village Hall is north-east of the
 A417 about a mile from the centre of  
 the village.Managed by the Parish Hall
 Management Committee, it was built 11 
 years ago in 1974. There is a good car
 park at the side and a field.         
 Every organisation in the village uses
 the hall at some time during the year.
 A lot of clubs meet there regularly - 
 like the guides, badminton, table     
 tennis and gardening club.The play    
 group,run by Janet Price, is held on  
 Mondays and Wednesdays. There is also 
 a toddlers group which is held on     
 Thursdays, and baby clinic.           
  In November, bonfire night is usually
 held on the field and part of an      
 intervillage eisteddfod in the hall.  
  Inside the hall there is a kitchen   
 with a hatch into the hall, ladies and
 gentlemens toilets, a stage, three    
 committee rooms and a large main hall.</content>
