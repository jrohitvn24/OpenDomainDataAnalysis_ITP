		<title>01Summary of area as a whole.</title>
		<content> The block is to the east and north of 
 Pencombe village.It consists of       
 approximately half the village,       
 including the church,school,village   
 hall,post office and Pencombe Hall.   
    There are modern and old buildings 
 in our portion of the village,also    
 some houses are under construction.   
    The area consists mainly of        
 farmland;animals and crops.Most of_   
 the land is grassland, being used     
 for animal grazing.The fields are     
 separated by hedgerows generally.     
 There is only a small area of         
 deciduous woodland.                   
    Because agriculture is the main    
 activity of the block,employment is   
 generally linked to this, in a        
 majority of cases.                    
    Bromyard is the nearest main town. 
 It is four miles from Pencombe.
