		<title>05LAMPLUGH CARAVAN CLUB</title>
		<content> The Caravan Club site is called       
 Dockray Meadow. To use the site you   
 have to be a member of the Caravan    
 Club. The site is 20 years old.       
 Caravans can only stay for 3 weeks. Of
 the 39 plots 6 have electricity. The  
 site is open for 6 months: the week   
 before Easter until the 7th of        
 October. A stay of about 2 weeks for a
 family of four in the peak season     
 costs about Â£30. The charge a night   
 for the pitch is Â£1, adults pay 65p   
 and children pay 30p. Out of season   
 adults pay 45p, children pay 20p. A   
 lot of people come a year after year. 
 The milk costs 23p, eggs cost 94p and 
 aqua kem costs Â£2.30. Aqua kem is a   
 chemical that you put in your portable
 toilets. The heaviest caravan allowed 
 on the site is 1 tonne. There are no  
 toilets or showers in the camp unless 
 you bring your own.                   </content>
