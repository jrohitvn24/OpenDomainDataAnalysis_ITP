 This  school is situated next to the  
 church.                               
                                       
 103 attend aged between 5 and 11.Two  
 temporary class rooms have been added 
 to cope with the extra children from  
 the new houses near the station.      
                                       
 Nearly all the children come to school
 by coach or car, as most of the houses
 are over a mile away at the station.  
                                       
 A new school is planned near these    
 houses.                               
                                       
 After 11 the children can go to school
 in Henley,Stratford,Kenilworth,or     
 Solihull.
