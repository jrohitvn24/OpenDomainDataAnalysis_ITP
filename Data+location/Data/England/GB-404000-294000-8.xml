		<title>08    INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> The manufacturing industry in the     
 block is mostly concentrated in one   
 area. The largest firm employs about  
 200 people and the smallest 4, but    
 most have between 20 and 90 employees.
 Mouldings and castings in plastic and 
 metal are made for things like gears, 
 sprockets, shields, switches and      
 cabinets. Working on electrical and   
 electronic parts is also popular. One 
 firm makes all kinds of special tubing
 while another presses, assembles and  
 plates mounts for jewellery. There is 
 a mixture of older buildings and small
 units in a modern complex. One small  
 printing works is right on the edge of
 the farming area in a converted chapel
 which is over 100 years old. It looks 
 deceptively small from outside but has
 several machines inside. It is a      
 family business, and one man has      
 worked there for over 30 years.       </content>
