		<title>14LAND ARMY AT SWAFFHAM PRIOR</title>
		<content> On Saturday June 29th. 1985, thirty   
 women gathered at Swaffham Prior      
 House. They were there to remember    
 their days in the Land Army some forty
 years ago. This house was their home  
 during the Second World War. Sixty to 
 seventy girls, mostly from the North  
 of England, worked on the land to     
 provide food for the nation. They had 
 a country motto "Dig for Britain." Men
 used to take the women to work in the 
 fen in lorries. They used to pick     
 potatoes, pull carrots and hoe        
 sugarbeet. They got one pound a week  
 in wages but if they became tractor   
 drivers they got two shillings and    
 sixpence (12.5p) extra. The reunion   
 was the idea of the present owner of  
 the house, Mr. Marshall. He found a   
 list of Land Army rules pasted to one 
 of the attic rooms.
