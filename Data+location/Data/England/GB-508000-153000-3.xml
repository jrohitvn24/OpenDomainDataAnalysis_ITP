		<content>  Effingham parish is run by two       
 groups,the{Parochial Church }         
{Council}and the{Effingham             
{Residents and Ratepayers Association.}
  Both have the interests of the       
 development of the village at heart.  
 The E.R.R.A. provides ideas and       
 investigates requests from the        
 residents who want a quiet village    
 with good amenities, while the P.C.C. 
 goes into the viability of these      
 requests. Several meetings are held a 
 year and the job of chairman from both
 groups is to make sure that all       
 matters are discussed. The residents  
 of Effingham want a{chemist}and a few 
 want a{youth club.}Both matters have  
 recently been discussed. The fact that
 there is no{bus service}on the Common 
 Road is also causing concern.         
                                       
                                       </content>
