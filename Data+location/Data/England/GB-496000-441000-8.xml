		<content> (CONT.FROM P.7)the foreseeable future-
 especially as it would be necessary to
 provide a new drainage and sewerage   
 system.The newer houses can be roughly
 divided into homes for the middle/    
 senior management and executive       
 classes and for the skilled artisan   
 and lower management families.The     
 social mix determined by the housing  
 stock available ensures that there is 
 a constant movement of residents,due  
 to promotion or job re-location out of
 (or even within) the village,with     
 younger married couples moving into   
 the village. This should ensure the   
 viability of the school(with the      
 central Government cutbacks in        
 education all village schools are     
 under threat),the village shop and    
 Post Office,but the bus service is at 
 risk with the high ratio of private   
 cars.                                 </content>
