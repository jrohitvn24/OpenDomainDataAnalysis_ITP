		<title>15ACCIDENT RESCUE: ACTON/L'HAM</title>
		<content>In addition to the NHS an Accident     
Rescue Service has been evolved in the 
County of Suffolk to render skilled    
medical help at the scene of any emer- 
gency (road, rail, industrial, farming 
or domestic). Doctors participate in   
the scheme linked by radio to Police   
Fire and Ambulance Service, enabling   
them to reach the scene quickly. In a  
sparsely populated area this is a      
valuable life saving service, and is   
the second largest immediate care      
scheme in the country. There are four  
military bases involved giving the     
added bonus of speedy air transport.   
Doctors participate in the service on  
a voluntary basis and monies for       
equipment etc. are raised by volun-    
tary subscription and fund raising     
activies.
