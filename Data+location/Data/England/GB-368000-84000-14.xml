{1.}MOST PEOPLE SHOPPED IN UPWEY AT    
 LEAST SOME OF THE TIME.               
{2.}WEYMOUTH WAS MORE POPULAR THAN     
 DORCHESTER FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT      
 SHOPPED OUTSIDE UPWEY.                
{3.}THE OPENING OF A NEW SUPERMARKET   
 CLOSE TO UPWEY,HAS SURPRISINGLY NOT   
 AFFECTED THE SHOPPING HABITS OF MOST  
 OF THE LOCALS.
