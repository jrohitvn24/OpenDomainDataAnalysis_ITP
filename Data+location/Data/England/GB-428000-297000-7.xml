		<title>07ST MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>In 1888 St.Mary's Church,Atherstone was
dedicated by the Bishop of Worcester,  
having been rebuilt on the old site in 
1848-50.Originally the Augustinian     
Friars had built the church in the late
14c on land granted by the Prior of    
Merevale.By 1385 they had finished a   
small church and the present chancel.  
Up until 1884 the nave and chancel had 
been separated by a walk-through and   
were linked only after the latter had  
been refurbished,at a cost of 3,500    
pounds which meant that 1,400 people   
could be seated to cater for an        
increased Victorian population.Church  
and Free Grammar School played dual    
roles on the same site and existed for 
300 years.Throughout 1985 further      
restoration work has been undertaken   
with the construction of a Family      
Centre and Coffee Lounge.
