		<content>  I get up at about 7.45 in the        
 morning.                              
 I get dressed then have breakfast of  
 corn_flakes or toast. School starts at
 9 o'clock,and since I live next door,I
 don't have to rush.                   
  I go home at 12 o'clock for dinner,  
 usually something like scrambled      
 eggs or beans on toast.  School ends  
 at 3.30 .I wait for my friend to come 
 home,from Clitheroe at 4.15,then I    
 play with him.We sometimes go to play 
 at our'dens',or,if it is raining,we   
 play on the computer,or at{'Dungeons &amp;
{Dragons'},a fantasy role playing game.
  Once a week I go to{Scouts}in        
 Grindleton where we do lots of        
 different activities like badge-work  
 or we go out and play Wide-games.     
 Sometimes we go on outings and camps. 
  I usually go to bed at about 9       
 o'clock.                              </content>
