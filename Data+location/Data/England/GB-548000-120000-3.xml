		<content>   As you approach the village of      
 Framfield from Uckfield you may just  
 catch a glimpse of Framfield Place.It 
 stands in 3 acres of ground and was   
 built in 1765.An extension was        
 added in 1890 when the last           
 large family (the Baxendales) was in  
 residence.This was designed by Sir    
 Edward Luchens and Sir Norman Shaw.   
   Today the mansion has been divided  
 into six units.Each one of these units
 is rented out separately.One of the   
 lady residents we interviewed told us 
 she used part of the land to grow     
 herbs and plants,which she then sold  
 from a cart at local fetes etc.She was
 also able to tell us that until       
 recently Framfield Place Pond had     
 belonged to the villagers of          
 Framfield.
