		<title>08BELLINGHAM SHOW.</title>
		<content> Bellingham Show takes place each year 
 on the last Saturday in August.       
 It is an agricultural show and        
 includes a country fair. Classes are  
 for horses,sheep,goats,dogs and       
 hounds.                               
 At 7 o'clock I get up,muck out my pony
 and make sure he is all right for the 
 big day.By 9.30 we have arrived at the
 show field which is all ready busy.My 
 sister competes in the handy pony     
 class,her first ever competition.She  
 does not win but says it's taking part
 that matters.At one o'clock we take   
 part in the fancy dress competition   
 dressed up as Zorro and a clown,and we
 both win commended tickets.At about   
 half past three the mounted pony      
 sports begin and we take part and     
 thoroughly enjoy ourselves.We go home 
 tired but happy at the end of a very  
 busy day.                             </content>
