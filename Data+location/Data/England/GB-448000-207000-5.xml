		<title>05The University Parks,Oxford</title>
		<content>The first things we noticed were the   
tall trees.A lot of rare trees have    
been planted there and most have       
labels.We walked down the path and came
to a pond where some ducks were        
nesting.The River Cherwell flows along 
one side of the Parks with the Rainbow 
(or High)Bridge going over it.People   
punt down the river.The most important 
part of the parks was the sports area  
where cricket has been played since    
1881.University teams play County teams
and you can see them free.Next to the  
cricket pitch there is a pavilion which
looks like a large Victorian house.    
  We talked to the Superintendent and  
he told us that the tennis courts were 
changed to a hockey pitch in winter,and
that football and rugby were played at 
the far end of the sports area.
