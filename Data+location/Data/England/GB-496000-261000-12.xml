		<title>12BEDFORD ARMS PUBLIC HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Bedford Arms stands in a prominent
 position in Souldrop high street.  It 
 has a{lounge}and a{bar}at which a     
 variety of alchoholic and soft drinks 
 are available.  For warm days there   
 are seats on the front where you can  
 enjoy your drink and watch people     
 going up and down the street and for  
 those who wish to be more secluded    
 there is a garden at the rear into    
 which drinks may be taken.            
                                       
 The pub has been a feature of the     
 village (on this site) since at       
 least the 1660's. It still maintains  
 its early{character}but unfortunately 
 it lost its thatch in a fire in 1969  
 and it now has a tiled roof.  Most    
 customers nowadays arrive by car and  
 come from Rushden or Bedford for a    
 drink or a{meal}in the country.
