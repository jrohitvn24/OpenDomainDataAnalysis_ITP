		<content>      My farm is called Santa_fe.We    
 used to have pigs, now we have        
 sheep.We had 28 heifers delivered at  
 our other farm at Chobham and we are  
 hay_making. We have two trailers for  
 moving the hay.One is a 40 footer and 
 one a 30 footer.We have a turbo       
 tractor and it has a loader.I drive it
 on the farm it has a grabbing machine 
 and it picks up 8 bales at a time. The
 baler picks up the hay makes it into  
 bales and it puts  the string on the  
 bales.                                
 We have two horses called Bejay and   
 Whitsun . We ride Bejay but Whitsun   
 bucks people off. We had a steer he   
 was friendly and we used to feed him  
 then we sold him, but he was killed. I
 wish we had'nt sold him.We have 8     
 rabbits I look after them and feed    
 them.I like living on the farm.
