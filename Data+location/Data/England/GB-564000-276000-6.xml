    DRAINAGE WORK HAS BEEN GOING ON IN 
THE FENS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. BY THE 
EARLY 19TH CENTURY ALL BUT A FEW AREAS 
HAD BEEN DRAINED AND FARMED. NOWADAYS  
WATER IS MOVED FROM THE FIELDS INTO    
THE RIVERS BY MODERN ELECTRIC PUMPS    
INSTEAD OF WINDMILLS.                  
    WEST ROW IS SITUATED AT THE EDGE OF
THE FENS AND THOUGH SOME OF THE LAND IS
FREE-DRAINING, MOST FARMERS PAY A      
SPECIAL RATE TO THE MILDENHALL FEN     
DRAINAGE BOARD. THE BOARD ORGANISES    
AND  CONTROLS THE LOCAL DRAINAGE, MAIN-
TAINS THE PUMPING STATION AND KEEPS THE
FIELD DRAINS CLEAR.                    
    THIS REGION HAS THE LOWEST RAINFALL
IN THE COUNTRY, AND IRRIGATION IS      
ESSENTIAL FOR MAXIMUM YIELDS.IRONICALLY
MANY FARMERS FIND THEMSELVES PAYING TWO
RATES - ONE TO HAVE WATER TAKEN OFF    
THEIR LAND AND ANOTHER TO PUT IT BACK! </content>
