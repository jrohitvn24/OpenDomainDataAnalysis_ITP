		<title>11WOOLSTON-a farming village.</title>
		<content>   Woolston has a population of about  
 80 people.Nine families are engaged in
 farming.Hill Ash Farm,together with   
 its farm office,is located here and   
 also the Vale of Camelot Growers,the  
 horticultural holding.Cows are        
 'hunted' in ,up the village street,   
 twice a day for milking.              
   Some of the newer bungalows and most
 of the older,smaller cottages in the  
 village are occupied by farm workers  
 while the larger,more substantial     
 properties have been renovated or     
 converted to provide homes for        
 professional people.These include     
 several 17th.century buildings still  
 thatched.                             
   More planting of trees,retention of 
 ponds and maintenance of hedgerows is 
 thought to benefit the area.Generally 
 considered by all to be a pleasent    
 place to lead an unhurried life.      </content>
