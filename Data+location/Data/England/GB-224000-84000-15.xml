		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SHARON.</title>
		<content> Usually I get up at 7.30 in the       
 morning except for Saturdays and      
 Sundays when I can lie on for a couple
 of hours more.When I get out of bed I 
 go and get washed and changed, and    
 then I go and make my bed.After that I
 go downstairs and feed my fish and    
 have my breakfast.Then I go outside   
 and wait for the school bus. I usually
 have to wait for 15 minutes until the 
 bus comes. The bus normally comes     
 between 8.15 and 8.30, but on Tuesdays
 it comes at 8.00 because we go        
 swimming in Launceston Pool at 9.00.  
 When the bus comes I go straight to   
 the back because I sit in the back.It 
 normally takes us a little more than  
 15 minutes to get to school.At 10.30  
 we have playtime and at 12.00 we have 
 dinner. At 3.15 we get ready to go    
 home and I go home on the bus as well.
 We normally get home at 3.45p.m.      </content>
