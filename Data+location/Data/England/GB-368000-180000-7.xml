		<content> We wanted to find out how long most   
 people have lived in{Yate}and why     
 they moved here.We took home          
 questionaires and asked our parents   
 and people we knew.We found that 52%  
 of the people we asked had lived here 
 for over 10 years,22% for less than   
 5 years and 27% had lived in{Yate}for 
 between 5 and 10 years.Most people had
 moved here because there is a wide    
 range of low cost housing,but         
 employment nearby,families nearby,    
 the facilities in{Yate}and the        
 nearness of{Bristol}were also         
 important.
