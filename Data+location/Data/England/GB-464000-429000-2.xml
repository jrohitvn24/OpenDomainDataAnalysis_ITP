		<content> The nature of the land is low-lying;  
 nowhere is it elevated above 10 metres
 above sea-level. It is the flood plain
 of the tidal{River Ouse.}The land has 
 been improved through electical       
 pumping, and artificial flood banks   
 have enabled the area to be used for  
 intensive arable farming.             
 Settlements tend to follow the higher 
 natural features such as river        
 cliffs.                               
 There is concern about the effects    
 of extensive development in the area  
 and efforts are being made to provide 
 conservation areas.                   
 Its position at the bottom of the{Vale
{of York}protects this area from some  
 of the extremes of British climate.   
 The proximity of the area to the{Power
{Stations of Drax and Eggborough}is a  
 source of concern in relation to the  
 problems of pollution.                </content>
