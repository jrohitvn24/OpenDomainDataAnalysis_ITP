		<title>01MAIN FEATURES OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> Our area around the village of{Ewyas  
{Harold}is in the county of{Hereford,  
 in{England}but the border of{Wales}is 
 very close.                           
  Geographicaly the area is very       
 interesting, with the high long narrow
 ridge of the{Black Mountains}forming a
 natural border to the west. This high 
 ridge and the hills and valleys       
 immediately around our village were   
 formed by glacial action during the   
 ice age.                              
  Our area has three villages the      
 largest is{Ewyas Harold,}and the      
 others are quite small{-Dulas         
 and{Abbey Dore.                       
  Two rivers run through the area and  
 eventually join the{River Monnow .}The
 valley of the{River Dore}between Ewyas
 Harold and{Abbey Dore}is wide and     
 fertile. It is called the{Golden      
{Valley.                               </content>
