		<content> When we were at the old school the    
 classrooms were mobiles,but Mrs Bees  
 class was made with sheets of metal.We
 did not have assembly.We had to go    
 into a classroom.We kept our P.E.     
 equipment in a shed.There was not a   
 dinner hall so we had to have our     
 dinner in our classrooms.The toilets  
 were not in the classrooms they were  
 at the other side of the              
 playground.There were no taps in our  
 classrooms you had to go to the       
 brickroom to wash your brushes after  
 using them.There was a little kitchen 
 and there was not a staffroom.The     
 teachers had coffee in the            
 office.There was a bike shed and quite
 a big playground and field.
