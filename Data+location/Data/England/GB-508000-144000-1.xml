 St.Mary and Abinger lie in fertile    
 valleys on the Greensand of the richly
 wooded hills of South West Surrey.    
 To the south of Peaslake is Pitch Hill
 rising to 800 feet with views across  
 the Weald.   While to the south of    
 Holmbury St. Mary is Holmbury Hill -

 North and South Downs.
