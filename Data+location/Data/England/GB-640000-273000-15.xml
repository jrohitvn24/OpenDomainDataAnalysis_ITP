		<title>15Families - Mark</title>
		<content>I am 7 years old and my name is Mark   
Hardacre. I live on Blackheath in a new
house that was built by Jo Sinden's    
dad. I have a sister called Stacey who 
is 5. We used to live in Great Cornard,
near Sudbury. My dad is a manager for  
Everest Double Glazing, and his name is
John: my Mum is called Beverley. We    
have two cars, one is a Jaguar and one 
is a Prarie. I am not very big, but I  
like eating so I will grow. My         
favourite food is steak and kidney     
pie, but I hate eggs. I like school    
which is Wenhaston Primary and I like  
maths, English, reading and topic work.
My favourite book is Grimm's Fairy     
Tales. But I like all books. One of my 
Grannies lives in Italy, and the other 
lives in Sudbury. I am going to Italy  
for Christmas. My Asthma is better when
I am in Italy.
