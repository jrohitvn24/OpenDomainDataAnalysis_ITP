		<title>11WETHERBY POPULATION CHANGES</title>
		<content>  Although there have been some decades
 of population decrease{(1801-11, 1861-
{71, 1881-91, 1911-21 and 1951-61)}the 
 town of Wetherby has seen a vast      
 growth in its population from 1144 in 
 1801 to 9725 in 1981. Most of this    
 growth has taken place in recent      
 years. The population increased by    
 over 75% between 1961-71{(4179}to     
{7332)}and by over 32% between 1971-81 
 to reach{9725.                        
  The enormous recent increase is due  
 to Wetherby becoming a{commuter town  
 for Leeds, Harrogate and York. Large  
 numbers of people have moved into new 
 private housing developments (built by
 firms such as{Barratt, Comben and     
{Ideal)}in the north and west. Concern 
 has been expressed at the loss of     
 agricultural land to such developments
 and this is clearly shown by the      
 present debate over{Hill Top Farm.    </content>
