		<title>19The Games We Play.</title>
		<content> We play a lot of games.As many as you 
 want can play blocky.One person is on 
 block and we use a post as a block.The
 one who is on counts,and when he has  
 finished counting he has to find      
 someone ,run and touch the block      
 first.He has to say"Block 1,2,3".     
   Polo is a game where someone who is 
 on names a subject like boys'         
 names.The other people choose a name  
 and one person shouts them out.The    
 person who is on chooses one and the  
 person whose name it is has to race   
 against him.The one who wins is on.   
  We also play red letter,tallyho,and  
 bulldog.The girls like playing a      
 bottle of beer where you have to      
 decide ,apart from one person out of  
 the ring who they go with,and then    
 you come inside the ring.You then     
 shout who they go with.Then you break 
 the hands up,and push somebody in.    </content>
