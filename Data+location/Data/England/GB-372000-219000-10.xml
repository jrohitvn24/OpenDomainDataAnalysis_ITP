		<title>10A Saturday With My Family.</title>
		<content>   At half past seven we get up and    
 have breakfast and then get dressed.  
 When we are ready my brother ,sister  
 and I go out in the garden and play on
 our bikes or play in our den.         
   At one o'clock my mum calls us in   
 for a snack.At two o'clock I play     
 with my friend,Marion,and we go for a 
 walk to the workman's hut.We climb on 
 top and slide down the sides which is 
 good fun.After that we go and play at 
 my house.                             
   When we get tired of playing in the 
 garden we go for a bike ride.At half  
 five it is time for me to go home for 
 tea.                                  
   After tea I play Monopoly with my   
 mum and dad.I go to bed about ten     
 p.m., about an hour later than usual. 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
