		<title>12HOUSING IN HALWELL&amp;MORELEIGH</title>
		<content> Halwell and Moreleigh have grown      
 piecemeal,expanding and retracting    
 with the economic clime.  The houses  
 are difficult to date because         
 additions and adaptions have blurred  
 outlines, but Stanborough House goes  
 back to the 16thC.,as do many of the  
 farms and 1777 is inscribed on        
 another,whilst many were built during 
 Victorian times.  Most houses are     
 stone,some plastered and painted,but  
 none are thatched.  Farms in the      
 outlying areas have,inaddition to the 
 farmhouse,cottages to house workers.  
 The style and size of the houses      
 indicates a working peasantry rather  
 than leisured gentry.  Each village   
 has 6 Council houses.  There are plans
 to build 14/16 houses and bungalows   
 and property coming on to the open    
 market is quickly sold.
