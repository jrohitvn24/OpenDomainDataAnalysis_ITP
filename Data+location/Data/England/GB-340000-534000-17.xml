 District form the backbone of social  
 activity and they are many and varied 
 considering the small population. The 
 Village Hall and its committee are    
 fundamental to many activities as the 
 premises are used by many organis-    
 ations. The building is available for 
 private hire.                         
 The re-formed Bowls Club (1982) use   
 the Green behind the Hall and the     
 Playgroup, Youth Club, Women's        
 Institute and Over 60's meet in the   
 Hall. Other groups are connected with 
 the School and include the Young Orni 
 -thologist's Club, the Parent Teacher 
 Association and the Village Swimming  
 Club. The Young Farmer's Club and the 
 Agricultural &amp; Horticultural Society
