		<title>16Stanbrook Abbey.</title>
		<content>  The Malvern_Worcester area has been a
 popular part of the county for        
 clusters of monastic houses over the  
 centuries,but now the only remaining  
 example is at Callow End.             
  The Benedictine community was started
 in 1623 by 9 young English women,     
 forced to move to Flanders. They      
 returned to England and stayed in     
 Warwickshire, until moving to a new   
 Gothic_Revival building at Callow End 
 in 1835.                              
  The monastic enclosure had 19 acres  
 of orchards,fields,a garden,a pond,and
 the brook that gave the site its name.
  The 50 sisters follow the traditional
 elements in Benedict's daily routine, 
 but also have time for recreational   
 pursuits. Some of the tasks they do at
 Stanbrook include caring for the sick,
 weaving,woodcarving,writing,printing, 
 translating,making paper and cooking. </content>
