		<title>02HOUSING IN N.FERRIBY.</title>
		<content>  In North Ferriby well over 100 houses
 are semi-detached, with over 50       
 detached houses. There are hardly any 
 flats in the village and very few     
 bungalows. A vast majority of the     
 houses in the village are between 60  
 and 100 years old. The oldest house in
 Ferriby is around 886 years old. Most 
 of  the houses are owner occupied with
 very few rented and none are leased.  
  In Ferriby many people have moved    
 here in the last 25 years for various 
 reasons, like jobs and the surrounding
 countryside. A few have lived here    
 all their lives. On average 4 people  
 live in each house in North Ferriby,  
 the highest being 8 in one house. Most
 of the children go to North Ferriby   
 school. Unfortunately there are quite 
 a few unemployed people.Many people in
 Ferriby seem to belong to the         
 professional job categories.          </content>
