		<content> It all depended how well off you were.
 If you were very poor as we were in   
 those days if there was an old pair   
 that anybody didn't want you'd wear   
 them; that's the only glasses{we}had. 
 I've known my Mother many times pick  
 up anybody else's glasses and try to  
 see what she wants to see with them.  
 Couldn't afford any glasses.          
{Did you wear lipstick?                
 No! My! Never heard of that in our    
 days. Lipstick! But I'll tell you what
 we used to do if we were going out. As
 I said we'd have a little bit of      
 powder to put around our face and a   
 little bit of rouge. I don't know if  
 you know what rouge is, it came in a  
 little box, it's a red powder.        
{Did you have your ears pierced?       
 No, didn't have ears pierced.         
{Did you have a bike?                  
 No.                                   </content>
