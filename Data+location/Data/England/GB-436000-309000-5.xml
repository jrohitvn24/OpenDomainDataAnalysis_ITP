		<content> I go to a club called the Brigade.  We
 meet at 6 p.m. on Mondays.   Each     
 evening lasts until 8.00 p.m.  When we
 get there we line up and pay our sub, 
 which is 15p.  After this we work at  
 our project.  Once you complete a     
 project you get a badge.  Sometimes   
 we go on visits to the seaside or we  
 go camping.  We have to go to church  
 on the second Sunday of each month.   
 We have an annual Parade.  This year  
 we went to Leicester Cathedral for a  
 service, and afterwards we went       
 outside to march around the city.  We 
 do have a uniform.  It consists of a  
 navy skirt with a navy top.  The girls
 have to wear a white sash which has a 
 gold ring at the bottom.  We have red 
 ties, blue ties and green ties.  I am 
 in the red section.
