		<title>09Tipton People</title>
		<content> From a survey we have carried out, we 
 found that most people have lived in  
 Tipton all their lives and many would 
 not think of moving. We are a         
 closely-knit community and many of the
 people living here are proud to say   
 they come from Tipton.  We have a     
 distinctive Black Country accent which
 is easily recognised wherever we go.  
 Although there are some bad things    
 about living in an urban  area like   
 Tipton, such as litter, pollution from
 the factories, busy roads and dangers 
 from railways and canals, there are   
 some advantages as well.  We like to  
 think our neighbours are friendly     
 people,and living in this area means  
 things like shops,schools and some    
 jobs are handy.We also have good bs   
 and rail services and are close to the
 motrway network and green belt.
