		<title>01PENWORTHAM A PRESTON SUBURB</title>
		<content>PENWORTHAM though mentioned in the     
original Domesday Book,is now regarded 
 s a suburb of Preston.It is divided   
from Preston by the River Ribble and   
crossing the river is a major problem  
for commutors.A new bridge across the  
 iver has been a most welcome          
development of the 1980's.There is now 
alot less traffic congeston  at peak   
 imes of the day.The area includes the 
site of an old Priory,after which  the 
local County Comprehensive is          
named.There is also an old Endowed     
Grammer School at Hutton,one mile from 
Penwortham.The headquarters for        
Lancashire Police is also in the       
area.This has an accident centre for   
the North West.Penwortham is a pleasant
mixture of modern houses and           
farmland.It has an interesting history 
and hopefully a prosperous future.
