		<content> The area is on a bed-rock of sandstone
 overlaid by a flat clay plain with low
 hills of sand and gravel,deposited    
 during the Pleistocene period of the  
 Ice Age.                              
   There are no obvious geological     
 features of any significance;at first 
 sight the countryside appears flat and
 featureless,but every dip and hollow  
 was significant to the first settlers 
 to the area.When the River Ouse floods
 it can be seen that the sites for     
 early settlements were chosen wisely. 
    The Saxon farmers,who came up the  
 river in search of land to cultivate, 
 made their homes near water for ease  
 of transport,but because of the threat
 of flooding they sited their villages 
 on strategic promontaries of sand and 
 gravel.Such sites are to be found at  
 Newton-on-Ouse and Linton-on-Ouse.
