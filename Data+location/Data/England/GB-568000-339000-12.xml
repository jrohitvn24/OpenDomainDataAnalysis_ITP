		<title>12THE GHOST OF HUNSTANTON HALL</title>
		<content> In the 18th century Hunstanton Hall   
 was owned by Armine Styleman.She owned
 a persian carpet which was a present  
 from the Shah.Her last words were that
 it remain in the family.It was packed 
 away and forgotten,until someone who  
 did not know of the request had the   
 carpet cut up and distributed to the  
 villagers.Armine's ghost then haunted 
 the Hall with much ferocity until the 
 carpet was restored to its former home
 Since then the ghost has kept a quiet 
 watch to see that the same thing does 
 not happen again.Similar stories with 
 minor variations are told about other 
 haunted houses in Britain.            
 The Norfolk coast is a favourite haunt
 of Black Shuck.An enormous phantom    
 hound with fiery eyes which vanishes  
 with a clap of thunder. It is also    
 seen in other parts of Britain under  
 local names such as the Mauthie Dhoog.</content>
