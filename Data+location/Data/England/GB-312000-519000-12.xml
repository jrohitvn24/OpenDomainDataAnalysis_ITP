		<content> Farms are privately owned except 2    
 held by the N.T. 5 are let on an      
 annual agricultural tenancy. Picket   
 How is owner occupied. Fodder crops   
 grown are silage, hay, some barley &amp;  
 turnips. Small amounts of foods are   
 bought in. As well as sheep, suckler  
 beef herds are kept at Godferhead and 
 High Cross. Calves reared are sold at 
 8-12 months. Dairy farming is carried 
 out at Godferhead &amp; Pickett How,      
 Friesans being the main breed. Milk   
 produced is collected daily by M.M.B. 
 tankers. Crossbred calves from beef   
 bulls are sold, as followers aren't   
 kept.Auction markets used: Penrith,   
 Cockermouth, Troutbeck and Carlisle.  
 Farmers use no hired labour except for
 silage and shearing contractors. Field
 boundaries are mainly dry stone walls,
 but fell enclosures of post &amp; wire are
 now superseding walls.                </content>
