		<title>09ST. PETER'S CHURCH, HENFIELD</title>
		<content>   There are several places of worship 
 in Henfield.  Within the Parish       
 boundaries are two belonging to the   
 Church of England.  Both are  called  
 St. Peter's.                          
     St. Peter's Church, Henfield.     
   The Church is quite old.  It is     
 built in the shape of a cross.  Inside
 the Church there is a Children's      
 Corner with a font.  Every first      
 Sunday in the month we have Church    
 Parade, I attend this service as a    
 Brownie. There is a large Bell-ringing
 gallery.  The villagers are designing 
 and making hassocks for the church.   
 They show local flowers, animals and  
 birds.  They are very pretty.  There  
 is a very old chest in the Church.  It
 had some very old documents in it.    
 The Parish Magazine will be 100 years 
 old in 1986. The Church is surrounded 
 by yew trees.  It is pretty.          </content>
