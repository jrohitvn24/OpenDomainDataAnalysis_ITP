		<title>08RUDDINGTON PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content>{RUDDINGTON}has seven public houses    
 which is a lot for the size of the    
 village.The {RED LION,}the{RED HEART  
 and the {THREE CROWNS}are called Top, 
 Middle and Bottom house because they  
 are so close together on Easthorpe    
 Street.The{RED LION}used to be in     
 Vicarage Lane but the vicar in        
 Victorian Times did not like it near  
 the Vicarage.                         
 The{BRICKLAYERS ARMS,}the{JOLLY       
{FARMERS} the {VICTORIA TAVERN }and the
{WHITE HORSE}all have seats outside so 
 that children can be with their       
 parents when they go for a drink.     
 Morris Dancing sometimes takes place  
 outside these pubs.                   
 Most of these pubs were started in    
 Victorian times when the village had a
 large population working in the       
 Framework Knitting Industry.Now people
 come by car to enjoy a village pub.   </content>
