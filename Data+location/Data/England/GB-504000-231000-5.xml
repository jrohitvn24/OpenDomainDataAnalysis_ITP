		<title>05OUR SCHOOL TRIP</title>
		<content>   Each year we all go on a trip.This  
 year we went on a coach to Bekonscot  
 Model Village and the Courage Shire   
 Horse Centre near Maidenhead.         
  At the Model Village we saw lots of  
 old houses and shops.One was Marks and
 Spencer, that brought a laugh.There   
 was a lake with a pier and a water    
 wheel.Railways ran all round the      
 village.                              
  Next we went to the Shire Horse      
 Centre.We were introduced to all the  
 horses in turn.Barley was a popular   
 horse she has appeared on T.V. and    
 films.We watched a farrier shoeing    
 Barley.One horse refuses to be shod so
 cannot work yet.Each working horse    
 weighs about 1 ton and can pull 2     
 tons.Sometimes 4 horses pull 8 tons of
 Courage beer.
