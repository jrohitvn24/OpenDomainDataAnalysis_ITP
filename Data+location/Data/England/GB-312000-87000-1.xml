		<content>{ Sidmouth}is an outstanding example of
 the English coastal resort town as it 
 developed during and after the        
 Napoleonic Wars. Because it was not   
 swamped by development in the later   
 19th Century, it is a relatively      
 unspoilt example of its type and      
 retains its essentially spacious      
 character of a town of villas and     
 terraces set in an outstanding        
 landscape.                            
  The physical beauty of Sidmouth's    
 setting is very impressive. The narrow
 Sid valley ends abruptly in a shingle 
 ridge between huge red sandstone      
 cliffs that rise to over 500 feet to  
 the east and west. The relative       
 steepness of these surrounding hills  
 is vital to Sidmouth; it has kept the 
 sea front free of building to the east
 of the Esplanade, providing a contrast
 of urban building with the red cliffs.</content>
