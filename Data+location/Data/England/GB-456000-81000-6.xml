		<content>{Shanklin Pier was completed in 1891   
{and Sandown Pier was completed in     
 1907.They were both built as tourists 
 attractions in Victorian times.The    
 main structure of the piers is iron   
 and wood.As the piers deteriorate they
 become increasingly expensive to      
 maintain.Both piers remain tourist    
 attractions despite an entry fee of   
 10p at Shanklin.                      
 Shanklin and Sandown piers have many  
 attractions today.Each has a theatre, 
 Sandown theatre being the larger and  
 attracting famous stars,whereas       
 Shanklin is smaller and ofen used for 
 local functions.Each has an amusement 
 arcade and cafe of some kind.There are
 facilities for fishing at the end of  
 each pier.
