		<title>13E.Malling Research Station</title>
		<content> E.M.R.S is funded by the Agricultural 
 and Food Research Council and is the  
 main fruit research station in the UK.
 Woody plants studied are apple, pear, 
 cherry and plum. Soft fruits studied  
 are strawberry, raspberry, gooseberry,
 loganberry, red and black currant.    
 Investigations into hop diseases and  
 pests are carried out and some work is
 done on ornamental shrubs. Better     
 fruit storage methods are developed.  
 The main aim is to help growers to    
 produce top quality fruit. 135        
 scientists and 185 other workers      
 are employed. The station has about   
 580 acres of land, most of which is   
 used for experimental orchards,       
 nurseries and glasshouses. E.M.R.S is 
 known world-wide and overseas         
 officials, growers and students are   
 frequent visitors.
