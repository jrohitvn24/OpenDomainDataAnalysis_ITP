<content>

On Saturday 18th June we went to medieval day at Eltham palace. We saw a falconry display with a kestrel and an eagle.&lt;br />&lt;br />After this we were entertained by the Jester we played lots of games and then at the end of the day  we were all excited to see the jousting , hoping that the blue knight  would win but he didnâ€™t he came second at the end of the day we was all very tired.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
