		<title>03HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Many years ago a hospital was built in
 Wingland near the River Nene.It was a 
 special fever hospital for any sailors
 who were taken ill on the ships that  
 sailed up the river.The idea was that 
 if any of the men had a fever they    
 could be taken of the ship and put    
 into the fever hospital so that the   
 disease would not spread to the other 
 sailors or tothe people of Sutton     
 Bridge. From what we can find out     
 about the hospital it seems that it   
 has only been used once. It was pulled
 down 2 years back.So that is why the  
 road is called hospital road.
