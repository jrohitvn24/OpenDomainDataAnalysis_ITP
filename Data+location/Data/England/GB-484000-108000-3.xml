 St Nicholas is a Saxon church with a  
 Victorian arch.In 1980 it was restored
 inside and all but the Medieval pews  
 were removed.The church was furnished 
 just with chairs and an altar and is  
 used for many purposes,social and     
 religious.An extension to the church  
 is planned.During the restoration the 
 famous lost statue of Dame Mary       
 May,1671,by John Bushnel was found in 
 a vault under the floor.
