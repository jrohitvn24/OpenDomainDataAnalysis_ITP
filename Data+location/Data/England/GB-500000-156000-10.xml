		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content>{Roundbridge Farm.}On the 20th of June 
 1985 we went to Roundbridge Farm.     
 First we went into the sheds to have a
 look at the equipment that Mr Elcock, 
 the farmer, uses. Mr Elcock has 250   
 acres which he manages on his own.    
 This is why he has so much machinery. 
 Mr Elcock took us around the farm on a
 trailer pulled by a tractor. We sat on
 bales of hay. The fields are used to  
 grow crops. These are oats, barley,   
 beans, wheat and grass for hay. The   
 bean plants had a disease called      
 chocolate spot. All the plants had    
 been sprayed lately for pests and     
 weeds. Mr Elcock sells his oats for   
 porrige. He sells the hay to a        
 neighbouring farmer. The wheat and    
 barley are sold to merchants and the  
 beans are sold for cattle food. The   
 farm is next to a golf course. We saw 
 a lot of flowers and different grasses</content>
