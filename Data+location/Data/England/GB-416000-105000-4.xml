		<title>04The School Cross Country Run</title>
		<content>   Every year since 1980, thirty boys  
 and thirty girls aged 10 or 11 years  
 go to{Linford Bottom}for the annual{  
{Ringwood Junior School}cross country  
 run.                                  
   We run over grassy land between     
 trees and there are lots of ditches to
 jump over. The course is marked by    
 flags which you have to keep on your  
 right as you run. Towards the end the 
 boys splash through a stream.         
   Someone signals the start with a gun
 and there are marshalls around the    
 course to help the runners. At the    
 finish runners are handed numbered    
 cards to indicate in which position   
 they finish and they gain points for  
 their House at school.                
   Trophies are presented to the       
 winning boy and girl. We all go home  
 by coach or with our parents feeling  
 hot and tired. The run is good fun.   </content>
