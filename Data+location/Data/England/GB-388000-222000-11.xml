 semi-detached. Most are in the south  
 east square.                          
 The majority of the houses are gas    
 centrally heated although a few use   
 electricity or oil. Nearly all the    
 house are owner occupied and are less 
 than 30 years old. There are many new 
 estates. The average in family is 4.  
 Most have at least one car. About 30% 
 have double glazing. About 20% are    
 council owned.Over 50% of the people  
 were born in the Cheltenham area.Most 
 people have lived in their houses for 
 7-15 years, and many for 2-6 years.
