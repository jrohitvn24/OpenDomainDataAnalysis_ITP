		<content>      {CALBOURNE MILL}owned by the     
 Weeks family since 1878 is now a      
 Show-place and Tourist Attraction.  It
 is built of stone with all the        
 equipment for milling still in working
 order.  The Roller Mill equipment     
 installed in 1894 is still in situ.   
 The various outbuildings used for     
 storage etc. are now used for Museums 
 of rural life in days gone by and as a
 cafe with shopping area.              
  {    FULLING MILL,}now a stone built 
 farmhouse, is on the site of the      
 original mill, out of action before   
 1800, but used for treating cloth     
 woven on the Island. The house retains
 many old features such as beams and   
 open hearth fireplaces but no clear   
 signs of its milling origin.
