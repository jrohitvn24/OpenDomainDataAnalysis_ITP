     Cookley's school was built over   
 one hundred years ago. Although it is 
 run by the Hereford and Worcester     
 Education Authority, it is aided      
 financially by the {Sebright Trustees.
     Originally the school catered for 
 pupils upto the statutory leaving     
 age,firstly 12 the 14. On building a  
 Secoindary school at Sion Hill near { 
{Wolverly ,}Cookley became a           
 Primary(5-11) school. Under           
 reorganisation in the county in 1973  
 Cookley became a First (5-9) school.  
 At present it has just 100 pupils and 
 4 staff. At 9 years of age the        
 children leave the intimacy of the    
 small village school to go to SION    
 HILL Middle School,which also takes   
 its pupils from                       
 Wolverly,Blakedown,Churchill and the  
 outskirts of Kidderminster.           </content>
