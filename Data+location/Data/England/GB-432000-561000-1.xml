		<content>    The designated area, primarily     
 residential, was until the 1950's a   
 green belt between the main townships 
 of{Hebburn}and{South Shields.       } 
    Housing, mainly council, is in     
 large estates.{Boldon Colliery,}a     
 typical northern Victorian colliery   
 settlement, is an exception to the    
 pattern. The area is traversed        
 by the{A1T, A194 (Newcastle-South     
{Shields Road)}and the{Newcastle to    
{Sunderland Railway.                   
    Farmland covers almost one-third of
 the area, most of it in the south-west
 of the block.                         
    Employment patterns have changed in
 recent years with the closure of      
 traditional industries.               
    There is increasing provision by   
 the community for the elderly and for 
 recreation.
