		<title>10HOME LIFE 1.</title>
		<content>   Traditional home life is undergoing 
a revolution in the urban part of the  
area. In 20 years it has moved from the
basis of husband as breadwinner, to    
husband and wife working, to husband   
and wife not working. Marriages have   
become less stable and there has been  
a large increase in one parent families
   Is it the economic situation or the 
low value put on family life by        
Society?                               
   The obvious results are the high    
proportion of separations or divorce or
couples just living together; the less 
obvious results are manifest in the    
behaviour patterns of children and the 
psychological problems arising from the
many tensions they face. There has been
a sharp increase in the number of      
children Â£at risk'.                    
   Lack of purpose or future in life is
undermining the traditional disciplines</content>
