The Bell and Bottle restaurant (29 44) 
is supposed to be haunted. It is well  
over 200 years old and various bumps   
are supposed to occur at times.        
Occasionally crockery has been         
unaccountably broken, and a previous   
inhabitant said that rooms felt chilly.
GHOSTS IN THE OPEN                     
A story persists that the ghost of a   
Roman soldier walks on the ground above
the Roman road in 31 45 on occasions,  
but no-one has claimed to have seen it.
E.S.P. &amp; DIVININGS                     
Several people in the area claim to    
have E.S.P. but nobody practises it for
monetary gains.Several people are      
diviners; the chairman of Lund         
Historical Society has used his powers 
to help locate Roman and other ancient 
tracks, vanished builings, undergound  
streams and drains.                    </content>
