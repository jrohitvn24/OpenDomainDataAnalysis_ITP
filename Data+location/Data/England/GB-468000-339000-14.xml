		<content>    RAF Newton is one of the only two  
 remaining RAF stations in             
 Nottinghamshire. It is situated at the
 side of the A46. It was first built   
 in 1936 and was used by Bomber Command
 during the war. It is now used as a   
 training centre and is the home of the
 national training school for RAF      
 police dogs. There are dog trials held
 every summer for the best service dog.
    For the training of pilots two     
 types of aircraft are used:- the      
 Chipmunk and the Bulldog.             
    There are housing facilities for   
 200 families on the base. There is a  
 gym and a sports field, a church and  
 various shops. There is a nursery for 
 younger children but older children   
 go to local schools. Also on the base 
 there are 2 social clubs, a youth     
 club, and activities such as scouts,  
 guides and an A.T.C. group.           </content>
