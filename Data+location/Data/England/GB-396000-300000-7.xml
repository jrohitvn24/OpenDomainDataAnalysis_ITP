		<title>07Walk by the Essington Canal</title>
		<content> When we got to the Perry Hall Bridge  
 we crossed the road to get to the     
 towpath.There was lots of rubbish in  
 the canal such as tyres,prams and milk
 crates.The bricks under the canal show
 that it had been replaced by a new    
 one.On the other side of the canal the
 land was marshy and there were also   
 some gardens called allotments.Further
 up the canal there was an overflow and
 then we came to Pool Hayes Bridge,    
 which we could tell was old because of
 the brickwork.We then came to a bridge
 called Knightsbridge which had bricks 
 underneath to stop the horses which   
 used to pull the barges from slipping.
 In the canal we saw fish such as      
 minnows and sticklebacks and also two 
 swans.We also saw some water-lilies   
 and marsh marigolds.Further up the    
 canal there were some factories which 
 made metal rods.                      </content>
