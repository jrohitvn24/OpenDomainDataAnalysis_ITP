		<content>{The Beeches School}opened in 1983     
 following the amalgamation of an      
 infant and a junior school. The school
 has a roll of 450 pupils with 49      
 adults working in a variety of ways.  
 Almost 90% of the pupils are of       
 Pakistani origin _ mainly from the    
 Mirpur region of Pakistan.            
                                       
  The school serves an area with a rich
 cultural mix which includes Pakistani 
 muslims, Indians _ both Sikh and Hindu
 Afro-Carribean families, Italians,    
 Vietnamese and English. The area      
 reflects this mix in its places of    
 worship and its shops.                
                                       
  The local community makes use of the 
 school premises in a variety of ways  
 and the children in the school use the
 community and local environment in    
 their studies.                        </content>
