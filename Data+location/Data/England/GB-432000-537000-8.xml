		<title>08QUARRINGTON HILL CHURCH</title>
		<content> We walked along church road to        
 St.Pauls church. We talked to the     
 vicar. The church  is away from the   
 village because there used to be      
 houses called Cold Knuckles along     
 church road.The church was built of   
 stone in 1868.The organ was made by   
 Nelson of Durham .The church has 1    
 bell cast in 1868 but no spire or     
 tower. Mr.Stringer looks after        
 Bowburn church as well. There are 12  
 marriages and 6 burials per year.     
 There are 2 church wardens. They help 
 with special collections by envelope  
 which raise Â£140 per week. The vicar  
 often organizes outings and also      
 visits old people. He has been vicar  
 for 18 years . There have been 11     
 diffrent vicars since 1868.           
 The average congregation for the whole
 parish is 112 people per week.
