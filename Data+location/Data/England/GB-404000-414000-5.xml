		<content> The housing pattern in this block is  
 one of contrast.In 11 of the 12       
 kilometre-squares, the housing density
 is very light comprising of scattered,
 even isolated, properties.A partial   
 exception to this pattern occurs in   
 the south-east kilometre square       
 covering the HillTop suburb of        
 Slaithwaite where there are around 400
 houses extending westwards along      
 Longlands Road in a broad ribbon      
 development.The majority of these     
 properties are terraced houses with   
 small gardens, built in the 1890's or 
 early 1900's.There are a mixture of   
 semi-detached and terraced houses on  
 the Longlands Council Estate.         
 In rural areas no new house building  
 is permitted.Barn conversions and the 
 renovation of farm property dating    
 back to the late 1700's is allowed, if
 traditional stone and slate is used.  </content>
