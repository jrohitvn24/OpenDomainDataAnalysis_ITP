		<title>19GENERAL TRENDS,DRAYTON AREA</title>
		<content>   {Drayton,Taverham and Costessey}as  
 a whole provide a very accurate       
 indication of the current trends that 
 prevail in{East Anglia in 1985.}The   
 area has seen new developments in     
{housing, industry}and in the job      
 situation,being at present comfortably
 prosperous while much of the country  
 is suffering from economic recession  
 and unemployment.{Farming}is,as ever, 
 a major factor in Norfolk, but much of
 the traditional industry has given way
 to mechanisation and the growth of the
 service industries.The area has seen a
 lot of{foreign investment}particularly
 from the Low Countries, as well as the
 emergence of North Sea oil and gas as 
 a major employer.The area has lost    
 much of its{former rural charm}and is 
 in danger of becoming a sprawling     
 suburb as more houses are built to    
 cater for the influx of people.       </content>
