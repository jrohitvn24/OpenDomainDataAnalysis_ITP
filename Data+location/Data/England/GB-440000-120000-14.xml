 In the area near our school we carried
 out a house survey. First of all we   
 surveyed the houses in Highfield Road.
 Most of them were semi-detached with  
 tiles. They had walls of brick and    
 tiles. Some tiles were made of stone  
 and some of the bricks were painted.  
                                       
         {Winchester Road              
                                       
 There are many different houses in    
 Winchester Road. They are detached    
 houses, detached bungalows and        
 semi-detached houses. The numbers on  
 the houses start at 93 and work       
 downwards towards Bodycoates Road.    
 Most of the houses are built of brick.
