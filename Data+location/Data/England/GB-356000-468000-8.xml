		<title>08The Police and Fire Service</title>
		<content>Hornby has a village policeman who is  
responsible for the area concerned     
here. He has a large degree of autonomy
and he can choose which hours to be on 
duty. As he is expected to work mainly 
on his own, he is trained to cope with 
a wide variety of situations. Public   
relations is very important in a small 
community and he is often asked for    
advice. The village policeman is       
responsible for the issue of licences, 
rgarding the movement of livestock and 
for firearms.                          
Hornby has a small fire station and    
several retained firemen. Each person  
carries a personal receiver which      
alerts the firemen whenever they are   
required. The first six men to report  
to the station will man the fire       
engine. There is, on average, one call 
per week, which may be a fire, flood,  
road accident or rescuing animals.     </content>
