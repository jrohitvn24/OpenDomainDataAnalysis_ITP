		<content>    At the northern edge of the block  
 the land is low lying and at about 5m 
 above sea level forms part of the     
{Somerset Levels}or{moors.             
    The River Brue is at the north-east
 edge of our area and only a few small 
 streams and man-made ditches, called  
   rhynes in Somerset, drain into it,  
 including the{Bullmead Ditch}and the  
{Small Moor Rhyne.                     
    We have two primary{schools}in our 
 area Brookside and Walton, and one    
 special school, Avalon.   At the age  
 of eleven children from Brookside and 
 Walton go to Crispin secondary school 
 at the eastern end of the town of     
 Street.                               
    The older buildings in this area   
 are constructed from{Blue Lias,}a kind
 of limestone,  but buiding since the  
 sixties has largely been in brick or  
 in reconstituted stone.               </content>
