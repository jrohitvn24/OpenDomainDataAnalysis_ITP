		<title>08THE SCHOOL BARBECUE</title>
		<content> We all long for the end of term       
 barbecue in the Summer. The money goes
 to{The Friends of Wingfield School}to 
 buy equipment for the school. This    
 year we raised Â£250 . About 130 adults
 and 75 children came. The barbecue had
 coloured lights, a jazz band and a    
 marquee. Tickets cost Â£2 for adults   
 and Â£1 for children. The parents had  
 chicken and salad but we had          
 hamburgers and salad and as much free 
 squash as we wanted. The parents had  
 beer and wine. Last year  it was very 
 hot but this year it was cold . It    
 rained in the afternoon and some of   
 the tent fell down. We all went out to
 help Mr. Pratt put it up again. It was
 skill digging in the sand pit and     
 running down the ditch playing ghosts 
 in the dark while the ladies and men  
 danced. One dad helped by making a    
 special Hungarian sauce.              </content>
