		<title>18YOUNG PEOPLE DURING 20TH C</title>
		<content>Several old people in Ixworth Court Old
People's home were asked how their     
childhood differed from the children of
1985. The main difference noted was the
simplicity of a child's life at the    
beginning of this century compared with
today. Children used to be expected to 
work for the family-feeding hens,stone 
picking,gleaning,collecting wood for   
the fire,cleaning boots and looking    
after younger siblings. Today children 
are asked to do less around the home.  
They have different expectations. They 
attend clubs for sport, Youth          
organisations such as scouts,guides,   
army cadets or a youth club, they have 
hobbies and watch a lot of television. 
The old people used to only visit      
Bury St.Edmunds about twice a year by  
horse and cart(After harvest and at    
Christmas for market), now children go 
by bus or car at least weekly.         </content>
