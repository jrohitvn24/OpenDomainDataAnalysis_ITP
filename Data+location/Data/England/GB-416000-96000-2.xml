		<title>02Homes in Bransgore</title>
		<content>    The{cottages}in Bransgore are      
 mostly thatched but quite a few are   
 tiled. They have diamond-paned windows
 and old fashioned front doors. The    
 cottages usually have large gardens.  
    The{modern estate houses}have small
 gardens but the houses make up for    
 this by being modern inside eg. with  
 en-suite shower rooms and modern      
 kitchens.                             
   {Semi-detached houses}are found     
 either on small estates or on council 
 estates. These houses are usually     
 small with small gardens. They are not
 usually as nice as the modern detached
 houses.                               
    The only block of{flats}in         
 Bransgore is Bransgore House which was
 a mansion, converted into flats in    
 1960.                                 
    The{Bungalows}are ideal for the    
 elderly as they have no stairs.       </content>
