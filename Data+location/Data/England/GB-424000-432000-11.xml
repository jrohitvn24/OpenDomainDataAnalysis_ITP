		<title>11VICTORIAN CLASSROOM,LEEDS</title>
		<content> The classroom, situated in a converted
 mill,is equipped with  old furnishings
 from local schools. For our morning's 
 visit, we exchanged maroon school     
 uniform for plain, dark clothes,      
 protected by white smocks.            
 Boys wore{Victorian-style clothes}too.
 We looked like Victorian pupils with  
 our long hair neatly plaited.         
 The day began with an{assembly.}A boy 
 collected the pennies which Victorian 
 pupils would have paid. Our{lessons}  
 were those that were taught in those  
 days. We each had an old name to use  
 for the day. We wrote on slates and   
 with pen and ink. We did exercises    
 with dumb bells, not like our P.E. The
{teacher}seemed much stricter; she had 
 a cane which she threatened to use. It
 was interesting to be a Victorian     
 pupil for the morning but we prefer   
 1985. { Claire and Miranda,age 11 yrs </content>
