		<content> We go to school every day apart from  
 Saturday and Sunday. You leave school 
 when you're 16 or 18. We go home at   
 3.30p.m. and have lunch at school     
 costing Â£3.15 per week. St.Catherine's
 School, our school, was originally    
 built as a Secondary School before    
 becoming a First and Middle School in 
 1966. On another site in the village  
 was Blechingley Free School founded by
 John Whatman. Streete Court School    
 near Godstone was called Rooks Nest.  
 Now a public school; but from 1534    
 until 1964, it has been lived in by   
 many families including the Boones and
 Turners. It is situated in 140 acres.
