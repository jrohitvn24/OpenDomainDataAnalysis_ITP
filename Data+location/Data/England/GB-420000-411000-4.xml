		<content> We are from the Special School. The   
 headteacher is Miss Simpson. There are
 53 children, 6 teachers and 6 helpers 
 in our school. We have 4 classes, a   
 Special Care Unit and a Nursery. We   
 do lots of things like numbers,       
 reading, writing, computer and        
 drawing. We also go horse-riding,     
 swimming, hiking, camping, go on      
 trips such as barge holiday and to the
 seaside. Many children visit other    
 schools such as D.A.B.T.A.C. Shelley  
 High School and Kirkburton Middle     
 School.We call this link work. We have
 a garden and the leavers class grow   
 vegetables and flowers. We have a     
 youth club, here we play games such as
 snooker, there is a disco and we have 
 pop and crisps. Turnshaws School is a 
 very happy and friendly place, with   
 nice teachers and helpers.
