		<title>12*THE ABBATOIR,A BUSINESS.*</title>
		<content> At lunchtime on June 13th we went to  
 the abattoir to talk to the boss Mr   
 McMurchie.We found that he has traded 
 in Haswell for 15 years.He has        
 extended his premises and built a     
 butchers shop.It was owned by the     
 Coop.His premises are bothered by     
 vandals.There were two attempted      
 burglaries this year. His supplies    
 come from Northumbria, Alnwick and    
 Stockton marts.He supplies 48 retail  
 outlets with meat.The largest belongs 
 to Colin Lawson in Ushaw Moor. The    
 smallest is Mr Gott's in Thornley.He  
 has 150 regular customers buying for  
 the home freezer every week, but most 
 meat goes to retailers.People come    
 from all over north east England.Mr   
 McMurchie says that this is because he
 keeps old fashioned methods of quality
 butchering.Nearly all of his staff    
 travel from other villages.           </content>
