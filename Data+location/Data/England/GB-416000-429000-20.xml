		<content> Within our 'block' there are numerous 
 high technology firms,e.g.{Microvitec 
 who make computer display screens, no 
 doubt they made the one you are now   
 using. If you have flown on a 747     
 Jumbo Jet the turbine blades in the   
 engines were designed in Bradford at  
{Lucas Aerospace.}These are two        
 examples of very large firms, there   
 are also a few hundred other small    
 high technology firms.
