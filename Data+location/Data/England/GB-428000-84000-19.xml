		<title>19THE LIFEBOAT IN THE W WIGHT</title>
		<content>  We have a lifeboat service in West   
 Wight. It is a fairly new boat.The    
 journeys take 3-4 hours. They use     
 flares for signals.The crew enjoy all 
 the journeys,which sometimes are      
 frightening. The lifeboat costs about 
 Â£0.4M.Every time they go in the life- 
 boat they need lifejackets since it is
 just as easy for them to fall into the
 water as it is for us.If a wave hits  
 the lifejacket it will not leave you  
 due to 2 straps.If anyone falls into  
 the water without special clothing    
 they can't expect to last more than   
 25mins.The lifeboat has been here for 
 7 years weighing 32 tons and is 35ft  
 tall and 52ft long.It takes a 7 man   
 crew.The lifeboat saves many lives    
 every year,the highest amount in the  
 W.Wight in a day is 5.Once they saved 
 a girl and they used up 150 flares.
