		<content> Farmers in 1985 do not have a very    
 good public image. They are generally 
 blamed for the loss of hedges and the 
 replacement of a patchwork field      
 system by dreary monoculture over     
 thousands of acres. Small farmers in  
 this area recognise this image but are
 not a part of it. They do care for the
 conservation of the land, and do      
 tolerate the deprivations of wildlife 
 to a certain extent. This area is     
 fortunate in not having that class of 
 'agri-businessman' that cares nothing 
 for the countryside, and despoils it  
 for profit.                           
 Most farmers we spoke to seemed       
 moderately content with their lot.    
 They realised that their land was     
 worth a great deal of money if sold,  
 but did not know what they would do   
 without it.
