 residential outskirts of the{City of  
{BATH.}It is mainly{farmland,}most of  
 which belongs to the{Duchy of         
{Cornwall.}Most of the small town of{  
{Saltford}is included in the area,     
 being one of the link towns between { 
{Bath and Bristol}on the{A4}road.      
{Corston and Kelston}villages are      
 picturesque dormitory residential     
 areas, but they have retained the old 
 village feel about them once you are  
 off the main roadways.                
 It is a good area for{country walks.} 
 The landscape is interesting with     
{hills}in all directions and plenty of

 pride in the appearance of their
