 Chalford is in the Cotswolds,not      
 far from the town of Stroud.The area  
 is on two hillsides.Through the valley
 between runs the River Frome,the main 
 London Road,the remains of the Thames 
 and Severn Canal and the London to    
 Cheltenham Rail line.It is a beautiful
 area,the valley leading to Stroud is  
 known as the Golden Valley.Ancient    
 Cotswold stone houses cling to the    
 steep hillsides.The area consists of  
 four villages Oakridge, Bussage,      
 Chalford and France Lynch; separated  
 by woodland and farmland.It is a rural
 area with very little industry,apart  
 from a few factories on an industrial 
 estate beside the old canal.Most      
 people travel outside the area to     
 work.Chalford is a quiet and beautiful
 place to live in during the 1980's.
