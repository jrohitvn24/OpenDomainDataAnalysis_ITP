		<title>09Housing in Rathmell.</title>
		<content>    The southeastern corner of the     
 block includes the edge of Rathmell   
 village and there are several{detached
{cottages}on the road to Wham. Some are
{very modern}and new properties are    
 being built all the time.             
    Apart from this, the dwellings in  
 the block are{farm houses, mostly of  
{stone,}some dating from the           
 seventeenth century.                  
    Some of the farms have been split  
 up and sold and the buildings are now 
{residences for non-farming people,    
 either as permanent or as{holiday     
{homes.}There has been a vogue to buy  
 old properties, especially{barns,}and 
{convert}them into{highly desirable    
{country dwellings.}There are one or   
 two examples of this in the area.
