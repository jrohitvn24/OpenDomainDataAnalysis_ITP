		<title>14SPONSORED WALK IN HOUNSLOW</title>
		<content> The children of Grove Road School     
 decided to have a sponsored walk to   
 raise{money}for a{new computer.}We    
 needed{Â£900}for a BBC"B", monitor,    
 stand, printer and Edword. All the    
 children got as many sponsors as      
 possible, and on{7th May 1985}we all  
 walked around Orchard field. The      
{infants}had to do{10 laps,}and the    
{juniors}did{20.}The teachers just sat 
 around the field in chairs and ticked 
 our cards, and Mrs Broadley served    
 refreshments, as it was a very hot    
 day. We raised just over{Â£1,100}in the
 end, and we have ordered the new      
 equipment. When it is delivered we are
 going to invite the local press, and  
 they are all going to write a report  
 about our computer.This event was also
 reported in the{Grove Road Gazette,   
 edited by some of our fourth years.
