		<content> Robinsons End Middle School held a Fun
 Day on the 22nd June 1985.It was a wet
 day,but the stalls were still good.One
 stall was "Beat The Goalie" where you 
 had to dribble a football round two   
 cones and then you had to try to score
 past the goalkeeper.It cost 10 pence  
 for 5 footballs,and you had two       
 minutes to try to score with all five.
 At the darts stall you paid 10 pence  
 for 3 darts,and you had to throw the  
 darts into a "joker" from a pack of   
 cards.There was a welly wanging stall 
 where you had to throw a welly as far 
 as you could!The furthest throw won a 
 prize.The main raffle was the Grand   
 Prize Draw with several prizes such as
 an infra-red cooker and a carriage    
 clock.The main prize was a trip for   
 two to Boulogne in France.Another     
 raffle was for an autographed football
 signed by Coventry City football team.</content>
