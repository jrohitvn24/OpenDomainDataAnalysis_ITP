		<title>16A View of Ponsanooth.</title>
		<content> Ponsanooth (PONSNOWETH) is Cornish for
 New Bridge. It is set in a pleasant   
 wooded valley. E.Thomas are expanding 
 the village by helping to build a new 
 estate. In the village the housing is 
 mainly made up of two stone built     
 terraces which are up to a hundred    
 years old. Like Stithians the village 
 is surrounded by farms and small      
 holdings. The main Redruth to Falmouth
 road runs through the middle of the   
 village which is very busy during the 
 summer time when the county is        
 infested with tourists. There is a    
 Post office and general stores        
 combined, a hair dresser, a vet's     
 surgery, a paint shop and a small     
 garden centre. There is a popular     
 pub,a garage, a church and a chapel.  
 There is a squash club just outside   
 and youth club which is also for      
 people from Mabe.(Pop. 1030 in 1979)  </content>
