		<title>03LIFE IN WILLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> No new housing &amp; continued emphasis on
 farming has meant a slow change in{   
{LIFE STYLE.}Three farms out of four   
 are still working. Once all dairy now 
 Manor Farm is dairy only, Bay House   
 Farm dairy &amp; beef to fatten &amp; Watling 
 Farm (with Elm Farm) arable &amp; beef.   
 No village school means children over 
 5 being taken to Lutterworth &amp; a very 
 small group of contempories with whom 
 to play.Childern must be taken to a   
 larger centre for all Youth activities
 There are 2 children under 5,3 between
 5 &amp; 12 years &amp; 4 over 12.             
 Community sociallife comes from money 
 raising projects needed to maintain   
 the Hall &amp; Church (whist drives,sherry
 evenings etc).Each year a village fete
 is  held supported from both in &amp; out-
 side the village community.Villagers  
 enjoy their closeknit &amp; caring life   
 style.                                </content>
