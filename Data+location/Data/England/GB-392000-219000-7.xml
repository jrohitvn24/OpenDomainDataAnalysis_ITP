		<title>07AN OLD HOUSE IN CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> Treaford Cottage was built in the     
 nineteenth century.It was used as a   
 coaching house.The upstairs was for   
 people to rest in after a coach       
 journey, or maybe spend the night.Down
 stairs was used for the horses.There  
 were two stables and two places to    
 keep the coaches.Over the years       
 Treaford Cottage was neglected,and    
 became a tip.Then my family moved     
 in.The place was said to be beyond    
 repair,but my family got cracking and 
 made the house livable again.It has   
 seven rooms,two of which are very     
 big.Outside there is a nice garden    
 with a vegetable patch.We keep two    
 rabbits in hutches but they often come
 indoors.
