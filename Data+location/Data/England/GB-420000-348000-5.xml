		<content> Children in our study block attend    
 different schools according to where  
 they live.There are three main        
 villages.                             
 Kniveton is the only village with a   
 primary school still operating,the    
 others having lost theirs in previous 
 years.Children in the Kniveton area   
 attend Kniveton School until they are 
 eleven years old and then they        
 transfer to Queen Elizabeth's Grammar 
 School in Ashbourne.                  
 Children from Hognaston and Atlow are 
 taken to Hulland Ward Primary School, 
 a large village to the south,and from 
 there they transfer to Queen          
 Elizabeth's Grammar School or some go 
 to the Anthony Gell School in         
 Wirksworth.
