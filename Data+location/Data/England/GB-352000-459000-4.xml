It takes Mr.Longton two or three years 
to train a puppy up to a good standard 
but the time depends on the dog.You    
have to be very patient and firm.It is 
important to choose one you really like
as you will spend many hours with it.  
      Mr.Longton's father won the      
English National many years ago,his    
son has won several trials including   
the Windermere Trial and his grandson  
Brian Dodd is keeping up the tradition.
He was chosen to represent England in  
the junior section of the One man and  
his dog series,on BBC TV.              
      At the moment Mr. Longton has    
about 50 cups and trophies in his front
room and his wife is kept very busy    
polishing them.
