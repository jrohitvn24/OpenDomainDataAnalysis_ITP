		<content> The church,built of locally quarried  
 stone, has a raised and circular      
 churchyard which may indicate that it 
 was a pre-christian site of worship.It
 is built in the Transitional period   
 between Decorated and Perpendicular   
 and has a ring of 6 bells.            
 The fine quality of the organ is much 
 prized today and recently the church  
 has seen a number of concerts and     
 organ recitals e.g. by the            
 Bedfordshire Association of Organists 
 and the Luton Police Choir.The organ  
 was originally a barrel organ from St,
 Mary's Church, Bedford,was completely 
 rebuilt on a gallery and              
 electrified.All pipework from the     
 former organ that had been            
 voiced and regulated by the Rev.      
 Bonavin-Hunt (a tonal expert) was     
 used.
