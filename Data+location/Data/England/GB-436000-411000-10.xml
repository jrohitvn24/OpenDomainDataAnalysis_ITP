		<title>10A Farmers Day.</title>
		<content>   Mr and Mrs Jenkinson rise about 7am 
 in time for breakfast at 7.30am.After 
 breakfast Mr Jenkinson checks the     
 live-stock(which at present consists  
 of 31 heifers,7 bullocks,12 ewes and 5
 lambs)to make sure that none have     
 strayed from the fields,during the    
 night.  When the dew has gone, about  
 9.15am, he turns his attention to hay_
 making.It will take him all day to cut
 a 10 acre field of hay but he always  
 breaks for dinner at 12.00.  When the 
 hay has been cut, the farmer has his  
 own baler to do small bales but hires 
 a contractor to do the large rolls of 
 hay.  The hay is then stored in the   
 barn.                                 
   Mr Jenkinson's busy day ends between
 5 or 6.O'clock when he will return to 
 the farmhouse for his evening meal.At 
 about 7.00 he goes and checks on the  
 live-stock again.                     </content>
