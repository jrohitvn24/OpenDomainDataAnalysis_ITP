		<content> In the main street is the village shop
 and Post Office. The shop stocks a    
 variety of foodstuffs, vegetables,    
 fruit and bread. The Post Office is   
 used for purchasing stamps and postal 
 orders, the Giro Bank, Savings Bank   
 and payment of pensions and           
 allowances. There is a postal service 
 on weekdays. Mobile shops visit the   
 village. These include 2 butchers, 1  
 grocer, 2 fresh fish merchants, and   
 ready cooked fish and chips. A window 
 cleaner visits monthly, milk and      
 papers are delivered daily and coal-  
 merchants also make deliveries.       
  Many people travel to surrounding    
 villages and towns to shop at super-  
 markets which have greater choice and 
 lower prices. Clothing, electrical    
 goods and furniture are also bought   
 outside the village. Mail order firms,
 often run by local agents are popular.</content>
