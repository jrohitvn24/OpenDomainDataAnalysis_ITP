 My favourite{indoor game}is{tennis.   
{Tennis}has a racket.A racket is a     
 piece of wood with nylon in it.There  
 are two people.You have to bat the    
 ball over a net and other person bats 
 it back.                              
 An{outdoor game}I like is{Ghostbusters
 It is a game with four people on each 
 side.There are four ghosts and four   
 ghostbusters.The ghostbusters chase   
 the ghosts.When the ghosts get caught 
 other ghosts can tig them out of the  
 ghostbusters den.It is a very good    
 game.In{Off Ground Tig}one person is  
 on.When you jump on a bin or something
 it's a den.                           
 In{Hide and Seek}someone goes and     
 hides and someone else goes and tries 
 to find them.The first person to get  
 caught is on.                         </content>
