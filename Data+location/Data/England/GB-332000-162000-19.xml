 My name is Michelle.                  
 On Tuesday 2nd July I woke up and my  
 Dad had gone to work and my Mum was   
 cooking the breakfast and my brother  
 was still asleep.I got dressed and    
 went down stairs. Mum said:"You've    
 got up late again." I had my          
 breakfast and got my school stuff     
 ready and went to school.By then my   
 brother had woken up so my Mum got him
 up.He was in one of his good moods    
 which was a relief.At 11:00a.m. my Mum
 put Jake, which is my brother's name  
 to bed.Now my Mum had peace and       
 quiet.Mum did all the house work while
 Jake was in bed.This was the washing  
 up,hoovering, tidying up,cleaning the 
 bathroom and digging the garden.My Mum
 heard a cry.It was Jake.So she went up
 stairs and got him up.
