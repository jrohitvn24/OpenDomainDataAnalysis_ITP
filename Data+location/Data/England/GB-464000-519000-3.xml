		<title>03CHANGING FACE OF SALTBURN.</title>
		<content> Saltburn today is a small community   
 town whose population has grown       
 slowly over the years. Once it was a  
 popular spa town and tourist resort   
 but now caters for day visitors from  
 nearby towns and villages. Bathing    
 machines, pierrots, brass bands and a 
 theatre were popular in the early     
 1900's. Sadly they no longer exist    
 giving way to amusement arcades.      
 Within the town everybody knew each   
 other and policemen were familiar     
 figures walking the beat. Saltburn was
 part of the countryside with its      
 Victorian housing overlooking open    
 fields. People would travel by horse  
 drawn cart or cycle. The shops, with  
 food supplied by local farmers, met   
 the needs of the town. Today people   
 pass through Saltburn on the coast    
 road to places such as Whitby, Redcar 
 and Scarborough.(J.Croker,F.Roughton) </content>
