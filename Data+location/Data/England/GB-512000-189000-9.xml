		<title>09NEW HOUSES, HARROW.</title>
		<content>  Since the beginning of 1984, new     
 houses have been built in Evelyn Drive
 which is in{Hatch End.}Each house     
 costs between Â£130,000 and Â£150,000   
 which is quite expensive.             
  The area is particularly suitable for
 families because there is a golf      
 course, park and school nearby. There 
 is also a cub scout pack as well as   
 rugby and cricket clubs.              
  These detached houses have 4 bed     
 rooms, 1 bathroom and 2 toilets. The  
 gardens are of an average size. Some  
 of the houses boast 2 garages and     
 fitted kitchens and are like a mini   
 mansion.                              
  A{Neighbourhood Watch Scheme,}to help
 to prevent crime, operates in some    
 areas of Hatch End.  If anyone sees   
 something suspicious, they phone a    
 co-ordinator who phones for help.     
 Today, 45 roads are in the scheme.    </content>
