 Most schools in 1985 have mixed pupils
 some have only one sex in schools.    
 There is the nursery for when you're  
 just a toddler. There is the Primary  
 middle and high schools. School starts
 and finishes at 9.00am till 3.00pm. In
 your Primary they teach you to read   
 and write and add up etc.             
     You learn these's things so you   
 can go for a job.                     
     Whilst in school you have two     
 breaks, one for 20 minutes in the     
 middle of the morning and one is for  
 your dinner hour.                     
     If you do a certain subject they  
 have trips away for these lessons.    
     Some schools have sport days      
 between house teams at the end term.  
 They give trophy's to the winning     
 house's.                              </content>
