 _______                               
 In Walpole it is mostly ARABLE farming
 e.g. potatoes,sugar beet and corn.    
 There are some fruit farms and in     
 summer and at potato time we have     
 diddicois who bring their caravans    
 down for the picking seasons.The main 
 fruits are strawberries and apples.The
 farms are not large.Many farmers will 
 have 100 acres or less of their own   
 land.                                 
 PARISH COUNCILS                       
 _______________                       
 There are 3 village centres at Walpole
 St. Peter,Walpole St. Andrew and      
 Walpole Marsh.These belong to two     
 parish councils but very soon they    
 will amalgamete.The parish councils   
 meet four times a year in the schools.
