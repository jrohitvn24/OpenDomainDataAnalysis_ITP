 There have been {allotments}at least  
 since 1925. Since 1965 the Parish has 
 bought a{playing field}and received a 
 gift of land for a small children's { 
{playground}.David Yeandle,aged 11,    
 writes:"There is a playing field      
 called{Jack's Acre}named after my     
 Grandad, Edward John Yeandle/but Jack 
 was his nickname.He opened it in 1980"
 The school play football and hold     
 Sports Day here.  In the 1970s the    
 parents provided a small open-air     
{swimming bath}grant-aided by the      
 Education Authority. Of the two       
 established public houses one has a   
 skittle-alley.  The{Parish Hall},     
 built on land given by the then Rector
 in the 1930s, is in constant use.
