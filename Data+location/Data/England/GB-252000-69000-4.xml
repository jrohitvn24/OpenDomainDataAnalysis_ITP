		<content>  The farm{buildings}are generally in a
 good state of repair and are used as  
 grain and hay stores and as shelter   
 for farm equipment.There were no      
 obviously ancient barns.Most barns    
 were of steel girder construction.    
  The{Forestry}Commission is engaged   
 in the plantation of timber resources 
 especially in the south of the area   
 and on the shores of Burrator         
 Reservoir.Active work on timber       
 production was in progress.           
  The farms in the area appeared to    
 have no{financial}problem in terms of 
 maintenance except for one farm in the
 Eggworthy area. This small farm was   
 forced to the expedient of using old  
 corrugated iron sheeting for its      
 fencing in places. No facilities here 
 for bulk storage. Several small sheds 
 in great need of repair - some        
 obsolete farm machinery.              </content>
