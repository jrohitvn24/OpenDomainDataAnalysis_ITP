		<title>16CHANGES IN PADBURY LIFE</title>
		<content> There have been many changes within   
 the villages in the last 20 years. To 
 some they spell progress, to others a 
 much valued way of life has gone for  
 ever. In Hillesden the school has     
 gone,the heart of the village removed.
 Much of the farm land is in the hands 
 of a business consortium, however good
 they are to the village they bring in 
 farm managers from outside. In Padbury
 the railway station, the village shop 
 and the bakery have all gone. Worse   
 still,in the eyes of families who have
 lived there for generations,in        
 both villages, there has been an      
 influx of 'outsiders'. It is difficult
 for some villagers to accept them,    
 especially those who only come at     
 weekends or those who do not wish to  
 take any part in village life. Those  
 who are prepared to join in are made  
 to feel at home.                      </content>
