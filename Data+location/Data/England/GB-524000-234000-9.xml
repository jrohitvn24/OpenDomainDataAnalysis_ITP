		<content>{ Public}transport within the block is 
 very poor, the only service being a   
 few buses a day through Bygrave and   
 Newnham (just off the N. of the block)
 from Baldock on the way to Royston.   
                                       
  The King's Cross-Cambridge railway   
 line runs through the block and       
 Baldock station caters for commuters  
 in both directions.  There is a strong
 pull towards the larger centres of    
 Letchworth, Hitchin and Stevenage     
 which are less than 5 miles to the    
 West and South of Baldock.            
                                       
  Most movements within and through the
 block are by{private}transport.  It   
 would be very difficult to survive    
 socially and economically without a   
 car in any house or farm greater than 
 2 or 3 km. from Baldock.
