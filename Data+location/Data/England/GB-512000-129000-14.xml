		<title>14FARMING NEAR HORSHAM</title>
		<content>   Farming is different to the south   
 west of Horsham at Tower Hill as the  
 soil is{Wealden clay.}This is         
 non-porous so it is not good for      
 growing crops as it gets water-logged.
   Near Parthings on Tower Hill there  
 is a layer of{Horsham stone.}This     
 Horsham stone has been{quarried}in    
 places in the past, and some craters  
 and quarries are still visible even   
 though many have been filled in.      
 Because of the porous quality of this 
 stone, many{springs of water}trapped  
 between the clay and stone make their 
 way out.One of these springs was used 
 for the cattle trough in Parthings    
 farmyard.The spring still runs but    
 does not supply drinking water for the
 cows any longer; it just runs into a  
 little ditch and into the cattleyard  
 where it can often overflow when there
 is heavy rain.                        </content>
