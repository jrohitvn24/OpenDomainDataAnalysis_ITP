    St.Laurence church is very old,    
 probably 1000 years old.It shows signs
 of a priests door dating from the 13th
 century.The roof is supported by      
 trestles on solid oak beams made of   
 tree trunks carved into shape.The     
 walls are mostly flint and brick with 
 stone supports.All the windows are of 
 different ages.St.Laurence is one of  
 the few churches to have a chimney.   
    Quite recently in February 1985    
 deathwatch beetle was found to have   
 attacked the woodwork under the pews  
 at the back of the church.The church  
 is still well used today for Sunday   
 worship and ceremonies such as        
 Baptism,weddings,funerals and other   
 festivals.
