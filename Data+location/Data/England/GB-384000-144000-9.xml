		<content> Village children returning home from  
 the town school, pensioners on a day  
 trip to the sea, housewives collecting
 the weekly shopping - almost everyone 
 in Warminster has at some time used   
 the services of "Beeline", a local    
 company that runs a fleet of coaches  
 and a taxi business as well. Mr Roy   
 Hayball, the Managing Director of     
 "Beeline", moved from Yeovil to start 
 the company in 1969. Based at his     
 Boreham Road depot, he has gradually  
 built up his coach business including 
 contracts for school buses. In 1985 he
 employs 10 full-time staff with a     
 fleet of 10 coaches. A typical coach  
 costs about Â£50,000 but the most      
 valuable coach owned by the company is
 worth Â£60,000. Mr Hayball has a strong
 interest in Road Safety and believes  
 that coaches are the safest vehicles  
 on the road.                          </content>
