		<content>  There are more shops in Market       
 Deeping than Deeping St. James.       
 This is probably because there is a   
 modern purpose-built shopping centre  
 in Market Deeping which includes a    
 large supermarket.As a result of this 
 some of the smaller village shops in  
 Deeping St. James have had to close   
 down.Apart from building societies and
 banks the most popular shops are      
 hair-dressers, clothes shops and      
 newsagents.The new precinct, built in 
 1985, gives more variety to the shops 
 in Market Deeping.Shops such as a     
 florist's,cleaner's,baker's,cobbler's 
 and a craft shop can be found in the  
 precinct.In Deeping St.James there    
 are two rows of shops.The one by the  
 Primary School is a row of six shops  
 and the other row of five shops is in 
 Rycroft Avenue.
