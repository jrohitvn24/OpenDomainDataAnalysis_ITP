		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content> This area is almost entirely South    
 Downs,with a steep slope at the       
 northern edge of the squares and a    
 gradual slope down towards the        
 southern edge.The highest point is    
 over 235 metres high.The area is      
 mainly Downland but it is criss-      
 crossed with bridle ways and          
 footpaths.                            
 The largest settlement is Pyecombe    
 with fewer than 50 houses.            
 There are many scattered farms        
 producing mainly grain crops.         
 The main railway links London with    
 Brighton as does the A23 road which   
 runs east and south through the       
 squares.Heavy traffic commuters use   
 this stretch of road.The Downs is also
 used recreationally with activities   
 such as walking,horse-riding and golf.
 Picnics,kite-flying and in winter     
 sledging are popular.                 </content>
