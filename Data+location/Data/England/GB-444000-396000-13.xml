		<title>13RAWMARSH AND PARKGATE</title>
		<content>   I shall try to describe{Rawmarsh}for
 those people who are not lucky enough 
 to live here.  As you come into       
{Rawmarsh}down at{Parkgate,}it is quite
 a derelict place.  There is a disused 
 steelworks and it is mostly wasteland.
 A little further up are the shops.    
 These sell mostly antique furniture,  
 though there are video shops, a hair- 
 dressers, a bakery, newsagents, a     
 library, a petrol station and a dental
 surgery close by.  On the top of      
{Rawmarsh Hill}is{St. Mary's Church}and
 across from it stands the rectory.    
 Most of the houses are semi-detached  
 and terraced.  The schools in Rawmarsh
 are St. Joseph's, St. Mary's, Ashwood,
 Monkwood, Thorogate, Rosehill and     
 Sandhill.  There is also a large comp-
 rehensive school.  Rawmarsh has a swim
 ming pool which we visit on a Tuesday.
