		<content>    All 4 farms use tractors to pull   
ploughs,cultivators,fertilisers,sprays,
drills etc. and all except Church Farm 
have their own combine harvesters.The  
newer tractors have 4-wheel drive and  
reversible ploughs now make ploughing  
quicker.In the yard of Church Farm is a
newly renovated 1864 Ransome Newcastle 
Prize Plough,a light land,horse-drawn  
plough which was used here until 1950  
and cost 4 pounds 5 shillings when new.
    Naturally the large farm group owns
the most up to date machines including 
2 industrial shovels, a low ground     
pressure vehicle for winter use,a      
forage harvester,a direct seed drill,  
automatic cluster removers for milking 
and their second combine harvester is  
of a revolutionary design only 3 years 
old,called an Axial Flow Harvester.    
    As well as traditional barley and  
wheat,crops now include rape &amp; linseed.</content>
