		<content>Sywell is predominately a farming area 
although it accounts for very few      
jobs. There are six farms in our block.
Most farmers grow wheat, barley, rape, 
potatoes and hay, and keep cows and    
sheep. The crops are the most          
important. The farmers rotate their    
crops: first they grow potatoes, then  
wheat, then barley and lastly rape     
before going back to potatoes.         
Soft-fruit farms are also in the       
vicinity, though just outside our      
block, which specialise in "Pick your  
own".                                  
The farmers own their own machinery.   
They help each other at harvest time   
and when they set and spray the crops. 
Special people help at sheep shearing  
time. Casual labour is taken on to help
at potato harvesting. There are no     
orchards.
