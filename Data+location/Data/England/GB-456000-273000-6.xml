		<title>06  TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>                                       
  We did a survey on the M1, which is a
very busy motorway, the A5, which is a 
Roman Road called Watling Street and   
Crick Rd., which links two villages.   
  We found that the M1 was busier than 
either of the other two roads, as      
expected. We were surprised to find    
that there were more motorbikes on the 
A5 than on the M1. We were also        
surprised to find that there were no   
coaches on the A5.                     
  We surveyed the M1 on June 11th at 10
am. The other two roads were both      
surveyed on the same day during the    
afternoon. We carried out the survey   
for 15 minutes on each road.
