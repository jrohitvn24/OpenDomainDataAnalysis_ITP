		<content>Maidstone follows the general urban    
pattern. At the corner of Union St. are
modern flats where nineteenth century  
terraced housing used to be.  Much of  
this still remains, though some has    
been modernized and pedestranized in   
the last ten years.  Further out are   
small private estates and council semi-
detatched dwellings with small gardens;
e.g. Park Avenue. Beyond this are      
private estates built in the late 60's 
to accommmodate overspill from the     
town; e.g. Vinters Park. There are     
larger houses along Sittingbourne Rd.  
of all ages with various functions,    
including colleges and vets. In        
surrounding villages, housing is mainly
semi-detatched estates with some       
historical buildings depending on age. 
Individual farm houses are scattered   
across the countryside.
