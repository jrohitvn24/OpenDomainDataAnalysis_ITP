		<content>   The three villages of Eaton Bray,   
 Edlesborough and Totternhoe lie at the
 foot of the Dunstable Downs (famous   
 for its gliding and Whipsnade Zoo),   
 some 36 miles north of London, and    
 where the flat and fertile Vale of    
 Aylesbury, meets the northern         
 outreaches of the Chiltern Hills, on  
 the borders of Beds and Bucks.        
   Separated from the industry and     
 commerce of nearby Dunstable and Luton
 by Chalk hills rising to over 800 feet
 above sea level, the villages have a  
 pleasant, and largely unspoilt, rural 
 atmosphere with outstanding views in  
 almost every direction.               
   This, coupled with its proximity to 
 the M1 and to two major railway lines 
 at Leighton Buzzard and Luton, has    
 made it a very attractive residential 
 location for the more affluent        
 commuter and local business executive.</content>
