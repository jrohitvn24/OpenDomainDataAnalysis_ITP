		<title>07POLICING THE AREA</title>
		<content> The area is served by a small police  
 station situated on Main Street,East  
 Leake.It is only open at certain times
 of the week and may close in the      
 future.When the station is not        
 manned,calls have to be made to West  
 Bridgford,some ten miles away.        
 The local police report that there is 
 little crime in the area,the main     
 problem being the large number of     
 teenagers,living mainly in East Leake.
 The police work on a shift system,each
 shift lasting five hours.             
 Great efforts have been made to build 
 good relationships between the police 
 and the community.This is particularly
 so in the case of children.Regular    
 visits are made to schools at which   
 the subjects of the danger of going   
 with strangers,the work of the police 
 etc.are discussed.
