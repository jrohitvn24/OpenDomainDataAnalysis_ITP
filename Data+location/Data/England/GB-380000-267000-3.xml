		<title>03Recent Changes in this area</title>

 In the area of{Lincomb}several changes
 have taken place during recent years. 
 For a start pheasants used to be kept 
 in the woods to be shot as game but   
 this proved uneconomical because of   
 poachers,so they stopped doing it. The
 farmers around the Lincomb area used  
 to keep dairy cows but in the last    
 decade they decided to change to meat 
 cows for finacial reasons,so the      
 daires of Lincomb lie disused.On parts
 of the farmland of Lincomb private    
 houses have been built.These houses   
 are bought by people with quite a bit 
 of money,the houses here are probably 
 more exspensive because of the pretty 
 area.People living here normally work 
 quite a distance away,therefore giving
 little to the community.
