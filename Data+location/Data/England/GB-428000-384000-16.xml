		<title>16A Survey of our Class&lt;contd></title>
		<content> e person had four.  Out of thirty     
 people, fourteen had one car, ten had 
 two cars, and one had four cars. Five 
 children in our class had no car at   
 all.                                  
      We also surveyed the jobs which  
 our fathers and mothers do.  We found 
 that 68% of our fathers were in a     
 profession, whilst the rest were in   
 wage earning jobs.  There was no      
 unemployment amongst our fathers at   
 all.                                  
      The job patterns of our mothers  
 was a complete reversal of this trend.
 34% were in a profession, whilst the  
 remainder were in jobs.  For the      
 purpose of this survey we counted     
 being a housewife as a job rather than
 a profession.  One mum said it was    
 more of a vocation than anything else!
