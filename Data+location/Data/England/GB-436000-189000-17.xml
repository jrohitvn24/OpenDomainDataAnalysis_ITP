		<content> Denchworth has 10 families with       
 children under 16. There are about 13 
 children and 120 adults. The average  
 age is 50. On Thursdays, the old      
 people have a Whist Drive. There is   
 little else for the people to do in   
 their spare time in the village       
 itself. There is very little          
 employment available in the village.  
 Jobs are in Oxford, Abingdon, Wantage,
 Swindon and Harwell. Employed people  
 are teachers, servicemen, Harwell     
 scientists, businessmen or writers.   
 Denchworth has very few facilities.   
 They have a pub, The Fox, a mobile    
 grocery van and a mobile post office  
 for stamps and pensions, an informal  
 game of cricket once a fortnight and a
 weekly church service. Sunday School  
 is once a month. Children and younger 
 adults go to Hanney and Wantage for   
 recreation and shopping.              </content>
