 In September 1984 gasmen came to lay  
 pipes under our school field.They     
 found a Saxon graveyard. The          
 archeologists came. They found{21     
{graves}but they estimated there       
 were between{60 and 100 graves}under  
 our playing field . The archeologist  
 found a{skeleton }of a man with only  
 a few bones missing. He was{1300}years
 old.He was buried facing{North-South  
 and all the others were facing        
{East-West.}We think this is because   
 our Saxon man had a different {       
{religion.
