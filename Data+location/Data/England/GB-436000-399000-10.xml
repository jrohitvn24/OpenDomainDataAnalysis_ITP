		<content> Elsecar Colliery                      
 Coal has been the major source of     
 employment and reason for the growth  
 of the village of Elsecar since the   
 1800s.The "Planting Pit" or Simon     
 Wood colliery closed in 1903 and High 
 Elsecar Pit which was part of Elsecar 
 old Colliery closed in 1888.Elsecar   
 main colliery was begun in July 1905  
 and continued producing coal until    
 1983-the last time coal was mined in  
 Elsecar.The pit head buildings of     
 Elsecar Main Colliery remained        
 standing until the winter of 1984     
 when extensive demoliton began.The    
 colliery chimney which had been the   
 landmark of Elsecar was finaly        
 demolished on Wednesday 27th February 
 1985.
