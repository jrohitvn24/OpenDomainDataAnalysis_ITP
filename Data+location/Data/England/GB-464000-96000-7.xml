		<title>07SHOPPING IN SOUTHSEA</title>
		<content>     Southsea is one of three important
 shopping areas in Portsmouth and is   
 mostly used by people who live in the 
 area. In the summer there are a lot of
 holiday visitors who shop there.      
     The shops include two department  
 stores, chain stores such as W.H.Smith
 and Boots, furniture and clothes      
 shops, and several restaurants and    
 cafes. A particular feature is the    
 great number of speciality shops such 
 as antique shops and jewellers.       
     Most of the people interviewed    
 like the shopping precinct because it 
 is peaceful without vehicles but some 
 think it is rather dirty and needs    
 more rubbish bins. Some think that    
 there should be more cafes and record 
 shops and that a branch of Marks and  
 Spencers would be useful in the       
 precinct.One manager said that trade  
 is excellent and increasing.          </content>
