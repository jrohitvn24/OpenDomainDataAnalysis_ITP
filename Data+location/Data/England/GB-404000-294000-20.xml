		<content> The people we interviewed felt that   
 the area in general needed a greater  
 police presence to control vandalism, 
 and more facilities, particularly for 
 the young and elderly. Most people    
 hoped that employment prospects would 
 improve soon, leading to greater      
 prosperity, particularly in the       
 Kingstanding area of the block.       
                                       
   Two schools co-operated on this     
 project, Kingsland Primary N.C. and   
 Maryvale R.C. Primary. The classes    
 involved were Class 2, aged 10, and   
 their teacher Miss M. Dalby, with the 
 help of Mrs R. Caro, Mrs J. Clark and 
 Mr Penman the headmaster; Class 8,    
 aged 11, and their teacher Miss S.    
 Kelly, with the help of Mrs A.        
 Hazlewood, Miss F. Kelly and Mr       
 Sherlock the headmaster.
