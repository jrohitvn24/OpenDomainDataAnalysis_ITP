 I wake up at 7.50. I get out of bed   
 and go downstairs and have breakfast.I
 have Weetabix. I get dressed, go      
 upstairs and brush my teeth.Then I    
 pack my school bag. At 8.30 my brother
 and I walk down to catch the school   
 bus. At the bus stop, which is by the 
 Post Office, we meet up with 6 people.
 In a few minutes our bus comes. On the
 way to school we travel through 5     
 villages. Our school is in Buckland   
 Newton. The 5 villages we go through  
 are Pulham, Glanvilles Wooton,        
 Middlemarsh and Holwell. Our school is
 quite small. There are only 70        
 children there and only 4 teachers.In 
 the evening on the way home we sit at 
 the back of the bus and talk about    
 different things.
