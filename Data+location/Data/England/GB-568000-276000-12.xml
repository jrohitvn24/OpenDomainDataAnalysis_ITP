		<title>12 Holywell Row  Chapel</title>
		<content> Originally the Chapel was a Quaker    
Meeting House,built in approximately   
1678 like a barn,with a thatched roof, 
and one large room downstairs and two  
rooms upstairs. In 1759 a six foot wall
was built round the graveyard to keep  
the cattle out.                        
 By 1875 the Methodists were holding   
services in the Meeting House and      
regular Sunday Schools were conducted. 
In 1897 the Meeting House was purchased
by the Wesleyan Methodist Church and   
became their own Chapel. In 1955 a new 
extension was erected.                 
 There are a number of rare organs in  
the Chapel,one of which was built in   
Bury St.Edmunds. Most of the furniture 
is made by hand in memory of certain   
members of the Chapel.                 
 There is an old picture of Quakers End
in the Chapel for safe keeping.
