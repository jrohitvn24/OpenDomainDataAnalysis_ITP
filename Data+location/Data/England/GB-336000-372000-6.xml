		<title>06Farming Day</title>
		<content> When I am  not at school I get up at  
 5 a.m. with my Dad and go and bring   
 the cows out of the field and into the
 collecting yard.Then we start milking 
 and afterwards we have to clean out   
 the parlour.The milk tanker collects  
 the milk at 8.00 p.m.At 8.30 p.m. we  
 go in for our breakfast which lasts   
 until 9.00 p.m.After breakfast we go  
 out again to roll the fields and it   
 takes about three hours per field.    
 Lunch is from midday until 1 p.m      
 and then we have to clean the bulk    
 tank and do general work around the   
 farm depending on the time of year.At 
 2.30 p.m.we collect the cows again and
 milk them.When we have cleaned out the
 parlour we carry on rolling until     
 dinner time at 6.00p.m.After dinner we
 carry on rolling until it is dark but 
 sometimes I go fishing in our ponds.  
 I go to bed about 9.30 to 10.00p.m.   </content>
