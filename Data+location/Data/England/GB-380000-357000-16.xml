		<title>16SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> The common major concern in the area  
 is that of traffic.On the A533 which  
 runs through the village the speed    
 limit is 40mph.Residents feel this    
 should be lowered to 30mph.In Scholar 
 Green there are moves to inrease the  
 speed on the A34 from 30mph to 40mph. 
 again residents are against this.     
 On the canal in Rode Heath there is a 
 redundant steel lock.Children despite 
 warnings use this as a climbing frame.
 Residents fear a fatility.There is    
 also the danger of the canal both in  
 summer and in winter when it is       
 covered with ice.                     
 There is also concern over the        
 facilities for the younger            
 generations.The youth club is         
 desperately trying to provide it's own
 building but there is much concern    
 over the siting of the building from  
 the longer established residents.     </content>
