		<title>04THE  BUILDINGS  OF  YANWORTH</title>
		<content>    {Yanworth has 2 definite parts. }To
 the east{the old church is  surrounded
{by  fine  old outbuildings  and an old
{tithe barn. }A track past four  modern
 houses built in  1960  leads west to{a
{country lane _ Yanworth's main street.
 These{stone houses}bear the date 1863.
 Apart from the extensions  to some old
 barns  little  has  changed  for  many
 years. {The  stone  farm buildings are
{fine  examples of the  Cotswold style.
     In the middle of Yanworth care has
 been taken at the  estate's  tractor /
 machine base to build a big  fuel tank
 and a workshop almost out of sight.   
     Great pride and care is taken with
 the {private garden / vegetable plots.
     With  all the land privately owned
 and  with no likelihood of speculative
 building  it  seems that{Yanworth will
{continue  to  look much the same for a
{very long time.                       </content>
