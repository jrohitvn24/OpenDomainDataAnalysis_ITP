		<content> A small development of relatively new 
 houses is known as{The Bury}and was   
 built on the site of the original     
 Pavenham Bury. This was a Victorian   
 building in the style of a Tudor      
 mansion. The owner, a Mr.Alexander was
 the major landowner in the village and
 had very strict views on alcohol. He  
 reputedly provided a coffee lounge in 
 the village to discourage his tenants 
 from using the local inns. The Bury   
 itself was demolished in the early    
 1960's.
