		<title>06SHOPPING IN WEST HULL</title>
		<content> Hessle Road provided excellent        
 shopping facilities for the people    
 of West Hull until the decline of the 
 fishing industry,the demolition of    
 houses and,more recently,the          
 parking restrictions imposed by the   
 work for the new South Orbital Road.  
  The opening of two superstores in    
 West Hull has adversely affected the  
 trade of grocery shops and small      
 supermarkets in our area although our 
 survey showed that some of the shops  
 have attracted custom back by         
 introducing longer opening hours and  
 Sunday trading.                       
  A questionaire completed by shoppers 
 revealed that many preferred to do    
 their weekly shopping "under one      
 roof"and found the garden centre and  
 D.I.Y department at one store an added
 bonus.                                
                                       </content>
