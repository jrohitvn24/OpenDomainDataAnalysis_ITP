		<content>   The village of Walton on            
 Trent,together with the neighbouring  
 village of Rosliston,was mentioned in 
 the original Domesday Book.           
   Most of the land then belonged to   
 Earl Algar and was valued at ten      
 pounds.                               
   Today,the land is very valuable not 
 only for its rich farmland but for its
 gravel deposits and potential oil     
 deposits.(An oil exploration team     
 surveyed the area in the Spring of    
 1985).Coal,too,is mined from under    
 part of the area.                     
    A large part of the land belongs to
 Catton Hall Estate and the farms are  
 let to tenant farmers.                
    At Borough Hill there are the      
 remains of an Iron Age fort and at    
 Fatholm in 1984 they found evidence of
 people living here six thousand years 
 ago.                                  </content>
