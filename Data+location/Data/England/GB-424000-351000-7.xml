		<content> Hopton Hall is the largest house in   
 the village.It was built in the 1560's
 but has been altered a great deal     
 since then.The middle portion of the  
 house was once an open courtyard now  
 closed with a flat arched roof.Built  
 mainly of brick it has always been the
 home of the Gell progeny.The early    
 Gells derived there wealth from the   
 lead mining industry.It was Sir Philip
 Gell who had the road 'Via Gellia'    
 made in 1790 to transport the coal to 
 the Cromford Canal. It is thought that
 at one time Mary Queen of Scots slept 
 in a four poster bed made for Sir John
 Gell.The Gell dynasty endowed the     
 present primary school in             
 Carsington(now church aided) and built
 almshouses in Hopton and Wirksworth.  
 All in all the family of Gell were    
 patricians in the district although   
 they are now less significant.        </content>
