		<content> There is evidence that Crouch  Farm   
 was there when Napoleon was fighting  
 at Waterloo.Today they grow some wheat
 but the farm is mainly grass.The farm 
 keeps cows and a few horses.They have 
 180 cows,80 of which are milked.There 
 is one bull and a few geese and       
 chickens.The farm is 300 acres        
 including 10 acres of deciduous       
 woodland.There are twenty fields      
 altogether.The owner of Crouch Farm is
 The Cooper Essex Trust and the tenant 
 is John Freeman.He is also the        
 Mayor of Highworth and told us that a 
 cow is worth up to Â£500.He employs    
 three people,and the farm has been in 
 the family for twenty five years.
