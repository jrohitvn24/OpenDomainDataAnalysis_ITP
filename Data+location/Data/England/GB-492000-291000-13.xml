		<content>The Manor of Deene originally belonged 
to the Abbey of Westminster...with the 
monks using the area for hunting.      
Then in 1215 Deene was leased to Sir   
Ivo de Deene, whose family continued to
live there until the late 15th century.
Other families,including the Colets &amp;  
Lyttons,held the property until it was 
acquired by Sir Robert Brudenell in    
1514.Deene Hall has remained in the    
Brudenell family to the present day.   
The villages of Deene and Deenethorpe  
have been closely associated with Deene
Estate....most of the inhabitants being
employed there.                        
The 16th century saw the building of   
Kirby Hall,but this Elizabethan house  
was not regularly lived in after the   
18th century.                          
Much of the study area was ravaged by  
quarrying in the early 20th century,but
has now been reclaimed for farming.    </content>
