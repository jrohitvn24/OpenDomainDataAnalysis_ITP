		<content>   This area is{largely residential    
 with some industry, mainly small      
 businesses but with two or three large
 engineering firms. The housing of the 
 area has been mainly built on the     
 slopes of several steep hills with the
 industry being mainly located in the  
 river valley.                         
   Houses are predominantly terraced,  
 built before the first world war,     
 although more modern houses appear on 
 two later council estates. There are  
 several tower blocks in the           
 Upperthorpe area and one huge complex 
 of council flats known as the{Kelvin  
{Flats.}There is also a large block of 
 private flats known as Regency Court  
 near to Hillsborough shopping centre. 
   Much of the remaining terraced      
 Victorian housing has been renovated  
 but the poorer housing has been       
 demolished.                           </content>
