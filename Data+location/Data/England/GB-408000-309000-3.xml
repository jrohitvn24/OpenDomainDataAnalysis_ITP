		<title>03 Farewell: The Hall.</title>
		<content>     Farewell Hall is a large red brick
building standing near to the church.  
Its origins are very old, being        
built   for the hermitage which was at 
Farewell before the nuns. Later it was 
turned into a farm house during Queen  
Anne's reign. It fell into a bad state 
of repair and then it was taken        
over.Now it is a training centre for a 
national company.                      
     Inside the hall, upstairs there   
are 14 bedrooms.They have long wooden  
beams that came from barges. Each room 
has 2 beds and some have wash basins.  
The cellar was once used as a slaughter
room but is now a wine store.There is a
secret passage leading from the        
cellar.It is thought that it once led  
to  Farewell church.
