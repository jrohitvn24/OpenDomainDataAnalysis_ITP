		<title>09Farming in the area</title>
		<content>   The land is very flat and until     
 about 20 years ago when the River     
 Roden was straightened and its' banks 
 built up the land was very marshy.    
 Occasionally the river still floods   
 and because it is 3 metres above the  
 land on either side it causes a lot of
 problems. Most farms are about 150    
 acres in size. North of the River     
 Roden it is mainly arable and corn,   
 suger beet and potatoes are grown. Mr.
 Lay is an arable farmer at the Ditches
 Farm. South of the River Roden it is  
 mainly livestock farming.In this area,
 that means mostly cows, with some pigs
 and sheep. Mr. Stokes at Commonwood   
 Farm is a livestock farmer.He has a   
 herd of 120 friesians which he keeps  
 for the milk.The calves are fattened  
 for beef.Most of the milk goes to be  
 made into cheese but a little is made 
 into butter.                          </content>
