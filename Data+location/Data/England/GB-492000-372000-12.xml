		<title>12Lowfields Farm</title>
		<content> Lowfields farm is owned by Mr and Mrs 
 Wright. On their hundred and fifty    
 acres they grow wheat, spring and     
 winter barley and sugar beet. They    
 also keep a beef herd and have one    
 Hereford bull which is ten years old. 
 They breed chickens and geese but have
 a problem with a fox.                 
 Mr Wright and his wife employ no other
 labour and work the farm alone. They  
 have two sons at school who help      
 during the holidays. They have a dog  
 called Skip who catches all the rats. 
 There are five tractors used on the   
 farm, all for different purposes. The 
 farm has recently lost twelve acres   
 owing to the new Lincoln by-pass being
 built across the land. This has made  
 access difficult because it has cut   
 his farm land in two.
