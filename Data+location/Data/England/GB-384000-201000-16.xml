		<title>16CANAL BRIMSCOMBE STROUD</title>
		<content>{STROUDWATER CANAL}runs along the      
 valley bottom in an Easterly direction
 from Stroud,through Thrupp, to        
 Brimscombe.The valley is shared with  
 the A419 Cirencester road,the river   
 Frome and the railway line to Swindon.
 Originally the canal was an important 
 link between the woollen mills and the
 river Severn with Brimscombe Port a   
 hive of activity.The Thames Severn    
 canal was an extension of the         
 Stroudwater eastwards through the     
 Sapperton tunnel but was never very   
 successful financially.Today many     
 miles of the canal are overgrown and  
 weedbound and one section has had a   
 factory built on top of it.It is still
 possible for fishermen to have some   
 Coarse sport and it is excellent for  
 seeing little grebe,flycatchers,      
 kingfishers and in 1985 the first     
 sighting of a  Cetti's Warbler.       </content>
