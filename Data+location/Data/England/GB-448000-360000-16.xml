		<title>16A Day at Daneswood School.</title>
		<content>    For transport we use my dad's car  
 because he is the headteacher of my   
 school. Every morning we set off from 
 Cutthorpe at ten minutes to eight to  
 travel the seventeen miles to Skegby. 
 I come into school at about twenty to 
 nine to put out the hymn books for    
 assembly. After this we have maths    
 until morning break. After break it   
 might be swimming, drama or language  
 work. Then it is lunchtime. Some      
 children have a cooked lunch and some 
 of them bring sandwiches. After lunch 
 it might be P.E. where we have as     
 chance to run about and let off a     
 little steam. After P.E. it is always 
 "Singing Together" which is really    
 boring. Then we normally have topic   
 work or English or we might have      
 games. We do not have a break in the  
 afternoon but we do finish quite early
 at twenty past three.                 </content>
