		<content> Most of the houses in the erea are    
 detached allthough there are a few    
 that are seme detached.The average    
 house was built in Georgian times.    
 Farm houses are mainly large and built
 in the late 17th century.In the erea  
 there are only a few mobile homes that
 are in bad condition.There is only    
 one thatched house as thatch is hard  
 to                                    
 get.Most houses are in good condition 
 and of a fair sise.It is interesting  
 that although most houses are old     
 hardly any were built before          
 1600.There are holiday homes on Burtle
 road as is the church at the          
 crossroads that leed onto Burtle road.
 Mr Richards (the ouner of the post    
 office) owns the holiday homes.
