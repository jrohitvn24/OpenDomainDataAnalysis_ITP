		<title>02MORRIS DANCING</title>
		<content> Morris dancing is dancing to music.   
 Some times we use sticks and sometimes
 hankies. You wear a kind of cape with 
 a white shirt. You can do it with six 
 or eight people. Each person has his  
 or her partner opposite them so you   
 dance in two parallel lines. You hit  
 your partners stick which we call     
 clashing, and sometimes you hit the   
 ground. With hankies you whirl them   
 round and clap your hands. On the 4th 
 of December 1984 we went over to      
 Paignton College with lots of other   
 schools. Our team consists of Clare,  
 Emma, Nicola, Marcus, Graham and me.  
 We did a dance called "In an English  
 Country Garden." We are hoping to do  
 some more this summer with lots of    
 people watching us.
