		<title>01OTMOOR - AN OVERVIEW</title>
		<content>The area of countryside that comprises 
this Block, to the southeast of the    
village of Charlton-on-Otmoor in       
Oxfordshire, maybe described as unique 
in this part of the County.Almost      
totally flat,it owes its origin to the 
fact that it formed an ancient lakebed 
in past geological times and therefore 
the soils of the area are of a clay    
nature.Known for its solitude and its  
wetness very few inhabitants live on   
the moor.It is a haven for wildlife,   
particularly birds who use the wetlands
as a resting point on flights between  
the Severn Estuary and the Wash.The    
Romans successfully crossed the moor   
when they constructed a road linking   
Alchester and Dorchester-on-Thames but 
the area remained an unhealthy         
marshland until the early 1800's when  
enclosure and drainage projects were   
initiated to improve the land.         </content>
