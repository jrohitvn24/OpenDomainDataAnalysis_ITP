		<content> The last resident P.C.was withdrawn in
 1970.for the next 10 years the region 
 was serviced by mobile patrols from   
 Torpoint and Looe.In 1980 a Community 
 Constable was designated to have      
 special responsibility for the main   
 area.This officer has backup          
 assistance when necessary from mobile 
 patrols and specialist departments    
 e.g dog handlers,helicopters,school   
 liason and crime officers(detectives).
  Although there are fewer foot patrols
 and there is less surveillance of the 
 area than formerly ,the advent of     
 radio contact with the control at     
 Launceston means that any major       
 incident ,day or night,will result in 
 police attention within 20 minutes of 
 the initial report.However the absence
 of 'the man in uniform' for long      
 periods is seen as a difficulty in    
 crime prevention.                     </content>
