		<title>17What Jobs People Have.</title>
		<content> The local people are engaged mainly in
 the agricultural, horticultural or    
 forstry industries or the related     
 trades. A few people are retired or   
 semi-retired estate workers with part 
 time or seasonal employment. Some of  
 the remainder are long distance       
 commuters or are engaged in a variety 
 of trades and professions working from
 home and/or in nearby towns, there are
 few without work.                     
 Some of the more unusual occupations  
 that we discovered included a self    
 taught piano tuner and a wood carver. 
 There were few people who practised   
 the ancient rural crafts of hedge     
 laying, dry stone walling or          
 thatching.
