		<title>09INTERVIEW WITH P C LAYCOCK</title>
		<content> I have worked with the Police Force   
 for 9 years. My area includes all of  
 Ifold, Plaistow, Loxwood, Alfold and  
 the Surrey border, Wisborough Green   
 and, in the other direction,          
 Drungewick Lane to Shillinglea.       
{The main change in police work has    
{been the traffic.}There were not very 
 many cars when I started but now there
 are lots more. I do about 25 jobs a   
 week and I attend about 100 accidents 
 a year and about 10 burglaries. My    
 truncheon is made from ebony and the  
 strap from leather. I share a police  
 car with my partner, Mr Tester, who   
 has an area of Wisborough Green,      
 Kirdford and Balls Cross.             
 I often go into the{local school}to   
 see what the children are doing. I    
 also{coach the boys for cricket}at the
 recreation ground.
