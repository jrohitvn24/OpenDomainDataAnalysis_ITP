		<title>01Area around Gunwen Lowertown</title>
		<content> This area of land stretches from the  
 Luxulyan-Lockengate road northeast to 
 the foot of Helman Tor. The western   
 part consists of small farms, the     
 farmhouses are old stone built        
 dwellings, there is Trevelloin (very  
 old) Penhale, Corgee, Higher middle &amp; 
 lower Gurtla and Gunwen. The land is  
 mainly laid to grass, short or medium 
 term ley for harvesting and grazing.  
 The centre part of the area, which is 
 around the hamlet of Gunwen is part   
 grassland and part moorland, very wet 
 with a lot of willow. The chapel at   
 Gunwen was built on the site of the   
 first Bible Christian chapel which was
 built on land given by the founder of 
 that movement William O'Brien or      
 Bryant, he was born at Gunwen Farm in 
 1778, and died at New York, 1868.  The
 eastern part of this block is very wet
 with much willow and ruses,           </content>
