             SIR JAMES SMITH SCHOOL    
 In 1679 land was bought to support the
 school.Sir James Smith paid money to  
 it hoping he would be made MP.In 1872 
 Sir James Smith's School was opened.  
 The school was meant for both boys and
 girls but girls weren't allowed to go 
 until 1905.It was then a boarding     
 school.Children came from Plymouth to 
 go to school.After World War 2 the    
 population in the school rose.A new   
 school was opened and built in 1962.  
 Over 600 children now attend from     
 Crackington Haven down to Port Isaac  
 and inland from Warbstow to           
 St.Breward.Most come in on buses.     </content>
