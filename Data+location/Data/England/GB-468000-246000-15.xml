		<content>    Do both parents work? How far do   
 they travel and how much time do they 
 spend travelling to work? These were  
 the questions that we set out to      
 answer:                               
                                       
    We found out in our survey, that   
 the majority of people worked in      
 Towcester and the surrounding         
 villages, with many people working in 
 Northampton, Milton Keynes and London.
    Those working in Towcester tend to 
 be the wives, while the husbands      
 travel.                               
    Out of{167}questionnaires that were
 sent out,{99}replied that both parents
 worked.
