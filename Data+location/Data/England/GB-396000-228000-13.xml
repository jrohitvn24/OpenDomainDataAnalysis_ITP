		<title>13Traffic in Gotherington</title>
		<content> Although Gotherington is a fairly     
 small village it has quite a busy road
 passing through it which links the    
 village to Winchcombe, Cheltenham,    
 Tewkesbury and Evesham. Most of the   
 traffic is through traffic. Commuters 
 to work provide the bulk of this      
 traffic in the early mornings and     
 evenings.In a recent survey carried   
 out by the local school over a period 
 of three days it was found that       
 approximately 80 vehicles per hour    
 pass through the village between 8am  
 and 6pm.Most of these vehicles were   
 private cars although there were a few
 lorries,vans,motorbikes and tractors  
 included in this total.Traffic passes 
 by a various speeds as there is no    
 speed limit in the village. This makes
 it particularly hazardous for         
 pedestrians as does the absence of    
 street lighting.                      </content>
