		<title>16Ladock&amp;Grampound Rd Housing</title>
		<content>  Grampound Road is a developing       
 village with a modern housing estate, 
 while Ladock ,2 miles away, has had   
 less than 20 new houses built in the  
 past 40 years.                        
  The few modern houses in Ladock are  
 built of concrete blocks which are    
 manufactured nearby. The majority of  
 the houses are between 75 and 200     
 years old and are made of stone which 
 is quarried locally. There are a few  
 very old houses  which are built of   
 cob.                                  
  A survey of houses in Grampound Road 
 shows that most of the older houses   
 were built when the station opened in 
 the village in 1859. The very new ones
 have been built since it became usual 
 for most families to have a           
 car.Villagers need a car in order to  
 get to work and to the towns.
