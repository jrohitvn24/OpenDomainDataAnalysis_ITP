		<title>01THE TOWN OF BULWELL.</title>
		<content> Saint Mary's Church chimes the hour in
 the quaint old town of Bulwell.An old 
 community where nothing much happens. 
 Always calm never out of the ordinary.
 The old wheels go round as the nearby 
 Hucknall colliery produces coal which 
 both communitys depend on.Down on the 
 market Armies of salesmen try to sell 
 goods at a fair price.They call from  
 behind there makeshift counters trying
 to out shout the salesmen on the other
 side of town.Then the battle of the   
 stallholders is over and they pack up 
 and go.On Bulwell bogs its a hot day  
 and children scream with delight as   
 they run riot down the Lean the place 
 buzzes with excitement.From the river 
 the back of the old town hall is in   
 clear view.Bulwell town is very       
 deceiving sometimes calm sometimes    
 very alarming.                        
                                       </content>
