		<content> The 250,000 sq. metres is divided as  
 follows: Buildings - 10%, Coal Stocks 
 - 30%, Agriculture - 40%, Training    
 area - 10%, Roads, Rail, Transformers 
 - 10%. The staff consists of 285      
 manual workers, 16 office staff, 14   
 maintenance, 31 operators &amp; 8         
 chemists. Only 11 staff can keep the  
 staion functional overnight. The coal 
 stocks will cope with industrial      
 disputes for 6 months. Although many  
 chemicals are used, pollution is      
 practically nil and safety is given a 
 high priority. The 2 cooling towers   
 are 200 ft. high and in the more      
 active newer section, the 3 chimneys  
 are 270 ft. high.  These along with   
 the 2 main buildings dominate the     
 skyline and are visible from many     
 miles away.
