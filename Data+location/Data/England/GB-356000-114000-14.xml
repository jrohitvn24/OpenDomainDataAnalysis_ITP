		<title>14Yeovil Sewage Works.</title>
		<content> The sewage passes through 8 filters   
 and is turned into sludge, it smells  
 terrible. 20,000 gallons of sludge    
 pass through every day. In summer     
 there is 3 times as much sewage as in 
 winter. After the sludge has been put 
 in a humus tank the water is drained  
 off and dried it is bagged up to go to
 gardens and farms. All the water goes 
 down the river. The chemicals that    
 go down the the kitchen               
 sink and toilet makes quite a         
 lot of white foam. They get well paid.
 They have only had one overflow which 
 was when one screen fell down and the 
 telephone wires broke. The workers    
 don't mind getting dirty. It is very  
 important to the  population of       
 Yeovil.
