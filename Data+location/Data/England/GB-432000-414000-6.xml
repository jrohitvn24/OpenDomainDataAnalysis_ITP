		<content>   The increased use and availability  
 of the motor car is rapidly altering  
 our area. Housing development in the  
 area has continued for many years     
 around the once isolated communities  
 of Walton, Pledwick and Kettlethorpe. 
   The vast majority of these new homes
 have been built in this area because  
 with a car people can easily get to   
 the big cities such as Wakefield,     
 Leeds,Dewsbury and Barnsley.          
   Opportunities for employment within 
 the area are few but it is very       
 popular with people who work else-    
 where.  It is still reasonably quiet  
 despite the building that has taken   
 place and there is still some nice    
 country around it.But what will the   
 future hold? Will the country give way
 to more housing as demand for housing 
 increases? Will landowners be able to 
 resist attractive offers for land?    </content>
