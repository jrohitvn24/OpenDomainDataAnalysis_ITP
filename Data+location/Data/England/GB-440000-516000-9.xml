		<title>09Coathamstob Brick Works</title>
		<content> The brickworks are owned by Westbrick 
 and employ 88 people.The local clay   
 reserves date from the ice age over 1 
 million years ago.A conveyor belt     
 brings the clay from a stock pile to  
 be checked for stones.Anything larger 
 than 0.8mm is crushed into powder. The
 clay is then mixed with water, passed 
 through a compacting machine from     
 which it emerges as a solid column    
 and is then cut into individual       
 bricks.                               
 They are dried for about 2 days in    
 ovens using hot air from the kilns.   
 The temperature in the 18 kilns, fired
 by gas is slowly raised to 1000c to   
 bake 53,000 bricks at a time.Cooling  
 takes 3 or 4 days and production is   
 half a million per week and 25m.      
 annually.
