		<content> In 1838 Sir Peter Fleetwood gave his  
 new town of Fleetwood, land in        
 whichthe inhabitants could bury their 
 dead. He would not allow burials to   
 take place in the church yard. The    
 earliest tomb stone was dated 1839.   
 Many stones detailed lists of babies  
 and young children who died before    
 they reached the age of 5, during the 
 nineteenth and twentieth centuries.   
 Some gravestones gave details of      
 drownings at sea and deaths in the    
 first and second World Wars.
