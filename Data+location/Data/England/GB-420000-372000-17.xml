		<content> A623 at Calver carries much heavy     
 traffic on a carriageway about 7.5 m  
 in width. At the crossroads there are 
 traffic lights. Many cars at weekends 
 stop nearby to call at the Garden     
 Centre and sweetshop. Congestion      
 results. B6001 on Calver Hill is      
 gradually subsiding on the eastern    
 side and has been patched. From the   
 summit to Hassop, the road is         
 tree-lined. Carriageway width is about
 6 m. The road is busiest on Monday,   
 market day in Bakewell.               
 An unclassified road links Hassop to  
 Longstone. It is lightly trafficked   
 except for large vehicles which       
 deliver live chickens to a processing 
 station at Longstone. The road is as  
 little as 4.5 m wide in places and at 
 Hassop is tightly enclosed by walls.
