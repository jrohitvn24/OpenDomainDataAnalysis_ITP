		<title>17Cecilia's Day (aged 9)</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30 and have Weetabix,   
 crackers and weak coffee for          
 breakfast. I go to school at 8.50.The 
 teacher blows the whistle at 9 and we 
 get into line.We have lessons until   
 10.40 when it is playtime. There is a 
 school shop in the hall. After play we
 get changed for PE where sometimes we 
 play Kingball - a game where one      
 person tries to hit another with the  
 ball; if you are hit, then you are    
 out. At noon I go home for my lunch   
 school restarts at 1 when we have     
 lessons until 2.15 when there is      
 another break, school finishing at    
 3.30. Back at home I have a drink and 
 a biscuit and watch television -      
 programmes like Dramarama and         
 Cornonation Street. I have supper at  
 9.30 before going to bed then my Mum  
 puts my light out about 10.30 and     
 gives me a kiss goodnight.            </content>
