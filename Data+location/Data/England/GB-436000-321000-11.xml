		<content> The woods &amp; copses provide shelter for
 a wide variety of animal life. Foxes  
 are present in considerable numbers as
 are badgers,hares &amp; rabbits. Stock of 
 the latter is kept down by the        
 recurrence of myxomatosis from time to
 time, A few roe deer roam the area    
 doing considerable damage to growing  
 crops in the fields &amp; raiding gardens 
 during hard winter weather.Muntjak    
 have been seen but seldom more than   
 one pair.There are many smaller       
 animals in quite large numbers such as
 weasels, hedgehogs, rats, water voles,
 grey squirrels &amp; the occasional coypu.
 There is evidence of much activity by 
 moles &amp; as the mole catcher is a      
 vanishing breed they continue to      
 multiply.
