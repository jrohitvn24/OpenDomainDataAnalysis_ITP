		<title>06**    A DAY IN MY LIFE    **</title>
		<content> When I wake up I get washed, brush my 
 teeth and get dressed. After that I go
 down and get my breakfast. Next we    
 have to get our bags and coats and go 
 to school. Our Mum crosses us over the
 main road and then we go the way where
 we drop Sarah, my younger sister,off  
 at her school then I and Susan, my    
 twin sister, go to our school. In our 
 school we learn English,Maths, French,
 Geography, Science and many more      
 things. The day goes very quickly. I  
 like most teachers at our school.     
 Today I do English, Maths, French and 
 Games. When I get home I wash my      
 hands, go upstairs and get changed.   
 Then I play in the garden until my tea
 is ready. After tea I go out for a    
 ride on my bike to my friend who lives
 in another street. After playing I    
 watch television. Later I go to bed.
