		<content>{   ST. LEONARD'S CHURCH, COTHERIDGE   
                                       
      The 1961 ordnance survey map     
 shows the church as 'in ruins', but it
 is, in fact, in the process of restor-
 ation and is partly usable.  It is a  
 small church, for many years closely  
 associated with the Berkeley family of
 Cotheridge Court.  The chancel and    
 nave date from the 12th century and   
 are of plastered sandstone.  A timber 
 tower of chestnut and oak, with hipped
 roof, was added in the 15th century.  
 During the 17th century the North     
 Chapel and the panelled box pews were 
 were built and the church generally   
 restored. It is situated down a lane  
 about five kilometres from Worcester  
 on the A44 road to Bromyard.
