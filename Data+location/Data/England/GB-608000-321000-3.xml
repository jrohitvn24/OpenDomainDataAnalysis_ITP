		<content>  a half legs and much of the canopy   
 has gone,but what remains is of high  
 quality.However,the memorable feature 
 of this church is the tomb of Sir     
 Rodger de Kerdiston in the north east 
 corner of the chancel.The large mailed
 figure lies on a bed cobbles,possibly 
 of some allegorical significance.One  
 hand is on the sword,and his feet rest
 on a very large lion.The Font in      
 Reepham church is made of Purpeck     
 Marble.It may have been polished but  
 it does not shine at the moment.It is 
 Norman and stands at the end of the   
 church beneath the west window.It has 
 a pattern on its side showing Norman  
 arches.There is an old Alms box which 
 was used to raise money for the poor  
 people in the parish.It is made of    
 strong oak and Iron straps which makes
 the box even stronger.
