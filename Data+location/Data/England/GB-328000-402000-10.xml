		<title>10QUEEN'S VISIT TO HIGHTOWN</title>
		<content>   A couple of weeks before the visit, 
 some{Irish}people were asking, in the 
 course of conversation with some local
 residents, about where the{ammunition 
 was stored on the{Rifle Range.}This   
 incident was reported to the{Police   
 who immediately started visiting      
 Hightown's houses, asking if anybody  
 unusual had been seen e.g. if any     
 strangers had been seen or if anyone  
 was trying to{rent}houses in Hightown.
  The day before the visit, banners and
 flags were put up around the route the
 Queen was to take. The odd{Lynx       
{helicopter}patrolled the area.        
   On the day itself, many Police and  
{Military Policemen}patrolled from     
 early morning onwards. Crowds began to
 line the streets from about 9.45a.m.  
 Orange tape barriers were put up along
 the Royal route.
