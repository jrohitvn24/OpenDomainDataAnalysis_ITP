		<title>01ADLINGTON / POTT SHRIGLEY</title>
		<content> The designated block lies in the foot 
 hills of the Pennines, rising from 300
 feet in the west to 1200 feet in the  
 east. The higher ground is moorland   
 giving way to rough grazing and       
 pasture as it falls to enclose Pott   
 Shrigley village. A 900 foot ridge,   
 called The Nab, rises steeply from    
 Bollington encircling Pott Shrigley to
 the west so dividing it from Adlington
 Below the moors the land curves gently
 and a number of small streams flow    
 through wooded cloughs to the river   
 Dean. Natural woodland, mosly oak, ash
 sycamore and holly abounds. Fields in 
 the east are bordered by stone walls  
 but these are replaced by hedges in   
 the lower lying west.                 
 The temperate climate is dominated by 
 westerly winds. Rain on the hills is  
 50 to 60 inches annually. Temperatures
 are 60F in July and 37F in January.   </content>
