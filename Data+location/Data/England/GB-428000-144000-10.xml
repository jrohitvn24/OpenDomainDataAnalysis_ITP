		<title>10DUNNINGS OF WEYHILL.</title>
		<content>   A.J.Dunning &amp; Sons Ltd is the       
 largest company in the area and       
 occupies part of the site of the old  
 Weyhill Fairground. The company       
 operates all over the south of England
 &amp; employs about a thousand in the     
 Building &amp; Shopfitting divisions.     
 Employees come mainly from outside    
 Weyhill, local recruitment of staff   
 being difficult. Dunnings also farm   
 2000 acres, mostly arable,in the area.
   We spoke to the Chairman, Mr Victor 
 Dunning, whose father co-founded the  
 firm 60 years ago. Mr Dunning is 83 &amp; 
 has lived in Weyhill since he was 16. 
 Born at Penton &amp; educated locally, he 
 has been on the Church Council for 60 
 years and says he enjoys living in    
 Weyhill. He considers Weyhill to  be  
 primarily an industrial area though   
 our land-cover survey shows it to be  
 largely agricultural.                 </content>
