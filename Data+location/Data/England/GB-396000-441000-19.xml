		<title>19THE HITCHING STONE</title>
		<content> This stone is one of the largest      
 free-standing stones in this part of  
 Yorkshire.It is a mystery as to how it
 came to be in its present position,as 
 it would appear to be out of place    
 when looking at the surrounding       
 countryside,which is mainly moorland. 
{"All alone stands the Hitching Stone, 
{On the moor so poor,stands a mystery  
{That will never be unravelled.        
{On a spooky night,when the moon shone 
{Bright,from Pendle Hill would fly     
{The witches with laughter in their    
{Eyes.Everyone on Hallowe'en would stay
{Away from the witches mean.           
{How did it get there?Did a giant throw
{It through the air?Did the ice-age men
{Who made valleys green put it there   
{For it to be seen?Has it been there   
{From the beginning of the earth,or did
{Someone somewhere give it its birth?"
