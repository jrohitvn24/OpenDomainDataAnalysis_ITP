		<title>12FLOWER CARE:SHELLEY NURSERY</title>
		<content>  The only flowers at Shelley Nursery, 
 Wigley are chrysanthemums.They need   
 only 11 hours daylight otherwise they 
 will produce greenery but no flowers. 
 The cuttings are kept in a special    
 area where there is a black screen,a  
 white screen and electric light,so    
 that the amount of daylight can be    
 controlled.                           
  There are 3 diseases to guard against
 The chrysanthemums get a fungal       
 disease,Potrytis,if the atmosphere is 
 wrong.To cure it the atmosphere must  
 be corrected,or chemicals used.The    
 plants can also get Red Spider Mite,  
 which is treated with larger spiders  
 called Phytosieulus.These eat the     
 mites and then eat each other.Aphids  
 also attack the plants,so they are    
 covered with a fungus which also      
 covers the aphids and kills them.
