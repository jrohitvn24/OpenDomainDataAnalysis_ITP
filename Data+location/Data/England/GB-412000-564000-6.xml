		<title>06THE DAY OF AN INFANT CHILD.</title>
		<content>    I am 5. I go to Ryton Infants. My  
 teacher does the register. We line up 
 to go in the hall.                    
    We work in our sum books. We have  
 milk in school. We get our coats and  
 go out and play. We play Daleks.      
    We write in our writing books then 
 we draw pictures. I read to Mrs. Teal.
    We wash our hands and go into the  
 hall. The other day we had fish and   
 chips and mushy peas and apple pie    
 with custard. I usually get seconds.  
 We go out and play funny monster      
 games.                                
    In school we play with our toys -  
 "Lego",jigsaws,clay and plasticine. We
 sometimes paint and make things. At   
 home time we have a story or a tape.  
 We get our coats and get our mammy.
