		<title>20RELIGION IN OLDBURY</title>
		<content>  The first known place of worship in  
 Oldbury was a chapel-of-ease, built in
 1529. Oldbury was a stronghold of     
 early non-conformity and it still has 
 a rich variety of styles of worship.  
 The parish church of Christ Church was
 built in 1841. It recently faced a    
 decline in attendance and was         
 threatened with closure but a revival 
 of interest has taken place. There is 
 a R.C. church, St. Francis Xavier,    
 built in 1965, but the non-conformist 
 tendency is still in evidence for the 
 pentecostal churches of the Bethel    
 Temple and the New Testament Church of
 God are still very well attended. In  
 the area there is also a Temple of    
 Light, a Zion Methodist Church and a  
 House Mosque for Muslims.
