 This area is predominantly rural with 
 agriculture and associated activities 
 the main charcteristics.              
 The two main settlements in the area, 
 the villages of{Cliffe}and            
{Hemingbrough,}have expanded           
 considerably in the last five years.  
 In part this is due to their position 
 on the edge of the multi-million pound
 development of the{Selby Coalfield.   
 Other factors relating to their growth
 are the proximity of the villages to  
 the M62 motorway which provides easy  
 access for commuters to Hull and to   
 Leeds, West Yorkshire and Lancashire, 
 and the relative low cost of housing  
 in attracive villages.                
 Despite their growth the communities  
 still retain their village identities.
 In the pages ahead we describe life as
 it appears to us in 1985.             </content>
