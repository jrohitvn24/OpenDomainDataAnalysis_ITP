		<content> Home produced vegetables,cream and    
 milk are available at the farm shop,  
 and groceries and frozen foods at the 
 general stores.                       
 Many housewives freeze their own fresh
 vegetables and fruit ready for winter 
 use, storing them in deep freezers.   
 Cooking is done with either solid     
 fuel, gas, electric or oil fired      
 cookers.  Every household has mains   
 water supplied by the Water Board and 
 electricity by the Electricity Board. 
 These are paid for by a quarterly     
 account.   Each house has its own     
 sanitation system _ mostly septic tank
 drainage.  The nearest school is 3    
 miles away, and a bus collects the    
 children. There is a mobile library   
 which serves the area.                
 The car is a necessary mode of        
 transport.
