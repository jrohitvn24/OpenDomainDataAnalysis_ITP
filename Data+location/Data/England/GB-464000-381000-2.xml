		<content>   Until the late eighteenth century   
 much of the land lay in waste or in   
 commons that provided poor grazing for
 sheep.                                
   The sandy soils, that had not       
 attracted Anglian settlers, could not 
 be cultivated profitably by           
 traditional methods. Rainfall is      
 relatively low (0.5 in. per year) and 
 what rain falls soon drains away.     
 Further, these light, arid soils tend 
 to blow in strong winds.              
   By 1790, however, the local         
 landowners, notably the Bridgman -    
 Simpson family of Babworth Hall, had  
 the will, the inclination, and the    
 capital to enclose the land, create   
 large compact farms, and introduce new
 techniques.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
