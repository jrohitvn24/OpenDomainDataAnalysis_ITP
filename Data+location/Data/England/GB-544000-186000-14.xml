		<content>{Recreation in Seven Kings.}           
 In our area, which is Seven Kings, we 
 were looking at recreation. We saw    
 what was available. There was Seven   
 Kings Park, the Ford's Sports Ground, 
 Westwood Recreation and School Playing
 Fields.                               
{Seven Kings Park}                     
 Seven Kings Park is a large park; it  
 has four park keepers. They do not    
 like having dogs in the park and      
 would ban them if they could. They do 
 not allow{cycling}in the park but this
 rule is often disobeyed.              
 All types of people go to the park,   
 especially the young, but swings and  
 other equipment are often vandalised. 
 There is a stream where people pic-nic
 in the summer.{Tennis clubs}use the   
 park for practice.
