		<content>This present-day amenity area was once 
owned by Sir Robert Peel. The park     
covers 160 acres. This includes lakes  
and 15-acre zoo, extensive amusement   
parks, cafterias and restaurants,a     
garden-centre, a toy/novelty shop and a
pottery shop. The zoo is well stocked  
with lions, bears, sea-lions, penguins,
tropical birds, water fowl and llamas, 
to name but a few. The reptile house   
has a large selection of animals, and a
farm section has most animals found on 
British farms. There is a pets' corner 
where children are encouraged to       
participate. There is a lost world     
collection of 24 types of dinosaurs,   
all life-size. A nature-trail covers 42
acres of woodland and water courses.
