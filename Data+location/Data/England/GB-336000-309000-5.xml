		<content>   Mr.and Mrs.Hooper own the{Grange old
{people's home.}It was already a home  
 when they bought it.When it was first 
 built it was the Rectory.It is a very 
 large house with a big garden and is  
 just next to the church and school.   
 After they bought it they made lots of
 changes,re-decorated it and bought    
 special chairs to help lower old      
 people into the bath.Some residents   
 have rooms of their own,some share.Old
 people go to live there because they  
 are too old or ill to look after      
 themselves.There are 26 old ladies and
 three men living there at the moment. 
 There are 26 staff counting a few who 
 live there.The residents come from    
 Montford Bridge,Pontesbury,Westbury   
 Halfway House,Ford,Yockleton,Hadnall, 
 Shrewsbury,Manchester,London and      
 Switzerland.
