		<title>17THOUGHTS ABOUT MY HOME TOWN</title>
		<content> I live in{Waltham Abbey.}The area I   
 live in is called{Roundhills.}I like  
 going to the{video shop}and{chip shop-
 which has that lovely greasy smell!   
 The town has a{market}every{Tuesday   
 and{Saturday}- they have all different
 stalls, such as fruit; health-food;   
 clothes;make-up, and material stalls. 
 I like living in the Abbey and going  
 to school. I particularly enjoy       
 colouring patterns, Maths, and art.I  
 am nearly 11 years old.               
                                       
 In Waltham Abbey, near the church,    
 there is a{rose garden.}In this garden
 there are hundreds of plants, which   
 smell particularly nice in the        
 evening. It is a favourite place for  
 pensioners on a sunny afternoon.      
 The line of{Greenwich Meridian}goes   
 through the rose gardens - its        
 position is noted by a plaque.        </content>
