		<title>02Farming in the Cuckney area.</title>
		<content> The underlying rock is{bunter         
{sandstone}.There is quite a depth of  
 sandy topsoil in which are many small 
 rounded pebbles left by the sea       
 millions of years ago.These enable the
 soil to soak up water.Mr.F.Palmer     
 of Norton Grange Farm says that an    
 advantage of this is that the soil can
 be worked soon after heavy rain,but   
 disadvantages are that a great deal of
 water is needed and the soil is acid  
 and short of lime.                    
 Because of the soil ,long rooted crops
 do best.Main crops grown in the area  
 are barley,wheat,sugarbeet,potatoes,  
 mustard seed,and oil seed rape.       
 Lime,calcium,nitrogen,and potash are  
 necessary fertilizers.In dry weather  
 cannon sprinklers and self irrigation 
 sprinklers are much used.Field sizes  
 vary from 10 to 30 acres and are      
 divided by fences or hedges.          </content>
