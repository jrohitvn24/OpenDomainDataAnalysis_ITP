		<content> Hiltingbury is a quiet residential    
 area of Chandler's ford. One of it's  
 main features being the trees which   
 line the roads and dominate the       
 gardens.                              
                                       
 Evidence from{Tumulii}show the area   
 was used in the{Bronze Age}and it is  
 known that the woodland around was    
 tenanted by copyholders.              
                                       
 In more recent times the land to the  
 West was farmed. A new housing estate 
 now covers the old{Hiltonbury Farm}and
 more of the area is being sold for    
 future expansion.                     
                                       
 During World War Two 10,000 troops    
 assembled for ther D-Day Landings in  
 Hiltingbury. Later the area was used  
 as a camp by Polish refugees.
