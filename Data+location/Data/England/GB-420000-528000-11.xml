		<title>11TOWN'S EFFECT ON FARMING</title>
		<content> As Bishop Auckland  grows, houses and 
 jobs are needed.Mr.Forster used to    
 have{120-140 acres of good farmland.} 
 In 1972 Henknowle{School}was built on 
 one of his fields.In 1975, 52 acres   
 were taken for the Henknowle{Housing  
{Estate}and 35 acres for the South     
 Church{Industrial Estate.}Now he has  
 lost more land for a new{by-pass      
{road.}The farm's future is uncertain. 
 Since 1976 Mr.Forster has rented some 
 poor quality{reclaimed colliery land }
 1km east and southeast of the farm.   
 He wishes the industrial estate had   
 been built on the land instead.       
{Dogs}from the town worry the animals. 
 Some do not put on weight. Some{sheep}
 have died.{Children}sometimes break   
 the fences. The town means that       
 Mr.Forster can{sell}his meat{locally. 
 He says{farming}is the best job there 
 is!                                   </content>
