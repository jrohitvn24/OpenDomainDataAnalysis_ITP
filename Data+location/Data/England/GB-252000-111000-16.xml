		<title>16OUR WEEKENDS</title>
		<content>     The weekends provide opportunities
 for children to relax from the routine
 of school,even though they wake early.
     Debbie Steer writes---"On Saturday
 I woke up at around 7:00 A.M.and read 
 'The Ship of Adventure'.Then I watched
 'Good Morning Britain'on television." 
                                       
     Not everyone rises quite so early 
 ,especially on Sundays.               
     Tracey Hunt writes---"At Ten I had
 just woken.After breakfast we went to 
 the{Playing Field}to play Cricket."   
                                       
     The traditional Sunday lunch      
 (refered to as "dinner") is still very
 popular in {Merton }.                 
     Marie Weeks writes---"At 9:00 I   
 was helping mum put the meat on for   
 dinner."                              
     Rebecca Geary writes---"I played  
 on the lawn then I had roast dinner." </content>
