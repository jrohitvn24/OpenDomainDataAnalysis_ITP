		<content>  Maxine Dewis gets out of bed,puts on 
 a skirt and jumper,then goes          
 downstairs.She pours herself a cup of 
 coffee,but waits for it to cool before
 drinking it.For breakfast she         
 sometimes has cornflakes with milk and
 sugar added to them.She then goes back
 upstairs to the bathroom and cleans   
 her teeth.First she squeezes a        
 substance,known as toothpaste,out of a
 tube onto a toothbrush.The brush has  
 a long plastic handle with bristles at
 one end.The bristles clean away any   
 particles of food from your teeth,and 
 the paste helps to protect your teeth 
 and makes your mouth clean and fresh. 
 She brushes her hair to make it neat  
 and tidy.For this she uses a larger   
 brush.To go to school she puts on a   
 coat,for warmth,and either leather or 
 plastic shoes to protect her feet from
 the hard and dirty ground.            </content>
