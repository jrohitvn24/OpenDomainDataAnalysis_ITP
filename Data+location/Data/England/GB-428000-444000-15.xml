		<content>   The training stables near Harewood  
 cover 108 acres.The workers include   
 jockeys and 22 stable hands aged 18 to
 27. The care,feeding and exercising of
 the horses occupies 12 hours daily.It 
 costs Â£14 a day to train and keep a   
 horse.There are veterinary fees,and   
 race entry fees ranging between Â£10   
 and Â£20 a race.Other expenses include 
 special light aluminium plate horse   
 shoes,individual saddles and bridles. 
                                       
   Most of the horses are Irish owned. 
 Most races entered are in the British 
 Isles as the courses and jumps differ 
 on the Continent.A horse will be      
 entered for 7 or 8 races a year.The   
 owners,trainers and jockeys each get a
 percentage of the prize money.
