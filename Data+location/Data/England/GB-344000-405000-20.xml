		<content>  The work contained in this survey    
 formed part of a term's project on our
 environment. The project was conducted
 by all the children of Class 1, Crow  
 Orchard County Primary School under   
 the guidance of their class teacher   
 Mr. G. Cooke and the headmaster Mr. P.
 A.Caine during June and July 1985.    
  Written contributions were made by:  
 Amanda McManus      David Peel        
 Kerry Wilson        Andrew Duffy      
 Christine Crompton  Jamie Dolan       
 Chey Cummings       Steven Mitchell   
 Nicola Williams     Chris Gray        
 Sandra Wadkin       Darren Rothwell   
  All these children were aged 10 to 11
 years at the time of the project.     
  They have all lived in the town for  
 the major part of their lives.All the 
 families had originally moved here    
 from Liverpool seeking employment in  
 the New Town.                         </content>
