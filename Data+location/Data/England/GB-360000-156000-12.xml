		<content> Between 1923 and 1968 the old mill    
 buildings remained unchanged.In 1968 a
 tied bungalow was built.In 1979 the   
 mill passed down to a third generation
 of Blackers (all called Frank).       
 Initially dairy farming and calf      
 breeding continued.In 1982-1983 the   
 bungalow and 54 acres of land were    
 sold to a neighbouring farmer and the 
 mill was turned into Kennels.The main 
 building is still a dwelling house and
 has been extensively renovated in     
 recent years,although most of the main
 characteristics remain.In 1985 a      
 Cattery is being added to the Kennels.
 The mill wheel was destroyed many     
 years ago and the mill pond filled in 
 in 1971 for safety reasons.Camely Mill
 or Mill Farm as it is now known       
 consists of 37 acres used mainly for  
 grazing beef and making hay.
