		<content> Wolvey was known as 'Ulveia' in the   
 Domesday Book of 1086.The{CHURCH}of St
 John the Baptist, originally Norman,  
 is a building of Attleboro' sandstone 
 chiefly in the decorated style. It has
 a tower of the late 15th century      
 containing six bells.                 
 Wolvey Hall reputedly built in 1676 in
 place of an earlier mansion destroyed 
 during the{CIVIL WAR}is the property  
 of Mrs Burbage who is a member of the{
{COAPE-ARNOLD}family.                  
 At the Norman Conquest, Wolvey was    
 granted to Robert de Vesci, who held  
 here a manor comprising the village   
 and a church. It later became the     
 property of the Newburghs, Earls of   
 Warwick, who sold it to the Bassetts  
 and from them the{HALL}and manor      
 passed, circa 1250, to the de Wolveys,
 with whose descendents it remained    
 until 1780.                           </content>
