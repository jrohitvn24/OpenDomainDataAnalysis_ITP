		<content>{Charlie Knight}has built more than    
 twenty-two crazy bikes. He built the  
 first one in 1963 to entertain        
 people.When he started to build his   
 crazy bikes, people asked him to come 
 to their fetes. He has been asked to  
 do twenty-six television shows,       
 including "That's Life" with Esther   
 Rantzen. He won the television award  
 for the craziest bike on television.  
 The bike which won was called Jezebel.
 To ride Jezebel, you have to pedal    
 backwards to go forwards, and when you
 turn the handlebars to the right, the 
 bike turns left, and when you turn the
 handlebars to the left, the bike turns
 right. Only one or two people can ride
 her without falling off. Another bike 
 is called 'Upsy', because the pedals  
 are at the top with the handlebars,   
 and the saddle is down below.
