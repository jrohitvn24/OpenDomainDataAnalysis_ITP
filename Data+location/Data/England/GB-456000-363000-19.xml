		<title>19School Bird Survey</title>
		<content>  During the spring of 1985 our class  
 carried out a survey of the birds     
 which either visited or we could see  
 from our school grounds. We were very 
 surprised at the total number of      
 different birds that we saw. These    
 were the birds we recorded in the     
 spring:Heron,Kestrel,Woodpigeon, Blue 
 Tit,Mistle Thrush,Song Thrush,        
 Blackbird,Robin,Pied Wagtail, Starling
 Greenfinch,Goldfinch,Linnet, Chaffinch
 House Sparrow.                        
  Later in the year House Martins and  
 Swifts were seen. Later still Swifts  
 were seen. Many of these summer       
 visitors nest on our houses.          
  We were especially pleased to see    
 several Herons coming from the        
 direction of{Vicar's Pond}and flying  
 north.We have also recorded at other  
 times of the year{seabirds}including  
 Blackbacked Gulls.                    </content>
