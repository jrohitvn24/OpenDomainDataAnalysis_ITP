		<title>17STRUCTURE PLAN - WILLOUGHBY</title>
		<content>                                       
 This policy seems to be working       
 effectively as according to a local   
 resident who has lived in Willoughby  
 all his life, there have only been    
 thirty seven houses built since the   
 plan came into effect.                
                                       
  Although this may seem quite a number
 these houses are of an individual     
 design and fit into the characterof   
 the old village.                      
                                       
  The number of houses built is in     
 contrast to a neighbouring village,   
 which was recently of a similar size  
 but now contains three large, modern  
 housing estates.
