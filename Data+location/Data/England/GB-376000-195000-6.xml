		<title>06EDUCATION IN DURSLEY</title>
		<content>   In 1971 Secondary School            
 re-organisation resulted in the       
 establishment of the Rednock          
 Comprehensive School in Dursley on the
 site of the old grammar school.  The  
 Secondary Modern school buildings at  
 Highfields were occupied by Junior    
 children who had been accommodated on 
 a split site in the town. Infants were
 also housed at Highfields from 1982.  
   At the present there  are 119       
 Infants and 202 Juniors at Dursley    
 Primary School, Highfields. They are  
 taught by 15 full-time and 20         
 part-time teaching staff.             
   There are no official school coaches
 but the parents have arranged the hire
 of a bus which transports about 40    
 children daily from Dursley town      
 centre area. About 30 children have a 
 school meal and 200 have sandwiches.
