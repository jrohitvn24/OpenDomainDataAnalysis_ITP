		<title>17THE OLD RECTORY, CHILMARK</title>
		<content> This remarkable house, known sometimes
 as the{Park,}lies hidden by old beech 
 trees, between the village street and 
 the main road. The{original house,    
 much added to, is built of local      
{limestone}and is{contemporary}with the
 church, that is{14th century.}A whole 
 network of underground culverts and   
 alleged passages carries away flood   
 water and links the house with the    
 churchyard. One of the bedrooms oi the
 old part has a splendid stone         
 fireplace decorated with metal roses, 
 dated 15th century. Many of the       
 original mullioned windows are intact.
 During the{19th century}an incumbent  
 with ten children built on a red brick
 extension, Georgian in style,         
 including a third staircase and a     
 magnificent drawing room. It is this  
 contrast in styles and materials which
 give the house its character. AMcG    </content>
