		<title>03Transport Buses St.Austell</title>
		<content> Cornwall Busways has a bus and coach  
 station adjoining the railway station 
 at St.Austell, which is leased from   
 British Rail.  In 1985 forty-three    
 staff are employed there, including   
 twenty-eight drivers and five         
 mechanics.                            
 Three types of bus are garaged at St. 
 Austell - single deckers, double      
 deckers and minibuses; but a          
 representative of the Busways told us 
 that in the near future, Cornwall will
 probably  have only minibuses on local
 service routes.This is a good idea    
 since many of our roads are narrow and
 winding,and there is traffic          
 congestion in the summer when we have 
 an influx of holiday makers with their
 cars, as well as those of local       
 people. Also the minibuses are often  
 large enough for the number of        
 passengers carried on other buses.    </content>
