		<content>   A special instrument deep inside the
 ground measures earth movements as the
 moon and sun pull the earth.          
   Computers  help  in the  work at the
 Institute  by  processing  infomation 
 received from  the work at sea, and in
 the weather  measurements. Another use
 for their  computers  is  Mathematical
 " Models ". These  are  predictions of
 water movements, like storm surges, in
 harbours or estuarys: eg  in the River
 Thames, for the recent building of the
 flood barrier.                        
   The Institute has even  been able to
 calculate tides of long ago; they have
 worked out tides which brought William
 the Conqueror in 1066.                
   The  Oceanographic  Institute  now  
 employs 100 full_time workers ; 20 are
 computer experts , 40 scientists , and
 40 are administritive officers.
