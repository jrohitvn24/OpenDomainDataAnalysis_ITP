		<title>07SOUTHWICK ESTATE MANAGER</title>
		<content> The manager of Southwick Estate lives 
 at Belney Farm.  Each morning he gets 
 up early and goes to check up on the  
 animals.  He then goes to any of the  
 farms on the estate that need him.    
 After lunch he continues to tour the  
 estate helping out where necessary.The
 manager lives on the farm with his    
 wife and two sons.  His wife does not 
 work on the farm but spins wool from  
 the sheep reared on the estate.  One  
 of his sons drives a tractor and      
 combine harvester, the other one is   
 learning to be a farmer like his      
 father.  The manager has many hobbies 
 including playing golf and snooker and
 watching football.  Occasionally he   
 has to go to the continent of Europe  
 to see how other farms are working.   
 Recently he went to West Germany to   
 see some farms there.
