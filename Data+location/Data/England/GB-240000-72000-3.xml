		<content> In{Latchley}and{Chilsworthy}there are 
 quite a lot of{retired people}who     
 spend their time pursuing a variety of
 interests such as gardening or        
 walking.                              
 There are quite a number of{farmers}in
 our section. The majority are dairy   
 or beef farmers because there is      
 much rough grazing land in the area.  
 The{increase in building}has led to   
 more jobs for{electricians, carpenters
 and{bricklayers.                      
 In a survey we found several men who  
 were in the{navy}or who worked in the 
{Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth.}These   
 people go to work by car.             
 There used to be a good number of     
{market gardeners}in this area but the 
 cost of tranporting produce together  
 with that of heating greenhouses has  
 practically eliminated this.
