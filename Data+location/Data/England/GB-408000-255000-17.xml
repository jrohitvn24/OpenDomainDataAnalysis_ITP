		<title>17OVERSLEY HILL FARM</title>
		<content>       Oversley Hill Farm is situated  
 on an elevated position overlooking   
 Alcester.It has 298.9 acres and about 
 150 sheep and 40 to 50 beef cattle.   
 On the 298.9 acres Mr Corbett grows   
 grass and hay,and corn to feed the    
 cattle.Silage is made by cutting grass
 and baling it in to big round bales   
 and putting in to big plastic bags and
 leaving it for about six months.Then  
 you can feed it to the cattle.        
       The house at Oversley Hill Farm 
 is about A century old.Mr Corbett has 
 traced his family back about 100 years
 and they all had that Farm.Before the 
 Corbetts the Throckmorton family of   
 Coughton owned the land. Mr and Mrs   
 Corbett have four daughters and so the
 family farm will continue to flourish 
 into the next century.
