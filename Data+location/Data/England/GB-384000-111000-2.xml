		<title>02HAMBLEDON HILL NEAR SHROTON</title>
		<content>   THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF THIS
 AREA IS A LONG RIDGE OF CHALK DOWNLAND
 WHICH IS FASCINATING TO THOSE WHO TAKE
 WALKS ON IT TO EXERCISE THEIR DOGS AND
 LOOK AT THE VIEWS OF BEAUTIFUL DORSET 
 COUNTRYSIDE, AND ALSO IS A VERY       
 HISTORIC PLACE.                       
  THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY MARVELS OF THE
 HILL. IT IS GREAT FUN TO CLIMB. ON ONE
 OF THE RAMPARTS IS AN OLD TREE STUMP  
 WHICH LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE A MAN      
 HOLDING A PAIR OF BINOCULARS, WHEN    
 SEEN FROM A DISTANCE. CATTLE GRAZE    
 FREELY BUT LOOK OUT FOR THE OCCASIONAL
 BULL. IF YOU EVER DECIDE TO HAVE A    
 PICNIC THERE HANG ONTO YOUR PAPER     
 TABLENAPKINS AS THEY WILL BLOW ALL    
 OVER THE PLACE. IT IS BEST TO EAT     
 SITTING BETWEEN THE RAMPARTS AS THE   
 WIND IS VERY STRONG EVEN ON A HOT     
 DAY.
