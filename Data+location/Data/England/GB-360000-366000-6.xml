		<content>{Delamere Street Nursery-WINSFORD.     
   This garden nursery has been open   
 for twenty five years. It employs     
 seven people. Most of the plants sold 
 are alpines. The nursery specialises  
 in growing lewisia. Dwarf conifers are
 raised from cuttings. All plants are  
 sold to the general public many of    
 whom are local.                       
   Mr.Mitchell the proprietor travels  
 round the country displaying his      
 plants at shows and buying others. He 
 advertises in Alpine Journals. During 
 the winter of 1985 he intends to      
 replace one of his greenhouses with a 
 polythene tunnel. This new invention  
 will improve growing conditions for   
 his plants.                           
   Gardening is an important leisure   
 time activity of the 1980's, as more  
 people educate themselves through the 
 media of television and books.        </content>
