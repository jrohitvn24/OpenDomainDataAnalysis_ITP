		<title>02SOIL AND TREES OF BEECHES</title>
		<content>The Beeches area is divided by a deep  
valley running from East to West.The   
highest point is about 88metres,the    
lowest is 54metres.The soil is mainly  
clay and sand with some chalk,gravel   
and brick earth.Near the ponds'there is
some boggy land.The Beeches dates back 
to Norman times.Pollarding,or lopping  
of the beech trees for firewood began  
about 1500 and went on to about 1820,  
when coal as fuel became available.In  
1645 Cromwell ordered the trees to be  
pollarded into a domeshape.Today there 
are about 700 pollarded beech trees.The
two oldest trees "The Druids Oak" and  
"His Majesty".The oak is about 450     
years old and 9.2 m in girth and "H.M" 
is thought to be the oldest beech in   
England.
