		<title>20THE FUTURE OF SANDHURST</title>
		<content>CAUSE FOR CONCERN                      
 Sandhurst residents are concerned that
their village is growing, but only as a
dormitory suburb of Gloucester. The    
growth has not brought extra services  
to the village. The newcomers have cars
of their own and do not rely on public 
transport or local shops. They work    
outside Sandhurst and their families   
are too old to use the village school. 
 Young people have to leave the village
to find work, they cannot afford to    
return to the expensive new houses. The
older residents fear that more cars    
will mean demands for widening the     
narrow lanes to the village and a loss 
of hedgerows. The closure of the school
and merging of parishes will lead to a 
loss of village identity.              
 Sadly, the future does not look bright
for Sandhurst, soon the village will   
have changed its character completely. </content>
