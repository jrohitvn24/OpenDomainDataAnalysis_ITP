		<title>02COMING OF HARLOW NEW TOWN.</title>
		<content> In 1930 Marjorie Parker moved to a    
 farm in{Harlow},which was then a few  
 small hamlets surounded by peaceful   
 countryside.She remembers{Lord Silkin,
 the Minister of Town and Country      
 Planning ,introducing in 1946 the{New 
{Towns Act}, mainly because of over-   
 crowding and homelessness in the big  
 cities after the war.She also recalls{
{Leah Manning},our local labour M.P.   
 being involved in planning New Harlow.
  The Residents' Association strongly  
 opposed the building of a town here . 
 Nevertheless many workers wanted the  
 town ,which would bring more homes and
 jobs .They signed a petition for a new
 town and after an enquiry the building
 of Harlow went ahead .Miss Parker also
 remembers Burnt Mill village ,two rows
 of forty houses ,being demolished in  
 1961 to make way for Longmans the     
 Publishers,by the town station.       </content>
