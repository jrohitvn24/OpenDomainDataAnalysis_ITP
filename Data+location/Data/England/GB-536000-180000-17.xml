		<title>17Life In Tower Hamlets(2)</title>
		<content>I think I am very lucky to live in     
Tower Hamlets in 1985 because this area
is not like the City of London it is a 
residencial area.There are enough parks
and open spaces to please everyone.I   
live in a maisonette just off a main   
road.Most people in my class live in a 
block of flats or maisonettes.The buses
are not very good because they get held
up in the city and come in groups but  
the tubes are not bad although they get
a bit crowded.I have 3 big parks near  
me,Shandy,Victoria and Mile End.There  
are courts and pitches at Victoria and 
Mile End for all different kinds of    
sports including tennis,football and   
cricket.They also have swing parks from
about 4 to 13 year olds.We have lots of
things to entertain us.
