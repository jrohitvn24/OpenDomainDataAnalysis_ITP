		<title>18Drusillas Zoo</title>
		<content> You are welcome at Drusillas Zoo any  
 time in the year. Drusillas,like all  
 good zoos,are helping to save the     
 world's endangered species. The       
 animals kept in the zoo include       
 llamas,birds,monkeys,penguins and     
 wallabies. There is also a section    
 devoted to farmyard animals and a     
 nocturnal house which allows you to   
 see some of the creatures that live in
 a twilight world.                     
                                       
 Each year thousands of children visit 
 the zoo on educational trips. Pupils  
 are encouraged to learn about the     
 animals and this is seen as an        
 important part of Drusillas work.     
 Various schemes have been set up to   
 help this including adopting an       
 animal and the Jobex scheme where     
 pupils are encouraged to work         
 alongside the staff of the zoo.       </content>
