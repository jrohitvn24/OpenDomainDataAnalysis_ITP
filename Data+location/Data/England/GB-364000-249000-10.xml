		<content> There are theatres in Hereford.       
 Malvern, and Worcester, where amateur 
 and professional companies perform.   
 Every year there is a festival at     
 Ludlow when leading professional      
 companies perform works of Shakespeare
 in an open air theatre built inside   
 Ludlow castle. Also there is a well   
 attended music and drama festival in  
 Malvern.  The Three Choirs held each  
 year is hosted by Hereford, Worcester,
 and Gloucester in turn.   Choirs are  
 formed from every part of the         
 community.  The three counties        
 agricultural show also used to move   
 around the counties but now has a     
 permanent site just outide Malvern. A 
 small minority visit London for shows,
 while others travel to Birmingham for 
 theatres and the exhibition centre.
