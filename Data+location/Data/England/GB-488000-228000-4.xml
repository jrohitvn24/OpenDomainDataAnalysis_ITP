		<content> In 1910 Mr. Bates was at the          
 National school in Great Brickhill    
 which was opposite the shop           
 and Post Office. They had 2           
 playgrounds. For heat they had an open
 coal fire. The head teacher was Mrs   
 Jones. They had a tripod blackboard in
 the infant and junior                 
 classrooms. Sports                    
 day was always held at the            
 manor belonging to the Duncombes. On  
 the Queen's birthday they put up a    
 flag on the school flagpole. On all   
 the Saints days they went to church.  
 There was no play school. The children
 went to school at about 5yrs old. The 
 oldest was 14yrs. If they had been    
 told off 3 times they would have a    
 choice of the cane or slipper. If they
 were dirty they had their mouth washed
 out with soap and water. They went for
 a nature walk some times.             </content>
