		<title>09Pilgrimages to Glastonbury.</title>
		<content>{Pilgrims}wend their way to{Glastonbury
 every year. The{Roman Catholic}and    
{Anglican}Churches stage separate      
 events.                               
 Thousands of Pilgrims make their way  
 to the town, which is famed as being  
 "the seat of early Christianity in    
 England". Many climb to the ruined    
 tower of St. Michael's church sited at
 the top of the Tor.                   
 The Anglican Pilgrimage, the larger of
 the two, is held on the Saturday after
{St. John the Baptist's}day. During the
 morning the town is quickly filled    
 with coaches which jam the roads. Some
 Pilgrims journey on foot from as far  
 away as Bristol.                      
 In the afternoon there is a large and 
 colourful procession which leads from 
 St.John's Church to the{Abbey Ruins.}A
 service,held in the Abbey grounds is  
 relayed by loudspeakers to the crowds.</content>
