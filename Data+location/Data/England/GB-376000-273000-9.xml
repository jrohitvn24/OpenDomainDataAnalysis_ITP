		<content>   Bewdley was a prosperous town in    
{Georgian}times with many craft        
 industries based on the products of   
 the{Wyre Forest.}Bark Hill used to be 
 where oak bark was stripped and used  
 for{tanning leather.}Charcoal was made
 from Wych Elm.The pine trees were used
 as pit props for the Midland coal     
 mines.{Besoms(or brooms)}barrels ,    
 coracles (a small fishing boat)and    
 horn carving are associated with the  
 Forest.In addition there were other   
 crafts of pewtering, brass            
 foundaries, rope and glove making and 
 glass blowing.{Cap making}dated from  
 Tudor times , and employed a thousand 
 people at one time. The memory of     
 these ancient crafts is kept alive in 
 Bewdley Museum, either in static      
 displays or by craftsmen giving       
 demonstrations of their art.
