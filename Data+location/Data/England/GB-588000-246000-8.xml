		<title>08ACTON/LAVENHAM RAILWAY WALK</title>
		<content>The old railway line (courtesy access) 
and part of Lineage Wood (no public    
access) are managed by Suffolk County  
Council. During construction chalk bed-
rock was exposed and thrown up creating
a mini-downland habitat. Resulting     
flora includes Carline and Dwarf       
Thistles, Bee, Common Purple and Pyra- 
mid Orchids, also Birdsfoot Trefoil, an
important butterfly food plant. All the
common butterflies occur plus Dingy    
Skipper, Holly Blue and Common Blue.   
Scrub provides cover for Whitethroats, 
Swallows and Flycatchers. Magpies, Jays
and Larks visit. The sight is a flight 
line for birds in passage. Grass snakes
lizards and slow-worms occur. Snails   
are plentiful and there are also glow- 
worms. Both enjoy the lime in the soil.
Fallow deer visit from adjoining woods.
There are rabbits and occasional foxes.
