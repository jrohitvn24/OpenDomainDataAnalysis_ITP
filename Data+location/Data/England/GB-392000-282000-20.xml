		<content> About three quarters of the people    
 living in the area are white collar   
 workers and the other quarter do      
 manual jobs.In half of the families   
 both parents work and in the other    
 just men.                             
  Most people work near their homes or 
 in the surrounding area but some      
 people travel round.Full-time workers 
 work 8 to 10 hours a day and part-time
 workers work 3 to 4 hours a day.Most  
 people travel by car.The rest either  
 travel by trains which they catch at  
 Cradley Heath or Lye stations or by   
 bus.In the Cradley area quite a few   
 people are employed in metal-based    
 industries manufacturing nuts,bolts,  
 piping etc.
