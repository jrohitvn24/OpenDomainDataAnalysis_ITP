TO BENEFIT FROM THE MANY AMENITIES. BE-
ING A SMALL TOWN,BUILDING SOCIETIES,DE-
NTISTS,DOCTORS,CHEMISTS,BANKS ARE ALL  
WITHIN EASY REACH.THE LIBRARY AND THEA-
TRE ARE IN A CENTRAL POSITION AND OLD  
TOWN IS PARTICULARLY POPULAR WITH THE  
RETIRED;IT IS A CLOSE-KNIT,FRIENDLY    
COMMUNITY WITH EASY ACCESS TO THE RIVER
,CHURCH AND GARDEN WALKS.ONE INTERVIEWE
WHO HAD ONLY MOVED TO OLD TOWN 2 MONTHS
AGO,ALREADY FELT SHE HAD MADE CLOSE,   
SUPPORTIVE FRIENDS.SHE REMARKED THAT   
FRIENDS AND RELATIVES FOUND IT EASIER  
TO VISIT HER IN A TOWN RATHER THAN IN  
REMOTER AREAS.

AND LUDDINGTON ALSO EXPRESSED GREAT PL-
EASURE AT WHERE THEY LIVED,APPRECIATING
