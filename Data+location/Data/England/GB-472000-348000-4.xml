		<title>04EAST STOKE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{East Stoke}is situated at a crossroads
 on the{Fosse Way,}4 miles SW of       
{Newark.}It is a small village of 135  
 inhabitants which has dwindled from   
 the 450 who were resident there 200   
 years ago. This depopulation is mainly
 due to the now highly mechanised      
 arable farming with the consequent    
 loss of employment. Half the working  
 population still work on the farms,   
 some are self-employed and the rest   
 work in{Newark}or{Nottingham.}        
 There are four tied cottages for farm 
 workers, 2 pensioners' bungalows, and 
 seven council houses.  Some new houses
 are now being built, the first        
 development for many years.
