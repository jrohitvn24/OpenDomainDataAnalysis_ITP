{   Morwellham}was a port in the 19th  
 century for the copper mines of the   
 Tamar Valley.When the mines closed it 
 fell into ruins.In l970 it was opened 
 as an open air Museum which has grown 
 in size ever since.                   
    {Mr Emerson},the manager,told us   
 that there were 3 purposes for the    
 Centre.1)To preserve the port.        
        2)To raise money for this      
 through visitors.                     
        3)To recreate the port as it   
 was in the 19th century.              
                                       
      There are about 130,000 visitors 
 a year.On the busiest days there are  
 about 1800.                           
      The Centre employs 130 people in 
 the summer and 80 in the winter.It is 
 the biggest employer in the area.
