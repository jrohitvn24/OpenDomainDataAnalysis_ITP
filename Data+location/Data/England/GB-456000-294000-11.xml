		<title>11COUNTESTHORPE  - SHOPS</title>
		<content> We think that most shops in           
 Countesthorpe are fairly good.        
 Countesthorpe has got two take-away   
 food shops; one is a normal chipshop  
 and the other is a chinese take-away. 
 We think that this is a good thing to 
 have in Countesthorpe because it saves
 you going to other villages to  get a 
 ready cooked meal.                    
 The other shops we use are the        
 newsagents and the off-licence. We    
 like these shops because they sell    
 sweets,magazines and cards. We also   
 have a bike shop which is cheap.      
 Bikes get repaired on time and they   
 have a wide range of accessories.The  
 post-office is quite good in our eyes 
 but it has been improved with a store 
 next to it which is cheap.
