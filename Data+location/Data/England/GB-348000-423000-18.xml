		<title>18LONGTON CHILDRENS LIFE STYLE</title>
		<content>      The  children of Longton are     
 encouraged to  take  many  extra -    
 curricular activities.  Parents are   
 willing to transport 3 or 4 friends   
 for football games, riding or dancing 
 lessons. Most children try to play a  
 musical instrument, usually beginning 
 at 7 years old with recorder or guitar
 then piano lessons soon afterwards.   
     At home, children keep pets.      
 Unless they are allergic to them      
 almost every child has one kind of    
 animal to look after. Popular pets are
 dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs and  
 budgies. There are quite a few        
 goldfish and, of course, specialists  
 who keep tropical fish tanks or       
 canaries in aviaries.                 
     The schools encourage pupils to   
 look after animals by keeping them at 
 school. During the holidays the pets  
 go to the children's homes.           </content>
