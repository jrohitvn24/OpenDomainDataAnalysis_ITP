		<title>19PERIVALE MATERNITY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> The hospital has about 100 beds and   
 several hundred staff are connected   
 with it.                              
     Various methods of childbirth are 
 used,eg. Le Boyeur's method, active   
 childbirth for which there is a       
 specially made birthday bed. Caesarian
 and vaginal births are both considered
 although the latter is encouraged.    
 Breast feeding is also encouraged in  
 the hospital rather than bottle       
 feeding. Counselling and lessons      
 constituting exercises and advice on  
 labour are given regularly before the 
 birth to the mother to help her decide
 which method would suit her best, and 
 to teach her how to cope with the     
 labour and baby after it is born. High
 technology and low technology birth   
 are both available but the latter,    
 more natural method is encouraged.
