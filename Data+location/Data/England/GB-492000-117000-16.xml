		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN GRAFFHAM</title>
		<content> I.C.I. employ 600 people at Fernhurst,
 &amp; some live in Graffham. They find new
 crop protection products, &amp; develop &amp; 
 market to farmers &amp; gardeners all over
 the world to make sure that they can  
 control insects, pests, weeds &amp;       
 diseases that attack their crops. The 
 farmers in Graffham will buy I.C.I    
 products to control weeds in their    
 fields of corn, to kill insects that  
 might eat the corn, to protect the    
 ears of corn from attack by moulds,   
 rusts &amp; other diseases, &amp; to increase 
 the yields of their crops.  The       
 goverment would not allow a company   
 like I.C.I to sell a product if it was
 dangerous when used as recommended. To
 make sure that the products are safe  
 requires years of testing in          
 laboratories &amp; under field conditions.
