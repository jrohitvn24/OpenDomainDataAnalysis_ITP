		<title>11The School(3)</title>
		<content>The old school buildings, though       
internally changed, are much the same  
externally as in 1865.                 
The old school entrance still boasts   
its bell which once summoned children  
from a wide area locally, the caretaker
attended the school as a boy and talks 
of hearing the bell as he walked from  
Ixworth Thorpe, two miles to the South,
and hoped it would not stop before he  
reached the school or he could be 'in  
for a beating'!                        
                                       
The front of the school, featured in   
one photograph of the village, shows   
the old bell and entrance with the     
church behind. The former was featured 
in external shots for the BBC TV series
'Dad's Army', probably because the     
author, David Croft, is a resident of  
the village in what was once Hall Farm,
but is now Honington Hall.             </content>
