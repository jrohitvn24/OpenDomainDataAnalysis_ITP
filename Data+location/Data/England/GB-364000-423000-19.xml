		<content>      We spend our leisure time in     
 energetic pursuits, such as roller    
 skating and swimming, or we spend it  
 quietly, watching television and      
 playing card and board games. Two     
 popular board games are Monopoly and  
 Scrabble.                             
      Monopoly uses a large board with 
 the names of London Streets around its
 sides. Each player takes turns in     
 moving around the board, buying       
 streets. If another player lands on a 
 street you have bought, he has to pay 
 rent. The object of the game is to get
 as much money as possible.            
      Scrabble uses a board covered by 
 small squares. Each player has 7      
 letters which are used to make up a   
 word. Points are given for each word, 
 more points being given for longer    
 words. The object of the game is to   
 gain more points than anyone else.    </content>
