		<title>03ATTITUDES:ASHLEWORTH</title>
		<content> There is a fair amount of{development 
 going on in Ashleworth which is       
 changing it's role to a commuter      
 village.This is causing concern among 
 the established {population}for two   
 reasons.Firstly,the new housing is all
 very expensive and there is no        
 development suitable for the young    
 local people to buy and consequently  
 they are having to move away.Secondly 
 a lot of the new-comers are not       
 showing much interest in village life 
 which could,in the long run, affect   
 the way of life of the village.The    
 need for change in{attitudes}and      
 growth in Ashleworth is accepted      
 but more interest should be taken by  
 the established population in seeing  
 that it is suitable and more          
 participation in {village life}should 
 be undertaken by the new-comers.
