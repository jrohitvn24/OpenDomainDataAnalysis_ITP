		<content>{Farmers' daily routine }is hard, with 
 little time for leisure;e.g. rise at  
 6.45a.m. and see to the stock and     
 yardwork before a large breakfast of  
 bacon and eggs,toast and marmalade at 
 9; farm work till 1 p.m. lunch, which 
 again is fried or a pie from the      
 oven;tea is at 5.30,taken at table    
 with substantial cold meats, bread and
 butter and cake.In summer work goes on
 till 10p.m. Cooking and heating is    
 chiefly by solid fuel, electricity or 
 oil. All houses get their water from  
 springs or wells, and drainage is to  
 septic tanks. Cats are the commonest  
 pets _ many farms have 4 or 5; dogs,  
 horses and ponies in plenty.Two       
 families keep pet donkeys. No safety  
 precautions exist; all rely on the    
 local fire brigade,except a retired   
 farmer who  has a 3000 gallon tank of 
 water in the barn "just in case".     </content>
