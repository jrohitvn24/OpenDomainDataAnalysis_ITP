		<title>16A MIDDLETON SCHOOLBOY'S DAY</title>
		<content>  I wake up at 7:15 to watch telly.    
 George calls for me at 8:15. We get to
 school at 8:30 and play football until
 9:00. In school we go down to the hall
 to sing hymns. After hymn practice we 
 go to class and do our random number  
 square. Ding, there's the bell. I'll  
 play soccer. Ding, now it's time for  
 maths, last page of graphs is nearly  
 done. Ding, it's dinner time I wonder 
 what's for dinner? Yuck! Mashed       
 potatoes. It's 12:30 and I've just    
 finished my dinner. Outside it's 3-0  
 for us.                               
   Ding, I'll go up to class to get my 
 mark then I'll read a book until the  
 bell rings. Ding, games after break.  
 I'm playing football again. Ding, it's
 games now, I hope it's high jump, I   
 can jump 1.20 Metres but I'll watch   
 for today. Ding, there's the bell. At 
 home I watch T.V. and then go to bed. </content>
