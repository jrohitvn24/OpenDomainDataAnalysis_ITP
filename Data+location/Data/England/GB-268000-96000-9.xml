		<title>09THEMES OF WORK IN SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>   Every term Spreyton School works on 
 a theme but each theme usually        
 connects with the last one.           
   When we were studying the{Mary Rose}
 we visited her at Portsmouth and also 
 worked on a simulation computer       
 program.We found out that Mary Rose   
 capsized because of a strong wind and 
 this led us to the next theme which   
 was{The Weather.}After the weather we}
 did {The Sun}because the sun has a    
 great effect on the weather and the   
 next theme was{The Planets.}We visited
 the planetarium at Plymouth to look at
 some of the constellations and we also
 camped out under the stars at our     
 teacher's place.We did not actually   
 see many stars because it was cloudy  
 but we did see bats, owls,moths and   
 flying,creepy crawlies which led us in
 to our next theme called {Flight.}
