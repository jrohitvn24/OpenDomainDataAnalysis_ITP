		<title>07Frocester Estate Barn.</title>
		<content>  When we visited the Owner was slowly 
 re-roofing the house,with the Stone   
 Tiles.He told us he had re-roofed the 
 Barn over several years.              
  The Great Tithe or Estate Barn dates 
 from 1280-1285 &amp; is one of the largest
 in the country.It is built of local   
 Limestone with a stone tile roof &amp; is 
 186'long x 30'wide.The well buttressed
 walls are 12' to the eaves and it is  
 36'to the roof ridge.The timbers are  
 massive,mostly of Oak and Elm with the
 addition of Deal put in during repair.
 The original roof was destroyed by    
 fire in the early 16th.century but was
 probably replaced to the old pattern. 
 It was interesting to see the massive 
 building still being used for farming 
 purposes.The nearby buildings are C16-
 C19th.and have been adapted to present
 needs and are linked with modern farm 
 structures,so using old and new.      </content>
