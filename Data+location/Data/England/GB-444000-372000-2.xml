   This year 1985 has just seen the end
 of a year long miners{Strike.}It      
 started in March 1984 and finished    
 almost exactly a year later. The      
 strike started because{Mr. Ian        
{MacGregor}wished to close down some of
 the pits. Since then some people have 
 been injured in disturbances.         
   Today the average miner gets Â£95 a  
 week. Unfortunately the outlook in our
 coalfield is not very promising.      
 Recently there has been speculation   
 that some pits may have to close.     
  {Markham Colliery}is the biggest pit 
 in our area and there is another pit  
 at Stanfree. The clearest evidence of 
 mining in the area is the huge slurry 
 tips of mine waste that have now been 
 grassed over in part. Several of these
 tips can be seen in the area.
