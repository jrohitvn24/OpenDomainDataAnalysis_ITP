		<title>05Horses in Knockholt</title>
		<content> Many people in Knockholt own their own
 horses and ponies, which are mainly   
 used for their own pleasure. A lot of 
 children go to the local Pony Club    
 events, the nearest is at Sevenoaks.  
 There are two local riding stables,   
 one has horses at livery.             
 The Mountross Shetland Pony Stud was  
 started in 1969 by Mrs Brenda Holly   
 whose Shetland Ponies are the smallest
 breed in the British Isles being only 
 28 to 38 inches in height. Though they
 are the smallest breed of ponies they 
 are very hardy and live out all year  
 even in the hardest conditions. Many  
 of Mrs Holly's foals are exported to  
 the United States of America, Holland 
 and Germany to be used for showing and
 breeding.
