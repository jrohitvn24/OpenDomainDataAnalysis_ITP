		<title>08THE FERRY AT HAMPTON LOADE 1</title>
		<content> The ferry goes backwards and forwards 
 across the River Severn at Hampton    
 Loade.It has been doing this for      
 twenty years.There were other ferries 
 before this one.The ferry was made of 
 wood from one big larch tree from the 
 Dudmaston Estate.The two ladies who   
 work the ferry are Mrs.Evans and      
 Mrs.James.These two sisters have      
 worked on this ferry since it was     
 built.                                
     When the river is at its highest  
 the ferry has been known to float on  
 top of the bank.It stays up there for 
 two days then it goes down with the   
 river.When the river goes down it     
 leaves a lot of sand and mud on the   
 bank and landing stages and makes a   
 lot of work sweeping it off.          
     The ferry goes across the river   
 diagonally.It is helped across by     
 three wires and a pulley.             </content>
