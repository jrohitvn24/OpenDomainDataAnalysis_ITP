 Bear street cemetery is next to the   
 allotments.It had two chapels which   
 used to be used for two religions of  
 the same kind.                        
           The Graves are usually dug  
 to about 5 to 6 feet.The N.D.D.C owns 
 the Cemetery.It has been opened since 
 1860.A graveyard is attatched to a    
 Church but a cemetery is not.
