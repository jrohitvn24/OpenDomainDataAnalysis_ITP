		<content> Housing survey: General summary.      
    This area is a very popular suburb 
 of the city of Hull.The majority of   
 houses are privately owned and the    
 area contains a wide choice in the    
 size , style and price of houses .    
  There are a number of large Georgian 
 and Victorian houses, some old        
 cottages now renovated but most of the
 houses are traditional "semis" built  
 just before and just after the 1939-45
 war.In the last ten years several new 
 private developments have been started
 in this area and are continuing.      
   Even the terraced houses are not of 
 the traditional type.They are built in
 blocks of eight with gardens  and     
 garage access.House prices varied from
 Â£25000 for a terraced house to Â£175000
 for a 7 bedroomed, detached house     
 standing in 4 acres of land.
