		<title>10The Blackdown Hills Mission</title>
		<content> Strangers were unwelcome on the Hills 
 noted for superstition, coining,      
 smuggling,sheepstealing and poaching. 
 In 1863 George Brealey, supported by  
 Quaker families from Wellington, was  
 moved to start prayer meetings in his 
 cottage at Rosemary Lane, Clayhidon.  
 So many people came to his preaching  
 he made a gallery,removing the        
 ceilings.He baptised in the River     
 Culm. He prayed for money and land to 
 open the Blackdown Hills Mission 1865,
 beside his cottage. His son Walter and
 wife opened a school;he helped 130    
 people to emigrate to new lives.By    
 1900 there were 6 mission rooms, 4    
 Sunday 3-day schools,clubs,a library. 
 At one time Brealey thought of leaving
 to preach to the'Blacks'.An old lady  
 begged"No!No!Master, we be blacks     
 -we've got black hearts.God sent you  
 to us."The mission flourishes today.  </content>
