		<content> A nightly curfew has been rung        
 voluntarily from the Church Tower     
 since Norman times. It is rung from   
 September to March except on Sunday   
 nights. Few people help now. Unusual  
 lead miners' Christmas carols have    
 been sung each December for over a    
 hundred years.They are sung in church 
 or chapel and in the George Hotel.    
 Fewer people sing them nowadays.An    
 August gymkhana is held for pony      
 events.For the last 15 Years there's  
 been a Church Festival of Art and     
 Craft,done by the villagers.It        
 attracts 6,000 people annually.Each   
 year since 1970 many illuminated      
 Christmas trees are erected in the    
 village.In 1984 there were 65         
 trees.Each August is Sports Family    
 Day.Each November is bonfire night    
 with a firework display.For both the  
 last 2 events,admission is free.      </content>
