		<content>{The Horse and Jockey}is on the A435   
 to Alcester.Weekday customers are     
 mainly businessmen and local farmers. 
 Weekend customers are families from   
 other areas.Serving food increases    
 trade so barbeques, discos and a      
 garden are added attractions.         
{The Coach &amp; Horses}lies at the foot of
 Weatheroak Hill where Ryknild St.Roman
 Road crosses the road to Alvechurch.  
 I studied the barrels behind the bar. 
 There were many kinds of beer. I      
 thought the bar was strange because   
 the glasses were hung over the bar.   
{The Peacock}is at the top of          
 Weatheroak Hill where Ryknild Street  
 joins the Birmingham Boundary.The     
 regular customers are from local      
 farms amd houses.The bar was a little 
 place at the back of the lounge.It has
 a garden, which is very popular in    
 summer.   {SILVERMEAD.}               </content>
