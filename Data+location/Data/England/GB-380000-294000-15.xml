		<title>15SHOPPING IN THE SEISDON AREA</title>
		<content>   The only shop in this block is the  
Post Office/general stores situated in 
Seisdon, just inside the south-east    
corner of the area.   Shopping presents
quite a problem for some of the        
inhabitants, especially those who do   
not live near the bus route or own a   
car.                                   
   For those who are able to travel,   
Wolverhampton is usually the main      
shopping centre visited but some prefer
the quieter atmosphere of Bridgnorth   
and the markets there on Fridays and   
Saturdays are very popular.            
   There are some mobile shops which   
visit the district and provide a real  
service for more isolated customers.   
   There are several farm shops and    
other local people sell their produce  
from home on a seasonal basis but      
probably townspeople from Wolverhampton
are the principal customers here.      </content>
