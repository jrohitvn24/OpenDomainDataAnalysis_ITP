 St. James's Church stands on the      
 eastern edge of Thornton village. It  
 was opened in 1872. The bell tower is 
 about 150 feet or 50 metres high. The 
 church is big enough to seat about    
 500 people. In the church are the bell
 and stone font from the old bell      
 chapel. The altar is below the east   
 facing window so that the sun shines  
 through in the mornings. The remains  
 of the old bell chapel stand across   
 the road. It was here that the father 
 of the famous Bronte children preached
 in the nineteenth century. Some Bronte
 relics can be found in St James's     
 church today.
