		<title>16OWER FARM RACING STABLES</title>
		<content>    The Stables were opened in the     
 early 1930's. In those days over fifty
 prime horses were trained there, but  
 during the second world war the place 
 had to be partially closed down, and  
 it never returned to its full         
 capacity.                             
    There are twenty race horses there 
 now. They are exercised in three      
 strings every day, there being enough 
 staff to ride each horse over         
 Corhampton Downs.                     
    The horses are raced at Courses    
 such as Salisbury, Lingfield, Warwick 
 and Newbury.                          
    Each horse has its own stable and  
 its own lad, who grooms and mucks it  
 out and sees to its feed. The owner of
 the racing stables inspects the horses
 each morning and night as well as     
 keeping a careful eye on their        
 training and general wellbeing.       </content>
