		<content>   The Fire Station is on the edge of  
 the town next to the Police station   
 and the Ambulance services. There are 
 7 men to each watch (4 to go on the   
 engine, 2 to stay at the base         
 and 1 extra) and the 4 watches        
 work in pairs,12 hours at a time, to  
 cover the day. There are no major fire
 hazards that could cause large        
 explosions in Rickmansworth itself.   
 Most bad fires to which they are      
 called are in Watford, within the     
 7 mile radius which is their area.They
 are called to c.2-4 real fires a week;
 but there are many false alarms which 
 they dare not ignore just in case.They
 are also called to accidents. It takes
 c. 30 seconds to get to the engine    
 from the bell (they slide down the    
 pole) and they have to be able to     
 carry a 12 stone man 200 yards in a   
 minute.They train on a false tower.   </content>
