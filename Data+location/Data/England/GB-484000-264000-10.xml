		<title>10 Rural Policeman in Wilby</title>
		<content> In the autumn the farmers in this area
burn the stubble of their crops and    
before starting the policeman has to be
informed so that he can see that all   
the safety rules for containing the    
fires have been obeyed.                
 The rural policeman checks that       
licences have been obtained for any    
guns used in his area either for       
containing vermin or shooting for      
sport.  He also ensures that the       
Protection of Birds Act is upheld and  
that no cruel sports such as badger    
baiting, dog fighting or cock fighting 
are performed. Poaching and cattle     
rustling where the animals can be      
killed and sold as meat or taken alive 
&amp; sold are sometimes problems he has to
deal with. The rural policeman tries to
be involved in all village activities &amp;
gives protection &amp; help to the isolated
farms.                                 </content>
