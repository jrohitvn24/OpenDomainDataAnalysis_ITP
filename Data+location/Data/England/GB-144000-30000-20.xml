		<title>20A SCHOOL DAY AT HEAMOOR.</title>
		<content>  At 8.45a.m.I go to the bathroom to   
 wash my face.I get dressed and have my
 breakfast in the kitchen.I pack my    
 lunch and leave for school.I don't    
 walk far but it seems a long way when 
 it is hot.I arrive at 9a.m.,put my    
 homework in my desk and go to my seat.
 We have prayers each day except       
 Monday. Sometimes I do S.M.P. Maths so
 I fetch my book.After break,which is  
 from 10.30a.m.to 10.50a.m.,I do       
 English and reading. Lunch is from    
 12.00 to1.30p.m.when I sometimes go to
 recorder club.                        
  After lunch we paint or do work on   
 our term's project.Afternoon break is 
 from 2.35p.m.to 2.55p.m. At the end of
 the day we listen to a short story and
 stack our chairs.                     
  If there is not a club after school I
 go home, eat tea and go to the        
 swimming club at the indoor pool.     </content>
