		<content>  Easton, so called because of its     
 lying{east of Hingham,}which was the  
 most important town in the area at one
 time, was owned by the manor of       
 Costessey,{the Stafford family.       
                                       
  This was written about Easton:       
 "This village is observed for its     
 producing a man,{Adam de Easton}who   
 was a{roman cardinal.}Adam de Easton  
 was a benedictine monk in Norwich and 
 a man of great wisdom and learning.   
                                       
  In{1381}he was made the Cardinal,    
{Dean of York}and because of this, his 
 home of Easton became of new          
 importance as did the benedictine     
 abbey attached to Norwich cathedral.  
 In spite of him being involved in a   
{plot against the Pope Urban in 1385}he
 was saved by powerful English         
 influence.                            </content>
