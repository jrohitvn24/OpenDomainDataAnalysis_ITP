		<title>14CHURCH HISTORY AND LEGEND</title>
		<content> In  All  Saints  Church  chancel  is a
 stone  statue  of  a  knight.   He  is
 William  De  Marmion  who died in 1270
 and  whose  family  were  Lords of the
 Manor  of Winteringham from 1166_1325.
 He is dressed in chain  armour  with a
 shield. His feet are resting on a lion
 and his head is guarded by two angels.
 Behind the font  is  a  stained  glass
 window  in  memory of Henry Kirk_White
 a  famous  Nottinghamshire  poet   and
 pupil  at  the  vicarage  from 1804_5.
 Local legend says that whilst crossing
 the river his boat became  stuck  on a
 mud bank. It was then  that  he  wrote
 the words of the famous  hymn  "Oft in
 danger,  oft  in  woe".    The  church
 shares a vicar with three neighbouring
 villages. A Communion  service is held
 each Sunday at  9am  and  Evensong  is
 held every third Sunday in the month.
