		<content> Tatworth School provides primary      
 education for children aged between   
 four and eleven years. The school     
 celebrated its centenary in 1979 and  
 is still housed in the original       
 buildings.                            
                                       
 The number of children has fluctuated 
 dramatically during the school's      
 history - in 1985 it has 170 in six   
 classes, though numbers are dropping  
 in common with schools all over the   
 country (due to a drop in the birth   
 rate).                                
                                       
 Most children live in Tatworth and    
 South Chard, with a small number      
 coming from outside the village.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
