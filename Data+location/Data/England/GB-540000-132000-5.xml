 ,spacious and detached building.It has
 several wings to it and it also has   
 two floors to it.These are designed

 books.It also has a very large        
 catchment area:350 square miles.      
  There is only one chemist in the     
 village,but Miss Millington(DR.Hardy's
 secretary)said that this is           
 adequate.                             
  There are several chemists in near by
