		<content> Many homes with spare rooms welcome   
 families with rather less money to lay
 out on touring, and the owners provide
 a nights rest and cooked breakfast for
 people in transit, or for those who   
 prefer to be out all day with picnic  
 or bar lunches on their way. Some land
 ladies even provide the packed lunch  
 and fill thermosflasks for the trip.  
 High Mill and Barker Knott are two of 
 the established farms who render this 
 successful service. Not so many in    
 this valley, Bellman Ground is a good 
 example, and gives privacy and quiet  
 too, since the road to the house is a 
 track and not a through route. The    
 cottages are well appointed but not   
 too luxurious. Ash cottage is rented  
 out by the Cumbria Trust Housing      
 Authority, a new idea. This scheme is 
 developing rapidly in the Lakes.
