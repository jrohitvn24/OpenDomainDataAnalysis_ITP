		<title>12Holidays</title>
		<content>  We had a look at the holiday that    
 people in our class had during the    
 last twelve months. Five didn't go    
 away for a holiday;five went abroad,  
 mainly Spain.                         
  Of the 21 holidays taken in the      
 United kingdom, Dorset and Wales were 
 most popular. The choice of Wales     
 being higher because four scouts      
 camped there. Half the holidays were  
 camping or staying in a caravan and a 
 fifth stayed with friends. Only three 
 stayed at a hotel. Apart from the     
 scouts nearly all the others went on  
 holiday  with their family. Most      
 travelled by car, four went by plane, 
 none by train. Two thirds of the      
 holidays were for one week or less.   
  The 1985 scout camp was in Wales. We 
 mostly went canoeing but we also went 
 pony trecking and hiking. We had camp 
 fires where we told jokes and stories.</content>
