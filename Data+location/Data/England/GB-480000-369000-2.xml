		<content> As one might expect,one of the main   
 occupations of the block is           
 farming.There eight farmers within the
 grid who are mostly involved with     
 mixed farming.Cattle are mostly reared
 for beef and include such breeds as   
 Hereford X,Charolais X,and Murray     
 Blue.Sheep include Suffolk and        
 Mules.One farmer concentrates solely  
 on sheep.Crops grown include sugar    
 beet,barley,wheat,potatoes,carrots and
 oil seed rape.The farmers all attend  
 Newark Cattle Market which is held on 
 a Wednesday,for the buying and selling
 of cattle.Sheep are sent futher afield
 to Berwick on Tweed,Yorkshire and     
 Derbyshire.All the farmers work at    
 least ten hours a day but manage to   
 have time off at the weekend.Apart    
 from one they all have an annual      
 holiday in late May or early between  
 the sowing and harvesting seasons.    </content>
