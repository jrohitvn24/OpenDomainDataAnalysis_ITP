		<content> This area, with only eight dwellings, 
 is downland and apart from Upwaltham  
 Estate and Selhurst Park Farm it is   
 densely wooded.                       
 The timber is mixed.  Conifers are    
 present in the Forestry Commision     
 areas, but there is a geat deal of    
 beech, ash and sycamore with little   
 oak.  The woodland is cared for, and  
 populated by all kinds of wildlife,   
 including deer.  There are many foxes,
 and one has been a particular nuisance
 at Upwaltham Estate but we heard no   
 news of badgers. They may be present  
 however.  The A285 is the main        
 Chichester - Petworth road.  The road 
 running from Benges Cottages to       
 Goodwood race track is narrow while   
 the Upwaltham to East Dean road is a  
 single track with passing places.     
                                       
                                       </content>
