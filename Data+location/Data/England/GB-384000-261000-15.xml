 where the date{1876}is engraved. There
 are{two classes}at the moment. Mrs    
 Clark teaches the 4-6 year olds and Mr
 Finn teaches the 7-9 year olds.In     
 September 1985 there will be{49       
{children,}which means we will have    
 another teacher, Mrs Nixon, who       
 will work in the mornings. Mrs Scott  
 is our secretary and ancillary helper.
 She works four mornings and on Mondays
 takes a group for cookery. Mrs
