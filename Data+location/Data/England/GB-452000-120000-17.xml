		<title>17MANOR HOUSES IN UPHAM</title>
		<content>           UPHAM HOUSE                 
    Upham House is the most central of 
 three large houses standing in a      
 commanding position at the point where
 the mediaeval road left Upham to      
 descend to Waltham.The estate was     
 passed down from generation to        
 generation until 1921, when it was    
 broken up and the farms of Newlyn,    
 Bigpath and Ower sold.                
           WINTERSHILL HALL            
    It is believed that a community of 
 Jutes first worked Wintershill on a   
 three-fold system of cultivation      
 before the Norman Conquest.           
    In 1464 there were about 300 acres 
 of land, much of which was used for   
 hunting.When King John went on a hunt 
 there it lasted 27 days,and the King  
 was accompanied by his greyhound      
 keeper with war horses, brachet       
 hounds, greyhounds and terriers.      </content>
