		<title>12Old People in Wootton</title>
		<content>      We interviewed a retired district
 nurse  who  now  does a great deal for
 old  people.  An Old Folks' Club meets
 once  a fortnight.  On Wednesday there
 is a whist afternoon in the Old Folks'
 room   and   a  social   afternoon  on
 Thursdays.  Twice  a  week  there is a
 luncheon  club  for  25 to 30  people.
 Two  courses and coffee are served for
 60p.   About  twelve  people  in   the
 village receive{meals-on-wheels.}These
 are cooked  in  Marcham Primary School
 and delivered by volunteer drivers.  A
 team  of  volunteer  drivers also take
 old  people  to hospital appointments.
 A  special church service is held once
 a  month  in  the  Old Folks' room for
 people  who  do  not  want  to come to
 church.  A {mobile library}calls fort-
 nightly.   The   British  Legion  also
 cares for the old people.  They give a
 Â£5 voucher to the old and visit them. </content>
