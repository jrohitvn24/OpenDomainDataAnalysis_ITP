		<content> "Higher Hurdsfield seems to have no   
 real centre". This may be the view of 
 those who see only a main road with   
 houses on either side and little else,
 but there are items of interest.A     
 little lane leads to Lower Fold Farm, 
 an attractive building said to contain
 the oldest room in this part of       
 Macclesfield. Until recently two of   
 its windows were bricked up because of
 the old "Window Tax" laws, but these  
 have been reopened. Here too we can   
 see the skill of the craftsman in the 
 handmade furniture of beautiful       
 traditional design which has been     
 produced by the present occupant. Old 
 and new are blended together with     
 great skill.Outside a small building  
 at the top of Rainow Road a notice    
 board says "Higher Hurdsfield         
 Community Centre and Sunday School."It
 is still used as a Sunday School &amp; W.I</content>
