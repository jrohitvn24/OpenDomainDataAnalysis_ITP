		<title>13CHILDREN IN STAMBOURNE</title>
		<content>  The only organisations exclusively   
 for children and young people are the 
 Sunday School and the Lions football  
 club. Children and young people are   
 members of the Stambourne Players, the
 Women's Institute and the dog club.   
  Children travel for other activities:
 Brownie Guides in Toppesfield and     
 Guides in Yeldham, Cubs, Scouts and   
 Venture Scouts in Ridgewell or        
 Finchingfield. Teenagers attend Youth 
 Clubs in Finchingfield and Haverhill. 
 Hedingham Junior Music School provides
 music tuition and school pupils take  
 part in after- school activities eg   
 drama and music productions and sport.
  There is no public transport to take 
 them to any of these activities, so   
 parents have to transport their       
 children by car. Car-sharing is       
 extensive.
