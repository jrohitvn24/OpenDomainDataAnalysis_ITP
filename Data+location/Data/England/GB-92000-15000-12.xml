		<title>12HELICOPTER TO ST.MARTINS IOS</title>
		<content>    1985 is an important year for the  
 St.Martin's flower farmers,because    
 this year has brought the British     
 Airways Helicopter here regularly for 
 the first time.Approximately 8000     
 flower boxes have been exported direct
 from St.Martins,to reach the markets  
 sooner than before and in better      
 condition through less handling of the
 boxes.                                
   The helicopter swooped over us like 
 a large eagle,then glided in like a   
 cloud,but by no means as quiet as a   
 cloud.Then the tractors came onto the 
 scene,the co-pilot helped the loader  
 and farmers to load the boxes.The last
 flowers were loaded;the helicopter    
 took along time to take off with the  
 extra weight,but when it did it       
 swooped right over my head.When all   
 the tractors had gone it looked as if 
 nothing had happened.                 </content>
