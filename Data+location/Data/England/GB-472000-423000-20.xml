  In 1085 when William the Conqueror's 
 first Domesday Book was produced,     
 relatively few people were actually   
 involved in its compilation, although 
 many thousands of people had to be    
 consulted. So it is with the 1986     
 version.                              
  This block for the Goole area has    
 been surveyed by five of the local    
 schools, involving many children aged 
 8 to 13 and staff. Those involved     
 were:                                 
                                       
       Bartholomew Middle School       
       Boothferry Middle School        
       Pasture Road First School       
       Parkside First School           
       St.Joseph's R.C.Primary School  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
