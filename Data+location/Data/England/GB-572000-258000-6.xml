		<content> Most households with the exception of 
 the elderly own at least one car, many
 having 2. The 16-17 year olds have    
 mopeds and small motorcycles and as   
 soon as they are old enough at 17 the 
 majority learn to drive cars. As the  
 nearest towns are between 8 adn 10    
 miles away, people need their own     
 transport for getting to and from     
 work, and for pleasure. If you want to
 go any distance of an evening, a car  
 is essential. There is a very limited 
 bus service which serves the centre of
 the village from Newmarket and Bury St
 Edmunds can be reached. As there is no
 school all the children are           
 transported by school buses or cars.  
 Some people are very concerned at the 
 lack of speed limits and of dangerous 
 parking. There are a lot of public    
 footpaths across private land, but    
 very few use them these days.         </content>
