		<title>07Policing New Milton and area</title>
		<content> In our D-block we have 4 or 5 police  
 on duty.Each policeman has a helmet,a 
 truncheon and a radio.There are about 
 1400 crimes a year.Quite a lot of     
 money is spent on petrol.The bills get
 sent to headquarters.In our main      
 police station that controls New      
 Milton there are three main cells and 
 one is for women.Sometimes prisoners  
 escape but are soon caught.More people
 get killed in car accidents than by   
 violence.Most murders in our area are 
 caused by domestic quarrels.More young
 people are involved in crime than     
 adults.The best make for police cars  
 are Volvo's.In the cars they have     
 breathalisers,spotlights,extinguisher,
 handcuffs,seat-belt cutter,tyre       
 tester,torches,radio,signs,shovel,    
 brush,orange jacket and tape measures.
