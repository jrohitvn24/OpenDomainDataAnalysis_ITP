		<title>09LIFESTYLES IN TOFTWOOD</title>
		<content> We decided to carry out a survey to   
 try and find out more about how people
 lived in our area. To do this we      
 compiled a questionnaire and then     
 visited one house on each street in   
 order to make our sample              
 representative. The area we surveyed  
 is really a collection of housing     
 developments which were built in the  
 late 1960s and 1970s. Bungalows       
 outnumber houses 2:1 in this area     
 nearly all of the buildings had       
 central heating. Most of the people   
 living in Toftwood are either retired 
 people or young married families. It  
 seems that one of the reasons people  
 like to live here is because the price
 of housing is quite cheap compared to 
 the centre of Dereham or Norwich which
 is only 16 miles away. The people with
 children liked it because it was safe 
 and there were schools nearby.        </content>
