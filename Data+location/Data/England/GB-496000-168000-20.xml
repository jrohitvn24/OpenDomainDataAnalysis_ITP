		<title>20GAMES IN THE PLAYGROUND</title>
		<content> There are lots of games played by     
 children in our school,such as off_   
 ground-touch,Tally-ho,football and    
 chain-he.Chain-he is played by four or
 more people.One person is it and gives
 the others 50 to get away.when one    
 person is caught he chains up with    
 that person.He/she can either chain by
 means of a scarf,or by holding hands. 
 This game can go on for over two      
 hours,according to the amount of      
 people playing. When there are more   
 than four  people chaining together   
 you have to make two sets of two's    
 chasing the rest.When everyone has    
 been caught we start a new game.This  
 game is played mostly in winter but   
 occasionly played in the summer, when 
 it is not too hot.On hot days we      
 either walk around the field or sit on
 the playground talking.
