		<content>  The overall impression given by the  
 grid area,is that of a sleepy,        
 comfortable,rural part of             
 Worcestershire,subject to few,if any, 
 of the extremes of wealth or poverty. 
  17 farms are named,which specialise  
 in arable, livestock or soft fruit    
 growing,with areas of both natural    
 deciduous and some planted coniferous 
 woodland.The fields still have hedge  
 boundaries with few stone walls or    
 wooden fences.                        
  As car ownership has increased in    
 recent years,the largest of the 15    
 settlements have become dormatory     
 villages for families working or going
 to school in Worcester or Malvern.    
  44 children from the area travel by  
 bus or car to attend Dyson Perrins CE 
 High School, which is to the SW of the
 area. Another 15 will be starting in  
 September 1985.                       </content>
