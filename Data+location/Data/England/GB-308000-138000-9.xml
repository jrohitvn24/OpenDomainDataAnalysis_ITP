		<content>      The{Sampford Brett Players}are a 
 group of amateur actors and           
 actresses. They usually put on a{play 
{twice a year.}The plays are three act 
 plays. They borrow a written script   
 from Glastonbury then act it out. If  
 they put on a play in{April}they      
 usually start to rehearse in{January. 
{They have up to 20}rehearsals two     
 nights a week.                        
      They have to{build}their own     
{stage and scenery .}They have no      
 curtains, because there is nowhere to 
 hang them.So each time they change    
 scenery it is done in almost complete 
 darkness.The village hall can hold up 
 to eighty people.Each play is put on  
 for three nights a Thursday, Friday   
 and Saturday. Each time there is a    
 costume play they{make all the clothes
 themselves.There are dressing rooms   
 at the back of the hall.              </content>
