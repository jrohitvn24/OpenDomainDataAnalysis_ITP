		<content>   The area covered by our survey is   
 divided by{The Manchester Ship Canal  
 (and{The River Mersey})running from   
 the S.W. to the N.E.. It is also cut  
 through from N. to S. by the{M6       
{Motorway}and its notorious{Thelwall   
{Viaduct.                              
                                       
  There are three large sectors of     
 housing; Woolston in the N., Statham  
 in the S.E., and Thelwall in the S.W..
                                       
   The Woolston area might best be     
 called working class while the two    
 areas in the south could be seen as   
 middle or upper working class.        
                                       
   The land in between is most unusual.
 Known as the{The Eyes,}it is desolate 
 and occupied only by birds and other  
 wildlife.                             
                                       </content>
