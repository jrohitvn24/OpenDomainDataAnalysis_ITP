		<title>03W.CHILTINGTON HOBJON'S COTT.</title>
		<content>{  Hobjon's}was built in the 1600's. We
 think it was called Hobjon's because  
 Hob means 'old'-{Old Jon's Cottage.   
   The roof used to be thatched but it 
 is now slate and stone. Today's lounge
 used to be a kitchen and washroom. The
 low ceiling was beamed and there was a
 hook to hang their pig on, and a hole 
 in the floor so the pig's head could  
 fit. The beams were made from{chestnut
 because the trees grew taller than{oak
   In the dining room they had an      
 enormous{inglenook fireplace.}Salt was
 stored in a little cupboard to keep it
 dry and bacon smoked on a chimney     
 shelf.                                
   The {King Post}held up the roof     
 going all the way up the house. In the
 17th century{Thomas Slater}lived here.
 He built the{stocks}by the church.    
{Slaters}still live in{Hobjon's}and are
 builders and slaters by trade.        </content>
