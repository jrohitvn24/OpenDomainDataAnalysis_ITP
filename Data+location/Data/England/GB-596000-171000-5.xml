		<content>   The{entertainment}in Eastchurch is  
 centred around the Village{Hall,}     
 Working Men's Club and the Pubs.      
   The village hall was built after    
 World War 2 with money raised by the  
 villagers. The committee which runs   
 the hall organise weekly whist drives,
 bingo and a social{club}for the       
 disabled. The hall is also used for   
 private functions. All the activities 
 are well supported by the local       
 community.                            
   The working men's club offers       
 snooker, billiards, a bar and a weekly
 disco. At Christmas a children's party
 is organised.                         
   The local{pubs}provide another form 
 of entertainment. They are used by the
 local people and by the influx of     
 holidaymakers during the summer.      
   The village holds a popular, annual 
 carnival.                             </content>
