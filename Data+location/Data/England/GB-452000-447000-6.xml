		<title>06A Vet in 1985</title>
		<content> Today in 1985 vets have a very hard   
 life.They are on call for twenty-four 
 hours a day to treat animals.Today    
 they are called to people's houses    
 more than they work at a surgery.     
 Some of the equipment they use are    
 stethoscopes,stitching wire,syringes  
 and medicines. Nowadays vets need more
 qualifications than even a doctor.They
 have to get four or five A levels to  
 get into a veterinary college. They   
 spend five years training. They have  
 lectures about caring for animals.    
 Vets have to be fairly fit.It's just  
 as well because my dad is a vet and   
 once a pig chased him and he had to   
 jump over a wall to escape. Everyone  
 calls vets,vets but their real name is
 veterinary surgeon.
