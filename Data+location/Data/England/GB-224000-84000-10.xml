		<title>10FARMING IN EGLOSKERRY (5).</title>
		<content>{ FARM MACHINERY.}                     
 Every farm had some kind of machinery.
 Every farm had at least one{tractor   
 and one farm had eight tractors. The  
 17 farms had 61 tractors between them,
 an average of between three and       
 four each. Every single farm had at   
 least one{grass cutter}and many farms 
 had two grass cutters.One even had    
 three. Every farm except one had a    
{fore-end loader}and a{roller.}Thirteen
 farms had a{buckrake}and two out of   
 the thirteen kept two buckrakes. There
 were thirteen farms that kept{harrows,
 the number of harrows altogether being
 twenty-one.Twelve farms kept{crop     
{sprayers,}all having one each. Nine   
 farms had{combine harvesters.}We      
 imagine that the farmers who didn't   
 have one borrowed the other farmer's  
 combines, or hired a contractor.
