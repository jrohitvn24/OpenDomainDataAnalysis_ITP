		<title>04GAMES AT KINGSWOOD SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  These are some of the games we play  
 in the school playground: football,   
 netball, skipping, sevens, conkers,   
 piggy-in-the-middle, kiss-chase, dinky
 cars, hop-scotch, stepping-stones,    
 ABC, ring-a-roses, tag, volleyball and
 round-the-snail. Some of these games  
 use lines that have been painted on   
 the playground. One of these is ABC:  
 this game uses an alphabet painted on 
 our playground. If you have a coin,   
 you toss it into the air and call     
 "Heads" or "Tails". If you call right 
 you can move on a letter: the first   
 one to Z wins. At playtimes, we       
 practice netball so that we are good  
 when we play matches. We have to throw
 the ball into the net which is 2.5    
 metres from the ground. In autumn we  
 play conkers. You play by having a    
 conker on a piece of string and trying
 to shatter other people's conkers.    </content>
