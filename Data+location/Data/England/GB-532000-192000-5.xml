		<title>05HEALTH AND FITNESS</title>
		<content> In Britain today there are loads and  
 loads of health fanatics who have been
 influenced by the Americans. When you 
 walk down Church Street you see       
 joggers,cyclists and even people      
 walking to keep fit. I do all these   
 activities but somehow never seem to  
 be any healthier. This is probably due
 to the many varieties of foods        
 containing fat. They may be           
 cakes,chips (or anything fried in fat)
 .You think of fat as a really         
 disgusting  thing but when you are    
 sitting down with you feet up eating a
 fresh cream chocolate eclair you don't
 think of it then.                     
 Many people are turning vegetarian.   
 This is a popular health trend.       
 Vegetarians live on                   
 fruit,nuts,vegetables and wholemeal   
 bread.Idon't think Icould survive     
 without having meat,cakes or chips.   </content>
