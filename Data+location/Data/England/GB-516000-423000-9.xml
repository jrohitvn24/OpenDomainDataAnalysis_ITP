 The largest war relic in our area is  
{Paull Battery}.This is a kind of fort 
 which was built during the First World
 War for the soldiers.There were a     
 great many soldiers billeted at the   
 fort and they came to Paull by        
 ship.There are the remains of the     
 jetties all along the shore used by   
 ships such as HMS Anson to embark the 
 men.The fort was used in the Second   
 World War too as a gun battery and    
 there are the remains of the weapon   
 pits and gun mounts all along the     
 shore.There are a great many tunnels  
 in the battery running all in         
 different directions.                 
  All alonf the river bank are the     
 remains of pits which were to look    
 like a fake port so that when the     
 Nazis came to bomb Hull they would    
 bomb the shore instead.               </content>
