		<title>01EAST HADDON A GENERAL VIEW.</title>
		<content>East Haddon is a small rural village   
situated 8 miles from Northampton,11   
miles from Rugby and 15 miles from     
Market Harborough.Mentioned in the     
original Domesday survey the village   
had grown slowly until the twentieth   
century. This has seen a major change  
and the size of the village has        
doubled. There have been a number of   
council houses built together with 4   
small private estates. The population  
today is largely professional with a   
disproportionate number being involved 
in education.The majority of older     
buildings are of local sandstone a soft
and unsuitable building material.Modern
buildings are either from reconstituted
stone blocks or pale brick.Future      
development is limited by the          
inadequacy of the village sewers.
