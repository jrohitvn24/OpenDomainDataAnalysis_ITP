		<content>  In 1921 the parishes of Fawley and   
 Dibden together had a population of   
 4085,but the establishment of an oil  
 refinery at Fawley in 1920 brought    
 about an increase in house building   
 which gained momentum after the       
 refinery expansion in 1951. Inter-war 
 housing development in Blackfield was 
 linear and rather untidy,followed in  
 the post-war era by in filling. In    
 1951 the New Forest Rural District    
 Council built 201 houses near         
 Blackfield. Improvements to the main  
 drainage system in the 70's made      
 further development possible but this 
 was due to the proximity to           
 Southampton rather than the refinery  
 at Fawley. Future development now     
 looks limited due to lack of suitable 
 infilling sites,extraction of gravel, 
 agricultural objections to the south  
 and the nearness of the Nee Forest.   </content>
