		<content> A survey was done in 1981 to ask women
 if they would like to work shifts.Very
 few wanted but would if their jobs    
 depended on it.Two areas have ladies  
 working a two shift system.In three   
 shift areas like Kit Kat only men work
 as there is no exemption.             
{How do you find out what is happening 
{all over the factory?                 
 Simply by listening.We communicate    
 with a briefing session every six     
 weeks,we pass down information from   
 the factory as a whole,then the       
 departmental managers put in their    
 information etc. For 20 mins every 6  
 weeks each employee is brought into a 
 briefing group of 8-15 people. They   
 are told by the supervisor how much   
 the factory has sold,what overtime is 
 available and any changes likely in   
 the future.
