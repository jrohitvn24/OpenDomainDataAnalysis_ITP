		<title>08CRICKET AND TENNIS    BRIDGE</title>
		<content> There is a Recreation Ground in Bridge
 There is a slide,some swings,a see-saw
 and a metal horse with coloured seats.
 Dad,my brother James and I go down to 
 the Recreation Ground to play cricket.
 On Saturdays and Sundays the Bridge   
 Cricket Club play cricket on the      
 Cricket Pitch.I have watched them     
 playing quite a few times. They have a
 white pavillion where they change.Next
 to the pavillion there is a great big 
 roller.On Sundays in winter they play 
 football on the football pitch.       
 On 6 Tuesdays in June and July some   
 children have tennis coaching on the  
 Tennis Courts on the Recreation Ground
 It is 6pm to 7pm for the Junior       
 Session and 7pm to 8pm for the Senior 
 Session.  We go to Junior Session.It  
 is organized by Mrs.Hill.She sometimes
 has helpers.After 5 weeks practise we 
 have a tournament.It is very exciting.</content>
