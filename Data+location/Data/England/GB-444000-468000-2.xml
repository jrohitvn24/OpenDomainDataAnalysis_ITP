		<title>02   A TYPICAL FARMER</title>
		<content>{Mr Clark lives and farms at Lowlands  
{Farm which lies off a lane leading    
{from the Helperby to Tollerton        
{road.It is a tenant farm and Mr Clark 
{has occupied it since 1972. It is run 
{as a family business and in           
{conjunction with his brother's farm   
{at Shipton by Beningbrough.           
{  The majority of his acreage is given
{over to corn although he also has 45  
{acres of sugar beet and 5 acres of    
{potatoes. Apart from 2.5 acres of poor
{land Mr Clark's land is excellent.    
{Apart from arable land Mr Clark       
{presently owns 22 sheep although      
{normally he has a herd of 100.        
{  Lowlands Farm lies at the end of a  
{mile long drive and is not easy to    
{find. He is still waiting for a man   
{from the Ministry of Agriculture to   
{come and look over his equipment - and
{that was two whole years ago!         </content>
