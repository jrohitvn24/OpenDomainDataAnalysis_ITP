		<title>08My School in Coulsdon</title>
		<content>   I am twelve years old and I am in   
 the first year of a comprehensive     
 school in Coulsdon.                   
   At school there are a number of     
 lessons that I like, these are Art,   
 Games, Computers and Home Economics. I
 like these lessons because I like     
 doing things.                         
   I hate Religious Education and      
 History because they are so boring.   
   I do not like to get a detention, I 
 do not think they teach children      
 anything.                             
   I enjoy sports day, as long as I am 
 not doing anything. I also enjoy doing
 gymnastics because it is fun.         
   When I leave school I would like to 
 be a secretary in an office because I 
 want to work with other people.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
