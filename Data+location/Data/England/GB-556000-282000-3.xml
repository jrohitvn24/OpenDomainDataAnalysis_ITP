		<content> Mr Stacey is Churchwarden at St.Peters
 and told us about how the Church was  
 used.                                 
 'Although we have a Parish Church the 
 people who come on Sunday is low. The 
 Church shares its Vicar with another  
 two Parishes. We see him normaly for  
 one hour each month. We miss the      
 village Vicar as we used to have a    
 congregation of fifty or more. We only
 get this number on Festivals like the{
{Harvest Supper}held in the{Village    
{Hall}or the{Plough Service.'          
  'The Church Spire is being repaired  
 at the moment and we have already     
 raised{eleven hundred pounds}in four  
 months. It will cost{three thousand   
{pounds}to repair; we will raise the   
 money easily. There is no Sunday      
 school but the Curate who takes the   
 other services plays the guitar in    
 the Family Services.                  </content>
