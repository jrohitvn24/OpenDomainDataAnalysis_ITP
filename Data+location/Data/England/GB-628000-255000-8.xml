asked him about his working day. From  
Monday to Saturday he gets up at 4:30  
am goes to work and begins sorting the 
letters for Wickham and surrounding    
areas. He enjoys his job in the summer 
but too cold in the winter, but he     
likes being outdoors and likes meeting 
people. He has been a postman for 16   
years. The postoffice itself has       
changed buildings, the sorting office  
used to be a stable or carriage house  
at the back of what was the Vine Inn.At
6:30 he has finished sorting and he    
goes on one of five different rounds.  
One half the village is done each      
morning which we call town one and two,
and is roughly divided into top        
Wickham and the bottom. His deliveries 
stop at 11 am and he has a break until 
2:30 ehen he goes back to work until   
4:30. He delivers first class mail in  </content>
