		<content> We came to a foot bridge over the     
 river Morda.This river was quite deep 
 and had small brown fish in it.We     
 walked up a lane and turned right     
 where there was a postbox and a couple
 of houses.We passed the houses and    
 came to a small wood.The trees arched 
 over the road.A five feet tall hedge  
 grew along the sides of the road      
 obscuring the view.There was a        
 picturesque black and white house with
 pine doors called The Croft.We came to
 the village hall and a disused        
 chapel.It still had an old organ and a
 piano in it.At last we reached our    
 destination and rested in the shade of
 Saint John's Church                   
 .
