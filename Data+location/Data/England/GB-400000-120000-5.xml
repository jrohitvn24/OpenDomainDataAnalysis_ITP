		<title>05FARMING IN BOWERCHALKE</title>
		<content> FARMING is the main Industry.         
 This consists of the breeding of sheep
 &amp; horses, the rearing of cows for milk
 and beef and arable farming. One      
 farmer has a 7 acre vineyard; another 
 runs a business in agricultural       
 machinery trading abroad.             
 The soil is greensand in the valley;  
 on the slopes there is chalk about a  
 foot down, whilst on the top of the   
 hills the soil is clay &amp; flint.       
 There are 7 main farms between 600 &amp;  
 1200 acres. Three smaller units for   
 beef fattening are about 50 acres each
 - one is a tenant of the Local        
 Authority. A smallholder rears rarer  
 sheep for wool. Most of the farmers   
 bear CONSERVATION in mind: one is     
 replanting hedges, another reduces    
 them to a minimum. Two farmers have   
 planted small deciduous plantations.  
 Stubble burning continues.            </content>
