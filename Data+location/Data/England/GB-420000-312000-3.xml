   The small church in the village is  
dedicated to the Holy Trinity. In 1975 
the tower had to be rebuilt following  
damage by gales.                       
    The village school, which caters   
for the childrens educational needs    
from the age of four until they are    
eleven,is called the Mary Howard       
Primary after a former benefactress.   
     The two general stores are        
important to the life of the villagers 
since it is several miles to the       
nearest town and some people do not own
a car.The public service bus calls just
four times a day.One of the shops also 
serves as a Post Office.               
    The purpose built Village Hall has 
a playing field and childrens          
playground adjacent to it and in the   
same area there is the school playing  
field.                                 </content>
