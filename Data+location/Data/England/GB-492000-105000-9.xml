		<content>  An interview with Mrs. Smith.        
  a) Where did you live as a child?    
  I lived at levelmare lane which is   
 just off Fontwell Avenue.I had two    
 miles to walk to school every day down
 that old muddy lane at Northfields    
 before I reached Nyton road then on   
 down Westergate Street.I used to do   
 that when I was 5 with my friends.    
  b) How much has the village changed  
 since you were little? Today there are
 many more houses than when I was a    
 girl.Westergate Street didn't have    
 any roads leading off,only one little 
 muddy lane which was Ivy lane leading 
 to a few cottages.All the other roads 
 have been built in more recent times. 
 The playing field  (The old recreation
 ground)which is now Barnetts field.It 
 had two swings,a seesaw, and a cricket
 &amp; Football pitch .                    
                                       </content>
