		<content> The parish church ,The Church of the  
 Holy Rood,is just outside the study   
 area.It is a thriving institution     
 which was founded in the early 12     
 century.It still has a Norman tower   
 but there have been many alterations  
 through the years.There are 3         
 interesting early alabaster tomb      
 stones inside the church.The church is
 built of local sandstone.             
 The Methodist Chapel is in the High   
 Street.It has a small congregation and
 is part of the Ashby Circuit.It is the
 only building in the area to be built 
 of Charnwood Granites.                
 There was once a Baptist Chapel in    
 Mill Street.Its red brick building has
 been demolished and its graveyard     
 cleared.
