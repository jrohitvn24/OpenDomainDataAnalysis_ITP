		<title>10The Cemetery Ipswich</title>
		<content>The Cemetery is situated to the north  
of Ipswich next to the railway line.   
The Cemetery in Ipswich is             
approximately 1km by 475m.The cemetery 
has been going since 1859 and the      
graves are still being dug.The most    
common gravestone is made of           
granite,because marble is too          
expensive.                             
  There are three chapels in the       
Cemetery one in the North part, one    
West and one crematoria.The chapels are
approximately 6 by 12m.80% of the      
people who die are cremated.The        
commonest hymn sung is Psalm 23 which  
is The Lord Is My Shepherd.
