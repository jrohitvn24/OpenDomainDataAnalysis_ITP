		<title>15Day in My Life - Parent 2</title>
		<content> My husband came home and spent a good 
 part of the evening on the 'phone     
 arranging  for a two week mission in  
 August. I called the children in about
 7.40pm - but they do quiet things and 
 settle down to bed about 9.00 We don't
 usually have the television on at this
 time.                                 
 My husband and I put on a video -     
 science fiction movie made in 1984. I 
 watched about half of it, but it was  
 boring so I went to bed. I had to be  
 up early the next day because theere  
 was a minister's meeting at our house 
 the next day.                         
                                       
 This passage was written by the       
 American wife of a Pastor of the      
 Independent Church.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
