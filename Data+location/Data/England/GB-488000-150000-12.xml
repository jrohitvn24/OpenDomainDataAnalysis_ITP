		<content>   Heathcote Memorial C of E Middle    
 School was built in 1860 by the Church
 of England in union with the National 
 Society. It is named after the Rev.   
 Gilbert Wall Heathcote who was Rector 
 of Ash l838-1884. Ash National School 
 (now demolished) was built in l835 and
 had become too small for the numbers  
 of children attending.                
   Heathcote School became known as Ash
 Common School due to its location and 
 is still referred to in this way by   
 many people in the village.           
   It has always been looked on as the 
 village school and some pupils now are
 the 4th or 5th generation of their    
 family to have been educated here.    
   The century and a quarter has been  
 marked by an exhibition of photographs
 and children's work and a musical and 
 dramatic production of the school's   
 history performed by the pupils.      </content>
