		<title>02FRUIT GROWING NEAR CANTERB'Y</title>
		<content> Much of the land immediately east of  
 Canterbury is important for fruit     
 growing.  The area has deep,          
 well-drained loamy soils mainly       
 derived from brickearth.  The climate 
 is ideal with low annual rainfall(600-
 625mm per annum), favourable summer   
 temperatures(18C in July), adequate   
 sunshine and freedom from damaging    
 frosts.  Another factor is the        
 excellent communications -A2/M2 which 
 links London to the continent.        
 The main top fruits of the area       
 surveyed are dessert apples, plums and
 cherries.  The dominant apple variety 
 variety is Cox's Orange Pippin with   
 some Worcester Permain.  The two main 
 pear varieties are Conference and     
 Doyenne du Camice.  There are also    
 some cherries and Victoria plums      
 grown.
