		<title>15GRANGELAND PARK ESTATE</title>
		<content> We carried out a survey of the        
 reisdents of Grangeland Park housing  
 estate to find out where they had come
 from and if they had moved because of 
 their job.                            
 We interviewed 236 householders, 41%  
 had moved from within Congleton, 27%  
 from within 20 miles and 32% from over
 20 miles away. Agood number of the 41%
 who moved from within Congleton had   
 moved here originally because of their
 jobs but to a different part of       
 Congleton, mainly the West Heath area.
 Overall 42% of the residents on the   
 estate had moved because of a job and 
 58% had not. Here are some examples of
 the companies which people had moved  
 to: I.C.I. (11), Siemens (6), I.C.L.  
 (5), G.E.C. and Ciba-Geigy (2) each.
