		<title>05DECLINE OF WALTON AMENITIES.</title>
		<content>   As the survey went ahead and we went
 round the local streets, we were      
 surprised by how few amenities there  
 were. We expected to find a great deal
 to record and investigate but were    
 disappointed. The local library had   
 closed down. This used to be open full
 time but has now been replaced by a   
 mobile library which parks on the     
 recreation ground once a week. The old
 library buildings are now being used  
 as a community centre. The post office
 has also closed down and this service 
 has not been replaced. A similar thing
 has happened to many of the small     
 'corner' shops that were once quite   
 common. These services are now        
 supplied in the centre of town or in  
 the new townships. This puts those    
 people without transport at a         
 disadvantage.
