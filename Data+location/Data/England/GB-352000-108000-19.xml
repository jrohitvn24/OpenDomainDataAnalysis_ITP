		<title>19Pendomer &amp; Halstock-Skittles</title>
		<content> Almost every village pub in Somerset  
 and Dorset has its skittle alley.     
 There are pub teams, works teams, WI  
 teams, farmers' club teams - enough to
 provide fixtures most evenings through
 from autumn to spring. The game is    
 enjoyed by both men and women of all  
 ages. Halstock's pub is no exception. 
 For the benefit of strangers to the   
 West Country, it should perhaps be    
 explained that skittles is played on a
 wooden floor about thirty feet long   
 and six feet wide - butthe            
 measurements vary. Nine wooden        
 skittles about a foot high are set up 
 in a recognised pattern at one end,   
 and each member of the team in turn   
 rolls three balls, one at a time, from
 the other. The aim is to knock down as
 many skittles as possible. Knocking   
 down all nine in one go gains an extra
 point.                                </content>
