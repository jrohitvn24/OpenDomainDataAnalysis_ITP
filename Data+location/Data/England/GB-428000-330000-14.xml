		<content> Transport plays an important part in  
 the lives of the present inhabitants  
 of Findern. The class ofeleven year   
 old children carried out a survey to  
 find out what parents commonly used.  
 Most peoples parants in the class have
 their own private form of             
 transport. Most dads have a car,a     
 moped or a motorbike.Mums who work    
 often go by bus like my mum           
 does. Others have a little car that   
 would be bought second hand. Some who 
 have more money may get a new car.    
 Most parents in our class have a car  
 but some have other vehicles.Most     
 children have a bycicle which they    
 ride to school.Some mums and dads do  
 too.
