		<title>02The Landscape of Felton Area</title>
		<content> This area is one of low lying, gently 
 ridged topography, entirely underlain 
 by folded reddish-brown mudstones with
 some thin sandstones and nodular      
 calcareous beds of the Devonian       
 Series.  The area is crossed          
 diagonally by the alluvial flats of   
 the Little Lugg River.  The soils are 
 silty loams of the Bromyard Series,   
 suitable for mixed farming.  The      
 higher ridges have deciduous woodland 
 on steeper slopes.  Elsewhere woodland
 has been reduced, but field boundaries
 contain mature small-leaved lime      
 trees, ash, oak and sycamore.  The elm
 has everywhere died out although some 
 natural regeneration may be occuring. 
 Field sizes vary from five acres up to
 forty acres.  There are a number of   
 scattered farms and parts of five     
 minor settlements.
