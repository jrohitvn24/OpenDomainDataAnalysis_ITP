		<title>06THE SEA FRONT IN HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> For the holiday makers there are      
 trampolines, a slide and a roundabout 
 on the beach and deckchairs can be    
 hired.There is a children's holiday   
 show in the bandstand and also a small
 track where people can try out the new
 Sinclair C5 electric tricycle. Several
 local people have beach huts as their 
 base for a day at the sea.            
 Particularly popular with the         
 teenagers are the amusement arcades   
 with rows of electronic bleeping      
 machines. There are many cafes and    
 reasonably priced restaurants along   
 the seafront but unfortunately 1985 is
 proving to be one of the wettest      
 English summers on record, thousands  
 of people are making late bookings for
 Spain, and many people who depend on  
 Herne Bay's meagre tourist trade will 
 be badly hit.                         
                                       </content>
