		<title>15WORSTON MILL RESTAURANT</title>
		<content> Worston Mill is a popular place for   
 socialising.  Up to 50 people a night 
 eat in the restaurant in the summer.  
 Many more just come to drink and maybe
 have a meal at the bar.  The bar is   
 open in accordance with the licensing 
 laws 11am to 2.30 or 3pm and 6pm to   
 11pm on weekdays, and from 12 to 2pm, 
 and 7pm to 10.30pm on Sundays.  About 
 500 gallons of beer are consumed in a 
 week.  It sells at 70p a pint.  Lager 
 is also popular, and Cinzano and      
 Martini for the ladies.  More people  
 are drinking wine though there is also
 a trend towards soft drinks because of
 the drink/driving laws.  Of the bar   
 meals scampi and chips at Â£3.50 is    
 very much liked.  People can sit      
 outside, two of the tables are        
 converted mill-wheels.  There are     
 swings and slides for the children.
