		<title>17Village Shops in Northants</title>
		<content>   It is getting more difficult for    
village shops to survive against       
competition of the large supermarkets  
in the town.They usually stock a wide  
range of goods but the prices are      
inevitably higher than  those in the   
supermarkets which can buy in bulk.    
  {How do these small village shops    
survive,especially in the villages     
close to the town?}                    
  They are obviously more convenient,  
especially for those who find it       
difficult to travel to the town. These 
are usually the more elderly people or 
women with babies or young children.   
The village shop also offers a more    
personal service. The  shopkeeper      
knows his customers &amp; will have more   
time to  talk to them.                 
  Many people prefer this to waiting in
long queues in the supermarket.
