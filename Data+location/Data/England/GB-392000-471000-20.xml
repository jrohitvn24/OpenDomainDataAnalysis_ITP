		<title>20WEATHER IN LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>   Littondale is situated in the upland
 areas of the Pennines, and, therefore,
 attracts quite a lot of wet weather.  
 The winters tend to be long, more     
 often then not very cold, with quite a
 lot of snow, and or rain.  The        
 prevailing wind is west/south west,   
 which means in tends to blow from the 
 top end of the Dale.  Our late spring 
 and summer tend to merge, and         
 frequently autumn is over quickly. In 
 good summers, temperatures in the Dale
 bottom can be surprisingly high.
