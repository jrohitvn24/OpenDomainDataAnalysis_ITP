{year old Jane:}My family consists of  
 mum and dad and 5 children.My sister  
 and I are twins.                      
   I get up at 7.30am and have cereals,
 toast and tea for breakfast.Then I    
 catch the double-decker bus that takes
 me to the Aveland Secondary Modern    
 school in Billingborough.             
   I like school.My favourite subjects 
 are English,Mathematics and History.I 
 hate Games lessons but enjoy swimming 
 in the school pool.                   
   School ends at 3.45 pm,and as soon  
 as I get home,I change out of my      
 school clothes and do my Homework or  
 watch Television.We have tea at about 
 6.00 pm.My favourite food is fish and 
 chips,followed by ice-cream.          
   We help wash up after tea,then      
 either watch T.V.or play tennis.At 9pm
 it's supper time,then we go to bed.   </content>
