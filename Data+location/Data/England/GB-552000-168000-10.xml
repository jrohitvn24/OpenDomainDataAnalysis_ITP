		<content>  We asked people living in our area   
what they thought of the sports        
facilities available in the area.There 
is an 18 hole golf course,2 driving    
ranges,1 putting green,2 swimming pools
,tennis courts,boxing,weight training, 
badmington,squash,judo and table tennis
available.The opinions varied from poor
to excellent,with most people thinking 
they were adequate.A few of those asked
traveled out of the area to sporting   
activities.The people who answered our 
questionnaire,used their leisure time  
in a number of different ways.Most of  
them listened to the radio and all     
watched TV at some time.Gardening was a
very popular activity throughout the   
survey,and DIY was also popular.Fishing
,shooting,sailing,motoring,cycling and 
walking were all minority.The most     
unusual hobby was tiddly-winks,and more
women did knitting than sewing.        </content>
