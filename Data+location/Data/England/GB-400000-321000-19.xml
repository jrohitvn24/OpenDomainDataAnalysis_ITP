The Haywood Society emerged from an    
action group who formed to object to   
the planned telephone exchange. As a   
result of their objection the planned  
height was reduced. They then became   
affiliated to the Civic Trust and      
formed an amenities society. Over the  
10 years of their existence they have  
helped by tidying the crossroads and   
railway enbankment, making proposals to
local councils which they think might  
be a help to the area such as an access
road from the by-pass to St. Mary's,   
and by objecting to some planning      
applications, for example the proposal 
of a tip at  the site of the old       
brickworks, as it is a marvellous      
habitat for wildlife and needs         
preserving. There are approximately 75 
members who meet monthly. Meetings are 
often addressed by guest speakers.     </content>
