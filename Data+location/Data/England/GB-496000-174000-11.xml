		<title>11GREAT PARK    OLD WINDSOR</title>
		<content> Part of the 400 acres of Windsor Great
 Park lies in the block;it is an area  
 of open grassland, woodland and farms 
 originally part of the Great Royal    
 Hunting Forest owned by the Crown and 
 most is open to the public;picnicing, 
 jogging,fishing,horse riding (with a  
 permit),are some of the activities    
 here.Charitable organisations hold    
 functions here and a model aircraft   
 flying club with 150 members uses the 
 area.                                 
 The first Domesday Book mentions Old  
 Windsor as the 2nd largest village in 
 Berkshire;William the Conqueror       
 directed the building of Windsor      
 Castle from here.The A308 bisects the 
 land area;80 new houses were built in 
 Saxon Close in 1985.The annual village
 carnival reflects the strong community
 spirit.The carnival theme for 1985 was
 "Trades and Professions".             </content>
