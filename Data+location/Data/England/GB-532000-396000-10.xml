		<content>  In the 1930's it had it's own phone  
 exchange.It is now owned by Keith &amp;   
 Valarie Davis. They have 2 daughters  
 called Natalie &amp; Kelly.When Keith was 
 clearing the garage out he found a old
 bakers oven.Now the post office sells 
 items such as sweets,crisps,cigarets, 
 cigars,ice_creams,frozen foods &amp; toys 
 etc..It's the only post office_shop in
 Fulstow village.The shop is busy      
 throughout the week but on a Saturday 
 it is even busier.On a Sunday the shop
 is not open.People think that Fulstow 
 shop is far better than Covenham post 
 office_shop because it's far cheaper &amp;
 it sells much more.
