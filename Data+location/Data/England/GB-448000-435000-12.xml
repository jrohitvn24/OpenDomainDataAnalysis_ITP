		<content>    Some animals are kept under        
{intensive}conditions.The most common  
 are beef cattle,calves,sheep and      
 pigs.On Rose Farm,C.F. 108 beef cattle
 are kept.Most animals are sold at     
 auctions at Wetherby and York.        
    Farmers work long hours,8 to 12    
 hours each day.Busiest time of year is
 harvesting for arable farmers and     
 lambing for livestock rearers.Most    
 seem contented in job and if had the  
 opportunity to choose again would     
 still be farmers.                     
    None had problems of vandalism.    
 Rabbits and crows are causing damage  
 to young grain crops.Farmers use crop 
 rotation as soils vary between        
 limestone and heavy clay.Most farmers 
 have drained land using plastic       
 pipes.New straw burning laws encourage
 farmers to plough stubble into        
 the land.                             </content>
