 FOR THE {TRENT HOUSE }BECAUSE THEY OWN
 THE MAJORITY OF THE LAND. IT SEEMED   
 RIGHT TO MAKE USE OF THE LAST PIECE OF
 SPARE GROUND FOR BUILDING. SCHOOL, BUS
 ROUTES AND SHOPS ARE ALL IMPORTANT    
 FACTORS THAT HELP BRIDGEWATER ESTATES 
 TO DECIDE WHERE THEIR HOUSES SHOULD BE
 BUILT. THEY DO THE MARKET RESEARCH    
 BEFORE DECIDING WHAT TO BUILD. 20     
 YEARS AGO {TYLDESLEY }WAS A {MINING   
{AREA. }BEFORE THEY CAN DO ANYTHING    
 THEY HAVE TO DO A {MINING SURVEY}OF   
 THE LAND TO ASSESS THE SAFETY OF THE  
 AREA .THE ACREAGE OF THE {HENFOLD     
{HOUSING ESTATE}IS 22 ACRES. DURING    
 1985 BUILDING HAS BEEN EXTENDED AND

{AND  BODMIN ROAD}TOGETHER. NOWADAYS 3

 BEING BUILT HERE.
