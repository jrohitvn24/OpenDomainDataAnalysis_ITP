		<content> An R.A.F. station is in our area      
  with a variety of military transport.
 This includes cars,lorries,buses ,1   
 rubbish cart,1 ambulance,1 fire truck,
 12 Tanks (Scorpions), 30  armoured    
 personnel vehicles  (Spartans), 2     
 recovery vehicles (Sampsons),2 command
 vehicles (Sultans) and 16 Land Rovers.
 The Balloon Section includes vehicles 
 (each travelling 1,000-1,500 miles    
 each week) and 12 gas carrying 20     
 Tonne lorries.We are able to watch the
 Airmen practice parachute drops out of
 the balloon -basket on the airfield,  
 from our school playground . At       
 intervals Hercules aircraft bring men 
 across the airfield to "drop" from the
 rear door. Annually Harriers use the  
 airfield as a practice base.Some of   
 the service children's houses are near
 the airfield and they watch the       
 vertical take-offs with interest.     </content>
