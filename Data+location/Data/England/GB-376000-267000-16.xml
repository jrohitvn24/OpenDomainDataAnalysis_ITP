 buildings, now a private house, are   
 along a track behind the {POUND FARM.

 1960's. The school's numbers qualify  
 it for{2.5 teachers}(over 45 children 
 and under 61 aged between 4 and 11).  
                                       
   As the headmistress,{MRS HAMPSON,}  
 has just had a baby daughter, there is
 an acting headmistress at the school. 
                                       
   At 11+ the children move to the {
