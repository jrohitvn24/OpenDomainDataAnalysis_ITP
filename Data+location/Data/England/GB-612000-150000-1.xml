     Our Domesday project work was     
 based almost exclusively on field work
 covering our whole 12km block.Although
 about 8 field trips were undertaken we
 met very few people, on average one   
 per expedition.                       
                                       
     Therefore the information gathered
 for this section of the survey is     
 based on that easily available to the 
 school in Petham. Poor weather in the 
 early part of the term made the time  
 constraints tighter still and         
 prevented the gathering of more       
 detailed information especially from  
 local people in the Upper and Lower   
 Hardres areas.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
