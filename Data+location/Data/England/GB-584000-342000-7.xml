		<title>07TIDES AND DANGERS AT OVERY</title>
		<content> The tides and mudholes at Burnham     
 Overy Creek are very dangerous because
 the tides come in very quickly.  Many 
 holiday makers get stranded on the    
 marshes.  If you are stuck in a       
 mudhole and the tide comes in you     
 would drown.  As well as the holes    
 there is quick-sand.  A little child  
 who was only five year's old was      
 drowned in one of the holes.  The     
 quick-sand just looks like ordinary   
 mud, if you step on it you may sink   
 instantly so you have to take care in 
 Burnham Overy Creek.  Another danger  
 was the floods in 1953.  There are    
 lots of little passages running       
 through and round the marshes and they
 are dangerous because the strong      
 current can take you out to sea.
