		<title>11THE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> When we arrived, the firemen drove the
 fire engine outside for us to look at.
 They showed us the fire fighting      
 equipment and protective clothing. A  
 fireman put on the oxygen tank and    
 mask to show us how to breathe during 
 a fire. Inside we saw the telephone,  
 the sirens and other apparatus. We    
 tried on the firemen's helmets and    
 then the firemen got out the hoses and
 let us have turns in spraying water.  
 Suddenly there was a fire call to     
 London Road so we had to stand back   
 whilst the firemen dashed into the    
 engine and rushed off. They were very 
 well organised, sliding down a pole   
 and dressing as they ran so that      
 they didn't waste any time. On the    
 way back to school we looked for fire 
 hydrants and counted six in the mile  
 or so between Wiltshire Road and      
 school. It was a very enjoyable visit.</content>
