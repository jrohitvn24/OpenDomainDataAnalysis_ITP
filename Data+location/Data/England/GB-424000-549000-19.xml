		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AMANDA</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30 in the morning,get   
 washed and brush my teeth,then run    
 downstairs and have breakfast of toast
 and a cup of tea.After breakfast I    
 pack my bag ready for school,and at   
 8.40  I am picked up by car and taken 
 to school.We start school at 9.00 am  
 then I take my place at my desk and do
 the work that is set for me.At        
 playtime I play hide and seek with the
 rest of the children.Lessons follow   
 but soon it is dinner time;I have a   
 packed lunch,my favourite being cheese
 sandwiches,a chocolate biscuit and a  
 packet of crisps,with a drink.School  
 finishes at 3.30pm and when I go home 
 I play out until 5.30pm;then I go     
 inside for tea.My favourite tea is    
 pizza and chips.Then I go and play    
 with my friends until I come in at    
 9.30pm and go to bed.
