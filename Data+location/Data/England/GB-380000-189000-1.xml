		<content>  Our block lies in the southern       
 Cotswolds about 4 miles south of      
 Nailsworth. Most of the block         
 is in the county of                   
 Gloucestershire, but some of          
 the western part is in the            
 county of Avon.                       
 Nearly all the land is used for       
 farming, especially arable farming.   
 The A46 Stroud-Bath road runs         
 through our block from north east to  
 south west. There is a little woodland
 in the area, most of it in the south  
 east corner where part of the         
 Westonbirt Arboretum called the Silk  
 Wood falls in our block.              
  There are very few houses in the     
 area. The only village is the small   
 village of Leighterton.
