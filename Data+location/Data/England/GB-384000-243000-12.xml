		<title>12TRANSPORT IN SEVERN STOKE</title>
		<content>    Two major transport routes traverse
 the area from north to south. The{M5  
 runs through Croome Park to the east, 
 but with no accesss roads connecting  
 it to the local route network. The{A38
 forms the major transport route       
 through the area, winding its way     
 through Severn Stoke and connecting   
 with a number of B roads. The M5 has  
 taken a lot of pressure off the A38,  
 which used to be very congested around
 Severn Stoke.                         
    There are four{bus stops}in Severn 
 Stoke with regular services connecting
 the area with Worcester and           
 Gloucester.                           
    The{River Severn}no longer serves  
 as a major transport route for the    
 region.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
