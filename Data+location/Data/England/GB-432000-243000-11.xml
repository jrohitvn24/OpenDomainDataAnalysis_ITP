		<title>11FARMING - TYSOE - SMALL FARM</title>
		<content> An analysis of the farms with houses  
 close to the village reveals that they
 are farmed very much as they have been
 for generations. In fact one farmer   
 has recently decided to revert to     
 organic farming and discard the modern
 chemical methods methods. Much of the 
 land is deep ridge and furrow and is  
 crossed by many Public footpaths.     
 Water comes from the Mains supply but 
 a few fields are still fed from       
 springs. Certain innovations have been
 incorporated over the years. The main 
 changes are the general mechanisation,
 the lack of labour employed and the   
 huge increase in prices and capital   
 involved. These small family farmers  
 are, in the main, optimistic about the
 future, and think that in spite of all
 hardships, farming in this area of    
 Warwickshire will continue for many   
 more years.                           </content>
