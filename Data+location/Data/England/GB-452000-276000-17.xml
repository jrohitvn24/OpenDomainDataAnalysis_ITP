		<content>   Policing of Catthorpe and the       
 surrounding villages is done by one   
 policeman who is stationed in         
 Lutterworth.The last time Catthorpe   
 had it's own policeman was 10 years   
 ago and he lived in Swinford.         
   Because Catthorpe is a small village
 everybody knows everybody else,so few 
 crimes are commited.                  
   The people of the village get       
 regular visits from the policeman,    
 although they never know when he is   
 going to come.It has been found that  
 adopting a friendly approach to the   
 villagers,reduces the problems of     
 policing,resulting in an average      
 crime rate of 6-7 a year.             
   The village is visited once a       
 fortnight by a mobile library.        
   There is a bus service 3 times a    
 week from Rugby and once a day from   
 Lutterworth (except Sunday.)          </content>
