 house at around 8-05.We stay for 10 to
 15 minutes and call for Justine.We go 
 to the shop and I buy something to eat
 on the way to school.At school we have
 a playtime 'till around 9-05.We go    
 into assembly and reappear at  9-25.

 Maths or English..At 10-30 we go out  
 to break,this lasts for 15 minutes
