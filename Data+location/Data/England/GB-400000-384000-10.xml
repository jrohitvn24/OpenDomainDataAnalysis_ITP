		<title>10Notable Events in New Mills</title>
		<content> New Mills is very good for events     
 such as the carnivals and galas.      
 Every year all the schools have their 
 sports up at the New Mills Sports     
 Ground. We compete with each other in 
 flat races and obstacle races.        
 The carnival is to raise money for the
 swimming pool.                        
 This year the New Mills Football Club 
 organised a gala up on the football   
 ground. It had a B.M.X. competition, a
 5-a-side football match competition   
 and a sports day with water races and 
 obstacle races for the New Mills      
 children.
