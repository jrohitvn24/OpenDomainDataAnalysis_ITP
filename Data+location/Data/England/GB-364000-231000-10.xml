		<title>10Kempley Church</title>
		<content> Kempley church was built in 1100 and  
 is of Norman design with a beautiful  
 Norman arch over the doorway. It is   
 built of stone from the Forest of Dean
 and has very thick walls. Inside the  
 church there are drawings on the walls
 called Frescoes which are very famous.
 They were painted in the thirteenth   
 and fourteenth centuries and show the 
 twelve apostles. The church has got   
 some stained glass windows but quite a
 lot are clear. It is a very pretty    
 church surrounded by a small          
 graveyard.In the Spring the fields    
 around the church are filled with wild
 daffodils which people come from far  
 and near to see. Kempley church       
 doesn't have a vicar of its own but   
 shares one with three other churches. 
 There is a service every Sunday.
