		<title>08DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> The typical Doddinghurst child comes  
 from a home where mother{works}part-  
 time. Unemployment in this area is low
 and most children do not lack for     
 material needs. All of the{houses}are 
 equipped with modern facilities.      
  According to our survey, television  
 is the most important feature of      
{leisure}in the home. Everyone owns at 
 least one T.V. and about 80% have a   
 video. The children spend between 1   
 and 3 hours a day watching television.
  The day begins at about 7.30am when  
 the child plays or reads in their own 
 bedroom. During the week breakfast is 
 self-service but at the weekend the   
 family eats together. Father leaves   
 for{work}between 7-7:30 a.m. and the  
 child at about 8:30. After school the 
 child plays out with friends or       
 at home with toys or with their home  
 computer.                             </content>
