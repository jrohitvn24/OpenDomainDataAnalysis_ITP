		<content> Truro houses a great number of small  
 Art and craft industries,some of which
 rely on grants and assistance for     
 amall businesses. Whilst Pottery seems
 to be the most popular of these,others
 such as leatherwork and basketry can  
 also be found. The craftsmen are now  
 organising themselves into guilds and 
 co-operatives in order to meke a more 
 successful venture. The County Museum 
 and Art Gallery exhibits the          
 collections of the Royal Institution  
 of Cornwall. It also houses Cornish   
 minerals, birds, pottery and historic 
 furniture. In the Art Galleries are   
 Opie paintings and drawings by Rubens,
 Canaletto, Constable and Gainsborough.
 County Hall houses an ever changing   
 exhibition of children's two          
 dimensional Art work.
