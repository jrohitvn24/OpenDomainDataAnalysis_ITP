		<content> Our dinner ladies are called Mrs Reed 
 and Mrs Fullerton.Mrs Reed is very    
 kind.She watches us at dinner time,   
 play time and buys sweets for us and  
 takes us on to the field for play     
 time.Mrs Fullerton is very kind too   
 because she doesn't get mad with the  
 infants when they dawdle about not    
 knowing what to get for dinner. We    
 have a few choices of what to have for
 dinner. Once a month the dinner man   
 brings choc-ices but usually it is    
 yogurt,apples ,cake, custard and      
 sometimes cream cakes. Sometimes      
 Ribena or drinking chocolate or milk  
 shake. On Mondays when you come       
 into school you go into the kitchen   
 to pay for your dinner.You pay        
 Â£2.50 for a weeks dinner.We have      
 dinner in a room that we call         
 the middle room.
