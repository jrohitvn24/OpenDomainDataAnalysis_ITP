		<title>15THE ELEANOR CROSS</title>
		<content>Geddington is best known for its       
monument to Queen Eleanor, wife of     
Edward I. The Eleanor Cross was built  
in the centre of the village in 1294.  
Eleanor died in 1290 at Harby in       
Nottinghamshire whilst travelling to   
meet Edward I in Scotland. The cortege 
carrying Eleanor's body from Harby to  
Westminster completed the journey in   
a number of easy stages at each        
stopping point a monument later being  
erected. The 3 remaining crosses are at
Geddington, Northampton and Waltham    
Cross.                                 
The Cross is triangular in plan and    
stands on a base of 7 steps. The       
clustered mouldings and roses of the   
first stage have been worn almost      
smooth but the whole monument, its     
statues and pinnacles is in good       
condition.
