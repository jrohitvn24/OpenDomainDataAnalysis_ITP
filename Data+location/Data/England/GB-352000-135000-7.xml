		<content> Bridge Farm, which is several hundred 
 years old, and Lower Farm are a       
 combined unit of 361 acres. A mixed   
 farm, they employ two full time       
 workers and a student.                
 There are 123 milking fresians and 2  
 dry cows (1 newly born and the other 4
 years old).                           
 They are milked at 6.30am and 3.30pm  
 and produce around 1200 litres of milk
 per day. At the moment 28 are kept    
 inside because of ringworm. There are 
 two bulls.                            
 A new drainage system is presently    
 being constructed in the yard.        
 There is a small flock of 28 of the   
 rare Shropshire breed of sheep. They  
 are shorn very early in order to      
 encourage quick regrowth of a second  
 fleece.                               
 30 acres of barley are grown and      
 there is a cider apple orchard.       </content>
