		<title>15TRANSPORT IN KINGS LANGLEY</title>
		<content>{RAIL}_ About 144 trains pass K.Langley
 daily,linking London with the Midlands
 and the North. Hourly trains connect  
 with London and Milton Keynes.        
{ROAD}_ The two main roads carry an    
 excess of heavy industrial traffic,   
 much of which went by rail a          
 generation ago. Buses run to Watford  
 and Hemel Hempstead daily every       
 half_hour except Sundays. The service 
 across the valley to the station is   
 for school_children &amp; commuters, so   
 not at weekends.                      
{THE M25}_ The valley is dominated by  
 the huge supports which will carry the
 new motorway high above river, canal, 
 railway and roads and intersect with  
 the A41 a mile south of the village.A 
 42 metre span between the supports    
 will afford some view along the       
 valley. Completion will solve some    
 problems but bring others.            </content>
