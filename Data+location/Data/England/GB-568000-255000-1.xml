		<content> Gently rolling countryside covering   
 the parish of Kirtling &amp; parts of     
 Lidgate, Cowlinge &amp; Great Bradley.    
 Predominantly arable farmland growing 
 barley,wheat,rape,potatoes and peas.  
 Pasture for horses,sheep &amp; cows. Wood-
 land &amp; copses of deciduous &amp; conifer- 
 ous trees providing cover for game    
 birds &amp; deer.Pastimes include pheasant
 shooting,foxhunting,rambling &amp; riding 
 along the numerous footpaths &amp; bridle-
 ways. Ample gardens surround both old 
 &amp; modern houses producing flowers &amp; in
 many cases,enough vegetables to supply
 the household needs.Employment is on  
 the land or in neighbouring towns,the 
 nearest being Newmarket. There is an  
 interesting Norman parish church &amp; a  
 Catholic church.A fine gatehouse,known
 as Kirtling Towers remains on the     
 moated site of the Old Kirtling Hall.
