		<title>10THE CROMFORD CANAL PRESENT</title>
		<content>   The{Cromford canal}ran from{Langley 
{Mill}to{Cromford,}near Matlock in     
 Derbyshire. In{Jacksdale}the canal    
 runs by the side of the{River Erewash.
   A canal is different to a river     
 because it is man made and often has  
 brick or stone sides instead of a     
 bank. Most of the{Cromford canal}is   
 now closed and near{Jacksdale}parts of
 it are overgrown with reeds.Other     
 parts have been used for dumping      
 rubbish. There are car tyres,         
 armchairs and scooters in it. The     
 remains of the locks (used to get     
 boats from one level of the canal to  
 another) can still be seen but the    
 wooden gates are no longer there. Over
 one of the locks there is now a       
 concrete bridge. The canal was used to
 transport coal to factories by        
 narrowboat. The canal became redundant
 when the nearby railway was built.    </content>
