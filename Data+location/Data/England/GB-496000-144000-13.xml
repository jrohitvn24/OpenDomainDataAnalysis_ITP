		<content> Farncombe was a very little village   
 when the church was built. It was     
 built to hold 400 people, but as      
 Farncombe grew more space was needed. 
 So they decided to put another room   
 with doors leading to the front and   
 other doors leading to the Lady's     
 Chapel. The Lady's chapel is a part of
 the church where they worship St.     
 Mary. There are lots of wooden benches
 in the church called pews. The priests
 get people coming to prey every day.  
 The little room in which you walk     
 through to go to the church is called 
 a Narthex or meeting place. On Sunday 
 all childen go into a sound proof room
 and there is a loudspeaker so that the
 children can here the service but     
 their noise can't be heard in the     
 church. There are pipes under the     
 church that contain hot water.
