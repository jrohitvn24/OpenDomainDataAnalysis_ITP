		<content> This residential psychiatric hospital,
 centred on a Georgian mansion and     
 park, is involved in a 1984-1994      
 programme under N. Lincs. Health      
 Authority  and Lincs. C.C. Social     
 Services. Residents will move back    
 into community care in their own      
 localities. 100 patients have been    
 moved and the present 300 beds will   
 eventually be reduced to 60.          
{MEDICAL: }Present cover is given by   
 full-time hospital doctors, including 
 a consultant psychiatrist, and local  
 GPs working weekly sessions, assisted 
 by 255 nurses and student nurses.     
 WRVS and others give social help.     
{EDUCATION: }The LEA Special School    
 here expects to lose the 6 remaining  
 children by March 1986. The present 24
 adolescent pupils will move or become 
 part of adult and peripatetic training
 schemes now being developed there.    </content>
