		<title>05Oast Houses in Kent</title>
		<content> The first{Oast Houses}were rectangular
 and small (about 6m by 3m). The       
 traditional painted white wooden{cowl 
 was not added until much later.       
 Early Oast Houses date from the       
 17th to early 18th century and early  
 examples still exist at Woodchurch    
 and Charing Place.                    
 After finding these models were too   
 small, they went on to build cone Oast
 Houses and this is where the          
 traditional white painted{cowl}was    
 added.  They mistakenly believed that 
 cone Oast Houses distributed the heat 
 more evenly.  The{kiln}sloped more to 
 the left, and sometimes the cowl fell 
 off!                                  
 Early in the 19th century they        
 discovered that rectangular Oast      
 Houses were just as efficient and     
 easier to build, so they returned to  
 this design.                          </content>
