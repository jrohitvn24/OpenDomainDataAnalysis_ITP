		<content> The market on a Tuesday is very big.On
 a Tuesday you buy clothes,cakes,buns  
 fruit and toys and sometimes books.The
 market on a saturday is very small it 
 sells just as much as the market on a 
 Tuesday.                              
         Hexham shopping centre        
 Hexhams main shop is a big shop called
 Robbs.Robbs sells toys, food, books,  
 materal, materal telivisons,radios,   
 wine,beer,shoes,clothes and paint.    
 Robbs is a good place for shopping but
 in my opinion I would rather go to    
 Newcastle for a bigger choice of      
 things.There are lots of other food   
 shops in Hexham like Prestos,Co-op.   
 I think there should be shops for such
 things as food and D.I.Y.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
