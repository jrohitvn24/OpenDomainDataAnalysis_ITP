		<title>20DOMESDAY WORKERS IN DIPTON.</title>
		<content>{The previous 19 pages have taken three
{months to compile.This would not have 
{been possible without the work of many
{people.The 77 Junior children of Saint
{Patrick's School have researched from 
{Local Libraries,interviewed relations,
{surveyed 200 people,&amp; discussed with  
{one another &amp; their teachers,to arrive
{at this final account.}So we publicly}
 thank Miss M.Emerson &amp; Junior 3,Mrs.M.
 Richardson &amp; Junior 2,Mrs.C.O'Sullivan
 &amp; Junior 1,Mrs.M.Pinkerton for the    
 typing of the Survey,the Parents for  
 their support,&amp; the Headmaster,Mr.H.  
 Bartrope, for co-ordinating &amp; editing 
 all the work.{The only regret of the  
{editor was that he had to omit so much
{information due to lack of space.     
                                       
 However,we believe this to be a true  
 &amp; accurate account of life,in &amp; around
 Dipton in 1985.                       </content>
