 In the Bulls Cross area there is a    
 neighbourhood watch scheme, in which  
 neighbours keep a close watch on their
 area. People participating in the     
 scheme have a badge in their windows. 
 They keep a look out for things like  
 robberies, people acting suspiciously 
 e.g. prowlers, and other nuisances    
 like glue sniffers - a great problem  
 nowadays in our area.                 
                                       
 Although there is no police station in
 Bulls Cross, the nearest one being in 
 Enfield Town, the local policeman who 
 patrols this area is in constant touch
 with his police station by means of   
 personal radio or the car radios.
