		<title>17FARMING</title>
		<content>     Although the major part of the    
 area is given over to commercial      
 farming much is being done to preserve
 animal and plant life.                
{1.}Farmers using insecticides do not  
 spray the outside 5m of crop fields   
 so that insects can breed to feed the 
 young pheasants.                      
{2.}The C.W.S Estate and Hatley Hall   
 are both planting thousands of trees  
 to replace those lost through age or  
 disease. 4,000 have already been      
 planted at Hatley Hall.               
{3.}Woods are being coppiced in parts  
 and undergrowth cleared to accomodate 
 the growth of wild plants.            
{4.}Some woodlands are being left to   
 accomodate the herds of deer.         
{5.}Deer shooting is not allowed on    
 either estate.                        
{6.}The Hunt is restricted to certain  
 areas.                                </content>
