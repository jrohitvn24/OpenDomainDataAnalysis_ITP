 The age os most houses is 1930-1940.  
 In Upminster most of the houses are   
 semi-detached with three bedrooms.    
 The price range is 50,000 to 100,000  
 pounds.  The most expensive road in   
 Upminster is Little Gaynes Lane.  The 
 gardens are about 35-70 metres long.  
 Because Upminster is beginning to     
 become a bigger town and they want to 
 build more houses, the gardens will   
 get smaller.  More people want to move
 in than move out.  The most popular   
 houses in Upmnster are Tudor with a   
 garage.
