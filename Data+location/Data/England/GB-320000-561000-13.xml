   Bowness Primary school had 101      
 pupils aged 4+ on 1/9/1984 to 11+ in  
 July 1985.  Parents, Buses (Ribble or 
 Private operators) or Taxis bring them
 from all parts of the Parish. Most    
 pupils have lunch cooked in the school
 kitchen. Some bring packed lunch.     
 There are 5 teachers and also visiting
 specialists for Violin and for Special
 Educational Needs.The school is a very
 happy place with much parental        
 involvement. At 11, pupils go to      
 Nelson Thomlinson, Wigton, for their  
 Secondary Education up to 16 or to    
 Sixth Form level.  Roman Catholic     
 children attend school in Wigton or   
 Carlisle, as do children whose parents
 want them educated privately. The     
 Handicapped have Special schools in   
 Wigton or Carlisle.{CONTRIBUTORS P.20 </content>
