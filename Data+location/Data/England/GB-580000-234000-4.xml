		<title>04       Farm Survey</title>
		<content> Within the 3x4 kilometre area of the  
 Maplesteads and Wickham St.Paul there 
 are 4 predominant farms:-    ACRES    
     Byham Hall,Parks Farm     760     
     Chelmshoe                 570     
     Moat Farm                 550     
     Lucking and Monks Farm    550     
 Visits were made by 6-8 children      
 from St.Giles during May,June and     
 July.Prior to the visit,each owner was
 asked to complete a questionnaire     
 covering: arable,livestock,farm       
 machinery,woodland,game and water     
 besides a general introduction.In     
 addition a detailed field map was     
 completed indicating the 1985 crop    
 plans.These surveys showed            
 conclusively that besides one major   
 beef cattle herd on Chelmshoe and a   
 large table bird (chickens) throughput
 at Lucking, arable farming is the main
 business.                             </content>
