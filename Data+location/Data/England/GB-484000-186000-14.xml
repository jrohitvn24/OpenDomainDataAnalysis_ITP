		<content>{Introduction                          
{   Marlow Bottom}lies in a dry valley 
 and is about two miles long. Of the   
 area about 66% is greenland and 17% is
 woodland but it is disappearing       
 rapidly.                              
                                       
     It is quite a close community of  
 3000 houses with a dozen small shops  
 including a Post Office and two       
 building societies. It has a public   
 house and a private members club.     
 There are two churches and a village  
 hall which is used for a variety of   
 activities.                           
                                       
     There is a small industrial estate
 which employs about 200 people. Much  
 of the surrounding woodland is        
 encompassed by the greenbelt.
