{Hoofield Church of England(Controlled)
{School was built in 1880.}The building
 has changed little since this time    
 although some alteration of space has 
 taken place, and over half of the     
 present school population of 93 is now
 housed in two temporary, mobile       
 classrooms. Plans to re-model the     
 school have been proposed and it is   
 hoped that these plans will secure the
 future of the school into the 21st.   
 century!                              
                                       
   Pupils were originally drawn from   
 the official 'catchment' zone,        
 comprising of the parishes of Duddon, 
 Clotton, Burton and Hoofield.  Today  
 over half the pupils come from other  
 parishes including those of Tarporley,
 Tarvin, Oscroft and Willington. At    
 present there are five teachers.      </content>
