		<title>03THE FOSTER BROTHERS</title>
		<content> In 1830 two Foster brothers started a 
 worsted business, distributing the    
 work to hand-loom weavers in their own
 homes. In February 1831{Benjamin      
{Foster}aged 22, was returning over the
 moors with cloth when his horse and   
 cart fell in a ditch during a bad snow
 storm. Struggling along on foot he    
 fell and later died. His faithful dog 
 Shep was still with his master when   
 found by rescuers next day. This is   
 recalled on Benjamin's gravestone in  
 the Wesleyan graveyard.               
 Despite misfortune with gale and fire 
 damage{a new spinning mill and        
{warehouse }was built in 1857,         
 employing over 1,500 people.          
 The Foster family, living at Waterloo 
 and Whiteshaw, built many cottages,   
 supplied gas and donated generously to
 the village.                          
                                       </content>
