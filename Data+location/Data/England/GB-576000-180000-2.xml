		<title>02BMX NATIONAL BIKE RACE</title>
		<content>{                                      
  When I arrive at a race venue, we    
 unload the bike and go to be          
 scrutineered. Then I usually have a   
 practice on the race course itself.   
 Sometimes we have to change the       
 gearing on the bike, and my Dad       
 usually does that. Once the bike is   
 set up then we're ready to race.      
  There are normally 8 in a race. We   
 are allocated our start positions in  
 all our 3 races,then we start. We put 
 our front wheels against the start    
 gate, then when the gate is lowered,  
 we are away! To qualify for the semi  
 final, you must do better than 5th.   
 Once in the semi then you must be 4th 
 or better to be in the Final.         
 Positions are again drawn,then the    
 Final is raced. At the moment I am    
 National Champion by 16 points. I     
 should win the U.K. Championships.    </content>
