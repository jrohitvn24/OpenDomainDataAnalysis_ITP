		<title>12CHILDREN-DIFFERENT LANGUAGES</title>
		<content> We went round our school "Whiteknights
 Junior School" to ask children if, in 
 their family, anyone could speak      
 another language other than English.  
 These were the results. Italian 6,    
 Punjabi 5, Norwegian 3, Urdu 3, Dutch 
 3, Swedish 2, Hebrew 1, Portuguese 1, 
 Samoan 1, Japanese 1 and Welsh 1.     
   Before the survey we thought that   
 more people would speak a foreign     
 language. We found that some children 
 understood other languages but did not
 speak them.These were _ French, Hausa,
 Barbadian dialect, Chinese, Trinidad  
 dialect, Malaysian, Somali, German,   
 Spanish and French.
