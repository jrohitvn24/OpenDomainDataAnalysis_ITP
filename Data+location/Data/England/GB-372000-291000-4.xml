 The hall was built between 1860 and   
 1865 for Mr.Pritchard , a solicitor in
 London,who, in the 1850's came to     
 Bridgnorth to rid himseif of an       
 illness. In the 1860's he asked for a 
 house to be built on an estate called 
 Stanmore.The house would be called    
 Stanmore Hall. Whilst living there    
 Mr. Pritchard became M.P. for         
 Bridgnorth. When Mr. Pritchard died,  
 Lady La Boucher took over the         
 hall.Locally, she also owned Dudmaston
 Hall,so she asked for a private path  
 to be made from Stanmore to Dudmaston 
 Hall for her private use alone. This  
 beautiful classic style building is   
 situated in woodland high above the   
 Severn Valley. Its grounds graced by  
 peacocks and a variety of wild life.
