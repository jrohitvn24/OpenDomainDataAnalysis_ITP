		<title>16A University Head of Dept.</title>
		<content> I arrive at 8.55 am to do my work as  
 Head of the History Department.  From 
 9am to 10 am I answer as many letters 
 as I can.  At 10 I have a tutorial for
 an hour with 6 students.  At 11 I do  
 some paperwork and perhaps see        
 students about their problems or work.
  At 12 I lecture about 19th and 20th  
 century Europe in the lecture theatre.
  At 1 pm I have lunch and perhaps a   
 swim in the university pool.  At 2 I  
 have an afternoon tutorial followed by
 more administrative work.  I see more 
 students and around 5.30pm I go home. 
 I do about one hour research a day if 
 I have time.  On Fridays I try to do  
 my own research but altogether I have 
 less free time than my colleagues.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
