		<content>{Traffic Survey On The Chester Road on 
{Monday the 10th June 1985 between     
{9.20a.m and 9.35a.m.                  
                                       
 On Monday we did the same kind        
 of survey but it was in the morning. I
 worked with Jonathan Stear again we   
 did lorries and vans going south.     
 There was fourty four. There was more 
 in the second one we did because in   
 the morning most people are going to  
 work. There were a lot of cars going  
 south because that is the way to      
 Birmingham and a lot of people in     
 Streetly work in Birmingham.
