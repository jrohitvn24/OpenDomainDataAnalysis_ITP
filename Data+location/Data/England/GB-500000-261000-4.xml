		<content>      The Parish Council, consisting of
 nine local residents, reflecting the  
 views and needs of local people on all
 Parish matters, meets regularly once a
 month.  It is concerned with the day  
 to day running of the village, which  
 includes arranging for the grassed    
 areas around the village to be kept   
 cut, maintenance of footpaths, street 
 lighting, the brook and the           
 allotments. The Parish Council has an 
 annual precept of about Â£4000 and this
 is administered by the Clerk whose    
 salary is around Â£700 per annum.  He  
 is the only paid member of the        
 Parish Council.                       
      A Parochial Church Council, also 
 elected from the congregation, runs   
 All Saints Church affairs.
