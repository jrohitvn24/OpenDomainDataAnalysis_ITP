		<title>01Introduction:rural parishes</title>
		<content> This block takes in large sections of 
 three parishes: Acton Beauchamp,      
 Stanford Bishop, and Suckley,  a small
 part of Cradley,and also small        
 sections of land without houses in    
 Evesbatch and Bishops Frome. The popu-
 lation is  roughly 170 adults living  
 in 80 houses. Much of the area lies   
 along a ridge which looks south-east  
 to the Malvern Hills, south to May    
 Hill, west to the Black Mountains, and
 north to Bromyard Downs, Abberley     
 Hills, and the hills of south         
 Shropshire. The area contains  many   
 trees but few woods, the fields are   
 comparatively small and most hedges   
 remain in place. There are no villages
 and only one hamlet of nine houses at 
 Acton Green. It is very quiet except  
 when the peace is shattered by        
 aircraft flying very low over the     
 chimney tops.                         </content>
