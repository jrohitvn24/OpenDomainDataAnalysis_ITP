		<title>14EDUCATION IN KIRKBY LONSDALE</title>
		<content> Education is of long standing in the  
 Kirkby Lonsdale area.In 1591 a small, 
 free grammar school,called{Queen      
{Elizabeth School,}was founded on Mill 
 Brow for local boys.In 1846,after many
 fluctuations in its fortunes,it moved 
 to its present site at Springfield    
 House.From 1978 it changed from a     
 grammar into a comprehensive school   
 and by 1985 is fully{comprehensive.}It
 contains 650 boys and girls between   
 the ages of 11 and 19.These pupils    
 come from Kirkby and other surrounding
 villages,as well as having places for 
 80 boarders from other areas.The{C of 
{E's National School}was built in the  
 1850s and now is overcrowded due to   
 the closure of the primary schools at 
 Lupton and Barbon.Building started on 
 a new primary school in 1985 opposite 
 Queen Elizabeth School and will be    
 opened in 1986.                       </content>
