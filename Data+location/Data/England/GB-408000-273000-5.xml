		<content> The main industry in the area is      
 farming.Manor, Rumbush, Kidpile. The  
 Poplars and Heath Farms are all farmed
 by the same person, in total 12000    
 acres.                                
     Eight thousand acres are used for 
 growing wheat and cereal and four     
 thousand for grassland to supply the  
 livestock with food.At present there  
 are 232 sheep and 357 lambs, 120      
 cattle and 60 pigs which are kept     
 purely for meat and wool.             
     {Science and Technology}have      
 greatly influenced farming in the     
 eighties, many different fertilizers  
 and sprays are used to encourage a    
 growth and a richer harvest. Times to 
 sow and reap are carefully predicted  
 and monitored. Machines to reduce     
 labour and increase economics are     
 constantly being developed.Government 
 politics and the E.E.C determine cost.</content>
