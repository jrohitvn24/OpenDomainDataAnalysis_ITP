		<content> AT OUR SCHOOL WE DO ALL OUR EXAMS IN  
 THE SAME WEEK. WE DO THEM IN OUR      
 DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS DEPENDING ON WHAT
 THE SUBJECT IS.IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO   
 START REVISION SOME WEEKS BEFORE AND  
 TO MAKE A ROTA IN WHICH YOU REVISE    
 ABOUT TWO SUBJECTS AN EVENING.THIS IS 
 HARD WORK, BUT IT IS ALL WORTH WHILE. 
 WE HAVE EXAMS IN ALL OUR SUBJECTS,    
 APART FROM P.E.(PHYSICAL EDUCATION).  
 IN EXAMS THERE ARE STRICT RULES. YOU  
 MUST ALWAYS BE QUIET AND DON'T TALK,  
 ELSE YOU MAY BE DISQUALIFIED OR LOSE  
 MARKS. YOU MUST NOT CHEAT IN EXAMS,   
 WHEN WE HAVE AN EXAM THERE IS ALWAYS A
 TEACHER TO SUPERVISE. WHEN EXAMS ARE  
 ON IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO BE QUIET WHEN 
 YOU GO AROUND THE SCHOOL,ESPECIALLY   
 WHEN THE O AND A LEVEL EXAMS ARE ON.  
 ALL THE EXAMS ARE DEVISED BY THE      
 TEACHERS OR THE HEAD OF DEPARTMENT.
