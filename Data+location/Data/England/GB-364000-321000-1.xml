		<title>01INTRODUCTION:  GREAT BOLAS</title>
		<content> Orleton Park School surveyed the block
 4 by 3 km from grid ref. 0364 0321.   
 The main land use is agricultural and 
 the two main villages are Eaton Upon  
 Tern and Great Bolas.                 
   The area is very sparcely populated 
 for there seems to be only one pub and
 one church to serve the area.         
   The River Tern and the River Meese  
 drain the area and they meander from  
 North to South and East to West.      
   On our first survey of Great Bolas  
 most of us found it difficult to      
 follow our maps as the footpaths shown
 on the maps were non existent.        
   One man,Mr.J. Faulkner Irving at one
 time used to own the whole village of 
 Eaton Upon Tern. He and his brother   
 planted a row of chestnut trees to    
 celebrate the end of the war in 1945. 
 The industry of the area consists of  
 two things the Agriculture,Airfield.  </content>
