		<title>06WYNYARD GROVE</title>
		<content> Wynyard Grove is on the edge of Bishop
 Auckland. There are lots of vehicles  
 in our street especially parked cars. 
 There are two or three old folks in   
 the street who we don't see very      
 often and one or two odd people.      
 For instance the family across the    
 road from us. The man comes out at    
 about 10pm. and puts some carpet over 
 his car engine covered with papers and
 at about 8am. he comes out and blows  
 the tyres up with a footpump. All the 
 houses in our street were built about 
 20 years ago and are semi-detached    
 exept for the first one. Overall I    
 like my house and street and would not
 like to move. Next to our house is an 
 old railway line where I go for walks 
 on sunny days. There is a field beside
 the line where I play football and    
 cricket during the school holidays.
