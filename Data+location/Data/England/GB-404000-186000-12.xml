		<content> Sadly many of the ponds in the fields 
 have been filled in, but there is one 
 which has been cleared out by the     
 Wiltshire Trust for Conservation in   
 1982 and now provides homes for       
 frogs, newts and other water loving   
 creatures. There is a small lake with 
 a stream running from it, both of     
 which are polluted by silage effluent,
 there                                 
 are wild duck nesting around the lake.
 There are many footpaths and          
 bridleways in this section the total  
 length being about 43km not all are in
 regular use. The hedges have been     
 largely left intact and at least one  
 farmer practises organic farming which
 is allowing many of the grasses and   
 flowers to flourish here.
