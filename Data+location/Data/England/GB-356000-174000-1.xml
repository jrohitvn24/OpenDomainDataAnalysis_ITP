		<content>  Our area is mainly residential. The  
 bulk of the houses were built either  
 at the turn of the century or between 
 the wars.Throughout the area houses   
 have gone from single family units to 
 flats and bedsits and back again and  
 the process still flows.              
  There are contrasts within the over  
 all pattern.{Stoke Bishop}in the north
 west has large distinguished detached 
 houses and University halls of        
 residence around the open area of the 
 Downs. {St.Pauls}in the south east has
 small terraces and new council flats  
 and is slowly recovering from city    
 centre planning blight and neglect.   
  The two main shopping streets run    
 north/south.{Gloucester Road}in the   
 east serves{Horfield,Ashley Down,     
{Bishopston}and{St.Andrews}while{White-
{ladies Road}serves{Clifton,Cotham}and{
{Redland.Westbury Park}has its own.    </content>
