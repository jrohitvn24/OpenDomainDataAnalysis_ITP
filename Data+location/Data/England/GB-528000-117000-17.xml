		<content>   We play the usual games, football,  
 netball, cricket and rounders. During 
 the Summer we play a special Sussex   
 game{Stoolball.}The rules are very    
 simple. There are two wickets with a  
 distance of seven metres between them.
 One side bowls and the other bats,    
 runs are scored alternately, and the  
 person whose wicket is hit is out.    
 They can also be caught or run out.   
   In the{playground}we play Dungeons  
 and Dragons, Dungeons and Dragons     
 chess, Hunt the Fox, Red Rover and    
 British Bulldog.The boys often play   
 football,while the girls usually skip,
 talk, play hopscotch or practice gym. 
   Burgess Hill has many computer shops
 and people buy games to use on their  
 home computers. We are expected to    
 make use of our computers to support  
 the work we do in school.This includes
