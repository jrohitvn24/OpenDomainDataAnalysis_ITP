		<title>07A HOUSE IN FORE ST. TOPSHAM</title>
		<content> My grandparents' house is very old. It
 used to be a market and then a police 
 station. The house belongs to the     
 Market Trust and my grandparents rent 
 it. My family have lived there since  
 my great grandmother's time - I lived 
 there when I was a baby.              
 The house is painted light green and  
 has a very big door. There are two    
 windows downstairs and three upstairs,
 but one of these has been blocked up. 
 It has got two cells which the        
 prisoners used to be put in and there 
 is a stone bed with a stone pillow    
 inside. The cells have a large heavy  
 wooden door with a little peep hole   
 where they used to put the prisoners' 
 food through.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
