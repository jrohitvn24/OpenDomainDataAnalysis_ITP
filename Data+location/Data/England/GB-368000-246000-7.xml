		<content>   Mr. Brigdan grows apples, pears,    
 strawberries and raspberries, which he
 sells to wholesalers, supermarkets and
 hypermarkets.  Ferlilizers are applied
 in the early spring in granule form by
 a groundsprayer.  He has Bramleys,    
 Coxes, Worcesters, Discoveries,       
 Lambourne and Spartan.  Twenty local  
 women pick these in the autumn.  The  
 apples are packed, sized and          
 delivered.  A new product has been    
 called Apple Dew (apple juice).  They 
 have also dabbled in cider. There were
 5 acres of Williams and Conners pears.
   The orchards were on a slope for    
 drainage.  The fruits are kept in the 
{cold store.} The size of the apples   
 most common to Pullen's Farm is 60mm. 
 The size that they prefer is 70mm.    
 There is a little trouble by{squirrels
 but{rabbits}are often eating the bark 
 off the apple and pear trees.         </content>
