		<title>10N.F.Council:Complaints</title>
		<content> The New Forest District Council at    
 Lyndhurst receives a variety of       
 complaints mainly concerned with      
 planning or housing matters. To make a
 complaint you can go about it in 2    
 ways:-One way is to write to the chief
 executive who in turn will write to   
 the officer in charge of the          
 department concerned and hopefully the
 matter will be settled.   Another way 
 probably the more effective, is to    
 write to your Member of Parliament for
 your area.   He will then correspond  
 with the chief executive.   If the    
 reply does not satisfy, he will get in
 touch with the ombudsman who will look
 into the case, personally.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
