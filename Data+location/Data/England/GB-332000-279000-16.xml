		<title>16CLUNTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Mary's Clunton is a neat church   
 built of grey stone in the decorated  
 style, consisting of a continuous nave
 and chancel with a small north porch  
 and western bell gable.               
     There are two sedilia and a       
 piscina in the south wall. The font is
 small and octagonal. The roof is of   
 the trussed rafter form with seven    
 cants. There are thirteen wooden pews 
 and two choir stalls. Music is        
 provided by a harmonium which is      
 played at each service by the organist
 from Clunbury.                        
     The regular congregation is small 
 but loyal. One service is held each   
 Sunday with additional services held  
 at Easter, Harvest and Christmas.     
 Brass cleaning and flowers are        
 done by the ladies of the village.    
 Chaired by the vicar, the church has  
 it's own commitee to run the church.  </content>
