		<title>19A Day in the Life of Sylvia</title>
		<content>Sylvia gets up at 6am,and has a cup of 
tea.After that she does her milk round,
in Hulme Village.She comes back and has
her breakfast.                         
    Then she feeds her 6 pigs and her  
10 calves,and cleans them out. She     
comes back into the house and washes   
the breakfast dishes.Then the post     
comes and she opens it.After she has   
washed up she cleans the house and     
then she prepares the dinner for two   
men ,her daughter,herself and her      
Aunty across the road who is very ill. 
    Sylvia has 10 cats ,because people 
come to her farm and just dump their   
cats there, deserting them.She takes   
them into her house and feeds them.She 
has a wash and gets changed to watch   
television.Apart from all this she is  
very busy answering the phone all day.
