		<content>  Our school is{Oakfield C.E. (Aided)  
{Primary School}which is in the parish 
 of, and has connections with St John's
 Church.                               
  As well as being a{Church School,}we 
 serve a local catchment area and      
 currently have{174 pupils,}boys and   
 girls aged from rising 5 to 9 years,  
 in{six classes}with six teachers and  
 a head teacher.                       
  The old part of the school, now a    
 hall, kitchen and offices, was built  
 in 1878. Five classrooms were added   
 in 1970 and a mobile classroom in     
 1973.  There is one playground and    
 many grassy areas where pets are      
 housed. There is a small area for     
 nature studies which contains a wide  
 variety of trees and a spring fed     
 pond. There are no playing fields so  
 we travel by Authority bus to Little  
 Appley field 1 km away.               </content>
