 There are two large new houses being  
 built in the village centre.We        
 interviewed Mr.Bob Bridger who is     
 building these houses.He told us that 
 before he could start he had to get   
 planning permission from the local    
 council.Local people could object,and 
 the parish council was consulted.The  
 council insisted that the architect   
 drew plans to fit the surroundings.   
 When this was done the council        
 approved the plans and gave           
 permission to build the houses.Once   
 the plans were passed-the foundations 
 are dug.They are dug one metre deep   
 and outlined with stakes,then it is   
 filled with concrete.The houses are   
 built with thermal blocks and         
 bricks.The house has about 15,000     
 bricks,they are locally made bricks.  </content>
