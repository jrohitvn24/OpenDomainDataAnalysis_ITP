		<title>01Part of Piddle Valley</title>
		<content> This area of Dorset consists of 3     
 isolated farms with cottages combined 
 with 4 small villages - Affpuddle,    
 Briantspuddle, Throop, and Turners    
 Puddle, which are in the valley of the
 river Piddle which meanders throught  
 the southern part of this block.  The 
 A35 trunk road bisects the centre of  
 the block which takes traffic from    
 Poole and Wimbourne to Dorchester via 
 Bere Regis.  Farming is the main      
 industry in the area being a mixture  
 of cultivated pastures and rough      
 grazing for fresian (milk) cattle and 
 sheep, which mainly graze on the      
 fields to the north of the A35. A farm
 shop can be found on the road selling 
 local produce. The 4 villages are     
 unspoilt and consist of thatched      
 cottages, stone churches and are      
 linked by narrow country lanes        
 bordered by hedgerows.                </content>
