		<title>17SHOPPING FROM BARNSTON</title>
		<content> During{a one hour survey}at the local 
 shops by Heswall Hills Railway Station
 it was found that many people visited 
 these shops for forgotten items or for
 items which were needed immediately.  
 They shopped for bread regularly and  
 liked to deal with the local butcher. 
 Limited choice of goods and higher    
 prices meant that a "big shop" was    
 conducted elsewhere on a regular      
 basis.                                
{A wider survey concluded that main    
{destinations for the weekly shop were 
                                       
 Heswall   {53% }       Chester   {5.3%
 Prenton   {16% }       Neston    {2.7%
