		<content> "Had" is a very energetic game, quite 
 the opposite of {Space Invaders.}You  
 gather round in a circle and put your 
 foot in the middle. The person in     
 charge of the game chants a rhyme that
 has been handed down by tradition to  
 see who is "on it". In other words to 
 see who is going to be catching. For  
 example one rhyme is :-               
    Eeny, meeny, miney, mo,            
    Catch a tiger by the toe,          
    If it screams let it go,           
    Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.            
 The person on whom the word "mo" lands
 is out so he or she are not "on it"   
 and so on. The last person to have the
 word "mo" land on him is "on it". He  
 runs after you and if he touches and  
 shouts "had", he is released and you  
 are "on it". This goes on until       
 everybody is tired out and stops!
