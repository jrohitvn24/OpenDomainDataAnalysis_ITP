		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> I am a ten year old girl.I live in a  
 small town called St Day.My house is a
 four bedroomed house.I get up at 7.45 
 a.m. and after breakfast I walk to    
 school, meeting my friends on the way.
 We have a play in the playground and  
 school begins at 8.55.After Assembly  
 we have Maths, followed by playtime,  
 then Spelling or English till lunch at
 12.25p.m.                             
 In the afternoon we have Art and P.E. 
 After school I go home at 3.20 and get
 changed.I then go out to play or help 
 Mum by washing up,tidying my bedroom  
 or anything else.Then when I've       
 finished I'm allowed out to play.I    
 come in at 5 o'clock to have my       
 tea.Then I stay in and watch          
 Television or a video.I go to bed at 9
 o'clock and I sometimes read before I 
 go to sleep.
