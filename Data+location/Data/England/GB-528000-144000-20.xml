		<content>{Philips Research Laboratories}in      
 Redhill employ{500}people.They work on
 many aspects of{electronic research.  
 They are investigating ways of making 
{thin television sets}so that they can 
 be hung on the wall and also trying to
 improve the quality of the picture.   
 Another area of work is to find more  
 applications for the{Compact Disc     
 which is now replacing the gramophone 
 record.One possible use is as an      
{electronic dictionary}which will show 
 the meaning of a word on screen and   
 also pronounce the word.              
 Philips are also trying to make       
 computers appear more intelligent by  
 writing programmes which will help the
 engineer to determine what is wrong   
 when the equipment breaks down.       
 Another area is finding ways of       
 improving{radio communication}between 
 vehicles for motorists, police etc.   </content>
