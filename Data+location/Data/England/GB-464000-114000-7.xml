		<content>{SPELTHAM DOWN}is a site of unimproved 
 grassland at the centre of{Hambledon.}
 Five footpaths cross the down         
 including the{Wayfarer's Way.}In 1984 
 the land was offered for sale to be   
 split into small plots for pony       
 grazing. The Down is valued as a      
 landscape feature and it was felt that
 fences and huts would ruin this.The   
 site also has recreational value and  
 an importance for nature conservation.
 It has a typical chalk flora and      
 provides a habitat that is threatened 
 nationally. A committee was formed to 
 raise the funds for the{National Trust
 to buy the site and tree preservation 
 orders were requested. Â£26000 were    
 raised by the villagers in 3 months   
 and the{Countryside Commission}gave   
 Â£4000.The site was bought by the Trust
 for Â£40000.The land will be managed to
 preserve its present character.       </content>
