		<content>    In our area the main type of       
farming is dairy farming.After going to
the farms and questioning the owners we
found this out.Sheep farming is the    
next most common.                      
    The reasons for it mainly being    
daily farming is because the farms are 
small and havn't got so much land which
limits the farmer to what type of      
farming he can do,another reason is    
that if they produced beef there would 
not be enough profit made on them.     
    Most farms are built on hillsides  
and so if they did produce beef cattle 
the meat would be worked off on the cow
because of all the walking up and down 
the fields they would be doing.The     
fields therefore ared for grazing the  
cattle in,and in the summer the farmers
mow the fields and use it for          
silage,hay or straw using different    
methods to produce each or either one. </content>
