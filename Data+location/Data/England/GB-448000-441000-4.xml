		<title>04JONATHAN'S TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> At 07.30,when I hear the milkman      
 singing a funny little tune .I go into
 my brother's bedroom and wake him up. 
 I go down stairs, open the curtains,  
 have a little talk with the goldfish, 
 Goldie ,then read my football book.   
 My mum calls me for my breakfast. I   
 have Special K and coffee.After       
 breakfast I clean my teeth.Then I go  
 for my friends.At school we play      
 football until the whistle goes at    
 09.00.                                
   School begins at 09.00 and ends     
 at 15.45.                             
   After school I change into my old   
 clothes then at 16.15 call for Richard
 and we go into the field to play      
 football. At about 17.30 I have my tea
 then watch T.V. for about 2 hours,    
 read 1 hour and listen to a record. At
 21.00 go up stairs brush my teeth     
 get undressed and get into bed.       </content>
