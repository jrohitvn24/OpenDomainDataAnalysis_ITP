		<content> The CB (Citizen Band Radio) is one of 
 the best means of communication for   
 all types of people, particularly     
 disabled or elderly people who cannot 
 communicate face to face. There are   
 many types of CB: Harvard, Binatone,  
 Homebase and even the illegal Dx'er.  
 The language of CB is totally         
 different ffom our normal language.   
 They use numbers to represent words.  
 e.g. 10-1 means you are crazy, 10-10  
 means goodbye. There are 40 channels  
 available for use but channel 9 is for
 emergency only. The illegal Dx'er     
 interferes with the police,fire       
 services, ambulances and the armed    
 forces. You can reach anywhere in the 
 world with the Dx'er but the range of 
 the legal CB's is usually about ten   
 miles.
