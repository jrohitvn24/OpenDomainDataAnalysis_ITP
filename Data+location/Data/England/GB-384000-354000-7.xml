		<content>AT SCHOOL I PLAY SKIPPING. TO PLAY     
SKIPPING YOU NEED ONE OR TWO PEOPLE.   
YOU GET THE ROPE AND TAKE IT OVER YOUR 
HEAD AND JUMP IT, IF IT'S JUST ONE     
PERSON, BUT IF IT'S TWO PEOPLE ONE     
PERSON HOLDS THE ROPE AND TAKES IT     
OVER THEIR HEAD AND AT THE SAME TIME   
OVER THE OTHER PERSONS HEAD AND THEY   
BOTH TRY TO JUMP IT. IF YOU DO BACKWARD
SKIPPING YOU HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU   
AND TAKE IT OVER YOUR HEAD AND JUMP IT.
IF IT IS TWO PEOPLE THE PERSON WHO     
HOLDS THE ROPE HAS IT IN FRONT OF THEM 
AND TAKES IT OVER HIS HEAD AND JUMPS IT
AND THE OTHER PERSON JUMPS IT TOO AND  
THE OTHER PERSON TAKES IT OVER THEIR   
HEAD AND SO ON.
