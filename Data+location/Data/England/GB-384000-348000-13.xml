		<title>13TRADE PORT VALE MARKET.</title>
		<content>   On 12th March 1976 an open air      
market was opened on the car park of   
Port Vale Footrball Ground.Between     
March and July 1976 34 traders selling 
wet fish,greengrocery,fresh meat and   
various cut price merchandise had      
stalls on the market.At first the      
market was the subject of much         
opposition.In Nov. 1976 the City       
Council refused planning permission for
the market to continue,on the basis of 
inadequate facilities being provided   
for the market.However,much of the     
opposition to the market came from the 
traders of Burslem district shopping   
 centre who felt that the market would 
attract customers away from the town   
centre shops.                          
            In Feb.1977 the City       
Council granted planning permission for
a limited period,following a public    
inquiry in Stoke.                      </content>
