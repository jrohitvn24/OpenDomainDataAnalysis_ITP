 partly industrial. There are two      
 canals which meet near the centre of  
 the square. South and West of the     
 canals is a large housing estate which
 leads into the Eastern edge of        
 Burberry Grange estate, built in 1983.
  In the North West is the{British Rail
{Steel Terminal.}Further North is      
 mostly waste land, and includes the   
 recently closed{Patent Shaft factory.}

 large employer in the area, lives on  
 in the name of the local public house 
{The Shaft.}Near to the works is the   
 grave of{William Arthur Burton}who was
 born in 1925 and committed suicide in 
 1956. The factory he owned is named
