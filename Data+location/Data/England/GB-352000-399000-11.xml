 limestone or granite and bitumen,they 
 have their own quarries for stone. At 
 each site they have two sets of       
 machinery,in case of breakdowns.To buy
 all the machinery to_day would cost

  The men employed come from all over, 
 but mainly from Liverpool, Wigan area,
 there still being a few with homes in 
 Ireland. A motorway costs Â£1,000,000  
 to tarmac one mile and it takes two   
 and a half weeks to complete the mile.</content>
