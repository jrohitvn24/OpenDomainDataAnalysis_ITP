		<content> In 1915 life was quite different      
 because of the fact that there was no 
 electricity and no water system so    
 everyone would have to go to the a    
 well but in the summer the wells would
 dry up and they would have to go to   
 the local pond or stream.probaly the  
 most noticable change in Dallington is
 the opening of the new school in      
 1915.The new school was opened because
 it could not take such large numbers  
 of children.There has only been one   
 major accident in the village between 
 1915-1985 and that was when a horse   
 and cart was traveling down Prinkle   
 hill layden with stones.The driver    
 tried to stop the horse.The horse     
 stopped but the cart kept on going and
 he fell off and got caught in the     
 wheel and was draged to the bottom and
 was killed.                           
                                       </content>
