		<title>13HOUSING IN KINGS LANGLEY</title>
		<content> There is intensive housing on either  
 side of the High Street (A41).Private 
 housing predominates on western side. 
 At the northern and southern ends are 
 tree _ lined Council estates. Advent  
 of by_pass on high ground further west
 coupled with Council policy to        
 increase housing density in Kings     
 Langley may, it is feared, lead to    
 peripheral development changing the   
 character of village. On eastern side 
 housing is mixed. Denser developments 
 are becoming a feature of the valley, 
 west of canal. Pressures generated by 
 construction of the M25 may lead to   
 erosion of the Green Belt around      
 village. Some urbanisation is         
 inevitable. The fear is of further    
 industrialization in the valley.
