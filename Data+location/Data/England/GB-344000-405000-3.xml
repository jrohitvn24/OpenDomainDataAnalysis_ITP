     The population grew rapidly from  
 760 in 1851 to 5699 by 1901.Unhappily,
 the seams were soon worked out and the
 area fell into decline again by 1950. 
                                       
    The biggest change in              
 Skelmersdale's history came in 1960   
 when plans were announced to make the 
 town the centre for Lancashire's first
 New Town.A Development Corporation was
 set up and huge amounts of money were 
 made available. As a result of this   
 new life was given to a nearly        
 derelict area.                        
                                       
    Here are some important dates in   
 the latest history of the town:       
 1962- Development Corporation set up. 
 1964-Basic Plan approved.             
 1964-1st New House occupied.          
 1980-M58 Link opened.                 </content>
