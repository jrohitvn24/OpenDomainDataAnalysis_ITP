		<title>13  IMPROVING THE AREA.</title>
		<content> Of the 129 people questioned 102,(79%)
 said that the amenities of the area   
 were reasonable to good.              
                                       
  {Ways of improving the amenities.    
                                       
 The most frequent suggestion was for a
 much improved public transport system.
                                       
  The second most frequent suggestion  
 was for more facilities for the       
 children,particularly the youth of the
 area.                                 
                                       
  For the block,excluding Saltwood,many
 people stated there was a need for a  
 local doctor and a local chemist shop.
                                       
  Many suggestions ,in fact,concerned  
 problems outside the block and the top
 one was a plea for more large shops   
 like Littlewoods or B.H.S.            </content>
