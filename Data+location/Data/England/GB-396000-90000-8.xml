		<title>08TURLIN MOOR RECLAMATION</title>
		<content>{                                      
 Several years ago, Poole Generating   
 Station proposed to dump 50,000 tons  
 of ash a year into the sea on the     
 Poole coast. The local authorities    
 were afraid that this might harm the  
 fish so the Corporation bought 82     
 acres land at Turlin Moor to use as   
 playing fields and allowed the CEGB   
 to dump the ash on it up to a         
 depth of 12 feet.  By 1959, 29 acres  
 of Turlin Moor had been reclaimed and 
 14.5 acres were laid out as playing   
 fields.                               
 When the power station changed to     
 burning oil, the ash supply stopped.  
 The reclamation was continued by the  
 dumping of rubbish from the           
 destructor.
