		<content>{INTERVIEW WITH A CHESTERFIELD VICAR.  
   As a vicar in the town of the famous
{Crooked Spire,}my responsibility in   
 Brampton is to be the{"Man of God".}I 
 must try to bring God's love to all I 
 meet and to all who seek it. I must   
 always try to remember that in my     
 dealings with other people, I am      
 representing Jesus Christ, our Lord   
 and Saviour.{Places of worship}are    
 important because the family of God   
 witness together in fellowship. They  
 unite so that the church becomes a    
 "home" for those who seek refuge and  
 help. Churches will best{serve the    
{needs}of people in the future by being
 homes of stability within the         
 community. People will be able to find
 recreation. The church will be a place
 of peace and quietness and people will
 continue to seek God and find Him     
 there.                                </content>
