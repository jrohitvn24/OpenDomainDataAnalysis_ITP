		<content>    {Abercairney Estate}covers 150,000 
 acres of land and is situated between 
 Perth and Crieff.  It employs 15      
 people but half of the estate is let  
 out to tenant farmers.  Employed on   
 the estate are 3 keepers, 2           
 maintenance men, 2 stock men, 4 arable
 farmers, 2 foresters and 1 office     
 person.                               
     The estate mostly makes its money 
 from{fishing}and{cattle}and{sheep     
 farming.  They used to{shoot grouse}as
 well.  Most of the woods are used for 
 timber and Christmas trees are sent to
 Edinburgh for sale.  They plant so    
 many trees every year, instead of a   
 fixed amount every time.  They plant  
 the trees very close together and when
 they are half grown they thin them out
 and use the ones they take out as     
 Christmas trees.
