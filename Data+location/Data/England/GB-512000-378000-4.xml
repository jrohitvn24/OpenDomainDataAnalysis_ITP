		<title>04Living In Wragby</title>
		<content>   I like living in Wragby because it  
 is quite small.I live in a close,so it
 is not very noisy.You would call      
 Wragby a village.It has a{church}and a
{chapel}with a Sunday School,a Market  
 Place with a few{shops}(Post          
 Office,Co-op,Stores and Flower shop,  
 Newsagent and 2 Butchers),and a{Town  
{Hall.} This is a place where anyone   
 can go.They have bingo,keep-fit,discos
 and jumble sales there.There are two  
{parks }where you can play bowls and   
 tennis and where children can         
 play.Wragby has 2{pubs,}the Turnor    
 Arms and the Adam and Eve, a{cafe}and 
 a{fish and chip shop.}There is a small
{swimming pool}at the school.          
   There are{3 or 4 small factories.}  
 My dad works at Wragby Plastics and   
 he makes plastic bowls,plates and     
 cups.{ }
