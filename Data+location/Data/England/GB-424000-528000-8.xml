		<content> Occasionaly we have a sports day in   
 the field. Last year I won the flat   
 race. I won a mint. On the Royal      
 Wedding Day we had a street party with
 sideshows and amusements. I had to go 
 in the stocks and get wet sponges     
 thrown at me. Also in the field we    
 have a power generator. We always are 
 careful to keep away from the         
 generator. At night we have a bike    
 race. I have only won once. Our houses
 were built about 100 years ago. I have
 lived in Howlish View all of my life. 
 My Mam and Dad have lived there for   
 23 years. The bottom of the street is 
 separate from the top. At the bottom  
 the road is terrible. It is all rocky 
 and bumpy. There are also a lot of    
 puddles. At the gap, half way down the
 street lots of gangs gather. That's   
 why I don't go out to play very often.
