		<content>{Gilling West C.of E.School}has        
 changed since the 1930s. The number of
 children in the village has dropped so

{eight juniors and twelve infants.     
 There are{two teachers}-the Head who  
 teaches all day,and a part-time       
 teacher who teaches the juniors in the
 mornings- and an{ancillary helper.    
 We sit at tables,in groups of four or 
 six to do our lessons.In{Maths.}we    
 work from cards,individually,and we do
 practical work. As well as{English}and
{Hand-writing,}we work on{topics-}like 
 the{Domesday Project.}We play         
{recorders}and other tuned percussion  
 instruments. We watch school          
 programmes on{television,}and we work 
 through programmes on the{computer.   
 When we are{eleven}years of age we    
 will go to{Richmond Comprehensive.
