		<content> The village is no longer as it used to
 be.Only a few of the old cottages     
 remain.My nan lives in one which is   
 over 400 years old.She always said    
 that she had a ghost in her cottage   
 but my dad never believed her until an
 ash tray flew across the room one     
 night and so he had to believe her.   
  Some of the old shops have also      
 disappeared. I remember the old       
 butcher's shop which was next door to 
 the Co-op my mum and I used to go     
 there every Monday morning but it has 
 gone now and has been converted into a
 house.There used to be a Doctor's in  
 Main Street but that has been         
 converted into an Insurance agency.   
 There was also a Post Office but that 
 too was converted into a house along  
 with Maton's shop where my mum used to
 work.They were all good shops for the 
 village but they have gone now-how sad</content>
