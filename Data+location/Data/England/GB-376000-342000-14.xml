		<title>14SMITHY COTTAGE</title>
		<content>                                       
  Mrs.Lees, who used to work in our    
school (as ancilliary assistant) lives 
in Smithy Cottage which got its name   
because at one time the blacksmith,    
Mr.Broad, used to live there. Mr and   
Mrs Foster lived there after the black-
smith and they pulled it down and then 
rebuilt it all again with the same     
bricks. The original house was built   
300 years ago, and at that time the    
roof was thatched and the walls were   
made of wattle and daub (mud). In those
days people were smaller and that is   
why the houses were smaller. There are 
fences around the windows, because when
horses were coming for new shoes, they 
poked their noses through the windows. 
The floors are at different levels as  
it is said that if thieves got in they 
would be caught off guard and the      
people inside would be ready for them. </content>
