		<content> Along the A272 is Willow Cottage, the 
 home of Layla, George &amp; Jessie who all
 attend William Penn School.  Willow   
 Cottage has an acre of land and at the
 bottom of the paddock is a tributary  
 stream to the River Adur. Next door is
 St. Julian's farm, where most of the  
 locals buy their milk." We fetch our  
 milk in the morning or the evening.   
 Opposite the old mission where my     
 friends now live is the Playing Field.
 It belongs to the Parish Council and  
 is a lovely, safe place to play.      
 Nearby is the old butcher's shop where
 my friend Tamsin lives. Willow Cottage
 is very peaceful as all the fir trees 
 hide it from the main road. A main    
 feature of the house is its tile      
 hanging. Living in Coolham is quite a 
 privilege in itself for William Penn  
 is a delightful school to work and    
 play at."                             </content>
