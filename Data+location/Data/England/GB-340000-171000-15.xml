		<title>15My Dad broke Clevedon Pier 1</title>
		<content> This is Nicola Gay (age 10) reporting.
 The date is October, 1970. I am here  
 in Clevedon to interview Mr. Robin    
 Gay, Assistant Engineer to Clevedon   
 Urban District Council. Mr. Gay, can  
 you tell me what happened this        
 morning?                              
 _Mr.Gay _ The pier is over a 100 years
 old and, for insurance purposes,has to
 be inspected every two years to check 
 that it is safe for public use. The   
 pier is tested by placing a series of 
 water_filled bags over the decking.   
 _Nicola_ At which stage did the       
 failure occur?                        
 _Mr.Gay_When we tested the final spans
 by the pier_head. We started work at  
 6.30a.m and had filled the water bags 
 by 9.30a.m. I was now ready to measure
 any up or down movement in the        
 pier (with an auto_set level).        
 _Nicola_When did you notice something?</content>
