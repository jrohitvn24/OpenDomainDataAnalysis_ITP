		<content> As Aviemore continues to develop, the 
{District Council}faces demands to     
 provide houses for{key}workers.The    
 paper recently reported that Aviemore 
 engineering firm,Highland Components, 
 had warned the Council that the       
 company's future in the village is in 
 danger if they can't provide{houses   
{for skilled workers.}The firm employs 
 29 people and manufactures parts for  
 the oil industry but expansion plans  
 which could provide a further 20 jobs 
 locally,have been held up due to the  
 loss of a skilled worker because he   
 could not get a house in the area.The 
 Council are doing all they can to     
 provide housing and are making a      
 special case to the Scottish Office   
 for the Scottish Special Housing      
 Association to provide housing in the 
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
