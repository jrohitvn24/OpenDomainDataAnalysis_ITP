		<content> The population of the area is about   
 150. It is, by Devon village          
 standards, a good mixture of age and  
 occupation. Farming is the main       
 employer, but several men work in the 
 building trades and the Combe House   
 Hotel has, of course, its staff.      
 Some of the old country trades remain 
 including those of baker,             
 cabinet-maker and game-keeper.        
 Gittisham Hill House, in the          
 North-East corner of the Block, is a  
 home for the elderly.                 
 When the craft centre has been        
 finished, more employment will be     
 available.                            
 Combe Farm includes a stud of breeding
 Arab ponies.                          
 Very few people work outside the      
 immediate locality. The village is not
 a dormitory, but has an existence in  
 its own right.                        </content>
