When we went into the library and shut 
the door we couldn't find it again     
because it looked like a book case full
of books.When we looked at them they   
had joke names like "The Carpenters    
Secret".                               
  There is a table which is special,it 
turns into some steps to reach the     
books in the top shelf.The books are   
very old.                              
  There is a garden gnome in a glass   
case.It was the first one in England.  
Sir Charles Isham brought gnomes back  
from Germany for his alpine garden.He  
believed in fairies and wrote books    
about them,but his children thought he 
was daft and when he died they smashed 
them all up except this one.
