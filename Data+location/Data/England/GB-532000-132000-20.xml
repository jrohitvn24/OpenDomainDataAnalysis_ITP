{Ruth Beattie}and{Mrs Mary Becker.     
   Miss Emy, born in Croydon, Surrey,  
 is a retired Headmistress of a local  
 Primary School. Mrs Beattie, born in  
 Cambridge, worked for the wartime RAF 
 before becoming a housewife and       
 mother. Mrs Becker, born in East      
 Grinstead, taught Junior children     
 before becoming a farmer's wife and a 
 mother.                               
   Our common interest in our heritage 
 led us to take up this challenge which
 we have enjoyed immensely. Although   
 having lived in Crawley Down for many 
 years, we had not realised the        
 potential interest in the area which  
 we have studied in detail.
