		<content> Over the last 5 to 10 years           
 traditional dairy farming has given   
 way to all types of arable farming in 
 this area.  There are now crops like  
 maize, oil seed rape, peas and beans  
 as well as barley and wheat.          
 Consequently, the fields have become  
 larger; many hedges have been removed 
 to make room for the combine harvester
 and other machinery.  Some of the     
 smaller farms have been swallowed up  
 by the bigger ones,  leaving an excess
 of farmhouses which have been made    
 into private houses.  Britain joining 
 the EEC has made a great difference to
 farmers with policies and prices now  
 decided in Brussels not London. Milk  
 quotas, grain mountains and milk lakes
 affect them. Chew Valley farmers sell 
 their livestock at the Avon Livestock 
 Centre just outside the village.
