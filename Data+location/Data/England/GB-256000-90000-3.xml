		<title>03FARMING ON DARTMOOR.</title>
		<content> The open moorland of Dartmoor is used 
 by farmers to graze stock throughout  
 the year. Much of the land is of very 
 poor quality , no attempt having yet  
 been made to improve it despite E.E.C.
 grants being available. Farmers around
 the moor have Commoners' rights       
 attached to their land holding which  
 allow them to put stock on the moor.  
 Both sheep, often black face Cheviot  
 crosses and beef cattle, mostly belted
 Galaway, roam free over wide areas.   
 'Drifts' bring all the stock off the  
 moor in the annual round up. This     
 allows the lambs and young ponies to  
 be marked or sent to market. At times 
 the farmer suppliments the poor grass 
 with hay, the arrival of the tractor  
 and food giving rise to a 'Wild West' 
 scene the cattle herding in pursuit.  
 The moorland grazing allows farmers to
 use richer low land to grow fodder.   </content>
