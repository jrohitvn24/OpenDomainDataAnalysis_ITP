		<content>  The estate was bought by the Hardy   
 family in 1897 and is now run by Major
 Hardy.                                
   The garden is open on the four      
 Sundays in May and the first one in   
 June from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The      
 garden covers approximately 12 acres  
 and the main flowers are              
 rhododendrons, azaleas and primulas.  
 There are also many trees and         
 flowering shrubs.                     
  There is free parking and a small    
 garden shop.  All the money goes to   
 the National Garden Scheme.           
  The gardens have been open to the    
 public since 1920 and has thousands of
 visitors a year.
