		<content>   I found all these British Nuclear   
 Fuels advertisements and articles in  
 the Whitehaven News, because it is    
 such a big, well known and important  
 place. Most scholar's parents in this 
 school work at Sellafield. Sellafield 
 supports most sports and events in the
 community, as you can see in the      
 advertisements. About the only        
 setback  with Sellafield is the       
 discharging of waste. Several months  
 ago, no-one was allowed on the beach  
 because a small amount of radio active
 waste was discharged out of the       
 pipeline into the sea. Harmless       
 waste is dumped at Drigg. Sellafield  
 produces electricity for most of      
 Cumbria by splitting atoms. It        
 also stores radio active waste. It is 
 one of only about six factories in    
 the world that does this.
