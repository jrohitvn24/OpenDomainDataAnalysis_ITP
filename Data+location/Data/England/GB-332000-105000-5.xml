		<content> Two public houses and a Working Men's 
 Club serve the village and its        
 surrounds. The 'Golden Fleece' at     
 Perry Street regularly provides       
 musical entertainment, and all have   
 Skittle Alleys. Skittles is a popular 
 sport in the region, as are darts and 
 snooker, and teams represent their    
 'home' venue in local league          
 competitions.                         
                                       
 The 'Poppe Inne' celebrates a         
 traditional custom each year when a   
 'candle auction' is held for the      
 rights to a certain field for the     
 coming year. The last bid made when   
 the candle flame goes out is the      
 successful one, and only a small      
 number of people are eligible to take 
 part.
