		<content> My neighbour is a housewife with a    
 husband and two children. She wakes   
 at 6 a.m. and gets up quickly.        
 For breakfast she has cereals,toast   
 and tea. Her children eat with her.   
  Her morning is spent taking children 
 to school, shopping and visiting      
 grandparents. Sometimes she meets     
 other mums for coffee and then she    
 has lunch at home,usually a salad,    
 fruit and tea.In the afternoon she    
 does household chores,gardening and   
 collects children from school.Her     
 evening meal is meat or fish and      
 vegetables,with fruit salad or pie and
 tea.She reads,and watches television  
 for short periods or does other       
 hobbies, ending the day with a drink  
 and going to bed between 10.30. and
