 called Durham Road and Junction Road  
 These are two important{arterial roads
 the former connecting Stockton to the 
 towns and villages in a northerly     
 direction en route to the city of     
 Durham. The latter connects the       
 outlying parts of Stockton to the     
 towns of Norton and more importantly  
 to the chemical manufacturing centre  
 of I.C.I.Billingham.Both roads are    
 constantly busy carrying various      
 forms of{transport}and giving{access  
 to important urban and rural districts
 Both these roads are busy with all the
 usual vehicles as well as being{bus   
{routes.}Heavy vehicles are banned     
 from Junction Road as part of an urban
 improvement plan.There is a pedestrian
 crossing to enable children attending 
 the comprehensive school to cross busy
 Junction Road from Roseworth Estate.  </content>
