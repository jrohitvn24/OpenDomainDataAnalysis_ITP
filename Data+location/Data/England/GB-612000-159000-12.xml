		<title>12ST.STEPHEN'S CHURCH.</title>
		<content>{Merlin's visit}: "The Rev.Pearce gave 
us a lot of information-the Church     
dates back to 1100.There have been 49  
Vicars since 1282.Also there is enough 
room for 230 people at the Church.There
are at least 10 services in a week,and 
there are 50 Christenings in a year.   
There are 25 Weddings and 10/15        
funerals a year.But the church yard is 
not used any more. Inside the Church   
there is a monument of Sir Roger       
Manwood.The 1720 clock is rare because 
it has one hand.Inside there are eight 
bells.We had a look at the Indian Bean 
tree that grows by the church gate."   
{Additional information from Graham,   
Hayley and Sharon}:200 communicants a  
year,20 confirmations each year.The    
oldest tomb is dated 1663.Maintenance  
costs 17,489pounds per annum(covers    
heating/lighting,payments to Diocese.
