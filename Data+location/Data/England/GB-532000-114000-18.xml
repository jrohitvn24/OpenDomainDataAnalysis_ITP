		<content> The Cricket Club runs two teams on    
 Saturday and another on Sunday. Each  
 year there is a well supported Cricket
 Week honoured by a visit by the M.C.C.
 every other year. (Ditchling was used 
 to illustrate the enthusiasm for the  
 game in village life in the book      
 "Cornerstones of English Cricket").   
 There are three football clubs in     
 Ditchling _ two playing soccer and the
 third rugby. The Village of Ditchling 
 Football Club and the Rugby Club have 
 playing facilities in the field in    
 Lewes Road whilst the other football  
 club plays on a field outside the     
 village. The ancient game of Stoolball
 is very popular amongst the ladies and
 their team plays in sixteen local     
 leagues. Juniors are encouraged to    
 carry on the tradition of this unique 
 Sussex game. Two hard tennis courts   
 are also available for the Tennis Club</content>
