		<content>  As Guildford, a large town, is nearby
 some of the land is devoted to market 
 gardening. This involves growing      
 strawberries, lettuces and tomatoes.  
 These are grown in greenhouses or on  
 sun-facing slopes, especially on the  
 Hog's Back area and towards Shalford  
 village and Godalming.                
  Many cows, especially Friesians, are 
 kept on grasslands to yield milk for  
 the towns and villages and for butter 
 and cheese production. Cereals are    
 grown in the Vale of Holmsdale to the 
 east of the town, in the Compton and  
 Loseley area to the west and at the   
 foot of the Hog's Back hills.         
  The soils are fertile and the farming
 is good and prosperous. Some farmers  
 in the area are quite rich.
