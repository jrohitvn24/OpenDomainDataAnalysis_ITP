		<title>16A STREET IN RAMSGATE</title>
		<content> Hardres Street is near the town centre
 of Ramsgate.The flats are modern being
 built of brick with concrete balconies
 :-each block has about 24 individual  
 flats and at the rear of Brunswick    
 Court there is a car park.Flats on the
 ground floor have gardens and to gain 
 access to the flats you need to know  
 someone living there because there is 
 a security system which is operated by
 the residents automatically opening   
 the front door for you.               
 On the opposite side of the road the  
 buildings are much older and more     
 delapidated.These also have           
 gardens.Some of the houses have been  
 converted into shops and even funeral 
 parlours!                             
 Hardres Street itself is quite a busy 
 one-way street which is used by many  
 shoppers as short term parking for up 
 to one hour free.                     </content>
