		<title>11RANSKILL YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content> Our youth club is boring because      
  nothing ever happens.I think the     
 best thing was when a load of people  
 barged in and took some of us outside 
 to get punished!Ithink the other      
 leaders were better because they      
 brought things like inflatables and   
 swing balls E.T.C. About thirty       
 people came to the old one but now    
 only about eighteen people come.Most  
 people are just about always getting  
 banned.At the senior youth club which 
 is held at the church rooms is better 
 but nobody goes.We all have to pay    
 ten pence to get in and fifty pence   
 for membership cards.Junior youthclub 
 starts at 6.30pm on Tuesday.It is held
 in the school hall and Mr Thorpe's    
 classroom.
