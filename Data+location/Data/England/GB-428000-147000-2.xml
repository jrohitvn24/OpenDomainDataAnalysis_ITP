		<content> The three{villages}all appeared in the
 original{Domesday Survey.  Penton     
{Grafton}had a church and thirty-five  
 people;{ Fyfield,}then Fifhide, had a 
 church and perhaps fifteen souls.     
 There has been some growth in nine    
 hundred years but little enough       
 considering the general change in     
 population.                           
                                       
 Smaller communities include{Ragged    
{Appleshaw}with a recent addition of   
 eight semi-detached houses,{Clanville,
{Little Snoddesden}and{Kimpton.} One or
 two houses cluster at the main road   
 crossing while{Redenham Park}and      
{Appleshaw House}are of sufficient size
 to merit inclusion on the large-scale 
 Ordnance Survey map.  The network of  
 minor roads that criss-crosses the    
 block appear to follow the earlier    
 lines created by footpaths.           </content>
