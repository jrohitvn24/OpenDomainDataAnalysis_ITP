		<content> ago but future planning was clearly   
 faulty since so much emphasis on      
 transport and its cost is now evident.
  The fall in population was also not  
 spotted since all First Schools now   
 have excess accomodation, whilst the  
 Middle School has on occasion been    
 overcrowded. Dissatisfaction is felt  
 with the excessive amount of time (at 
 least 1 1/2 hours) some children spend
 on buses each day. Some parents in    
 this area prefer to send their        
 children to independent fee paying    
 schools, Worcester being the most     
 popular.  The 1982 Education Act gave 
 parents more freedom of choice in the 
 schooling of their children which they
 now exercise.  There still remains a  
 hardcore of exceptionally supportive  
 parents to the local village school   
 who do their utmost to help in these  
 times of economic stringency.         </content>
