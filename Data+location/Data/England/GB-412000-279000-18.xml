		<title>18St.Alphege Church</title>
		<content> The building of the first church was  
 begun in 1210 and considerably        
 enlarged about 1270. To begin with the
 building was a nave, chancel and a big
 square tower between them. The chapel 
 of St.Thomas a Becket was the first   
 addition and later a new chancel.     
   In the middle of the 14th century   
 the Becket Chapel was pulled down and 
 rebuilt as a north aisle. Nothing more
 was done until 1470 when the upper    
 storey of the tower was added, with a 
 spire 22 feet higher than the present 
 one of 168 feet. Extensive extension  
 work was done in 1535. In March 1757  
 the spire was blown down and replaced 
 with the present one. Restoration work
 on spire, tower and buttressing has   
 been done in 1841,1865,1911 &amp; 1953.   
 The spire is the most famous landmark 
 in Solihull.
