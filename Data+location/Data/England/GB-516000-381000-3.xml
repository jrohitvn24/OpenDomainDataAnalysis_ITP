		<title>03HOUSING, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>    Until recently, almost all the     
 houses in{South Willingham}were owned 
 by the Hainton estate. Older houses in
 the village, i.e.,pre-nineteenth      
 century, were built of local stone, or
 bricks made in the Willingham brick   
 works. Two are still thatched, others 
 have locally made pantiles. Nineteenth
 century houses were made of local     
 brick, but some have slate roofs.     
 Recent bungalows are made of non-local
 materials.                            
   {East Barkwith}has no thatched      
 cottages left. A few houses contain   
 old, small bricks. Several houses and 
 the school are made of{Willingham}    
 brick, and some have pantile roofs.   
 Later houses have slate roofs. Modern 
 houses, and restored houses, use      
 non-local materials.
