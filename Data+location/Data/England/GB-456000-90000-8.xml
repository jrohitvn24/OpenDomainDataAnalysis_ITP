		<title>08Ryde Pier</title>
		<content>   In{1812}a company was formed called 
 the{Ryde Pier Company}and a bill      
 passed in Parliament to make this law 
 The first pier was wooden{1,740 feet  
{long}with a toll house at the shore   
 end.This meant that boats could tie up
 and unload their passengers without   
 getting their feet wet.In{1824,1827   
{and 1833}the pier was extended,in{1846
 the pierhead was enlarged to take more
 boats.In the{1870's}a new pier was    
 built alongside the old pier,so{Ryde} 
 had two piers for a while.In the{     
{1860's}the first{horsedrawn trams}    
 arrived to take people from the boats 
 to the shore.The first{train arrived  
{in 1876}when a track was laid         
 alongside the tramway.{Ryde pier}is a 
 half a mile long which is the{second  
{longest in the country.  }
