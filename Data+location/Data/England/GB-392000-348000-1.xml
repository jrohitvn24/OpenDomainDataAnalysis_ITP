The main area which is comprised of    
Bagnall and its surroundings are       
hilly,rough grazing and pasture land   
with a few outcrops of woodland which  
suggests the main industry is farming, 
with beef and dairy the main products. 
   The main features are the           
sub-station owned by the Central       
Electricity Generating Board which     
supplies the Midlands with             
electricity;the nurserys which offer   
the public gardening facilities and the
Hospital which is for the mentally     
retarded.                              
   Bagnall is an authentic styled      
village with old styled cottages,but in
 the Werrington area there is a modern 
estate of new semi-detached and        
detached houses.                       
   The roads which make the Area       
accessible are narrow country lanes.   </content>
