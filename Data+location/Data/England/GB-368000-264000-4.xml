		<content> The majority of houses are occupied by
 their owners, although several farms  
 in the area belong to the Winnington  
 estate.  There are 3 Council Houses   
 and 2 Old Persons' Bungalows for rent.
 Of the main employers in the area,    
 C.N. Jones and J.W. Lane have no      
 workers resident in the area and      
 Stanford Court uses buses to transport
 the majority of employees to their    
 work from local population centres.   
 The tendency over the past few years  
 has been to sell cottages as they     
 become vacant.  Prices and the need   
 to renovate them have put them beyond 
 the range of first time buyers.       
 This year, The Old Mill was advertised
 at #95,000.  School Cottages, which   
 housed three families has now been    
 sold as one dwelling.
