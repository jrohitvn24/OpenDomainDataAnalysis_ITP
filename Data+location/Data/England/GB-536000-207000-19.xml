		<title>19THE TOWER CENTRE</title>
		<content>{The Tower Centre}is to the north of   
 Hoddesdon town centre. It was built in
 the late sixties when such            
 developments were in vogue. It        
 originally comprised of a car park    
 built below a shopping precinct, a    
 bowling alley and a twenty storey     
 block of flats. The bowling alley has 
 since been closed. The site was       
 formally occupied by a number of old  
 buildings including some delightful   
 houses.                               
  In our survey of the centre we asked 
 a series of questions relating to the 
 shopping precinct. We found that most 
 shoppers were regular visitors though 
 none travelled more than a few miles  
 to shop there. Most were happy with   
 the precinct but would like a large   
 department store in the town. Many    
 expressed disapproval of the design of
 the precinct.                         </content>
