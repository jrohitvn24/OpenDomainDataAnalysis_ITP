		<title>16CLIFFTOP WALK CONTINUED</title>
		<content>{COASTGUARD COTTAGES:}These were built 
 to house the coastguards when there   
 was a need to look after this part of 
 the coast. The cottages are single    
 storey to protect them from the       
 bleakness and winds.                  
{Cliffsend Farm:} In the garden are two
 World War II gun emplacements, one is 
 now used as a stable the other as part
 of the farmhouse accommodation.       
{TUNNEL:}Beside the farm this tunnel   
 was used for bringing up seaweed which
 was used as manure on the fields in   
 the 1880's.                           
{FLORA:}On the walk many types of flora
 can be seen but near the Hoverport    
 access road is a small colony of{Flax 
{(Linum)}the purple flowering annual   
 which is not only rare but an         
 endangered specie. The walk ends at   
 the Sportsman where the cliffs end and
 the marsh begins.                     </content>
