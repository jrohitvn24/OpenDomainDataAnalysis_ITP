		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> This area consists almost entirely of 
 the flat wetlands of Street and Walton
 Moors, which are used almost entirely 
 for pasture for dairy herds.  To the  
 north there is a well-defined ridge   
 (Walton and Ivythorn Hill) from which 
 extensive views may be enjoyed to the 
 south and north.  Much of this ridge  
 is the property of the National Trust.
  Nestling beneath its dip slope are a 
 handful of farms which comprise the   
 total population of the block with the
 exception of part of the village of   
 Dundon situated on highland to the    
 south-west.  No roads traverse the    
 block and communication is made more  
 arduous by the drainage ditches       
 surrounding each field on the         
 wetlands.  There are three "Decoy     
 Pools" situated here.  There is no    
 industry or community centre(save for 
 Dundon Church) in the block.          </content>
