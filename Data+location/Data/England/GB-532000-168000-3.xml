		<content>   We play games in the playground, in 
 the streets, gardens and parks.       
   'Ball He' is popular. A ball is     
 needed, 'He' throws the ball at       
 someone and if it hits anyone they    
 become 'He'.                          
   Another game is 'Gladiator'. One    
 person is the gladiator, one person is
 his prisoner, The object is to 'kill' 
 the enemy. You can use a cricket bat, 
 badmington racket, tennis balls or    
 tennis rackets. You must touch your   
 enemy twice to kill him.              
 If a prisoner kills a gladiator he    
 turns into the gladiator himself.     
   '40_40' is also played, it is       
 similar to 'Hide and seak'. Someone   
 closes her eyes and the others hide.  
 If she turns round and sees anyone she
 shouts out '40_40 I see Fred behind   
 the dustbins', and then Fred is it.
