		<title>10ABBERLEY HALL CLOCK TOWER</title>
		<content> The clock tower was built in{1883}by  
{John Joseph Jones}the owner of the    
 hall. It stands on Merritts Hill,     
 which is 700ft. high, and can be seen 
 from the surrounding countryside. The 
 tower stands{161ft.}high and is a     
 mixture of 13th.and 14th. century     
 Gothic styles, designed by{P.St.Aubyn.
 It is thought that the tower was      
 erected to improve the Abberley Hall  
 estate in competition with Lord Dudley
 at Witley Court.The large room halfway
 up was used by the owner's wife as a  
 sewing room. The tower contained a    
{carillon}which played tunes every     
 three hours, from a selection of forty
 two in addition to chiming the hours  
 and quarter hours.The carillon machine
 and sixteen of the bells were removed 
 in{1939.}The clock now chimes on the  
 five remaining bells.In the second    
 world war it was an observation post. </content>
