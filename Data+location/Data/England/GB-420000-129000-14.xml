		<title>14WILDLIFE AROUND FARLEY</title>
		<content> There are many mammals around Farley. 
 The largest of these are fallow deer, 
 of which there are many. Foxes and    
 badgers are fairly common and there   
 are lots of rabbits and squirrels.    
 There are many smaller mammals        
 including harvest mice, dormice, moles
 and shrews.                           
 There are plenty of birds including   
 crows, blackbirds, sparrows, robins,  
 woodpeckers, cuckoos and house        
 martins. As well as the usual insects 
 there is the rare Purple Emperor      
 butterfly, which is found in Blackmoor
 Copse, a nature reserve. One day in   
 July, 1985 on a walk through          
 Blackmoor Copse we saw these animals: 
 pheasant, partridge, worm, black ants,
 red ants, mole, spider, flies, bees,  
 butterflies, beetle, woodlice,        
 centipede and lacewings.
