         The whole of the area has     
 suffered greatly from the effects of  
 Dutch Elm disease, resulting in the   
 existence of very few{trees}of any    
 kind.                                 
         The initiative for tree       
 planting rests with those individuals 
 with a conscience. Some of the farmers
 are concerned with the{ecology,}one of
 whom has planted five hundred saplings
 on his land in recent years.          
         Some have refrained from{crop 
 spraying in order to allow wild plants
 and animals to survive. Many farmers  
 have retained{hedge}boundaries for    
 this reason.                          
         A small copse of oak trees is 
 guarded as it is unusual for these    
 trees to grow in this area.
