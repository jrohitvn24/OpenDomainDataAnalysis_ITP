		<content>{    A WALK TO THE NATURE RESERVE.     
    There are many flowers and much    
 wild life in the{Edward Richardson and
{Phyllis Amey Nature Reserve}plus a    
 pike-filled lake, which was originally
 one of the first gravel pits in the   
 Cotswolds. Digging in Lechlade ended  
 in May 1984. From the hide we observed
 coots, mallard, and a heron. Outside  
 we heard birds singing and we         
 disturbed two partridges in a barley  
 field. We saw blue damsel flies and   
 found marsh orchids in flower. There  
 were seed pods on the toad flax and   
 veitches and we saw scarlet pimpernel 
 and speedwell. We passed a field of   
 poppies and noticed an animals lair.  
 It was too big for a mole or rabbit, I
 think it was a fox hole. Adders are   
 frequently to be seen. A mammoths tusk
 was recently found by Steven Woodward.
