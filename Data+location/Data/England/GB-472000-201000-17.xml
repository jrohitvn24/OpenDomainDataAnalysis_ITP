   However if teenagers are restricted 
 to the village it is felt that lack of
 interesting activities will produce   
 restless and bored young people with  
 energy to spare. Already vandalism is 
 on the increase and there have been   
 several cases of arson reported.      
 Villagers, through the Parish Council,
 are asking for finance to improve     
 facilities.                           
   A Charitable Trust exists in Chinnor
 using funds obtained from the sale of 
 the old village school. This Trust    
 provides grants to young people of    
 Chinnor for educational purposes.     
   Sydenham has its own Munday's       
 Charity. The family of Munday is old  
 established in this village. The      
 Charity aids older people with money  
 for personal bills, allotment         
 provision and Christmas presents.     </content>
