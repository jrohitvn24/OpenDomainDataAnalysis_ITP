		<title>16Young people in N.Upottery</title>
		<content>   There are not that many young       
 families in our valley,but,although   
 there seems to be little special      
 provision for them,most seem content  
 with country life.For the little ones 
 there are Playgroups at Smeatharpe and
 Upottery and a lively primary school  
 in Upottery,but after the age of      
 eleven they are swept away to Honiton 
 or Taunton,or even further afield,for 
 their secondary schools. From then    
 on,a lot of their spare time will be  
 spent pursuing interests and friend-  
 ships outside Upottery.There is a very
 popular Youth Club in Honiton.Local   
 links remain strong,though,encouraged 
 by the Young Farmers and by village   
 discos.Older teenagers find that cars 
 and mopeds make it easy to combine the
 joys of country life with the         
 attractions offered by town and city.
