		<title>03Manor Park Old Glossop</title>
		<content>      {Manor Park}is{60}acres in size. 
 It is called Manor Park because it was
 the grounds of the hall owned by the{ 
{Duke of Norfolk.}The old hall became  
 unsafe and was demolished. The grounds
 were given to the people of Glossop.  
 The original lodge still remains at   
 the main entrance but there is little 
 trace of the old hall. Oak panelling  
 from the old hall is now in a pub-the{
{Peels Arms}in{Padfield.}              
       A river,{Glossop Brook}flows    
 through the park. The park has swings,
 slides,climbing frames, roundabouts   
 etc. It has a lake with ducks on it.  
 People can hire boats out for {50p.}  
 There is also a crazy golf course and 
 tennis courts.                        
       A miniature railway starts from 
 the tennis courts and goes around the 
 park. This costs{10p}and you get a    
 free toffee whistle lolly to blow.    </content>
