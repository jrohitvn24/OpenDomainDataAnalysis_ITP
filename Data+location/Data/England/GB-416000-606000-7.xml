		<content>{Anna.}At 9 o'clock,when I come in I   
 get my hymn book and line up to go    
 into assembly.Assembly is usually made
 up with a Bible story,a prayer,the    
 Lord's prayer and a hymn,usually on   
 the subject of the story.When we come 
 back into class we finish off old work
 while Mr. Bagley calls the register.  
 Then we do multiplication tables.If we
 have practised our tables until they  
 are perfect we go on to special books 
 called 6 a day,7 a day etc etc.Then,on
 Wednesday's,we do either work from    
 Oxford English books,with the numbers 
 to our standards.Or we write stories  
 in our English books.At 10:25 we go   
 out for playtime and at 10:45 we get  
 on the bus to go swimming,(on         
 Wednesday's.) It costs 45p to go swim-
 ming. The pool is in Alnwick.There is 
 a man called Alan who teaches the swi-
 mmers,(people further on.)Mr.Bagley   </content>
