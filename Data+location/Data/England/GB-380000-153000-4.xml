 Although there is some employment     
 locally and some villagers are self-  
 employed, many people travel to the   
 nearby towns to work. This means most 
 families have to run a car. Villagers 
 also travel to the towns for major    
 shopping and for visits to the cinema,
 theatre and sports centres. In their  
 leisure time apart from gardening and 
 home maintenance, many people enjoy   
 walking in the country, and the 3 pubs
 are pleasant places to quench your    
 thirst and meet neighbours. There is  
 fishing and canoeing on the river     
 Frome. A meal can be enjoyed at the   
 local steak-house and at other pubs   
 and hotels within easy reach of the   
 village. It is an active village      
 socially with many clubs covering a   
 wide range of interests and many fund 
 raising events are held for charity.  </content>
