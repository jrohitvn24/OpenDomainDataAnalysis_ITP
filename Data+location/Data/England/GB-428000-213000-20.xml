		<content>   31 children from the junior class of
Leafield Primary School participated in
the project.Initially they delivered   
500 informative letters,followed by 40 
questionnaires to                      
volunteers.Practically they have had to
concentrate on the village,but a group 
of older children cycled round the     
whole area at the end of the project.  
   The children would like to thank    
everyone in Leafield for their interest
and help,but especially the following: 
Sue Bodinham,Iris Clapton,David        
Colmer,Barry Philcox,Betty             
Appleton,Terry Pearson,Pam Beale,Pat   
Calcutt and their teacher,Juliet Smart.
   During the project the children     
interiewed people,drew and read maps   
and made a relief map of tkeir km.     
square and learnt a great deal about   
their home area.
