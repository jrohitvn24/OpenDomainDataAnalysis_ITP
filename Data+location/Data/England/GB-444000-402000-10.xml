		<title>10HIGHGATE GREYHOUND TRACK</title>
		<content> The track is at{Highgate}on Thurnscoe 
 Road.  Greyhound racing first started 
 at{Manchester}where a track was built 
 in the period between{1931-32.} The   
 present track nowadays is wet sand but
 it used to be turf.  However turf made
 the time slower.                      
 Greyhounds used to chase an{electric  
{hare}a bit like a teddy and sometimes 
 still do but it never lasts more than 
 one meeting and it was too expensive. 
 So now a plastic bag is sometimes     
 used.  The track is open at 6.30p.m.  
 on Monday and Thursdays. and on       
 Sundays there are trials at 11.00 a.m.
{ Greyhounds are handicapped}according 
 to the times they run.  The Stadium   
 usually has{600 Spectators}watching   
 but 2000 approximately would fit in   
 the Stadium.  There is a public bar   
 where you can go and have a drink.
