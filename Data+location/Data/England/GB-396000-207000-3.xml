		<title>03VILLAGE,DUNTISBOURNE ABBOTS</title>
		<content> Duntisbourne Abbots nestles in the    
 Cotswolds between Winstone and Leer.It
 is perhaps the most unspoilt of the   
 three villages.Care has been taken to 
 situate modern Council housing on the 
 outskirts of the village and newer    
 buildings follow the traditional stone
 style.                                
 The name is taken from the river Dunt 
 (Dunt was a Saxon Chief),which rises  
 in the village ,and from connections  
 with monks from the Abbey of          
 Gloucester who controlled the area in 
 the 13th Century.                     
 Together Abbots and Leer have a total 
 population of 215 residents,18.5%     
 under16, 28% of pensionable age.The   
 Youth Hostel attracts many visitors   
 and makes the village an ideal centre 
 for the study of all the Cotswolds    
 offer.The atmosphere is idyllically   
 peaceful.                             </content>
