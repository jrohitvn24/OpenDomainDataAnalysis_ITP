   Some{18th century}houses are being  
 pulled down and new houses and flats  
 are being put up.On a new housing     
 estate in{Warley}the houses vary in   
 price from{Â£29,000}for a maisonette to
{Â£87,000}for a four bedroomed detached 
 house but the houses are rapidly      
 increasing in price.This new estate   
 will consist of{271}units and will    
 take at least 3 years to complete.    
    10 years ago new flats were built  
 amongst the old victorian             
 houses.These houses were quickly put  
 up and not as well planned as the     
 modern estates.Most of the large      
 victorian houses are now being used as
{solicitors}offices and{doctors}       
 surgeries or being renovated into     
 flats.
