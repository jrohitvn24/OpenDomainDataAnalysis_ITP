		<title>17JODRELL BANK (ASTRONOMY)</title>
		<content> Jodrell Bank is the site of Manchester
 University's Nuffield Radio Astronomy 
 laboratories. It contains the 250 foot
 radio telescope which is visible for  
 miles around.                         
                                       
 This telescope was completed in 1957  
 and came to public attention almost   
 immediately when it made observations 
 on Sputnik 1, man's first object in   
 space.                                
                                       
 The main function of Jodrell Bank is  
 in making observations for research   
 into the origins and composition of   
 the universe. The telescope's size    
 allows it to measure very weak radio  
 signals. To accurately discriminate   
 between close objects its observations
 are compared, by computer, with those 
 made by other radio telescopes in     
 Cheshire, Europe or even the USA.     </content>
