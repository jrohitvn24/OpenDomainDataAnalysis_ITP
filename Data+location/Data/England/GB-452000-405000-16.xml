		<content>    Today people wear anything they    
 want because there isn't a particular 
 fashion at the moment. A lot of people
 wear jeans which are a kind of very   
 tight trouser made out of a material  
 called denim. Very short skirts known 
 as Mini-skirts are also worn. The     
 shoes which are in fashion are very   
 pointed and have a stiletto heel which
 comes down to a small metal tip about 
 seven millimetres in diameter.        
    Short hair is fashionable now      
 although, like clothes, people wear it
 in any style. Some people dye their   
 hair and make it stick up with a gel. 
 This is called Mohican style after    
 some Red Indians.                     
    Lots of people have their ears     
 pierced and wear large earrings. A few
 people have theirs pierced several    
 times and wear six or more studs as   
 well as earrings.                     </content>
