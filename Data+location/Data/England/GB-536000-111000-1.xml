		<title>01Rural Area,N.W.of Lewes</title>
		<content>  The 12 squares to the N.W. of Lewes  
 divide into three distinct areas.     
  To the south the four squares are    
 covered by open downland much of which
 is used for agricultural purposes,    
 mainly cereal crops.This area includes
 the old race course buildings and the 
 site of the Battle of Lewes.          
  Through the central four squares runs
 the steep scarp of the South Downs.The
 South Downs Way runs along the top    
 edge of the scarp, passing the highest
 point,Black Cap,206 feet above sea    
 level.The B2116 runs along the foot of
 the scarp.                            
  The northern four squares are in the 
 valley.Many farms are situated here,  
 the land being a patchwork of small   
 fields,some with crops,others used for
 grazing cattle and sheep.The main     
 Hastings to London railway line runs  
 through the N.E.corner of this area.  </content>
