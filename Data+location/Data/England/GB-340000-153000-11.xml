		<title>11KING JOHN'S HUNTING LODGE</title>
		<content>{King John's Hunting Lodge}is a very   
 old building. It is made of wood. On  
 the ground floor the building stands  
 on a stone sill, visible outside. This
 has prevented the wood from rotting   
 and explains the survival of the      
 house.On the second floor you go up   
 winding stairs. You can see lath and  
 plaster behind a little door in the   
 wall.There was always a stone wall    
 between the houses so fire could not  
 spread.There is a model of the square 
 on the top floor of the Lodge.        
 Although Axbridge is an old place     
 there are many new houses built in the
 last twenty years.On these new housing
 estates you will find a mixture of    
 styles some are terraced some         
 semi-detached and others detached.Some
 people own their houses whilst other  
 people rent their houses from the     
 local council.                        </content>
