		<title>01NORTHERN PORTSMOUTH HARBOUR</title>
		<content> This block covers most of Northern    
 Portsmouth Harbour.  Portchester      
 Castle, a well preserved Roman Fort   
 with Norman additions, is also here,  
 and we conducted a tourism survey     
 there.  The conservation area of      
 Castle Street is nearby, and we looked
 at tourism and events there.          
 The Naval presence is strong, with    
 Whale Island, home of HMS Excellent   
 and Naval land near Gosport in this   
 block, but this is only a shadow of   
 fifty years ago when locals can       
 remember the Harbour as a sea of grey 
 through the battleships.  Today the   
 Royal Navy is much reduced in size.   
 Lastly, we looked at services provided
 in the South West corner of this      
 block.
