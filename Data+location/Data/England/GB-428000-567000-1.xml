		<content>Fine Fare is part of Associated Foods. 
Fine Fare at Hadrian Lodge West was    
built in 1983.It covers 22,000sq       
metres,on one level.It was built on a  
new estate where there are no other    
shops.The rates there are lower than   
they are near the town centre.Every day
they get deliveries of some of the     
thousands of products they sell.These  
are stored in the warehouse at the back
of Fine Fare.Head Office in Washington 
decides almost all matters of trading. 
About 13,000 customers use the store   
each week.The busiest times are        
Thursday and Friday nights.165 people  
work in the store.The idea of"Pack Your
Own"came from Canada.It is popular     
because it is cheaper and you can buy  
small quantities,but the store has to  
be careful of the Health Regulations.
