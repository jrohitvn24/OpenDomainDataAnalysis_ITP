 a level crossing count.{              
{TUESDAY}A school trip arranged to     
 Ripon Cathedral, Fountains Abbey and  
 Brimham Rocks, which the whole group  
 attended.                             
{WEDNESDAY}We returned to Cononley in  
 the morning to take photos of the     
 area. In the afternoon we walked up to
 Cononley Lead Mine also taking photos.

 had gathered into the computer. We    
 also interviewed a girl about her     
 home, Well Head Farm, which was then  
 used for one of our pages.
