		<content>{St. Alkmunds}church was built in 1712.
 It was built with white stone, so that
 is how Whitchurch got its name.It cost
 Â£4,000 pounds to build it.In the      
 archway of the church is the heart of 
{Sir John Talbot.}There are 8 bells in 
 the bell room.                        
   I think church is boring because it 
 has the same service every week and   
 the rector says all the same things.I 
 think it is not for children it is    
 more for grown ups.My mum takes me to 
 church because I am going to be       
 confirmed in 1 years time.My Mum,Dad  
 and Caroline have all been confirmed  
 they can go up for bread and wine.    
                                       
   {% of children who go to church     
 in each class at our school.
