		<title>02Farming in Plympton St.Mary</title>
		<content>   There are several farms around in   
 our area many of them go back to the  
 original{Domesday Book.               
  They are fairly evenly divided       
 between{Dairy}and{Beef}and most have  
 been in the family for years.         
   There have been one or two changes  
 from being just farms.Some have       
 changed to part farm and other        
 business activities,while others are  
 considering expanding their{camping   
 activities.Another has expanded his   
 Dairy and has set up a{Farm shop.     
   The farmers themselves have an      
 arduous task each day which can take  
 them up to 24hrs to complete! If any  
 of them are ill then there is         
 commendable cameraderie amongst them  
 and they all set to and help the      
 poorly farmer to keep the farm under  
 control.                              
                                       </content>
