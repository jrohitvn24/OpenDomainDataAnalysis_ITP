		<content>  Wringworthy Farm is near the A386.The
 house is very old and is mentioned in 
 the original Domesday Book as Wering  
 Gertha.In their large dining room is a
 piece of linenfold panelling which    
 probably came from Tavistock Abbey at 
 the time of the dissolution.          
  Wringworthy Farm consists of 140     
 acres, 80 of which are around the     
 farmhouse while the remaining 60 acres
 are rented at Mary Tavy.Mr.Anning,who 
 owns the farm,keeps 55 dairy cows and 
 about 80 young stock.Twelve years ago 
 his farm was a mixed farm as he grew a
 few crops and kept some sheep as well 
 as keeping cattle.He now concentrates 
 on dairy farming.He milks his cows at 
 7a.m.and 5p.m and they produce        
 5400 k.g of milk a year.The heifers   
 have their first calf when they are   
 2\ and the calves are born between    
 August and March.                     </content>
