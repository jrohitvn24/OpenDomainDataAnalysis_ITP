		<content> In the morning I usually get up at    
 7.20. I wash , get dressed and at 7.30
 I have my breakfast. My breakfast     
 usually consists of cornflakes, toast,
 a boiled egg and a cup of tea. After  
 breakfast I go and practice on the    
 piano. At 8.25 I go to our bus stop   
 with my brother. Our bus arrives at   
 8.35. On the main road we have a good 
 view of the fields. Coming into Leaden

 on the left hand side, on the right   
 hand side is the Country Shop.At 8.55
