		<content>   There is quite a variety of housing 
 in the area although few houses are   
 older than this century.              
  {Chadwell}has many 1920's style      
 council houses near Riverview,then    
 a post-war development around         
 Herringham School,plus 60's housing   
 around the Tower blocks.The town      
 houses near the old peoples' home won 
{a design award}in the early 70's.     
   Many of the {Council Houses}in      
 Chadwell are now privately owned and  
 well-maintained. The older ones have  
 been up-dated and have much larger    
 gardens then the newer houses.        
   The same is true of{Tilbury}to a    
 certain extent. The housing around    
 Melba Gardens is rather drab and not  
 so well-cared for,although Thurrock   
 U.D.C. has painted and renovated those
 facing Feenan Highway.Around Manor    
 School the houses are in poor repair. </content>
