		<title>20A day in the Life of my Dad.</title>
		<content>   My Dad gets up at 7am on a weekday, 
 washes, gets dressed, shaves, and goes
 downstairs for breakfast. He then     
 drives to the office in Romsey. He    
 looks at the post, answers any letters
 that need answering, and then enters  
 into the account books any cheques    
 received or items purchased. He may   
 then continue with the design of a    
 training program or discuss with      
 customers their requirements, or may  
 visit a customer or attend a meeting  
 with a supplier. In the afternoon he  
 will sign any letters and test any    
 programs that are under developement. 
 He may also organise the assembly of  
 cassettes. In between 6 and 7 he      
 arrives home, says goodnight to the   
 younger children, or helps with       
 homework, other times he may play     
 games. After supper he does office    
 work and goes to bed about 10.        </content>
