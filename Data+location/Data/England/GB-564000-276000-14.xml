		<title>14 MORLEY'S COACHES-WEST ROW</title>
		<content>                                       
    IN THE CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE IS A  
LARGE GARAGE FRONTED BY A HUGE YARD -  
THE HOME OF MORLEY'S GREY COACHES.     
    THE GARAGE ITSELF DATES BACK TO    
1926, ALTHOUGH THE MORLEY FAMILY OF    
WEST ROW HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
HAULAGE BUSINESS SINCE THE TIME OF     
GREAT-GRANDFATHER MORLEY WHO TOOK GOODS
TO BURY MARKET BY HORSE AND CART.      
    MORLEY'S GREY COACHES OPERATE LOCAL
SCHOOL RUNS, SERVICES TO NEWMARKET AND 
CAMBRIDGE, TRIPS TO THE SEASIDE AND    
TAKE PARTIES TO MANY PARTS OF EUROPE.  
                                       
                                       
    SADLY, SINCE THIS SURVEY WAS UNDER-
TAKEN, MORLEY'S GREY COACHES HAVE      
CEASED TRADING. THE GARAGE, WHICH WAS  
ONCE SUCH A BUSY PART OF THE VILLAGE,  
IS STRANGELY QUIET AND DESERTED.
