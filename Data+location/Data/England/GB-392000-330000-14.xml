		<title>14FARM ANIMALS, BURSTON AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
Because of over production in agricul- 
ture within the European Economic      
Community, especially milk products, it
has been necessary to curb dairy       
outputs. This has been achieved by the 
imposition of milk quotas. One or two  
of the farmers in the area have ceased 
milk production and changed to cereals 
and beef with mainly Hereford, Angus   
and Charolais crosses.                 
                                       
The remaining dairy herds are predomin-
antly pedigree Friesian cattle. A few  
of the farms have sheep as a sideline. 
Horses are no longer used for farm work
and there are only a few kept for      
riding. In common with the rest of the 
country this area has tended to move   
from horn to corn. Farms generally are 
becoming more specialised.
