		<content>      There are just two factories     
 within our area. These factories are  
 Ward Blenkinsops and Fords.           
      Ward Blenkinsops is a chemical   
 factory producing pharmecutical       
 products,fungicides and other fine    
 chemicals. It is located in open      
 countryside away from centres of      
 population. Established in 1939 it now
 makes over one hundred products, many 
 of these being exported all over the  
 world.                                
      The Ford factory produces motor  
 vehicles. The plant was opened in 1962
 and now employs over 10,000 people.   
 The vehicles produced include the     
 Escort and the Orion. More than four  
 million vehicles have been made in the
 Halewood factory since it was opened.
