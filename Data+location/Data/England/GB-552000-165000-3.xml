		<content>We can see the river through the fence 
at the bottom of our school field. Our 
school ground used to be a meadow . The
Eynsford village used to hold an annual
Donkey Derby. They had boat rides on   
the river . Now it would be impossible.
We still catch fish but not so many. We
have seen crayfish , trout, dace and   
chubb. Our caretaker said there were 33
varieties of fish. Now the river does  
not get cleared of weed and rubbish and
it is getting silted up in places. In  
1976 parts of the river dried up and   
many fish died. At the Millhouse in    
Farningham there is a weather vane     
which is a life size replica of a      
9lb.2oz. trout found in the millpond in
1808.
