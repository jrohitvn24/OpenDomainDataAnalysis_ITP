		<content> Pupils undertook the work with        
 enthusiasm .5th-20th June             
                                       
    Problems arose when we could only  
 visit on Wednesday and Thursday- that 
 is of course the day the Tesco Bus    
 visits Ansley so most people were out 
 shopping- taking advantage of the free
 bus service.                          
    Villagers were most helpful and    
 answered questions willingly.Some     
 were prepared to chat for a long time 
 whilst others gave the brief          
 information requested and then went   
 about their business.The second visit 
 was more difficult because other      
 groups had also been asking questions 
 and the villagers were beginning to   
 lose patience with the interviewers,  
 if they had been questioned more than 
 once.                                 
                                       </content>
