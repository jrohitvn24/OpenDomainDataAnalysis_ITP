		<content>  More adventurous characters spend    
 their time skiing on snow and water,  
 working on archaelogical digs, caring 
 for peacocks and budgies, playing     
 tennis, squash or badminton for which 
 they have to leave the area.          
  A few hobbies fall into the 1%       
 category, namely sailing, fishing,    
 photography, cycling, wine-making,    
 carpentery and cigarette card         
 collecting. It is not surprising that 
 the watersports are not a favourite:  
 the only expanses of water in the     
 area are not publicly available.      
  The main reason for the variety of   
 hobbies is the difference in ages and 
 backrounds. The more elderly          
 inhabitants participate in indoor     
 hobbies, the younger in outdoor       
 hobbies.
