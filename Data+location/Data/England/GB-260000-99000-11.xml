		<title>11The Churches in Sampford</title>
		<content>{The Methodist Chapel}dates from 1933  
 and still used. It is part of the     
 Hatherleigh circuit.                  
{The Parish Church of Saint Andrew }was
 entirely rebuilt about 1450.The Rood  
 Screen has been reconstructed from    
 fragments and replaced in the south   
 aisle.The barrel ceiling has several  
 splendidly  carved bosses.There is an 
 old chest made from a solid piece of  
 oak which was  probably the one placed
 in the Chancel to receive the         
 Communion Alms as required by the     
 First English Prayer Book of 1549.This
 is what started the Prayer Book       
 Rebellion.                            
 The church shares a Rector with       
 Exbourne,Honeychurch and Jacobstowe.  
 As in the other villages congregations
 are dwindling and mainly the elderly.
