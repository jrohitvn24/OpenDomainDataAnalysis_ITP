		<content> THERE ARE TUMULI IN THIS AREA ON THE  
 TOPS OF THE DOWNS, PROBABLY CONNECTED 
 WITH A NEARBY FORT. WHEN THE CAR PARK 
 AT WHITE HILL WAS EXCAVATED, MANY     
 SKELETONS WERE FOUND, AGAIN THOUGHT TO
 BE CONNECTED WITH A NEIGHBOURING      
 ANCIENT SETTLEMENT.    THE AREA AROUND
 FIELD BARN FARM HAS MUCH HISTORICAL   
 INTEREST. CANNON BALLS HAVE BEEN FOUND
 IN  THE FIELD NORTH OF THE FARM. THESE
 ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE RESULT OF TEST  
 FIRING FROM A FARM 1 MILE TO THE NORTH
 DURING THE BATTLE OF NEWBURY IN THE   
 17th CENTURY &amp; HAVE GIVEN THEIR NAME  
 TO NEARBY DOWNLAND. THE FIELDS WEST OF
 THE FARM WERE USED AS A NAVAL RANGE   
 DURING THE 2nd WORLD WAR. THE STRAIGHT
 TRACK MARKED NORTH-SOUTH ON THE MAP   
 SHOWS THE POSITION OF A FORMER RAILWAY
 WHICH WAS USED TO RETRIEVE SHELLS     
 FIRED UP INTO A CHALK PIT ON THE EDGE 
 OF CANNON HEATH DOWN.                 </content>
