		<title>05BUTT AND OYSTER AT PIN MILL</title>
		<content>  The Butt and Oyster Pub is by the    
water's edge at Pin Mill. At some      
Spring tides the water comes right up  
to the Pub walls. It is very popular   
because it is very old and traditional.
The building is one of the oldest in   
Pin Mill. It has brick floors and      
wooden tables and settles. In the      
winter there is a log fire in the      
bar. The beer is served from the       
barrel. There is a dining room and     
food is also served out-side in the    
summer. Many of the customers that go  
to the Butt and Oyster come from other 
towns and villages. Locals and         
yachtsmen also enjoy its warm and      
friendly atmosphere. Every Christmas   
Eve there is Carol Singing at the Butt 
which is lead by the Rector. In the    
Summer, Morris Dancers and the  Land-  
lord's Mummers team perform.
