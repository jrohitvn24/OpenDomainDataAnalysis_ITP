		<title>06  THE HARVEY BROTHERS</title>
		<content>     The Harvey brothers were born at  
 Blake Farm and have lived there all   
 their lives. They now run the farm    
 together. They each have a house of   
 their own. Mr Clive Harvey's house is 
 500 years old and is timber framed. Mr
 John Harvey's house is quite new.     
   Clive's hobby is flying. He owns    
 Andrews Airfield and has two planes   
 there. He is also renovating a plane  
 that was used in the second world war.
 He found it in Italy where it had been
 used by the Italian Airforce. It is a 
 Harvard plane and it was used for     
 bombing. He hopes evetually that it   
 will fly.                             
   John's hobby is shooting. The       
 brothers have 50 acres of woodland and
 they grow special crops to encourage  
 wildlife. Between November and January
 they organise Shoots where people can 
 come and shoot pheasants.             </content>
