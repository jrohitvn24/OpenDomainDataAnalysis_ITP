		<content> I live in a quiet, unmade-up road, ten
 minutes walk from Camberley town      
 centre. At the bottom of my garden is 
 another road, on which three new      
{houses}have been built on the end of  
 peoples' gardens.                     
                                       
 There is also a lot of{waste ground   
 which is overgrown with brambles &amp;    
 nettles. The ground belongs to the    
 Cricket Club and is used for hockey in
 the winter &amp; the pavilion for card    
 games.                                
 The area has lots of{trees}and        
{wildlife:}birds, squirrels, foxes     
 &amp;  hedgehogs. The people are very     
 friendly and helpful.                 
                                       
 Within easy walking &amp; cycling distance
 we have the sports centre, town       
 centre, Barossa Common, Watchetts Park
 &amp;{Lake}&amp; the cinema.                  </content>
