		<title>03  Radcot Bridge, Part 2</title>
		<content>                                       
 Radcot Bridge is notorious to traffic 
whether on road or on water! The road  
approach from the north, after Pidnell 
Bridge, is steep and angled, the       
bridges themselves are narrow and      
humpbacked, single line traffic only.  
 The main bridge also causes problems  
to river navigation.It is probably one 
of the most hazardous on the river,    
being very narrow and at an angle, with
extra difficulties from both current   
and wind.                              
 Radcot was the scene of conflict on at
least three occasions in the past. It  
was the site of a battle during the    
Civil War and another in 1387. There   
are earthworks still visible, to the   
north of the bridges, remains of the   
Garrison built by Matilda in 1141 and  
remains of even older wharves.
