		<content>   East from the ancient market town{  
 of{Ringwood,}the land rises from a    
 mere 20 metres above sea level to     
 about 90 metres. That is, from the    
 alluvium and gravel bedded valley of  
 the{River Avon}up on to the{New Forest
{Plateau.}                             
   Post 2nd World War housing occupies 
 much of our area's valley floor and   
 the remaining wide sweep of{agricultu-
{ral land}between Eastfield and Nouale 
 Lanes is currently scheduled for{     
{housing}and{industrial development.}  
   Several of our farms abut the Forest
 and some have{"common rights"}attached
 - to{pasture}cattle and ponies on the 
 Forest and also pigs during the{      
{pannage}season (as specifically       
 approved by{William 1st}in{1079}).    
   55% of our area lies within the {   
{"perambulation"} of the{New Forest}   
 which is administered from{Lyndhurst.}</content>
