		<content> The gravel pit was first quarried in  
 l935 by the owner's grandfather and is
 roughly half-way through its          
 productive life. It covers an area of 
 120 acres including 12 buildings which
 are used for offices and maintenance  
 workshops where 55 workers are        
 employed.The pit is 105 acres and as  
 each hole is worked out it is then    
 filled in with waste and reclaimed for
 agriculture. The washing process is   
 done in a closed system but any extra 
 water needed is taken from (nearby)   
 Whitemere.  Of the 3 grades of sand   
 deposited in this process grade 1 is  
 particularly suitable for hospital    
 floor screed and airport runways where
 maximum vibrations occur as the planes
 take off.
