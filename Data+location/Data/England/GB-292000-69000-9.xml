		<title>09 NESS HOUSE-A LOCAL BUSINESS</title>
		<content>   Ness House was built for Lord       
Clifford as a holiday residence. He    
then sold it to Teignmouth (later Teign
-bridge) Council in the 1950s. They    
leased it out and it wasa run as a     
hotel for over 25 years.               
   Now it is the Ness House Inn and it 
is no longer run as a hotel because it 
is not feasable as it only has 8 bed-  
rooms. It has recently been extended to
included a resturant. Upstairs the new 
owners hope to build a large function  
room by knocking several rooms into    
one. They may have difficulties as Ness
House is a grade "A" listed building.  
The new owners acquired the building by
auction, paying 155,000 pounds.        
   There is a beer garden at the back  
and a garden a around the side with    
tables and a car park. From the gardens
there is a good view of the Ness.
