		<title>14THE QUARRY</title>
		<content> The quarry at Kilmington digs for     
 gravel.   Part of the ground is worked
 out, and a local farmer uses it for   
 grazing.   There is also a big pond,  
 which is the result of quarrying.  It 
 provides a habitat for a lot of wild  
 life.   We have seen rabbits and      
 foxes, and men go there to shoot      
 ducks.   Now the quarry is extending  
 further north-east.                   
 Different grades of gravel are        
 excavated, from fine to course.   The 
 largest stone they have dug up is on  
 display at the gate to the quarry.    
 They produce 2 grades of sand. They   
 import fine pit sand (yellow &amp; white) 
 and blocks 3"to 9". Also they import  
 2 grades of scalpings. The company is 
 called E.C.C.(which stands for        
 ENGLISH CHINA CLAY).  ECC have many   
 quarries.   The head office is at     
 Exeter.                               </content>
