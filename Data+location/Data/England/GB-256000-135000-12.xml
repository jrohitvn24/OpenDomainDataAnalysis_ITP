		<title>12HUNTING</title>
		<content> A{fox hunt}is when people chase foxes 
 on horse back and try to kill it by   
 shooting at it. When a fox is found   
 and killled it is fed to the hounds   
 that have helped in the killing.      
 People in the area of Shirwell have   
 been intrested in fox hunting for many
 years and if you own a horse then you 
 can take part and most people do.     
   The hunt usually goes on in the     
 Autumn about once a week.And there is 
 a small charge of Â£1 per person which 
 pays for the hounds food,the lorry to 
 transport them and for the master of  
 the hunt.                             
   Usually about 20 people come to the 
 hunt and some people stay just to     
 watch but they don't always stay      
 to the finish of the hunt because     
 little chilren can get bored and their
 parents get hungry.
