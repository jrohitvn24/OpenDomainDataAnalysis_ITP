		<title>11FARM WORK IN SUTTON VENY</title>
		<content>   My Dad is a farm worker.The farm has
 cattle, sheep and calves.  It grows   
 crops and hay for the animals.  There 
 are some big and small fields and     
 buldings.  In one building they store 
 the crops, in another tractors and in 
 another they put sheep at lambing     
 time.  My Dad drives the tractor to   
 the fields.                           
                                       
   In the winter his job is ploughing  
 and sowing the fields and then spray- 
 indg them.It takes about three months 
 and then the crops start to grow.     
                                       
   In July we start the harvest.My Dad 
 leaves home at 7.45 am and takes a box
 with his breakast in.  He gets home   
 about 8 pm. Sometimes my brother and I
 go with him.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
