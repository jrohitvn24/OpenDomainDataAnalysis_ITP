		<title>13   A Normal School Day</title>
		<content> I got up at 7.30 a.m. and put my radio
 on. When I had dressed, I went into   
 our Leah's room and told her to get   
 up. My breakfast was on the table when
 I came down stairs. At 8.45 a.m. I    
 called for Vanessa and we went to     
 School for registration.  Mr. Webster 
 took us for English until 10.25 when  
 we went out to play.                  
 For the rest of the morning we had    
 maths with Mr. McMillan and art and   
 craft with Mrs. Sheridon. I went home 
 for dinner and called for Vanessa at  
 1.10.  We played skipping in the play 
 ground until afternoon school at 1.30.
 Mr. McMillan took us for social       
 studies and then we had games with Mrs
 Sheridon. We larked "rounders".  At   
 3.30 I went home and played out until 
 5.30 when I had my tea. In the evening
 I watched Coronation Street and Dallas
 on TV before going to bed at 10.30 pm.</content>
