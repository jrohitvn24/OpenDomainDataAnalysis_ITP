		<content> THE POPULATION OF THE NORTHWICH BLOCK 
 HAS FOR MANY YEARS BEEN A VERY        
 CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITY.BECAUSE OF THE   
 AVAILABILITY OF WORK AT THE SALT WORKS
 AND AT THE ICI CHEMICAL WORKS,THERE   
 HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT OF THE  
 POPULATION IN THE PAST.THIS HAS LED TO
 CLOSE FAMILY LINKS IN THE BLOCK WITH  
 MANY GENERATIONS LIVING IN CLOSE      
 PROXIMITY. MORE RECENTLY,HOWEVER,WITH 
 A DECLINE IN THE SALT INDUSTRY AND    
 WITH MOVEMENT OF ICI TO A MORE        
 EFFICIENT LOCATION AT RUNCORN,THERE   
 HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE MOVEMENT OF THE 
 POPULATION.MUCH OF IT HAS BEEN AWAY   
 FROM NORTHWICH TO THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
 FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL TREND.THIS HAS 
 BEEN COUNTERED BY A MOVEMENT OF THE   
 POPULATION FROM THE CITY AREAS OF     
 LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER.MANY PEOPLE  
 WHO LIVE IN NORTHWICH COMMUTE DAILY TO
 WORK IN THESE CITIES.                 </content>
