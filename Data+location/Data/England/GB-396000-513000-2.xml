		<content>    My house is in the middle of the   
 village.It is a quiet village now the 
 by-pass has been built as no traffic  
 passes through.I usually wake up at   
 8:00 a.m.,have my breakfast,get washed
 and dressed then do a few jobs before 
 I go to school at 9:30 a.m.           
    We have assembly and then go to our
 work.The lessons I like best are      
 P.E.(Physical Education)and History   
 with Mrs. Fraser the Headmistress,Art 
 with Mrs. Whitfield and English and   
 History with Ms. Blakemore.           
    We have a school field where the   
 boys play football and the girls play 
 rounders.We have dinner in the canteen
 at 12:30 p.m.,there are three dinner  
 ladies.Altogether there are three     
 proper playtimes.We join in           
 competitions and festivals and sports 
 with other schools and also have our  
 own school sports.                    </content>
