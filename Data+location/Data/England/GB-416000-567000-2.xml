		<content>   We interviewed two people who have  
 lived in Westerhope all of their      
 lives, Mrs Heppell and Mrs Robson. We 
 found out that they both had similar  
 views about the old and new           
 Westerhope.                           
   Westerhope had very few houses      
 earlier in the 1900's and no large    
 housing estates. This meant that most 
 of the land was used for farming but  
 there were also some large            
 market gardens.                       
   The old Westerhope was much quieter 
 with no vandalism while Westerhope    
 today has some vandalism and          
 Stamfordham Road is a busy and noisy  
 main road. They both thought that the 
 people were closer and friendlier in  
 the old Westerhope.                   
   The new Westerhope however, does    
 have lots of modern facilities which  
 weren't there in the past.            </content>
