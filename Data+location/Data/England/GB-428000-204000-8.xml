		<content>{Farmers}expressed concern that they   
 sometimes suffered unfairly from{     
{public criticism}and they welcomed the
 chance to show groups of children     
 around their farms and explain how    
 they reared animals and grew crops.   
 They felt that the use of{chemicals,  
 within government guildlines,         
 improved their productivity and       
 controlled pests.{Straw burning}was   
 unpopular in the town but was done    
 because there was no market for straw 
 and it did not rot easily when        
 ploughed into clay. They were trying  
 to preserve{hedges}and replant{trees  
 in the area. We noticed some{footpaths
 had been absorbed into{arable}land but
 access was usually possible along the 
 hedgerows. Our visits gave us the     
 opportunity to see, touch and smell   
 the animals. One group even had the   
 thrill of seeing a piglet born!       </content>
