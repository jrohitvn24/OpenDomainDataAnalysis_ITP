{school.}The school is called Bolton by
 Bowland C.E ,there are 29 pupils from 
 4 to 11 years.In the Infants are the  
 under eights with one teacher and the 
 over eights are in the other          
 classroom.The cook makes dinners for  
 Gisburn School helped by another      
 lady.There is also a caretaker,a clerk
 and an ancillary helper who helps with
 art work and goes to help at the      
 swimming baths.                       
 Some children come more than 3 miles  
 to school.In the winter the school is 
 sometimes closed because of snowdrifts
 or because the power lines have come  
 down.When the pupils are eleven they  
 have to sit an examination which helps
 to decide whether they go to the      
{secondary school}at Grindleton or the 
 grammar school in Clitheroe.
