		<title>14Punkey Night in 1985</title>
		<content> Nowadays our children collect money   
 by selling 5 penny tickets in the     
 village and those who sell the most   
 become Punkie King and Queen, Prince  
 and Princess for a year. On punkie    
 night the winners are driven through  
 the street on a decorated float pulled
 by a tractor. The other children carry
 lanterns behind, which are made to    
 look like faces called 'Punkies' and  
 singing a song. Later at the village  
 hall, the king, queen, prince and     
 princess are crowned and the punkies  
 are judged and prizes given. Games and
 fun follow this. Money is collected.
