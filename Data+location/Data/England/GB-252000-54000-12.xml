		<content>   Saltram House is a Stately Home     
 owned by the {National Trust. }It     
 stands in a large area of land on the 
 west of the area. Saltram House and   
 Park are open to the public. People   
 enjoy seeing the rooms and the        
 gardens. The house is full of lovely  
 furniture and pictures. Outside the   
 house there are attractive gardens,   
 grazing and woodlands.                
   Stag Lodge stands by one of the     
 gates leading into Saltram Park. It   
 used to be the house of the gate      
 keeper.                               
   Outside Saltram Park, but still     
 inside the city boundary there is     
 a large expanse of farmland. This     
 consists in the main of rough grazing,
 but with arable crops and woodland.   
   There are China Clay works and a    
 stone quarry belonging to English     
 China Clay.                           </content>
