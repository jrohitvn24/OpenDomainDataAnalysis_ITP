		<title>19UPWOOD MANOR (PART 4)</title>
		<content> There are some fascinating things     
 about Upwood Manor. During renovation 
 old coins were found hidden between   
 the walls together with some          
 paintings. The builders added some    
 modern coins and hid them all again.  
 There is also supposed to be a ghost  
 there. The story goes that the owner  
 of the house, who happened to be      
 second-in-command to Lord Nelson,     
 would not let his daughter marry the  
 man she wanted to. He went away to sea
 and got killed in a battle. At        
 precisely the same moment that he died
 his ghost appeared at Upwood Manor to 
 tell his daughter that she could marry
 the man after all. Some people say    
 that he still makes appearances every 
 now and again.
