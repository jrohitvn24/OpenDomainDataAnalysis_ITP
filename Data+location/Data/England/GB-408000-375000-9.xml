  After the judges had given prizes to 
 the winners of the competitions,I had 
 two goes on the Treasure Map. Then I  
 spent about three pounds on the       
 Tombola.At first I only won tins of   
 food like tomatoes and beefburgers,but
 later on I thought I would chance     
 another go.So I did,and I won a bottle
 of wine.I went to show my mum.She was 
 in school near the refreshment stall  
 supping coffee with my Nana and       
 Grandma.I showed everybody and then   
 mum looked after it for me.I went     
 outside to play on some of the other  
 stalls.                               
  Later Bill Waddington went home and  
 so did we.
