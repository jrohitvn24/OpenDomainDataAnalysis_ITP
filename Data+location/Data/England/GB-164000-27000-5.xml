		<title>05TREGARRICK FARM</title>
		<content> Slightly bigger than most in the area,
 Tregarrick is a typical dairy/arable  
 farm of 228 acres. Friesian and       
 Hereford breeds provide the milking   
 herd of 70 cows and various younger   
 stock. They are milked twice daily in 
 a herring bone parlour giving 350,000 
 litres of milk annually.              
       The crops, of grass for hay and 
 silage and barley for cattle feed,    
 make the farm almost entirely self    
 sufficient.                           
       The various stages of milk      
 production call for a wide range of   
 expensive machinery to be used on the 
 farm including three tractors.        
       The farm has been in the same   
 family for three generations. The     
 farmer told us that technology now    
 plays a great part in modern farming, 
 although the E.E.C. calls for less    
 intensive production in the future.   </content>
