		<content>{Spillers}Pet Food factory makes dog   
 biscuits called{Bonio}and{Winalot}and 
 we saw how these are made during our  
 visit. The biscuits are made from     
 flour, tallow, molasses and water,    
 with added vitamins and minerals. The 
 factory uses{computers}to measure out 
 these ingredients in the correct      
 amounts and then it is all mixed up in
 huge revolving containers. It is then 
 pushed between rollers, cut into      
 shapes, and baked in huge ovens. We   
 saw how they packed their biscuits. It
 is all done by machine with women     
 guiding and checking for any problems.
 They even have a machine that uses    
 X-rays to look for any metal that may 
 have got in by accident. We were all  
 given a box of Bonio as a free sample 
 when we left.
