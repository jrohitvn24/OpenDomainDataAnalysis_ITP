 John Lewis has lived in Balcombe all  
 his life.He was a pupil at Balcombe   
 School and then at Warden Park before 
 becoming a gamekeeper at the age of   
 15.He is married to Joyce and has     
 three children, Stephen 11, Joanne 8  
 and Gemma 5.All three children attend 
 Balcombe School.Being a gamekeeper is 
 a very busy occupation.A gamekeeper's 
 year begins in February when he       
 catches all the cock and hen pheasants
 ready for breeding.Also in February   
 and throughout March he shoots and    
 traps vermin, which are foxes,jays,   
 minks,magpies and squirrels.He shoots 
 these animals and birds because they  
 would probably kill the pheasants     
 especially the young ones.
