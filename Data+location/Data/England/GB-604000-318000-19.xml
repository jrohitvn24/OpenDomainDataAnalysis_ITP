		<title>19Sparham Pools</title>
		<content> Sparham Pools Nature Reserve is owned 
 by Major Sayer, a local resident and  
 keen advocate of conservation of      
 wildlife, who leases this disused     
 gravel pit to the Norfolk Naturalists 
 Trust. This Trust first became        
 interested when the Little Ring Plover
 was found to have chosen this site as 
 one of the first places in Britain to 
 nest. Two islands have been cleared   
 bare to successfully provide nesting  
 sites for Common Terns, it is also an 
 important place for migrating birds,  
 e.g. Sandpiper, Greenpiper and Oyster 
 Catcher. Kingfisher and Osprey are    
 other interesting visitors. The nearby
 conifer wood is the location of a     
 Heronry of 12 nests the young from    
 which use the pool to fish. The Warden
 keeps the site in good repair and     
 gives guided tours to parties from the
 Trust and Young Ornithologists Club.  </content>
