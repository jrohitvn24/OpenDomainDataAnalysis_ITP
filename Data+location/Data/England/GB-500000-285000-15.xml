		<title>15BARNWELL PARK - TREES</title>
		<content>   The park is about 50% trees and     
 other vegetation, and 50% water.      
 Examples of the trees found there are 
 white willow. oak and beech. The      
 white willow is found next to the     
 water. Some of the trees have fencing 
 around them to protect them from      
 animals chewing them. There is a lot  
 of rough vegetation which is kept     
 uncut so that insects and animals can 
 hide and be in the shade. The grass is
 cut regularly on the meadows and on   
 the paths by the warden, Neil Lister, 
 although they sometimes get a bit     
 muddy. A lot of the trees have nesting
 boxes in them which are numbered.     
 There is also a tree planting         
 programme eg.Watch Spinney on the west
 edge planted by the{Oundle}Watch Group
 in March 1983. Willow trees are also  
 coppiced to form a screen around the  
 lake and to hide the A605.            </content>
