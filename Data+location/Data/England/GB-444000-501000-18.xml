		<title>18Tourism, Swainby &amp; Potto</title>
		<content> Swainby has always attracted tourists,
 - day trippers and holiday visitors.  
 Today it is a popular starting point  
 for{ramblers and walkers}who leave    
 their cars and head for the hills. The
 National Park Authority provides a map
 of the area. Cleveland Way walkers    
 sometimes break their route here.     
 Children from Carlton Outdoor Centre  
 often walk to Swainby. On fine Sundays
 people come out to enjoy the scenery. 
 Local shops benefit from tourism but  
 there is no teashop; two of the inns  
 serve coffee and bar meals. On the A19
 at Trenholme there are 2 motorway-type
 eating places, and Potto Hall and the 
 "Dog and Gun" offer accommodation and 
 restaurant service. One{caravan site} 
 in Swainby has 64 vans; another caters
 for touring vans and campers.         
 Trenholme has 2 small caravan sites   
 with application to extend.           </content>
