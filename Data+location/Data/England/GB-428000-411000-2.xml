		<title>02Woolley C.E.First School.</title>
		<content> Woolley School is old.It was built    
 in 1842 and had three teachers_two    
 lady teachers and the headmaster.     
 The benches they used were joined to  
 little wooden desks.They used slates  
 and chalk to write with.              
    Now the school has been modernised 
 and we have a mobile classroom for the
 juniors.It came in two bits on two    
 trucks.I was five or six when it came.
 The men made a rest to support the    
 classroom. The juniors could not go in
 until it was decorated. Then we all   
 celebrated with a drink of orange     
 juice and a biscuit.                  
    I think it was a good idea to have 
 an extra classroom. Now we have sixty-
 two children we need it.
