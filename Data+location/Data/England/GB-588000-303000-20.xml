		<title>20FINAL OVERALL VIEW OF ASHILL</title>
		<content>{Ashill}being a typical Norfolk village
 is basically self sufficient with its 
 varied retail outlets including a     
 butchers, frozen food shop, general   
 stores, farm shop (selling milk),     
 market garden and an electrical shop. 
 A fresh fish van, fish and chip van,  
 milk float, bakers van and mobile     
 library visit the village regularly.  
 In this project we have tried to      
 portray Ashill as a lively and        
 interesting village to live in as this
 is how we see ourselves. Parents      
 "complain" of being taxi drivers for  
 children and adults comment that they 
 never have time to do all they wish.  
 Two organisations not mentioned       
 elsewhere are{The Royal British Legion
 branch and the{Village Trustees}that  
 oversee the village green, pond and   
 other legacies left to the village.
