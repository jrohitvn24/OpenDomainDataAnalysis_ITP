		<title>10Ringmer Roads and Footpaths</title>
		<content>{Ringmer}has a straight road running   
 right through the centre of it. It    
 seems as if Ringmer is two separate   
 villages. Off the main road are       
 several wandering lanes which run     
 through countryside or new housing    
 estates. Some of the roads are named  
 after famous Ringmer people such as{  
{Springett, Harvard, Penn}and{Christie.
 Ringmer is a good place for cycling   
 because the village is quite flat. If 
 you are travelling by foot there are  
 many shortcuts called by the old      
{Sussex}name of{"twitten".}There are   
 many well marked footpaths preserved  
 by the{Lewes Footpaths Group.}Most of 
 the footpaths run through farmland or 
 downland.
