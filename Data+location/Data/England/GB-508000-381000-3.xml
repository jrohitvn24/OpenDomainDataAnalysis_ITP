		<title>03HOLTON: POPULATION.JOBS</title>
		<content> The hamlet of Holton is the smallest  
 of the 3 villages in the block.The    
 Anglican Church and Holton Hall are   
 the 2 largest buildings.The former is 
 partly 12th century. The Hall is an   
 18th C.Georgian house extended in     
 Victorian times by the addition of 4  
 bays.Population of Holton consists of 
 28 households.There are 10 children   
 under 18,35 working people,13         
 retired.There are 6 council houses,   
 the rest are owner occupied.There are 
 2 working farmers.Other employment    
 includes architecture,teaching,nursing
 and 2 full time artists.People enjoy  
 living here although the amount of    
 heavy traffic passing through is      
 destroying the peaceful atmosphere of 
 a village which was totally           
 agricultural in former times.
