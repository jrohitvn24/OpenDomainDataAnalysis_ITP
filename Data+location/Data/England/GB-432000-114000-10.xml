		<content>   They have offices there and deal    
 with bulk storage,bottling,warehousing
 and transport arrangements for the    
 group.{Wine and Sherry is blended and 
{bottled here and as much as 250,000   
{gallons are exported to Europe and    
{America each year.}The bonded         
 warehouses and bottling halls are     
 located behind the houses where       
 extensions have been made without     
 spoiling the 18th century facade and  
 beautiful gardens.{60 people are      
{employed in the warehouses and 25 in  
{the offices.}150 years ago,a coachman 
 brutally murdered a cook at Testwood  
 House,and tried to hide her body in a 
 pond at the end of Cooks Lane.{The    
{ghost of the man is said to haunt the 
{house and has been seen several times 
{especailly when the 20th of the Month 
{occurs on a Wednesday!!!. }
