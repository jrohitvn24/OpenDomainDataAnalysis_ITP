		<title>19BARROW CIVIC SOCIETY</title>
		<content> Many Civic Societes are concerned only
 with buildings but the Barrow Society 
 is interested in both the natural and 
 man made environment. Its aims include
 fostering an interest in the village's
 past so that the buildings of previous
 generations are appreciated, preserved
 and where necessary, restored;        
 ensuring that careless modern         
 development does not take place and   
 disseminating information about       
 Barrow's past, which extends at least 
 as far back as Roman times. The       
 Society is concerned also with the    
 natural environment and wishes to     
 encourage people to make the most of  
 the country and riverside. It believes
 in the importance of trees and        
 hedge rows in achieving  a balanced   
 landscape and would like to see       
 further tree planting in this rather  
 treeless area of England.             </content>
