		<title>10OLD PEOPLE IN WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   There is a high proportion of older 
 people in Upper Waddington. They      
 prefer to live there rather than Lower
 Waddington because it is peaceful,    
 friendly and near to the countryside. 
   Many retired members of the R.A.F.  
 live there.                           
   There  are several clubs which older
 people might join, such as the Bowls  
 Club, the Gardeners Club and the      
 Sunshine Club.                        
   The Sunshine Club meet twice per    
 month. They show movies, organise     
 excursions and hold parties on        
 peoples' birthdays.                   
   At Easter they  have an Easter      
 bonnet parade.                        
   The steep hill causes some problems 
 in moving freely between upper and    
 lower Waddington for some old         
 people, though there are three fairly 
 good bus services into Lincoln.       </content>
