		<title>12THE "OO" RAILWAY, EXMOUTH</title>
		<content> The "00" railway was begun in 1956 by 
 Gerry Nicholson. It took 14 years to  
 build. It opened in 1970. It was only 
 a small track at the time. Now there  
 are 7,500ft of track. The track is    
 being extended outside around a dock. 
 The dock is an attractive pool with   
 chinese fish in it. If it rains, the  
 trains will just turn around in the   
 porch and go back inside the building.
 20 trains can run on the track at any 
 one time. The fastest train was       
 damaged before it could go on the     
 track. The trains range from steam to 
 diesel but all the other trains can   
 outrun the "intercity 125." When 3    
 trains were racing around the track at
 3 or 4 M.P.H they look very fast. I   
 thought they would crash. Instead they
 intermeshed, seperated and raced in   
 different directions. I think it is a 
 good place to take children.          </content>
