		<title>12GARBOLDISHAM VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content>   The village hall, funded by local   
 benefactors and by public donation,   
 was built soon after W.War 2 on land  
 given by the owner of "The Hall".     
 Replacing a corrugated iron reading   
 room, it is of brick and asbestos roof
 const. and has hall, kitchen, toilets 
 and annexe. There is a portable stage 
 but plans exist for a permanent stage 
 and changing rooms in due course.     
   Hire{CHARGES}are on a sliding       
 scale; lowest for local clubs, highest
 for commercial use (Auctions etc) with
 local fund raising in between. The    
 floor is set out for badminton and the
 hall is used for carpet bowls, plays, 
 dancing, concerts, etc., by the local 
{CLUBS}and for private bookings.       
   A Village Hall Management{COMMITTEE 
 has the usual officers and members    
 plus representatives from local       
 organisations.                        </content>
