		<content>{The Glen}is a popular place for walks.
 People come here at weekends and have 
 done for years.When workers from the  
 mills around Bradford only had a day {
 or two holiday they came by tram to   
 Saltaire to walk up the Glen.From {   
{Saltaire Road}a bridge crosses{Loadpit
{Beck}then a track leads into some     
 dis-used stone quarries.The beck runs 
 through{a steep valley covered with   
{trees}like oak,silver birch,and beech 
 on the banks.Then it reaches a small  
{reservoir},shaped like a triangle.This
 measured 16m50 cm along the bottom and
 22m 50cm on one side.It was once used 
 for supplying the dye house at Salts  
 Mill.Huge,flat-topped rocks are all   
 along one bank of the beck.These are  
 called Brackenhall Crags.They are near
 to{Glen Road}and the moors.This Glen  
 was made in the{Ice Age}long ago by   
 ice carving into the rock.            </content>
