		<content> The lanes and surrounding fields      
 abound in rich vegetation and wild    
 life. Since the farmers' awareness of 
 the affect of weedkillers and         
 insecticides on plants and animals,   
 greater control is practised and this 
 year has seen an abundance of         
 primroses, foxgloves, campions, vetch,
 scabious, poppies and numerous other  
 wild flowers; though the poor summer  
 appears to have affected the butterfly
 population. Thick hedges and copses   
 shelter a wide variety of birds and   
 small animals. Foxes, badgers,        
 roedeer, hedgehogs, hares, owls and   
 toads are among the area's            
 inhabitants, as well as large numbers 
 of rooks, woodpigeons, moles and      
 rabbits. There are wild fowl and duck 
 on the winterbourne.
