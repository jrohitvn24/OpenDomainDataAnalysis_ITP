		<title>18THE POLICEMAN,HACKFORTH</title>
		<content> Our local policeman is called P.C.    
 Martin. He looks after 9 other        
 villages as well as Hackforth.These   
 are Thornton Watlass,Thirn,Newton-le- 
 Willows, Patrick Brompton, Crakehall, 
 Cowling and Burrill, Langthorne,      
 Hackforth and Hornby.He lives at      
 Crakehall.He moves round his beat in a
 car and he carries with him a radio   
 repeater.This means he can work away  
 from the car but the police can still 
 contact him.His base police station is
 at Bedale.He drives between 5O to 6O  
 miles a day in his car.His patch deals
 with about 45 crimes a year.Most of   
 this is petty theft.Each village      
 policeman has in his home a special   
 telephone for early warning in case of
 nuclear alerts.
