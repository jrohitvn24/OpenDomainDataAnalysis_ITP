		<title>09GOXHILL MEMORIAL HALL.</title>
		<content> The Memorial Hall was built by public 
 subscription as a memorial to those   
 men of the village who lost their     
 lives in the First World War. It was  
 opened by Sir Berkley Sheffield on 7th
 March, 1925. Set in the front of the  
 hall are plaques bearing the names of 
 those who died in both the First and  
 Second World Wars. At first the       
 Memorial Hall was run by a committee, 
 then by the Parish Council who        
 returned the running of the building  
 to a committee over twelve years ago. 
 The Hall is a registered charity which
 is self financing. So great is the    
 Hall's use that it was necessary to   
 extend the width of the Hall by the   
 addition of wings at each side. Set in
 its own grounds the Memorial Hall has 
 its own tennis court which was        
 recently resurfaced.
