		<title>18Codnor Gate Industrial Est.</title>
		<content>   The industrial estate is actually in
 Ripley on three roads, High Holborn   
 Road,Brittain Drive and Forty Horse   
 Close. There are twenty units. Ten    
 companies actually make things there  
 and the others provide services,      
 finish off products made elsewhere or 
 store goods to be sent to shops.      
   The Nuthall Lighting Company also   
 sends materials out to people for them
 to make lampshades at home.           
   I think two factories are empty     
 because they have gone bankrupt, but  
 there is still space to build more    
 factories. I think it is a good idea  
 to have factories on an estate        
 away from houses because of the smoke,
 noise and traffic they cause. I don't 
 find it an attractive place, but I    
 like the Riley Dental Laboratories'   
 building best because of the          
 brickwork.                         {AA</content>
