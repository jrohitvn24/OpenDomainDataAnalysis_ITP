		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KATE -1</title>
		<content>  Mum wakes me up at 7.30am and she    
 brings me a cup of tea. I drink it    
 slowly, get up, get dressed and go    
 down to{breakfast.}I have{cereal      
 mostly Coco Pops or frosties. Then I  
 go to see my ponies and give them a   
 few titbits and muck them out. I brush
 my hair then say goodbye to my brother
 James who goes to{school}at 8.00am.   
 Then I do my piano practise for ten   
 minutes. I clean my teeth, wash my    
 face then to to school on the bus.    
 When we arrive at school we stay      
 outside for a while then the bell     
 rings and we go in class for{lessons. 
 Mrs. Pickford discusses our work      
 schedules, writes on the board what we
 have got to do that day then start    
 working on our various activities.    
 10.25am We go out to play for 15      
 minutes. I play with Michelle and a   
 few others and we just watch the boys </content>
