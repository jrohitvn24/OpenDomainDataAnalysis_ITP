		<title>06SMUGGLING IN THE W WIGHT</title>
		<content>  From early in the 17th century,      
 smuggling has been a worthwhile       
 occupation in the West Wight.The      
 coastline is jagged with a reef of    
 hidden rocks beneath the surface of   
 the water around the Needles point.It 
 is a well known fact that brandy was  
 brought into and hidden in caves for  
 later transportation by donkey along  
 the muddy tracks to isolated farms in 
 the West Wight.Here it was hidden     
 until it was needed.As late as the    
 19th century,smuggling was still found
 and many of the descendants of these  
 families still live here.It is a known
 fact that one of the very first       
 lighthouse keepers, Mr Isaacs, was    
 attacked by smugglers and thrown to   
 his death over Scratchells Bay.The new
 lighthouse was rebuilt on the end of  
 the rocks in 1858.
