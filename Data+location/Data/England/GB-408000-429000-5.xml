		<content> The oldest part of the mill was built 
 in 1832 by John Foster. It is still   
 owned by his descendants, some  of    
 whom work there. Originally about 200 
 people worked there. Now 729 are      
 employed on many different shifts:    
 about 50% live in Queensbury.         
 The mill produces about 400 pieces of 
 cloth, of various lengths, per week.  
 They produce (flannel, mohair, wool   
 and (worsted:) 80% of this is         
 exported. They import most of their   
 raw materials, the most important of  
 which is goat hair from Turkey and    
 South Africa. After many processes it 
 is woven into (the finest mohair in   
 the world.) It is famous throughout   
 the world and especially popular in   
 Japan.                                
 Many people come to Queensbury to buy 
 direct from the (Black Dyke Mill Shop.
