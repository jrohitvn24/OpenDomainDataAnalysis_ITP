		<content> Not many people are employed in the   
 village of Bishop Middleham itself.   
 There is some work, in the small      
 clothing factory, the pie factory, the
 shops and the pubs but most people    
 travel to the larger towns and cities 
 for their employment.                 
                                       
 Many of the villagers are employed in 
 the engineering and electrical        
 industries in the towns of Stockton,  
 Teesside, Sunderland and Newcastle.   
                                       
 There is not much unemployment among  
 the villagers of Bishop Middleham, but
 school leavers are finding it         
 increasingly difficult to find work.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
