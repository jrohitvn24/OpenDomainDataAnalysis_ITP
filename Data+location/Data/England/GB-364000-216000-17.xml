		<title>17MITCHELDEAN NATURE RESERVES</title>
		<content>    There are two nature reserves in   
 the Mitcheldean area, quite different 
 in character from each other.         
    A layer of clay, thought by        
 geologists to have been deposited     
 during the Ice Age on the plateau-like
 summit of Plump Hill has produced some
 natural ponds with surrounding        
 "wetland", due to its impervious      
 character. This is an important refuge
 for bog plants.                       
    Nearer Mitcheldean is the abandoned
 Stenders quarry, with both            
 Carboniferous and Devonian rocks      
 exposed due to the steep angle of dip.
 Both formations contain fossils, and  
 there are wild flowers of both the    
 limestone and sandstone rocks, while  
 the quarry is also a refuge for       
 badgers, foxes and ravens.
