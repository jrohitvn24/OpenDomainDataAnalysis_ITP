		<title>11TOWN TWINNING</title>
		<content>    Hillingdon is linked with the towns
 of Emden and Schleswig in West Germany
 and with Mantes-la-jolie in France.   
 Mantes and Schleswig were first linked
 with Hayes and Harlington in 1958 and 
 Emden with Uxbridge 3 years later. The
 3 continental towns were twinned with 
 the Borough of Hillingdon on its      
 formation in 1965. In Hillingdon      
 French and German is taught in many   
 schools and further education classes 
 encourage adults to take up this new  
 interest. Many exchange visits with   
 schools have taken place between      
 Hillingdon and its twin town over a   
 number of years. Educational and youth
 visits in particlar have proved       
 exteremely popular but there are many 
 other exchanges which will be         
 involving adults.
