		<title>16A NEW HOUSING ESTATE part 2</title>
		<content>      They use concrete,sand,wood,glue,
 plasterboard,about 2,700litres of     
 water and about 15,000 bricks for     
 every large house.                    
      They need planners,architects,   
 ground workers,bricklayers,plumbers,  
 electricians,joiners,painters,and     
 tilers amongst others.                
      On this estate of 68 houses there
 are 23 different types, all detached  
 except for a block of 11 terraced     
 houses.The average size of the main   
 rooms is about 4m by 4m.The houses    
 cost from about Â£35,000 to Â£130,000.  
      Barrat's think that in the future
 houses will be smaller with features  
 like roofs that open, solar panels on 
 the roofs and walls,swimming pools    
 under folding floors,and most         
 equipment computerised and automatic.
