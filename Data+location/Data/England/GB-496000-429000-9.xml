		<title>09WELTON WOLD FARM.</title>
		<content>  The owner has eight farms altogether 
 and he plans to own another three.    
 Welton Wold Farm is arable but it used
 to have animals. It is eight hundred  
 acres in size and it employs three    
 men. These men's jobs are ploughing   
 fields, planting potatoes and stocking
 up grain in the sheds. They also keep 
 up the roads which are privately owned
 by the farmer. The soil is called Wold
 soil, also known as silted clay. The  
 owner has three thousand acres all    
 together.
