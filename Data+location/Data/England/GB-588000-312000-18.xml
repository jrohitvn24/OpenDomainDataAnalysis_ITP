 IN 1814 JOHN DROSIER, OF CURDS HALL,  
 BEING A FRIEND OF LORD NELSON, HAD THE
 OBALISK BUILT TO MARK THE PEACE OF    
 AMIEN WHEN THE FRENCH WERE BEATEN THE 
 YEAR BEFORE WATERLOO.   NELSON DIED IN
 1805.   THE OBOLISK IS NOW A GRADE 2  
 HISTORICAL MONUMENT AND IS CURRENTLY  
 BEING REPAIRED.                       
                                       
 LOCAL LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE OBOLISK  
 WAS TO MARK THE MEETING PLACE OF LORD 
 NELSON, WHO STAYED AT CURDS HALL, AND 
 LADY HAMILTON, WHO STAYED AT DUBHAM   
 LODGE, WHERE THE TWO BOUNDARIES MET.  
                                       
 CURDS HALL WAS PULLED DOWN AFTER THE  
 SECOND WORLD WAR AS IT WAS IN A STATE 
 OF DISREPAIR.
