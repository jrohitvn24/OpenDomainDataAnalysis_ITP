		<content> We asked 100 families in{Eastern Grn  
 about their employment. There were 215
 adults eligible to work in the motor  
 industry. 57 have at some time worked 
 in the industry, now there are only   
 17. Eastern  Grn. residents use their 
 local shops in Sutton Ave.several     
 times a week but use supermarkets at  
 Cannon Park or in Coventry city for   
 most shopping.Many people like Eastern
 Grn.because it is both near the       
 countryside &amp; the city.               
  Villagers living in{Berkswell}like   
 the friendliness &amp; quietness.The Post 
 Office &amp; shop is used by most at      
 sometime.The supermarkets at Cannon   
 Park, Coventry are often used as there
 is more variety &amp; goods are cheaper.  
   Only 45 attend Sunday services at St
 John's.The Rector is involved with the
 village school &amp; also visits the sick.
