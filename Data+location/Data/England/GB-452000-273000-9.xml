		<content> I walk to school through the waste    
 ground and when I arrive I talk with  
 my friends until it is time to line up
 and go inside.First there is an       
 assignment of work on the board to do 
 while we answer the register.Then we  
 line up for assembly where we sing a  
 hymn.After this the class begin their 
 individual projects written about a   
 particular person or country.At 10a.m.
 we go to the Music/French room.We     
 repeat work we know and then learn new
 words.At 10.30 we go out to play for  
 20 minutes.After play we begin Maths  
 using Fletcher books.We learn about   
 the things that we are not too good at
 Dinnertime begins at 12.15.After      
 dinner we have games.We have the      
 choice of cricket,rounders or volley  
 ball.At 2.30 we look at World         
 Religions.When it is 3.30 we go home.
