		<content>  Apart  from  external  renovation  &amp; 
 internal  modernisation,  much of  the
 old part of{Melsonby}fronting {East &amp; 
{West Roads,  High Row  &amp;  Church Row, 
 remain little  changed from  100 years
 ago.  Some of  this modernisation  has
 been done with the help of  Government
 grants to  owners  during the  past 10
 years.  A small number of  new natural
 stone  dwellings   are   being   built
 opposite  the  Church, some  of  which
 involve  the  conversion  of  old farm
 buildings.                            
  The largest number of new houses have
 or are being built to the South of the
 crossroads,  along{Moor  Road}and{St. 
{James' Close.} These are a  mixture of
 detached  &amp;  semi-detached houses  and
 bungalows  for  private  and   Council
 occupiers  as well as retired peoples'
 bungalows.    Further expansion of the
 village seems likely in the future.   </content>
