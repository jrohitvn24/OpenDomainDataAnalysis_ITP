		<title>08A Day in my Life.</title>
		<content>    The alarm clock goes off at 7.35 am
 and I get up about 7.40 am.  I get    
 dressed, have a quick wash and go     
 downstairs.  I finish breakfast at    
 8.10 am and then I brush my teeth.  At
 about 8.28 am my Mum drops me off at  
 Matthew's house and I walk to school  
 with him.  School starts at 9 am with 
 a twenty-five minute assembly.  After 
 that we have Maths until morning      
 break. After break we have games in   
 which we have a choice of             
 football, rounders, tennis and        
 netball. I usually play football or   
 rounders. After school I watch        
 television and then have my tea. After
 tea, at 7 pm I go to cubs. I go to 3rd
 Hazel Grove "Seneca Cub Pack.  After  
 cubs I go home and go to bed.
