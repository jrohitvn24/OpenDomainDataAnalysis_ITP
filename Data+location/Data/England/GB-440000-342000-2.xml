 Smalley is a linear village which has 
 grown up along the Derby to Heanor    
 road (A 608) at the junction of the   
 road to Kilburn. The houses are mostly
 spread along each side of the main    
 road with fields beyond.              
{HOUSING.                              
 We found there were four types of     
 housing.                              
 1)old terraces of cottages built of   
 brick                                 
 2)larger semi-detached or detached    
 houses built probably in the twentieth
 century of brick and stucco           
 3)a small estate of council houses at 
 the north end of the village, all     
 built of brick                        
 4)a modern development of             
 semi-detached and detached houses and 
 bungalows at the south end of the     
 village, of brick and stone.          </content>
