		<content> There are two schools in 'D' Block,   
 a playgroup held in the old village   
 school and a primary school.Both of   
 these are in Kirklevington Village.The
 old school was built in{1857}at a cost
 of{Â£62.}The money came from the       
 William Hall charity and a cottage was
 built for the headteacher on a site   
 that was once a carpenters shop and a 
 pig sty. This school was used until   
 Kirklevington village grew in size in 
 the early{1970's,}it took 2-13 yr olds
 who were taught in one large room     
 which was heated by a coke boiler.    
 Everyone walked to school and         
 sandwiches were brought for lunch     
 until a canteen was built. In summer  
{1973}the new school took the first of 
 its 130 pupils. The building was      
 extended in{1980.}In{1985}there are   
 five teachers and eight non-teaching  
 staff.                                </content>
