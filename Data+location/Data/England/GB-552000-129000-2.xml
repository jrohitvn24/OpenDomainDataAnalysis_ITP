		<content> Most people live in detached, semi_   
 detached, terraced houses and flats.  
 In Blackness 750 houses have or will  
 be built which will all be privately  
 owned. There are 3 council estates in 
 this area _ Alderbrook, Palesgate Lane
 and Forest Rise. Tenants have recently
 been encouraged to buy their own      
 houses. 32 new homes are being con_   
 structed for private ownership off    
 Eridge Road. It is easier to get      
 planning permission for infilling as  
 it goes to an elected committee at    
 Wealden. An acre of land costs between
 Â£50_100,000 on which approximately ten
 houses can be built or a greater      
 number of flats. In Blackness there   
 are a number of 2_3 storey flats.     
 Rotherfield is a conservation area so 
 no houses may be demolished without   
 permission. 44 Tudor &amp; Sussex houses  
 are being built in Court Meadow.      </content>
