		<content> Every house relies on electricity,    
 brought by overhead cables, for       
 lighting and domestic appliances. In  
 Linkenholt many houses have Rayburns, 
 which burn solid fuel, for cooking    
 and heating water; in Faccombe 2      
 houses use oil, but the rest have wood
 fired central heating. Linkenholt     
 water is from Southern Water mains    
 supply; a bore hole at Faccombe       
 supplies water to Faccombe, Kimmer and
 Netherton. The milkman delivers       
 bottles of milk to the door on        
 Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday;       
 newspapers are delivered daily; the   
 postman delivers and collects twice a 
 day weekdays, once on Saturdays.      
 Vernham Dean Post Office delivers     
 groceries and pensions weekly to      
 old-age pensioners. Most shopping is  
 done in nearby towns. A mobile library
 calls fortnightly.                    </content>
