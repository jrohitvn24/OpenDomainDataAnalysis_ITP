		<content>     In recent years, many hedges have 
 disappeared, victims of the trend     
 towards intensive cereal farming and  
 increased mechanisation.  Farmers view
 this change as an economic necessity, 
 but ecologists deplore the damage to  
 wild-life.   Some local residents     
 feel that the removal of hedges has   
 increased the problem of snow-drifts  
 on minor roads in winter, and cyclists
 regret the loss of an effective       
 wind-break.                           
                                       
     Another practice arousing strong  
 local feeling is stubble-burning.     
 Many residents complain about the     
 inconvenience from smoke and smuts,   
 while farmers argue that, on heavy    
 clay soils, stubble-burning is the    
 only satisfactory method of disposing 
 of waste straw.
