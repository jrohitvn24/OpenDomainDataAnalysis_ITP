{                                      
 Our school has 156 children and 6     
 teachers. The Headteacher is Mr.      
 Downing, the other teachers are       
 Mr.Dobson,Mrs.Robertson, Mrs.Kelly,   
 Mrs.Wilkins and Mrs.Reynoldson. There 
 is a school secretary called Mrs.Scott
 and the caretaker is Mr.Dawson.       
                                       
 The school is in two parts.The old    
 part was built in 1854 and the new    
 part was started in 1962.There are 66 
 children in the new school and 90 in  
 the old school.In the old school there
 are two separate  playgrounds because 
 a long time ago they used to keep the 
 girls separate from the boys.The      
 children's toilets are in the         
 playgrounds.
