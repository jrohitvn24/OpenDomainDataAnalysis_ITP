		<title>13MR.RYAN'S GARAGE</title>
		<content> Ryan's Garage is situated in Mundell  
 Street in South Moor.Mr.Ryan's hours  
 of opening are from 8a.m. to 6.30p.m. 
 six days a week.He is closed all day  
 Sunday.The garage does not sell petrol
 but instead repairs and services all  
 types of motor vehicles.He works alone
 and on average does about 10 cars each
 week.He runs a breakdown service to   
 tow in vehicles which have broken down
 or crashed.Mr.Ryan does Ministry of   
 Transport (M.O.T.) tests on vehicles  
 over 3 years old.He works on both     
 British and foreign cars and considers
 that British cars are better to work  
 on because parts are cheaper and      
 easier to get hold of.
