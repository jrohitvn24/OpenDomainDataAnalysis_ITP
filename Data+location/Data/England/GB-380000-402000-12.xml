		<title>12THE START OF JEWISH SABBATH</title>
		<content>  You wake on Friday to a lovely       
 spirit of preparation for the Sabbath.
 Jewish Schools finish early to prepare
 for the Sabbath. People go to the     
 bakers for special plaited bread and  
 for cake and biscuits. Others bake    
 their own bread during the week. In   
 late afternoon everyone puts on their 
 best clothes and some men go to a     
 ritual bath called a "Mikvah" while   
 the Women lay the table with fine     
 cutlery,candlesticks and goblets.     
                                       
  At dusk, Men go to a Synagogue for   
 the afternoon and evening services    
 which take about an hour, and then    
 return home to the warmth of the      
 family around the beautifully set     
 table. The day is sanctified and all  
 present enjoy a festive meal.
