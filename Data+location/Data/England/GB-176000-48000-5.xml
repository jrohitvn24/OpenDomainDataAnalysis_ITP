		<title>05ALLET NURSERIES, NEAR TRURO.</title>
		<content> Mr.&amp;Mrs.E.own 6 acres of land,of which
 almost 2 acres consist of glasshouses 
 &amp; polythene tunnelling used for the   
 production of salad foods.They work 16
 hours every day,employ 3 full-time &amp; 2
 part-time workers,&amp; produce 1000 dozen
 lettuce per week, as well as tomatoes,
 cucumbers &amp; peppers.  Lettuce only is 
 to be grown in the future to increase 
 efficiency &amp; combat rising costs of   
 fuel &amp; chemicals, which are used to   
 sterilise the soil; although following
 excessive use of chemicals in Holland,
 E.E.C. regulations may mean that more 
 expensive steam sterilisation must be 
 used. Mouse-damage is the biggest pest
 problem, effectively controlled by 6  
 cats.Lettuce are sold by reputation of
 quality &amp; reliability;  no supply     
 contracts are held; they sell locally,
 transport costs being too high when   
 there is no guaranteed minimum return.</content>
