		<title>16A Distict Nurse, Cotteridge</title>
		<content>My Mom, Kate Barton, is a{State        
Enrolled Nurse.}She trained at Selly   
Oak Hospital for 2 years. Following    
another 6 months training she qualified
as a{district nurse.}My Mom started    
nursing in October 1969, because she   
wanted to help people and she thought  
nursing would be a{worthwhile career}. 
My Mom thinks it is enjoyable when she 
sees patients she has nursed, get      
better. However, sometimes she cannot  
nurse people in the community because  
of the lack of equipment. At the moment
my Mom does not work in a hospital ward
she goes round to the peoples' houses. 
My Mom also works at a{Health Centre}  
where she does dressings, injections,  
and takes stitches out. Her patients   
vary from babies to people over 90. She
works a 5 day week with alternate      
weekends and every Wednesday off.
