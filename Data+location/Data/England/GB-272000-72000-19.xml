 provides a tea for Â£1.50 consisting of
 scones, clotted cream,jam,a pot of    
 Indian tea with milk -a china tea set 
 is used. The cottage is thought to be 
 17th.Cent. but the timbers in the loft
 are 15th.Cent.The owner retired from  
 an Art Gallery in London and loves the
 simplicity and softness of life here. 
 Two hundred locals celebrated the 1977
 Jubilee on her lawn which gave rise to
 the idea of a Community Hall. She has 
 raised money for this by holding whist
 drives in her cottage on winter       
 evenings.She does not drive a car. Her
 husband is ill (stroke) and is in     
 Newton Abbot hospital.A baker,butcher,
 fishman and milkman deliver. Friends  
 collect orders from Ashburton and take
 her to a supermarket in Newton Abbot  
 once a month.
