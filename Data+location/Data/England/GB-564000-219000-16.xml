		<content>   There are three places of Christian 
 Worship within Barnston and Little    
 Dunmow, the oldest being Little Dunmow
 Priory which dates back to 1104 and   
 was originally the size of a          
 cathederal.  After the Dissolution of 
 the Monastries only the Lady Chapel   
 was left standing and now serves as   
 the Parish Church known as Saint      
 Mary's.                               
                                       
   Little Dunmow shares a rector with  
 Barnston where the church dates from  
 Norman times and an unusual feature is
 the barrel organ with a repertoire of 
 twelve tunes.  Also in Barnston is the
 Mission Evangelical Church founded at 
 the beginning of this century housed  
 in what was once a "piggery".  There  
 is no minister in charge and the      
 affairs are run by the worshippers.
