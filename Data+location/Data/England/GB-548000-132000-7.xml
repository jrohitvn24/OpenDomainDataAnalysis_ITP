		<content> The two main things done for{leisure  
 are{walking}and{horse riding.}One     
 walk which a lot of people do is      
 what we call the Pooh walk. It is     
 popular because you can take a car    
 some of the way and then walk on to   
 the well known Pooh bridge. Most      
 people go in the morning and take a   
 picnic lunch and play at Pooh sticks. 
 Pooh sticks is a game which A.A.Milne 
 made up when he took his son and teddy
 bear called Pooh to the bridge. They  
 would play Pooh sticks by standing on 
 one side of the bridge and throwing a 
 stick in they would see which stick   
 got to the other side first. There is 
 also a considerable amount of pony    
 riding in the forest. You could ride a
 horse from School Lane to the Five    
 Acre Wood without riding on a main    
 road.
