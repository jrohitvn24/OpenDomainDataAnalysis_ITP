		<title>04LITTLE DEWCHURCH / BOLSTONE</title>
		<content> This is mainly a{farming area,}with   
{Little Dewchurch}as{the only village  
 in it.   The{farms}are fairly         
{scattered,}and have a mixture of      
{cattle, sheep and crops.  }The        
 countryside is quite pretty, with     
{little valleys}and some{very narrow   
{winding roads}with high banks beside  
 them.   The hedges are very neat.   A 
 lot of houses sell things to passers  
 by, such as{Christmas trees, fruit,   
{vegetables and eggs.  }Some of the    
 more remote houses and farms have old 
 cars and pieces of farm equipment     
 rusting in the fields.   The{people}in
 the countryside seem very{different}to
 town people - they are more{self-     
{sufficient and suspicious of          
{strangers.  }Little Dewchurch is not  
 very pretty.   It only has one{public 
{telephone,}and most of the glass in it
 was broken. {The people were nice.    </content>
