		<title>01SOUTH-EAST NORFOLK-A SUMMARY</title>
		<content>   The landscape of East Norfolk evokes
 mixed responses.To some it is flat and
 uninteresting,to others it holds a    
 fascination.The marshlands West of    
 Great Yarmouth are man-made.The Romans
 found a great expanse of shallow sea  
 rather like the present Rhine estuary 
 and built fortifications at Caister to
 the North and Burgh Castle to the     
 South to defend the river route.Over  
 the centuries offshore sandbanks and  
 silt-laden rivers steadily choked the 
 estuary .The skill of 16th Century    
 Dutch refugees produced the present   
 scenery , with its raised river       
 banks;drainage dykes;and now derelict 
 wind pumps. Only isolated dwellings   
 are located on the marshes,nucleated  
 settlements are universally located on
 the higher and drier land.
