		<content>  THE RELIGIOUS NEEDS OF THE           
 PARISHIONERS ARE MET BY THREE PLACES  
 OF WORSHIP. THE BAPTIST CHAPEL        
 (MR.P.STEWARD) IS SITUATED ON THE HIGH
 ST., THE METHODIST CHURCH             
 (MR.A.W.GURRY) IS ON PARKHALL RD. AND 
 THE PARISH CHURCH OF ST.JOHN THE      
 BAPTIST (REV.A.P.LUDLOW) TOWERS OVER  
 THE VILLAGE FROM ITS POSITION NEAR THE
 HEART OF SOMERSHAM ON CHURCH ST.      
  THE (13TH PARISH CHURCH IN THE ELY   
 DIOCESE IS NOW THE MOTHER CHURCH TO   
 THE PARISH CHURCHES OF PIDLEY AND     
 COLNE AND THE RECTOR HOLDS SERVICES IN
 THESE THREE CHURCHES.                 
  THE CUBS, BROWNIES, SCOUTS AND GUIDES
 MAINTAIN LINKS WITH THE CHURCH AS WELL
 AS THE RECENTLY FORMED BOYS BRIGADE. A
 YOUNG CHURCH (SUNDAY SCHOOL) MEETS    
 EACH SUNDAY AND JOINS IN THE SECOND   
 HALF OF THE EUCHARIST HELD AT THE     
 PARISH CHURCH.                        </content>
