		<content>   There is quite a large{movement}of  
 young families into the area 10% of   
 the pupils have one parent who came   
 from Mawnan. There are a wide range of
{occupations},builders,engineers,      
 electicians and farmers being the most
 numerous. The building trade has      
 decreased rapidly in the last few     
 years as there is hardly any new      
 houses being built. Most people work  
 out side the area. In the summer there
 are more jobs available in hotels, in 
 fishing etc. There is a little        
{unemployment}a few schools leavers    
 have been unable to get jobs. Most    
 families  own a{car},mainly the old   
 use the  puplic transport and the     
 under 17's.In school 1\% of families  
 have no car, 2\% no T.V and 4 % no    
 telephone. 35% of people said that a  
{community centre}was needed 32% mainly
 older people said no.                 </content>
