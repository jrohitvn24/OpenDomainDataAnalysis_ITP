		<title>09THE SHORELINE OF ARNE</title>
		<content>   Along the shoreline there is shallow
 brackish water, 0_1.5m in depth, as in
 all parts of Poole Harbour.Zostera or 
 Eelgrass grows in the warm shallow    
 water and provides food for           
 innumerable invertebrates which in    
 turn feed on birds and fish.These     
 undisturbed shallow waters and        
 mudflats are very important feeding   
 grounds for both resident waders and  
 winter migrants.Despite the RSPB bird 
 reserve ,nearby wildfowling is a      
 traditional sport of the area.        
   Along the North-West coast of Arne  
 is the deeper Wareham channel which   
 has to be dredged regularly to enable 
 small boats and cruisers to reach     
 Wareham_the head of navigation in     
 Roman times.Cormorant,Heron,Mallard,  
 Shelduck,Oystercatcher,Curlew,Redshank
 Great black-backed gull are common    
 species to be found here.             </content>
