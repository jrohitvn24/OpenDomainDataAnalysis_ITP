  The Sainsbury's on the 6 acre site at
 Bath was completed in November 1983 it
 took just over a year to build and on 
 buying the land had to renovate Green 
 Park Station. The main building covers
 26,000 sq.ft. sales area and 20,000   
 sq.ft. storage area.                  
  Sainsbury's employs 350 to 400       
 people, mostly part time. More staff  
 are employed at christmas and easter. 
  The large car park provides a vital  
 service for customers and city centre 
 workers. It holds 242 cars. On a good 
 day it is full from 9am to 9pm. The   
 small car park holds 190 cars and is  
 only full on Thurs.Fri. and Sat.
