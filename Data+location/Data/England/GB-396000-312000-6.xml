		<content>Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence have owned the   
local shop which is also a post office 
for seven years . Before that they had 
a mobile shop. They enjoy working in   
the shop but say that it is difficult  
to have a holiday together and they    
have to work very long hours. If one   
of  them is ill it can make things     
very difficult .   As well as selling  
stamps, the post office pays Child     
Benefit and Pensions, sells National   
Savings Certificates,Gift Tokens and   
Premium Bonds,performs Girobank and    
National Savings Bank transactions,    
accepts payments for Telephone Bills   
and Water Rates. Mr Lawrence looks     
after the post office and Mrs Lawrence 
looks after the shop which sells       
sweets,cakes,groceries and is also an  
off-lience selling beer, wine and      
spirits . The shop has been there for  
60 years, it has 200 customers a day.  </content>
