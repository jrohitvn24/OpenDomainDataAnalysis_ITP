 all over Cotgrave to go to a          
 selection of activities such as       
 discos,summer schools,wedding         
 receptions and break-dancing.There is 
 a snack bar and a snooker table.The   
  tennis courts are owned by the youth 
 club.There are three discos every week
 one for under 15's and two for the    
 over 15's.At the summer school,you can
 do lots of things such as puppet      
 making,kite making,swimming,listen to 
 stories and visits to places.Last year

 Derbyshire.Near the end of the summer 
 school,we have a Sports Day.
