		<content> Marston Magna has disadvantages for   
 old and young.There are no youth clubs
 except the church choir which meets on
 a Friday night for practices,a Sunday 
 school or a recently built recreation 
 ground.There used to be a village     
 youth club but gradually fewer and    
 fewer people came so the club stopped.
 Now people go to Rimpton youth club.  
 As there is no school, childrens'     
 parents have to pay for them to be    
 taken to school in a bus to Queen     
 Camel, a distance of about two miles  
 or they have to take them by car. For 
 older children the nearest school is  
 at Castle Cary which is a distance of 
 eight miles.                          
 A disadvantage for old people is that 
 there are no shops in the village.Only
 bread,milk and papers are delivered if
 ordered.Most people go to Yeovil for  
 their shopping.                       </content>
