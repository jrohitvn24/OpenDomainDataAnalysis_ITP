		<title>01Hawkinge Village and Area</title>
		<content> The village of Hawkinge lies on top of
 the North Downs 4 miles north of      
 Folkestone and 7 miles west of Dover. 
 The village was previously known as   
 Uphill and is still shown as such on  
 the O.S.maps.Apart from the village   
 the block is completely rural. Most of
 the land is given over to agricultural
 use but, because it is so hilly, some 
 land is used as rough pasture. The    
 landscape is picturesque with sharp   
 hills and sudden deep valleys         
 constantly recurring.                 
    The village has a population of    
 approximately 1000.The houses are a   
 mixture of modern two storey buildings
 (detached,semi-detached and terrace)  
 and bungalows.there are few ancient   
 buildings.There is a mixture of       
 private and council housing.There is a
 small shopping area in the middle of  
 the village.                          </content>
