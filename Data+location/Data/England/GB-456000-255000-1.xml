		<content> This unknown part of England is       
 chiefly noted for its pleasant rollig 
 countryside and attractive villages.  
 Everdon is such a village, named as   
 such from the time when wild boars    
 roamed the hillsides around here.  In 
 the valley, the land is used for      
 growing crops such as wheat, barley   
 and oil-seed rape, while on the higher
 land sheep are grazed.  Surrounding   
 the village are a number of stables   
 where horses are trained for          
 steeple-chasing.  The old school has  
 been turned into a much used county   
 field centre.  Many of the people     
 living in this area have jobs         
 elsewhere and use their cottages at   
 weekends only, although others use    
 Everdon as a dormatory village.  As   
 settlement is so sparse there is      
 little objection to Motor cycle       
 Scrmbling taking place on sundays,    </content>
