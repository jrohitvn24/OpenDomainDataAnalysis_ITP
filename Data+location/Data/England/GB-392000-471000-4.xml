		<content>   The main part of the school was     
 built in 1876, but since then a dining
 room, kitchen and toilets have been   
 added.  There is a small playground at
 the school front, and a field at      
 the back which, in spring, is partly  
 covered with Snowdrops and Speedwell. 
 The school's water supply comes from  
 the nearby hill, and sewage goes to a 
 septic tank in the field.             
   The school takes primary age        
 children from the whole dale.  They   
 start as rising-five year olds, and   
 stay till they are aged eleven.  In   
 summer 1985 there were 17 children on 
 roll, with one full-time teacher (the 
 headteacher) and a part-time teacher. 
 In their last year children take part 
 in the a selection scheme, which      
 determines whether they go to         
 Secondary School in Grassington, or   
 Grammar Schools in Skipton.           </content>
