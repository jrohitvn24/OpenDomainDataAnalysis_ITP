		<title>08Horton Hall - Manor house.</title>
		<content> Horton Hall is an old building,built  
 150 years ago.It has been owned by a  
 school,hospital,families and a person 
 called Violet Needham.In the Second   
 World War Messerschmitt 109's shot    
 down a Whitney bomber which just      
 missed crashing into the Hall.The     
 house which is an early Victorian     
 design was probably built for a rich  
 man.The estate agents in 1885 said it 
 had 1500 acres but now it only has a  
 few acres.The Hall is now owned by    
 PAFEC,a company which makes computer  
 programmes for testing structures on  
 buildings.The company employ a small  
 number of people,all from outside the 
 area,apart from the managing director 
 who lives there.The Hall is made of   
 Bath stone and blends in well with the
 surrounding area.Much of it has been  
 rebuilt recently as the stonework has 
 been crumbling.                       </content>
