		<content> The first thing that is a necessitity 
 living in a small village is a car,   
 especially if you have children       
 otherwise getting them to schools at a
 distance could be a problem with the  
 children going to a wide range of     
 schools in the area. There are many   
 things in this day and age to help the
 busy housewife get through the day,   
 here are some of them; Automatic      
 Washing Machines, tumble Dryer, Vacuum
 Cleaner and Freezer. More familes are 
 getting Dishwashers, Microwave Cookers
 and Electric Coffee Makers which keeps
 coffee brewing all day if you want.   
 With there being only one shop in this
 village Bulk Buying of meat, bread and
 vegetables for the freezer makes life 
 a lot easier, although nearly everyone
 grows some vegetables and salads.     
 Every family has a television set and 
 some have 2.                          </content>
