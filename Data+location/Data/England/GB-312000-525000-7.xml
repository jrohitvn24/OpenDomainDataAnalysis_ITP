		<title>07Communications in Lorton</title>
		<content> Letters are collected and delivered   
 daily by van from Cockermouth. There  
 is a sub-post office in the shop in   
 High Lorton. Anxiety is felt for its  
 future. The present owner wishes to   
 retire and no one has been able to    
 take over. The public telephone kiosk 
 is not at present under threat of     
 closure though most people have       
 telephones. A Cockermouth newsagent   
 brings daily papers to the High Lorton
 Shop by 9 a.m. They are called for.   
 The Low Lorton shop provides a similar
 service for Sunday papers. The popular
 weekly local papers are Times &amp; Star, 
 Cumberland News and Keswick Reminder. 
 The Parish Magazine published monthly 
 by the Parochial Church Council       
 reports all village activities in     
 addition to its coverage of church    
 news. All television channels are     
 received - radio reception is good.   </content>
