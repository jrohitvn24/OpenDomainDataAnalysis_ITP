		<title>03Types of housing.</title>
		<content> The{High Green}area has many types of 
 housing from the{old village}to the   
{new housing estate.}Opinions differ as
 to which is the best form of housing. 
{"Dirty, dark and cramped",}was one    
 child's opinion of many of the old    
 village cottages. But asking older    
 people who lived in them got a        
 different view.{"Cosy and full of     
{character",}said one man. The very    
 fact that they were old was an        
 advantage to many.{"The new houses are
{all the same." "Just boxes!"          
 But one boy said, "At least we've got 
 central heating and an inside toilet."
 When considering{The Fosters,}the     
 single tower block, opinions were even
 more divided.{"A dump. They should    
{knock it down!",}said one resident.   
 "But where else can you get such a    
 great view?", replied another.
