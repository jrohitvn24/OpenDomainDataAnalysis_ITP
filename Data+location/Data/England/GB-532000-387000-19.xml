		<title>19Louth Bypass</title>
		<content> In 1955 Louth area Council decided to 
 improve the A16 which runs through the
 centre of Louth.This idea of widening 
 and straightening the A16 failed to   
 mature as it meant damaging listed    
 buildings in the town.So in 1960 a    
 bypass was suggested to take away most
 of the heavy traffic.By 1977 8 routes 
 were being considered.In 1980 all of  
 these were shelved due to lack of     
 funds.In 1982 public pressure caused  
 the plans to be reconsidered.The      
 present plan is to begin construction 
 in 1988 and for completion by 1990.Our
 poll showed the majority thought that 
 there was too much traffic in the     
 narrow streets,damaging buildings and 
 making them unsafe.70% of the people  
 agreed that the proposed route,which  
 joins the A16 just north of Louth,    
 bypassing to the west and rejoining   
 the A16 at Kenwick Bar, was best.     </content>
