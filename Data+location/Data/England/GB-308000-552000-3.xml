		<title>03Housing _ Silloth</title>
		<content> Silloth town was built to  a  gridiron
 plan designed by architects  J.W. &amp; J.
 Hay of Liverpool.{ The Green}separates
 the  shore {Promenade }from the  town,
 which  is  based  on  3  main  streets
 parallel  to  the  shore: {Criffel}St.
{Solway}St. and {Skiddaw}St.  The other
 streets are at right-angles  and named
 after local rivers e.g.{Esk, Petteril,
{Eden, Wampool, Waver, Caldew.}Most are
 wide  and  tree-lined,  and  some  are
 cobbled with granite setts.           
 In Silloth town itself  there are  two
 garages, 5 Churches, 5 licensed clubs,
 5 hotels and pubs and 304 houses, some
 combined with the 35 shops. The houses
 are  all ages, some  back-to-back, but
 most  with  high - walled  yards.  The
 houses in the  main  streets are built
 in  classical style  and are mainly  3
 stories  high.  A  small  new  council
 estate was built in 1979.             </content>
