		<title>19My Favourite Computer Game</title>
		<content> My favourite game is Blockbuster. It  
 is an exciting game with a lot of     
 different screens. There is Buster,   
 the rabbit, who has to jump on all of 
 the squares to change the colour.     
 There is a fox who tries to stop      
 Buster from jumping on all the squares
 and there is a monkey who jumps all   
 the way down the screen leaving a     
 trail of footprints. You then have to 
 jump on the footprints to clear the   
 screen. After 4 different screens you 
 have to jump twice on each square to  
 change the colour twice. There is now 
 a squirrel who jumps on the squares   
 and changes them back to their        
 original colour. So it gets more      
 hectic as you go along.
