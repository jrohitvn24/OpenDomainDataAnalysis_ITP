		<content>   The present primary school is housed
 in three buildings on two sites. A 112
 year old school is separated from two 
 new buildings by the main road.In 1963
 a new school was built for the upper  
 juniors and infants to use and later  
 in 1971 an infant school was completed
 There are 18 classes with approximate-
 ly 30 children in each making a some  
 540 children in all.                  
   The 1873 school was built in three  
 separate parts,for infants,boys and   
 girls.The boys were separated from the
 girls by a fence and if they were     
 caught passing notes or climbing over 
 it they were severely punished. Even  
 now some rooms can only be reached    
 from others by going outside.         
   There are some roads  named after   
 previous headmasters and mistresses,  
 such as Pope Drive,Reeves Close,Oliver
 Road and Gibbon Rise.                 </content>
