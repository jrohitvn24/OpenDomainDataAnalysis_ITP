		<content>      The landscape is undulating and a
 chequerboard of hedged fields,        
 averaging l87m. to the west &amp; falling 
 to 6lm. along the meandering valley of
 the Gamber brook, flowing NE/SW.  The 
 land rises again to l07m. to the NE.  
      The soils are predominantly clays
 from the Old Red Sandstone, plus      
 lighter sands and valley alluvium -   
 providing lst-class farmland and      
 worked for mixed farming and fruit.   
      Patches of mixed woodland have   
 been retained but larger areas, such  
 as Scudamore Wood have been gradually 
 felled since the war.                 
      Many farms and houses are        
 stone-built and 200-300 years old,    
 some with fine stone barns. Some  are 
 l6th century (Llanwarne Court: Hills  
 Farm: Manor House, Pencoyd: and       
 Trebaron).  Record of a dwelling      
 on this last site occurs for 923 A.D. </content>
