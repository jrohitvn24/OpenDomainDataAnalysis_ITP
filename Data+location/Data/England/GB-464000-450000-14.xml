		<content> I get up at 08.00. Breakfast is ready.
 I eat cornflakes and drink orange     
 squash. I put on my coat and shoes,   
 get my bag,say goodbye to Mum and walk
 to school. I meet my friends in the   
 playground.The bell goes, we all rush 
 in noisily.I go to the classroom, get 
 my school work out.Mrs Copley counts  
 the names of people staying for a     
 cooked dinner. I take it to the school
 secretary. Then we may line up for an 
 assembly or may get on with our       
 work.At 10.30 the bell goes for break.
 I play football for 20 mins.Then we go
 in for maths. Soon it is over. I eat a
 cooked meal in the school hall, self- 
 service, then I go to play.At 13.05 it
 is time for science. We look for mini 
 beasts. It is time for games. We are  
 playing football. Then it is home     
 time. I walk home, watch T.V. for     
 hours and go to bed.                  </content>
