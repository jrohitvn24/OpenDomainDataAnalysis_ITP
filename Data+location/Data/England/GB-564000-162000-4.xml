		<content> There are two types of managed        
 woodland in the area.  The largest is 
 coppicing, mainly sweet chestnut for  
 palings, fence posts and logs.  Each  
 year one tenth of an estate is cut and
 left to regrow.  Oak and ash standards
 are left to mark areas.  In the N.E.  
 corner is a Forestry Commission area  
 under conifers, grown for building.   
 Most farm woodland and a lot of       
 coppiced land is let to private shoots
 and these are managed to facilitate   
 the breeding of pheasants.  The farm  
 woodlands consist of magnificient     
 beeches, oaks, yew, wild cherry and   
 silver birch.  There are also typical 
 chalk-loving trees, such as spindle,  
 wayfarers tree, alder and spurging    
 blackthorn.
