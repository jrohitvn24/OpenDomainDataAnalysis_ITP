		<title>17ROADS / ST EVAL AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> The roads stay the same,but lines now 
 stop and telegraph poles begin to     
 appear.There is barbed wire on one    
 side of the road on top of the hedge. 
 This is to keep the animals from going
 onto the road. The roads now get a    
 little wider and there are a few      
 bridges.The yellow lines appear again 
 and you pass more houses.A few bits of
 pavement appear.The road leads into   
 St Mawgan.{ST EVAL AIR FIELD}was used 
 in World War 2 for refueling,landing  
 and taking off.The planes were        
 Spitfires,Sunderlands,Bothas,         
 Wellingtons,Mosqitoes and Gnats.      
 Occasionally a Beaufort would take off
 from the airfield.A headquarters is   
 still standing and it is used as an   
 R.A.F. training unit.The Airfield is  
 used for motorbike and car racing.You 
 can tell this by the shattered glass. 
 There are a few electricity pylons.   </content>
