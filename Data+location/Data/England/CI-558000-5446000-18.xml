		<title>18CHILDREN AND T.V.</title>
		<content>  We did a survey of children's T.V.   
 viewing habits. We asked the 30 pupils
 in our class to record what programmes
 they watched during one week in       
 January 1985. The least amount of time
 spent in front of the 'tele' was 5 hrs
 30 mins. The most was 24 hrs! We      
 worked out the average to be about 11 
 hrs. per week. The most popular       
 programmes were drama series followed 
 by the 'soap operas'. Every one had a 
 colour T.V. at home, and half of the  
 class had a set in their own bedroom. 
 27 out of the 30 had a video recorder 
 and 14 had a micro computer in the    
 house. Every household had a car, and 
 just over half of them had 2 or more  
 cars. One boy had 8 T.V.s, 5 cars, a  
 caravan and 2 speedboats!             
 When we asked about watching T.V. in  
 the summer everyone said that they    
 spent far more time on the beach now! </content>
