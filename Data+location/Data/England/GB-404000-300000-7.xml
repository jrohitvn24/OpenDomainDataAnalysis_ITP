		<title>07 Fircroft, Aldridge</title>
		<content> This is an example of building        
 techniques in the mid 1980's. Fircroft
 is a building site of 6.5 acres       
 situated at the north of Aldridge near
 Walsall. Four different kinds of      
 Houses are to be built on Fircroft.   
 The Merlin and Albany are 3 bedroomed 
 houses and the Viscount and Kestrel   
 are 4 bedroomed houses. 64 houses are 
 to be built on the site. The prices   
 range from Â£35,500 for the Merlin to  
 Â£51,500 for the Viscount. Although all
 the houses will have fairly large     
 front and back gardens many people    
 have the opinion that all the rooms in
 the houses are very small considering 
 their price, for example one bedroom  
 in the Viscount had just enough room  
 for a bed and a wardrobe. We all      
 agreed that the houses are not very   
 good value for money considering other
 houses built in the 1980's.           </content>
