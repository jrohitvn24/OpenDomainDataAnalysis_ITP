		<title>09NEWTON VILLAGE MEETING.</title>
		<content> Too small for a parish council,we have
 a Village Meeting formed in 1983 and  
 with a chairman who attends County    
 Council meetings in a non-voting      
 capacity.All villagers are eligible to
 attend but the older residents are    
 reluctant to do so without a great    
 deal of persuasion.All opinions are   
 canvassed and put to the meeting and  
 it is often the views of the older    
 residents which direct our decisions. 
 The Meeting maintains dialoque with   
 the estate to monitor or discuss any  
 changes or any common problems.It     
 deals with District Council proposals 
 and directives.It organises fund-     
 raising activities and the various    
 rotas which operate to maintain the   
 village as the inhabitants wish it to 
 be.
