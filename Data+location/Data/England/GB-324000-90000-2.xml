    In{Axmouth}there are very few      
 amenities. There is a village Post    
 Office store, the shop sells mainly   
 household things. Sometimes it can be 
 a bit of a problem if a person wants  
 to go to Seaton, as in Axmouth they   
 don't sell any clothes, shoes etc. But
 transport is a problem. There is only 
 one Axe Valley mini travel service so 
 if a person missed that bus they would
 have to walk unless they got a lift   
 . The people of Axmouth rely on       
 holiday traffic to improve their trade
 as there are two Pubs and Restaurants 
 in Axmouth.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
