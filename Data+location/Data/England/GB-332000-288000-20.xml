		<title>20BISHOPS CASTLE RAILWAY</title>
		<content>  The railway was opened in 1861.      
 It was intended to link the town with 
 the outside world by connecting with  
 the Oswestry and Newtown Railway at   
 Montgomery and with the Shrewsbury and
 Hereford Railway at Wistanstow.       
                                       
   There was some local opposition and 
 a lack of money,which dogged the line 
 all its life.                         
                                       
   The line to Montgomery was never    
 built and the company struggled along 
 always near bankruptcy until 1937 when
 the last train to Craven Arms ran.    
                                       
   The line was taken up, the rolling  
 stock sold or broken up, and all that 
 remains are some bits of the platform 
 and station buildings.                
     The Railway Boom had passed       
 Bishops Castle by.                    </content>
