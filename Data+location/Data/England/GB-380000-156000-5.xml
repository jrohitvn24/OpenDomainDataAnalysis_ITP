		<title>05RIVER FROME &amp; POMEROY WOODS</title>
		<content> At the end of{POMEROY LANE}is the     
{River Frome.}It's a lovely safe place 
 to go paddling or fishing on a warm   
 afternoon . We usually cycle. It's a  
 clear shallow river that moves quickly
 over the pebbly bottom. People fly    
 fish and it is private. If you go up  
 the river furtherthere is an old water
 wheel. It goes round very slowly. You 
 can also canoe.                       
 In {POMEROY WOODS}people go shooting. 
 They shoot specially reared pheasants 
 besides rabbits and foxes. If you're  
 lucky you may see a deer. There are   
 also grey squirrels and woodpeckers.  
 The ground is hard in Summer but boggy
 in Winter. There are lots of oaks,    
 firs,horse chestnuts , ash and a few  
 elm. So in Autumn you have a lot of   
 leaves under your feet. You can walk  
 through the wood because there is a   
 public footpath.                      </content>
