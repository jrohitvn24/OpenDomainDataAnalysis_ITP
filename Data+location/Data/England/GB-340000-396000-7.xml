		<content> My name is Keith and I live in a      
 terraced house. We have 3 bedrooms but
 we do not have a garage. There are no 
 post boxes or telephones in our street
 and outside our house there is a big  
 field immediately in front. Further   
 away are more terraced houses and also
 at the back.                          
 Inside our house we have a gas fire   
 and a gas cooker. The house was built 
 in 1967 and is now 18 years old. My   
 mum and dad moved to it because work  
 was near.                             
 My name is Claire and I live in a low 
 rise flat. The building has 3 floors. 
 I live in the middle one. Our flat has
 3 bedrooms but the bottom floor flats 
 have only 2. I like living in a flat  
 but I hate walking up the stairs all  
 the time.
