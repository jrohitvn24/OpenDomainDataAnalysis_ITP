		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> A day at{Hurn Court School}starts like
 this.  The lights are switched on at{7
{o'clock,}you have half an hour to get 
 washed and dressed and to make your   
 bed.  There are six dormitories where 
 we sleep, three of the dormitories    
 leave at one time the other three     
 later.  As soon as we get to the      
 school dining hall we have breakfast. 
                                       
 At{8.45}the different forms go to     
 their rooms for registration and at{9 
{o'clock}we go to assembly.  After that
 we go to lessons, there are nine      
 lessons in a day finishing at{5       
{o'clock. }Soon after the end of school
 we go to tea.  At{7.30}we go back to  
 where we sleep and that's a day in my 
 life.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
