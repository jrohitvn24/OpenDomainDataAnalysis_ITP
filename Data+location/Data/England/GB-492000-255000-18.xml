 Lavendon is a very noisy village      
 because of the busy Northampton Road. 
 This is a very dangerous, twisty road 
 and there have been several crashes   
 recently..                            
 There is a Post-Office and general    
 shop, a Village Hall, two pubs and a  
 church. We have a school, but it is   
 not very large.                       
 In the village we have clubs for      
 football and cricket, with six snooker
 tables at the Youth Club. This also   
 has table tennis and a pool table.    
 The village won an award for The      
 Best-Kept Village recently and we all 
 try to keep it tidy.
