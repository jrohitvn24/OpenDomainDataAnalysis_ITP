		<content>    Within the area are the Parishes of
 Charlton and Lea and Cleverton, which 
 includes the village of Garsdon.      
    Farming is very important, even    
 though most people are employed in    
 local towns and cities. Some families 
 have lived in the same home for       
 generations, usually working the land,
 but many have moved here from distant 
 towns and cities to this pretty and   
 peaceful part of the country. Employ- 
 ment has often dictated these moves   
 but no one seems to have any regrets. 
    The housing varies greatly.        
 Cotswold stone farmhouses any many    
 cottages mingle with relatively new   
 homes.                                
    School, Churches and Village Hall  
 are focal points for activities and   
 the residents have a lot enjoyment    
 organising various events. The main   
 land cover is enclosed rough grazing. </content>
