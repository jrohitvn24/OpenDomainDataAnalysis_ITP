		<title>14Changes in the Area</title>
		<content>Mr Ashton has lived in the area all his
life. He is now a parent of two boys   
who attend the Primary School. He      
himself attended the school which now  
houses Lamb's Garage Showroom. He has  
seen the residential development of the
village for which he is grateful, for  
he believes that the arrival of new    
people and their ideas into the area is
good for the village as a whole.       
Mr Ashton can remember how during and  
immediately after the Second World War 
the fields were put under the plough so
that more food could be grown during   
those times of shortage. Now the land  
is used for grazing and some has been  
lost to housing.                       
Mr Ashton believes that the school     
curriculum is much more exciting now   
than it was in his day. There are more 
resources and facilities available. He 
thinks "Domesday Project" is terrific! </content>
