		<content> There are two houses of particular    
 interest. Both once belonged to the   
 Framfield Estate. They are now        
 privately owned. The old estate       
 laundry is now a private home from    
 which the owners run a video business.
 The cottage is surrounded by trees and
 is far from the road. This gives a    
 peaceful environment which the owners 
 think is ideal for their work. The    
 cottage still has glass tiles in the  
 roof where it was  once used as drying
 rooms. What is now a display area was 
 once the dirty linen delivery hatch.  
 Larch Spinney comprises two converted 
 cottages where the Masters of the     
 Hounds once lived.The old kennels are 
 now a garage. The cottage has been    
 greatly extended and is named after   
 the spinney of which only one tree    
 remains.A 100 foot well is in the     
 grounds plus a modern swimming pool.  </content>
