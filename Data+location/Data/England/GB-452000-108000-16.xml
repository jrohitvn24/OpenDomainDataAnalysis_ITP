 not very many letters against dogs.   
 Only a few people write about nuclear 
 war as most people do not know much   
 about it.  The main office is at 43   
 Botley Road, Park Gate, Southampton.

  About one third of the people in our 
 D Block go to Church, and they go to  
 Botley, Curdridge or Wickham Church,  
 depending on which is nearest.        
    The other people go to to the      
 main Church festivals.  All the nearby
 churches are Church of England but    
 there is a Methodist Church near      
 Botley.  Most young are baptised and  
 confirmed in their local church but   
 there are not as many church marriages</content>
