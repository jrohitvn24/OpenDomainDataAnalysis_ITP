<title>21My family life in 2011.</title>
<content>

I wrote this article and can remember a lot about doing the research, I recently found a school book with my Domesday work in it. I am still living in Partridge Green but have my own family now, I got married in 1999 and have a 9 year old son and 5 year old daughter who both attend the local primary school as I did. We live in a house which was not even built when we carried out the project. My parents still live in the same house.   &lt;br />
