		<title>01Wheeldale Plantation Area</title>
		<content> the block s a flattish bleak open aea 
 of heather moorland. It is bisected by
 the stream. Wheeldale Gill, which     
 forms a fairly steep sided valley     
 below the general level of moorland   
 The valley has remnants of the        
 deciduous woodland along the bottom   
 ad side streams. To the north of the  
 stream is a large area of conifer     
 plantation. Sheep graze parts of the  
 moorland and valley but there are no  
 fenced enclosures. Grouse shooting    
 takes place on the moors. Public      
 access is very limited and there are  
 no rights of way to this relatively   
 remote area except long  small public 
 road. However this road  is quite     
 popular with drivers and day trippers 
 and the block can be reached on foot  
 from the Goathland area so tourists do
 come to enjoy the scenery.
