		<content> Rufford Colliery uses computers for   
 control schemes and environmental     
 monitoring.For maximum efficiency and 
 safety,transducers are fitted to      
 conveyors to monitor conditions which 
 are displayed on a V.D.U.If a fault is
 located,the operator can take early   
 action so that coal production is     
 disturbed as little as possible.Trans-
 ducers analyse gases,the signals being
 transmitted via data lines to surface 
 computers.The computers handle control
 of fans,pumps and methane extraction  
 plant underground.The computers and   
 software are made to the colliery's   
 specification.The system runs with a  
 master and slave set up so that any   
 computer can run the whole scheme if  
 necessary.Access to information and   
 control is obtained by the control    
 room operator keying in requirements.
