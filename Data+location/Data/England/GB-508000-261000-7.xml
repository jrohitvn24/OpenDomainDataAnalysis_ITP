		<content> In this block there are{two Public    
{Houses,}the "Crown" in Little         
 Staughton and the "White Horse" in    
 Keysoe. The former is a modern        
 building which replaces the one       
 destroyed by fire. Two other ancient  
 inns of the village were destroyed    
 during World War 2 to make way for the
 airfield. The " White Horse" is an    
 early 15th century inn of great       
 character. Both are popular meeting   
 places with traditional games of      
 dominoes, darts and skittles. Both    
 serve a range of hot and cold bar food
 which is increasingly popular costing 
 around two pounds. Beer is 78p. a     
 pint. Lager, wines and spirits are    
 widely sold. The "Crown" also has a   
 restaurant and the "White Horse" an   
 attractive garden in which drinks and 
 meals are served in the Summer.
