		<title>08SUE RYDER HOME, WHITWELL</title>
		<content> There has been a house on the site of 
 Stagenhoe Park since Domesday times.  
 The present house is an 18th century  
 building with some additions and in   
 recent times has served as a maternity
 hospital and a prep school for boys.  
 In 1969 Lady Ryder bought the house   
 and 9 acres of land as a holiday home 
 for Polish ex-prisoners of war but it 
 is now a nursing home for severely    
 disabled people.There are 40 patients_
 suffering from Parkinson's Disease,   
 Multiple Sclerosis,stroke victims and 
 14 people have Huntingdon's Chorea.   
 Stagenhoe is the only home to accept  
 sufferers from Huntingdon's Chorea and
 an extension is planned for this year 
 to house 15 more patients.The disease 
 is hereditary and has no cure.In spite
 of the patients' severe disabilities  
 Stagenhoe is a very happy place.
