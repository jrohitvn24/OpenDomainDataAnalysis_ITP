		<content> Churches and places of worship in this
 area are many and varied and over the 
 long years have provided opportunity  
 for the population to follow their own
 religion.The three main churches      
 within the area are Church of England 
 known as 'High Church'.A few of the   
 churches date back to history of long 
 ago,Whitwell and St. Lawrence Parish  
 Churches dating from the 12th century,
 but generally as in other parts of the
 Island there was a great upsurge in   
 the Victorian period to cater for the 
 growing population and indeed the     
 large congregation at that time.In    
 this small area each building has a   
 fascinating story to tell and much    
 research and discovery is taking place
 and revealing stories of great        
 interest and indeed the personalities 
 that helped to make the History of the
 community in which they lived.        </content>
