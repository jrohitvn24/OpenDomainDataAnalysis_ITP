		<content> Open farmland rising from salt marshes
 to about 150 feet.  Barley, sugar     
 beet, horticultural crops in huge     
 fields, some grazing of cattle and    
 sheep.  Limitless skyscapes over farms
 and sea.  Flint houses, red pantiled  
 roofs and white paint, sailing        
 birdwatching; much visited in summer, 
 deserted save for residents in winter.
  Farmers and farmworkers, fishermen,  
 shopkeepers, ferrymem, ships handlers,
 retired residents, some employed in   
 precision engineering and some        
 commuting to nearby towns and those   
 employed in the tourist trade.  The   
 villages dominated by their large     
 medieval churches.  The marshes liable
 to flood at spring tides, nature      
 reserves for plants and birds largely 
 owned by the National trust.
