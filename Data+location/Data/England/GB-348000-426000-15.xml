		<content>We went round a lot of houses and saw  
that most of them were semi-detached.  
Most people had gas central heating.   
Double glazing was very popular and    
most people thought it was worth the   
money.                                 
Most people thought it was very        
difficult for young couples having a   
mortgage.                              
There were no high rised flats and     
nearly every one said they were a bad  
idea.                                  
Nearly every house in the D-block has  
a garden and a garage.A lot of people  
just used the garage for storing tools.
There is no new housing being          
constructed in the D-block.
