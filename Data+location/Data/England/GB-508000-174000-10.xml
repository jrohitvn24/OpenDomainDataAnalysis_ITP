		<content> the creche.  One is a mother, who has 
 worked as a helper for two years. The 
 creche is run every day from 9:30 to  
 12:30 and there are thirty children on
 the register. The day we visited the  
 creche to interview the helpers,      
 parents and children, they were having
 a Fancy Dress Competition. Usually the
 children play in the sand-pit, with   
 toys and do painting. While the       
 children are in the creche, their     
 mothers know that they are safe and   
 they can do some kind of sport or     
 continue their education. The school  
 also runs a playgroup. In the         
 playgroup there are 25 children whose 
 mothers pay for each session. During  
 the morning, the children are provided
 with a small bottle of milk and a     
 biscuit and always have a story before
 they go home. The staff and parents   
 raise money through raffles and fetes </content>
