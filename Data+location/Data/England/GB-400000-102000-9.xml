		<content>{THE DEACONESS AT WORK                 
 Deaconess Ann Barber has worked in St.
 James' church, Holt for two years.    
 Before she became Deaconess she worked
 as a parish worker in Wimborne and    
 assisted in services at Wimborne      
 Minster.                              
{SUNDAY SERVICES                       
 The Deaconess takes three services    
 every Sunday, but few people attend   
 them. Holt Parish Church (St.James's) 
 has no sunday school and only four    
 choir boys. More people attend the    
 services on special days such as      
 Christmas and Easter.                 
{CHURCH VISITORS                       
 Most people who visit the church live 
 in or near Holt, but a few people come
 from other parts of the country, or   
 even abroad. Many people who visit the
 church come from the craft centre     
 nearby.                               </content>
