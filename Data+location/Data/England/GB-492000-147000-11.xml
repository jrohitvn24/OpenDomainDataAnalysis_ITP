		<title>11COMPTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church of{St.Nicholas at Compton  
 is over 1000 years old. The tower,    
 nave and part of the chancel were     
 built by the{Saxons}before the Norman 
 conquest, as was the small square     
 window probably belonging to a        
 hermit's cell.The{Normans}raised the  
 height of the walls with pillars and  
 arches and built a vaulted roof to the
 Sanctuary.                            
 The upper Sanctuary is the only one in
 England and has wooden rails over 800 
 years old.The East window has 12th    
 century stained glass showing Mary and
 Jesus.There are murals in a step      
 pattern and on the chancel arch is a  
 graffiti picture of a Knight believed 
 to be a Crusader in the 12th century. 
 The church has a spire.  On the       
 south wall is a scratch dial where    
 shadows from a wooden peg showed the  
 times for services.                   </content>
