		<content>{PLEASE MR. CROCODILE}We sing a song to
 this game like this.                  
 "Please Mr. Crocodile may I cross the 
 water, to see the queen's daughter."  
 "Yes, only if you are wearing...." If 
 you are wearing the colour that the   
 'crocodile' says you can go past him. 
 If not, then you have to get past him 
 without being caught, or you are 'he'.
{STICK IN THE MUD}this is a game of    
 chase where if you are caught you are 
 stuck and can only be freed by someone
 else touching you. When you are caught
 4 times you are then 'he'.            
{HOPSCOTCH} is numbered squares in the 
 playground. One person throws a stone 
 on number 1 and then hops on all the  
 other numbers except 1, picking the   
 stone on the return journey. You then 
 throw on to the next number and so on 
 until you miss a number and then it is
 someone elses turn.                   </content>
