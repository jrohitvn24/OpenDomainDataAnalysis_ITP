		<title>19THE M5 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content>  The M5 motorway passes through the   
 eastern section of the block. The M5  
 runs from Ray Hall junction near West 
 Bromwich, to Devon in the south-west  
 of England.                           
  The block contains one junction      
 -number 2- known as Birchley. This    
 junction is used by many local people 
 for private use, but is especially    
 useful for industrial traffic as there
 are links with all the other major    
 motorways of the country.             
  The M5 links with the M6 at Ray Hall 
 junction and therefore provides easy  
 links to all parts of the West        
 Midlands.                             
  Much of the motorway has been        
 constructed as elevated sections and  
 overlooks much of Oldbury.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
