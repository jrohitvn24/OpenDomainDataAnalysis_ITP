		<title>12HOUSES AND BUILDINGS.</title>
		<content>  Around the Thornton area there are   
 lots of old{barns.}Most of these are  
 made of stone,but just a few of       
 them are made of wood or have timber  
 frames.Most of the{houses}in Thornton 
 are old,but some of them are modern.  
 The old houses were built in 1720,but 
 they were rebuilt in the early 19th   
 Century.Around the area there are     
 also lots of{farms,}either in use or  
 abandoned.They are made of stone with 
 timber frames.Next to Hyde Lane Farm  
 there is a sewage building,but is the 
 only one in the area.Places of storage
 are also numerous such as barns or    
 disused cattle sheds.There were also  
 remains of a{Roman Villa,}but they are
 not standing any more because a       
 Farmhouse has been built on the       
 site.All the Farmhouses have thick    
 stone walls.
