		<title>11River Thames at Chertsey</title>
		<content> The Thames is widely used for sporting
 activities. The area around the bridge
 contains camp and caravan sites, a    
 boatyard and many riverside holiday   
 bungalows. There is much fishing,     
 boating and picnicing in the area.    
 There are a lot of pubs near the river
 which attract young people by offering
 discos and music.                     
 Fishing competitions take place       
 regularly , and catches include pike, 
 gudgeon, eels, minnows and even trout.
 The river is traversed by Chertsey    
 Bridge which is 200 years old and to  
 celebrate the bicentenary there was a 
 raft race and firework display        
 recently.                             
 Upstream of the bridge is Chertsey    
 Lock which has recently been renovated
 to include new moorings. Slightly     
 further upstream the river is crossed 
 by the M3 motorway.                   </content>
