		<title>06Houses in Farcet</title>
		<content> We went to{Farcet}and looked at the   
 different kinds of houses. We saw     
 thatched cottages, modern             
 semi-detached houses, some council    
 houses and one or two detached houses.
 Some of the houses were made of brick,
 some of concrete blocks and some of   
 white-washed stone. Most of the bricks
 are the kind made in the brickyards   
 near here. Nearly all the houses had  
 wooden windows and some of the windows
 were very small. The roofs were       
 thatched, or had tiles or slates on   
 them. Most of the houses had gardens  
 and some of them were quite large.    
 Some of the houses had a few steps    
 leading up to the front door.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
