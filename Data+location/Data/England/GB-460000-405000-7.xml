		<content> The Centre was opened in{1974.} The   
 people who use the Centre come from   
 about a twenty mile radius. The       
 activities include swimming, squash,  
 aerobics, badminton and keep-fit.     
 There are different prices for the    
 different activities.                 
                                       
 Upstairs there is a large clubroom,   
 which can be used for meetings.       
 Sometimes it can be used for parties  
 and discos. During the day it is used 
 for badminton, keep-fit and aerobics. 
                                       
 In the swimming changing rooms there  
 is a foot bath, two showers, and some 
 toilets. For mothers with toddlers    
 there is a small play pen. There are  
 two pools - a large one for good      
 swimmers and a small one for          
 beginners.
