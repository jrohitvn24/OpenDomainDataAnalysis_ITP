 In this area there are 7{farms}and 1  
 market garden most of them are arable 
 farms. The smallest is 100 acres the  
 largest is 720 acres. Farmers use     
 large{machines}and so the fields have 
 been made bigger as the hedges have   
 been knocked down. This together      
 with the death of the elms (Dutch elm 
 disease) has made the countryside very
 bare. Most of the farms only employ   
 about 2 workers but the large market  
 garden employs 50. Some of the best   
 soil in England is here but there is  
 not enough rain to water the crops so 
 the farmers build reservoirs and there
 are irrigation pipes coming from the  
 reservoirs to the fields to water the 
 crops. Several farms keep pigs. One   
 farm has a flock of sheep and fattens 
 bullocks.Another farm has a dairy     
 herd.                                 </content>
