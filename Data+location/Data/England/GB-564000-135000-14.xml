		<title>14   Lamberhurst Vineyard</title>
		<content>   {Lamberhurst Vineyard}is one of the 
 largest in the country.               
    About 25 people work there, tending
 the{vines}and making the{grapes}into  
{wine.}After picking, the presses      
 squeeze all the juices from the grapes
 to produce the wine, which is stored  
 in large tanks in the winery. Later on
 the bottling line fills the{bottles}  
 with the different kinds of wine, puts
 on capsules and finally labels. Then  
 the bottles are packed into boxes and 
 sealed. There is a large{cellar}under 
 the winery where the various types of 
 wine are stored.                      
   {Visitors}are welcomed with guided  
 tours and the chance to taste the     
 wines. Lamberhurst wines regularly win
 prizes in national competitions and   
 are on sale both at the vineyard and  
 the village stores.
