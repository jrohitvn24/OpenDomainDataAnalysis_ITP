		<content>    THERE ARE THREE FARMS IN THE       
AREA.BREAN DOWN FARM,BREAN FARM AND    
WARREN FARM.THE LATTER IS ALSO USED FOR
A CARAVAN SITE WHICH STRETCHES FOR     
ABOUT TWO THIRDS KM ADJACENT TO THE    
ROAD.DAIRY FARMING TAKES PLACE AT ALL  
THREE FARMS,THIS IS DUE TO THE ALLIVIAL
SOIL.STOCKS ARE ABOUT 150 TO 200 COWS  
PER FARM,THIS IS DUE TO THE SAND       
INTRUSION INTO THE ALLIVID SOIL AND THE
RISK OF FLOODING FROM THE SEA.BREAN    
FARM IS THE CENTRE FOR SAND YACHTING A 
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SPORT WHICH 
TAKES PLACE ON BREAN FLATS EVERY       
YEAR.BREAN DOWN FARM WAS IN THE        
ORIGINAL DOOMSDAY BOOK AND HAS ALWAYS  
BEEN USED FOR DAIRY FARMING.THE FARM   
WAS VISITED BY SCHOOLCHILDREN FROM THE 
MIDLANDS UP TO 1982 AND A BOOK WAS     
WRITTEN ON THE FARM BY THE HEADMASTER  
OF ONE SCHOOL.
