		<title>09Churches In Sheffield</title>
		<content> In 1881 there were many churches and  
 chapels in{Brightside}but by 1985     
 things have changed. The large{chapel 
 which could hold 600 people on Dearne 
 Street is now a car park. Next door   
 the old{Sunday School}building has    
 recently been converted to a furniture
 warehouse and is reputedly haunted.   
  The{Parish Church}of St. Thomas's    
 Brightside, built in 1854, stands in  
 an overgrown churchyard and is home to
 the Sheffield School of Gymnastics.   
 St. Margaret's{C of E}built during the
 1920's is still used for worship but  
 looks untidy and neglected outside.   
  A{Methodist}Shop and Mission Centre  
 stands on Birdwell Road where Sunday  
 Services and many community activities
 are regularly held. On Wincobank Lane 
 a former chapel has recently been     
 converted into the Madni Masjid       
{Islamic Community Centre.             </content>
