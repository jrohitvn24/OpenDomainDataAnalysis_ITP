		<title>04Thornton Heath's History 1</title>
		<content> The Pond was a natural pond and was   
 dated back before the 13th Century.It 
 was filled in 1953.There are several  
 Public Houses; one is the Wheatsheaf  
 Inn which was built in 1700; another  
 is The Plough and Harrow which stood  
 where the old gallows was.The name    
 Thornton Heath used to be called      
 Gallows Green.                        
                                       
 Colliers Water Lane used to be an     
 important highway and there were      
 several cottages; the largest was     
 called Lilac Cottage which stood      
 between numbers 25 to 31.It was       
 knocked down early in this century.On 
 this road there were lots of coal     
 burners used by the colliers.Some     
 people say that the pond was haunted  
 by a young lady.                      
                                       
 Trumble Gardens is quite recent.Cont.5</content>
