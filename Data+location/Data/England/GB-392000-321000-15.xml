 was found in an ambulance at Stafford 
District General Hospital.The crew     
named him Zebra Five after the call    
sign of their vehicle.He was obviously 
abandoned but is now being well looked 
after.

             G.E.C.Switchgear Ltd. is  
to supply transformers for a new power 
station in India.The order was won     
against fierce  competition from other

also has orders from  the United       
States and Oman,and is completing      
work for Malaya and Bangladesh.
