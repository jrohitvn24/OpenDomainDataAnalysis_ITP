 school was closed. For a while it     
 housed the local Theatre-in-Education 
 group 'Theatrevan'. Later it was used 
 as a Secondary Schools' Tutorial Unit 
 but has now been taken over by a com- 
 puter firm, ITEC.                     
 The two Little Parndon schools were   
 some of the first to be built in the  
 town and are now nearly thirty years  
 old. Photograph D actually shows the  
 Infants School; the Junior School is  
 to the right of the photo. Both       
 schools share the same site, which is 
 almost certainly the best in the new  
 town. The playing fields run into the 
 woods which border the site on its    
 south side, and give it one of the    
 most attractive backgrounds to a      
 school in a largely urban area.
