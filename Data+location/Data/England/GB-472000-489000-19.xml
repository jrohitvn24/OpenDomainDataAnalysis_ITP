		<content> Rev. Francis Hewitt,who lives in      
 Lastingham,is responsible for 4 other 
 parishes and is assisted by a Lay     
 reader &amp; several retired clergy. He is
 also the Rural Dean of Helmsley. Each 
 church has its parochial church       
 council &amp; one or two services are held
 in all churches each Sunday. A recent 
 venture has been combined services for
 all 5 parishes on special church      
 festivals &amp; these have been quite     
 succesful but most prefer their own   
 church services. The introduction of  
 the Alternative Service Book for some 
 services has not yet been fully       
 accepted. After a lapse of many years 
 a choir &amp; sunday school have been     
 re-introduced. Once a fortnight there 
 is a service held in Lastinghams      
 Wesleyan chapel &amp; a similar service is
 held once a week at Cropton.
