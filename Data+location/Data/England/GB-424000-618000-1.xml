		<content> The rocky coastline runs NS, &amp; half of
 this blockis sea.   Craster Village   
 has a population of c.350.   There is 
 a harbour with five fishing boats     
 (called cobles) each manned by two    
 men.   They fish for crabs, lobsters, 
 whitefish, sea-trout and salmon.   A  
 kippering shed operates from June to  
 September smoking herring now bought  
 by lorry from the west coast of       
 Scotland.   The coast is designated as
 "an ara of outstanding natural beauty"
 and visited by many touristes in the  
 summer-mainly on day trips.   A line  
 of westward facing cliffs (called     
 heughs) runs NS 500 metres from the   
 sea.   There is a medieval pele tower 
 in the small hamlet of Dunstan and    
 another at Craster Tower (continuously
 occupied by the family of that name   
 since the 12th century): both lie     
 about one kilometre west of Craster   </content>
