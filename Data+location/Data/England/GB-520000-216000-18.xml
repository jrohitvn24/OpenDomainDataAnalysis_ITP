		<title>18ENTERTAINMENT IN WELWYN</title>
		<content>  Formed in Sept 1974 by Ann Lawson    
 with 17 members of the Wives Organisa-
 tion of St Mary's Church, Welwyn Wives
 Choir is nearly 40 strong, still with 
 several founder members. Now known as 
 the Welwyn Ladies Choir, it has       
 entered, with a great deal of success,
 many local Music Festivals, and has   
 given concerts nearly every year, the 
 proceeds alwys being given to a       
 charity. Over the past few years the  
 Welwyn Husbands and Friends have sung 
 with the Ladies at Christmas concerts 
 and others where male voices are      
 required.                             
  The Welwyn Wailers were formed in    
 1973 as an informal group presenting  
 occasional entertainments of local    
 interest in aid of mainly local       
 charities. A special fund known as    
 the Welwyn Deprived Families Fund was 
 set up in 1975 to help local families.</content>
