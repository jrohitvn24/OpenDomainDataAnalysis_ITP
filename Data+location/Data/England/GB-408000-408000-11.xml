		<title>11Shopping Facilities,Meltham</title>
		<content> Out of forty different people         
 interviewed the majority,that is      
 ninety-three percent resided in       
 Meltham,but thirty-eight citizens     
 shopped in Huddersfield as well.The   
 shopping facilities were found to be  
 adequate for a population of a village
 of this size.The neighbouring town    
 Huddersfield was cheaper than Meltham 
 and contained shops like clothes for  
 the whole family,health foods, toys,  
 records, opticians and amusement      
 centres which Meltham couldn't offer. 
 The village was more convenient       
 though, as Huddersfield is five miles 
 away.Most interviewees shopped every  
 day.The only criticism about Meltham  
 are the closing hours,that they       
 shouldn't shut at dinner times or on  
 Wednesday afternoon and Saturday      
 afternoon.However the facilities are  
 very satisfactory.                    </content>
