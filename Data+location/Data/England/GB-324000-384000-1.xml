		<title>01The area around Irby</title>
		<content>    There are three main areas around  
 Irby; Thurstaston,Greasby and Frankby.
   We have seen a lot of building work 
 going on recently in Greasby and Irby.
 Thurstaston is still a tiny hamlet and
 has changed very little in the last   
 100 years.                            
   Greasby and Irby are mainly         
 dormitory villages for Liverpool.     
 There is a large park called Arrowe   
 Park and a recently built hospital    
 called Arrowe Park Hospital.          
   The area is very pretty and most    
 people enjoy living here.We also have 
 a National Trust wood called Harrock  
 Wood.
