		<title>06HOW A VILLAGE HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content> Mrs. Green has lived in Webheath since
 1950 when the village was smaller.    
 When she was younger there were flower
 shows, youth clubs, a bowling green   
 behind the Village Hall and more      
 shops, including a drapers. Men were  
 farm labourers or worked in the needle
 industries in Redditch. The school was
 housed in the Village Hall and was    
 very small only having 15 children.   
 The children started at 5. When they  
 got to 7 they went to St.Lukes. All   
 the children went home for lunch. They
 had 1 big classroom split into 2.     
 Webheath Primary school was built in  
 1959 on fields belonging to the       
 council.It was for children of 5-11   
 years. It'S called a First school now 
 with children from 5-9 years. The     
 children played with bean bags,quoits 
 ropes or made up their own games from 
 the things they found around them.    </content>
