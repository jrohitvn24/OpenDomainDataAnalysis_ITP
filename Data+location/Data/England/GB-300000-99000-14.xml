		<content> The type of housing you will find in  
 Clyst Hydon is varied. There is cob   
 and thatch (cob) .It is a mixture of  
 mud and straw (dung). To make this you
 mix it up and down to make a wall. You
 then let it dry and you get a hard    
 strong substance called cob.There     
 are brick buildings. Most of them are 
 rendered.There is a Close and a Manor 
 and we found out about it alot.The    
 Manor House was built in 1830 by the  
 Rev. John Huyshe.It was built as a    
 parsonage because the old one was     
 burnt down in 1812.The buildings      
 around the yard. Some of them we think
 are older than these.We  also think   
 the oldest building is the barn.It was
 a barn but it was converted into a    
 stable.There were four boxes.These    
 housed four horses.There is a tack    
 room and a coach house which is now   
 used as a garage.                     </content>
