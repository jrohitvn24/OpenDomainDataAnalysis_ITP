		<content>   In 1984 Betley entered the          
Staffordshire Best Kept Village        
competition for the first time and then
again this year.The competition is run 
by the Community Council of            
Staffordshire annually and judging     
takes place in May.There are 3 classes 
and Betley is in the medium sized      
villages.In 1984 Betley came third.A   
sub-committee of the parish council led
by Rev.H Armstrong,the former vicar,is 
responsible for planning a campaign    
each year to encourage people to keep  
the village clean and tidy.Both years  
they organised a competition for the   
school children to design posters.The  
winning posters were then displayed in 
shops and similar places in the        
village.
