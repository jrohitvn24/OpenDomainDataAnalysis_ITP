		<title>17EMPLOYMENT,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  At the moment unemployment figures   
 are very high.Reasons for this are    
 many and varied,but the overall effect
 has been to decimate a previously     
 labour intensive work force.When      
 school leavers enter this highly      
 competetive job market they find      
 themselves the least knowledgeable,   
 least experienced and hence, least    
 employable of all.                    
  In an area such as Withernsea, the   
 one and only major industry is        
 agriculture and even this is rapidly  
 contracting.As a result many young    
 people leave the area to enter such   
 careers as construction, hairdressing,
 office work,HM forces and engineering.
 Those remaining in the area are       
 resticted to shop work,catering,      
 farming and general labouring, much of
 this being seasonal work.Fewer than   
 20% find full time permanent work.    </content>
