		<title>06Homestead Farm  The Cows</title>
		<content>     Homestead farm is a{dairy}farm    
 with {Guernsey}and{Friesian}cows.They 
 milk just over 100 cows.              
    On average the cows each give 20   
 litres of milk in a day.Just now the  
 cows are being dried off.They have an 
 80 day rest period before they have   
 their next calf.                      
    They freeze brand the cows with a  
 number on their backs. The life of a  
 cow is about 4 years.They have some   
 that are 10 years old.                
    The land is{heavy clay.}The silage 
 feeds the cows through the winter when
 the cows are inside.They also have    
 concentrate which costs Â£150 a ton.   
 Each cow will eat one and a half tons 
 during her 305 milking days.          
    Small farmers can't afford to grow 
 corn.Nearby an arable farmer with 900 
 acres has a lot of machinery but just 
 2 workers.                            </content>
