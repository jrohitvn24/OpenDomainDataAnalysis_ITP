		<title>18ENTERTAINMENT IN HORLEY</title>
		<content> Horley has its own theatre club formed
 July 1952 by Horley Central Players.  
 The Archway Theatre Club was located  
 in the middle railway arch. After a   
 short closure, the theatre was        
 extended to cover three arches. The   
 Barts Players also perform here. Both 
 groups produce up to ten plays each   
 year. The number of performances has  
 grown recently because of a greater   
 demand for tickets and only members of
 the club may purchase tickets for     
 themselves and guests. They have their
 own bar. Productions are sponsored by 
 outside groups. Horley had one cinema 
 "The Regent" until July 1982. It was  
 situated in Victoria Road but was     
 demolished to allow for further       
 development next to Waitrose super    
 market. Once a larger cinema, it had  
 been converted to provide Bingo       
 downstairs and a cinema upstairs.     </content>
