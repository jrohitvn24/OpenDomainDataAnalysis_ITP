		<title>19LANGAR IN THE WAR</title>
		<content> Very few people went to war from      
 Langar because many were farm workers,
 some were cement makers and others    
 worked with the aircraft.All were     
 reserved jobs.                        
       Langar Airfield was first used  
 by the{R.A.F.}who flew{Lancaster      
{bombers}which were counted out and in 
 every raid.They made very dark        
 silhouettes in the sky.Later the      
{Americans}took over and used the      
 airfield for practising gliding and   
 parachuting .They seem to have wrecked
 all the gates in the village with     
 their jeeps.They were followed by the 
{Canadians}who used the hangars for    
 aircraft repairs,before the arrival of
 the German prisoners of war.Some      
 people in Langar still have contact   
 with their prisoners who helped on the
 land.                                 
                                       </content>
