		<content>  Belchamp St. Paul is entirely        
 surrounded by agricultural land of a  
 consistently high quality classified  
 as Grade 2 by the Ministry of         
 Agriculture. Most of the land is under
{arable cultivation,}large fields      
 devoid of tree and hedgerow boundaries
 which give a somewhat stark           
 appearance. The pattern of farming has
 drastically changed over the last 40  
 years. Whereas a 400 acre farm        
 employed 16 men fully, now a mere 2   
 can do all the work. Not only that,   
 they can grow more crops, for instance
 an acre used to yield about 10 sacks  
 of corn now an acre will yield between
 3 and 5 tons. There are only two main 
 crops -{wheat and barley.}The best    
 barley is used for making beer, the   
 wheat is used for biscuits and animal 
 food. There is a{surplus of grain}and 
 some is stored, some sold to Russia.  </content>
