		<title>19In and around Creeting</title>
		<content>  Creeting is an pleasant place to     
drive through, and there are several   
footpaths both through fields and along
the river.  There is also a nature     
reserve called Fen Alder Carr.         
  Buildings worth seeing are Hawks     
Mill, an old water mill, not used any  
more but attractive to look at. The two
churches at Creeting St. Mary and St.  
Peter are worth a visit.The former     
stands in a very commanding position   
above the road. There are some         
interesting old houses at the centre   
of Creeting St. Mary.Two adjoining     
houses, one white and one pink, were   
the King's Head Inn until 1959 and were
originally built as a farmhouse in     
1580. Opposite is a cottage,           
half-flint, originally two labourers'  
cottages, later a forge, then a wheel- 
wright's. Another cottage was lived in 
by a stockman, then was a post office. </content>
