		<title>09          SHOPPING</title>
		<content>      There are no shops in either of  
 the villages of Wighill and Newton    
 Kyme. Our shopping survey of 46       
 households, showed that most people   
 did their shopping in Wetherby, some  
 five miles away, rather than in       
 Tadcaster which is only two miles.    
 Only a few felt it was worthwhile to  
 shop at either York or Leeds.         
                                       
      For odds and ends the majority of
 people went to Tadcaster.  Most       
 people did their shopping once a week.
 Half the survey thought shopping      
 facilities were adequate even         
 though many prefered to shop in       
 Wetherby because there was more choice
 and variety .  Nearly everybody would 
 like to see a really big supermarket  
 in Tadcaster. If you run out of an    
 item you either borrow, do without or 
 nip into Tadcaster if you have a car. </content>
