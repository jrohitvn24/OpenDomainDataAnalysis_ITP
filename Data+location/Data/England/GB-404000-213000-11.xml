		<title>11THE   CHURCH   IN   YANWORTH</title>
		<content>     Mentioned in{many guide books,}the
 church is well worth visiting.  {Large
{barns and  the tithe barn}are so close
 it seems to belong to the farmyard.   
     The{well kept graveyard}has graves
 back to mid 18 C.{Cast iron monumental
{tablets}are unusual in  Cotswold stone
 country  but less unusual  is the{bale
{tomb.  Round  bullet like  marks }have
 been associated with Cromwell  and the
{scratch  or stick dials }and a {simple
{sun dial}are early cheap time-pieces. 
     The {church is  mostly late Norman
{12 C. with an exterior of fine jointed
{ashlar, a minature embattled tower and
{a fine Norman south doorway.  }Also of
 interest is the{Norman Tub font, stone
{work around the chancel and nave,  the
{15 C. perpendicular  windows  and  the
{fragments of a  16 C. wall painting of
{Old Father Time or Death  _  }skeleton
 figure, scythe, shroud and shovel.    </content>
