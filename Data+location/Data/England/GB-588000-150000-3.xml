		<content> truth I hate it there.What I hate     
 more is people saying how nice it is  
 to live in the country, well it is not
 as they say.There are flies everywhere
 in the summer and in the winter we get
 blocked in by snow. It is alright, in 
 fact it is exciting, for a while but  
 when no-one's with me it starts to    
 get boring.                           
     My name is Nathan Flood and I am  
 eleven years old. I like the          
 countryside because there are lots of 
 woods nearby where I can make camps.  
 In the summer there is an open heated,
 swimming pool, called the Lenham      
 Swimming Club, which is open to club  
 members.  In the winter I go up into  
 Chilston Park and sit on my sledge to 
 slide down the hills. I wouldn't      
 like to live in a town or city because
 of the danger in crossing the roads,  
 the noise and no wide spaces to play. </content>
