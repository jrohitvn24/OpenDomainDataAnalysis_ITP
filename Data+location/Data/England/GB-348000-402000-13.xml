		<content>   One of the most worrying aspects of 
living on Digmoor is the vandalism.    
   The empty houses have become a      
natural target and many have had their 
windows broken.                        
   Freshly painted woodwork on homes   
seems to encourage the ever increasing 
numbers of graffiti artists.           
   The shops have been forced to put   
bars on their windows and many are     
boarded up altogether.                 
   This all presents a depressing sight
to the onlooker. The estate also has an
untidy appearance due to the litter    
which abounds.                         
   Many of the residents have lost     
heart because they feel they are       
fighting a losing battle.              
   The general feeling is that more    
bins are required and a more regular   
road sweeping service.
