		<content> NORTH HILL IS RIDDLED WITH FOOTPATHS  
 AND THE HOLIDAY MAKER IS ABLE TO WALK 
 THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF NORTH HILL. 
 THE FOOTPATHS ARE WELL MAINTAINED AND 
 MANY ARE WIDE ENOUGH FOR A VEHICLE BUT
 VEHICLES ARE NOT ALLOWED.  THERE IS   
 ONE ROAD THAT FOLLOWS THE RIDGE AND   
 THERE ARE PARKING AREAS IN ORDER THAT 
 THE HOLIDAY MAKER CAN ENJOY THE VIEWS 
 AND GO WALKING IN THE HILLS.  THERE IS
 EASY ACCESS TO SELWORTHY WHICH HAS A  
 LONG HISTORY AND IS NOW OWNED BY THE  
 NATIONAL TRUST.  THERE IS A VERY      
 INTERESTING CHURCH AND A TEA SHOP WITH
 A NATIONAL TRUST CENTRE.  ALSO, THERE 
 ARE A NUMBER OF ANCIENT BURIAL MOUNDS,
 CAIRNS AND MORE RECENT REMAINS OF     
 BUNKERS FROM THE SECOND WORLD WAR.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
