		<content> The new Hospital was opened on 17th   
 May by Her Majesty the Queen.She came 
 from London on the 11.16am train to   
 Colchester's North Station.She drove  
 from the station in her black         
 limousine Bentley, which had a shield 
 on the top with the royal coat of arms
 engraved on it.It had a window which  
 curved down from the roof which was   
 like a sunroof.She drove along Cowdray
 Avenue and up past Smiths Do-It-All   
 store, where our class was standing   
 and cheering.She was wearing a green  
 dress and a hat with a veil.She was   
 driven straight to the University of  
 Essex where she met members of staff  
 and some students.When she opened the 
 new Hospital in Turner Road she looked
 around the wards and met the nurses.  
 The Royal visit was the first in      
 nearly 27 years.
