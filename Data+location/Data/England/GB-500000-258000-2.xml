		<title>02Bletsoe Village-Population.</title>
		<content> Bletsoe is a small village with a     
 population of approx.260.As with many 
 villages in this part of North        
 Bedfordshire it has changed over the  
 last thirty years from an agricultural
 to a commuter community.              
 In the early 1960's the largest farm  
 in the village,Castle Farm,was sold   
 and all the workers made redundant by 
 the new owners.These people moved out 
 of the village to find work and so    
 left housing avalible for newcomers   
 able to commute to Bedford and other  
 centres of employment.At the same time
 new building was taking place and this
 housing was also purchased by people  
 who did not work in the village.In    
 1963 40% of the population worked in  
 agriculture today the figure is only  
 12%.The age-sex structure of the      
 village has also changed from an      
 elderly population to much younger.   </content>
