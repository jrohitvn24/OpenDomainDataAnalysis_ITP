		<content>{Henden Manor Farmhouse}               
  Wiiliam Moraunt held his manorial    
 court at this place in 1325.          
  The existing farmhouse dates from the
 16th.C and has a water-filled moat.   
 Extensive restoration work was carried
 out on the recent change of ownership 
 in 1978/9. The main roof beam was     
 found to be badly damaged by fire, in 
 one part being reduced from twelve    
 inches square to about three inches in
 diameter.                             
  Internally there are exposed beams   
 and late 16th.C wainscoting in two of 
 the rooms. The dining-room has panels 
 carved with initials and the date     
 1577.
