		<title>16Fox Farm &amp; the Swell Farms</title>
		<content> Fox Farm is completely a cereal farm  
 with a six bin drying/storage system. 
 The bins are built in a semicircle    
 around a central pit where the corn is
 tipped. 50 hectares were let in 1985  
 for the growing of oil-seed rape, a   
 break crop from continuous corn. The  
 Heythrop Hunt Point-to-Point races    
 were held on this farm for 30 years.  
 The course is now ploughed-up.        
 Swell Buildings Farm employs a manager
 and 2 workers. Barley, wheat and oats 
 are grown. 8 hectares of grass made   
 3000 hay bales in 1985. Summer calves 
 and winter sheep graze the grasslands.
 Swell Hill Farm belongs to Rockcliffe 
 Estate. The house and a few small     
 fields are let to a family who have 7 
 stables, keeping other people's horses
 as well as some of their own. Breaking
 young horses is carried out as well as
 the teaching of horse riding.         </content>
