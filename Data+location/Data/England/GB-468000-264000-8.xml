  The only churches in the area are    
Church of England.There was once a     
Baptist Chapel in Harlestone but this  
is now disused and has been converted  
into a private house.                  
  The two churches are St.Andrew's in  
Harlestone and St.Botolph's in Church  
Brampton.The latter dates from the     
14th.century with restoration in       
Victorian times.It has an ancient      
coffer dated as early as the           
12th.century and the remains of a      
preaching cross in the churchyard.St.  
Andrew's is earlier in date also       
restored in the 19th.century.The lych  
gate and cedar tree in the churchyard  
are striking features.                 
  The Rev.D.Smith is the rector of both
parishes.He lives at Church Brampton.  
Regular services are held at both      
churches on Sundays.                   </content>
