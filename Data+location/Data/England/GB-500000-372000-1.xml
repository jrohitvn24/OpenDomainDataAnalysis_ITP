		<title>01LOOKING AT CHERRY WILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>   The block in which we live has two  
 villages and two housing developments.
 Cherry Willingham is the largest of   
 the villages with a population of     
 about 3000. Reepham is much smaller   
 and lies to the N.W. of Cherry        
 Willingham. Hawthorn Rd. estate lies  
 to the E. of Cherry Willingham and    
 toward Lincoln (which is 6km. away).  
 N.Greetwell lies on the main road to  
 Skegness which passes diagonally from 
 E. to N.W. The main Lincoln to Grimsby
 railway line passes through both      
 villages.                             
   The general terain is slightly      
 undulating (by Lincs. standards) and  
 both villages have many trees around  
 (which is unusual for the area). The  
 area around the villages is farmland  
 with a roadstone quarry in the S.W.   
 corner.                               
                                       </content>
