		<title>15A CHILD'S VIEW OF FAMILY.</title>
		<content> I live in a family of four.I used to  
 live on an estate in a town but in    
 1982 we moved into the country here in
 Penton.It was a big change for me I   
 found it very hard to fit in and most 
 of all I was lonely.I used to go to my
 friends who lives one mile away,but   
 she was working on the farm most of   
 the time.Now I have got friends.I have
 started to go to Guides too. My       
 brother starts school in September.I  
 go to Comprehensive School then.      
 I have a kitten and two cats.We have  
 15 doves,a racing pigeon,four hens and
 a cockerel.I am not lonely anymore!   
 I come in from school at 15.45 and if 
 it is a good day I hang the washing   
 out.I go back inside and set the      
 table.I play outside with my younger  
 brother and feed the animals.I watch  
 television,go for walks and enjoy     
 reading.My Dad works in Carlisle.     </content>
