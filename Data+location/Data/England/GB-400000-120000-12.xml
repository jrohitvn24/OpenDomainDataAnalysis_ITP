		<title>12WOODMINTON HAMLET</title>
		<content> WOODMINTON is a hamlet 1 mile from    
 Bowerchalke centre. It is a hamlet    
 of 18 households; 3 are farm tenants  
 15 are owner occupiers for under 10   
 yrs. There is a population of 10      
 children, 7 retired people (5 are     
 widows) and 14 of working age.,       
 There are 2 farms - 1 beef rearing    
 unit of 55 acres, and a horse breeding
 and arable farm of 223 acres.         
 Six households have 1 CAR: seven      
 have 2 cars, but no bus passes.       
 One elderly widow occupied the larger 
 farm, in the past, since coming from  
 London as a young bride in 1930. Then 
 she found no water or electricity laid
 on, but there was a combined          
 general store and Post Office. There  
 was also a shop selling homemade      
 sweets. The nearest shop now is in    
 Bowerchalke from which bread &amp; grocer-
 ies may be delivered. Postbox at hand.</content>
