		<title>04Friday Bridge Farming</title>
		<content> Friday Bridge is in the middle of rich
 Fen agricultural land. Some is owned  
 by the Council, Martins and the Co-op 
 have quite a lot. Some of the council 
 land is divided into allotments. Some 
 land is worked by smallholders. The   
 big farmers grow mainly barley, wheat,
 sugarbeet, potatoes, onions, beans and
 peas. In addition the small farmers   
 grow courgettes, cauliflowers,        
 cabbages. The fruits they grow on the 
 land are strawberries, raspberries,   
 blackberries, gooseberries. In the    
 north of the area are some fruit trees
 such as apple trees, plum trees and   
 pear trees. There are some flowers    
 grown in the area such as tulips and  
 daffodils. There are not many animals 
 apart from two small flocks of shee, a
 few fat cattle and chickens.
