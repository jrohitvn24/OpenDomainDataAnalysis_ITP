     Most of Yarm High Street is a     
 controlled parking area and you need a
{parking disc}before you can park.     
     A disc is a piece of card with a  
 numbered clock underneath.You turn the
 clock to the current time and leave it
 in the car.This means the{Traffic     
{Warden}can see how long you have      
 stayed.Most people in our survey only 
 stayed for an average of 20 minutes   
 but you can park for{2 hours.         
      This means people can park       
 for shopping and also have time to go 
 and have a look around the shops and  
 get some bits and pieces.             
     Some people have to go and pop out
 and move their cars so it is easier   
 for them to park behind their shops   
 where there are no restrictions.
