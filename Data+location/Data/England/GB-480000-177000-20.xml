		<title>20RECREATION.  TOURISM</title>
		<content> This is a very sought after area by   
 tourists and travellers. To cater for 
 their needs a number of Public Houses 
 offer accomodation, restaurant        
 facilities and bar snacks. Some have  
 play areas for children ,too.         
 In common with many of the rural areas
 of Berkshire some of the large estates
 have been bought up by wealthy        
 foreigners. The Sheik of Kuwait owns  
{Bear Place},Hare Hatch, and uses it as
 a summer residence.                   
                                       
 We were also told that one secluded   
 house had provided a secret meeting   
 place for a Princess and her suitor   
 about 30 years ago.                   
                                       
 There are,however, only the areas of  
 Common Land-as in Knowl Hill-to       
 provide recreation places for local   
 residents.                            </content>
