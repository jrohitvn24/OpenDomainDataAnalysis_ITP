		<content>      A farm typical of this area is   
 Coughton Fields Farm. Farmed by its   
 owner since 1929, it has 127 Friesian 
 dairy cows, about 200 beef cattle and 
 a Hereford-cross bull. Crops for      
 animal feed include barley, fodder    
 beet and grass for hay or silage. In  
 summer dairy cows eat grass in the    
 fields. Calves eat cow cake made from 
 barley, bran and molasses. Beef cattle
 are fattened on barley and sold at    
 Banbury market. The milk goes to a    
 Redditch dairy.                       
      The farm covers 415 acres and six
 people work there. Buildings include a
 10-unit herring-bone milking parlour, 
 bull pens, winter housing for dairy   
 cows, calving sheds and a grain dryer.
 Artificial fertilizers and weed       
 killers are used. Land drainage on    
 the heavy clay has been a major       
 improvement. There are 45 machines.   </content>
