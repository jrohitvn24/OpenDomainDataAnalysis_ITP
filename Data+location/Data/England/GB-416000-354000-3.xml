		<content> Our school has 11 rooms, but only two 
 of them are classrooms. My classrtoom 
 is the junior room. It is a bit bigger
 than the infant class. The infants    
 teacher is Mrs. Birch and our         
 headteacher is called Mr. Williams. He
 teaches 1st and 2nd years and the 3rd 
 and 4th years are taught by Mrs.      
 Davison. The infants teacher, Mrs.    
 Birch, has to teach 23 children and   
 she has been teaching at the school   
 for 28 years.                         
 The new room was built 5 years ago.   
 It's a little room with space for 9   
 adults or l8 children. There is a     
 small cooking kitchen with two        
 cupboards at the end. In one is the   
 food and in the other is the hardware.
 The other rooms are toilets, porches  
 and stockrooms. There are two         
 playgrounds and a lawn.
