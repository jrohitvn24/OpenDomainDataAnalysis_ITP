		<title>17The Warren,Kirkby</title>
		<content> On 14th June a group of children went 
 on a nature survey to an area known as
 "The Warren".This survey was to look  
 for animals,birds,insects,flowers,    
 bushes and trees.Many of the things   
 found could not be identified so a few
 samples were collected and taken back 
 to school.Later some were examined    
 under a microscope.                   
 At the "Warren" are open fields,      
 sandstone banks,an old railway line   
 with filled-in tunnel,woods and a     
 footpath. We saw oak,beech,Scots Pine 
 and Silver Birch trees,gorse,wild rose
 elderberry and hawthorn bushes.Flowers
 included bluebell,buttercup and dande-
 lion. We saw racing and wood pigeons, 
 starlings,sparrows and swifts,a dead  
 shrew,rabbit,horses and dogs.We also  
 saw bees,spiders and a dragonfly.     
  Robin Hood's Cave is now filled up   
 with sand.                            </content>
