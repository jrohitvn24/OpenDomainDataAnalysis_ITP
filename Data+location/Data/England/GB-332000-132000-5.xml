		<title>05PRIMARY SCHOOL TODAY</title>
		<content>   There is one primary school in the  
 village.Everyone seems happy here. We 
 have 6 teachers and a headmaster. The 
 school is busy at all hours,          
 especially now the Tercentenary of    
 The battle of Sedgemoor is coming up. 
 (The last battle on English soil).We  
 have dinner ladies, mums that help    
 work with the children,two cooks and a
 secretary and three cleaning ladies.  
   The staff meet in the staff room    
 when they are not in class or on      
 playground duty.The top class are     
 given grown up jobs like: crisp       
 selling,washing up ,setting out chairs
 and tables. It is great fun. We have a
 playground which is part concrete,    
 part grass.We have made a pond with a 
 rockery around it. Two old buildings  
 in front of the classrooms have been  
 turned into an Exhibition Centre for  
 The Tercentenary.It is{fun}here.      </content>
