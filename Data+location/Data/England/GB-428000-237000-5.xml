		<content>    Dairying is concentrated on only   
 a few farms with the British Friesian 
 breed predominating although the      
 Canadian Holstein has boosted milk    
 yield in recent years. Milk is sold   
 wholesale and collected in bulk       
 tankers.                              
   Beef is produced mainly from        
 Friesian cows crossed with a Hereford 
 bull. Cattle such as Friesian,        
 Hereford cross Friesian, and to an    
 increasing extent Charolais crossbreds
 are also finished for beef.           
   A large number of sheep of various  
 crosses, mainly  north country in     
 origin, are kept. These are mostly    
 crossed with Suffolk rams for fat lamb
 production. Wool is produced from the 
 breeding sheep. There is a small Texel
 flock.                                
   There are three herds of pigs in the
 area, Large White the main breed.     </content>
