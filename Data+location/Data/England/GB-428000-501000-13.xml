		<title>13Communication in the Cowtons</title>
		<content> Until 1979 mail for each village was  
 delivered to the local Post Offices,  
 sorted there, and delivered by local  
 postmen &amp; women. The mail is now      
 sorted at Northallerton and delivered 
 to each house by a postman in a van.  
 There is one delivery per day. Out-   
 going mail is collected twice per day.
 The overall postmark is 'Darlington'. 
 Approx. 70% of the population have    
 their own telephone. There is an un-  
 manned exchange at Cowton crossroads, 
 with 500 numbers in the 'North Cowton'
 exchange. Operator calls and long dis-
 tance go through the Darlington       
 exchange. There are three public tele-
 phone boxes, one in each main village 
 and at Atley Hill. There are notice   
 boards in all villages and local news 
 letters are delivered to all houses.  
 The village shops sell newspapers, and
 a free paper/advertiser is delivered. </content>
