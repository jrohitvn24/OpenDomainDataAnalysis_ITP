		<content> Introduction                          
      This region of farmland lies     
 between the northerly village of      
 Llanwarne and the southerly one of    
 St.Weonard's. It is mainly in the     
 parishes of Llanwarne, St.            
 Weonard's,Pencoyd and Tretire.  The   
 fifty houses and farms are scattered, 
 apart from the additional twelve      
 houses of the Monkton Council Estate  
 (on the A.466).                       
                                       
      There are no community centres   
 except at St. Weonard's and           
 Llanwarne,both just outside this l2   
 km. block, which both have a church   
 and a village hall, the former has a  
 school and a shop.  Another shop,     
 garage and pub lie 2 miles north of   
 the area people tend to use cars as   
 public transport is limited and only  
 along main roads.                     </content>
