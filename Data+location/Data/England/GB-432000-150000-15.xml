		<title>15METHODIST CHAPEL -WILDHERN</title>
		<content> The Wildhern Methodist Chapel was     
 built in 1880, after the previous     
 building was destroyed by fire. At    
 that time a Mr. Butterworth who owned 
 Hatherden House and farm attended the 
 services.His carpenter,Mr. Hunt, made 
 a seat which is still in use in the   
 chapel. Mr. Henry Smith and his family
 were also members and his grandson    
 Harry was organist for over 50 years  
 until his death in 1963. His daughter 
 still lives in Wildhern and is also a 
 member.Oil lamps were used until 1948 
 when the electric light was installed.
 The numbers in the congregation varies
 but when the anniversary is celebrated
 in July each year, a special service  
 is arranged with the visit of a choir 
 and the chapel is usually full.
