		<title>16     Charminster School.</title>
		<content> The original school on that site was  
 built in 1874.None of this remains,   
 and it was replaced in 1958 by a      
 modern establishment and then added to
 in 1966.The school caters for 103     
 children,half of them from            
 Charminster. The other 50 or so come  
 from Sydling St. Nicholas,            
 Frampton,Stratton, Bradford Peverell  
 and other small hamlets. Some of the  
 children walk to and from the school, 
 some travel with their parents in cars
 but many travel on the coaches that   
 operate for the school. In the morning
 a Dorset County Council bus           
 operates,in the afternoon two Bere    
 Regis buses carry the children back   
 and forth. Altogether I think it is a 
 typical, modern primary school.
