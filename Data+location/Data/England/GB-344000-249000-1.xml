 rural communities of Canon Pyon, Bush 
 Bank, and Westhope.Westhope Hill,cider
 orchard and tree covered, dominates   
 the landscape of fields and woods. The
 conically shaped{Pyon Hills}can be    
 seen for many miles.An old Roman road,
 now the A4110 crosses the block. Bush 
 Bank and modern Canon Pyon have grown 
 up along the road.The centre of Canon 
 Pyon village has moved half a mile    
 from the church.The school is situated
 outside the village. Westhope has     
 recently become repopulated with the  
 renovation of many derelict cottages. 
 The land is divided up into tenant or 
 privately owned farms,with dairy and  
 beef cattle,sheep,fruit &amp; grain crops

 varied and many people commute to
