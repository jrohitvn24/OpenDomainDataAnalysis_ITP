		<title>08St.Peters Church,Ropley.</title>
		<content> In the Domesday survey of 1085 the    
 church in Ropley was part of the      
 Hundred of Esselei.The only Norman    
 feature to be seen now is the door in 
 the south transept.The church has been
 extended from these early times up to 
 the end of the 19th century.The bell  
 tower was built at the end of the 14th
 century with a ring of 4 bells which  
 was increased to 5 in 1701 and to 6 in
 1927 when a treble was added.The font 
 is from the 15th century.The Church   
 registers date from 1538 the year in  
 which Thomas Cromwell ordered them to 
 be kept.The church is dedicated to St.
 Peter and is now the main church in   
 the combined parishes of Ropley,West  
 Tisted and Bishops Sutton.The Monkwood
 Mission is also part of the parish.   
 The present vicar is the Rev.A.m.c.   
 Dunn who lives with his family in the 
 Vicarage in Lyeway Lane.              </content>
