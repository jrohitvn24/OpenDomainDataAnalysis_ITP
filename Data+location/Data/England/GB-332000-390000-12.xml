		<title>12The Food We Eat</title>
		<content>  {THREE,3rd YEAR JUNIOR GIRLS,REPORT:}
                                       
  The food we eat mostly in the morning
 is  cereal  which was made  popular in
 USA. Some people have cooked breakfast
 like egg and bacon or  beans on toast.
                                       
{ Some people get  fish and chips  from
{the  chip shop or something like curry
{and  rice.  That is called  fast food.
                                       
  You can also buy food which is  ready
 to just pop into the oven or under the
 grill.  This is often frozen food.  If
 you  eat too much fast food  it is not
 good for you.                         
                                       
{ Women used to bake a lot but now some
{can't because they work and don't have
{enough time.  However some women still
{bake  and they make things like loaves
{pies and cakes.                       </content>
