 I got up and got my porridge for      
 breakfast.   Then I got dressed.   I  
 went to school.   When the school bell
 went I went in.   We had to read.     
 Then we went to maths.   When we had  
 done maths we went to play.   We      
 played IT.   The bell went.   "Oh no  
 Creative Writing"   When we had done  
 Creative Writing we went to the Mobile
 Library.   We had dinner and then     
 dinner play.   After that we had to   
 finish the Creative Writing.   When we
 went out to play we played IT again.  
 After the bell we had rounders.  This 
 is my Creative Writing.
