		<title>16Showjumping in Burton Pidsea</title>
		<content>      I enter competitions with my     
 pony, Bonny over showjumping fences   
 and cross-country fences. In every,   
 proper, jumping or one-day event there
 is a trophy to be won. This could be a
 cup or a shield.                      
                                       
       "Burton Pidsea Carnival"        
 At the Carnival the jumps were        
 showjumping fences. They were over a  
 metre high and very brightly coloured.
     There were four different classes 
 according to the height of your pony. 
 Each class had its own trophy. The    
 Open Class was for the 'Bramhill      
 Riding School' Trophy.                
     Bonny is not very fit at the      
 moment so he didn't jump all the      
 fences. In his clear round the fences 
 were all small but in the next round  
 the gate was too big for Bonny so he  
 didn't clear it.                      </content>
