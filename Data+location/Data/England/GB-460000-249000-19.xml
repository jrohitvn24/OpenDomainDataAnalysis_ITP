		<title>19Daily Life for a Commuter.</title>
		<content>The alarm rings at seven. The commuter 
hurriedly washes and dresses. Breakfast
consists of toast and coffee. The      
twenty minute drive to Milton Keynes   
station is through peaceful green      
fields. But in winter darkness and ice 
make the journey longer and more       
dangerous. The station platform is     
crowded. The forty minute train journey
separates the calm of the countryside  
from the noise and bustle of London.   
People are everywhere. The office day  
begins after a reviving cup of         
coffee. Correspondence needs answering.
A regular meeting with editors,        
designer and the sales manager plans   
next year's new books. Lunch is coffee 
and a sandwich. The afternoon is spent 
at a bookseller's offices selling books
for Christmas. 5pm Crowded bus and     
train.Drive home.Meal at 7. TV. Bed at 
10.30. End of another day's commuting. </content>
