		<content> SELBY STATION IS SITUATED ON THE MAIN 
 LEEDS TO HULL LINE AND HAS AN         
 EXCELLENT SERVICE TO YORK, LEEDS,     
 HULL,AND DONCASTER.UNTIL THE SELBY    
 COALFIELD ARRIVED SELBY STATION WAS ON
 THE MAIN LINE FROM LONDON TO SCOTLAND.
 THE COALBOARD PAID BRITISH RAIL TO    
 DIVERT THE MAIN LINE FOUR MILES TO THE
 WEST OF THE TOWN BECAUSE THE LAND     
 UNDER THE OLD LINE WOULD SINK MAKING  
 THE TRAINS GO SLOWLY.SELBY LOST ITS   
 THROUGH LONDON SERVICE BUT MOST TRAINS
 DID NOT STOP ANYWAY.PEOPLE GOING TO   
 LONDON HAVE TO CHANGE AT DONCASTER.   
 MANY MERRY-GO-ROUND TRAINS FROM THE   
 PITS TO THE POWER STATION PASS THROUGH
 THE TOWN.A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT
 THERE IS A LOT VIBRATION WHICH SHAKES 
 THINGS OFF THEIR TABLES BECAUSE THE   
 TRAINS ARE SO HEAVY.
