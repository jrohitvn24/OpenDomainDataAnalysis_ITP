  The twelve kilometre area is situated
 midway between Newark and Lincoln.The 
 main trunk road which runs nearby is  
 the Fosseway _ the original Roman road
 which ran from Lincoln to Cirencester.
 The area has the border between North 
 Notts and Lincolnshire running through
 it.This is very much a country area   
 with the predominent "industry",being 
 agriculture. The population is low    
 with only two small villages within   
 the area.People who are not connected 
 with farming commute to the larger    
 towns,Lincoln,Newark and Nottingham.  
 Buildings comprise old stone cottages 
 with modern late 20th century housing.
 There are two Norman churches.The main
 Lincoln,Nottingham railway runs       
 through the surveyed area and this    
 provides the facility of a raiway     
 station at Swinderby.                 </content>
