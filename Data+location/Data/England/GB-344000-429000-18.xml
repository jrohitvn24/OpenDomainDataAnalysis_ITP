The Anglican church is dedicated to St.
John the Evangelist and is in Lund-in- 
Salwick, ref 46 31. It is built of     
stone in three stages. The nave was    
built in 1824, the chancel added in    
1852 and the tower in 1873. There was a
private chapel here since 1329 which   
belonged to the Roman Catholic         
Clifton family, but it was pulled down 
in 1824. The most important service is 
the 10.30am Family Communion.
