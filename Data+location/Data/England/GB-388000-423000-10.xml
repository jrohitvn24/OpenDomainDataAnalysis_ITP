		<title>10Flooding in Cornholme</title>
		<content> In 1982 there was a bad flood which   
 was the result of a long dry spell of 
 weather followed by a short torrential
 downpour.                             
 Due to the nature of the terrain the  
 water cascades down the hillsides in  
 various streams and in order to       
 utilise the narrow valley bottom the  
 streams are then led into a culvert   
 and very often houses and factories   
 are built over the culvert.           
 Over a period of time stones have been
 carried down the hillsides and        
 eventually the culvert was restricted 
 unbeknown to anyone. Even though the  
 area has had a history of flooding    
 no-one accepted responsibility for    
 checking the culvert and as a result  
 it was unable to cope with the sudden 
 influx of water and Burnley Road was  
 flooded to a considerable depth and   
 left a trail of destruction.          </content>
