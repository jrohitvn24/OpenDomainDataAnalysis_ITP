 in the Cotswolds.Lewis Carroll stayed 
 there.He was sitting at the top of the
 avenue of trees when he saw a rabbit  
 go down a hole,that is where he is    
 supposed to have got the idea for     
 Alice in Wonder Land.Gloucestershire  
 County Council owns Cowley Manor but  
 during the 1.W.W. Capt. Heber_Percy   
 owned it.the grounds are very         
 beautiful. There are three lakes      
 with islands. 195 acres of surrounding
 land are also part of the manor.People
 come from all over the world to       
 stay. There are 20 bedrooms and 6     
 state rooms.The busiest months of the 
 year are October and November.At the  
 manor they do 22-23 school courses a  
 year, there are also holidays,
