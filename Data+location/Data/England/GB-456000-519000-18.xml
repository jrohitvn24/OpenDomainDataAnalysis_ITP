		<content> The road ways in the D-Block have     
 greatly improved since the A174 was   
 built.This road net work dominates the
 block.The A174 is a dual carriageway  
 which connects minor towns and places 
 like Eston and Lazenby.The majority of
 people use a car or bus.A few young   
 people and a lot of old people have   
 bus passes or fare savers.A lot of    
 people say that a buspass or fare     
 saver can save a lot of money for the 
 people who regularly travel to work by
 bus.The main buses used are 263 and   
 the 274.A lot of people go shopping,to
 ASDA on the Asda bus,a free service   
 supplied by Asda,the main supermarket 
 close to the area.The residents of the
 Almshouses are particularly grateful  
 for the free bus passes.
