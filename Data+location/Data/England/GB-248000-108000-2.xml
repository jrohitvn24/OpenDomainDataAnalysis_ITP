		<title>02PETROCKSTOWE'S LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>{Petrockstowe}is an attractive hilly   
 area, with many thatched cottages made
 of cob or Devon stone, adjacent to    
 metalled roads, but often tucked away 
 down partially-surfaced tracks, hidden
 by Devon banks, surrounded by{grazing 
{land}filled with sheep or cows.  There
 are plenty of trees - oak, beech, ash,
 sycamore and conifers - but many of   
 them are ivy-clad and covered with    
 lichen. Roadside hedges and banks are 
 filled with wild daffodils and prim-  
 roses in Spring, the pinks of campion 
 and foxglove in Summer and thick with 
 blackberries, elderberries and hazel- 
 nuts in the Autumn.   The field owners
 are responsible for cutting the       
 roadside hedges.  Numerous dry-stone  
 bridges take the lanes over streams   
 which act as natural field boundaries 
 and with many springs provide fresh   
 water for the livestock.              </content>
