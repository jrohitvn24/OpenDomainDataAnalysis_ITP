		<title>10TRAFFIC AND ROAD USE</title>
		<content> Cars used to have to go through the   
 Market Place but in 1975 a by-pass was
 built around Cirencester. London Road 
 is one of the busiest roads in the    
 town centre. The busiest time is from 
 9.15 am to 9.30 am when everyone is   
 going to work whereas the busiest time
 on the by-pass is 11.30 - 11.45 am.   
 When roadworks are in progress the    
 traffic is diverted and the area is   
 coned off. Most roadworks are caused  
 by burst pipes, frost and car tyres   
 wearing down the tarmacadam. Most     
 schools have a lollipop lady outside  
 to help everyone cross the road. The  
 Green Cross Code is to help children  
 cross the road safely. Most children  
 in our school know it.                
 Cirencester has a lot of traffic      
 passing through as it is a meeting    
 and crossing place of several major   
 roads.                                </content>
