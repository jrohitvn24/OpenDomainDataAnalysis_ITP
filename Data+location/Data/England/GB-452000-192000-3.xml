there is a Mother and Toddler group and
Playgroup.  For the girls there are    
Brownies, Guides and Girls Friendly    
Society.  For boys there is a football 
club;  other organised interests have  
to be pursued outside the village.     
Fishing in the Thames is also a popular

during the church service the children 
can attend children's church.  The     
adults may attend Drama Club, Bell
