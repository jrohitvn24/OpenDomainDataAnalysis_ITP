		<content> Bedingham is involved in a major      
 church restoration scheme involving   
 the roof &amp; clerestory windows &amp; is    
 also having the century-old organ ex- 
 tensively repaired.The considerable   
 sums of money needed come partly      
 from the community,partly as a loan   
 from the Diocese &amp; partly from a Govt.
 grant,Â£15000 in all. Hedenham has     
 recently bought the old schoolroom to 
 ensure its use as a{village hall.}    
 Both villages have way-marked         
 bridleways &amp; footpaths using South    
 Norfolk DC signs &amp; both have planted  
 trees over the past 15 years - Beding-
 ham as a Parish scheme with NCC help -
 &amp; in both parishes individuals &amp; the  
 estates take up Countryside Commission
 grants for planting on their land.Reg-
 ular events,coffee evenings,sales or  
 auctions, elicit a splendid response, 
 whatever is the current pressing need!</content>
