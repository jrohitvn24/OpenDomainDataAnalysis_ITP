		<title>02MY DAY</title>
		<content> SAt half past seven my dad awakens me 
 by shouting up the stairs .I get      
 dressed and I go down stairs to have  
 some toast and a cup of tea.Then I    
 have a wash and I make my bed and I   
 call for my mate.We set off to school 
 at ten past eight to play football.At 
 ten to nine we go inside to do some   
 work.The morning consists of maths,   
 english and sometimes P.E.When it is  
 ten past twelve we have our sandwiches
 and we go for break.After that we do  
 other work like a project until half  
 past two when it is time for          
 break.Near the end of the day our     
 teacher reads us a story and at half  
 past three it is time to go home and I
 play football.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
