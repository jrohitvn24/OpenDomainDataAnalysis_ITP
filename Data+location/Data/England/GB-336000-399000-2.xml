 by voluntary helpers.Children are     
 addmitted to school at 5 years of     
 age,transfer to junior school at 7+   
 and then to secondary school at

 comprehensive.There is a good choice  
 of schools in the area as there are   
 State schools,Anglican and Roman      
 Catholic schools within reach of most 
 children.Standards are high and many  
 children go on to higher education.For
