		<content> Drayton straddles the Abingdon to     
 Steventon road,the B 4017,about two   
 and a half miles south of Abingdon.It 
 was part of Berkshire until 1974 when 
 reorganisation of county boundaries   
 resulted in it becoming part of the   
 Vale of the White Horse district of   
 Oxfordshire.To the east of the road   
 lie older village houses built mainly 
 of local brick.To the west of the road
 are modern housing estates,private and
 council,the new Drayton Village Hall, 
 built in 1975 and Drayton Primary     
 School,built in the 1950s.The         
 population of Drayton is now          
 approximately 2,600,having increased  
 from the first 1801 census of 484.The 
 village in 1801 was an agricultural   
 village but is now becoming a         
 dormitory for people working in       
 Oxford,Abingdon,Harwell and Culham.   
 There are now only two working farms. </content>
