		<title>06Isolation of a Deaf Child</title>
		<content>We wanted to find out what life was    
like for a totally deaf child living in
an isolated farm in the area.  He is 11
years old.  His parents feel that local
people are not very enlightened and    
tend to treat him as if he was simple. 
He gets frustrated.                    
  He has been going away to school     
since he was 3.  He was very shocked at
first and developed diabetes.  He comes
home every weekend.  The County pay for
his education - 8,000 pounds per annum 
- although he goes to an independent   
deaf school in another County.         
  He enjoys more out of school         
activities than he could participate in
at home.  He goes to "Cubs" and has won
his Gold Award, plays football and     
attends youth club.                    
  He is a pleasant outgoing child with 
a good sense of humour.  He doesn't    
have any special friends.              </content>
