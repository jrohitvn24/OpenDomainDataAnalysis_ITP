		<title>14PUBLIC ATTITUDES TO THE AREA</title>
		<content> better park in the area as the only   
 one is in Crossland Road,and most of  
 the tarmac is broken and it is not    
 really big enough for the area.There  
 are also many busy roads in the area  
 and these require Pelican Crossings.  
 There are no sports centres in the    
 area for either indoor or outdoor     
 activities such as bowling            
 greens,tennis courts or badminton and 
 basketball courts for indoor use in   
 winter time.                          
 There are insufficient bus shelters of
 public telephones in the area.The     
 streets could be kept a lot cleaner as
 there always appears to be litter     
 scattered in the area.
