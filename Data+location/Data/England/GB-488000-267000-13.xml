		<title>13COMMUTING TO THE CAPITAL.</title>
		<content> With the advent of the new 125 trains 
 the journey to the city is less of an 
 ordeal. The journey to work now takes 
 about 50 minutes and this improvement 
 in accessibility has meant a number of
 implications for Wellingborough.      
 Firstly, an increasing number of      
 people have been able to commute to   
 work daily.                           
 Secondly, although there are a number 
 of obvious advantages with this       
 shortening of distance there are also 
 some problems. Trains are often       
 overcrowded, a great inconvenience for
 businessmen who wish to work quietly  
 on the train.                         
 Due to the increase in the use of     
                                       
 these trains land prices have steadily
 risen in Wellingborough, although     
  these are comparitively cheap to the 
 prices of the capital.                </content>
