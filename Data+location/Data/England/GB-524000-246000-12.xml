		<content>     The village lost its right to     
 graze animals on Cow Common in 1908.  
 This land is now farm land along the  
 Eyeworth Road. Animals were allowed to
 graze on Charity Commisioners land of 
 the High Street. That right has since 
 gone and houses have been built there.
     On Good Friday 1887 a new Chapel  
 was opened. This replaced an old barn 
 chapel that had collapsed. A notable  
 village personality named in          
 Kelly's Directory 1885 was Mr. Henry  
 James King, a  farmer living at Home  
 Farm a friend of W.G.Grace,           
 huntsman,J.P. and generous friend to  
 the village.
