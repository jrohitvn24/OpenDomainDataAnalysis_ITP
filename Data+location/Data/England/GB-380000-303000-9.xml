		<content> Much of the landscape in and around   
 Albrighton is flat.Most of the area is
 countryside as Albrighton is enclosed 
 by a green belt.The introduction of   
 the car brought about a lot of the    
 housing development in Albrighton,as  
 most people realised that they could  
 buy a car and move into the country   
 and away from the cities.Albrighton is
 a popular place as it is close to     
 Birmingham and Wolverhampton.The major
 part of the population is comprised of
 older people because young married    
 couples with children cannot afford to
 live here.Hence school numbers are    
 falling.The green belt prevents any   
 more growth so few new houses can be  
 built in the village.There is little  
 factory development the main industry 
 being crops and dairy farming.
