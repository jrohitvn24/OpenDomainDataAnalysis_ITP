		<title>05WORKING IN THE FIELDS</title>
		<content>   My mum,Mrs. Lambert,works in the    
 fields. She does,strawberry,apple,    
 cherry and pear picking. She takes a  
 flask and a big packed lunch.If it    
 rains,she either goes in a big shed or
 a horse van.In the morning a van comes
 to pick her up at the bottom of the   
 hill and takes her to the fields.     
   My mum,Mrs. Bing,used to work in the
 fields.She had to take a packed lunch,
 for her and the children.She used to  
 string hops and pick apples.A van     
 takes you to and from the fields.The  
 women work up and down the rows while 
 the children either play in the dirt  
 or climb trees.                       
   During the holidays the older       
 children help pick the apples and earn
 some pocket money for themselves.There
 is so much fruit in our area that lots
 of it has to be dumped at the end of  
 the season.                           </content>
