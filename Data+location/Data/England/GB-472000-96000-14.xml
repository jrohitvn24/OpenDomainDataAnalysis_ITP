		<content> Hayling is at the moment suffering    
 from a serious lack of entertainment, 
 and what there is is mostly for older 
 people and most of the clubs are for  
 18 year olds. There are very few night
 clubs except for Bennets and the      
 Solent Club. There are no cinemas and 
 only one theatre which is called the  
 Barn Theatre. This is used by drama   
 groups.There is an activities centre  
 where all ages can make entertainment 
 (play bridge) be entertained or play  
 sports such as badminton,aerobics and 
 karate. Old peoples groups,ladies     
 groups and a youth group also meet    
 there. Seacourt Club is a private     
 members only club and offers real     
 tennis,badminton,rackets,lawn tennis  
 and squash. There is quite a big      
 junior section. The beach is the most 
 important aspect and features things  
 like sunbathing,swimming &amp; windsurfing</content>
