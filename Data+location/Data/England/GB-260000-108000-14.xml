 COVER IS ABOUT 9\ ACRES. THE STABLE   
 HANDS HAVE TO GROOM THE HORSES,       
 CLEAN THE STABLES AND ESCORT RIDERS.  
 THEY HAVE 11 HORSES AND 3 PEOPLE WHO  
 WORK ROUND THE STABLES AND IF ONE IS  
 OFF SICK THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYONE TO   
 REPLACE THEM SO THE OTHER 2 HAVE TO   
 WORK EXTRA HARD AND AT THE MOMENT THEY
 HAVE A LOW SUPPLY OF HAY.             
 MOSTLY IN THE EVENINGS THEY HAVE      
 DISCOS.THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY FULL-TIME 
 PEOPLE WORKING IN THE DISCO SO THEY DO
 NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WHEN 
 THEY ARE CLOSED FOR THE WINTER.THEY   
 HAVE ONLY EVER HAD 2 DISASTERS-       
 FLOODING &amp; WIND.                      
 PEOPLE WHO STAY THERE CAN BRING THEIR 
 OWN CARAVANS IF THEY WANT TO.THEY HAVE
 ONLY HAD TO CALL THE POLICE IN CASES  
 OF LOST CHILDREN AND ACCIDENTS.THEY   
 HAVE NOT HAD ANY VANDALISM YET.       </content>
