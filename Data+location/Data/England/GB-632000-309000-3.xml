		<title>03THE BLOFIELD BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The Blofield By-pass was built in     
 1981,to decrease the amount of traffic
 on the A 47 which runs through        
 Blofield.  During the holiday         
 season,holiday makers travelling to   
 Great Yarmouth along the A 47 caused  
 great congestion in the centre of the 
 village of Blofield.                  
   When the by-pass was built,two      
 garages and a fish and chip shop      
 situated on the A 47 lost a great     
 amount of their trade, as people no   
 longer passed them on their way to    
 Great Yarmouth.                       
  The by-pass is a dual carriage       
 way. The only bridge that goes over   
 the by-pass is near Blofield          
 School.It is the largest single span  
 bridge in Norfolk.                    
  The by-pass has made the villages of 
 Blofield and Blofield Heath much      
 quieter.                              </content>
