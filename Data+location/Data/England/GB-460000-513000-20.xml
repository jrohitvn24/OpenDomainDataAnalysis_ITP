		<title>20Guisborough Moorland</title>
		<content> We studied 4 1-metre-squares of moor- 
 land just to the S.of Guisborough for-
 est &amp; near Hutton.We recorded the     
 plants/animals &amp; their abundance. The 
 pH of the soil was 5.5.This acidity is
 due to lack of calcium. 1 square was  
 wet &amp; contained: Calluna vulgaris;    
 Empetrum nigrum; Erica Tetralix; Sph- 
 agnum moss;reeds;liverwort;hay ticks; 
 cuckoo spit.The other 3 contained:    
 Calluna vul.(abundant);Empet.nig.(ab);
 Montia  Fontand(rare);Spaghnum        
 moss(ab);Cuckoo spit;hay ticks.       
 2 visits were made to the moor, on    
 4.7.85 &amp; 14.7.85.The latter was       
 helpful because Calluna vul.&amp; Erica   
 tet. were in flower making them easy  
 to identify.Sounds or traces of       
 pheasant,grouse &amp; curlew were also    
 noted,&amp; the moor was grazed by sheep.
