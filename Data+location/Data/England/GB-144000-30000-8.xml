		<title>08PENZANCE HARBOUR</title>
		<content>  Penzance Harbour has been gradually  
 built over hundreds of years.The      
 harbour in 1985 is very modern. A     
 Harbour-master is in charge of the    
 harbour,working with five other       
 people.At one side of the harbour     
 there is a dock.Built from the dock   
 wall is a pier,at which the Isles of  
 Scilly ferry,called the "Scillonian"  
 waits.Also on this pier is a          
 lighthouse.A road goes through part of
 the harbour,over a swing bridge called
{Ross Bridge,}which opens so that ships
 can get to the dry dock which is at   
 the back of the harbour.The           
 Harbour-master has to make sure that  
 the ships and boats are tied up and in
 no danger of drifting away,and that   
 the harbour is repaired.Some unusual  
 ships have come to the harbour,like   
 Chinese junks,landing craft,salvage   
 ships and mine-sweepers.              </content>
