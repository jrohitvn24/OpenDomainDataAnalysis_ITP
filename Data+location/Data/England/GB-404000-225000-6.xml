		<content> There are no public transport services
 available in this area.  Buses serve  
 nearby villages.  The nearest railway 
 stations are Cheltenham, Evesham and  
 Morton in the Marsh, which are 10 or  
 more miles away.  People who live here
 must therefore depend on their own    
 transport, and need cars or motor     
 bikes.  Farmers also make occasional  
 use of the roads to move heavy farm   
 machinery or for instance to take     
 sheep to market outside the area for  
 instance at Andoversford or           
 Gloucester.                           
 The roads are all minor roads linking 
 villages outside the area such as the 
 Guitings and Winchcombe.  The road    
 from Winchcombe to Hawling is known as
 the Salt Way and follows the line of a
 historic tract.  A narrow road        
 unsuitable for motors. It goes through
 Guiting Wood.                         </content>
