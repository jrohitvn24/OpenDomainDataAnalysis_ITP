		<title>01TEME VALLEY - WEST WORCS</title>
		<content> The river Teme flows West to East     
 across the Southern half of the area  
 through a fertile valley about 1km    
 wide, bounded on each side by higher  
 ground. Hops have long been grown in  
 the valley, and most farms have their 
 distinctive block of kilns for drying 
 the crop. Competition from European   
 hop imports since joining the EEC, and
 a disease of the vines (hop wilt) have
 tended to reduce the dependence on    
 hop-growing, but substantial hopyards 
 remain. The South-facing slope of the 
 valley wall, once mainly orchard, is  
 now more commonly grazed by sheep. On 
 the plateau are two villages of Frith 
 Common and Menithwood, now occupied in
 the main by commuters. A generally    
 wealthy area of high scenic beauty at 
 all times of the year.
