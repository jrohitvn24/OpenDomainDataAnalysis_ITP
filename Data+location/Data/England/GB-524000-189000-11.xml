		<title>11College Farm</title>
		<content> One of the features of Barnet is      
 College Farm, situated at Fitzalan    
 Road,N3. College is unusual because   
 not many farms are found in urban     
 areas.The farm was started 102 years  
 ago and comprised of 300 acres,taking 
 it's name from Christ College, the    
 nearest large building.               
 The livestock of the farm consists of 
 Highland Cattle, ! Jersey cow and one 
 cross-bred cow. The pigs and sheep    
 kept are mainly of rare breeds.The    
 poultry consists of hens, ducks, geese
 and turkeys.                          
 In the barn,now used as a             
 cafeteria,especially on open days,many
 of the original Victorian tiles can be
 seen.                                 
  At the moment the farm is in danger  
 of closing, and a campaign has been   
 started to save the farm.
