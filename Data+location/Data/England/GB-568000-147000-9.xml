		<content> A LOT OF THE APPLE ORCHARDS ON THE    
 NEARBY FARMS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY FOR 
 CEREALS AND CROPS LIKE                
 BEANS,PEAS,POTATOES,BARLEY-GRASS FOR  
 GRAZING HORSES,RASPBERRIES AND        
 VEGETABLES.AT EMMETT HILL THERE WAS A 
 BRICK-WORKS BUT NOW IT IS A POND WHICH
 HAS A LOT OF BIRDS DURING THE YEAR.   
 A TRANSPORT DEPOT HAS VERY RECENTLY   
 BEEN SOLD FOR A NEW HOUSING           
 DEVELOPMENT.WE SAW VERY FEW PEOPLE AT 
 WORK ON THE FARMS. A FEW HOUSES ARE   
 LIVED IN BY PEOPLE WHO WORK ON THE    
 FARMS BUT BARNS,OASTS AND FARM WORKERS
 COTTAGES HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO FAMILY
 HOMES, WHERE THE FATHER COMMUTES TO   
 LONDON OR MAIDSTONE.                  
 PEOPLE DO NOT SEEM TO OBJECT TO THE   
 CHANGES TO THE FARMS SO LONG AS THEY  
 KEEP A SIMILAR APPEARANCE.
