		<title>15MY STAY AT ROCKLEY SANDS</title>
		<content> I was 6 when I stayed at Rockley      
 Sands. I had a lovely time.  I loved  
 swimming in the Tropicana Swimming    
 Pool. Sometimes I played on the sandy 
 beach. It has stones and seaweed.     
 Sometimes we went to the leisure park.
 It was hot and stuffy in the caravan. 
 Having dinner was the best part       
 because it was peaceful, small and    
 different.                            
 My mum enjoyed Rockley Sands and my   
 dad and sister too.
