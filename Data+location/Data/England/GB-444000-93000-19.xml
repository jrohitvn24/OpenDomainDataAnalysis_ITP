		<title>19GURNARD PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> Gurnard was granted Parish Council    
 status by the County Council in 1985, 
 and monthly meetings are held at      
 the Methodist Hall, Worsley Road.     
   In the first Parish meeting topics  
 raised included, cyclists on the sea  
 wall, horse riders on a footpath, dog 
 fouling, road signs, beach cleaning   
 and flower beds. Concern was expressed
 about fouling of grass verges by dogs,
 and there was some doubt as to whether
 by-laws relating to pavements applied 
 also to grass verges. A suggestion was
 made that the erection of chains and  
 posts would prevent cyclists using the
 sea wall, but it was pointed out that 
 this would also create a barrier for  
 people pushing prams.Members also     
 considered the position regarding the 
 footpath between Shore Road and       
 Worsley Road being used by people on  
 horseback.                            </content>
