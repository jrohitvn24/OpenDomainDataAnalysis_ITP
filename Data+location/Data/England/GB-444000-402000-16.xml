		<content> Sandra Couldron owns{four ponies.}She 
 rented the Stables at Rectory Lane,   
 Thurnscoe from Mr. Gascoigne who      
 recently died so his wife owns them   
 now. She rents out{three stables.}One 
 is a double one, to Sandra. She used  
 to own a paddock but the Council were 
 planning to build on it so Sandra had 
 to give it up. There are lots of      
 people, mostly girls who own a horse  
 or pony, who rent a Stable from Mrs.  
 Gascoigne. Sandra has a goat as well. 
 It is in the double stable with Chess 
 and Blossom who are two of her ponies.
 The other two are Annabell and        
 Moonlight. There are about{20 people  
 who go riding with Sandra.
