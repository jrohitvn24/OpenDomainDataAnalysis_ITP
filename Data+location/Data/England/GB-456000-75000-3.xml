 When you walk into the King Charles   
 Hotel it is like walking back into the
 past. Mr. and Mrs. Barton have filled 
 the reception rooms with antiques and 
 chandeliers hang from the ceiling. The
 present hotel was built next to the   
 original Crab and Lobster Inn in 1875.
 It has 25 bedrooms none of which has a
 private bathroom because the situation
 of the hotel makes it impossible to   
 change the plumbing system. About 40  
 people stay at the hotel each week and
 most of them come from the London     
 area. The hotel provides bed,         
 breakfast and evening meals as well as
 packed lunches for school parties.    
 Some rooms have a television and there
 is a games room. About 15 people work 
 at the hotel. There is a restaurant   
 attached to the hotel and this is also
 appreciated by local residents.       </content>
