		<title>02Pakistani family, St Ives</title>
		<content> This Pakistani family have settled in 
 St Ives. They enjoy a Pakistani life  
 style as far as possible. They buy    
 special food from stores in Cambridge 
 or Bedford although there is a van    
 which delivers to their door, weekly. 
 The ladies and girls in the family    
 usually wear Pakistani clothes but the
 men wear Western style clothes to fit 
 in with the men at work. The children 
 are expected to behave as they would  
 in Pakistan but the children          
 researching this report thought the   
 boys are given much more freedom than 
 the girls, who are expected to run the
 home. They feel that everyone is      
 treated the same in this country and  
 that the health service and police    
 work for both rich or poor. They like 
 St Ives because it is clean, quiet and
 there are few racial difficulties.
