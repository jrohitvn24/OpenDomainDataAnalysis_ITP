		<title>13The "Trunce"</title>
		<content>  The{"Trunce"}is the name given to a  
 short cross-country run held every    
 third Monday evening during the       
 summer.The unusual name comes from the
 farm of the same name that the race   
 passes through.The race starts and    
 finishes at Oxspring ,winding up and  
 down the banks of,and crossing (four  
 times) the River Don,often using      
 stepping-stones,which,depending on the
 recent weather,may not be visible!    
  The race regularly attracts over 100 
 runners of all ages,who compete for   
 positions in a league table.Points are
 gained for a top-20 placing,and also  
 for improving on a personal best time.
  The final race of the year is a      
 light-hearted affair,with competitors 
 running in fancy dress costumes.A two-
 man pantomime horse is thought to     
 hold one of the fastest times for an  
 animal of this kind!                  </content>
