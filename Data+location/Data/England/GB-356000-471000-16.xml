around 100 members. Lectures and visits
are organised to places of beauty or   
historic interest and the society      
produces a quarterly news letter on    
subjects of local interest.            
   Every year a major summer event is  
organised. These have included Art and 
Photographic exhibition and village    
history displays. One such event in the
past covered the history of Melling.

Melling; Rose Cottage, Willow

Orchard at Arkholme.
