		<content>{Our area}is on the western side of    
{Wellingborough}and is gradually       
 expanding towards{Mears Ashby.}Our    
 categories include{Farm visits,       
{Hardwick village}and its school,      
{Churches, Local Schools, Leisure and  
 the{Wellingborough Enterprise Zone.   
 Wellingborough has changed            
 considerably since the 1960's, from a 
 small market town to an expanding     
 centre for national distribution of   
 industrial and commercial products.   
 We visited a number of farms in our   
 block, all of which were different.   
 Our block is mainly{agricultural}with 
 a growing urban area. Hardwick village
 was mentioned in the original Domesday
 book.{Recreation}and{places of worship
 are well represented.
