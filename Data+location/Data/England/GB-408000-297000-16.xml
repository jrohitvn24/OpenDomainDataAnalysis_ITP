		<content> The most obvious signs of pop culture 
 and its influence on fashion and      
 social attitudes are to be found among
 the younger people.The pressure of    
 advertising on this impressionable    
 group is so relentless that few remain
 unaffected.Even so,it is relatively   
 seldom that examples of the most      
 extreme and "shocking"aspects of this 
 development are seen.Interest in      
 fashion and social activity has quite 
 a high priority.Eating out is much    
 enjoyed and this is reflected in the  
 number of restaurants that are to be  
 found in the locality.These range in  
 style from the sophisticated          
 special restaurants,to the steak bars 
 and public house restaurants.The only 
 positive sign of gambling activity is 
 the local betting shop,although no    
 doubt much takes place in the home in 
 the form of football pools,etc.       </content>
