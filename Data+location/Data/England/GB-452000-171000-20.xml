		<title>20FRILSHAM &amp; MARLSTON- SUMMARY</title>
		<content> This beautiful area of{South Berkshire
 with its lovely beech woods and fine  
 views, its winding lanes and wild     
 flowers is dominated by the names of  
 the{Palmer, Astor, Ilife and Eling    
 families. They formerly owned most of 
 the area- lived in Marlston Manor,    
 Frilsham Manor, Hawkridge House or the
 farms attached to them. These estates 
 are now broken up. Those feudal days  
 are over but there is no doubt that   
 these{"gentry"}were good employers and
 loved by their employees. We have lost
 a great deal with their passing. The  
 coming of the M4 in 1972 was a bitter 
 blow to the feudal type of life in    
 this area and was much resented by    
 older inhabitants. New ways of life   
 now-but old values live on.
