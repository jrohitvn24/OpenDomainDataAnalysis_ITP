		<content> On June l5th. l985 The centre of      
 Barrowby was closed to vehicles and a 
 series of stalls and games were set   
 out, the proceeds went towards        
 improving local amenities. The        
 following is made up of extracts from 
 a 10 year old's account of the        
 festivities.                          
 "I looked around Stephen's Gutter and 
 there was a lucky dip, a splat the rat
 and a game where you had to kick a    
 football through some tyres."         
 "After dinner I got brightly dressed  
 as a medieval archer. I paid 25p      
 entrance fee for the fancy dress      
 competition; judged by the Gala       
 Queen."                               
 "The man on the loudspeaker said that 
 some races were going to be held. I   
 had a go at the obstacle and running  
 races. I won a sweet in the egg and   
 spoon race."                          </content>
