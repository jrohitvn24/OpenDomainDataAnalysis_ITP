		<content> Linkenholt Cricket Club was started in
 the 1920's, re-formed in 1946 after   
 the Second World War and still going

 some from villages round-about. They  
 are placed in Hampshire County        
 Division 3.                           
 The Club has about 50 Vice-Presidents,
 a chairman, Treasurer and Secrearies, 
 all being local supporters.           
 Eighteen League matches were played on
 Saturdays and 18 friendly matches     
 played on Sundays.                    
 Teas are arranged and served by       
 players' wives.                       
 Youngsters are also encouraged to play
 in matches and take coaching.         
 The field and pavilion are loaned from
 the Linkenholt Estate.
