		<title>02Over view of Hanley Castle</title>
		<content> Hanley Castle the smaller of the      
 two Hanley villages is older and      
 was mentioned in the Domesday of      
 1066.In those times it was famous     
 for its castle,but sadly only         
 knowledgeable archaeologists could    
 trace its position today.Hanley       
 Castle is a miniature village with    
 a green, inn, black and white timbered
 cottages and a church.On one side of  
 the green is the school which has a   
 foundation dating back to the 14th.   
 century,and is today a High School.   
 Very little seems to have changed     
 over the centuries in this picturesque
 village.Local and visiting artists    
 are often seen at work during all     
 seasons of the year,capturing this    
 typically English scene on canvas.
