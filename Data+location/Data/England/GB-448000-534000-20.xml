		<title>20HENRY SMITH'S SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> The school is divided into three site-
 s,namely King Oswy Site,St Peter's si-
 te and the Humanitites block.I do not 
 frequently use the St Peter's site as 
 it is mainly for older pupils.The sch-
 ool has a wind band which has done we-
 ll in competitions and an orchestra w-
 hich has been formed recently.Henry S-
 miths have several sports teams inclu-
 ding football,rugby,athletics and swi-
 mming which all take part in local    
 competitions.I am in the athletics sw-
 imming and rugby teams.The school has 
 a lot of leisure amenitites for pupils
 to use in there leisure time e.g. Swi-
 mming Baths,Discos,a computer club,and
 Chess Club.There is a disco for years 
 1,2,and 3 at Christmas. Pupils also   
 frequently  go on trips out of School 
 to places like the theatre.There is   
 also a sports hall to play football,b-
 asketball,or other sports in.K.CHYNE13</content>
