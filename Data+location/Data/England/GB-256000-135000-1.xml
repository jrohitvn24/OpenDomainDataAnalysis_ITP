		<content> The area covered in this survey lies  
 mostly within the parish boundaries of
 Shirwell.  The parish does in fact    
 stretch southwards almost as far as   
 Barnstaple itself.                    
   Shirwell lies among the foothills of
 Exmoor, famous for its sheep which are
 descended from the forest breed       
 indigenous to this part of England.   
 The district is extremely rural and,  
 apart from the A39 which transects the
 area, almost all roadways are very    
 little more than single track and many
 are unsurfaced and so unsuitable for  
 heavy vehicles.                       
   Farming is the main industry of the 
 region and several of the farmhouses  
 are owned by the National Trust.  Many
 of the buildings in the area are in   
 the 'listed' categories.              
   Education is available only in very 
 small village schools.                </content>
