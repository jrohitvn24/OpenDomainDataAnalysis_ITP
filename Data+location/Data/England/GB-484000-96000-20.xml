 staff and pupils of Sidlesham C.P.    
 School. The information was collected 
 by the first ,second, and third year  
 junior children assisted by governors 
 parents and teachers.                 
      Many people in the village gave  
 information by letter,telephone or in 
 person.                               
      There are only three classes in  
 the school now, seventy children in   
 all. The teaching is done by two full 
 time staff and a half time teacher who
 shares a class with the headteacher.  
 Children are taught in classes which  
 contain two year groups.
