		<content>  This area, consisting mainly of the  
village of Rainford and the hamlets of 
Crank and King's Moss, lies about 15   
miles from central Liverpool.The       
nearest big town is St.Helens,but Skel-
mersdale New Town is not far away.Road 
connections are good and there is a    
railway station near to Rainford.      
  Rainford is mainly a dormitory area, 
but Crank and King's Moss are partly   
dormitory,partly farming orientated.   
There is much grassland and the land is
dotted with small copses.The Industrial
Estate employs a large number of people
but otherwise the main local employment
is farming.                            
  Rainford and Crank are both now in   
Merseyside,but in the past they were in
Lancashire-even now part of King's Moss
is in Greater Manchester,part in       
Merseyside and part in Lancashire.
