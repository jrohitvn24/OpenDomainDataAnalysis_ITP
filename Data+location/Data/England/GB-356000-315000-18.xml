		<content>  When the A5 from Shrewsbury to       
 Telford was being repaired in the     
 Spring of 1985,there was a noticeable 
 increase in the volume of traffic     
 using the B5062 road.This increase in 
 traffic made crossing the road by the 
 children of the school more difficult 
 and dangerous. At the same time it was
 anounced by the County Council that   
 they may dispose of the school        
 crossing patrol. This understandably  
 caused great concern amoung the       
 parents and after representations and 
 protests were made the County relented
 and are to keep the crossing patrol   
 for the time being.                   
  High Ercall roads are also used by   
 M.O.T.E.C. who train bus and lorry    
 drivers from their local base just    
 outside our area.                     
  During the Autumn months the road is 
 also used by heavy sugar beet         </content>
