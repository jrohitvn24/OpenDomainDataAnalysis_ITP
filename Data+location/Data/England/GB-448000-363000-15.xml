		<title>15GAMES CHILDREN PLAY (b)</title>
		<content> Another game played by children,      
 mainly the girls, is 'French          
 Skipping'.At least three players are  
 needed for this game. Also a large    
 length of elastic which has the ends  
 joined or tied, forming a continuous  
 loop. Two people stand with the       
 elastic round their legs and the      
 elastic extended, a third person jumps
 from one end to the other, placing    
 their feet on the elastic to hold it  
 on to the floor with each jump at the 
 same time singing the song 'bay scout 
 walk out'. If the person jumping      
 misses putting the elastic to the     
 floor with either foot then they take 
 the place of one of the people holding
 the elastic around their legs - and so
 the game goes on.
