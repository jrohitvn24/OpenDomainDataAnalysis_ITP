 I joined a judo club about 3 years ago
 Judo is a sport, where you practise   
 throwing and falling on mats with a   
 partner.In a real competition there   
 are two people, one wears a red belt, 
 the other a white one.There is a red  
 line around the mats. The point of the
 game is for either one to throw the   
 other over the red line only using    
 throws and trips. Every 6 months there
 is a grading of everybody,when you    
 receive a belt.The first belt is      
 white,then white with a red tag, then 
 on through until white with 3 red     
 tags.These are called mon.When you    
 have 3rd mon you go on to             
 yellow,orange,green, blue, brown,     
 black then white with 3 red blocks and
 finally red. Only one man has a red   
 belt - he is a 90 year old Japanese   
 man.                                  </content>
