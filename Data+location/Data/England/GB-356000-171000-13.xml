		<title>13Shopping Survey, Bristol</title>
		<content> We sampled 82 shoppers on several days
 outside a small food store in         
 Bedminster.  Of these 82, we found:   
 The average number of visits (4 p.w.) 
 60% go food shopping 3+ times p.w.    
 57% used the store as "convenient"    
 83% use local supermarkets as well    
 ...5l% walking there                  
 ...47% driving there                  
 42% use distant Super Stores as well  
 ...74% driving                        
 ...6% free bus (provided by store)    
 ...1% bus                             
 When we asked if they would shop at a 
 large supermarket/store if very close 
 82% Yes; 18% No.                      
 We think that about 18% of our sample 
 is not able to travel far because of  
 age, illness, babies or lack of car.  
 These shoppers need the service of    
 small local shops.
