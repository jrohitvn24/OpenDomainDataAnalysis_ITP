		<content>  Kington is in the county of Hereford 
 and Worcester. Its population is just 
 under 2000. It is the smallest of the 
 six Herefordshire market towns. Market
 day is Thursday. The market is mainly 
 concerned with sheep. There is a great
 variety of shops because there is no  
 competion from surrounding areas.     
 Examples of shops include furniture,  
 pet shop, hardware, foodshops and     
 clothes shops which also sell make up 
 and jewellery. The trouser factory is 
 the biggest employer, mosty of women. 
 The golf course on Bradnor Hill is the
 highest in England and Wales. Hergest 
 Croft Gardens attract many visitors in
 summer. Offa's Dyke is close to the   
 town and brings many keen walkers to  
 the town. However, tourists generally 
 pass through Kington on their way to  
 Wales, just stopping eg for a meal    
 rather than for a holiday.            </content>
