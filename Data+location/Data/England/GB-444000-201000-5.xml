		<content>     Most  of the farmers are concerned
 about  the  environment,  there are no
 prairie-sized  fields,  the  old field
 names   and   field   boundaries  have
 survived.  In some stock rearing areas
{hedgerows} have  been replaced by wire
 fencing.     In   Eaton   there   were
 complaints  that shelter had been lost
 because  too  much  hedging  had  been
 removed.   One  villager  showed  burn
 marks  on  her  arms said to have been
 caused by sprays blowing onto her.    
     All the elm trees have disappeared
 as the{Dutch Elm disease}killed them. 
     Straw  burning  is  now rigorously
 controlled, but because straw will not
 rot  easily  when turned into the clay
 soil  farmers  prefer to burn and gain
 the potash.                           
    Because  there  are no sheep cereal
 farmers  are  not  worried by foxes so
 the hunt is not allowed on their land.</content>
