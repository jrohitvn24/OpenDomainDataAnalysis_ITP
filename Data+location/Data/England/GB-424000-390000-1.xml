		<title>01BRADFIELD AREA.</title>
		<content> The area around Bradfield is one of   
 great natural beauty.The village      
 itself is divided into two parts-High 
 and Low Bradfield.As the name suggests
 High Bradfield is situated at the top 
 of the hill and Low Bradfield lies in 
 the valley at the bottom.The houses   
 are nearly all of stone mellowed by   
 age with just a few new ones which in 
 time will blend in with the old.It is 
 hilly rather than mountainous country 
 lying at the edge of the Peak National
 Park.There are many coniferous woods  
 bordering the reservoirs but not many 
 decidous trees.Much of the land is    
 moorland covered with heather &amp;       
 bracken.This is also farming country; 
 the higher ground providing grazing   
 land for sheep farmers &amp; the lower    
 used by a few farmers as pasture land 
 for their dairy cattle.
