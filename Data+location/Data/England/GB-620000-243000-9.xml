		<title>09Landfill Site,      Kesgrave</title>
		<content>   There is a Suffolk  County Council  
landfill site in our area, formerly a  
disused sand and gravel pit.   It has  
been in use since  1982.   The annual  
input  of  waste  is  99,300  tonnes.  
Household   waste  collected  by  the  
District Councils accounts for 38,000  
tonnes  and  another 15,800 tonnes is  
brought   direct  to  the   site   by  
individual   householders.   The site  
deals  with  about  2,000  tonnes  of  
rubbish every week.                    
   The  large  pits  at  the site are  
filled with  rubbish and then covered  
with  topsoil so that the land can be  
used  for farming again. It will take  
another  two and a half years to fill  
up this landfill site.    Some of the  
refuse  can be salvaged and recycled.  
It  takes   600  dustbins  to  fill a  
dustcart and  there  are 19 cartloads  
brought  to  the  site  each weekday.  </content>
