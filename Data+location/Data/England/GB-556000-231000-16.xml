		<title>16"BROADOAKS",WIMBISH</title>
		<content>     Mr.and Mrs.McLoed have lived at   
 "Broadoaks"for 25 years.When they     
 first moved in there was no           
 electricity.The original house was    
 built in 1560,and part of it remains  
 as it was,whilst other parts were     
 rebuilt in the 19th.century.The       
 grounds cover 240 acres,including a   
 farm and large gardens as well as a   
 hard tennis court.                    
     The{staircase}has been renewed    
 recently and the{panelling}in the     
 drawing room has been replaced.The    
 dining room wall is original,and so is
 the fireplace on the landing.         
     The most interesting feature of   
 "Broadoaks"is a{priest hole}which     
 opens from the chapel fireplace.This  
 was built in 1569,and the priest{John 
{Gerrard}hid there for about four days 
 in 1593,and was not found although the
 soldiers ransacked the house.         </content>
