		<title>03The village of Spaunton</title>
		<content> A single street village of 3 farms,1  
 small holding &amp; 10 houses one of which
 is cruck construction &amp; several       
 outlying cottages. One problem of     
 living in Spaunton today is that the  
 water has to be pumped up the hill    
 from Lastingham so when there is no   
 electric power,there is no water.     
 At one time a{Mell Supper}was held in 
 someones barn when the last of the    
 harvest was brought in. Huge hams     
 together with game pie &amp; frumenty were
 served. Gale beer was drunk,this was  
 made by pouring boiling over a small  
 bunch of gale or bog myrtle,adding    
 lemons,nettles &amp; sugar. After supper  
 the tables were cleared away &amp; a      
 fiddler played. Corn dollies made from
 the last sheaf of the harvest were    
 always hung from the rafters to ensure
 next years harvest.
