		<title>10Travelling by Train.</title>
		<content>   I travel to school most days by     
 train with a small group of children  
 from school.We get a{free pass}from   
 Hampshire Ed.Auth.because we go to a  
 Catholic School and there is only one 
 in the area.                          
   I catch the 8.21a.m. from Netley and
 it takes just about 7mins.to get to   
 Woolston.After school I catch the     
 3.36pm.back.                          
   In the morning the train will not be
 very full but sometimes in the evening
{I can't find a seat.                  
   The train is not very modern.You sit
 on upholstered bench seats facing each
 other and there is only one toilet for
 the whole train.There is{Graffiti}on  
 the inside walls of the carriage and  
 some of it is not very nice.          
   I enjoy travelling by train,though, 
 because it is somehow{more exciting   
 than car or bus.                      </content>
