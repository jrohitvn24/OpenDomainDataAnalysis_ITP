		<title>14STIBBINGTON'S TROUT FARM</title>
		<content>  The Trout Farm was set up 10 years   
 ago.  The trout first came  from the  
 Lincolnshire fisheries,and now the    
 farm gets 1,000 per year. They are not
 sold but are bred to be fished for in 
 a 3 acre gravel pit. The farm never   
 has more than 2,000 fish in total,at  
 one time, costing about Â£133 a month  
 in food.                              
  The present manager has worked with  
 fish for 22 years; his job now        
 sometimes involves working from 4.30  
 in the morning to 10 o'clock at night.
 Although the farm is well protected   
 there is a constant problem with pike 
 and herons which eat the trout if not 
 prevented.                            
  At present,the tickets for fishing in
 the trout lake cost Â£15 for a full    
 day,Â£8 for a half day.
