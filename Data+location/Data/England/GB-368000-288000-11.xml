		<title>11A BOY'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</title>
		<content>    {My life}started on October 10th.  
 1974 when I was born in Wolverhampton.
 I had one or two close shaves when I  
 was younger; when I was five, I opened
 someone's garage door and found a     
 wheelchair. I played with it, and     
 finished by pushing it down the bank. 
 Just then the owner came, so I        
 scarpered like mad. I wouldn't like   
 that to happen again.                 
                                       
     I like drawing, sprinting and     
 karate. My Dad's job is in            
 advertising; he does advertisements   
 for the T.A. to get more recruits.    
                                       
     I am not looking forward to going 
 into the Secondary school, as they are
 very strict! My ambition is to be in  
 the S.A.S.
