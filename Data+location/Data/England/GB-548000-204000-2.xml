		<title>02New House Farm</title>
		<content> In Vicarage Lane there is a farm house
 called New House Farm.  We found out  
 that New House Farm house is not      
 connected to New House Farms land.    
 Mr Kerr owns New House Farm and       
 Wylding Tree Farm..He does not need 2 
 houses. At New House Farm they have   
 about 3 working men.  On the farm they
 keep calves.  They have up to 300 to  
 400 calves.  They keep them up to 4 to
 7 weeks.  They send them off after    
 twelve weeks to be fattened on another
 farm.  They also keep three geese as  
 pets and they guard the land.  They   
 have three tractors and a special     
 lorry to carry the calves and cows.   
 It is two storeys.  The calves go on  
 the top floor.  They climb a special  
 ramp.  They use the tractors to get   
 the grass to make the hay to give out 
 to the calves in the winter.
