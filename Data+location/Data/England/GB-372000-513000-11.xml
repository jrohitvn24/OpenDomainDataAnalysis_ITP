		<title>11Rushbearing in Warcop</title>
		<content> The old custom of Rushbearing has been
 followed for centuries.No one knows   
 when it started but in the days before
 churches had stone floors,rushes were 
 spread over the floor and were changed
 once or twice a year,and it was given 
 a name Rushbearing.Rushbearing is on  
 the 29th of June.At 2'oclock all the  
 people marching gather outside the    
 reading room with crowns and crosses. 
 The crosses are made of reeds and the 
 crowns are made of flowers on a wooden
 frame.We march up to Eden gate and    
 back to the hall at Mrs Woodburn's for
 some pop and crisps.After that we go  
 to church and have a service.Then we  
 go to the Temprance hall for a proper 
 tea.After that we go to the races and 
 get money for marching and winning    
 races.
