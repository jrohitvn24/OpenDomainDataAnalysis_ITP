		<content>Outside there is a graveyard with new  
and old grave stones.Two benches stand 
there,one which is in memory of an old 
member.Long grasses lead round to the  
left where a Â£hall'  is separate       
from the main building.Outside the     
porch,on the left there is an old iron,
boot or shoe scraper where people would
scrape mud and dirt off their shoes    
before they enter the church.The narrow
windows were the style of the Normans. 
The chancel has two candles and a      
sparkling clean cloth.A wooden rail    
above the step is used for communion.  
Below the steps are long cushions with 
a tapestry covering.The floor is made  
of wood.The chancel pews have beautiful
delicate carvings,which would have been
carved by hand by a skilled craftsman. 
     One of the grave stones has been  
in the graveyard since 1486.
