		<title>01CENTRAL BOLTON</title>
		<content> Our area,Heaton and The Town Centre is
 at the heart of Bolton Metrolpolitan  
 Borough.Bolton offers much as a place 
 of historic interest,a shopping centre
 and an arts and entertainment centre. 
  Textiles,motor vehicle components and
 engineering have been the major       
 industries in the area but these,     
 particularly the cotton industry, have
 suffered a recent decline.Many of the 
 cotton mills have been demolished and 
 less than half of those remaining have
 a single occupier. About a third have 
 multiple occupancy and the others are 
 vacant or underused.                  
   Until recently many of the houses   
 near the town centre were high density
 terraces over 60 years old. Now the   
 area is being modernised.Houses are   
 being renovated or replaced and the   
 old grid pattern of streets is being  
 replaced by cul-de-sacs               </content>
