		<content> Mrs.Blakeley was born in Corby and    
 moved to Brigstock when she was 9.    
 She has a part-time teaching job in   
 Stanion. She met her husband when she 
 was a member of Corby Operatic        
 Society. She has a son aged 20 who    
 works at RS Components and an 18 year 
 old daughter who has just finished a  
 course at Tresham College Corby. She  
 also has a 9 year old girl. She says  
 that there are hardly any strangers in
 the village and most people work      
 outside the village. They once worked 
 on farms or in the woodland, the      
 clothing factory or the timberyard.   
 There are a number of social          
 activities in the village to which she
 belongs - Brigstock Historical        
 Society, the WI, and the Parochial    
 Church Council, and plays the church  
 organ.  She likes living in Brigstock.
