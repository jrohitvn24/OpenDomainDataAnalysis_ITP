		<title>11The Basingstoke Canal,Woking</title>
		<content>  The Basingstoke Canal which runs     
 through our block was begun in 1788   
 and opened in 1794, linking           
 Basingstoke to the Thames via the Wey 
 Navigation at Byfleet. It has been    
 disused for many years and the water  
 has become stagnant.                  
  Parts are being rebuilt by volunteers
 from the Basingstoke Canal            
 Preservation Trust who are also       
 clearing it of the silt and weeds     
 which have choked it for many years. A
 new canal-side restaurant has been    
 opened at Bridge Barn and it is hoped 
 that the renovated canal may become a 
 local amenity instead of an eyesore.  
  The lock by the Sheerwater Road has  
 been rebuilt and is standing empty at 
 present. The wooden bridge over it has
 been renewed and the tow path has been
 cleared of brambles and re-gravelled.
