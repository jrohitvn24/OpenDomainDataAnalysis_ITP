		<title>03VILLAGE EVENTS IN GRAFTON</title>
		<content> A number of events are held in the    
 village every year. The Strawberry    
 Fair is held on the school field in   
 July. This is a joint village and     
 school fete with the school sports    
 being held before the stalls open.    
 The stalls include guessing the weight
 of the lamb and a roller coaster made 
 out of a bale elevator. Also in the   
 summer the villagers have a pig-roast 
 at Fisher's Farm. An actual barn is   
 used for the local barn-dance, and    
 also in the autumn a Halloween Disco  
 is held in the village hall. A number 
 of car-boot and jumble sales take     
 place during the year at the Village  
 Hall to raise money for village       
 activities. When there is a very      
 special occasion everyone in the      
 village gets together and organises a 
 street party. At the School Christmas 
 Fair, Father Christmas pays a visit.  </content>
