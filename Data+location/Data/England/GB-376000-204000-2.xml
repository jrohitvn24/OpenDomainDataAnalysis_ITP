		<title>02Eastington Village</title>
		<content>    The population of approximately    
 1500 people is centred on the village 
 of Eastington which consists of a     
 variety of property ranging from the  
 17th. &amp; 18th. century buildings set   
 along the Bath and Stonehouse roads,  
 to the two modern housing estates.    
                                       
    The first estate was built by the  
 Council during the 1950's on land     
 opposite the Victoria Inn.            
    Extra houses ,including an elderly 
 people's complex, have continued to be
 added, the latest being built this    
 year - 1985.                          
                                       
    The second estate,Swallow Croft was
 built on land on the East side of the 
 Stonehouse road  during the 1970's.   
    Until the infra structure is       
 improved all future development will  
 be restricted to "infill" building.   </content>
