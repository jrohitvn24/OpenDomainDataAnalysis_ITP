		<content> This is an area of chalk upland       
 reaching almost 200 metres, with a    
 north facing escarpment that is mainly
 wooded with mature deciduous trees.   
 One stream flows northwards, rising   
 above the Wooliffe pond and flowing   
 into the River Rother. Southwards is  
 a dip slope which is desected by      
 several dry valleys which minor roads 
 run through. This area was originally 
 chalk turf but it is now woodland     
 planted by the Forestry Commission.   
 This forest is interspersed with      
 arable fields of mainly cereal crops  
 and some grazing land. The old lime   
 workings on the scarp slope are now   
 wooded and little shows of the        
 excavations. Southwards (particularly 
 from the Ditcham area) is a splendid  
 panorama, with distant views of the   
 Solent &amp; Isle of Wight. Most of the 20
 dwellings are built of malm &amp; flint.  </content>
