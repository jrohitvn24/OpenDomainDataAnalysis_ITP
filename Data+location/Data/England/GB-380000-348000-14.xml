Although each parish in the block has  
its own parish church. the most        
noticeable feature of religious life   
in the area is the importance of {     
Methodism, one form of which, the      
Primitive Movement, had its birth at   
nearby Mow Cop.   Each hamlet has its  
Methodist Chapel, mostly still         
functioning for worship and as a       
social centre.   The Sunday School     
movement still flourishes in the area, 
in both church and chapel, but young   
people tend to "grow out" of it more   
quickly now.   The local schools,      
though not necessarily having any      
definite connection with any church,   
try to keep a link with them.   The    
High School in Chesterton invites      
ministers from local churches into     
school on special occasions.           </content>
