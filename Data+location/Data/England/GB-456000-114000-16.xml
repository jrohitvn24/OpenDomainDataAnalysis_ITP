		<title>16TRAVELLING TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{James:}Every day I walk to school on  
 my own.  I don't walk very far.  Mrs. 
 Finch is the lollypop lady who helps  
 you across the road.                  
{Charles:}Mum drives me up to school   
 nearly every day.  Mrs. Sealey        
 sometimes takes me to school.  We park
 in Mason News car park.               
{Susie:}I walk to school and I go with 
 my Mummy.  It is round the corner and 
 across the road, up the hill and      
 across the road again.  It takes about
 ten minutes. The roads are quite quiet
{Emma:}My Mummy goes to school every   
 morning but she has to stop every two 
 minutes.  She picks up three people   
 and sometimes five.  We all park in   
 the teachers' car park.  It is usually
 noisy and there is quite a lot of     
 traffic about.  It takes ten minutes  
 to get there.  It is very crowded in  
 the car.                              </content>
