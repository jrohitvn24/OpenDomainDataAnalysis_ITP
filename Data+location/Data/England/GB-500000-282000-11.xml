 Lilford village was once totally owned
 by The Lord of Lilford Hall, but now  
 the village is almost completely      
 privately owned, with only five       
 tenants paying rent to Lilford Hall.  
 All the other houses in the village   
 are either owned by local farmers or  
 by people who have moved from large   
 towns and have decided they prefer    
 country life to city life.            
 The only public amenity is one small  
 post box.
