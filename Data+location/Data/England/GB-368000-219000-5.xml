		<content> The most popular, apart from Football,
 are{Poison, TreeTag or ShipShore.}In  
{Poison}one person shouts "Last one on 
 the wall is on it for Poison". You run
 across and if you get tagged you are  
 "on it". When all are caught you start
 again.                                
{TreeTag}uses two bases, like our      
 Netball Circles.Someone is "on it"    
 then everyone starts in one circle.   
 They try to run across to the other   
 and if tagged they stand with legs    
 apart and arms out like a tree. To    
 free them someone must go through     
 their legs or under their arms.       
{ShipShore.}Someone is "on it" and one 
 wall is Ship the other Shore. The     
 person on it shouts "Ship" or "Shore" 
 or "Scrub the Decks" and the last one 
 to do the action is out. When one     
 person is left they are "on it".
