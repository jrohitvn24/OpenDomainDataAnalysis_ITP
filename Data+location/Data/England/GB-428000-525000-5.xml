Play times are welcomed by every child.
Children invent many games. Here, some 
are explained:                         
Football: You have to win the ball and 
pass it among your team and score in   
the opponents goal. The winner is the  
team that have scored the most goals   
after a fixed period of time.          
Tiggy: is a game where one chosen      
person has to chase the rest of the    
children. If they catch up to someone  
and touches them with his or her       
hand then the person they touched      
chases the others.                     
Racing: is a game where all the        
children (except one) face in the same 
direction but still stand in a straight
line (not facing each other). When the 
one not participating says "Go" they   
run to a fixed point. First there wins!</content>
