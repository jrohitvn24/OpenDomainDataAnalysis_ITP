		<title>18Amusement Arcades</title>
		<content> Arcades vary from a building with just
 a few slot machines to one with many, 
 plus a pool room,bingo and cafeteria. 
 Coloured flashing lights and pop music
 attract people to them.Coins are put  
 into machines by persons hoping to win
 money,often on games of chance.  Some-
 times a little skill is called for by 
 guiding a grab or a ball.Up to Â£1.50  
 winnings are paid out in 10p coins but
 over that amount is paid in tokens    
 which are then used for further games.
 In some cases,10 tokens can be changed
 for One Win on the Bingo.There are    
 cashiers to give change and bouncers  
 in case of trouble.Most of the punters
 are teen-age holidaymakers.No local   
 people are allowed in some of the     
 arcades as they know the machines so  
 well and can fiddle them.
