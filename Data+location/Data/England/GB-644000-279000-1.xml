		<content> We live in an unchanging agricultural 
 area bounded by the old Ipswich - Gt  
 Yarmouth Coach Road on the West (A145)
 and the newer A12 trunk road to       
 Lowestoft on the east. Wangford is the
 'big' village with shops, pubs,       
 community centre and garage. But is   
 geographically small.                 
 Uggeshall-Stoven-Frostenden are       
 widespead but sparsely populated      
 parishes.                             
 While some people still work on the   
 land and in related industries we have
 many who travel daily to Lowestoft,   
 Southwold and Norwich etc for work and
 education.                            
 The attractive nature of the district 
 hs brought us many people who have    
 retired or are seeking a restful      
 environment. The area is extensively  
 farmed but this is complimented by the
 valley of the Wang with its fens      </content>
