		<title>13History of Winster</title>
		<content> In 1066 Winster know as Winsterine    
 meaning thorn bushes covered 12 acres 
 of taxable land and a substantial     
 wood. Present Church on site of       
 Norman Chapel.                        
 Elizabeth 1 in 1596 restored grant    
 of lead mining trade. Late 17th       
 century, population 600 at which time 
 a village now abandoned existed, west 
 of Miners Standard Inn, called        
 Islington. Winster lead industry      
 boomed. Population rose to 2000 around
 1720 - 1770.                          
 Most of present village built in this 
 period.                               
 Population fell with drop in lead     
 prices and substantial flooding of    
 mines and has remained at figure of   
 780 since 1801.                       
 Winster was a market town and also    
 held fairs. These ceased around 1870. 
 Wakes Week is held in late June.      </content>
