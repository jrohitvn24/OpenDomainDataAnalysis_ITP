		<content> Although traditionally a live-stock   
 rearing area there has been a change  
 to more cereal cultivation - wheat and
 some barley. Some hedges have been    
 removed to make larger fields. This   
 fact and the modern machinery make    
 cereal harvesting much quicker and    
 easier than in the past. Price        
 guarantees to farmers by E.E.C.       
 intervention have also encouraged     
 farmers to grow more cereals.         
   There are fewer farms but they are  
 larger. Many old farmhouses are now   
 private residences with a small       
 paddock or 2 for a pony. Though cereal
 production has increased farms can    
 support as much stock as previously   
 because of increased effciency in     
 grass growing. One local farmer told  
 us that 40 years ago a cow needed 2   
 acres of grazing now only 1 acre is   
 needed.     {D Skan                   </content>
