		<title>07Farming 2: Weather &amp; Soil</title>
		<content>    The climate of this area is        
 difficult for farming and because the 
 farms are on top of the Downs the     
 mist, which contains salt from the    
 sea, blows over the land and scorches 
 the grass. The salt (sodium chloride) 
 reacts with the crops and causes      
 combustion, although if the crops are 
 killed off during the winter, farmers 
 can always plant spring barley. The   
 solution is really to grow crops and  
 rear dairy cattle. If the weather is  
 wet then you can be sure of a good    
 dairy product even if the crops fail. 
    The soil in this area is not ideal 
 for farming. Certain parts of the area
 have only a few inches of topsoil     
 above the chalk; other areas have     
 eight feet of clay on top of the      
 chalk. Throughout the ground is full  
 of flint.
