    The most popular pastime in this   
 area is watching television!On        
 television the favourite programmes   
 are Dallas,Wogan and East Enders. Most
 people watch television in the        
 evening.

 going to pub. The people who went to  
 the pubs the most were the fathers.The
 cinema isn't as popular as it used to 
 be,as everyone is buying or hiring the
 films as they come out on video. In   
 our area there aren't many cinemas,the
 nearest cinema being in Guildford.    
 Sporting activity,although more people
 are turning to it as an alternative to
 staying inside,still isn't very       
 popular at the moment. The most
