 Eridge Old Park lies between Frant    
 village and Eridge.It is a peaceful   
 place and the home of many animals.The
 only things you can hear are the      
 birds,the crunching of leaves under   
 your feet,and sometimes the rushing of
 a small waterfall.There are many very 
 old trees in the park some are over   
 400 years old.Many of the old beech   
 trees have branches grafted together. 
 If you walk very quietly you may see  
 red deer.Following the public footpath
 through the park you will come to two 
 lakes.Beside the smaller lake,fringed 
 with bullrushes ,is a very pleasant   
 spot for a picnic.It looks very       
 picturesque with its small boat house 
 and Canada geese swimming on its      
 surface.Altogether the park makes a   
 perfect place to enjoy the sussex     
 countryside.                          </content>
