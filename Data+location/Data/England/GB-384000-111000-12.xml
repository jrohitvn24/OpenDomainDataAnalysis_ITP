		<title>12SHOPPING IN SHROTON</title>
		<content>   THERE ARE TWO SHOPS IN SHROTON. WE  
 ASKED THE SHOPKEEPERS IN THE{VILLAGE  
{STORES}AND{POST OFFICE}AND FOUND OUT  
 THAT BOTH SHOPS HAD BEEN THERE SINCE  
 BRFORE THE WAR. ONE OF THEM WAS A     
 BAKERY 20 YEARS AGO BUT HAS RECENTLY  
 BEEN TURNED INTO A VILLAGE STORE. THE 
 STORE NOW SELLS DRINKS, SPREADS, EGGS,
 GROCERIES AND PAPERS. THE POST OFFICE 
 GETS ITS GROCERIES FROM THE CASH AND  
 CARRY. THE VILLAGE SHOPS ARE USED BY  
 THE VILLAGERS DURING THE WEEK FOR ODDS
 AND ENDS OR DAILY SHOPPING. THE POST  
 OFFICE IS USEFUL FOR STAMPS AND       
 ELDERLY PEOPLE DRAWING OUT THEIR OLD  
 AGE PENSIONS.                         
   THE MAIN WEEKLY SHOPPING BY THE     
 VILLAGERS IS DONE IN SUPERMARKETS IN  
 BLANDFORD WHICH PROVIDE CHEAPER       
 GROCERIES THAN IN THE VILLAGE. OTHER  
 POPULAR{SHOPPING TOWNS}ARE STURMINSTER
 NEWTON, SHAFTESBURY AND SALISBURY.    </content>
