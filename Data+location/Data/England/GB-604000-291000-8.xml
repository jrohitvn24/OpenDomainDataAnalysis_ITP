		<content> Old Buckenham Cricket team won the    
 Manning Cup 6-a-Side Indoor Cricket   
 competition.  It was a race against   
 time to get that last run to beat     
 their opponents 96 to 95.  Barry      
 Potter set up the victory of the day  
 by scoring 41 runs.  Colin Gibbons,   
 the captain, took the cup with pride  
 from Mrs. Manning of Attleborough.    
                                       
 A gardening business called Muck and  
 Muscle was started by a lady called   
 Mrs. Walsh. It is really organic      
 gardening.  After ending a 25-year    
 teaching career she started growing   
 herbaceous plants, vegetables and     
 herbs.  Mrs. Walsh said "I've got     
 50 different herbs so far and the     
 number is growing all the time."  Mrs.
 Walsh also hopes to grow and sell rare
 marsh plants.  People can also tour   
 her herb garden.                      </content>
