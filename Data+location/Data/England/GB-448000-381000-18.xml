		<title>18THE MINER'S STRIKE</title>
		<content> During the years 1984/1985 there was a
 miner's {strike.} It had a great      
 effect on me and my family, there was 
 no money coming into the house so I   
 had no pocket money.   My mum and my  
 dad had no new clothes but my sister  
 and I did.   Nearly every day my dad  
 went picketing for about three or four
 hours, some mornings he went for      
 longer.   Each week my dad or  mum    
 went to the local club for a {food    
{parcel}in which you got things like   
 tinned beans, a packet of rice and    
 sometimes a bit of meat or sausages.  
 At one point we nearly had a cupboard 
 full of tinned tomatoes.   Every day  
 on the news there were reports of {   
{police}on horses hitting striking     
 miners with their batons and then the 
 pickets throwing stones at policemen. 
 All over the country there was        
 violence between police and {pickets.}</content>
