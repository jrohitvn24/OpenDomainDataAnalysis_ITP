		<title>16Titchfield Carnival Time</title>
		<content> Early November is the time for        
 bonfires and fireworks.Up and down the
 country ,in towns and villages alike. 
 Crowds of people gather in the streets
 ,gardens and open spaces to remember  
 the 5th November.This is Guy Fawlkes  
 Day ,when the bonfires and fireworks  
 recall the unsuccessful attempt by    
 Fawlkes and his accomplices to destroy
 the Houses of Parliament in 1605.In   
 some places the jollifications are    
 planned on an especially big scale and
 one of these is the Hampshire village 
 of Titchfield 10 miles south-east of  
 Southampton.                          
                                       
 Every year on Monday nearest to the   
 5th of November, Titchfield holds a   
 carnival which has flourished for     
 about 90 years one of the best of its 
 kind in the south.The carnival is     
 organised by the Titchfield Bonfireboy</content>
