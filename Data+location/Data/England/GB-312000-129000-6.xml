  Mr Day was good enough to let the two
 teachers accompanying the school party
 look around his house while the       
 childen went off to explore the rest  
 of the farm.                          
                                       
 The farmhouse dates from the 15th     
 century. It is a long, two storey     
 building with stone floors, beautiful 
 plaster ceilings and attractive wooden
 panelling. In one of the rooms, it is 
 believed that the death warrant of    
 King Charles I was drawn up. Many of  
 the ancient timbers in the farmhouse  
 were exposed when the building was    
 redecorated about 20 years ago.
