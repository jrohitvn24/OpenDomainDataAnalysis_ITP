		<title>18OUNDLE MARINA</title>
		<content> The original gravel pit supplied      
 materials for runways on wartime      
 airfields.                            
 In 1963 Mr. J.T.Newington,a business  
 man from Spalding, whose hobby was    
 boating, saw the old pit on the       
 outskirts of Oundle.                  
 To set up the new facility a channel  
 was cut through ten feet of bank to   
 the River Nene and a roadway and      
 carpark were built. The original      
 buildings included a workshop, a      
 chandlery, a boat showroom and winter 
 storage facilities for boats.         
 In May 1964 the Marina was opened,    
 with river cruisers for hire and      
 moorings to let to boat owners.
