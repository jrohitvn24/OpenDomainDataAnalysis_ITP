		<title>02FAMILY LIFE IN TILBURY</title>
		<content> My nan was born in 1928, she lived in 
 Stephenson Avenue until the second    
 world war ended then she moved to     
 Cowper Avenue. My grandad was born in 
 1925, he lived in Parker Avenue until 
 he met my nan. They met in a cafe in  
 Tilbury. When my nan's mum died she   
 left the house to my nan. At the time 
 she was engaged to be married. They   
 married in 1949 when she was 24. Now  
 they both live in Cowper Avenue at    
 number 42. They have eight children,  
 my mum is the second oldest.
