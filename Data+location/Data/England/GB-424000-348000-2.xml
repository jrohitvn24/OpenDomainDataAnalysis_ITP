		<content>  From our questionnaire we discovered 
 that there are more people in         
{professions}than any other occupation,
 even more than the total number of    
{retired}people, which was the         
 second largest group.                 
  After{professions,}the commonest     
 occupation is{office work}followed by 
{factory work, domestic work, sales}and
{transport}all of which were very close
 together.                             
  We expected more people to be        
 employed in{agriculture,}but we found 
 this was the smallest group except for
 those who follow{trades.              
  The majority of people travel out of 
 Kirk Ireton to work. Several people   
 work in{Derby, Matlock, Ashbourne,    
{Wirksworth, Belper, Hulland}and       
{Milford.}A few do work in other places
 and some are travelling all the time.
