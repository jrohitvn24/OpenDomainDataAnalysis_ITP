		<title>15EMPLOYMENT IN EAST SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content>   Many people in east Sheffield work  
 in{factories.}In recent times factory 
 work has been made a lot easier and   
 quicker because of modern machinery.  
   Much of the older heavy industry ,  
 especialy that associated with{steel  
 manufacture, is closed and the windows
 of the empty buildings are smashed by 
 young people with little prospect of  
 employment in the area.               
   Over the last hundred years or so   
 steel making grew into a huge industry
 in the{Don Valley}to serve the demands
 of two world wars and a growing car-  
 owning public.                        
   Now cheap imports from abroad and a 
 lessening demand for steel in all     
 manufactoring industries has led to   
 the closure of many private and{State-
{owned}steel works.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
