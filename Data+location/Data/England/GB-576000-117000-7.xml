 There has been a long tradition of    
 education in Sedlescombe dating back  
 to 1840. The village is now served by 
 a School opened in 1980 which caters  
 for approximately 100 children between
 the ages of 5 and 11. They are        
 organised into four classes. Some     
 children from outlying areas go to    
 other small rural schools.            
                                       
 From the age of 11 most children      
 attend Claverham Community College in 
 Battle, generally travelling there by 
 special school bus.                   
                                       
 Adult classes are held in the village 
 for Keep Fit, Flower Arranging and    
 Art.
