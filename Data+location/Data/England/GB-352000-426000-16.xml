          netball.                     
{SPRING}- skipping,Hide-and-seek,Cops- 
          and-robbers,Jacks,netball.   
{SUMMER}- cricket,running,rounders,    
          Bottle-of-poison,marbles.    
{AUTUMN}- Conkers,football,skipping.   
    We have only a small yard near to  
 our classrooms. So, because windows   
 kept being broken, we now use soft    
 foam balls for our games of football, 
 rounders and cricket.                 
   {Marbles}is our favourite game in   
 these summer months.Bulldog and Bottle
 of-poison are unusual games of tig and
 chase, using the painted lines on our 
 playground as dens and bases. Such    
 games as skipping, 2-ball and football
 we play all the year round.
