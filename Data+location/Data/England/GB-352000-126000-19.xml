		<content>  CARY FITZPAINE is mentioned in the   
 original Domesday Book-'Robert holds  
 Cary(Fitzpaine)from Roger.Two thanes  
 held it before 1066:it paid tax for 1 
 hide,less 1 furlong.Land for one      
 plough which  is there,in lordship,   
 with 4 cottagers. Meadow 20acres.10   
 cattle;9 pigs.The value was,and       
 is,20s.'                              
  This was anciently a manor place of  
 some consequence and it would appear  
 to have had its own chapel of which   
 there are now no traces.It was        
 probably rebuilt early in the         
 19th.century and is an admirable      
 example of local village building with
 its walls of coursed lias rubble and  
 pyramidal slate roof.The deep         
 eaves,the panelled windows with       
 keyblocks and the metal verandah are  
 all typical of the period.It is still 
 the farmhouse of a working farm.      </content>
