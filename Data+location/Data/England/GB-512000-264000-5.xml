		<content>    In general the various houses in   
 the area are well cared for. The old  
 houses in the Town and along the      
 Highway contrast with the Council     
 housing areas of 1930's and 1950's and
 the private housing estate of a       
 hundred houses built in the 1970's.   
 More recently there has been some     
 infilling of newer houses along the   
 Causeway and Highway.                 
    Currently the County Council is    
 undertaking renovation on its older   
 houses, costing several thousand      
 pounds per house. On the Estate       
 replacement windows and cavity        
 insulation have been in vogue in      
 recent years.                         
    We found that most people moving to
 the Estate do so because the houses   
 are reasonably priced in pleasant     
 surroundings....but job mobility here 
 causes a fairly fluid population.     </content>
