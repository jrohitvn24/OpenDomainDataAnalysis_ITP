		<content>  When adults in the block were asked  
 why they came to live here, the       
 following figures emerged:            
     Born In This Area  _  33%         
     Father's Work      _  30%         
     Dislike Of Town Life_ 20%         
     Got Married         _ 12%         
     Larger House        _  5%         
 When asked how the area had changed in
 recent years many people felt that it 
 had changed very little.The pulling   
 down of mill property and the building
 of the Longlands Council Estate plus  
 some new shop development was often   
 mentioned.A more liberal attitude to  
 newcomers was evident although the    
 community was still very closely knit.
     Few people attend Church regularly
 and they are predominantly pensioners.
    About 50% of families with children
 own a freezer,shop at supermarkets and
 use local shops for emergencies only. </content>
