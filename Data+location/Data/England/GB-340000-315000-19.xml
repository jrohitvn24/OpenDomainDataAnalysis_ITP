		<title>19FARM WORKERS LIFE - MONTFORD</title>
		<content>   The work of the farm labourer has   
 changed a lot during the lives of many
 farm workers in this area. They say   
 how much less physical the job has    
 become thanks to the increased use of 
 tractors with lifting gear and other  
 types of mechanisation.  Their hours  
 also tend to be less excessive and    
 more regular.  They still have to work
 long days (inc week-ends) at busy     
 harvest or ploughing times and may be 
 called out all night at short notice  
 during calving.                       
   Increased use of outside contractors
 and consultants makes some workers    
 feel a less integral part of the farm.
 Some also say that the greater use of 
 chemicals and machines - with the     
 associated face masks, helmets and ear
 protectors - makes it more like a     
 factory job at times, and not the     
 healthy outdoor life it used to be.   </content>
