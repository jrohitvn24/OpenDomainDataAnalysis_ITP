		<content>  Start your walk on the beach(585809) 
 where you can see a gift shop,beach   
 huts,{Fisherman's Cottage},the pier   
 and  many people walking about        
 Shanklin.The sea wall is made of many 
 interesting stones.Above the beach is 
{Rylestone Gardens}which has a         
 cafe.Many Shanklin hotels are near    
 these gardens.You can continue your   
 walk on the Luccombe Road where we saw
 the Margaret Passmore Theatre and     
 Upper Chine School.                   
  Opposite the school is a recreation  
 field called Big Meade and close by a 
 14th century church called St.        
 Blasius.Cross over a stile by the     
 church and start your walk through    
 some fields up to a steep cliff and on
 to{Shanklin}Down.From the top,you will
 have a good view of Culver Cliff and  
 Sandown Bay and the surrounding       
 countryside(568802).                  </content>
