		<content>     In the 1870's children attended   
 school irregularly as they had to work
 in the fields. Sometimes they were    
 sent home for uncleanliness Her       
 Majesty's Inspectorate visited        
 rgularly. An outbreak of scarlatina   
 caused the school to close in October 
 1875. Discipline was a problem in     
 1875. The Headteacher wrote:-         
     "The children were more orderly   
 this afternoon and the boys           
 gave greater attention to their       
 lessons, but still there is much      
 difficulty in marking the attendance  
 registers as the children do not know 
 their places. Gave the order that if  
 anyone left the place in which they   
 where seated they should stay behind  
 half an hour. Great self-possesion and
 firmness is necessary with these      
 children."                            
                                       </content>
