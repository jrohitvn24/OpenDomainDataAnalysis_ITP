		<content> The reporters on the Esher News and   
 Mail gave us their impressions  of the
 issues of current concern.They range  
 form quite weighty matters of local   
 concern to the question of the        
 thickness of the black,plastic dustbin
 liners which are issued by the Council
 for residents to put their rubbish in.
 The constant threat to the Green Belt 
 by property developers is a frequent  
 news item.                            
 Perennial issues include complaints   
 about the noise nuisance of overhead  
 aeroplane and helicopter routes,the   
 existence of unofficial gypsy         
 campsites and the increasing build up 
 of traffic hroughout the area and the 
 attendant parking problems.           
 Another cause of recent concern is the
 shake-up of education and the closures
 and mergers of local schools.
