We interviewed 181 people from 18      
streets near Wicksteed Park to find    
their views on the great park of       
Kettering. 11 visited every day, 16    
never went, mostly because they were   
too old and 154 visited quite often.30 
times a year was the average           
visit.People took dogs for walks, went 
for picnics, to enjoy the peace and    
quiet in some parts of the park and to 
take children and grandchildren on the 
amusements. Charles Wicksteed meant the
Park to be free for the Kettering      
townsfolk. We asked people what they   
thought about paying for amusements.   
The elderly were Â£annoyed, disgusted   
and angry' and thought it was a Â£con'. 
"I preferred it the old way when we    
didn't have to pay at all," said an old
man. Younger people thought charges    
were  reasonable. Parking is free.     </content>
