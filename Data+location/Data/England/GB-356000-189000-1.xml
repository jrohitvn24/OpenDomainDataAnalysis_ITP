		<title>01Introduction to the area</title>
		<content> About half this D-Block comprises the 
 River Severn.The land bordering the   
 Severn has been drained and is now    
 used for animal grazing.While most of 
 the land is low-lying interspersed are
 areas of higher land which afford     
 marvellous views of the Severn,       
 surrounding countryside and Gwent     
 coastline. Farms are scattered        
 throughout the area and engage in both
 crop growing and pastoral farming.    
              Two villages, Aust and   
 Littleton-on-Severn occupy the        
 south-west and south-east corners     
 respectively. Aust is dominated by the
 Severn Road Bridge and the Motorway   
 Service Area at Aust Cliff which      
 contrasts with the tranquility of the 
 main part of the village.             
 Littleton-on-Severn is so quiet it    
 could easily be missed by the         
 uobservant visitor.                   </content>
