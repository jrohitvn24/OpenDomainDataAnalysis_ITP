		<content> The tourist industry in this area has 
 increased a great deal in recent      
 years. There are four hotels, two inns
 and sixteen houses doing bed and      
 breakfast. The average cost for an    
 overnight stay at a hotel is Â£13.00 or
 Â£10.00 at a B &amp; B. Altogether there is
 room for 181 guests in Campden. Most  
 of the foreign visitors are American  
 and interviews suggest that they visit
 because they have heard that it is a  
 beautiful town. On average, they stay 
 for a week during which time they tour
 the Cotswolds and visit Stratford. In 
 Campden the church of St James has a  
 splendid exterior but a rather dull   
 interior. Outside is the ruin of      
 Campden House burnt in the Civil War  
 and opposite are the Almshouses built 
 by Sir Baptist Hicks who  built the   
 Market Hall.The High Street contains  
 the most beautiful buildings of all.  </content>
