		<content>   To find out what people thought of  
 Stanford we conducted a survey on the 
 entertainment, shopping facilities,   
 medical facilities and public         
 transport.On the whole, most people   
 thought that Stanford was a reasonable
 place to live, although everyone      
 complained about the lack of          
 entertainment.Most people thought that
 there could be a greater variety of   
 shops and an improvement in the ones  
 we have.The younger age group did not 
 comment on the medical facilities,    
 although the older age group stressed 
 that there could be some improvement. 
 The O.A.P.s that we talked to         
 complained about the lack of bus      
 services.Generally, we found that     
 everyone wanted more entertainment,   
 the most popular suggestion being a   
 cinema, and that Stanford is a clean  
 and safe place to live.               </content>
