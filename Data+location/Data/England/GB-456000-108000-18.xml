		<title>18HEALTH IN NORTH FAREHAM</title>
		<content> One repeated cause for concern from   
 our interviews was the lack of health 
 care in Funtley and N.Fareham,however 
 this seems to be unfounded.There is a 
 health centre with anti-natal clinic  
 and a nurse in constant attendance in 
 Fareham and a smaller clinic in       
 Wickham,both of these within 3        
 kilometres of the north Fareham block.
 Health visitors and midwives operate  
 from both clinics and cover the area  
 comprehensively.There is a major      
 hospital,with full emergency and      
 accident facilities,only 10km away on 
 the outskirts of Portsmouth.Knowle    
 Hospital is a psychiatric hospital    
 only,taking it's patients from a wide 
 area of southern England,but it has no
 accident or emergency department.
