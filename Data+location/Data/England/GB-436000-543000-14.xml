		<title>14*** BUSINESS IS BOOMING **</title>
		<content> Some of us talked to Mr Metherall who 
 works at G. Murray Auctioneer's       
 Office.Mr Murray told us that he      
 values houses and farms for sale but  
 that he likes auctioneering the       
 best.When he was a boy he used to go  
 to the mart.They sold cows, sheep,    
 pigs and horses.He said that things   
 have changed now.I think he likes the 
 old times best.Animals used to come by
 train but there is no station now.It  
 was closed in the 1950's. All Murray's
 business was centred around the       
 mart.They charge money for everything 
 they sell.It is called commission.They
 also charge commission for selling    
 property.When people come to the mart 
 they sometimes go to the shops so the 
 shopkeepers are pleased. Murray's is  
 one of the oldest businesses in       
 Haswell.Mr.Metherall says they do     
 quite well.                           </content>
