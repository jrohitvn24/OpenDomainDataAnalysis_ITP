 units. We have a wide selection of    
 retail outlets including a dairy,     
 hairdressers,turf accountant,food     
 shops,furniture shops,cafes and public
 houses. There are three garages       
 selling petrol,two of which sell      
 second-hand cars. Salesmen of tax free
 cars for export come to the village on
 a regular basis. There is one bank    
 which provides a full banking service.
 These premises are situated in the    
 centre of the village and along the   
 A338 going north and on the Zouch
