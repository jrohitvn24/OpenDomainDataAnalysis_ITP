		<content> Since 1982, the town of Marlborough   
 has had a link with the village of    
 Gunjur in the Gambia, West Africa and 
 so far three generations have stayed  
 in Marlborough.                       
 Since it is a link of friendship, and 
 not one of aid, when the people of    
 Gunjur asked for financial help in    
 building a new classroom block for    
 the local school, help was immediately
 at hand.                              
 Fund raising began in early 1985 to   
 raise the Â£14,000 required.  Noteable 
 contributions of fund raising         
 organisation have come from Preshute  
 Primary School, the Wiltshire Police  
 Constabulary, local Political parties 
 and Britsh Rail.                      
 It is hoped that the target will be   
 met by 1986 and preparations for      
 visits by young people of Marlborough 
 to Gunjur are being made.             </content>
