   The{original school}was built of    
 limestone in{1849.}A wooden partition 
 divides this building into two        
 classrooms.                           
   Attached to this building is a      
 house in which previous headmasters   
 used to live.                         
   In{1958}a{second block was built    
 comprising one classroom and a        
 kitchen,so all the school meals are   
 cooked on the premises.               
   Two years ago the school was        
{threatened with closure,}but the      
{villagers fought and won the case}so  
 the school remains open.              
   This term there are{34 pupils,}a    
 headmistress and one teacher.         
   There is a lot of grassland around  
 the school and we have a large playing
 field for{football}etc. and a yard for
{skittle ball.                         </content>
