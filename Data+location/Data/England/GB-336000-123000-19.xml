		<content> I get up at 7.15 am. I get dressed and
 make my bed and go downstairs and lay 
 the table. After breakfast I do the   
 washing up. I walk to school. We have 
 assembly at 9.00. At 10.40 we have our
 first break which ends at 10.55. After
 Mathematics before break, we have     
 English afterwards. At 12.10 we have  
 dinner break. If it is wet we have    
 sandwiches inside and we have to wait 
 to get in the hall. If it is dry we   
 have sandwiches outside.In the        
 afternoon we do all sorts of things.  
 On Mondays we have Games, on Tuesdays 
 we have Art and Craft and on Fridays  
 we work on our topics.We have swimming
 after last break and we go in the pool
 in two groups because there are 34 of 
 us in the class. At 2.30 we have our  
 afternoon break and school ends at    
 3.15. At home I have a hot meal, watch
 T.V., and go to bed at 9.00 pm.       </content>
