		<title>18A Striking family</title>
		<content>  I can remember when my dad went on   
 strike. I was walking to school and he
 was walking home from the pit.He said,
 "We are going on strike."At that      
 moment I didn't really take it        
 serious.                              
  My dad knew this was his last wage so
 he went to the D.H.S.S. to get a      
 benefit.We were allowed Â£20.30 to live
 on Â£3.60 of which was for my special  
 diabetic diet.My parents were in debt 
 having to pay bills in small amounts. 
 My mum worried about being able to pay
 the dinner.Of course we were helped by
 the family,vouchers from the union and
 the church.My dad got a decent meal   
 provided by the Women's Action group  
 and I was allowed free school dinners.
  Apart from some difficult times our  
 family managed quite well through the 
 strike.{* by Karen Dawson *
