 How to play Ball Tag:-You need three  
 or more people and a light plastic    
 football. In this example I will use  
 four people. One person is on; this   
 means that one person chases the other
 three. He will try and throw the      
 football at the other three , if he   
 hits one of the other players then    
 that player becomes the thrower.      
 The most popular game played by boys  
 of 9 and 10 is Football, followed by  
 Bulldogs, Tag, Pinball, and Conkers   
 (in season).                          
 Home games (Ball Tag, Football,       
 Monopoly, Army, Cards, Darts, Snooker,
 Tennis, Chess, Cricket, Rebound,      
 50:50, Stuck-in-the-mud, Conkers).    
 Monopoly is the most common game for  
 boys to play at home.                 </content>
