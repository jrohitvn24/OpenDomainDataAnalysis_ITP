HARVEST SUPPER                         
After harvest time there was a Harvest 
Supper in the village hall.  For food  
there were salads and jacket potatoes  
and bread rolls on a long table.  It   
was a buffet supper.  When all the     
food had gone the tables were cleared  
and put away then the people could get 
up and dance.  After we had danced we  
had a magician and a dancer who came   
out of a pretend house on the stage.   
MINI-MARATHON                          
In 1985 somebody had the idea of doing 
a mini-marathon to raise money for the 
Community Council and so, sponsored    
by the Mendlesham Bakery, it was held  
on Sunday 19th May.  Everybody lined   
up at the start on the playing field   
and when the man fired the gun they    
started the race.  There were 172      
sponsored runners.                     </content>
