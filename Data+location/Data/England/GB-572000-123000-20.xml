		<content>    With the building of the By-pass   
 and the electrification of the railway
 line the future of this area is       
 bright.                               
  Many more people are likely to move  
 into the region and industry could be 
 persuaded to set-up in and around the 
 village.                              
  Religion will still play a major part
 in the life-style of the village.     
  It is thought that the population    
 will increase sharply mainly along the
 line of the By-pass.                  
  Although all these changes may occur 
 it is hoped that the customs          
 of village life will not be lost.
