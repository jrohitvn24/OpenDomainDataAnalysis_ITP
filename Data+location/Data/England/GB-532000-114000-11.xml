		<title>11Law and Order in Ditchling</title>
		<content> The Ditchling Village 'Bobby' lives in
 the village and is also responsible   
 for the hamlets of Streat and         
 Westmeston.Lewes is the Sub_Divisional
 H.Q.and the Ditchling policeman covers
 the Wivelsfield policeman and vice_   
 versa.Ditchling was one of the first  
 villages in the area to join the Crime
 Alert scheme which was set up in l984 
 to help the police in the detection of
 crime.Residents keep an eye on neigh_ 
 bours' property,take note of cars or  
 people behaving in a suspicious manner
 and feed relevant information back to 
 the police,who in their turn inform   
 the public of missing cars or of any  
 undesirables known to be in the area. 
 The number of burglaries in Ditchling 
 has dropped significantly but this    
 could be coincidence. Streat is plann_
 ing to set up a similar scheme.
