		<title>15N. Baddersley Gospel Church</title>
		<content> The church is built out of house      
 bricks and looks like a sports hall   
 and not a church. There has been a    
 church in North Baddersley's Nutburn  
 Rd for 98 years, although the original
 church was only a wooden building. It 
 was expanded backwards from the road  
 25 years ago and has been widened for 
 a year. Inside the church has a video 
 camera and all the equipment needed to
 go with it including large television 
 screens in the adjoining room, to show
 services to those who cannot seeit    
 from the main room. Pastor Ron White  
 is the man 'in control' and there is  
 also an evangalist called Dave Deeney.
 About 250 people attend the services  
 on Sunday and the different activities
 during the week draw a good attendence
 as well.Songs during services are     
 aided by drums, trumpets, and electric
 organ, unlike traditional services.   </content>
