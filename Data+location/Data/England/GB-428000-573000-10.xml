		<content> The 'Trade' group have been studying  
 the shops in Seaton Delaval. Many{    
{shops}in our town are owned by        
 families who have lived here for many 
 years. For example, a local           
 newsagents, Hartshornes, has been a   
 newsagents for about 70 years and was 
 a boot shop before that. There is a   
 large Co-op where most people do their
 weekly shopping and get their daily   
 stock. We have also been collecting{  
{labels}from tins etc. to see where the
 food eaten in Seaton Delaval comes    
 from. We found that most of our food  
 comes from the UK.We did a survey of  
 the{commercial traffic}that goes past 
 our school and found that most of it  
 was leaving Seaton Delaval. We found a
 great deal of information about trade 
 by sending a questionnaire to every   
 shop in the town.
