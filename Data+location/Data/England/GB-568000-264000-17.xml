		<content>Many of the houses in Kentford are     
about 100 years old, although there is 
a small modern estate called Moulton   
Avenue. Many of the houses are quite   
big and would sell at about            
45,000 pounds.                         
Lots of the houses in Moulton are      
modern and there is quite a big        
estate, although the centre of the     
village is much older.                 
Between Gazeley School and the church  
there are private bungalows that sell  
at about 40,000 pounds. The atmosphere 
is very quiet and bungalows are the    
most popular type of house in the area.
The most unusual house is the renovated
Gazeley windmill.                      
As the underlying rock is chalk there  
is a plentiful supply of flint and this
was the building material used         
throughout the area when many of the   
older houses were built.               </content>
