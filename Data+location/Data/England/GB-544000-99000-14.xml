		<title>14NEWHAVEN BUILDINGS FROM 1868</title>
		<content> Fort Newhaven was built in 1868.      
 Covering ten acres it has underground 
 passages, gun emplacements, a dry moat
 and a central parade ground with      
 perimeter casemates, each originally  
 housing sixteen men.  Used during both
 World Wars, two new tunnels were dug  
 through to the beach in the Second    
 World War, to prevent invasion.       
 Neglected for years, the fort was     
 restored and opened as a tourist      
 attraction in 1983.                   
 Denton Island was created in the      
 nineteenth century when the river was 
 straightened.  The modern swing bridge
 carrying the A259 over the Ouse was   
 constructed in 1974.  Modern buildings
 in Newhaven include the shopping      
 precinct, swimming pool and police    
 station.  The latter is constructed   
 round an internal courtyard, intended 
 as a prisoners' exercise yard.        </content>
