		<title>07PUBLIC HOUSES, BURSTON AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
The only amenities in this area for    
relaxation are the two Public Houses.  
The first, The Red Lion, is on the     
B5027 road near the village of         
Milwich.  At first sight it is easily  
mistaken for a farm and visitors have  
trouble finding the way in. It is very 
quiet and uncommercialised and used    
almost entirely by local people. Its   
facilities are basic with tiled floors,
wooden chairs and an open fire.        
                                       
The Greyhound, just off the A5l, in    
Burston itself, is well signposted     
and unmistakably a Public House. It is 
popular with people from a wide area   
including Stone and tourists from the  
canal, who go to eat and drink in      
comfortable surroundings and a friendly
atmosphere.
