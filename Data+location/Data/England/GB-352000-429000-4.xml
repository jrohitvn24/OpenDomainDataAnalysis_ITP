		<content>        I am Tahera Patel. Tahera means
 clean.                                
        I was born in England but my   
 parents were born in India. My father 
 was born in Kantharia and my mother in
 Nandewar. These are two small villages
 near Baruch. I go to Deepdale Junior  
 School to learn English but at home I 
 speak Gujarati. After school I go to  
 Qu-watul-Islam mosque. I wear a       
 burkha in the mosque. This is a white 
 cloth which covers me from head to    
 foot with only my face showing. We    
 have to pray at home after the mosque.
 June this year is the holy month of   
 Ramadam and we are now fasting. After 
 Ramadam it is our Eid festival. We are
 all looking forward to Eid.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
