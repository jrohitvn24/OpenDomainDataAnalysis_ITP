		<content>  Ickford is a small peaceful village. 
 Most children like the playing field  
 best.It has a climbing frame,a sand-  
 pit and  swing.There are some logs    
 you can walk on.There is a new seesaw 
 and a football pitch.                 
  There is one main shop that sells    
 food,sweets and household things.Mrs  
 Barton runs the shop with help from   
 other people.There is another shop    
 called Langon London Ltd. that sells  
 garden things.                        
  There is a small church which is     
 very interesting to look at.We have a 
 new vicar Rev Andrew De Puray.The     
 church is called St. Nicholas.        
  The village hall we have was built by
 local carpenters and it was opened on 
 the 16th of September 1950 after 1 and
 a half years of work.You can hire the 
 hall for parties,discos etc. It is    
 nice to have a hall in the village.   </content>
