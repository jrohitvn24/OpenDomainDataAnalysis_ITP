  Sheepwash Farm is in the village of  
Slitting Mill. It is mostly grassland  
except for one field of barley.        
There are 36 {milking cows,} and 30    
other cattle aged from two weeks to    
two years old. The herd is specially   
tested.                                
  The milk is delivered by the farmer  
and his wife because the milk does not 
go to a dairy. It is untreated milk    
which means it is not pasteurised.     
They have got about 250 customers.     
The cows give about 120 gallons per    
day.                                   
  The farm is 90 acres, 10 acres       
of which are rented from another       
farmer.                                
  45 years ago the farm was owned by   
the Marquis of Anglesey.
