		<title>19AN OLD HOUSE</title>
		<content> The house itself was apparently       
 divided into three dwellings and it   
 has three front and three rear doors  
 and seven seperate fireplaces.        
 Renovation works carried out since the
 purchase have revealed that although  
 much of the interior timberwork-the   
 ceiling beams and the big inglenook   
 for example are certainly mid to late 
 Tudor it is probable that the original
 structure of the house is possibly    
 late Saxon.As such it was almost      
 certainly a open-hall type house with 
 an upstairs stocar at the south end   
 only,where there is a stone fireplace 
 in the main front bedroom.At the north
 end there was originally not an       
 inglenook but merely a smoke-bay.The  
 main timbers here are extensively     
 blackened and slightly charred under  
 the gable.                            
                                       </content>
