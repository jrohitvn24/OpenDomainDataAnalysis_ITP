      {by Lucy Sabin.}                 
 In September our family started the   
{Cotswold Way}Walk.We met at the Red   
 Lion and drove to{Moreton,}where we   
 continued by minibus to our finishing 
 point of last time.Most of the walks  
 were about nine miles long.We saw     
{Broadway Tower},{The Somerset}        
{Monument},{Severn Bridge}and{River},  
 and{The Black Mountains of Wales}on   
 our way.Sometimes we had to wear      
 oilskins but I didn't like this as it 
 was sweaty.We usually ate our packed  
 lunch in a pub garden.The signs along 
 the route were good and they were     
 marked with a{white dot}.On the last  
 walk, which was in April, we stayed   
 the night in a Youth Hostel in{Bath}  
 and it was great fun.Throughout the   
 journey we had counted one hundred and
 twelve stiles.                        </content>
