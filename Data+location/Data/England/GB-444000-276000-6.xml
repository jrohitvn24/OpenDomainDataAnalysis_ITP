		<title>06LONG LAWFORD IV</title>
		<content> Occupations                           
                                       
  The majority of the working          
 residents work in the industrial      
 estate in Rugby.There are alternative 
 sources of income in the town centre. 
    Long Lawford itself has little to  
 offer in the way of employment, aside 
 from teaching and serving in the local
 shops and pubs.                       
    Work can also be found in the      
 sewage or cement works on the         
 outskirts of Long Lawford or obviously
 on one of the many farms surrounding  
 the village.                          
    Although this does not sound like  
 much, many of the occupants are Old   
 Aged Pensioners, housewives and       
 children.Therefore, apart from the    
 inevitable out of work factor, the    
 available jobs are adequate.
