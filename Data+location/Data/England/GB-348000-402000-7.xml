		<content>   The current unemployment rate in the
Digmoor area is about 40%, far in      
excess of the National average.        
   The lack of job opportunities in the
area has contributed significantly to  
the depressed state of the town.       
   People have moved away leaving their
houses to be vandalised and there is no
incentive for newcomers to settle in   
the area.                              
   A whole generation is growing up,   
not knowing what it is like to have a  
father in employment.                  
   Any job opportunities which do arise
seem to be in the smaller factory units
   There also seems to be more job     
openings in the area for women than for
men.                                   
   The Rural picture is quite the      
reverse with the ex-farm labourers     
and ex-miners cottages being bought and
modernised by those in employment.     </content>
