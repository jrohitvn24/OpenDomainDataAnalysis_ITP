		<content>    The people we talked to mentioned a
 number of changes. One of the biggest 
 was the growth of the village, in 1947
 there were only 8 houses in Bomere    
 Heath. It now has a{population}of     
 approx. 2500. The most recent         
 development is the{Grove Estate. }    
                                       
    With an increase in size, some     
 people who had lived here a long time 
 thought that the newcomers were less  
 friendly. An increase in size has led 
 to an increase in vandalism &amp; noise,  
 particularly from motor bikes. However
 not all the changes have been adverse.
 Some people said that the increase in 
 size has led to{improved facilities.} 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
