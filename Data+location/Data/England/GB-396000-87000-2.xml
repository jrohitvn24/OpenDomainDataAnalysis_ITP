   The manor of Arne was originally    
 in the possession of Shaftesbury Abbey
 from 948 AD. In Tudor times it passed 
 to George Pitt.                       
   The main value of the area came from
 the saltings originally and later the 
 deposits of ball clay, apart from     
 farming and some smuggling.           
   Thomas Hyde, an important Poole     
 merchent, obtained ball clay mining   
 rights in the 18th century,built a    
 manor house and then went bankrupt in 
 1792.                                 
   In the 19th century the population  
 of Arne was much greater than now,    
 being 80 men of which 17 were         
 agricultural labourers in 1841.       
   Arne was completely evacuated during
 World War Two when it was used as a   
 military training ground. The Nature  
 Reserve was set up in 1965.           </content>
