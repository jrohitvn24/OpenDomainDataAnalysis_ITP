		<content>   Over the past few years{Westminster 
{Rd.}has changed a lot. There used to  
 be a fire station and a police station
 which served the local community. Now 
 they have been closed down and moved a
 long way away. The buildings, which   
 are over 100yrs. old, are occupied by 
 workshops and a double glazing firm.  
 We don't have a local police station  
 or fire station any more. All the old 
{Victorian}terraced houses were knocked
 down last year. We went to see the big
 yellow bulldozers picking up mud and  
 digging the foundations. Now there is 
 a new{housing}estate and we have new  
 children in our school.{(Sarah
