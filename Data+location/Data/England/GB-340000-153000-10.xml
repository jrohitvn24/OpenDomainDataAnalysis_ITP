		<title>10AXBRIDGE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Outside{Axbridge Church}there is a set
 of steps which have been there for    
 many years. At the bottom of the steps
 are two small wells which used to be  
 the main village water supply. The    
 wells are not now used but are still  
 in good condition considering their   
 age. When walking into the church you 
 see the huge{Norman stone arches}which
 make the church seem bigger. The      
 wooden pews are carved at each end.   
{The font}was made of stone in 1450.   
 There is an example of plasterwork    
 dating from  1636. The plastering of  
 medieval{church roofs}developed during
 the late 16th century.In the early    
 17th century the patterning of the    
 etchings became very elaborate.The    
 church is mainly 15th century with a  
 tower containing six bells.
