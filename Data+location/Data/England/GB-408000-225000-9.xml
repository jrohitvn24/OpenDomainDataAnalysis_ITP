		<content> Temple Guiting School was opened in   
 1873 following the Forster's Education
 Act of 1870. It is now 112 years old. 
 It is built of Cotswold stone and has 
 had a new roof recently. In 1947 a    
 kitchen extension was built and meals 
 are still cooked on the premises. In  
 the 1950's the old earth closet       
 toilets were modernised and in the    
 1960's the  old coke stoves were      
 removed and replaced by electricity   
 night store heaters. The windows are  
 very high so that the children are not
 distracted by thing s outside.        
 The first headteacher was Miss Mary   
 Drury, followed by Edward Phillips.   
 Mr. Iain Rushin, the present          
 headteacher is the 16th since the     
 school began. There are 36 children in
 school at the moment and they learn   
 Language,Maths,Science,Art and Craft, 
 History,Games,Music etc.              </content>
