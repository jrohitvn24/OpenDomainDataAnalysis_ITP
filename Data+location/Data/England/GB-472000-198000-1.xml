The villages of Aston Rowant,Kingston  
Blount,Crowell and Chinnor lie along   
the base of the Chiltern Escarpment,   
bounded by the Upper and Lower         
Icknield Ways.The land surrounding     
these vilages is agricultural but      
mechanisation has greatly reduced the  
number of people involved. The         
villages are no longer inhabited by    
those earning their living from the    
land and allied trades.The motorway    
enables those working in London and    
other nearby industrial areas to live  
in these villages. The pace of         
life,compared with the towns,is slower 
and lacks anonimity but the community  
is no longer drawn together by common  
necessity or achieveme.The rural       
environment is so attractive that the  
communities,especially in Chinnor      
continue to expand.                    </content>
