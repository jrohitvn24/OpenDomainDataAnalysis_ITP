		<title>05STYDD HALL AND CHAPEL RUINS</title>
		<content>    One day we went for a walk down the
 fields to Stydd.  Stydd was built in  
 the twelfth century. There is the     
 ruins of a chapel at Stydd. It used to
 be called St. Mary and St. John the   
 Baptist.  It was a Benedictine        
 hermitage. It was given to the        
 Knights Hospitallers and became a     
 Preceptory.  Only one wall of the     
 chapel is left.  Next to the chapel   
 there are old tomb stones.  Knights   
 were buried inside them.  There is an 
 old font next to the chapel as well.  
    Next to the ruins is Stydd Hall.   
 This was an Elizabethan mansion. It is
 still occupied as a farmhouse. It is  
 in need of restoration and repair.    
    Stydd used to be a separate        
 Township but now it is just the ruins,
 the Hall and farm.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
