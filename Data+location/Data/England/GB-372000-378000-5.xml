		<title>05KNUTSFORD INFORMATION CENTRE</title>
		<content>  About five hundred people visit the  
 information centre each week in peak  
 season.  They come to the information 
 centre for various reasons.  Tourists 
 generally ask for accommodation and   
 directions, whereas the citizens of   
 Knutsford generally ask for advice on 
 things such as blocked drains.  More  
 tourists come to the town when special
 events take place such as the         
 Knutsford Royal May Day and the       
 Cheshire Show. They are also very     
 interested in Historic Knutsford as   
 many famous people have been connected
 with the town. Some examples of these 
 people are Elizabeth Gaskell,         
 Highwayman Higgins and Richard Harding
 Watt whose architecture can still be  
 seen in parts of Knutsford. Americans,
 Canadians, French, German and English 
 are just some of the people who go to 
 the information centre each week.     </content>
