		<title>09Old People in Banbury</title>
		<content>Banbury has two Day Centres for old    
people.We visited one in Britannia Road
- our old infant school. Old people go 
to Day Centres to make new friends.    
They can enjoy each others' company and
play games like dominoes,cards and     
scrabble. Sometimes they go on outings.
They have been on two recently - one to
Warwick and one to Leamington Spa. They
have a coffee morning every so often   
and a pianist comes each Wednesday and 
they sing along with the piano. The    
centre is open five days a week,but    
you are only allowed to go twice. The  
average age is about 80-85. They can   
have a meal for 50p- meat, vegetables, 
potatoes and a   pudding. There is     
also a trolley where they can buy food 
such as sweets,tinned food,biscuits    
and toiletry items.
