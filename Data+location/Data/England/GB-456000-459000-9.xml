		<title>09ROSECROFT FARM</title>
		<content> The area is low-lying and level, with 
 about 70% arable land and the rest    
 pasture land. Crops grown include     
 barley and sugar beet.                
 The fields are bordered by hawthorn   
 hedges and drained into deep ditches  
 which have become very overgrown.     
 There is a large variety of plants    
 growing in and around the ditches,    
 including nettles, cow parsley,       
 rosebay willowherb, convulvulous and  
 poppy. Many of the ditches have small 
 trees growing in them, and some of the
 hedges have large trees growing in    
 them. These include sycamore, elm,    
 beech, oak, ash and silver birch.     
 A tarmac local traffic road called    
 Bull Lane runs from the south-east    
 corner of the area in a diagonal      
 direction. Rosecroft Farm is situated 
 to the east of the road in the        
 north-east corner of the area.        </content>
