		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> We used to have two house cows, they  
 were jersey cows, but their milk was  
 too rich and creamy and we didn't like
 it. The farmers wife used to make us  
 butter at the weekends and we had     
 cream too. It took a long time to     
 bring the cows in and milk them by    
 hand twice a day and my father decided
 it was uneconomical and he sold them. 
 We used to keep two pigs called Pinky 
 and Perky to drink the wey milk but   
 when the cows were sold they were sold
 too. Now we buy our milk in           
 Wiveliscombe every day on our way to  
 or from school.                       
 My mother makes bread sometimes, when 
 she doesn't we buy it from the shops  
 and deep freeze it. In the summer we  
 go down to a fruit farm where we can  
 pick strawberries and raspberries and 
 then we make ice creama and jams with 
 them.                                 </content>
