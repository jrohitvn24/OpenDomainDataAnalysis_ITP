<title>21Schools in the area</title>
<content>Of the four schools that were in this area in 1986, three are still in operation. Dormie House closed in the late 80s. Calday Grange Grammar School, originally a school for boys only, began admitting girls to the sixth form in 1985, and now almost half of the 16-18 year old pupils are girls. In the early 90s, Calday became a grant maintained school, and in 2009 was established as a trust school. In 1986, contributers to the Domesday project noted that our area still used the 11+ to select children's secondary education. Twenty five years later, this remains the case.&lt;br />
