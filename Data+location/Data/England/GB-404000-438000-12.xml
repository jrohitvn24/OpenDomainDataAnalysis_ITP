		<title>12LIVING IN A CARAVAN</title>
		<content>   Close to Oakworth Station there is a
{caravan site,}called Worth Valley     
 Caravan Site.  The caravans are used  
 by people who come on{holiday}to visit
{Haworth}and by people who come to the 
 caravan site because their houses are 
 being{renovated.} Many people moving  
 into Oakworth buy{old barns or farms }
 to renovate and live in.  When I moved
 into Oakworth, my family and I moved  
 into a caravan.  There are twelve     
 caravans on the site and one is used  
 as a shower room.  It was quite a     
 squash living in a caravan, and when  
 it rained it was boring.  We crayoned 
 and played games like Hangman or      
 Snakes and Ladders because there was  
 no room to run about.  There was only 
 a small cooker and we ate lots of easy
 meals like spaghetti rings and fish   
 and chips from the "chippy".  I am    
 glad to be living in a house again!   </content>
