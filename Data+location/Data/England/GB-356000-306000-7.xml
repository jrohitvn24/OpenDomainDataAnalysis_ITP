		<content> The houses are varied being of all    
 ages from half timbered houses of up  
 to 500 years old to modern detatched  
 houses. In the two villages of Eaton  
 Constantine and Wroxeter there are    
 small groups of council houses which  
 are semi detatched and have three     
 bedrooms. The modern houses have been 
 built on individual plots and are     
 mostly four bedroomed expensive       
 houses.                               
  Some of the houses that are away from
 the villages are country cottages that
 have been modernised and extended.    
 they were probably farm workers       
 cottages once but have been bought for
 their peaceful surroundings and       
 beautiful views.                      
  All the houses we saw were in good   
 condition and well cared for.
