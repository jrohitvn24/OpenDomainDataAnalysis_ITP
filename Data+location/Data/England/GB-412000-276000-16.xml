		<title>16A Typical Sunday in Solihull</title>
		<content> I usually get up at about 10.00am. Dad
 is out playing golf and my brother is 
 playing snooker. I take the dog out   
 for a run with my friend Jane. After  
 that I usually do any homework that is
 left over from the week.              
 Mum cooks the lunch for about         
 2.00pm.Sometimes I help her with the  
 washing up and then watch a bit of    
 T.V. If it is a nice day I go outside 
 and sunbathe or do some gardening. If 
 there's nothing else to do I go down  
 the road to my friend's house and we  
 watch T.V. or cook or just talk.      
 At about 6.00pm we have our tea. This 
 is usually a sandwich or something on 
 toast. Mum and dad do the washing up  
 and I make a cup of tea or coffee. My 
 brother is very lazy and does not do  
 anything. After tea I have a bath and 
 watch T.V.                            
 I go to bed about 10.15pm.            </content>
