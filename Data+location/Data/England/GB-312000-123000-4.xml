		<title>04THE PARISH CHURCH, OAKE</title>
		<content>      THE PARISH CHURCH AT OAKE IS     
 CALLED ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S. IT IS MADE  
 OF SANDSTONE. THE STONE IS A PINKY    
 BROWN COLOUR LIKE MILVERTON CHURCH AND
 COMES FROM A QUARRY NEAR WIVELISCOMBE.
                                       
      THE CHURCH HAS A LITTLE GRAVE    
 YARD AROUND IT, FULL OF GRASS AND     
 FLOWERS. THERE IS A YOUNG OAK TREE    
 WHICH OAKE SCHOOL PLANTED IN          
 CELEBRATION OF THE SCHOOL BIRTHDAY,   
 WHEN THE SCHOOL WAS 100 YEARS OLD IN  
 1979. THE CHURCH IN OAKE IS DIFFERENT 
 FROM MILVERTON BECAUSE IT IS MUCH     
 SMALLER. ALSO, THE TOWER IS SHORTER.  
 THE CHURCH HAS NOT VERY MANY PEWS, AND
 THE WALLS ARE PAINTED WHITE. THE      
 WINDOWS ARE ALSO DIFFERENT BECAUSE    
 THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY COLOUR.          
                                       
      OAKE CHURCH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF  
 THE COUNTRYSIDE, A LONG WAY FROM OAKE.</content>
