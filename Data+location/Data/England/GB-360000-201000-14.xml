		<content>    Lydney Park, the home of Viscount  
 Bledisloe, covers a large area of     
 woods and fields on the western edge  
 of Lydney. It is open to the public on
 certain days and contains a deer park 
 in which visitors may picnic.         
    Many people go to see the beautiful
 gardens, particularly the displays of 
 rhododendrons and azaleas in Spring.  
    By about 300 AD the Romans had     
 built a Hospitium and Bath-house in   
 the camp there and a Temple to the    
 local god Nodens was added in 364 AD. 
 This is one of the most important     
 Roman discoveries in Britain.         
    One of the boys in my class at     
 school found some Roman coins near    
 there. He handed them over to be kept 
 in the small museum at the Park which 
 also contains other relics found      
 during excavations at the camp.
