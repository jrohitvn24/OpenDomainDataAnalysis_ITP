		<content> The{crime rate}in Moseley is very high
 as it accounts for{25%}of the total   
 crimes reported to Kings Heath police 
 station.The reason for there being so 
 many burglaries in Moseley is that    
 there are many insecure flats where   
 students live,and are out for most of 
 the day so it is easy to break into   
 them.Another very common crime is the 
 stealing or breaking in of cars.The   
 age group that is most involved in    
 crime are the{16_25 year olds.}People 
 are driven to crime mainly because of 
 the lack of money,unemployment, and   
 boredom.The crime rate is now         
 increasing.                           
  Due to high crime rate some house    
 holders have set up{home schemes      
 designed to watch out for crime, and  
 if necessary to contact the police.   
 Sometimes householders have been      
 forced to act before the police.      </content>
