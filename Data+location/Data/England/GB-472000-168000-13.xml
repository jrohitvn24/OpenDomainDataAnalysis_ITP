		<title>13EGG PACKING &amp; DISTRIBUTION</title>
		<content> The Curwin Egg Packing Station has    
 been in operation for about 20 years. 
 720,000 eggs per day arrive at the    
 station.All the eggs which are        
 delivered to the station are          
 redistributed to the retailers on the 
 same day so that they reach the       
 customers while they are still fresh. 
 To ensure that the eggs remain fresh  
 whilst at the station the temperature 
 is kept at 10 degrees C.To test for   
 freshness a sample batch from each    
 batch is weighed, cracked open onto a 
 glass sheet &amp; the height of the white 
 measured.The eggs are tested for      
 quality by being passed through a     
 "candle machine".This is a cubicle    
 which lights up the egg so that you   
 can actually see inside the egg.All   
 the eggs with cracks or other defects 
 are then removed.The eggs are then    
 graded &amp; hand packed for distribution.</content>
