		<content>    I arise at 0815 and dress. After   
 dressing I go downstairs for          
 breakfast. Weetabix or cornflakes     
 sprinkled with sugar and hot milk     
 followed by toast and orange.         
    Mum takes me to school at 0830. I  
 play for 30 minutes before school     
 starts at 0900.                       
    In the mornings we do a variety of 
 subjects including computer use.      
    After the first break we have      
 assembly and lunch. Lunch consists of 
 meatballs, mashed potato and yogurt   
 for example.                          
    During the next break we play      
 horses with a partner.                
    School ends at 1530 after which I  
 return home for a snack.              
    At 1700 Dad arrives and we have    
 Tea. I then practice on my Guitar and 
 watch some TV before going to bed at  
 2030.                                 </content>
