		<content> Obviously the main industry in this   
 area is{farming,}both arable and      
 animal. The{sewage works}were opened  
 in the 1900's. Today they are working 
 to make it into a{pumping station.    
 They are draining the land so they can
 lay new pipes to Norton as well as    
 Askern, Moss and Fenwick. They will   
 store the sewage in a big tank before 
 pumping it to Norton. In the olden    
 days the{brickworks}produced bricks   
 for the surrounding area. The         
 brickworks were opened in the 18th    
 century and closed down in the 1920's.
 You can still see the bricks in most  
 of the houses of Moss and Fenwick.    
 The quarry is a{lake}now. They have   
 competitions to see who catches the   
 most fish. You can see the{chimmey    
 from miles around dominating the      
 surrounding area.
