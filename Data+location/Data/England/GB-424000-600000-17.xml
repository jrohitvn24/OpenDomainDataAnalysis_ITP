		<title>17VIEWS ON THE POWER STATION</title>
		<content> I think most of the people we asked   
 did not want a{nuclear power station} 
 in this area,but some did not mind if 
 it was placed somewhere else.         
 they all agreed that it would provide 
 more jobs but this would decrease the 
 number of people working at the       
 local pit.                            
 Most people said it would affect      
 people's health,especially the        
 old.For question number four  the     
 people said it would spoil the        
 enviroment.                           
 Number five proved the most difficult.
 Most of the people (e.g the old) would
 have to stay where they are now as    
 they have established their homes to  
 suit themselves for the rest of their 
 lives. Overall most people would want 
 to move if a{nuclear power station    
 was built in this area.
