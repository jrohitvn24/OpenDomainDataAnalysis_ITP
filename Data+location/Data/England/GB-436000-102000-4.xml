		<title>04BEAULIEU VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    Beaulieu is a small village in the 
{New  Forest.}In Beaulieu there is a   
 school that has about 100 children in 
 it.There is only one bank in Beaulieu 
 and that is a {LLoyds Bank.           
    On the main road there is a bridge 
 going over a tidal river.The  river   
 leads to a {lake.}The lake isn't      
 tidal.                                
    On the main road there is a        
 chocolate shop that is {World Famous. 
 Along the same side there are lots of 
 private buildings. Along the other    
 side there is an art shop that sells  
 lots of paintings.                    
    I think the biggest attraction is  
 the motor museum. In it there are lots
 of vehicles and other attractions.
