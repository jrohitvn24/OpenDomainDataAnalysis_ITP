 village.It is mainly built of rubble  
 but the tower is of brick.The tower   
 has a clock on three sides and in 1985
 they are being repaired and regilded. 
 The vicar and his father are doing the
 painting and gilding.The clock        
 mechanism was built in 1809 by        
 Thwaites and Reed Ltd.,who look after 
 Big Ben.
