		<title>04Scroggs Pond in Wharton Wood</title>
		<content> This pond which is really a small lake
 was formed around 1912, it is about   
 1.5 metres in depth                   
  The largest fish ever caught was a 10
 pounds (4.5 kilograms).  Other fish in
 the lake include: tench, perch, roach 
 and eels.                             
  To be able to fish the lake you must 
 be a member of the Gainsborough       
 Angling Club, only 50 people can fish 
 the lake with a special permit.  Other
 people who wish to fish the lake have 
 to put their names on a waiting list. 
  There are 7 types of bird who live on
 and visit the lake: mallard, canadian 
 goose, tufted duck, teal, water hen,  
 heron, and willow wabler.             
  The pond is polluted by nitrogen,this
 chemical is used on the land as a     
 fertilizer, and is leeched out of the 
 soil by rain which then drains into   
 the pond.                             </content>
