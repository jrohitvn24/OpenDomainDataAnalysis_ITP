		<title>02Battle of Bossenden Wood.</title>
		<content> In the south west corner of the area  
 bordering on farmlands, lies Bossenden
 (pronounced 'Bozenden') Wood, on the  
 edge of the Blean.  This was the scene
 of the last occasion when the army was
 brought in to put down civil unrest in
 England. In 1838, John Tom, a young   
 Cornishman, calling himself Sir       
 William Courtenay, set up as a        
 Messiah, urging the local labouring   
 men to rise 'for the rights of the    
 poor' against their masters. Having   
 killed the constable sent to arrest   
 him, Courtenay spent the night at     
 Bossenden Farm, and the following     
 morning he and his small band of loyal
 followers faced a detachment of       
 Infantry and in the 'battle' that     
 followed, lost his life.  The site of 
 the battle, never very obvious, is now
 totally obscured, but the name remains
 as a landmark in local history.       </content>
