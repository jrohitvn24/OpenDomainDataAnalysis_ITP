		<content>At Chistmas time Arthur went to Oxford 
with his sister and Mum to do some     
Christmas shopping. He said for a      
special treat they would stop at a tea 
shop for tea and cakes. Then they would
catch the train home back to Mansmoor  
Halt,from there they had to walk home. 
When we first went into his yard he had
a lot of chickens. He also has a very  
large orchard at the back of his house 
which contained pear trees. He has a   
bit of allotment to grow potatoes on.  
When we arrived he was just going out  
side to sow the potatoes. He has a few 
fields which he uses for hay. He does  
not like sprays so he never uses them. 
In his fields grow orchids and         
cowslips. Fencott and the villages     
around might be having a motorway built
but he opposes it and says that it will
spoil the countryside and the peace and
quiet.                                 </content>
