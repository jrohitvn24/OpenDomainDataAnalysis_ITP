		<content> Most of us have hobbies,some go to    
 B.B.- the Boys Brigade and some like  
 to collect things.I go to the B.B. on 
 Tuesdays and Thursdays.I play games   
 such as snooker,table tennis,darts,   
 chess and draughts.On Mondays and     
 Wednesdays I go to the London Gym Team
 which performed on the South Bank by  
 the Thames on July 3rd and have been  
 at the Albert Hall.On a Friday I go to
 the London Band who teach you new     
 marches.I have to play the            
 drums,bugle,and glockenspiel and      
 I'm allowed to enter many             
 competitions.The band went to the     
 Albert Hall and played at the Royal   
 Tournament on 22nd July.Some other    
 people collect and swap stickers and  
 then stick them into scrap books.     
 People also enjoy reading.One group   
 liked books by Enid Blyton,Noel Streat
 -field and L.M.Alcott.                </content>
