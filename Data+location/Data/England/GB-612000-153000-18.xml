		<content>{New House Lane}has a community of     
 about 100 dwellings, mostly post-war  
 houses and bungalows. In 1951 the     
 residents raised money to build a     
 hall, the only local amenity, for     
 social activites now also serving as  
 the church of St. Faith. The lane is  
 served only by the{Post Bus}which,    
 since 1972, has operated as a passen- 
 ger service between Canterbury,       
 Crundale and Godmersham. The mini bus,
 a Leyland Sherpa, with seating capa-  
 city for 11 passengers, is ideal for  
 negotiating the narrow lanes. It makes
 two journeys a day. The driver        
 delivers mail on the outward journey  
 and collects from the Post Boxes on   
 the return journey. The driver will   
 also collect stamped mail from resi-  
 dents. Sometimes the bus is used as a 
 means of admiring the countryside.
