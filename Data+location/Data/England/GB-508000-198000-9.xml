		<title>09Watford news-ASDA SUPERSTORE</title>
		<content>ASDA are building a superstore on the  
old ODHAMS site. It will have a car    
park for 1500 cars. It will sell a wide
range of products and attract customers
from a wide area. This will increase   
traffic in the area a great deal.  It  
will also affect the trade of other    
shops in the Garston area. It will     
provide jobs for a large number of     
local people.                          
{CONCRETE BATCHING PLANT.}  On Tuesday 
June 25th 1985 a public enquiry opened 
into the proposed development of a     
concrete batching plant in the area.   
Those opposing the development claim it
will result in increased noise due to  
shunting of trains, pollution in the   
form of dust and an increased volume of
traffic.                               
{GARSTON INFANTS SCHOOL} - will move to
the Lea Farm School site into a new    
building late in 1985.                 </content>
