		<content>   My husband is a Chartered Building  
 Surveyor and is self-employed. He has 
 his office in Ashford High Street and 
 I work for him doing his              
 administration work at home.          
   Our life is a fairly full but simple
 one. Our two children attend Hamstreet
 County Primary School which is just   
 over three miles away from our house  
 and they are picked up each morning   
 outside our gate and taken to school  
 by a school bus. They are likewise    
 brought home here in the evenings. The
 bus arrives to take them to school at 
 approximately 8.30a.m. every week day 
 morning and they arrive home at about 
 3.45p.m. each day. My children enjoy  
 swimming and my husband and I and the 
 children usually go by car on a       
 Saturday morning to Hythe Swimming    
 Baths.
