		<title>19THE BURTON PIDSEA PLAYERS</title>
		<content>      The Burton Pidsea Players formed 
 in September, 1979. The Players have  
 to be over 17 years of age. At present
 there are 24 Players.                 
      The Players put on two major     
 shows each year, a Spring Show and a  
 Pantomime, plus additional            
 entertainments for the local Darby and
 Joan Club and Church Concerts. They   
 meet every Monday night at 8 p.m.,    
 usually in the Village Hall.          
      Donations are given to charities 
 and local causes from money raised    
 from the annual carol singing. They   
 hold a Jumble Sale around September or
 October to raise funds for the annual 
 senior citizens' parcels, which are   
 delivered in costume.                 
      This year's panto is to be the   
 Wizard of Oz. Preparations began in   
 July when the parts and scripts were  
 given out.                            </content>
