		<title>1614,THE SQUARE,LEASINGHAM.</title>
		<content>  14,the Square,was originally built   
 in{1655 }as two houses and was later  
 built into one.During the plague it   
 was Leasingham's mortuary house and   
 some_where in the big garden the dead 
 were buried.There is an old{ghost     
{story}about the house. One night,the  
 old owners of the house decided to    
 hold a Chistmas party and just about  
 everyone was invited. After the party 
 had gone on for a while, Mrs Yates    
 was walking down the hall when a      
 little man appeared,wearing a nightcap
 and floating over the stairs.Then he  
 dissappeared.                         
  About a week later their daughter    
 came back from school saying that a   
 girl who had lived in the house before
 them had a rocking chair and every    
 night a man sat cross legged in       
 it,wearing a night_cap and rocking    
 away and chuckling to himself.        </content>
