		<content>There is a wide diversity of housing in
our block. Due to the land being       
primarily agricultural land there are  
obviosly a large number of farm houses.
  Other housing in the area varies from
cottage terrace, built about 1840, to  
Â£superior dwellings' built within the  
last year.                             
  In our survey it was discovered that 
the majority of residents had lived in 
the area for less than 20 years. This  
is undoubtadly due to the building of  
the Rainford Junction Estate.This      
estate consists mainly of semi-detached
dormer bungalow design. Most of the    
older cottage terrace property is      
situated along Bushey Lane, which is   
the main road through the Junction.    
  The Bickerstaffe area offers the     
widest variety. Of particular interest 
is an old windmill converted into a    
luxory home.                           </content>
