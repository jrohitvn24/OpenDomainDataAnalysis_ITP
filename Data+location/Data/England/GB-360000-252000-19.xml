		<content> Pencombe Hall was built in 1862,by Mr.
 R.Arkwright.There was a farmhouse on  
 the site,that was pulled down.        
    Pencombe Hall is now a rest home   
 for elderly people.It has 16 people   
 living in;13 staff and one part time  
 gardener.It is set in beautiful       
 surroundings,with a view of the       
 Malvern Hills.                        
   Residents,that are able,can walk    
 around the grounds.Those who are not  
 so mobile can be taken outside in     
 wheel chairs by the staff.            
   They have breakfast in their own    
 bedrooms and the other meals of the   
 day are taken in the spacious dining- 
 room.Television can be watched in the 
 lounge,in comfortable arm chairs.     
   There is a lift to take residents   
 and their visitors to all floors.
