		<content> Improvements made where I live.       
      My Mum thinks that the{Council   
 have already improved the area. I     
 think that they could improve it a bit
 more by building a few more shops on  
 the corners of the streets and using  
 up some of the{waste ground}that is   
 about, by putting in a few more parks 
 with better{facilities.               
      I also think that the{Council    
 should start thinking about people    
 whose houses are not big enough for   
 them. There are too many people living
 in the same house. I know someone who 
 has four children and there are three 
 beds all lined up in the same bedroom 
 because they have to share a room.    
 They only have a two_bedroomed house; 
 one for the parents, the other for the
 children. It is a squash for such a   
 big family.
