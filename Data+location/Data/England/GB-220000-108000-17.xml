		<title>17ADULT LEISURE TIME IN BUDE</title>
		<content> Most adults tend to spend much of     
 their spare time at home gardening and
 reading. Many adults tend to be       
 middle/old aged and are too old for   
 taking part in sports. Since the area 
 is isolated from{Bude,}people find  it
 difficult or costly to travel         
 frequently into town. As a result,    
 many people develop their own         
 interests at home - e.g. Mr Walsworth 
 at Brookled enjoys being an amateur   
 radio-ham.                            
   However some people travel into Bude
 to play at the tennis, golf, and      
 badmington clubs.Other people keep    
 their own horses at livery at one of  
 the many local stables such as{       
{Broomhill.}The area lends itself to   
 horse-riding since there is much open 
 countryside. For entertainment people 
 have to travel to {Plymouth}for the   
 theatre, and{Bude}for the cinema.     </content>
