		<content>Then I watchedthe "Philadelphia        
Experiment" and "Splash". Both of these
were hired from our video club. After  
that I went upstairs and had a bath and
then crawled into bed at 21.30, looking
forward to Friday and Emma Cowley's    
disco. I eventually fell asleep, but   
woke up again from a nightmare about   
being kidnapped, and school going on   
until 21.00. I suppose I do sometimes  
like school, mostly when there is      
Games, and Swimming or Art. I like     
Maths and Decimals as that is what we  
have been doing these past few days.
