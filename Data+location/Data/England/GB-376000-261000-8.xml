		<content>{A WEEKEND. }On Friday I am always     
 pleased to arrive home from college   
 and relax by sitting on a comfortable 
 chair and quietly watching television.
   I{play my trumpet}in the county     
 Orchestra. So usually on a Saturday   
 morning I attend the rehearsals and am
 fetched home at lunchtime. In the     
{afternoon}I take the family dog for a 
 walk around the village, or spend time
 in the kitchen cooking. In the{evening
 I often go out with my friends to a   
 night club or wine bar in the town. At
 the disco we dance, drink and chat and
 thoroughly enjoy ourselves.           
   Each{Sunday}I attend the family     
 service at church and at lunchtime a  
 Sunday roast dinner is cooked.I spend 
 the afternoon doing homework for      
 college, in the evening I watch       
 television and return to college on   
 Monday.           by Vanessa Ashley.  </content>
