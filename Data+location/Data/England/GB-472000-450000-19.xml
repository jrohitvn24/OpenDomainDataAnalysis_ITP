		<title>19WILBERFOSS PEOPLE LEAVING</title>
		<content> In Wilberfoss many people come to live
 only for a short time,sometimes for   
 five years or less.There are many     
 reasons for moving.Often it is because
 jobs are being changed,or because a   
 larger house is needed owing to a     
 larger family.People moving said that 
 they were looking forward to going,but
 would miss the friends they had       
 made.Some people are not moving out of
 the area altogether,but want to be    
 closer to work,often in York.
