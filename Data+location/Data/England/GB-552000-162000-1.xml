		<title>01MID DARENT VALLEY, SHOREHAM</title>
		<content>  The River Darent, its valley, and    
 hills east, between the villages of   
 Shoreham and Eynsford, is arable and  
 dairy farmland, but contains some     
 managed deciduous woodland. Crops     
 include wheat, barley, maize, peas,   
 oilseed rape, and the last remaining  
 hop garden in NW Kent. The woodland   
 includes beech, birch, and sweet      
 chestnut which is coppiced in seven   
 year cycles, for use as fencing. The  
 river is approximately 30 metres above
 sea level, the chalk hills of the     
 North Downs forming a landscape       
 designated as of "Outstanding Natural 
 Beauty", rising to 200 metres on both 
 sides. The A225 road from Sevenoaks to
 Dartford and the main railway line    
 from Maidstone to London run          
 northwards parallel to the river.     
 Lullingstone Roman Villa excavations  
 and Lullingstone Castle are both open </content>
