		<title>19Tourism Problems in Shoreham</title>
		<content>   After questioning people in Shoreham
 it was found that they thought        
 Shoreham lacks facilities and         
 entertainment for potential tourists. 
   The residents said that Shoreham    
 should build more and better          
 facilities.When asked if they would   
 welcome more tourists they showed     
 mixed feelings,but most agreed as more
 facilities would be built.Others said 
 "No"as it would spoil the peace and   
 quiet.The residents attitudes to      
 whether too many tourists came,were   
 non-plussed.Too many tourists didn't  
 come.The sea would not be the only    
 attraction;hotels would be needed if  
 tourism were to be encouraged.Most    
 people disagreed to a hotel being     
 built.But as they had earlier said    
 that they would agree with the influx 
 or even wanted more tourists they had 
 contradicted themselves.              </content>
