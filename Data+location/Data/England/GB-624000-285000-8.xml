 Clothes worn, vary depending on the   
 work to be undertaken. Of those people
 interviewed most wore old clothes to  
 work on the farms. Some wore suits or 
 similar smart clothing and changed    
 into comfortable trousers,sweaters and
 shirts when at home. Denim jeans are  
 popular for men and women as they are 
 easy to wash and hard wearing.        
 Ladies wore either skirts, dresses or 
 trousers for everyday and 'best' wear.
 Men wore trousers, jacket shirt and   
 tie for best and jeans or trousers and
 tee shirts or sweaters for casual     
 wear. Wool,cotton and other natural   
 fibers are used but a large amount of 
 man made fibre such as nylon and      
 acrilan is used in clothing mainly    
 because of easy washing.
