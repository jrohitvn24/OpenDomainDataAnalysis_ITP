		<content> Barnsley is situated within South     
 Yorkshire and over the last year has  
 been at the forefront of local and    
 national media. The mining dispute and
 the abolition of the South Yorkshire  
 council has caused this to be so.     
    The town has its own newspaper, the
 Barnsley Chronicle which is edited and
 printed in the town and covers all the
 local issues: It is a weekly journal  
 that is on sale on Fridays. We also   
 have a free paper called the          
 Independent which contains            
 advertisements and news snippets.     
 Added to these there is the Barnsley  
 Star which is printed in Sheffield but
 carries local news items.             
    There are no television or radio   
 stations in our town but we are able  
 to tune into Yorkshire T.V and the    
 radio stations Sheffield, Leeds,      
 Hallam and Aire.                      </content>
