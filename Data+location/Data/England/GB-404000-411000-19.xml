		<title>19A DESCRIPTION OF OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> The Colne Valley got it's name from   
 the River Colne which runs through it.
 A  main road,a canal,and a railway    
 line also run through the area. The   
 railway station is just a wooden      
 platform with a small shelter on it.In
 Slaithwaite there are quite a few     
 shops.The houses are built out of     
 different materials,some are local    
 stone and slate roofs others are built
 of bricks and tiles.Because the area  
 is a steep sided valley most of the   
 houses are built in the valley bottom,
 although some are built on the sides. 
 Slaithwaite is in the parish of St.   
 James.The biggest school in the area  
 is the Colne Valley High School,which 
 has about 1800 pupils aged 11-18.This 
 school has about 20 feeder primary    
 schools,which means that they are     
 quite small.On the hillside are       
 several chapels.{   Catherine Lawson. </content>
