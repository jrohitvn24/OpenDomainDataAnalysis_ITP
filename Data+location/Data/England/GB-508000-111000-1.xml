		<title>01GENERAL VIEW - SULLINGTON</title>
		<content> This area comprises the southern half 
 of the sprawling parish of Sullington.
 It is a very pleasant rural area north
 of the South Downs between two        
 villages, Storrington and Washington. 
 Country roads lead to the Southdown   
 Way which runs along the top of the   
 downs.  At Chantry Post, 189 feet     
 above sea level, one can enjoy        
 panoramic views of the surroundign    
 countryside and southwards to the sea.
 A walk through the farmyard of        
 Sullington Manor, with its ancient    
 tithe barn leads to the Parish Church,
 part of which dates from Saxon times. 
 St. Mary's Church at Washington is    
 also worth visiting.                  
 On the Eastern boundary the dual      
 carriageway facilities travel         
 southward to Worthing and to Horsham  
 in the North.
