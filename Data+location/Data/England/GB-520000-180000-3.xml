		<content>The centre of North  Hammersmith &amp;     
Kensington is covered by wasteland,    
Wormwood Scrubs. Parts of this         
wasteland have been developed into     
an adventure playground for children,  
made mainly from logs and wood. There  
is also an area designated for wild    
life to grow and develop. There is an  
area of tents called Tent City,where   
people can stay temporarily. A stadium 
has been built for people to use for   
athletic training and school sports    
day,there is also a football ground,   
cycle speedway track, tennis courts,   
and playing field.A canal runs to the  
north of the Scrubs land and follows   
the railway.The canal has been polluted
over the years, and at present, work is
underway to restore the canal to its   
former state.
