		<title>19RIPPINGALE GROUP OF CHURCHES</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Rev.R.Harris is the incumbent of  
 the{Rippingale Group of Parishes}which
 consists of Rippingale,Dunsby and     
 Dowsby.It is not uncommon in rural    
 areas to group parishes together under
 the care of one priest,for reasons of 
 economy and a shortage of clergy.The  
 parishes of Dunsby and Dowsby became  
 united in 1934 and the responsibility 
 of the Rector of Rippingale in 1967.  
{Rippingale and Dowsby}are dedicated to
 St.Andrew,the Patron Saint of         
 Seafarers,a reminder of the days      
 before the fens were drained and the  
 sea was close.{Dunsby}is dedicated to 
 All Saints.All three churches date    
 from about 1250.Although attendance is
 only about 12% of the population the  
 Church is still a unifying force in   
 the social and spiritual life of the  
 community.                            </content>
