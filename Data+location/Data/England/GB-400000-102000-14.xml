 checks the poultry. On Tuesdays,      
 Thursdays and Fridays cuts down       
 lettuce and delivers it to Wimborne,  
 on the same day if he's lucky. Other  
 days he prepares and plants see3ds. Mr
 Hiscock used to take a horse and cart 
 int Wimborne but now he uses a van.   
{MR HISCOCKS' HOME LIFE IN HOLT

 the peace and quiet of the village.   
      His daughter owns a horse        
 called Misprint. Mr Hiscock keeps     
 him in a field next to his market     
 garden.
