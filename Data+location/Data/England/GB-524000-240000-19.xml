		<title>19EVENTS AT THE ASHWELL SHOW</title>
		<content> The Horse Show has continuous events  
 ocurring in four rings. There are the 
 usual classes for horses and ponies.  
 The Driving Class for horse and trap  
 undertakes a marathon ( about 5 or 6  
 miles through surronding countryside. 
 Local shops, industries and Inns      
 provide sponsorship for the events.   
 This year the Cambridgeshire Foxhounds
 and the West Lodge Harehounds mustered
 and paraded. There is also a Dog Show,
  it is licensed by the Kennel Club and
 run by a nearby town dog training     
 club. They decided on three classes, a
 novelty class, a pedigree class and an
 obedience class. Many local traders,  
 organisations, charities, craftsmen   
 and artists take trade stands, over   
 sixty of them this year, in order to  
 show their wares. There are also side 
 shows like bingo, hoopla, coconut shy,
 and spin a bottle and a sweet stall.  </content>
