		<title>03A Whitby Fisherman's Week.</title>
		<content>  My dad, Peter Leadley, is Skipper of{
 "The Success", a large{trawler}with a 
 crew of five. On Sunday night at about
 8.00 p.m. when it's high tide, he     
 sets off from the harbour until he's  
 about ten miles from Whitby.Then he   
 puts the nets down and{drifts}for     
 fish.He pulls the nets up and puts the
 catch into ice boxes.                 
  He stays awake while the crew sleep  
 until it's someone else's shift.In the
 morning, five miles from Sandsend, he 
 puts the nets out again.He has        
 something to eat and then drifts      
 another three miles to net more fish. 
  Later, he heads for home because the 
 ice boxes should be full.He arrives   
 home on Tuesday morning when the fish 
 are off-loaded, weighed and the fuel  
 tanks re-filled.He sails off again,   
 further this time and returns on      
 Friday and pays the crew.             </content>
