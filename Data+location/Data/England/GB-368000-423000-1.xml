   This is an area of wide diversity   
 situated between the towns of         
{Blackburn and Darwen.                 
   The character  of the area changes  
 with the contours. In the valley there
 are the remnants of old established   
 industries such as cotton and paper   
 mills. Higher up the valley sides     
 new industries have been built on     
 greenfield sites. These include carpet
 manufacturers, the largest steel      
 stockholders in the World and light   
 engineering factories. Higher still,  
 on the moorland,hill farming continues
 with little change over the years.    
   New housing estates have been built 
 to replace large areas of terraced    
 housing which formerly served the     
 cotton mills, but many terraced areas 
 still survive.
