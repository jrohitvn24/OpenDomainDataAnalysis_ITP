 The village of Dalwood is situated in 
 a sheltered valley in East Devon      
 between the towns of Honiton and      
 Axminster.  It lies between two ridges
 of the Blackdown Hills. Through the   
 valley runs the Corrie Brook, a       
 tributary of the River Yarty, itself a
 tributary of the River Axe. The       
 village population is around 500. The 
 village is of considerable            
 natural beauty and in 198? won a 'Best
 Kept Village' award.Local amenities   
 include a Village Stores, Primary     
 School, village Inn and Hall. Local   
 buildings are of stone, cob and       
 thatch. The village is surrounded by  
 farm land. Dalwood means 'dale in a   
 wood',though there are now less trees 
 and hedges than fifty years ago.      
 Dalwood was originally in Dorset.
