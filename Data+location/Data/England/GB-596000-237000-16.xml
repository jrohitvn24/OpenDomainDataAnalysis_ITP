  Since 1945 mains water,sewerage and  
electricity have been connected to most
houses and Polstead's only street light
erected.Residents in their forties     
remember evenings by the light of an   
oil lamp,and carrying pails of water   
from the pump on the Hill,taken away in
1955,and now the site of the 'phone    
box.Trees have been planted on the     
village green.The Methodist church at  
the Heath closed in 1985 and has been  
sold.Twenty five council houses were   
built in Rockalls road,and some sold to
the tenants.Large building plots have  
been split up,and a lot of "infilling" 
has taken place.Two Eastern Counties   
'buses no longer call at the           
village.Not long ago the milk was      
brought by Mr Knott in big churns on a 
horse cart.The cycle shop has gone from
the village green.                     </content>
