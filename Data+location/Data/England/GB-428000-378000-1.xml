 Woods,farmland,housing,the Poly tower 
 blocks,a main road,the railway,all    
 backed by the higher moorland beyond, 
 appear to be the first impression of  
 this area.A closer look reveals an    
 area with a fascinating history and   
 many interesting features,including   
 ancient woods and houses,accommodation
 for the severely handicapped,a home   
 for children in care,excellent walking
 country,Britain's second longest      
 railway tunnel,a shooting range,      
 kennels for unwanted dogs,and a       
 pleasant residential area with homes  
 which range from the single person's  
 flat to the large mansion in its own  
 grounds.A wide range of facilities    
 provide for most of the locals' needs 
 and for some of the needs of those    
 who come for further education or just
 a good meal.                          </content>
