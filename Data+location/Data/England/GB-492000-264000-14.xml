		<title>14EMPLOYMENT:LABOUR MOBILITY</title>
		<content>In a survey of sixty-six families in   
Irchester we found that only 3% of the 
fathers worked in the village.Most     
fathers worked in the two nearby towns 
of Wellingborough (18%) and Rushden    
(16%).Of the others 15% were not based 
in any one particular place but moved  
around. One father travels to Milton   
Keynes which is 20 miles away and one  
to London, over 60 miles away.15% of   
the fathers are self employed and 9%   
are unemployed.We think that so many   
fathers work outside the village       
because there are not many jobs for    
men here. 53% of our mothers are       
housewives and do not have a paid job. 
A quarter of mothers work in the       
village mainly in part-time jobs and   
the rest work either in Wellingborough 
or Rushden. In a survey of Rushden     
shoppers 55% had a member of the family
that worked outside Rushden.           </content>
