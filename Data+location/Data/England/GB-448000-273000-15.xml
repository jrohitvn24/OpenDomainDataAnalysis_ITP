		<title>15SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT.</title>
		<content> The houses around the school are      
 mainly terraced and are between 80 and
 100 years old.There are many places of
 worship, with temples in Kimberley    
 Road and Craven Road,a mosque in      
 Grosvenor Road,a gospel hall on the   
 corner of Corbett Street and Chester  
  stret,and an Elim Church in Cambridge
 Street as well as the parish          
 chuch.These different types of places 
 of worship cater for people from      
 different backgrounds in our multi-   
 cultural area.                        
 It is a convenient place to live,being
 near town and near the railway station
 Most people live here because of their
 jobs.My parents moved to Rugby from   
 Hong Kong because my father used to   
 work in a take-away in North Street.  
 Many people hav extended their houses 
 in the front and have modernised them,
 thus changng them over the years.     </content>
