		<content>This mainly farmland and wooded area   
was designated to be the largest New   
Town in the North West.  However, after
much pressure from the local community 
it was decided that industry would be  
limited to the two industrial sites of 
Red Scar and Rough Hey and a different 
area south of the Ribble was chosen to 
be the new town.                       
The region is left for those who like  
to fish, ramble and birdwatch. The     
local trees are mainly oak, beech,lime 
horsechestnut, sycamore and elm. Wild  
flowers include the greater stitchwort 
rootstock, red clover, ox-eye  dog rose
and great willow herb.  Birds to be    
spotted in the area include kestrels,  
herons, dippers, great black backed    
gulls and sparrow hawks.
