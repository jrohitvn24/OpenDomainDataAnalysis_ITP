		<title>04LINEAR PARK</title>
		<content> The linear park lies on the site of a 
 single track railway which ran from   
 Manchester to Saddleworth to serve the
{'Delph Donkey'}, an historic train of 
 some repute locally. Its present use  
 is both imaginative and useful.Its    
 inception was to recreate the natural 
 countryside and restore land for the  
 use of the community. The park is a   
 success. It is well used by the local 
 community who respect the facility    
 provided for them. The trees are      
 flourishing, the old stone station    
 house,lived in and restored,provides a
 glimpse into its Victorian past. A    
 children's play area and an old mill  
 cottage nestle alongside the river,   
 blending in perfect harmony with      
 the landscape. Today's environmental  
 planners have utilised the past       
 perfectly to serve the needs of       
 present day society.                  </content>
