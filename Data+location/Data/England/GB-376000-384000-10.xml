		<title>10SURVEY OF PLACES OF WORSHIP.</title>
		<content>    A small group of pupils discovered 
 that the area was well served by      
 places of worship. All the main       
 denominations were represented. The   
 area covers the three Established     
 Church Parishes of Hale Barns with    
 Ringway, Hale and Ashley. The earliest
 was found to be the Unitarian Chapel  
 of l723. Most of the other churches   
 had been built within the last one    
 hundred years, the Jewish Synagogue   
 was the most recent. All of these     
 churches looked well cared for and    
 well used.
