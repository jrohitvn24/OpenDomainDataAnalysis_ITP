		<content> The main through road in the area is  
 the A12. The A12 is a major dual      
 carriageway trunk route and in the    
 area consists of two or three lanes in
 each direction. The A12 by-passes     
 Ingatestone which was formerly a      
 bottleneck on the old A12. Along      
 Ingatestone High Street there is      
 frequent evidence of its importance in
 previous times with a number of old   
 courtyards which contained stables in 
 the days of horse-drawn transport. The
 narrow High Street may sometimes      
 revert to carrying the traffic of the 
 A12 when there are road works or when 
 the main road is closed due to an     
 accident - when this happens there is 
 considerable congestion.              
 The other roads in the area are       
 unclassified and take mainly local    
 traffic.
