		<title>13A NEW INFANT SCHOOL, GRAYS</title>
		<content>  The new{THAMESIDE INFANT SCHOOL}has  
 been built on Thameside Juniors'      
 running track. The old infant school  
 used to be in Arthur Street. It was   
 opened on June 4th 1888. 97 years     
 later, on Thursday the 6th of June    
 1985, the Juniors greeted the Infants 
 parading into their new school, which 
 is now in Manor Road. Unfortunately it
 was drizzling with rain, but that did 
 not stop the spirit of the infants    
 marching to their new Manor Road      
 school. There were teachers, mothers  
 and children marching. The infants    
 played musical instruments and carried
 banners. Before they went into their  
 school a small ceremony was held. A   
 school governor smashed a bottle of   
 champagne on the wall of the new      
 school. Everyone went inside the      
 building to begin a new era of        
 education in South Grays.             </content>
