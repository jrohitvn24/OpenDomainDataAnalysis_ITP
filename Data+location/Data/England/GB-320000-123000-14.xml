		<title>14EVENTS RIVER TONE STRUGGLE</title>
		<content> Every September since 1972 there has  
 been a race for home_made craft over  
 10 miles of river between Wellington  
 and Taunton.In 1984,83 craft entered,9
 sank,71 finished.The winning time was 
 2hrs 38mins.Thousands of spectators   
 lined the river bank,and over Â£3,000  
 was raised for charity.This year owing
 to the drought the water level was so 
 low that in some places crews had to  
 pull their craft along.Martin Wotton  
 told us;" Our raft was made of wood,  
 polystyrene,plastic barrels and a N.W.
 cone.The crew of four wore safety     
 helmets.We started at the Tone bridge 
 in Wellington and finished at         
 Goodlands Gardens in                  
 Taunton.Navigation was difficult in   
 places because of weirs,shallow       
 water,sharp bends and overhanging     
 branches.we were glad of a drink of   
 hot soup."                            </content>
