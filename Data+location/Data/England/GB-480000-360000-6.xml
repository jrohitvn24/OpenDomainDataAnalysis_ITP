		<content>{John Blow Primary School}was built in 
 1963 to cater for children from the   
 ages of 5 to 11.There are 7           
 classrooms,a large assembly           
 hall,kitchens and extensive playing   
 fields.180 children attend full       
 time,enjoying the facilities of a     
 modern,well equipped school.          
 The aims of the school are to provide 
 an{evenly balanced curriculum}which is
 constructed in such a way as to       
 encourage each child to learn and grow
 according to his or her needs.Also to 
{develop socially }caring for each     
 other and the surroundings in which we
 live.Because of this,{environmental   
{work }is at the centre of the         
 curriculum.During the past two years {
{computer learning}has been introduced.
 The future will see more emphasis     
 being placed on technology and it is  
 for us to prepare children for this.  </content>
