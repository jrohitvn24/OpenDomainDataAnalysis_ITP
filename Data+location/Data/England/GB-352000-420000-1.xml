		<content>{Charnock Farm Nursery}opens at 9.00am,
 sometimes earlier.During the winter it
 closes at 5.00pm but in summer is open
 until 9.00pm.The owner has lived in   
 the area since 1904 and has owned the 
 farm since 1973.Before becoming a     
 commercial grower he was in the army. 
 The Garden Centre sells almost        
 everything for the gardener including 
 plants,trees,sheds,greenhouses and    
 garden furniture as well as fruit and 
 vegetables.The land around the Nursery
 has been farmed since 1680 but over   
 the years much of it has been put to  
 other purposes and the Nursery alone  
 remains.The owner employs five part   
 time workers who do everything        
 including stacking the shelves at the 
 end of the day.As many as 1200 people 
 may visit the Nursery on busy Sundays 
 in the summer.
