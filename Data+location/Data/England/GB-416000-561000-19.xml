		<title>19A WINLATON COUNCILLOR</title>
		<content> Mr. Bob Baker has been a member of    
 Gateshead Council for the last eight  
 years.                                
 When asked about changes in Winlaton  
 he replied that in his lifetime it had
 grown from a small village into a     
 large town. He said that Winlaton     
 people used to be called "spikers",   
 but that now they are called          
 "Winlatoners". He believed that the   
 town had changed for the better.      
 He said in reply to a question that   
 vandalism was a modern problem that   
 involves young people.                
 He said that he did well at School,   
 and that he had taken his "O" Levels  
 and gone on to University, all of     
 which he had found useful.            
 Asked if he had met any famous people 
 he replied that he had met the Queen  
 and Mr. Neil Kinnock.
