		<title>03Withy growing. Kingsbury.</title>
		<content> Today,the 4th of June,we went to see  
 some withies.We went to the moor with 
 a withy grower.The withies we saw were
 twenty centimetres tall.They are grown
 on the moor because it is wetter      
 there.They spray them once a week to  
 kill aphids which lay their eggs in   
 the top.They have to kill the aphids  
 because they damage the tops and cause
 new shoots to grow at the bottom.This 
 lessens the growth of the main shoot, 
 which makes it no good for basket-    
 making.Sometimes bugs bite into the   
 leaves and galls appear.The galls are 
 red and look like the blisters you get
 when you have pinched yourself.In     
 August the withies stop growing and   
 the leaves fall off.They do not cut   
 them down until November.This gives   
 them time to harden.They cut the      
 withies with a cutter fixed behind a  
 tractor.                              </content>
