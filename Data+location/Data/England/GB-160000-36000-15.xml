		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE</title>
		<content> I got up and wondered if we were going
 to the beach.I asked my Dad who said  
 we would go to Kenneggy. After        
 breakfast Mum asked me and my two     
 sisters to pack our beach bags while  
 she packed the picnic lunch.          
 We drove to Kenneggy and walked down a
 long overgrown path to a ladder which 
 lead down to the beach. I was pleased 
 to see two of my friends who joined us
 on an expedition over the rocks.      
 The first bay we came to was filled   
 with seaweed about 10cm deep. With    
 excitment we waded through it. At the 
 other side was a pretty waterfall     
 which made a brown iron stain on the  
 rocks. We climbed up a steep rock face
 to the coastal path which led us back 
 to the ladder. We hungrily ate our    
 picnic and then went for a quick swim.
 At 6pm we went home for tea.I watched 
 T.V.and then to bed.What a lovely day!</content>
