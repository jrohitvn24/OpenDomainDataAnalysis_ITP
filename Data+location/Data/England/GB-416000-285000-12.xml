		<content> In Chelmsley Wood the people live a   
 modern life. In a survey of the area  
 nearly every family owned a colour    
 T.V. and 40% owned a video. The people
 of Chelmsley Wood seem to make full   
 use of the areas facilities visiting  
 pubs, clubs and restaurants in the    
 area. Also most people, even though a 
 high unemployment rate exists, try to 
 take an annual holiday. Many young    
 people were interested in sport and   
 visited the Youth and dance clubs in  
 the area. Gardening is high on the    
 list of hobbies with the older        
 generation whereas music and sport is 
 very inherent amongst the culture of  
 the young.Breakdancing and bodypopping
 have become something of a sub culture
 around Chelmsley Wood. Nearly everone 
 asked still has a roast meal on Sunday
 but oriental food dishes are taking   
 the place of fish and chips.          </content>
