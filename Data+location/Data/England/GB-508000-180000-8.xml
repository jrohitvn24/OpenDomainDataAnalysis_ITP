		<title>08PUNJABI SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Every Saturday morning I wake up at 7
 o clock ready to go to Punjabi School.
 After eating breakfast my brother and 
 I go to my brother's friend's house.  
 He also goes to the same school.      
 School starts at 10 o clock. It is    
 held at Beconsfield School.           
  There are 3 Punjabi classes and 2    
 Hindi classes. We have our class in a 
 home economics room.  Our teacher is  
 paid by the Ealing Borough. The       
 headmaster and caretaker are also paid
 by Ealing. School ends at half past   
 twelve.                               
  We then show our mother what we did  
 at school. We normally write letters  
 and learn words. We are given         
 homework.                             
  I enjoy punjabi School and find it a 
 good way to learn my mother tongue.
