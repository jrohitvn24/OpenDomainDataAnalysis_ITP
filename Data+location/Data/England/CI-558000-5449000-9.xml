		<title>09A TYPICAL DAY FOR CATHERINE</title>
		<content> Mum, my human alarm, wakes me at 7.00 
 a.m. - earlier if I have homework.    
 After climbing out of bed, I wash or  
 shower.  At about 7.10 I get dressed  
 and go downstairs to the kitchen,     
 collecting the milk on the way.  I    
 usually spend about a quarter of an   
 hour having my breakfast and then     
 talking to my mum, making my lunch    
 whilst I find my bus money.  In the 20
 minutes between 8.00 and 8.20 I       
 usually practise my flute, piano or   
 dancing and at 8.20 I go to meet my   
 friend who walks to the bus with me.  
 The bus should have come by 8.45;     
 although school starts at 8.55, we    
 don't usually get there until 9.00.   
 We have an hour's lesson after 25     
 minutes of form time.  From 10.30     
 until 10.45 we have break.
