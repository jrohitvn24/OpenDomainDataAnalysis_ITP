		<content> The Parkwood Trading Estate was       
 established about 30 years ago and is 
 still growing. It contains both large 
 and small businesses. Three long-     
 established car-sale and repair firms 
 employ about 500 people between them, 
 while a BMX bike firm set up in 1982  
 only employs 15 people. Other estate  
 occupants include a steel engineers, a
 dairy, a chemist wholesalers, an      
 elecrode paper manufacturer, and a    
 firm producing crackers, balloons and 
 other novelties.                      
 Before the Leonard Gould factory in   
 Pickering Street was built in 1926,   
 the land was farmed. Since then the   
 factory has grown to cover its present
 5.5 acres. It employs about 150 people
 and specializes in packaging.         
 Around Boughton Green are some small  
 businesses, including Astra Lamp bulb 
 factory, Kent Valves, and a pottery.  </content>
