		<title>19RICHMOND GREEN</title>
		<content>{Richmond Green}is situated just off   
 the town centre. It is used for       
 cricket matches in the summer as well 
 as the annual Richmond May Fair.      
 Around the green are several notable  
 buildings including the gateway to    
{Richmond Palace.}An earlier palace was
 burnt down in 1499, and the gateway is
 all that remains of the palace built  
 on the same site by Henry VII. It was 
 Henry VII who was responsible for     
 changing the name of the village from 
 the Anglo-Saxon "Shene" meaning       
 "shining place" to Richmond after his 
 Yorkshire home.{Richmond Theatre}"the 
 theatre on the green" was designed by 
 Frank Matcham and opened in 1899. It  
 still presents a full programme,      
 including many plays before they open 
 in the West End. Houses around the    
 green are highly sought after and     
 fetch a high price.                   </content>
