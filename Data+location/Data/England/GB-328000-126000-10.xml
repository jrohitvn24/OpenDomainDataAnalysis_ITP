		<title>10BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON CANAL</title>
		<content>  The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal runs
 through our area.The canal does not   
 carry commercial freight now but it is
 still important in the area.It is a   
 drainage channel,supplies water to    
 industry,provides water for fire_figh_
 ting and supplies a drinking water    
 reservoir.It is also of environmental 
 and recreational benefit to the area. 
  The one canal building left is the   
 Engine House at Charlton.It is a ruin 
 but there are plans to make it safe   
 and use it as an information and      
 picnic site.All along the towpath are 
 concrete pill boxes dating from the   
 Second World War.                     
  Clear notices show it is an offence  
 to obstruct the towpath,to ride bikes 
 or horses,to leave litter,fire guns,  
 throw stones,pollute the canal or fail
 to obtain the correct licence for a   
 craft navigating the canal.           </content>
