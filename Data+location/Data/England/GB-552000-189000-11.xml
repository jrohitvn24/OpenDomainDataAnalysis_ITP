		<title>11My Memories of the Infants</title>
		<content> The infants school which I attended   
 was small but pleasant. The classrooms
 were full of colourful pictures as    
 well as the hall in which there was a 
 picture of the Royal Familly on one   
 wall opposite a picture of an         
 aeroplane on the other. The hall was  
 full of P.E apparatus amongst which my
 favourite was the rope ladder. Every  
 Thursday we had country dancing, and  
 on Tuesdays we had "Time &amp; Tune". Each
 year during the Summer we had a sports
 day and when all the races were       
 finished we had an ice lolly. At my   
 last Christmas in the school I took   
 part in the school play "Hansel &amp;     
 Gretel" (I played the father. I was   
 sad to leave the school which was     
 tragically burnt down in a fire which 
 I witnessed. The school was completely
 destroyed but I will never forget old 
 Hilldene school.                      </content>
