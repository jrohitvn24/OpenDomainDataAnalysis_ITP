		<content>  A mainline railway runs through our  
 area.   It starts in London at        
 Waterloo station and comes through    
 Devon and on to Cornwall.   The       
 nearest station to Kilmington is      
 Axminster.  After that, it goes to    
 Honiton, Feniton and Exeter.          
 The price from Axminster to London is 
 Â£16.50 for an adult and Â£7.80 for a   
 child (return).                       
 The price from Axminster to Exeter is 
 Â£3.20 for an adult and Â£1.60 for a    
 child (return).                       
 There are fewer trains now than there 
 used to be, and they do not stop at   
 Seaton Junction any more.   There are 
 no stopping points in our grid        
 squares; the trains just travel       
 through the area.                     
 On the fast, inter-city trains, it    
 takes about three hours to get to     
 London.                               </content>
