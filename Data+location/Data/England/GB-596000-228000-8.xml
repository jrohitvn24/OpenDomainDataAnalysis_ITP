		<title>08INDUSTRY-A FRUIT FARM</title>
		<content> AROUND WEST BERGHOLT,BOXTED,AND GREAT 
 HORKESLEY THERE ARE MANY FRUIT FARMS. 
  THESE ARE OWNED EITHER BY LOCAL      
 FOLK,OR BY A LARGE COMPANY IN LONDON, 
 THAT EMPLOYS A MANAGER TO RUN THEM.   
   THEY GROW APPLES,PLUMS,PEARS,STRAW- 
 BERRIES,AND RASPBERRIES.IN THE WINTER 
 WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD THE GROUND IS 
 COVERED IN FUNNY LOOKING PLASTIC      
 SHEETS WHICH KEEP THE COLD OUT.VERY   
 FEW PEOPLE WORK ON THE FARMS DURING   
 THE WINTER,BUT IN THE SUMMER THE FRUIT
 HAS TO BE PICKED QIUCKLY WHEN IT IS   
 RIPE.THE FARMS ADVERTISE FOR PICKERS, 
 AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE GO AND PICK   
 THE FRUIT-HOUSEWIFES,STUDENTS,AND EVEN
 OLD AGE PENSIONERS.ONE LARGE COMPANY  
 HAS ITS OWN BUS TO TAKE THE PICKERS   
 BACK INTO COLCHESTER AT THE END OF A  
 HARD DAY IN THE FIELDS.THESE FARMS ARE
 SAID TO BE VERY PROFITABLE ,ESPECIALLY
 IF THE HARVESTING WEATHER IS GOOD.    </content>
