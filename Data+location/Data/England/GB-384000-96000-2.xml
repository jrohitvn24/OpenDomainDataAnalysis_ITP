		<title>02   The River Winterborne.</title>

   The water table in the valley bottom
 changes very much during the year. In 
 the winter the water level is only    
 about twenty centimetres below the    
 school, but in the summer it can be   
 eighteen to twenty metres below.The   
 high water levels usually come in     
 February and this is when the river   
 starts running. The River Winterborne 
 rises at Winterborne Houghton and     
 joins the River Stour at Sturminster  
 Marshall. The river is a clean chalk  
 stream and there are two trout farms  
 along the length. The river is usually
 dry by the end of June.One year,1976, 
 the river did not run at all because  
 it was a very dry winter.Before the   
 river bed was dug out about 60 years  
 ago the village was flooded every     
 winter and the children could not go  
 to school.                            </content>
