		<title>06Dorchester Bypass</title>
		<content>  The  A35 (East to West) through      
 Dorchester becomes too congested with 
 tourist and local traffic, especially 
 in the summer months. If nothing is   
 done it will become worse each year as
 traffic increases. Accidents and noise
 could be reduced by the construction  
 of a bypass.                          
  The{Southern Route}would pass very   
 close to large housing estates and    
 cause a lot of nuisance to the        
 residents, but it would be quicker for
 Industrial vehicles from Bridport.    
 A local farmer thinks this route would
 spoil the view from Maiden Castle.    
  The{Northern Route}would only disturb
 four homes and it would pass across   
 open land. This route would be better 
 for most traffic which comes from the 
 North.                                
  The final decision about the route   
 has not yet been made.                </content>
