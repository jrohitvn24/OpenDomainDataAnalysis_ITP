		<title>06A Vets Day (2)</title>
		<content> After the test three more calls to    
 see a calf with pneumonia,a goat with 
 mastitis,and a cow with a lame foot   
 before a call on the radiophone tells 
 me to return to the surgery to see a  
 sheep with a prolapsed cervix.An      
 interview with a pharmaceutical co.   
 rep. and the spaying of a cat precede 
 my lunch of fish and chips.           
     At two o'clock afternoon surgery  
 is the usual mixture but phone calls  
 soon summon me to two farms with calf 
 scouring problems.Back for 5 o'clock  
 surgery to find six people waiting    
 with various pet problems including a 
 cat with cancer which sadly has to be 
 euthanised.Just as I think the days   
 work is finished a call comes in at 7 
 o'clock to attend a calving.9pm is    
 time to watch the news and eat supper 
 before attending to my own animals    
 hoping to finish at about 12.30 am.   </content>
