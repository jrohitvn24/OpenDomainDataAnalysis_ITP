		<content> A group of children visited Aerospace 
 on Wed.12 June.We discovered that it  
 is both a civil and a military        
 works.                                
       The frames for Concorde were    
 made here and the engines were tested 
 at the  Rolls Royce Works nearby .The 
 aircraft had a successful test flight 
 in the 1960's.An early Concorde now   
 minus it's engines is still to be     
 seen. American F111s,swing wing jet   
 fighters are often seen.They are      
 serviced at Aerospace.Small single    
 engined Chipmunks are used as training
 aircraft by University students       
 attached to the R.A.F.Aerospace has a 
 good reputation for manufacturing     
 aircraft wings.                       
  Last year there was an air display   
 of many famous aircraft of the        
 past,including the well loved Spitfire
 .                                     </content>
