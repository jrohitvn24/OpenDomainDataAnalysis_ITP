{Primary School                        
{Built} 1891                           
 The school is at the Eastern side of  
 the village across from the Village   
 Hall and Playing Field.Next to the    
 school is the school house.It is empty
 All round the school is a wall about  
 6ft high except at the front where    
 there is a rose garden.The old toilets
 are across the yard and are now used  
 for stores.There are new indoor       
 toilets built in 1981.There used to be
 a wall down the  playground centre to 
 keep the boys from the girls.In each  
 class there used to be open fires and 
 then coke stoves.Now there is oil     
 fired central heating.There is a spire
 on the top of the roof with a bell.It 
 used to be rung from inside the class 
 room by pulling a rope.Now we just    
 shout "time".                         </content>
