		<title>10The Removal of the Cross</title>
		<content>    Over the years the cross has been  
in need of repair.  In 1526 a certain  
lady left, in her will, 12d every year 
to repair the cross, this is the       
equivalent of 5p.  In 1925 the cross   
was in need of repair and it was       
restored by order of His Majesty's     
Office of Works.  The cross over the   
years has stood in many places, the    
last time it was moved was in 1966 and 
that was for road improvements by the  
Urban District Council.  It was taken  
down stone by stone, each one being    
carefully numbered and stored.  The    
shaft itself was wrapped and cased in  
wood for protection.  In the soil      
beneath the cross several items of     
Roman origin were found.  The cross    
was then reconstructed accurately in   
the centre of the new traffic island   
where it stands today.
