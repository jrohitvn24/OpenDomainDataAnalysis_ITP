		<content> For most people in this area home life
 is pleasant and comfortable. Homes are
 in a state of good repair and many    
 people do their own decorating. The   
 most widely used fuels for domestic   
 heating are coal and electricity. Gas 
 is available and a few homes use this.
 Electricity is the most popular means 
 of cooking,followed by gas. Bottled   
 gas is used in some outlying          
 areas.Numerous electrical appliances  
 are used in the home, workshop,garage 
 and garden. Many homes have a         
 telephone.  People appear to be safety
 conscious in their homes, having fire 
 guards and first aid boxes. A good    
 proportion possess fire extinguishers 
 but very few have fire blankets for   
 the kitchen. Most families can enjoy a
 garden and many grow their own        
 vegetables, some having an allotment.
