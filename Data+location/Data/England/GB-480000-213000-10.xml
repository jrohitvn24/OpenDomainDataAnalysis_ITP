		<title>10LANGUAGE IN AYLESBURY</title>
		<content> The population of Aylesbury contains a
diversity of peoples who originate     
from many different countries.These    
people have brought with them a        
variety of languages and cultures      
which add greatly to the community.    
 Some examples of European languages   
spoken in addition to English are:     
French,Spanish,Italian and Polish.     
Whilst the Asian community in Aylesbury
speak Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujrati,   
Bangali, Afgani, Farsi, Pashto and     
Arabic.                                
 Many of these families would speak    
their native language as their first   
language, with English being spoken    
outside the home, often being learnt by
children in school.                    
 There is a Language Centre in Dunsham 
Lane where English is taught to school 
age children who come to the country   
with no spoken English.                </content>
