		<content> In 1911{water}was brought to Tisbury  
 by mains. However, Court Street did   
 not have water from mains until some  
 time later. If you listen outside     
 Court Street Farm you can hear running
 water and this is where Tisbury used  
 to get its water from.                
   There used to be an{electricity     
 company in Tisbury which got its power
 from the water mill turbines and it   
 supplied electricity to the whole of  
 Tisbury and Wardour. In 1930 Wessex   
 Electricity Company took over         
 production but in 1938 production of  
 electricity in Tisbury ceased.        
   Parish records show that{gas}used to
 be used for street lighting.          
   The average size of a Tisbury family
 100 years ago was larger than it is   
 now but the population of Tisbury is  
 about the same.
