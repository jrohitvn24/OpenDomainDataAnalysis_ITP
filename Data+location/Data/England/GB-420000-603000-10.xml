		<title>10Arable Farming/Guyzance Area</title>
		<content> The fertile soils of the area enable  
 extensive cultivation of arable crops.
 The main crop grown is barley.Although
 spring barley is still sown,farmers   
 are increasingly changing to autumn   
 drilled seed.The seed germinates      
 before winter and in early spring it  
 is top dressed with nitrogen based    
 fertiliser to encourage rapid growth. 
 The barley can be harveted in mid-    
 summer.Much of the crop is crushed for
 animal feed but surplus grain is sold 
 through a local farmers'co-operative. 
 The most common root crops are        
 potatoes and turnips(swede).The latter
 are used for winter fodder for cattle 
 and sheep.Recently farmers have been  
 encouraged by subsidies to grow oil   
 seed rape and brilliant yellow fields 
 have become a feature.The land is     
 fertilised with farmyard manure and   
 Nitram chemical fertiliser.           </content>
