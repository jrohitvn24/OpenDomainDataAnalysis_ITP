<title>05Ovington and Neighbourhood</title>
<content>

Ovington continues to be a small village of around 120 inhabitants (including some 25 children from age 4 to teenagers) and some 65 dwellings.  Some large new properties have been built though the village continues to be surounded by unspoilt countryside.  The post office/shop closed in 2000 with the Inn and village hall continuing to provide centres for relaxation, though current economic pressures are bearing on both establishments.  Surrounding land continues to be used for agriculture, primarily grain and rape with some grassland.   &lt;br />
