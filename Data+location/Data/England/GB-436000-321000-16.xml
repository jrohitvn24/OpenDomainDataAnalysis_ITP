		<content> The former stables to Staunton Harold 
 Hall,round an open courtyard have been
 separated into 10 units,one rsidential
 &amp; the rest leased by different        
 craftsmen comprising the following    
 trades. Numbers in brackets refer to  
 the people employed:-violin maker(1), 
 forged ironwork(2), woolcrafts(3),    
 "Busy Sheep" woollen &amp; skin goods(4), 
 wood turner(1). A tearoom adjoining   
 employs 1 to 4 people according to    
 season. All of these people were      
 obviously devoted to their craft,     
 making a steady but not substantial   
 living. They all benefited from the   
 steady stream of customers to the     
 adjacent nursery &amp; from visitors to   
 the Sue Ryder Home occupying the hall.
 The hall , nursery, craft centre &amp;    
 Cromwellian church are in a very      
 attractive setting &amp;popular with      
 visitors throughout the year.         </content>
