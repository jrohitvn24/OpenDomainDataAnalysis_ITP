		<title>07   BALTERLEY POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content>     Balterly Post Office is a small   
country shop.There are hardly any      
houses near it except a few cottages   
and an occasional farmhouse.Mr Dean    
has owned the Post Office for 32       
years.As well as a Post Office he also 
sells groceries.Before the building    
was a Post Office it was an Inn.It is  
over 200years old and is in an acre of 
land with some outbuildings one of     
which was a bakery for bread.          
   Most customers come from Audley or  
Balterley.In 1934 Mr Dean toured       
Balterley as a travelling salesman.    
After World War 2 Mr Dean returned to  
take over Post Office.He is usually    
very busy but he thinks working in a   
shop is most interesting if you like   
the company of different types of      
people.Mr Dean thinks the people       
of Balterley are very friendly.
