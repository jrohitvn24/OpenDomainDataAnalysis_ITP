		<title>04OCCUPATIONS IN BISHOP BURTON</title>
		<content> Occupations of people resident in the 
 village fall into 3 broad categories: 
                                       
 1.  Those people who live in the      
 village and work in or around the     
 village.  These are mainly{farmers and
{farmworkers.  Some do domestic work.  
 There are very few who fall into this 
 category.                             
                                       
 2.  People who live in the village but
{commute to work}in outside towns such 
 as Beverley, Hull or York.  This      
 represents the majority of people in  
 Bishop Burton.                        
                                       
 3.  People who live outside the       
 village but work within it.  They are 
 mostly connected with the{Agricultural
{College,}their work ranging from      
 lecturing to gardening to catering.
