{Steep}is a small village about a mile 
 north of Petersfield. It gets its name
 from the dramatic landscape around it 
 which has been known for about 100    
 years as 'Little Switzerland'. It is a
 popular local beauty spot. The village
 is a straggle of houses with one shop,
 a pub, garage and small primary       
 school. The Church of All Saints      
 stands at the top of the main road.   
 Bedales school is an important part of
 the village.                          
{                                      
{Stroud}is West of Petersfield and even
 smaller than Steep. The site of a     
 Roman Villa was found there and       
 excavated by people from Bedales      
 before World War II but it has now    
 been covered over. Stroud has a       
 primary school but no church.
