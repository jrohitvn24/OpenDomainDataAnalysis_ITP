		<title>18THE VILLAGE IN THE PARK</title>
		<content>   The village is a lovely place where 
 people who work in the park can live. 
 It was developed in two stages: the   
 old village near the Isle of Wight    
 pond which was built at the time of   
 Queen Victoria, and the new part      
 built during the 1950's.  About 250   
 people live there.                    
   It looks very pretty with a pond, in
 which the residents can fish, and a   
 playground for the children.  The     
 quaint old Post Office near the       
 village green is the only shop they   
 have.  There is a private White bus   
 service which takes people to and from
 Windsor every day.                    
   The York Club is a general Sports   
 Club which doubles as a Polling       
 Station at the time of Elections.     
 There is a bar there as well as       
 facilities for many sports.
