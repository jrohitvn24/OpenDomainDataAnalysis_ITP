		<title>01HOUGHTON CONQUEST</title>
		<content> Houghton Conquest is a village of     
 contrasts. Originally a farming       
 settlement, it is now mainly a        
 dormitory settlement for local towns  
 such as Bedford, Ampthill, luton and  
 Hitchin as well as for brickfields.   
 There has been much modern development
 especially in the centre of the       
 village with the result that the      
 actual inhabited area has increased   
 little over the past thirty years.
