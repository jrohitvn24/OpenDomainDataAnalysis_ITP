		<title>01Lower Kentmere - General</title>
		<content> The survey area is undulating upland, 
 split north to south by the valley of 
 the river Kent. The highest parts are 
 to be found in the north west (472m.) 
 and south east (419m.) corners, but   
 generally, the land is rising towards 
 the north and the high fells of       
 central Lakeland. Towards the south,  
 the area gives way to the broad valley
 followed partly by the lower Kent and 
 routes between Windermere and Kendal, 
 and then to the irregular landscape   
 which leads to Morecambe Bay.         
 The survey area is sparsely settled,  
 Kentmere village lying immediately to 
 the north of it. Farming is the main  
 activity but the factory of British   
 Industrial Sand is of interest.       
  A quiet valley such as this does not 
 escape tourists, the valley floor road
 enabling people to reach well in to   
 the hills before starting a walk.     </content>
