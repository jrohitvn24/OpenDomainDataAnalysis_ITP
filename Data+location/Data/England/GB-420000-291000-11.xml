		<title>11SHOPPING</title>
		<content>    Although there are two shops in the
 locality these do not carry a big     
 enough range of goods to satisfy      
 peoples needs. One shop is a Post     
 Office &amp; general store, the other a   
 newsagents &amp; and general store.       
    Most people, therefore, leave the  
 villages to do their main shopping    
 many people go to Coleshill,Chelmsley 
 Wood, Tamworth or other nearby        
 shopping centres, whilst a big        
 percentage make use of the Hypermarket
 at Minworth.                          
    For clothes &amp; larger consumer      
 goods, Birmingham is used by about 80%
 of the people, some also use the      
 smaller shopping centres &amp; one or two 
 use Coventry. 39% of the  people      
 surveyed use Catalogue Shopping as a  
 convenient mean of buying clothes.
