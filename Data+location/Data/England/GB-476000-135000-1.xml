		<title>01BORDON- AN OUTLINE.</title>
		<content> This survey covers part of the village
 of Bordon in Hampshire and Kingsley   
 and Oakhanger to the East and North.  
 The whole was once part of the Royal  
 Forest of Woolmer but because of the  
 coarse sandy soils it was reduced to  
 heathland as early as the 15th        
 century.Used as a training area for   
 troops stationed at Aldershot, it's   
 prosperity began in the early part of 
 the century when a permanent camp was 
 built at Bordon.This was enhanced by  
 the building of the Petersfield to    
 Aldershot road (now the A325) and two 
 railways connecting to Bentley in the 
 North and to Longmoor in the South,   
 the latter run by the military as a   
 Royal Engineer's training railway. The
 closure of the railways in 1968 did   
 not affect the growth of the village. 
 It is now almost a small town  with   
 much light industry and services.     </content>
