		<title>13CHANGES ON A FEN EDGE FARM</title>
		<content>    The fields themselves at{ Chalk    
{Farm}have not changed much in overall 
 appearance since Enclosure, however   
 the types of crop and the nature of   
 farming have changed considerably over
 the past 150 years.                   
    The main change has been the shift 
 from sheep farming to mixed farming to
 today's entirely arable farming.      
    A major effect on farming in       
 general in recent years has been      
 membership of the Common Market, but  
 the effect on Chalk Farm has been     
 minimal, although the farmer thinks   
 that he would probably grow more      
 barley and less wheat if there was not
 encouragement from the Common Market  
 to do otherwise. Chalk Farm is an     
 ideal barley farm.
