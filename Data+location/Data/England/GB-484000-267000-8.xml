		<content>{KINGDOM HALL}is the place of worship  
 of the{Jehovah's Witnesses}and is     
 situated in Olympic Way. It was built 
 in 1979 and is 'L' shaped. In other   
 churches there are priests, but       
 Witnesses have elders. To become an   
 elder you must be male and at least 30
 years old. It is also necessary to    
 have a thorough knowledge of the Bible
 and the practical problems of everyday
 life like marriage and financial      
 matters. Before becoming an elder, one
 is appointed as a ministerial servant,
 a helper of the elders. In            
 Wellingborough there are about 9      
 elders and 13 ministerial servants.
