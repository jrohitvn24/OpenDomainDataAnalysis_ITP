		<content> Because of the ever present dangers   
 to the Methane Terminal and Oil       
 Storage Depot sited along the         
 riverside coast of{Canvey}as well as  
 the need for another means of exit in 
 case of an evacuation of the          
 population, a new road - an extension 
 to the A130 to{Chelmsford}was built in
 1972/73. The land to the West of Long 
 Road/Canvey Road is a large privately 
 owned marshland pasture, used for     
 cattle grazing. It was over this land 
 that the much needed second access    
 road to{Canvey}was built. The A130    
 crosses the Benfleet Creek and the    
 rail line to London and joins the A13 
 to London, Texaco oil tankers use this
 road.                                 
  As a single carriage way road it has 
 provided somewhat inadequate for the  
 volume of traffic using it, so a      
 double carriage way is planned.       </content>
