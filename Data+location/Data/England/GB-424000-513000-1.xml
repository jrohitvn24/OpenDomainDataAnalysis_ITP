		<title>01SOUTH WEST DARLINGTON</title>
		<content> Darlington developed into an          
 industrial town based on railways     
 during the 19th century.  What is now 
 the south west edge was owned by      
 the influential Pease and Backhouse   
 families. Their large country mansions
 are now mostly replaced by 20th       
 century dwellings. These are the homes
 of the professional and middle classes
 in the main.                          
                                       
 The south west of the town is mainly  
 residential and divided by the main   
 access road, the A66, into two parts. 
 North of the A66 is a large area of   
 private housing and to the south is a 
 large council estate.                 
                                       
 The approach to the town from the A66 
 is from the south, the A1(M) and      
 Richmond or from the west and Barnard 
 Castle via the A67.                   </content>
