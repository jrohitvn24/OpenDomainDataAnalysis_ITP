		<title>08Woodleys Farm</title>
		<content>Woodleys Farm looks after 300 acres of 
land.They own about 200 acres and they 
rent the other 100 acres off Blenheim. 
3 people work on the land regularly.The
farm rent machinery like a combine     
harvester.They only have cows and a few
hens.Most of the crops are grass which 
is made into silage and is used for the
cows.The other crop is wheat.There is  
very little woodland.In the farm there 
are 4 cottages.The A34 cuts off one    
field from another.A "B" road cuts off 
a lot of fields.It is sometimes a lot  
of trouble,because when they move the  
cows from one field to another all the 
cars have to stop to let them pass.The 
owners of the farm are Mr.and Mrs.     
Ponsonby.
