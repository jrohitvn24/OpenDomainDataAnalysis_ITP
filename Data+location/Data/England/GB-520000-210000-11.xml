		<content> Entertainment in the Garden City is   
 mainly provided by the {Barn Theatre }
 and is supplemented by the {Welwyn    
{Thalians. }The Barn Theatre is {300 } 
 years old and was moved to its present
 site in {1830. }Originally it was     
 known as the Handside Barn and prior  
 to its thespian activities was a dairy
 and a clubhouse for Welwyn Department 
 Store employees.Between October and   
 July the drama group are involved in {
{10}productions,at least one enters    
 competions at national level.The      
{Welwyn Thalians }was formed by joining
{2}existing societies, the Barnstormers
 &amp; the Operatic Society. There are {50}
 members who rehearse in our block but 
 use the near by facilities of Campus  
 West,our Council Leisure Centre,to    
 stage their productions.
