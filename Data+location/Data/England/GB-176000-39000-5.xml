		<content> Perran-ar-Worthal   C.P.  School   was
 built in 1878 and most of the original
 buildings, except the old toilet block
 are still in use. The toilet block was
 was replaced in 1980,  when new child-
 rens toilets,  staff  toilets  and  an
 office were added.We also have a temp-
 orary classroom in the playground  and
 another one is about to arrive.We have
 125 children and four classes (two ju-
 nior and two infants).  As well as the
 headteacher, there are  3 other  full-
 teachers  and a part-time teacher  who
 teaches half-time. We have 2 lunchtime
 supervisors,   a helper for the Rising
 Fives, a school secretary and a care- 
 taker.   We have a large country play-
 ground  surrounded  by  trees  but  no
 hall. Meals are cooked on the premises
 and eaten in the classrooms.We use the
 Village Hall  for PE  once  a week and
 the village Playing Field for games.  </content>
