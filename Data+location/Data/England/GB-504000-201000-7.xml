		<content> Across the road from Pale Farm &amp; the  
 Old Forge and facing the common is the
 Two Brewers Hotel,a successful small  
 member of a large international chain.
 The 16th century building incorporates
 former shop,ale house &amp; schoolmaster's
 house. A traditional English dinner   
 costs Â£10.50. Accommodation with twin 
 beds, shower, T.V.&amp; kettle costs Â£35. 
 There is also a simpler, self-service 
 buffet lunch served in the lounge or  
 very popular public bar. Many visitors
 relax &amp; enjoy the rural atmosphere of 
 the common,by drinking, picnicking,   
 watching cricket or walking in the    
 woods. An annual event, attracting    
 visitors in July,is a group meeting of
 Morris Men who camp in the village &amp;  
 dance outside the 4 public houses,    
 (namely: The Two Brewers, The Boot,   
 The Windmill &amp; The Royal Oak).
