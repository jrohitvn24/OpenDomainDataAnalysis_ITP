		<title>17GHOST STORIES,DUNTISBOURNE</title>
		<content> As with most Cotswold villages there  
 are tales of mysterious happenings    
 and haunted houses.Two teenagers told 
 us eagerly of a "haunted holly        
  tree".In the past the ghost of a bad 
 character was supposed to lurk near   
 the tree. Nutbeam farm,probably in    
 parts the oldest property , is also   
 visited by ghosts.There are tales of a
 ghostly monk and secret rooms.One lady
 in the village was in service there   
 and said there was something stange at
 Nutbeam, possibly a walled-up room.   
                   From the very same  
 house to Hoar stone ,in the SW,a white
 lady passes,her silk dress rustling as
 she goes.Another story tells of 12    
 phantom men and a priest who carry a  
 golden coffin across the road and     
 disappear into a field.All our visits 
 were during daylight hours so we saw  
 none of these curious creatures.      </content>
