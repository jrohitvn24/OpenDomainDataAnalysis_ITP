		<title>18  Employment in Radcot area</title>
		<content> Thames Water employs men at the Lock, 
there is a one-man car repair business 
associated with a farm and the public  
house provides work for four people.   
Other than this farming is the only    
source of employment. In addition to   
the farming families, a dozen people   
are employed on the farms. Women find  
domestic work in the larger houses.    
 The economy of the area is enhanced   
by the tourist trade. There are 3      
Caravan Club Sites, one a farm site    
in Thrupp, the other 2 are riverside   
sites. In addition a large riverside   
rally site has space for about 60      
caravans, rallies are held on most     
alternate weekends. This site is       
attractively laid out with Cricket Bat 
Willows planted to mark out individual 
pitches.  There are moorings for about 
75 motor cruisers along the Thames and 
it's backwaters, around the bridge.    </content>
