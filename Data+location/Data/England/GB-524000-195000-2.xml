 IN SPRING,I GO POND DIPPING WITH A    
 FRIEND,WE FIND FROGSPAWN. I EMPTY MY  
 NET INTO A LARGE BOWL,THEN I ROLL UP  
 MY SLEEVES AND PLUNGE MY HAND INTO THE
 COLD WATERS.I THEN BRING UP SOME WEEDS
 AND PUT SOME IN MY BOWL.              
 IN THE SUMMER MY MUM TAKES ME DOWM TO 
 THE CLIMBING TREE,JUST ON THE EDGE OF 
 THE WOODS. THERE IS A LITTLE CLEARING 
 IN THE GRASS WHICH LEADS DOWN TO IT.  
 THE CLIMBING TREE IS AN OLD FALLEN    
 DOWN TREE WITH LOTS OF BRANCHES. OFTEN
 WHEN WE GO THERE WE TAKE A PICNIC.    
 IN THE AUTUMN I GO  WITH MY DAD AND   
 SISTERS BLACKBERRY PICKING. MY DAD    
 USUALLY PICKS THE MOST.               
 IN WINTER, AT SCHOOL, WE HAVE GAMES ON
 THE COMMON AND THE BOYS PLAY FOOTBALL.
