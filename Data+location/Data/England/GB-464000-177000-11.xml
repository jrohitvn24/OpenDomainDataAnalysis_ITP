  When I get home I change out of my   
school clothes. I have something to eat
like sweets and a biscuit and go out to
play. I like riding my bike or playing 
in the woods making camps or tracks for
my bike. I sometimes play snooker or   
pool on my friend's snooker table. I   
like playing with Technic Lego.        
  I usually have my dinner between 5   
and 6o'clock. My dad is still at work. 
My favourite dinners are meat pie, new 
potatoes and carrots or sausages, chips
and beans. I have an iced bun or fruit 
for my pudding.                        
  After dinner I play on the Recreation
Ground for a while and come indoors at 
about 8.30pm. I usually have a bath    
before going to bed. I like to have a  
bag of crisps, a biscuit or a small    
salad for supper. I clean my teeth and 
go to bed between 9 and 10 pm.         </content>
