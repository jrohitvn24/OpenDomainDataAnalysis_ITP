		<content> The village of Littlebeck is mainly a 
 methodist village. It has its own     
 chapel and belongs to the Methodist   
 Circuit of Whitby. The Reverend is not
 resident but serves five other        
 Methodist chapels in the area.        
 Services are held every Sunday. There 
 is no other church or chapel in       
 Littlebeck.                           
 Catholics have to travel to Sleights  
 or Whitby for services. The nearest   
 Church of England is St. John's at    
 Sleights, otherwise people attend     
 Ruswarp. Sneaton or Whitby.           
 There are no burial ground in         
 Littlebeck.                           
 Father Postgate was caught in 1678 at 
 Red Barn House whilst baptising a     
 child and taken to York where he was  
 hanged. Father Postgate's rosary and  
 crucifix are still preserved in St.   
 Hilda's Catholic Church, Whitby.      </content>
