		<title>14More Holwell Local History</title>
		<content>    Parts of hedges on the old         
 routeways appear to be several hundred
 years old.The routes can still be     
 travelled by road and footpath.       
    There is a smugglers' route from   
 Sandhills towards Barnes Cross,and    
 a secret passage from Sandhills into  
 Holwell Manor.                        
    The Kings of England once hunted   
 in the Forest.Some local names such as
 Crouch Hill, King's Stag and Buckshaw 
 are associated with hunting legends.  
    Modern hunting still takes place.  
 The Blackmore Vale and Sparkford      
 Vale Hunt,often meet in this area.    
    Indeed the thatched Inn that stood 
 for over a hundred years at Crouch    
 Hill was called the "Fox". Sadly      
 it burned down in 1969 and Holwell    
 no longer has a public house.
