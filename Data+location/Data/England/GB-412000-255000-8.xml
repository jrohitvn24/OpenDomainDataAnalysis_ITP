		<content> In our school we have three classes.  
 Mrs.Langdon has the infants (4-7yrs), 
 Mrs.Escott, the parttime teacher, has 
 the lower juniors (7-9yrs) and Miss   
 Fox,the Head, has the upper juniors   
 (9-11yrs) except when Mrs.Escott is   
 not here then she has all the juniors.
 There are usually between 50 and 60   
 pupils in the school. The juniors have
 their lessons in the school building  
 and the infants in a temporary class- 
 room. We have a tarmac playground to  
 play on, it is marked with a netball  
 pitch, the girls play and they have   
 some matches against other schools in 
 the area. The boys play football on   
 the pitch in the playing field, they  
 have matches against other schools but
 they have to have seven a side matches
 when their are not eleven boys in the 
 juniors. The playing field still has  
 the ridge and furrows on it.          </content>
