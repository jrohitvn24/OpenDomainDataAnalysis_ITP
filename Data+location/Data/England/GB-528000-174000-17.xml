I live in a block of flats called      
Colwall House on the Waltham Estate. My
block of flats are near the shops,     
parks and my school.It takes me 5      
minutes to get to school.My flats have 
5 floors. I live on the 2nd floor.I    
hate living there because there are too
many robbers and kidnappers. That is   
why my mum does not let me play out    
with others people,or go to school by  
myself. There are six rooms in my flat,
2 bedrooms,1 kitchen,1bathroom,1       
toilet,1 sitting room. I have to share 
my bedroom with my sister. I have a    
balcony which is quite small. Soon we  
are going to move away.I have lots of  
friends living nearby but I do not play
with them because they play far away   
and could get lost.My family come from 
Cyprus there is plenty of space there.
