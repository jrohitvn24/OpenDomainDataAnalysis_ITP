 50% of jobs are in farming

 connected with agricuture or          
 horticulture. There is no industry.   
 Casual work on the land is available  
 in the growing season. A few people   
 work in Skegness in the holiday       
 period. About 15% of jobs are in      
 recognised trades. There are few      
 people in business, professional or   
 administrative occupations. Apart from
 agriculture about 15% of people are   
 self-employed. Over 75% of people live
 and work in the village. Despite the  
 number of agricultural jobs there is a
 wide variety of others-actor, serving
