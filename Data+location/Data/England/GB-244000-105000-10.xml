		<content> The village shop is a general store   
 and has served the village for over   
 100 years. It serves about 50         
 customers a day, mostly for groceries.
 It delivers on Saturdays over a 5-mile
 radius. The stock comes by van from   
 Plymouth. It is also a sub-post office
 supplying stamps,pensions and licences
 A home-based man and wife make wooden 
 furniture, loose covers and upholstery
 They also renovate antiques and export
 furniture to the U.S.A.               
 The undertaker and funeral director   
 arranges funerals with the Rector and 
 supplies the coffins. He makes them   
 from oak or pine wood. The wood is    
 bent using boiling water to prevent it
 breaking. He screws the parts together
 and fits metal handles. He fits a     
 plinth to cover the screws. Nowadays  
 most coffins are ready made. His      
 hearse is a black Ford Granada.       </content>
