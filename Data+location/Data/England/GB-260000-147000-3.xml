      There is only one farm and very  
 few houses in the area.   The land is 
 mainly over 1000 feet above sea level 
 and there is no piped water supply.   
 All the existing properties have their
 own wells.                            
                                       
      In the 1890's an attempt was made
 to develop the area around Holdstone  
 Down and 138 building plots were sold 
 but only two bungalows were built.    
                                       
      Private building is now no longer
 permitted as the area is now within   
 the Exmoor National Park.
