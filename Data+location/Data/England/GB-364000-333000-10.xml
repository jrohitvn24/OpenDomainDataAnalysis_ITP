		<content> The major road in the area is the A53 
 trunkroad between Shrewsbury and      
 Buxton via the Potteries.Until        
 1973 this road passed through the     
 narrow town centre of Market Drayton  
 but is now carried by a purpose built 
 by-pass to the N.W. of the town.The   
 A529 is the major N.S. route but is   
 fairly quiet.The town centre streets  
 converge on a wide High Street.A new  
 inner ring road to ease congestion in 
 the narrow streets is partly          
 completed.There is an ongoing debate  
 about a one way system and            
 pedestrianisation of the shopping     
 centre.Local traders are against such 
 development.The rural roads are narrow
 and regular complaints about there    
 upkeep are voiced.Public spending cuts
 are blamed.
