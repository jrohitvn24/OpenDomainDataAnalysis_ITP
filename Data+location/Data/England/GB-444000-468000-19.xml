		<content>{When Dr Eric Waud came to be the      
{doctor of Brafferton and Helperby in  
{l938 there were no street lights as   
{there are now and the only lighting   
{came from the telephone box.Electric  
{light had only been installed three   
{years ago and most people still had   
{oil lamps.                            
{  There was no mains water until just 
{before the outbreak of war and the    
{doctor himself had two water tanks at 
{his house, one for soft and one for   
{hard. There were very few lavatories  
{and most people relied upon earth     
{closets in their gardens. There was no
{mains sewer until the late 1950s.     
{  There were few cars but many pony   
{and traps. Shire horses were widely   
{used on the farms.There were several  
{tradesmen that have now gone:a        
{brewer,station-master,tailor,cobbler, 
{blacksmith,baker and maltster.        </content>
