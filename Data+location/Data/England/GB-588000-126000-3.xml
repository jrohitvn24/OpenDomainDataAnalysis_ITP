		<content>  Owley is a dairy farm with 150 cows  
 of up to 2 years of age, 173 Guernsey 
 milking cows, 4 bulls and 153 calves. 
 The buildings are all purpose built   
 including a slurry store and a        
 milking parlour.                      
  Owley's milking parlour goes slowly  
 round and round while the cows are    
 being milked.  While they are being   
 milked they each have a little bowl   
 which they eat out of; they eat square
 concentrate blocks. After they have   
 been milked they have to get off, but 
 sometimes the cows go round again     
 because they want more food.          
  The milking cows are housed in       
 cubicles and the calves in calf pens. 
 They are fed silage in the cow yard   
 and in their mangers.                 
  Because the farm buildings at Owley  
 are specialised, only 3 men are needed
 to look after the dairy herd.         </content>
