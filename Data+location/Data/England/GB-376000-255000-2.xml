		<content> The most serious crime he has had to  
 deal with was a murder investigation  
 in Worcester.He finds it rather       
 difficult to live a normal family     
 life.People in the locality are       
 constantly knocking at his door or    
 telephoning him with all sorts of     
 problems that they think a policeman  
 should deal with.                     
    As a policeman he is a respected   
 member of the community though people 
 tend to be suspicious of him because  
 of his job. Because of this he has few
 very close friends.In spite of these  
 disadvantages he would still prefer to
 be a policeman in a village rather    
 than one in a large city.             
      When travelling between villages 
 he uses his police vehicle and walks  
 around the villages on foot,which he  
 prefers.When he is walking his beat   
 instructions come from headquarters   </content>
