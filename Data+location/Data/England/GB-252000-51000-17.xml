		<content> A building firm called J.Edgar &amp; Son  
 is building 9 detached four-bedroomed 
 houses on a site by the Lodge. First  
 of all they dig foundation pits and   
 line them with concrete. Then they    
 build a double wall of concrete       
 blocks. There is a gap in between     
 called the cavity to allow air to     
 circulate and keep damp out. Then they
 put in wooden floors, windows, doors  
 etc. They put wooden roof trusses up  
 and cover them with tiles. Then they  
 put in all the wiring, plumbing and   
 plaster the walls inside to a smooth  
 finish ready for painting. The outside
 walls are finished with Arcalite      
 (shiny stone chippings) or left as red
 brick. There are 4 managers, 1        
 plumber, 1 electrician, 2 labourers,  
 1 plasterer and 4 bricklayers working 
 there. It takes 3 to 5 months to build
 a house. They cost Â£85000 to Â£120000. </content>
