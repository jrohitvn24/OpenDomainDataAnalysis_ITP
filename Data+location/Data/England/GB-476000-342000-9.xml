		<title>09Use of the land</title>
		<content> Farming is the staple use of land in  
 this area with ceral crops being the  
 prime acreage with grazing land a     
 close second.As there is little or no 
 milk production all stock is for meat 
 production and this includes,in       
 addition to cattle and sheep,pigs     
 which are reared at Flawborough and   
 Thoroton.One whole concern at         
 Flawborough is geared to large        
 production of pigs for the meat market
 At Thoroton is a large concern with   
 egg production for the grocery market.
 Along with these is the production of 
 wool from the sheep at Alverton.The   
 cereal crops are wheat,barley and oats
 and rape,sugar beet,peas and beans to 
 a lesser degree.Due to overproduction 
 of cereals farmers are beginning to   
 turn to crops such as veg.,lupins and 
 flax.
