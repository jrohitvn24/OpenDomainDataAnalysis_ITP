		<content> The main direction of travelling in   
 our block is east to west along the   
{A57.}The A57 was  built in{1764}as the
{Attercliffe to Worksop Turnpike.      
 Before the A57 was built there wasnt  
 any roads going east to west so the   
 main way of traveling then was north  
 to south. The A57 is a very busy road 
 and lots of cars lorrys and buses use 
 it.Most of the traffic will be going  
 to{Worksop or Sheffield}or to the{M1  
{motorway .}There is a crossroads in   
 Woodsetts one road leads to           
{Gildingwells}and one to{Worksop}one   
 leads to Dinnington but one only leads
 to the Common. There are a lot of     
 tractors in Woodsetts because there   
 are 3 farms{Hoades Farm,Grange Farm   
 and{Bealbys Farm.
