		<content> In the village of Mount there are{36  
 houses.  The old school house and pub 
 are now converted houses.  The house I
 live in was built in 2 stages.  Part  
 of it is 3OO years old.  The rest 5O  
 years old.  Some of the walls are very
 thick, they are made of Cob.  There   
 are l6 bungalows in Mount.  Most of   
 them were built of{stone and granite. 
 Wendy's family lives in 'Milland',    
 Cardinham near old Treveddoe tin mine.
 The cottage is 35O years old and made 
 of granite and stone.  It has 4 rooms 
 and a dairy.  Inside it still has     
 beams with meat hooks hanging from    
 them.  Outside the cottage are        
 orchards and an old cider press.
