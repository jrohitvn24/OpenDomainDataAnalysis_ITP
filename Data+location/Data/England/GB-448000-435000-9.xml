		<title>09TRANSPORT IN CHURCH FENTON</title>
		<content>   Although Church Fenton is a{rural   
{area,}we found that most people do not
 feel isolated. Generally this is      
 because they own a car,(their main    
 form of travel) but also because the  
 village is served by{public transport,
 consisting of daily bus and rail      
 services.                             
   Few people use the{bus service      
 regularly. Reasons given are: it is   
 expensive, buses are too infrequent   
 and choice of destination is too      
 limited.                              
   The{rail service}seems to be used   
 more frequently. About 80 people use  
 it each day. Many are from surrounding
 villages without a station and about  
 half from the RAF base. Reasons for   
 travelling by rail are: it is cheaper,
 faster or more reliable than other    
 transport.The most popular destination
 is York.                              </content>
