 My name is Fatima Bibi.  I come from  
 a family of eight.  When I come from  
 school I do not eat anything.  When my
 dad comes home from work he sits down 
 to read and when it is seven o'clock  
 he goes upstairs to pray.  My mum who 
 is sewing goes to pray, then she reads
 the Koran.  I go to pray after my     
 parents.  When I read the Koran I read
 half a chapter in an hour.  The fast  
 is broken by drinking water or eating 
 fruit.  My mum cooks dinner at nine   
 o'clock, then my parents go to pray   
 for the fourth time.  My dad goes to  
 the mosque.  At eleven thirty the     
 fifth and final prayer takes place.   
 At one forty my mum makes tea and     
 toast.  After we have eaten we then go
 to bed.  The process starts again.
