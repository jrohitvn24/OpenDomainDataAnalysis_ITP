		<content> fine pieces of antique furniture      
 including a beautiful Bechstein Grand 
 piano, with two green matching lacquer
 chests.In the{Drawing Room}there is   
 some furniture from the 18th century. 
 There is a{secret bookcase}into the   
 oldest wing dating from the 15th      
 century. The oldest room in house     
 has a full sized{modern billiards     
{table.}The beams are all hand carved. 
  One of the bedrooms is called the{   
{swallow room}because in the summer    
 someone left the window open and a    
 swallow made its nest in there. There 
 are also stables and a{stud farm,}but 
 when we visited there were only 20    
 foals and horses. When the moat was   
 drained an old{gauntlet}was found from
 a suit of armour. Moyn's Park is not  
 open to the public; the gardens are   
 open occasionally under the National  
 Gardens Scheme.                       </content>
