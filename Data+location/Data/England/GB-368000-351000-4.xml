		<content> Our block is an area of predominantly 
 private housing. Properties range from
 large, mostly pre-war detached houses 
 to small seni-detached cottages. There
 is a great variation in in thw age and
 design of properties: many have       
 undergone modernisation. New          
 development has been kept to a        
 minimum, there being at present only  
 one new housing development sited at  
 Hough village, offereing a range of   
 accommodation in detached and         
 semi-detached houses and bungalows. A 
 special feature is the imaginative    
 planning of the streets and the       
 planting of trees in and around the   
 estate. Use has been made of reclaimed
 Cheshire brick to provide attractive  
 frontages. A mains gas supply has     
 recently been piped to Shavington,    
 Basford, Rope and Hough as a result of
 pressure from local residents.        </content>
