		<content> For years farmers in the area have    
 grown{Brussels Sprouts}which were once
 a market garden crop. The sprouts were
 picked by itinerant and local labour  
 and marketed fairly close to the area.
 Nowadays the large grower of sprouts  
 has his own packhouse and prepares    
 retail packs for the supermarket      
 trade.He also sells through farming   
 co-operatives at Littleton and        
 Cheltenham as well as on the open     
 market and to private dealers.        
{Winter cabbage}is grown in the area   
 mainly Savoy and January King as well 
 as about 50 acres of Spring and 30    
 acres of Summer cabbage.              
  {Potatoes}are grown by only two      
 farmers in the area who have a        
 combined acreage of 50.{Tomatoes and  
{Capsicums.}About an acre and a half   
 acre are grown under glass. These are 
 marketed or sold locally to the shops.</content>
