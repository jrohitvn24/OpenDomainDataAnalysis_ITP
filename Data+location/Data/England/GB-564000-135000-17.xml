		<title>17   Leisure in Lamberhurst</title>
		<content>    The{children}of the village have a 
 large number of places in which to    
 play. There are many{footpaths}and    
 a large{playing field.                
{   Lamberhurst has}grown around the   
 point where the main road crosses the 
 River Teise. The river rises near     
 Tunbridge Wells and joins the River   
 Medway at Yalding.{Fishermen}of all   
 ages regularly try to catch the perch,
 trout, minnow, roach, rudd, dace,     
 chubb, bream and pike. One tale says  
 that there is a crafty old pike in    
 Mill Bay with five hooks in its mouth.
    Hills rise steeply from the valley 
 and one of them,{The Mount,}is a      
 favourite place for sledging in the   
 snow. Children of all ages climb up   
 and run down, and cyclists and        
 motorcyclists try out their stunts.
