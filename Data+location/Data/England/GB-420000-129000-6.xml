		<content> to sell calves. Lunch is from twelve  
 o'clock to one o'clock and is always a
 cooked meal.                          
 Although he sells calves he does not  
 buy any as he breeds his own from his 
 Fresian cows. He has not bought a cow 
 since 1946.                           
 Sales representatives come to see him 
 during the day. There is usually one a
 day. In the afternoon he carries on   
 with the day's job. He comes in for   
 tea at five o'clock. This is bread and
 butter, cakes and a cup of tea.       
 Usually this is with the children. If 
 it is hay time, harvesting or silage  
 cutting time he goes out again after  
 tea. Otherwise there is more paperwork
 and time to relax before going to bed 
 at about eleven o'clock.
