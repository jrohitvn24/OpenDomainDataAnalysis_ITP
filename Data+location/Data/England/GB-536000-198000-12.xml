 11 year olds). There are approximately
{300 pupils}in the school.             
 The school was built in{1968,}although
 this year, 1985 , the building has had
 to be{re-clad and re-furbished}-with a
 new boiler; painted inside and out;   
 carpeting and false ceilings          
 installed in every classroom. The     
 total cost was{Â£400,000.              
 At the present time there are{10      
{classes.}Each class has its own room, 
 where the pupils remain for a year,   
 being taught all the curriculum       
 subjects by the class teacher. But at 
 the end of each year the pupils move  
 on to a different teacher.
