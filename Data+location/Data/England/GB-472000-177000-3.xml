		<content> The central settlement of the area is 
Binfield Heath, which is a scattered   
hamlet divided between the parishes of 
Eye &amp; Dunsden and Shiplake in          
Oxfordshire, which are almost entirely 
agricultural in character. It stands on
one of the south-eastern foothills of  
the Chilterns and is approximately     
contained by the three-hundred-foot    
contour, with a maximum altitude of    
three hundred and thirty seven feet    
above sea-level at the top of Lee Hill 
above Dunsden Green. The view,which    
extends to a skyline of the Hampshire  
hills in the south, embraces the Thames
Valley from beyond Reading in the west 
to Windsor in the east, the Round Tower
of the Castle being visible on a clear 
day from a point near Hampstead Farm   
Cottages at a distance of fourteen     
miles.
