		<title>07THE BMX TRACK</title>
		<content> The BMX track was built in 1983 in a  
 field behind what is now the sports   
 centre in the {West End of Clevedon}. 
 A lot of children had had BMX bikes   
 that year for Christmas or birthday   
 presents. The {Comet}company started a
 club called the {Clevedon Comets }    
 which costs Â£1 and you get a          
 newsletter 4 times ,a membership      
 card,transfers and stickers.There are 
 about 40 people in the club but it    
 should get bigger.                    
 On the track there are 4 speed jumps,6
 berms,a table top,camels and a step   
 down.There is going to be a quarter   
 pipe and a trick ramp at the end of   
 the year.The track is being extended  
 t0 328 metres and 8 people can fit    
 into the starting gate.Tyres are put  
 round the outside for safety. They are
 starting freestyle competitions.
