		<title>15NOTTINGHAM VICTORIA CENTRE</title>
		<content>   Victoria Centre is almost in the    
 middle of town.It is named after the  
 Victoria Station which used to be     
 there.A tunnel led from the station   
 through to the Forest, where there was
 a small station in Carrington which is
 now a sweetshop.Victoria Centre is a  
 large shopping area where people      
 can do their shopping under one roof  
 rather than walking all over town to  
 do it.                                
   Outside the Centre is an old clock  
 tower.It was left there to remind     
 people of the station which was there 
 before.In the Centre are pubs,        
 restaurants, and lots of shops.There  
 is a market which used to be the      
 Central Market in a different part of 
 town before the Centre was built.
