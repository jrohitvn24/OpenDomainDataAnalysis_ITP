		<content> Dartford Heath is an area of general  
heathland existing as part of the Green
Belt. The underlying sands and pebbles 
give rise to an infertile soil         
unsuitable for farming. The southern   
boundary of the heath is now marked by 
the A.2 (T). From here and adjoining   
roads, views of the heath can be seen. 
 Bracken, grass and gorse cover the    
area and give rise in dry weather to   
fire risk. When the gorse is in bloom  
the heath is ablaze with colour. Many  
birds can be seen in the area          
especially the Magpie which can be seen
strutting along the roads and paths    
which criss-cross the heath. This was  
the home of the Dartford Warbler, now  
no longer seen in this area.           
 Part of the heath has been made into  
an 18 hole golf course. The club house 
of Dartford golf club being easily     
accessable from the roads on the heath.</content>
