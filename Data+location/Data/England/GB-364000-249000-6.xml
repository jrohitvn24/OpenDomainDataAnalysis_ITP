		<title>06Rural employment</title>
		<content> The main employment in this area is on
 the land.  Many of the farmers employ 
 some full time workers and also part  
 time workers during the hop tying and 
 hop picking seasons, and during the   
 soft fruit and apple picking seasons. 
 Other farmers run their farmn as a    
 company and all members of the family 
 become involved.  Several residents   
 work elsewhere: these include         
 teachers, shop workers, and an        
 accountant.
