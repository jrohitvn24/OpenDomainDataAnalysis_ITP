		<title>01ARUNDEL AND THE ARUN GAP</title>
		<content> The area north of Arundel comprises,  
 in equal parts, Arundel Park, admin-  
 istered by the Norfolk Estate, and    
 eastward, a deep valley through which 
 winds the river Arun. The park,       
 containing earthworks, and the site of
 a Romana British settlement affords   
 excellent recreation for the public.  
 Eastward of Arundel Park lies Offham  
 and eastward again, across the valley,
 the village of Burpham, built along-  
 side a famous Saxon fort. One         
 kilometre north of Offham lies South  
 Stoke and north of that, North Stoke. 
 each village is accessible only by a  
 narrow cul-de-sac road. Dotted across 
 the landscape are isolated barns,     
 farms and cow-sheds, with woods and   
 copses visible from every angle. Wood-
 land, farmland, chalk-cuttings, river-
 side meadows and open downs offer     
 vast unspoilt views of great beauty.  </content>
