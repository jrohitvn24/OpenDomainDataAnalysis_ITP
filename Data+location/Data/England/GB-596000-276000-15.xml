		<content>In the villages of Market Weston &amp;     
Barningham there is still a pronounced 
Suffolk accent especially amongst the  
older members of the community who were
born &amp; have remained in the area.Even  
though the Norfolk border is so close  
the accents are quite different.Word   
usage is at times different from modern
English with words from old English    
still in use - "housen" for houses;    
"musmidor":a May bug;"hodmedod":snail. 
The word "now" in use repeatedly:"I'm  
now going","she is now coming". The    
sound "h" often appearing before words 
"ain't" being "h'ain't" &amp; seldom drop- 
ped as in the London accent. "Good o'  
bor" thought to derive from "Good      
neighbour" which is still its meaning. 
Sadly much of the usage of Suffolk     
words &amp; dialect is disappearing with   
the influence of TV &amp; radio, also the  
influx of people from out of the area. </content>
