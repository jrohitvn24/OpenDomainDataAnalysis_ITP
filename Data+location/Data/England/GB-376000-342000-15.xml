		<title>15OLD HALL</title>
		<content>                                       
  Old Hall was built in 1550. It has 12
main rooms ( 5 bedrooms, 3 attic rooms 
and 4 main rooms downstairs) and a     
cellar. Mrs.Hugh lives there and she   
also teaches some children in our      
school to play the violin. At the      
moment Mrs Hugh's house is being       
repaired. Mr Smith is taking the front 
of the house down and is using poles to
support the walls. Along the front of  
the house is carved "Walke, knave, what
lookest at?" This was put there in 1647
and it is believed that the owner did  
so because everyone kept staring at    
this lovely black and white building as
they walked past. Another possible ex- 
planation is that King Charles may have
hidden there and did not want to be    
given away by someone staring. The     
house was built to a plan like a cross 
and was originally a farmhouse.        </content>
