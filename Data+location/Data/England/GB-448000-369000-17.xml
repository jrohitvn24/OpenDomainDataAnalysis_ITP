		<content>      Whaley is a small village near   
 the Derbyshire / Nottinghamshire      
 border. It contains 41 houses and     
 bungalows, most of which are stone    
 built. There are three farms in       
 Whaley, one of which is described     
 earlier in the text on page .         
      As well as houses and farms,     
 Whaley contains a church, a garage, a 
 public house and a bus stop, although 
 Whaley no longer has a public         
 transport service.                    
      The only leisure facility, other 
 than the public house, is the         
 recreation ground.
