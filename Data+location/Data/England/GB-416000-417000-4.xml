		<content>{I.C.I}is the biggest chemical firm in 
 the area.From Deigton School we can   
 see many pipes,chimneys,offices and   
 large constructions.The firm employs  
 100's of people and covers about a    
 square mile of land.We often see      
 yellow and red smoke pouring out.{L.B 
{Hollidays}also produce chemicals but  
 the buildings look ordinary and do    
 not take up as much space as the      
 I.C.I.The firms are built next to each
 other along the banks of the River    
 Colne and the Ramsden Canal.The       
 Deighton area is a busy area for      
 industry employing hundreds of        
 people.{Batleys}is a place where you  
 buy things cheaper in bulk for a firm 
 that you own.{Ellis And Booth}sell    
 wood if you went to look there you    
 would see masses of timber.
