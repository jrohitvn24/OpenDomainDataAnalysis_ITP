		<title>13THE WORTH WAY</title>
		<content> The Worth Way is the dismantled       
{railway line}between{Three Bridges}and
{East Grinstead.}It opened in{1855}and 
 closed in{1967.}It is about 8 miles   
 long and had four stations; Three     
 Bridges,{Rowfant, Grange Road (Crawley
{Down)}and East Grinstead, which were  
 built in 1855, except for Grange Road 
 which was built in 1860.              
   The{West Sussex County Council      
 bought most of the line (but not the  
 stations) and in{1976}the route was   
 named Worth Way by{Crawley Down Church
{of England School,}as the result of a 
 competition. The Worth Way is now a   
{linear country park.}It is a{public   
{footpath}and{bridleway}and is linked  
 to the{Forest Way}in{East Sussex.     
   Ponds have been established along it
 which encourage{wildlife.}It is known 
 for the variety of wild{orchids}      
 growing along it.                     </content>
