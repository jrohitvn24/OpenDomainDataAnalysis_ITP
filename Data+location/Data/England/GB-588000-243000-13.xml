		<title>13Gt.Waldingfield School Field</title>
		<content>  The school stands on part of a large 
field which once was used for growing  
corn.The site was intended to house a  
police station and a health clinic as  
well as the school,but these were      
never built.There is a large pond near 
the school.This is fed by land drainage
water and the high nitrogen content of 
the water has caused a large quantity  
of duck weed to grow.Since the school  
was fenced in,for protection,moorhens  
have nested on the pond.The field is   
used by the village football team,who  
have a pavilion.There is also an       
adventure playground with swings,      
slide and climbing frame.The field,    
except for the part where the school   
stands, is administered by the         
community council.
