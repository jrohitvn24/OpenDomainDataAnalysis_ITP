		<title>15SADBERGE PEOPLES JOBS</title>
		<content> I have done a survey of peoples jobs  
 in Sadberge.I know that a few years   
 ago most people lived and worked in   
 the village mainly as farm workers.Now
 because we have better transport      
 people can travel a lot further to    
 their work.I asked all the children in
 the school what their parents jobs    
 were,these are the results.There were 
 forty sets of parents in the survey.I 
 found that the most common job was an 
{office worker (9) then farmers (5) the
 rest of the results were{lorry drivers
{(4) school teachers (3) garage workers
{(3) electricians (3) shop workers (2) 
{bankers (2) public house workers (2)  
{one only jobs were:_agricultural      
{suppliers,dentist,nurse,architect,    
{civil engineer,policeman,builder,gas  
{worker,computer programmer,taxi driver
{and a kennel worker.
