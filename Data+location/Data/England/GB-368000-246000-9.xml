		<title>09Soft Fruit at Leadon Court</title>
		<content>   Mr. Kannreuther has three fields    
 of{blackcurrants.} One field was      
 replanted last year (1984), and these 
 bushes will not be picked until 1987. 
 The bushes fruit for 15 years and then
 the field is rested for 3 years to    
 give the soil time to recover its     
 structure.  The bushes are pruned in  
 spring by hand so that they will be   
 sufficiently uniform to be{picked by  
{machine.}                             
   The blackcurrants are all exported  
 to Holland by lorry as soon as they   
 are picked.  It is important to pick  
 at exactly the right time, since only 
 5% of green currants is allowed, but  
 if the fruit is too ripe the machine  
 crushes it to pulp as it picks.       
   At present, Mr. Kannreuther has     
 difficulty in getting a good price    
 because of competition from Poland.
