		<title>09RAMPTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Rampton is the largest village of this
 local area. It has a church which in  
 part dates from Saxon times, a Post   
 Office, a garage and general stores,  
 and a public house. There is a village
 hall which is used for clubs and local
 functions. There are a number of small
 housing developments, but in the main 
 the houses are old and are sited      
 around what was the village green.    
 There is little opportunity for       
 employment in the village so most     
 people have to travel to work. Several
 mobile shops come into the village    
 including a Fishmonger, Butcher and   
 Chip Van. The surroundings are flat   
 farmland. One enterprise in the       
 village is Pet's Corner which is a    
 large play area which is very popular 
 with children from all over the       
 county.
