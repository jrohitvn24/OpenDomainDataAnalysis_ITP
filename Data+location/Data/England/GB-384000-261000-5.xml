		<title>05Ombersley's Main Roads</title>
		<content>  There are{two main roads}in          
 Ombersley. The A449  leads from       
 Worcester to Kidderminster and is the 
 busiest road. The A4133 leading to    
 Droitwich and Tenbury is the least    
 busy because it connects with smaller 
 towns. The{busiest times}are before   
 9.00am and about 5.00pm when people   
 conmmute to work. Much traffic comes  
 through Ombersley because  it is      
 central to several  large towns and   
 because the{bridge} at nearby Holt is 
 one of the few places to cross the    
 River Severn.                         
  On Bank Holiday the A449 becomes     
 busier because of people travelling   
 from the Midlands joining the M5 at   
 Worcester to go to the seaside.The    
 by-pass was built around Ombersley on 
 the A449 due to traffic jams and      
 because the people did not like the   
 fumes and the noise from the vehicles.</content>
