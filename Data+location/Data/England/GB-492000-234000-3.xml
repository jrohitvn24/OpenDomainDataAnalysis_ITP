 still in use in our area and one that 
 has been converted into a house.      
   The{church of St.James and St.Mary  
{Magdalene,Husborne Crawley,}dates from
 1219 and is of the late Saxon/Norman  
 period.Its tower is unusual for its   
 green sandstone.Christian worship has 
 been on this site for almost 8OO      
 years.The {church of St. Botolph in   
{Aspley Guise}dates from at least 1223 
 but much of the original stonework    
 has been replaced,mainly around 18O6. 
{St.Mary's}Catholic church dates from  
 1955 and has 52O members.It's still   
 building up a tradition but is already
 active in local life.Aspley Guise{    
{Evangelical Free Church}was built in  
 1843 and is in the Square.Finally the 
 old{Methodist Chapel}built in 1813 is
