		<title>09Sponsored Walk, Manningtree</title>
		<content> Each year in the summer term          
 Manningtree school holds a sponsored  
 walk when all the pupils in the school
 and the staff walk to raise money.    
  At first it was alright we started   
 off clean and dry then the weather    
 became very wet sometimes it rained   
 making us drenched. We were also very 
 often near rivers which increased the 
 mud. Sometimes we were up to our knees
 in mud!                               
  We walked to raise money for the     
 swimming pool. We raised about        
 1400 pounds, after walking 10 miles   
 through Dedham, Flatford and back     
 round to the school.                  
 By Rachel, Lyn, Debbie and Fiona.     
 Aged between 12 and 15.
