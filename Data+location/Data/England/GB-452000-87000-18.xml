		<title>18  HAVENSTREET RAILWAY 1</title>
		<content>    The Isle Of Wight central railway  
 company built a station in Havenstreet
 in 1875. This made the village        
 prosper. The land used to belong to   
 John Rilands, a local land owner      
 and his initials are on the side of a 
 workshop. After the railway closed in 
 1966 a preservation group called Wight
 Locomotive Society was formed. Steam  
 engines from the Southern Railway and 
 a private line in Fawley were bought  
 or donated to the society and many    
 original notices and buildings remain.
 Today the trains run every quarter of 
 an hour each Sunday, during the summer
 months and Bank Holidays. In July and 
 August they run every Thursday. It    
 costs Â£150 a day to run because       
 of the cost of coal.
