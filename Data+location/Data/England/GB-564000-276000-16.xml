    THE WEST ROW AREA IS RICH IN       
CERTAIN ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERAL AND     
KEEN-EYED LOCALS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY 
VIGILANT ESPECIALLY AT TIMES OF HIGH   
WINDS, RAIN AND PLOUGHING. MANY OF     
THEIR FINDS ARE DISPLAYED IN THE MUSEUM
AT MILDENHALL.                         
    A FIELD OFF HIGHLAND DROVE, JUST   
BEYOND THE SPEEDWAY STADIUM, IS THE    
SITE OF A DIG BEGUN AFTER DISCOVERIES  
BY A LOCAL ARCHAEOLOGIST. THIS IS A    
BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT SITE AND         
EXCAVATIONS, STARTED IN 1981, ARE      
CONTINUING TODAY,WITH THE INTEREST AND 
CO-OPERATION OF THE LANDOWNER.         
    THE POST-HOLES OF A SMALL, ROUND   
HOUSE WITH A PORCH,HAVE BEEN LOCATED,  
AND OTHER FINDS INCLUDE:PIECES OF      
POTTERY,ARROW-HEADS,KNIVES,FLINT       
-SCRAPERS,BORERS,JET TOGGLES,BEADS     
AND SOME STONE ITEMS.                  </content>
