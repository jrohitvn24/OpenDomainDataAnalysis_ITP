		<content>    Trueloves is a branch of the       
 Shaftesbury Society which offers      
 sheltered accommodation for slightly  
 mentally handicapped young adults. The
 hostel is in a large Victorian house  
 set in several acres of land. At the  
 moment they can offer 12 places for   
 adults whose handicaps do not allow   
 them to live without help.            
    The residents have large shared    
 bedrooms; rooms for TV,records,games, 
 hobbies and social occasions and a    
 pool for supervised swimming.         
    During the day the residents are   
 guided by the staff to keep their     
 rooms and clothes tidy and help with  
 preparing the meals. They also attend 
 a local adult training centre or work 
 in and around the hostel.             
    When we were shown around, Mrs.    
 Hopcraft was very helpful and we could
 feel the very caring atmosphere.      </content>
