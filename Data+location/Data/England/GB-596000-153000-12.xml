		<title>12HOLBEAM WOOD</title>
		<content>    Holbeam Wood is one of the         
 stretches of deciduous woodland to run
 along the valley sides in Throwley.   
   Originally most of this wood was    
 beech, but this has been mainly       
 replaced this century by a natural    
 growth of birch, hazel (abundance)    
 sycamore and oak. Much of this was    
 coppiced about 30 years ago, but has  
 now regrown to its full height.       
    The woodland is in the North Downs 
 Conservation Area. Evenso about 9     
 acres of Holbeam Wood was removed     
 recently to provide more arable land. 
 Most of the larger standard trees have
 preservation orders on them.          
   The wood is a haven for wildlife,   
 especially of woodland flowers. We    
 found several fine specimens of       
 spotted orchid. The ground is carpeted
 by bluebells in the spring. Pheasants 
 are encouraged to breed in the wood.  </content>
