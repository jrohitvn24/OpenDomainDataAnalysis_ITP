		<title>11     STATION HOUSE</title>
		<content> Station House at Ashton-under-Hill is 
 now owned by Mr and Mrs Woodward who  
 moved there in 1975.  The house used  
 to be lived in by the Station Master  
 and the last train ran in about 1945. 
 There used to be a well but it was    
 filled in because Mr and Mrs Woodward 
 had young grandchildren.  They own 7  
 acres of land .  It is mainly rough   
 wasteland and pasture.  The platform  
 remains but all of the rails have been
 pulled up and the waiting rooms were  
 bulldozed down accidentally.  You     
 can see where they went.
