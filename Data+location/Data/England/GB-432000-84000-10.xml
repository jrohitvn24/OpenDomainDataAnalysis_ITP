		<title>10HEADMASTER OF WEST WIGHT</title>
		<content> Mr Toms is headmaster of West Wight   
 Middle School.  He has been a         
 headmaster for 4 years and has been   
 teaching for 18 years.  He would like 
 to see better accoustic conditions,   
 better heating and roofing, more C.D.T
 lessons and more involvement with the 
 community.  Mr Toms' previous jobs    
 were as a builder's labourer, a       
 waiter and an ice-cream seller.  He   
 would like to do things with history, 
 things to do with youth and also      
 something with plants, work in a book 
 or art shop or be a professional      
 tennis player.  Mr Toms likes his job 
 and he went to Carisbrooke Grammar    
 School and to King Alfreds College,   
 Winchester.  There are 19 teachers in 
 the school, 384 children and 46 other 
 people.
