		<title>15Saturday for a Teenager</title>
		<content> It was Saturday and I was going to    
 meet my friends in town.We met by the 
 CO-OP in Countess Wear and caught the 
 bus into town.                        
     We got off the bus at the bus     
 station, walked out through the alley 
 way into Boots. By the time we had    
 finished looking around we were       
 getting a bit hungry so we thought    
 we would go to get something to eat.  
 We thought about where to go and      
 decided on the new pizza place which  
 has just opened in the high street.   
     After that we went down to the    
 Guild Hall to see if they had anything
 going on _ they usally do.            
     In the evening we all met up      
 together and went to the Riverside    
 club.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
