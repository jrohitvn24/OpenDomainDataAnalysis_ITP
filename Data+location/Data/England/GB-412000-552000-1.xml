		<title>01GAZETTEER OF DIPTON.</title>
		<content>  In our block,the vast majority of the
 population live in DIPTON.The village 
 of Dipton is 4 miles N.E.of Consett &amp; 
 is part of the District known as      
 DERWENTSIDE.It is a long, straggling  
 place, on the Northern slope of PONTOP
 PIKE,1,035ft.above sea-level,the      
 highest point in the area.            
   { Since 1955,the PIKE,as it is known
{locally,has been the home of 2        
{different T.V.Transmitters.The new    
{mast which was erected in 1984, is    
{500ft high,making the PIKE a local    
{landmark,for miles around.}           
   At one time, there were 8 pits or   
 collieries, in and around Dipton.Alas,
 they are all worked out.Unemployment  
 is very high in Derwentside,over 25%  
 There are no Industrial Estates in our
 block.
