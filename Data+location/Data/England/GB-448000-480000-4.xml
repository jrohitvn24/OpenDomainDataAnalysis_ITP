		<title>04THE DAY OF A FARMER'S WIFE</title>
		<content> Milking on the farm starts at 6 a.m. I
 rise at 7, wake Steven and Julie and  
 have breakfast. This is followed by   
 some housework after which I make     
 breakfast for my husband and eldest   
 son.The children go to school and my  
 husband back to work.                 
 I am now available to be general      
 factotum on the farm.Collecting eggs  
 is my regular duty, other jobs are    
 seasonal. At haymaking I tip the      
 trailers into the auger and on into   
 the bins, I also work in the barn     
 tipping and placing bales of straw.   
 At 10 o clock my husband and son have 
 a break this is followed by more of   
 the same work on the farm.            
 After dinner there is more            
 housework, particularly cleaning up   
 straw brought inside.At 3 I have half 
 an hour before the children are home  
 and I prepare the evening meal.       </content>
