		<title>13 CLOTHES CHILDREN WEAR</title>
		<content>  I like to wear skirts and blouses    
because you can wear them in a variety 
of ways,unlike dresses.                
  {In the winter} we wear duffle coats,
scarves,wooly hats,gloves and          
wellington boots.{In the summer} we    
wear shorts and T-shirts,cotton        
dresses, swimming costumes or bikinis. 
  Young people today wear clothes which
never spoil their fun.Girls can be as  
active as boys now T-shirts and jeans  
can be worn by anyone.                 
  Our Primary school does not have a   
{school uniform} but our secondary     
school does.The uniform for boys and   
girls is quite similar and includes a  
tie in the school colours.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
