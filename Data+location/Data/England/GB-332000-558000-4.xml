		<content>    Surface  water disposal from the   
 area into the River Eden was, until   
 January 1985, effected by a system of 
 drainage organised and paid for by the
 'Burgh-by-Sands, Beaumont and Orton   
 Drainage Board', to which land        
 occupiers subscribed.                 
    On the above date the              
 responsibility passed to the North    
 West Water Authority because of       
 short-comings in the carrying out of  
 duties by the former board. (S.1.     
 1985/681)                             
    A housewife was absolved from      
 paying drainage charges recently. The 
 decision will affect other people in  
 the area whose properties are         
 connected to cesspits and septic tanks
  for the disposal of effluent.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
