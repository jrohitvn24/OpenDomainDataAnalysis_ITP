		<title>13Royal Hartley Bottle Works</title>
		<content>      In 1763 the Royal Hartley Bottle 
 Works were opened. They were built by 
 Sir Francis Delaval. The first glass  
 house was 200 feet long, 52 feet wide 
 and the walls were 36 feet high. Just 
 after the bottle works were opened Sir
 Francis travelled to Hanover in       
 Germany to obtain some advice on glass
 making. He came back with german      
 employees  to teach the Hartley people
 how to make glass. This is what we    
 call the Hanover connection.          
      Nearby a brickworks was being    
 established to help the bottle        
 workers, but still there was a demand 
 for sandstone which kept the quarrymen
 busy every day. As the industry grew  
 it was decided to extend the premises.
