		<content>   The Bowerhill estate was an RAF camp
 for training airmen in electronics,   
 arms and the instruments of aeroplanes
 from 1938 to 1963.  The Christie      
 Miller Sports Centre was the old      
 gymnasium in which the men exercised. 
 The left-overs from meals went to the 
 piggery which they had.  There was an 
 entrance on the Devizes Road to the   
 camp which now has a barrier across   
 it.  There were no proper houses, just
 rows of wooden huts for the men to    
 live in.  They built married quarters 
 at Berryfields for families to live   
 in.  The hangers were used for actual 
 training.  Until 1938 it was a cookery
 school and then they built the camp.
