		<content> Mostly Mums come to school because    
 Dads are at work. The best time for   
 Dads to come is at night when they see
 our work and talk to teachers or watch
 plays and concerts.Some parents have a
 bad attitude to school because they   
 did not like it when they were little.
 Teachers encourage parents to come to 
 school and they can show them how we  
 learn and then parents can help us.   
 A few schools have a Parent-Teacher   
 Association . The P.T.A. organise     
 events like jumble sales and dances to
 raise money for the School Fund.Our   
 fund buys things like Video Machines  
 and Microcomputers. We have just had  
 our first ever Parent-Governor        
 Elections. Every school now has two   
 Parent Governors. The Headteacher will
 make a report to the Governors every  
 term and they will understand more    
 about the school.                     </content>
