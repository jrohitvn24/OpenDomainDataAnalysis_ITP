		<title>04RIVER RIBBLE, PRESTON</title>
		<content>     Flowing from Ribblehead high in   
 the Pennines,round the E,S and W of   
 Preston, the{Ribble}joins the sea     
 between Southport and Lytham.         
     Famed for{salmon}before pollution 
 from the growth of industry and the   
 Dock,it gave the name to a main road ,
 Fishergate.On 24.6.1768 as many as    
 3,384 salmon and trout were caught. In
 1931 only 200 salmon were recorded.   
 Less industry, and the Dock closure in
 1982, means that the Ribble is again  
 well_known as a Game and Coarse river.
     Six{bridges}go over the Ribble in 
 our block:two railway bridges, one not
 used,the other being the main London- 
 to-Glasgow line.The Tram Bridge is a  
 relic from the old canal system.There 
 are three road bridges:two 18thC.,    
 carrying main roads South and West,   
 and one now a stone footbridge, but as
 the South bridge, of medieval origin. </content>
