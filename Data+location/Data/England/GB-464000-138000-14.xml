 EMPLOYMENT POPULATION EDUCATION       
 I did a graph to see which were the   
 most popular pets.There were cats,    
 dogs,budgies,guineapigs,rabbits,sheep 
 and geese.The most popular were cats  
 there were 20 of them next were dogs  
 and fish and the rest came straggling 
 behind.                               
 Next I did a graph to show how many   
 children were most popular in a       
 family.2 children seemed to be but 3  
 and 4 came close behind.Then I found  
 out how many were boys and how many   
 were girls,there were 36 boys and 39  
 girls.Next I did jobs and put them in 
 to 5 different categories,Recreation, 
 School,Land,Office and Helping        
 Service.The most popular was Land with
 6 people.
