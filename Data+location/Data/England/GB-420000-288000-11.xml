		<content> The Non-Conformists church  was built 
 in 1900.It is now run by the          
 Methodists and Congregationalists     
 church,they joined together 14 years  
 ago and are called{The United Church. 
 To raise money they have jumble       
 sales,coffee mornings and sometimes   
 garden parties.At the harvest there   
 are lots of children as some of the   
 Brownies and Guides come.The vicar    
 asked the children who had brought a  
 gift,probably food or money to        
 bring them forward,the gifts were     
 divided,one third to the world        
 poor,one third to the local poor,and  
 one third to the{United Church Homes. 
 It is a very small church without a   
 spire or bells.It has a little Sunday 
 school held in the back room of the   
 church.The normal services are more   
 for adults than children,it can be a  
 bit boring.                           </content>
