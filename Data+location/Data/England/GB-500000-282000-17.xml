		<title>17WADENHOE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>      With 101 people in 1981, Wadenhoe
 village is quite large compared to    
 most settlements in this area.The main
 industry in the area is farming. The  
 village has a pub, craftshop and a    
 post office where a few villagers also
 work. The pub is a quaint old English 
 pub on the banks of the River Nene    
 where boats are frequently moored.    
 About half of the occupants of        
 Wadenhoe have lived there all their   
 lives. The remainder are new farmers  
 and, as elsewhere in East             
 Northamptonshire, people who have     
 moved from large towns and cities.    
 Most of these use their village       
 cottages as holiday homes and for     
 weekend breaks. Recent plans for      
 a pop festival at Lilford Park were   
 strongly opposed by the residents who 
 were apprehensive of the possible     
 impact of 25,000 pop-fans on Wadenhoe.</content>
