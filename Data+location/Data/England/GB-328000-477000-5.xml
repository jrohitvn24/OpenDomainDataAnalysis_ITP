		<title>05Ulverston Cattle Market</title>
		<content>   Ulverston cattle market was first   
 sited in Lightburn Road in 1877. In   
 1962 it moved to North Lonsdale       
 Terrace. The cattle market is held    
 every{Thursday}and many farmers come  
 from the outlying areas to buy and    
 sell cattle,sheep and pigs. There are 
 3 auctioneers and 3 selling rings.    
 Auctioneering begins at 10.30 am.     
   The cattle market has made Ulverston
 a{busy market town.}Many butchers come
 to the cattle market to collect meat  
 from the slaughter house nearby. There
 are also farming supply shops and     
 banks surrounding the market. Many    
 people go into town before and after  
 they have been to market to visit the 
 shops,market stalls and public houses.
 Many also go to other markets,not just
 Ulverston,some travelling distances of
 up to 60 miles.
