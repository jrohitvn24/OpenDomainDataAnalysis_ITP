		<title>14A tale of two commuters</title>
		<content> My dad works in Leicester and has to  
 drive from Cossington daily. His      
 journey takes him through fields and  
 built up areas.Traffic jams are common
 and in the winter snow drifts can be  
 a problem.As he drives he can smell   
 factory fumes and crisps being fried  
 at Walkers factory.In the fields he   
 can some times smell fertiliser.In the
 summer he enjoys his journey.

 My dad works in the B.U.Its on the    
 outskirts of Leicester.He travels     
 about 6 miles and uses the same route 
 every day.He always goes down Platts  
 Lane,up to the Red Lion pub and then  
 on the A6.He is meant to work 7\ hours
 but he works 10.He leaves at about    
 8:15am and returns at 5:30pm.He enjoys
 driving in to work every day and likes
 living in Cossington because its      
 quiet.By Tom Geary age 10.            </content>
