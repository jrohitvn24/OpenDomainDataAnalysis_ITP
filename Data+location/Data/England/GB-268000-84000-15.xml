		<content> There are 3 granite crosses: at Week  
 Down,nearby Short Cross,and Beetor    
 Cross at Watching-place. Dates are    
 uncertain, but they may have been     
 carved by the earliest Christians     
 7th.-9th.C. Beetor Cross is reputed to
 be where the Celts awaited Saxon      
 invasion, prior to a battle.It is also
 said food was put out here at the time
 of the Plague, and that a gibbet stood
 here. There is a bee-wall, possibly   
 18th.C at Beetor farm ,for holding    
 skeps. A blowing house remains at     
 Outer Down, two mould stones (for     
 molten tin) being incorporated in the 
 wall.There are several ash houses(e.g.
 Nattadon).Ash was removed to reduce   
 risk of fires and for fertiliser. The 
 "Druids well" beside the road at      
 Middlecott is believed to be a        
 butterwell, for cooling butter.
