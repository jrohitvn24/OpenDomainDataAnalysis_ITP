		<content>   Sheerness has 3 main areas, Blue    
 Town (which supposedly gets its name  
 from the amount of blue paint which   
 found its way out of the dockyard),   
 Mile Town and Marine{Town,}which      
 stretches along the sea-front east of 
 the dockyard.                         
   The road names of Marine Town give  
 clues to the period it was built and  
 are a reminder of Sheerness's links   
 with the{armed forces.                
   Names of roads such as Wellesley;   
 Alma and Vincent have famous origins  
 and the{public houses,}Heights of     
 Alma; Hero of Crimea and The Napier   
 are familiar names in history. The    
 Victoria, a feature of the{landscape  
 and known locally as the Glasshouse   
 because of its many windows, is named 
 after the Queen who ruled throughout  
 Marine Town's development.
