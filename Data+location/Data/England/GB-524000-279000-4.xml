		<title>04Farming around Raveley</title>
		<content> The block is almost entirely composed 
 of good arable farmland together with 
 a small area (about 50 acres) of wood 
 land (non-coniferous) known as        
 Wennington Wood, and other small areas
 of woodland around Great Raveley.  The
 land is low-lying, from l8 to 36      
 metres above sea level.  There are    
 three villages, Great Raveley, Little 
 Raveley and Wistow.  The area is      
 extensively farmed and there are l0   
 farms varying in size from 40 to 700  
 acres.  5 are over 200 acres.  The    
 principal crop is wheat which is grown
 on all 10 farms, whilst barley is     
 grown on 7, oil seed rape on 3, oats  
 on one and potatoes on another.  There
 is also livestock in this block but on
 a limited scale.  5 farms have beef   
 cattle, one farm dairy  cattle and one
 farm sheep.
