		<title>16A DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   I get to school at 08:45. I get my  
 dinner ticket and at 08:55 my friend  
 Sarah and I ring the bell.We then wait
 outside our classroom for our teacher 
 to say we can enter. While we get on  
 with unfinished work or reading, Mr   
 Summers marks the register and finds  
 out who is staying for dinners or     
 having packed lunch or going home.Then
 Sarah and I have to ring the bell for 
 assembly.After assembly each group is 
 given their work for the morning.This 
 might be Maths,E.R.I.C.(Enjoyable     
 Reading In Class),Individual Topic,   
 Art or Science. After a certain time  
 the groups change over to do different
 work.At noon we have lunch. The       
 afternoon is similar to the mornings  
 but we also have Music,Games or       
 Swimming.At 15:00 we usually listen to
 a story and at 15:30 we ring the home 
 bell.                                 </content>
