		<content> Marbles: here are two games -         
 SMACKS - you need two or more players 
 . The first person rolls their marble 
 and the other person has got to try   
 and smack it. If he smacks the first  
 person's marble he has won.           
 HOLES - once again you need two people
 to pkay. The first person tries to get
 her marble in the hole the other      
 person would probably put his marble  
 far away from the hole. The person    
 whose marble is nearest to the hole   
 can take another go if he gets it in  
 the hole he has won.                  
 Other games which we play -           
 hopscotch, climbing frame, stoolball, 
 foorball, rounders, cricket and catch.
