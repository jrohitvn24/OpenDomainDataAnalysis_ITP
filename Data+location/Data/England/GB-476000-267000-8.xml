		<title>08The farming year</title>
		<content>   In{September and November}the local 
 arable farmer prepares his land with  
 the plough and the cultivator.When    
 this has been completed, he is able to
 sow seed for the rape, barley and     
 wheat crops.                          
  {December and January}are mainly     
 devoted to the maintenance of         
 buildings and machinery.Ditches,      
 hedges and drains also receive any    
 necessary attention.                  
   From{March to June,}the growing     
 crops are sprayed against diseases and
 fertilisers are added to the land.    
   The months of{July and August}are   
 very busy for the farmer as this is   
 the time for harvesting the crops of  
 oil-seed rape, barley, peas, wheat and
 lupin.                                
   Immediately after harvest, ploughing
 begins and a new farming year is      
 underway.                             </content>
