		<title>03Carlton Feast</title>
		<content> Carlton Feast probably started as a   
 Goose Fair in the Middle Ages.Everyone
 who went would most likely sit down to
 a meal.Animals would be sold and other
 objects.But as the years have passed  
 the Goose Fair has developed into     
 Carlton's Annual Feast,with a Queen   
 being the main attraction along with a
 competition for the best float made by
 Cubs,Brownies,Guides or the W.I.In    
 years gone by the float themes have   
 been Television Programmes,           
 Personalities and the Wild West etc.  
 The Queens who are chosen at the local
 pantomime receive the crown from the  
 past Queen.The Feast is on the        
 Saturday closest to Midsummer's       
 Day.This is probably because the      
 Goose Fair  was held to celebrate     
 Midsummer.It takes place in Carlton   
 Tower's Grounds and is usually opened 
 by a well known villager.             </content>
