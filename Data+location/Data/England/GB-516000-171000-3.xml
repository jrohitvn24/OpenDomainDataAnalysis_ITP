		<title>03HAM HOUSE</title>
		<content>  {Ham House}is situated at the end of 
 Ham Street, beside the river. It was  
 built in 1610 for Elizabeth, Countess 
 of Dysart and Duchess of Lauderdale.  
 After the Dysarts the Tollemache      
 family lived in Ham House. The        
 family remained there until 1948 when 
 their properties in Ham and Petersham 
 were sold by auction. Ham House with  
 its grounds   were given to the       
 National Trust and the contents were  
 bought by the government for the      
 Victoria and Albert Museum. It is now 
 furnished and decorated entirely in   
 17th.Century works, many of them      
 original to Ham House. Now Ham House  
 is open to the public for tours and   
 visits. The riverside gardens of Ham  
 House are still looked after and are  
 beautiful in the summer in full bloom.
