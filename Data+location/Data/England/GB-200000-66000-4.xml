		<title>04AN INSTRUMENT MAKER'S DAY</title>
		<content> I leave the tranquil serenity of      
 Nanstallon to work in a factory,which 
 is in the forefront of today's        
 technology.My day begins at 7a.m.that 
 is the time I get up.I wash and dress 
 and by 7:40 I am ready to leave for   
 work.I never have breakfast.I drive 2 
 miles to the factory,situated on the  
 outskirts of Bodmin,where I work.The  
 firm manufactures electronic and      
 microwave instruments from raw        
 materials.These are used in           
{Telecommunications,Radar and Defence  
{Systems.}My job is to assemble all the
 many components into a working        
 instrument.I have a half hour for     
 lunch break when I eat my sandwiches. 
 My working day ends at 6p.m.When I get
 home I have my main daily meal.I go to
 bed at about 11p.m.In the village     
 district,there is a builder,a plumber,
 a car mechanic and a carpenter.       </content>
