		<title>01GOXHILL &amp; ITS ENVIRONS.</title>
		<content> Goxhill is 2 km south of the Humber   
 estuary opposite Hull where the river 
 bends towards the sea. The landscape  
 is flat. The village is isolated as   
 only two roads lead from it to        
 neighbouring villages. Goxhill is an  
 elongated village - North and South   
 Ends, as they are known, being over   
 2km apart. New housing has been       
 developed on a small scale at both    
 extremities of the village and there  
 has been some infilling. In recent    
 years the population has grown with   
 many people employed in the fertilizer
 and petro-chemical industies on the   
 Humber Bank. Families from north of   
 the river have moved to Goxhill as the
 opening of the Humber Bridge, in 1981,
 made access easier to Hull. Goxhill's 
 cheaper property and pleasant         
 environment is also an attraction.
