		<title>03  RIPON PARKS</title>
		<content> This covers South,Middle and North    
 Parks farms,which are owned by Ripon  
 Council. Middle and South Parks are   
 rented to tenant farmers, and North   
 Parks to the Ministry of Defence,who  
 relet it as a farm, but use some of   
 the fields for Territorial Army camps.
   There is a public right of way which
 starts at Ripon Golf Club passing     
 through all the Parks farms.          
   Ripon Parks was once the hunting    
 park of the Archbishops of York,and   
 Middle Parks farmhouse was the hunting
 lodge.There is still a room there that
 used to be the chapel,but it is in a  
 very dilapidated state.               
   The Staveley family were the wardens
 of the hunting Parks when{Cardinal    
{Wolsey,}who died in 1530, was         
 Archbishop of York.
