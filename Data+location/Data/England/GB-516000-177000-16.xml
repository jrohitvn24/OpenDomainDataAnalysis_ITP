		<title>16THE M4/ROAD SYSTEMS</title>
		<content> The M4 is one of the busiest motorways
 approaching London.The road carries   
 traffic from the west e.g. Bristol and
 Newport. Its location is very         
 important as it runs parallel to      
 Heathrow Airport, which is about eight
 miles from the end of the Motorway in 
 Chiswick. This aspect is quite an     
 important factor as there are many    
 commercial interests using the airport
 as a base, therefore they need fast   
 and easy access.                      
                                       
 There is an ever-increasing volume of 
 traffic using this route and as a     
 consequence there is often a very     
 heavy build-up of traffic entering    
 central London. Chiswick boasts one of
 the busiest intersections in Europe   
 - not something the local residents   
 are proud of though.
