		<title>14Women's Cricket in Colwall</title>
		<content>  Colwall is the birthplace of the     
{Women's Cricket Association}and every 
 August some 140 of England's best     
 women cricketers merge on the village 
 for a unique week-long competition,   
 playing matches on the grounds of     
 local schools and clubs. It all began 
 in 1936 when Mrs Scott-Bowden, a      
 member of the women's Hereford West   
 cricket team, proposed a women's      
 cricket match in the village. Later   
 that year the Women's Cricket         
 Association was set up at a meeting in
 London. It was decided that players   
 from the various clubs in the country 
 should meet in one place, Colwall, and
 that the players should be put up at  
 private houses in the village. Thus   
 began the Cricket Week, and each year 
 a committee picks 12 equal teams for  
 a tournament in which each team plays 
 all the others.                       </content>
