		<title>07Shopping Survey in Clive</title>
		<content> Residents of Clive were asked to      
 answer questions about where they went
 to do their shopping.                 
 Many people, especially the older     
 residents, said they shopped for their
 daily needs such as bread , fruit     
 and vegetables, at the village shop   
 in Clive. Some older people shopped   
 exclusively at this shop. Many people 
 said they went to large supermarkets  
 in Shrewsbury or Whitchurch for items 
 of food that would keep for a longer  
 time. Other people shopped regularly  
 in Wem for groceries.   Furniture and 
 clothes were not bought very often but
 if they were, it was from small stores
 in Wem or larger stores in Shrewsbury 
 or Telford or even from cities as far 
 away as Chester, Wolverhampton or     
 Birmingham. Everybody appreciated the 
 village shop as it was so convenient  
 although it was more expensive.       </content>
