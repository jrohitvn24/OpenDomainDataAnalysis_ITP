		<content>As there is no community hall in the   
area, the only entertainment is to be  
found in the local Inn, which has music
on one evening each week.  The Inn is a
clearing house for all local gossip,   
news and farming talk.  The meeting    
place is in the adjoining block it is  
the local Village Hall, it is widely   
used by members living in this block.  
There is a Gardening Club, Scouts and  
Guides, Women's Institute and many     
other groups using the hall for money  
raising events such as Coffee          
Evenings, Garden Shows, Autumn and     
Summer Fairs and Dances. The owners of 
Sugnall Hall also allow generous use   
of their home for entertainment of     
this kind for the benefit of the local 
communities. There is a Riding School  
which offers facilities for riding,    
riding instruction and ensures good    
use of the Bridleways.                 </content>
