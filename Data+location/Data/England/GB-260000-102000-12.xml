		<title>12The Churches in Exbourne</title>
		<content> There are now two Churches in the     
 village.The Parish Church of St.Mary  
 has been in existance since at least  
 1266,it can be found in the adjoining 
 block,ref.02600099.                   
 There are Norman features visible in  
 the stonework.The pew ends and rood   
 screen are richly carved.The barrel   
 roof of both nave and chancel have    
 carved bosses. Although the Parish    
 Church is still an important part of  
 village life,it is not as well        
 attended as it was formerly.          
 The Methodist Chapel was built in 1932
 to replace a smaller one which is now 
 a house.The Chapel is part of the     
 Hatherleigh circuit.                  
 The Chapel still sees a good          
 attendance,a smaller number than there
 used to be,though.
