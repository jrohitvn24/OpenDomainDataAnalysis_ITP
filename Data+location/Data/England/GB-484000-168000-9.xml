		<title>09The Binfield Quilters</title>
		<content>  The {Binfield Quilters}are a group of
 ladies who make patchwork quilts. They
 meet in the{Baxter Room }of{St.Mark's 
{Church}on the first Wednesday of every
 month except in summer.               
   In 1982 they persuaded 16 ladies to 
 make a material{collage and embroidery
 of their own home. The Quilters made  
 their quilt by sandwiching three      
 layers together. The first layer was  
 plain cotton material.The second layer
 was a thick padded layer,which keeps  
 you warm.The third layer was the      
 patterned layer,in this case the house
 pictures. They sewed the pictures     
 together with a maroon flower         
 patterned border.The quilt was        
 finished with a plain maroon edge.    
   The Binfield Quilters exhibit the   
 quilt at Craft Shows and are looking  
 for a permanent home for it.
