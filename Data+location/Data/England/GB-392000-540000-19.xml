       Very often during the holidays, 
 especially on Thursdays, the          
 pony riders come up through part of   
 the village and they go past the      
 school. In the summer hikers come as  
 well.                                 
       The hikers stop at the pub for a
 drink and some crisps; they sit in the
 car-park on the benches.              
       Bikers ride up to the pub too;  
 they stop for a drink and some crisps.
       The lady who lives in the pub   
 makes sandwiches for the bikers and   
 the hikers.                           
       Caravanners stay at the Nursery 
 Garden throughout the year. The site  
 is better suited to static caravans   
 rather than tourers.
