		<content> CHANGES SINCE 1945,WORSLEY            
   During this time many more houses   
 have been built in the area.Roads like
 Maple Grove,Duchy Avenue and Bedford  
 Avenue were open fields.The linear    
 parkway was a busy railway line with  
 steam trains running on it.People     
 burnt coal in their homes on open     
 fires so the atmosphere was much      
 dirtier.                              
        Mesne Lea and James Brindley   
 Primary Schools have been built to    
 cater for the increased number of     
 children in the area.St. George's High
 School has also been built.The old St.
 Paul's Primary School opposite the new
 library has been demolished and moved 
 to another site.                      
     A new Worsley Pool has been built 
 and the old one made into two teaching
 pools.Worsley Town Hall is now used by
 N.W.Regional advisory College.        </content>
