		<title>18The Water Maze, Bristol</title>
		<content> In Victoria Park, there is a water    
 maze, which was copied from a         
 roof-boss in St. Mary Redcliffe       
 Church.  It was built by Avon County  
 Conservation and Environmental Scheme 
 and opened on Monday 22nd October,    
 l984.                                 
 It was built to show that in both the 
 12th and 20th centuries, the people of
 Bristol realised they needed clean    
 water.                                
 The maze marks the spot where the 12th
 century Redcliffe Pipe, which carried 
 fresh water from Knowle to Redcliffe  
 Church, and the 20th century Southern 
 Foul Water Interceptor Tunnel,        
 carrying sewage to Avonmouth to be    
 treated, meet.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
