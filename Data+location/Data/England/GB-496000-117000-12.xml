		<title>12 - TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> The area is badly served by public    
 transport being rural and unprofitably
 underpopulated.                       
 Train services were withdrawn in the  
 1950s and Bus services are petering   
 out in the early 1980s.               
 The nearest southern railway station  
 is at Pulborough from which trains run
 to London and Chichester or Bognor    
 Regis quite frequently.               
 A minibus service operates on a       
 regular basis for the over 60's.      
 Other intermittent minibus services   
 run to Petworth and Chichester.       
 The local garage does some taxi work, 
 usually taking people to Gatwick or   
 Heathrow airport, but does not run a  
 regular local taxi service as such.   
 In the summer, a special rambler bus, 
 the 222 runs around a circular route  
 from Arundel stopping on demand       
 anywhere on the route.                </content>
