 Farming in the area is mainly arable  
 on fertile fen land,consisting of     
 heavy clay,light loam,silt and black  
 commons land.Artificial fertiliser and
 chemical sprays are widely used to    
 give improved yields.Crops grown are  
 wheat,barley,oats(cereals)potatoes and
 sugarbeet(root crops).Farmers have    
 recently started growing oil seed rape
 which is proving successful.Some may  
 grow seeds or hay to feed their stock,
 a few rear and fatten calves.There is 
 a very famous herd of Lincoln Red     
 Cattle which produces prizewinning    
 show beasts.Many of these calves and  
 bulls are exported to many countries. 
 Size of farms varies enormously;      
 several are rented by farmers from    
 Lincolnshire County Council;these     
 smallholdings are about 75 acres,size 
 of the land varies with owners.       </content>
