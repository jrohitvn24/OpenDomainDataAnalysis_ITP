		<content>{STRANG RIDING CENTRE}-opened in 1977, 
 this is a registered                  
 charity which caters for both the     
{mentally and physically handicapped,  
 teaching them to ride for both        
 pleasure and exercise.  Riding helps  
 disabled people as it assists         
 circulation, co-ordination and        
 strengthens their muscles.  About 20  
 riders can be catered for at one time.
 These people come from{Tyne &amp; Wear,   
{Durham and Northumberland.}  Depending
 on the degree of disability, up to 3  
 helpers per disabled person may be    
 needed.  Every year at least{Â£15,000  
 is needed to run the centre.  Most of 
 this has to be raised, but it is      
 partly financed by the{Manpower       
{Services Commission. }25% of the staff
 come from the M.S.C. but the rest are 
 volunteers.  There is also a bridleway
 on which the riders can practise.     </content>
