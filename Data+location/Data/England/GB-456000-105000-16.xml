		<content>          Fareham town remained a small
 provincial town until the nineteen    
 fifties primarily because it was      
 hemmed in by large private landowners.
 The main three were forced by death   
 duties in the early fifties to sell   
 some of their land.This was bought by 
 builders and the town has more than   
 doubled in size since that time.      
          A housing map of the town    
 would show three distinct sections.   
 The oldest section would be the town  
 itself.Then in the early nineteen     
 hundreds large council housing estates
 were built to the south of the        
 town.Since nineteen fifty the town has
 expanded to the north ,west and       
 east.Green belt land has kept building
 within certain bounds,the M27 being   
 the northern boundary at the moment.
