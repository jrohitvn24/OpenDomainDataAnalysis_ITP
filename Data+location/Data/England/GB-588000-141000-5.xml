		<content> The area has a clay sub-soil with odd 
 outcrops of sand and many ponds. The  
 river Beult, with its willows and     
 water lilies, looks attractive but    
 produces severe floods every 20 years 
 or so. The flood of January 1985 was  
 disastrous for houses in Water Lane   
 and The Street and for the Chequers   
 when the underground drain was blocked
 by lumps of ice, causing the river to 
 back-up and devastate the area, in    
 spite of firemen working the pumps all
 night. Dering Wood is a large area of 
 badly neglected woodland with rides   
 overgrown and swampy paths where      
 rhododendrons sprawl around. It is    
 privately owned but crossed by a      
 public footpath, one of many in the   
 area. The County Council should keep  
 these clear and marked but this they  
 often fail to do. A local footpath    
 group tries to preserve this amenity. </content>
