		<title>12River Alne at Little Alne</title>
		<content>    I measured the depth of the River  
 Alne in July 1985,at the bottom of    
 the field of Holyoake house.The       
 average depth at the edge was 26cm,in 
 the middle 19cm.We had floods in the  
 autumn and March.When it floods and   
 dies down there are hardly any shrimps
 at the edge of the river.This is      
 because the fast flowing current      
 carries them away.On the river or in  
 it are lots of creatures,so I did a   
 bit of surveying on the river.I       
 found-House Martins,Female Mallards,  
 Male Shrimps,Trout and a Moorhen.In   
 the summer it is very good for trout  
 fishing.
