		<title>02Wildlife on the South Downs</title>
		<content> The South Downs is filled with unusual
 wildlife. The Downs are made of Chalk 
 which provides a good home for rabbits
 and small rodents, such as mice.      
                                       
 The insects found on the Downs reflect
 the richness of plant life. The two   
 commonest butterflies are the Small   
 Heath and Common Blue,although their  
 numbers have been declining in recent 
 years. Grasshoppers are abundant,the  
 most common being the Striped _ Winged
 Grasshopper.                          
                                       
 In the air blackbirds,wrens,          
 yellowhammers,chaffinches and robins  
 are common. Cuckoos are also common   
 and skylarks are typical downland     
 birds. The only bird of prey seen     
 frequently is the kestrel.
