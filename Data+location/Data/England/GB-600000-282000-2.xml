		<title>02Small Farm, North Lopham</title>
		<content>      There are many small farms in our
 area.  One example is in North        
 Lopham, on the road to East Harling.  
 The owners are Mr. and Mrs. Callow,   
 who have owned the farm for seventeen 
 years.  They work the farm themselves,
 with only casual workers to help with 
 harvesting and lifting potatoes.  They
 farm 26 acres, some of it owned and   
 some of it rented.  They farm it very 
 intensively.                          
                                       
      The Callows enjoy living and     
 working in North Lopham.  They say    
 working on a small farm is hard, but  
 rewarding work.  You need to be       
 prepared to work all hours, but they  
 are content.  They hope to buy more   
 land to make their farm bigger and    
 also hope to pass it on to their twin 
 boys, now aged 13. (See also page 3)
