		<content> Increased mechanisation &amp; a decrease  
 in stock-farming has reduced agricult-
 ural work in the parishes,eg.there are
 4 farmers &amp; 8 farmworkers in Bedingham
 now compared with 6 &amp; 37 respectively 
 in 1881.However the small businesses  
 provide self-employment &amp; eg.the vil- 
 lage shop employs 1 other person.     
 About 26% find work in the area,as    
 against near 100% in 1881.Of those who
 commute,24% work for big firms such as
 Clay's the Bungay printers,Norwich    
 Union Insurance Co.,Mackintosh of     
 Norwich,Crane Fruehauf &amp; R.G.Carter   
 builder.As this is East Anglia 2 men  
 in the oil industry is not surprising.
 Nearly 20% are professional people,in-
 cluding a GP, actuary, teachers, a    
 librarian &amp; nurse.Smallholders also   
 gain income from other more lucrative 
 sources.30% of the population is      
 retired or widowed,only 5% unemployed.</content>
