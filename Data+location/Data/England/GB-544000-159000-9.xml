		<title>09 FOOTPATHS - COUNTRY WALKS</title>
		<content>  {The London Borough of Bromley} has  
over 100 miles of public footpaths and 
bridleways. The Council has erected a  
sign at the start of almost every one  
of them. Local groups, such as, the    
{Environment Bromley} group work to    
keep them free of overgrowth and litter
as well as erecting waymarks to guide  
the walker and publishing a map of all 
the paths and booklets of suggested    
walks.                                 
  The area covered by this block lies  
at the centre of the most popular walks
and many people visit the villages of  
Cudham and Downe each weekend to enjoy 
walking in the countryside and         
partaking in refreshments at the local 
pubs or village hall teas.  Village    
teas complete with home-made cakes are 
popular with walkers and are often     
provided by local groups as part of    
their fund-raising activities.         </content>
