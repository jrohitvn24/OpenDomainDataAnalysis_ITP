		<title>11CAPENHURST SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> Local residents are reasonably happy  
 with life but have the following      
 worries:Increased urbanisation-the    
 area is Green Belt land between       
 Chester and Ellesmere Port and        
 builders are constantly attempting to 
 acquire more land.this leads to       
 increased vandalism on farmland by    
 people who often don't realise the    
 damage they are doing nor even        
 care.Road Safety-the narrow,often     
 unlit &amp; unpavemented country roads    
 were not built for the increased      
 traffic from BNFL.There is no speed   
 restriction on traffic.Transport-     
 Capenhurst has no bus service or local
 shop.A bus,even if only on Saturdays  
 would help residents reach the        
 shopping and recreational centres.    
 Pollution-Fumes from industrial       
 Ellesmere Port &amp; Stanlow cause        
 concern.                              </content>
