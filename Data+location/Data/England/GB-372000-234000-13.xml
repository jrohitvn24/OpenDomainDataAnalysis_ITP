		<title>13A Look At The Houses.</title>
		<content> The houses on the Bromesberrow and    
 Eastnor estates are tenanted or are   
 tied houses and are supervised by     
 agents/housing managers. Other houses 
 are owner occupied, but there are a   
 few council houses. Some houses, barns
 and stables have been rebuilt or      
 converted for residential use. No new 
 houses have been built,(other than    
 council houses), for a hundred years. 
 The houses vary in age, some are five 
 hundred years old. They are built of  
 wattle and daub, half timbered and/or 
 thatched or of local stone or brick.  
 Most of the houses are connected to a 
 mains water supply, but several homes 
 are still fed by springs or wells.    
 There are a few houses that do not    
 have mains electricity. We found that 
 some generate their own or have a     
 reserve generator for emergencies.    
 Many houses still use septic tanks.   </content>
