		<content>   In June 1966, some people called    
 a public meeting to see if there was  
 enough support for a sports club.     
 There was. The town council let the   
 new club rent the Bowen's Field ground
 and also let them rent the recreation 
 ground. At Bowen's Field there is a   
 football pitch,a hockey pitch,a hard  
 surface with netting and floodlights  
 for evening activities like 5 a side  
 football. A bowling green is now being
 built. There is a swimming pool that  
 was looked after by the Sports and    
 Social club but it was too expensive  
 to run so the North Shropshire        
 District Council now run it. In 1979  
 they built a clubhouse and it is open 
 from 8 till 11 nightly. The clubroom  
 is also  used by groups like an       
 aerobics course and a pre_school      
 group. The rec. has a football pitch  
 that can be rented for Â£6.50 a match. </content>
