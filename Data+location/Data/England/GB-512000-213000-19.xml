		<title>19Harpenden Brownies &amp; Guides</title>
		<content> We are in the 2nd Harpenden Brownies. 
 We meet in the Guide Hut in Townsend  
 Road. Our Brown Owl is Mrs Towner. We 
 meet on a Friday and the Guides meet  
 after us. We have a lot of fun.  This 
 year is a special year for us. The    
 Brownie and Guide movement is 75 years
 old. We have been celebrating in many 
 different ways.  We have made         
 collections of 75 different things    
 which could fit into a camera film    
 box. We had a Guide week in June.  The
 flame was brought to Harpenden by     
 helicopter and we had a procession    
 through the High Street to Rothamsted 
 Park where we stayed for a party. On  
 Saturday we had a grand Carnival in   
 Redbourn when Brownies and Guides from
 all over Hertfordshire met together   
 for a day of activities, fun and      
 enjoyment. It was a day to remember   
 for the rest of our lives.            </content>
