		<title>17Holbeach Bank School Events.</title>
		<content> The first day I went to Holbeach Bank 
 School it was 5th November and there  
 was a bonfire party that night. About 
 100 people went. There was a bonfire  
 in a big oil drum in the middle of    
 the playground. Lots of people brought
 fireworks and it took all evening to  
 let them off. There was a barbecue    
 where people  were cooking sausages   
 and beefburgers. Inside you could     
 buy soup, jacket potatoes and drinks. 
   The spring fair at school was held  
 in May. It was opened by Emma Neve who
 was the May Queen. After that there   
 was Maypole dancing by the children.  
 Emma was presented with a bouquet by  
 the youngest child in the school,     
 Allison Hyde. After the dancing there 
 were toys and books and household     
 items for sale. There were games to   
 play and refreshments to eat. The     
 money was used to buy P.E. equipment. </content>
