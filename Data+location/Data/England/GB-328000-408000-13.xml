		<title>13Moss farming near Formby (1)</title>
		<content> There are many farms to the east of   
 the A565, including{North Moss Farm,  
 which has cattle and sheep, and       
{Headbolt Farm,}which combines dairy   
 and arable farming.                   
 The work of a farmer in the 1980's    
 involves long hours and hard work. For
 example, in the Spring a cattle farmer
 may rise at 6am., and by 9am when he  
 eats breakfast, he has already checked
 and fed his livestock, called the vet 
 and ordered any supplies. The rest of 
 the morning is taken up with attending
 to any medical problems and feeding   
 orphaned animals.                     
 The afternoon may be taken up with    
 cleaning out farm buildings and       
 putting in clean bedding. After       
 dinner, at about 7pm, he does his     
 final check on the animals and        
 buildings.                            
                                       </content>
