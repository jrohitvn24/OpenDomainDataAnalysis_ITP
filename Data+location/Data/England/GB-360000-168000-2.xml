		<content> There are two parks in{Stockwood,}one 
 behind{Burnbush school}has a BMX track
 that was recently built. Not many use 
 it now because the latest interest is 
 Break dancing. The park also is       
 covered by broken glass, tin cans and 
 rubbish. The playground apparatus is  
 broken. The roundabout is falling to  
 bits, the swings are all tied up on   
 the top bar. The local public house is
 called The Antelope. There is also a  
 new library and three Chinese         
 take-away shops.{Saint Silas,}the     
 Boy's club, has its own outdoor       
 five-a-side football pitch with flood 
 lights, all provided by voluntary     
 means. Now it is in poor condition    
 with a lot of rubbish about. There is 
 also an annual carnival where the     
 entrance fee is 10p. for children and 
 20p. for adults.
