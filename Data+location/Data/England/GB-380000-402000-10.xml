		<title>10SYNAGOGUES NEAR PRESTWICH</title>
		<content> The area has many such houses of      
 worship.A typical building will have a
 mens' section downstairs and a ladies'
 gallery above.The services are held   
 three times a day but the biggest     
 attendance is on the{Sabbath}and      
 festivals,when large congregations    
 have a {Cantor}with a choir and others
 have laymen taking the services.      
  In the front, is the Ark a cupboard  
 containing the {Holy Scrolls},draped  
 with velvet and adorned with silver,  
 from which the {Cantor}reads a weekly 
 portion. {Synagogues}often hold youth 
 clubs in the adjoining rooms.A hall is
 attached to the {Synagogue}which can  
 be hired for functions.Funds are      
 raised to support its upkeep.Weekly   
 lectures are given and on the{Sabbath}
 the {Rabbi}gives a sermon.
