		<title>10THE BOYS' BRIGADE-HEDNESFORD</title>
		<content>  The Boys' Brigade was founded by a   
Scotsman, William Alexander Smith, in  
1883 and it is now a worldwide         
organisation for boys with many        
international members providing        
recreation while promoting             
self-discipline and Christianity.      
  I am a member of the 1st Hednesford  
Company. On Tuesday I go swimming at   
Cannock Baths and on Wednesday I go to 
Parade Night at Trinity Methodist      
Church Hall. Here we pay 25p subs.,    
start by doing drill (The Boys' Brigade
is quite military - there are          
promotions - I am a Lance Corporal),   
after this there are classes of first  
aid, safety, birdwatching, survival    
etc. On Thursday there is a band       
practice for drums and bugles. The     
uniform is navy blue.                  
  Our annual camp, usually a week in   
Wales, costs 30 pounds.                </content>
