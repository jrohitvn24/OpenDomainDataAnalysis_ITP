		<title>03         Farming</title>
		<content> The farming in the area is mixed,     
 arable with some pasture land for     
{sheep}and{cattle.}The crops grown are 
{sugar beet, oil seed rape, wheat,}and 
{potatoes.}Life on the farms is very   
 different from the nineteenth century 
 when children took time off school to 
 help with the harvest. To stop this a 
{"never absent" board,}which hangs in  
 the new school, encouraged the        
 children to attend all year. Those who
 did, received{five shillings.         
  {A farmer's wife}today gives more    
 help with the running of the office   
 business, keeping the books, dealing  
 with telephone messages and the vast  
 amount of paperwork. Old farm houses  
 are still more difficult to keep clean
 but modern labour saving gadgets make 
 it easier. Farm produced{meat,        
{vegetables}and{fruit}go into a deep   
 freezer.                              </content>
