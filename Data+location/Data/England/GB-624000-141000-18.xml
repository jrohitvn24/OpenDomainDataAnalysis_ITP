		<title>18ALKHAM  VILLAGE CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The flint stone church of Alkham with 
 its square bell tower commands a      
 prominent position in the village.It  
 is situated on high ground on the side
 of the valley.The steep,narrow road   
 leading up to the lych-gate takes you 
 past the old school buildings on your 
 right and the Marquis Of Granby,the   
 village public house on your left.The 
 church owes  its title "The Church Of 
 St.Antonius of Pamiers" or "St.Anthony
 The Martyr"to the influence of the    
 Abbot of St.Radigunds Abbey who was   
 granted the parish as a gift in the   
 13th century.                         
 Today Alkham church shares a vicar    
 with the parishes of St.Mary's and St.
 Radigund's in Capel-le-Ferne and      
 St.Laurence in Capel.Only one service 
 a week is held in Alkham church but it
 is still at the centre of much village
 life.                                 </content>
