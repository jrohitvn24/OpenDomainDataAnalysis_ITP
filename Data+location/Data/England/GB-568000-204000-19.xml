		<title>19FISHING IN CHELMSFORD</title>
		<content> We are Andrew Layton and Lee Kirk;we  
 attend Trinity Road Primary School.Our
 favourite pastime is fishing;it is one
 of the{most popular pastimes}in the   
 country.                              
 We go fishing at{the Weir}on the River
 Chelmer,upstream from Victoria Road.We
 also fish in{the lake in Central Park.
 We have caught roach,perch,tench,dace,
 gudgeon,minnow and chub in these      
 waters.All the fish take maggot bait  
 except the tench which take sweetcorn.
{We use}stainless steel and bronze     
 hooks in sizes 2 to 24,nylon lines and
 glass fibre or carbon fibre rods,with 
 a float to support the tackle in the  
 water. If we were pike fishing we     
 would use a spinning lure or a heavy  
 pike float and wire trace before the  
 hook.{We go fishing 4-5 times a week  
 and would like to go fly fishing one  
 day at the Hanningfield Reservoir.    </content>
