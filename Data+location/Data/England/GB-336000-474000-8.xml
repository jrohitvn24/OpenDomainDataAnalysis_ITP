		<content>   The site of the Nursery was a field 
 called Bowridge.The Taylor family have
 lived here since 1924 and the Nursery 
 was started in 1947.                  
   It covers an area of about one acre 
 and is mostly covered in glass houses.
 Large oil burners are used to heat the
 nursery, especially in winter.In the  
 summer the wasps and bees are allowed 
 to fly in and out.                    
   Over 2000 plants are sold each week.
 Some are grown from seed, others are  
 brought in as young plants from other 
 nurseries in Britain or overseas.Cut  
 flowers are also sold as bouquets,    
 sprays or as arrangements for hotels  
 and functions.                        
   The Taylor family have seven people 
 working in the Nursery or in their    
 small Cafe next door.                 
   The Nursery may be expanded and     
 improved in the near future.          </content>
