		<content>{LOCAL HISTORY}The enclosure of        
 Leverton was completed in 1795 after  
 many arguments. The parishes of       
 Leverton and Habblesthorpe being      
 inter-mixed and division made more    
 difficult by church lands. The infield
 system of fields was also associated  
 with 28 named strips which were in    
 great demand. There has never been a  
 Lord of the Manor in the accepted     
 sense. The modern  field system       
 resembles the original open fields of 
 800 years ago. In the original        
 Domesday book North Legreton was      
 a part of the Soke of Laneham given by
 the king to the Arch Bishop of York.  
 Church dates from 1180 Habblethorpe   
 church is now a ruin. Windmill was    
 built in 1813 - and rebuiult in 1919? 
 was used for milling corn until the   
 introducion of engines and eletric    
 motors.                               </content>
