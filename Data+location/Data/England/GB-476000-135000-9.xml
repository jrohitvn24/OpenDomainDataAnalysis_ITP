		<title>09FARMING IN BORDON.</title>
		<content>     Farming in the Bordon area is     
 limited by the soil. Most of the area 
 is covered by a very coarse sandstone 
 which leeches out soil nutrients. It  
 is an area of heathland.The farms grew
 up where alluvium was deposited by    
 the River Wey and further irrigation  
 was perfected in this area by the     
 water meadow system. Bordon has seven 
 farms,most are dairy but some are     
 arable. There are two orchards        
 north_west of Shortheath Common       
 belonging to Rookery Farm. Baker's    
 Farm sells fruit, vegetables and      
 plants. There are plenty of arable    
 fields that grow cereals and corn     
 on the cob. A lot of the crops are    
 sold to local shops. The farming area 
 is mostly north-west of the           
 residential part of Bordon. Most farms
 branch off the B3004 or B3002.
