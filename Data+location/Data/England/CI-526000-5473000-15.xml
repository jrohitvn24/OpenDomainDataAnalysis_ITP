  In this Rural area there are quite a 
 few modern houses amongst the country 
 lanes.These houses are occupied by    
 First and Second class families,most  
 are well designed having large        
 double-glazed windows and most having 
 gardens spread over a wide area.Some  
 of these houses have large Patios and 
 may even have swimming pools.These    
 houses are luxurious to live in.The   
 people who own these houses have good 
 security and are well paid,and mainly 
 have an occupation as lawyers or      
 accountants.                          
  Families are on average made up of   
 four or five people.
