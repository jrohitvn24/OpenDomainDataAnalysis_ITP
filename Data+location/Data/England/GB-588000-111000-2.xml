		<title>02CLIFFS AND FORESHORE  PETT</title>
		<content> The cliffs at Pett, about 150 million 
 years old, are part of the Hastings   
 Beds, sandstone with clay underlay.   
 Clay saturated with water results in  
 landslipping.{Erosion}here has been   
 speeded up because of shingle         
 movement.  Chunks which fall at Cliff 
 End are usually roughly 2m x 4m,      
 following the Wedge theory, the fall  
 being proportional to the height of   
 the cliff.  The sea seems to have     
 reached parts of the present shoreline
 over 5000 years ago.  Evidence comes  
 from the foreshore where clay is      
 covered by freshwater peat and a layer
 of ancient tree stumps and timber.    
{Radiocarbon dating}suggests that a    
 forest probably grew in a swamp near  
 the shore 5200 to 5300 years ago.     
 Also visible at low tide is the       
 outline of the British warship 'Anne' 
 lost in Battle of Beachy Head (1690)  </content>
