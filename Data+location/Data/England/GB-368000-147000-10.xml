		<title>10  Finger Farm near Mells</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 25th  June we  went  to    
 Finger  Farm. The farmer showed us    
 around the  farm. He had a dog named  
 Toby which  is black with a white star
 on his neck. He showed us the cows and
 then he said if you come back soon you
 can see the cows being milked. Then he
 showed us around the herring bone     
 milking parlour. There were eight cows
 each side and when they had finished  
 being milked the cups came off        
 automatically. The cows were eating   
 their food while the farmer was       
 milking them. Then we went out of the 
 milking room and the farmer showed us 
 where he put the cows' food in the    
 yard and he told us that the collars  
 round the cows' necks were there to   
 send a signal to the computer every   
 time the cows came for food and each  
 cow automatically got the right amount
 of food.                              </content>
