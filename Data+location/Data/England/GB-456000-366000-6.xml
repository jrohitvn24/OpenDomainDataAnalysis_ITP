		<content>  The{oldest}stone buildings are sited 
 near the river crossings and at main  
 road junctions.                       
{ Around 1900}mines were sunk and      
 colliery companies built terraced     
 homes for employees.                  
{ Before 1939}the Council only built   
 150 houses,others were built by the   
 N.C.B.After the war the Council built 
 traditional,semi-detached,brick houses
 and bought some N.C.B.houses,for the  
 growing population.                   
{ The past 25 years}have seen the      
 growth of private estates on the      
 outskirts,redevelopment in the centre,
 and purpose-built complexes for the   
 elderly.                              
{ In recent years}Government has       
 encouraged some tenants to buy their  
 Council houses,reducing the number of 
 rented properties available.Some      
 regard this as a cause for concern.   </content>
