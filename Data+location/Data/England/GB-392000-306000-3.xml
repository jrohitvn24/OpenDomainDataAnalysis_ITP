		<title>03FARMING METHODS</title>
		<content>Traditional methods of spraying weeds  
and pests with a tractor using boom arm
are still used but aerial spraying is  
used by the more progressive farmers to
control aphids and potato blight.After 
harvest,controlled burning of stubble  
is carried out, sometimes with         
disastrous effects on hedges and       
wildlife.Outside help is not normally  
employed except for the harvest, when  
contractors are hired and the combine  
harvesters work through the night with 
the aid of large powerful lamps.The    
grain crops are transported to a farm  
where there are sheds containing drying
equipment and bins marked with each    
farmers name to store the dry grain    
ready for transporting to market.Stony 
soil in the area prevents the growing  
of potatoes or sugar beet on a large   
scale.
