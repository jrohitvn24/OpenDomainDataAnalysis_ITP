		<title>12CYCLING FOR CHILDREN</title>
		<content> NOWADAYS, CYCLING IS A VERY POPULAR   
 HOBBY WITH CHILDREN AND THERE HAS BEEN
 A BOOM IN THE BIKES AVAILABLE  IN THE 
 SHOPS INCLUDING BOMBERS, TRAX, BMX,   
 GRIFTERS, BOXERS AND RACERS. MOST BOYS
 WANT A BMX ON WHICH TRICKS OF ALL     
 KINDS CAN BE DONE. THEY CAN BE        
 DANGEROUS AND SO PROTECTIVE GEAR MUST 
 BE WORN TO AVOID INJURY. THE BIKES    
 ARE STRENGTHENED AND THEY CAN COST    
 FROM Â£85 TO Â£9OO. TO SHOW HOW POPULAR 
 THEY ARE WE ASKED THE 98 JUNIORS IN   
 SCHOOL WHICH THEY WOULD LIKE NEW OUT  
 OF THE FOLLOWING WITH THESE REULTS:-  
             PREFER NEW     POSSESS NOW
   SKATEBOARD     1              15    
   ROLLER SKATES 13              42    
   BMX BIKE      71              33    
   TROLLEY        O               5    
   ORDINARY BIKE 13              49    
 WE THINK THAT BMX BIKES WILL BE A REAL
 SUCCESS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE EXPENSIVE</content>
