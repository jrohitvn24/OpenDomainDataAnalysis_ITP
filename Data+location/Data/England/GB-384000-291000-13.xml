		<title>13Parish Church, Wombourne</title>
		<content> In the  centre of  the village  facing
the village green stands the church  of
St.Benedict Biscop.Although the present
building dates back to 1851, the  first
religious  building  on  this  site was
erected over one thousand years ago.   
 The  present  church  has a bell tower
with 8 bells and a very  tall spire. In
recent  years  80000 pounds  had  to be
raised to  renovate these  parts of the
church. On the tower there  are 2 clock
faces. Inscribed on the clock mechanism
inside are these words.                
     KEEP ME CLEAN AND OIL ME WELL     
    AND I TO YOU THE TIME WILL TELL    
 In the grounds of the church there are
many gravestones which are very old.The
inscriptions on some have been worn  by
the  weather. Inside  there is a  vault
underneath  the  church. It is  used by
the Shaw-Hellier family who used to own
much of the surrounding land.          </content>
