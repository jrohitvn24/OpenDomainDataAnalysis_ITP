		<title>13Potteric Carr Nature Reserve</title>
		<content> Potteric Carr{Nature Reserve}is       
 situated in a shallow basin of land   
 and consists mainly of peat and clay  
 deposits. The Yorkshire Naturalists   
 Trust took over Potteric Carr from    
 B.R.in 1968 and despite threats from a
 proposed{motorway railway}development 
 and its use for flood relief,it is now
 seen as an area of some importance.   
 Potteric Carr consists of two areas of
 open water,reed fen,marsh ,birch and  
 oak woodland,magnesium limestone      
 sidings and large railway lines and   
 waste ground. Large numbers of{water  
{birds}are attracted to the area for   
 winter feeding,summer breeding and a  
 haven in passage.Many species of duck 
 together with migrants like field fare
 seek food and shelter in the winter.  
 Later in the year,{summer migrants    
 increase the already large bird       
 population.                           </content>
