		<title>08Highbrook - Communications</title>
		<content> Almost all homes in the area possess  
 telephones and these are the most     
 common method of communication,       
 largely replacing letters except those
 of a business nature. There is a twice
 daily postal delivery.Within the last 
 few years the one bus service crossing
 the area has been rerouted. It is no  
 longer possible to reach a shopping   
 centre by bus. The severely limited   
 nature of the public bus service makes
 it necessary for most families to run 
 a car and the more affluent run at    
 least two. The area is a convenient   
 location for car owners being close to
 mainline stations,three within a      
 twelve mile radius, the motorway      
 network ten miles away and Gatwick    
 International airport also ten miles  
 away. The short Bluebell rail track is
 not linked to mainline services.
