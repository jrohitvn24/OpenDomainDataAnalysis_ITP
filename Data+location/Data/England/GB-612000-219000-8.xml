		<title>08SPORTING FACILITIES</title>
		<content>  In{Weeley}and around the{Weeley Heath
 area, the only sporting facilities    
 are the football club and the tennis  
 court which closed down about 5 years 
 ago. The nearest sports centre is in{ 
{Little Clacton.                       
  In the area of{Weeley Heath}the      
 majority of the inhabitants are       
 elderly and so the only form of       
 recreation is gardening. As the       
 majority of people do a lot of        
 gardening, the{Kidby's Nursery}is very
 successful. This nursery sell a wide  
 variety of produce such as cabages,   
 tomatoes, etc. In a small survey that 
 I conducted, I found that{10%}of the  
 people were sporting and{90%}were     
 satisfied with gardening.             
  All the childen in the area play on  
 the fields near the football club     
 where there are swings and slides.
