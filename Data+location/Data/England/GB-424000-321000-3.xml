		<content>     Ind Coope Brewery is one of the   
two biggest breweries in               
Burton-on-Trent.                       
     They are   building a bridge that 
stretches from the car park to the     
brewery itself.A few months back they  
had a new maltings built onto the      
brewery.                               
    Ind Coope are also having another  
bit built onto the place so they can   
put the barrels inside.All the car     
park has been ripped up for the bridge.
The top of the maltings has SKOL and   
lights  around with a huge twenty four 
hour clock.   It also gives a digital  
temperature reading.
