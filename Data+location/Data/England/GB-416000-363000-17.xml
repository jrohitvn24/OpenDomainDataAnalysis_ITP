		<content> A Well dressing is done each year     
 during the third week in May. This is 
 a thanksgiving for the gift of pure   
 water. It is a picture in an elaborate
 border depicted in flower petals,     
 leaves and moss on clay. It takes a   
 week to make, is unveiled early on a  
 Saturday morning and then is left on  
 display for a week for all to enjoy.  
 Mischief night is on Halloween when   
 the children bang the door knockers,  
 remove gates and have an evening of   
 pranks.                               
 A craft workshop was held weekly for  
 three months in the Village Hall to   
 bring together people of all ages. The
 items produced were sold at the annual
 village market, the garden fete with  
 Youlgrave and a garden fete in the    
 village for "Save the Children" fund.
