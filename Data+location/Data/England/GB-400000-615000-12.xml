		<title>12FAUNA OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
 There is a varied fauna in the        
 area.Occasional visitors to the river 
 are deer-these more especially in the 
 east of the area.Foxes are very common
 in certain areas and are regularly    
 hunted during autumn,winter and       
 spring.Local anglers often find       
 trout(brown and rainbow)and           
 salmon.There is virtually no pollution
 in the river.When the river is in     
 flood the water is a beer colour      
 because of the peat in the            
 water.Common birds are found all      
 around the river as well as others    
 like herons,dippers,ring-ouzels and   
 oystercatchers.Relative newcomers to  
 the area include the gosander which is
 blamed locally for taking large       
 numbers of fish.
