		<content>  A group of children visited houses in
 the village and questioned occupants  
 as to their feelings about local      
 conditions and issues.Most were long  
 established residents who valued the  
 village for its beauty, peace and the 
 local life.Few had serious complaints 
 about the place.A few wished for fewer
 tourists, one for a butcher's shop,   
 one for better street lighting and one
 for tidier streets.Most folk used     
 private cars for transport,but the bus
 services are also used by many.       
   Shopping loyalty is divided between 
 local shops, delivery vans and the    
 large urban Supermarkets in Poole and 
 Bournemouth. Below is a list of local 
 amenities:                            
{Gardening Club, W.I.,Youth Club,      
{Mother's Union,Ferkins, Church Men's  
{Club, Play Group,Over 60's,Travelling 
{Library,Methodist's Dancing Group. }  </content>
