		<content>{Housing in Alstonefield}              
     Some of the houses in Alstonefield
are quite old.  There are a lot of farm
buildings, like cowsheds and haybarns. 
There is a large number of bed and     
breakfast houses and holiday cottages. 
There is a chapel, but it is being     
converted into a house.  We have a     
village hall and the school is being   
converted into another village hall.

     The residents in our area say the 
most important technological           
developments in the parish are         
having the public telephone,           
       the public toilets,             
       the bus to Ashbourne,           
       electricity,                    
       mains water and                 
       farming equipment.
