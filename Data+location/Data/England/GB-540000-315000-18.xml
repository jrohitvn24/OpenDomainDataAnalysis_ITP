		<title>18LOOKING AT TYDD ST.GILES</title>
		<content>    In Tydd St. Giles the landscape is 
 flat.You can see a long way because   
 the land is so flat.You can see a lot 
 of blue sky because there are no hills
 to get in the way.In  the sky you     
 see a lot of R.A.F. planes training,  
 and helicopters spraying the fields of
 corn and potatoes.                    
    There are no woods or forests to be
 seen, but there are lots of scattered 
 trees.Many of them are willows and    
 poplars.A lot of willows grow along   
 the edges of the dykes. We have       
 planted a lot of different trees round
 school.                               
    The roads are mainly straight,     
 but very bumpy. This is because the   
 silt and peat underneath is always    
 settling and moving. Along both sides 
 of the roads are usually dykes to     
 drain the water away.
