		<title>20           HOUDINI</title>
		<content> On the school field we found a small  
 caterpillar it was hairy and          
 prickly.It's colours were Black,Orange
 and White with Red eyes.It moved very 
 strangely it was moving some parts of 
 the body and leaving some behind.We   
 picked it up and found it shrugged and
 clinched onto anything.It had fourteen
 legs and on paper could move very     
 quickly.Then it escaped but two days  
 later we found him again.             
 Day 1:Found Houdini on school hedge   
 whilst looking for bird-nests.We      
 called him Houdini because he could   
 escape from anything.                 
 Day 2:Houdini had escaped so we looked
 but couldn't find him                 
 Day 3:Found Houdini and gave him      
 another bed because former one was wet
 Day 4:Houdini kept escaping out of our
 tub and kept getting bigger by the    
 minute.    By J.WATSON &amp; B.HEMSLEY.   </content>
