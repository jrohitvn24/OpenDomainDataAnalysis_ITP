		<title>10NARROW GAUGE RAILWAY:History</title>
		<content> The origional motive power was        
 provided by two Hudswell-Clarke       
{locomotives}built in 1918 for the     
 Italian War Campaign. Not very        
 satisfactory in service they were     
 quickly replaced by ex_War Department 
 armoured petrol locomotives.          
                                       
 Locos of a similar type built by      
 Motor-Rail at their Simplex works in  
 Bedford remained in service           
 thereafter.  The machines within the  
 quarries were 20 horsepower, those on 
 the Light Railway were 40 hp.         
                                       
 The Railway Company was a private     
 company with individual quarries being
 shareholders.  In 1963 Arnolds bought 
 out the other firms.                  
                                       
 At its peak the railway carried 3000  
 tons a week over 4 miles of track.    </content>
