		<title>16PRESTWICH HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Prestwich Hospital caters for 900     
 patients.The way in which it treats   
 the patients has altered considerably 
 since the first records in 1889.Then  
 the patients were kept under very     
 severe supervision and were not       
 allowed out of the hospital grounds,  
 which were surrounded by a high       
 fence.                                
 Now the emphasis is on rehabilitation 
 and the patients are encouraged to    
 look after themselves.Group activities
 include the value of money,personal;  
 hygiene,cooking etc. thus getting     
 patients ready to cope with life      
 outside the Hospital.Many come to the 
 village to shop, and use their leisure
 time watching television or attending 
 discos or bingo sessions held in the  
 Patients Cafe.
