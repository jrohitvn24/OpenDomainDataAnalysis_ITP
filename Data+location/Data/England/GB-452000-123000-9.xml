		<title>09THE CRICKET DOWN</title>
		<content>    The Cricket Down is owned by the   
 Parish Council. It is used by the     
 cricketers and the footballers. The   
 children of the village come down and 
 play on it as well. A teacher who     
 lives in the area holds games evenings
 in the spring and the summer so the   
 children from the village come and    
 play rounders. The teacher is called  
 Mrs Hancook.                          
    The cricketers only play in the    
 summer, during the weekends and       
 evenings. During the winter months the
 down is used for football.            
    Owslebury village has it's own     
 football and cricket teams. They are  
 an important part of village life.    
 There is a pavillion for the use of   
 the players.
