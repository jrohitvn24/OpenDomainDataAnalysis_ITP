		<title>18Interview with a farmer</title>
		<content> I am a dairy farmer and I have lived  
 here for 58 years.  I own 42 acres of 
 land and about 3 acres of housing.    
 The main business part is called      
 'Barns End' but I have a few other    
 buildings.  I own five portions of    
 land each a half a mile apart.  I also
 own 50 cows which feed on a small     
 pellet called 'dairy feed' in the     
 winter.  The milk they produce I      
 bottle myself.  I own 4 tractors and  
 all my own equipment.  My 2 sons help 
 me on the farm.  A school near here   
 has made me a governor and a chairman.
  I am a Methodist but as there is only
 a Church of England near, which has no
 resident vicar, I attend there.  The  
 bus service is not regular so I have a
 car to get me to town.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
