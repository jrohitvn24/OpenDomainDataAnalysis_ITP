		<content>     Gatwick farm is a typical example 
 of the type of{farming}in the area. It
 is set in a very open area, quite near
 the small village of Chipstead and is 
 surrounded by fields. The land (of a  
{chalky}nature) is nearly all given    
 over to rough, arable{grazing}and is  
 used for cattle and horses. Gatwick   
 Farm is not a large one, but it is    
 adequate and manages to cope with the 
 9_10 acres of land surrounding it. To 
 the rough north_east of Gatwick Farm  
 there is  Gatwick wood - a small wood,
 containing small, deciduous trees.    
     Although the farming is mainly    
 grazing, there is some{hay}grown for  
 winter stores and some{cereal crops   
 are grown. The{equipment}used         
 is quite modern (e.g. tractors and    
 combine harvesters.)There are not many
{workers}on the farm, but they manage  
 quite well with their individual jobs.</content>
