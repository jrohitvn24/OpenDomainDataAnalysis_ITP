		<content>     The church is in the centre of a  
 populated area , many people come to  
 the church.                           
     The Lady Chapel was the original  
 church. The rest of the church was    
 built around the Lady chapel. The     
 church was supposed to be much        
 bigger but the building work was held 
 up when the war started. After the war
 it was never finished because of the  
 cost.                                 
     They managed to build a small     
 porch and a bell tower.               
     There is a lot of ground around   
 the church and it is set with many    
 unusual shrubs. It also contains a    
 burial ground. In one corner, close to
 the road is a memorial cross to the   
 dead of both world wars. A service is 
 held here on the Sunday nearest to    
 11th November.                        
      The choir is of a high standard, </content>
