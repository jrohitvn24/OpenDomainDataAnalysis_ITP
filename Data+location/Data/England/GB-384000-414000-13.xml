		<title>13The Supernatural in Norden</title>
		<content> In our area we have heard several     
 tales about ghosts but the most       
 interesting is a ghost called the Grey
 Lady, Who is believed to haunt the    
 Manor Court in Norden. Before the     
 Manor became a pub it was a hospital. 
 The Grey Lady was a nurse there. Some 
 people say that the Grey Lady was     
 beheaded and others say she caught a  
 disease from one of the patients and  
 died. Almost everyone agrees that she 
 killed patients in the old hospital.  
    We have asked people questions but 
 some seem reluctant to answer them.   
 Just who is the Grey Lady ?           
    We have also heard other tales     
 concerning Greenbooth ( a village     
 drowned under a reservoir ) and St.   
 Paul's church, as well as the old     
 Riviera swimming pool.
