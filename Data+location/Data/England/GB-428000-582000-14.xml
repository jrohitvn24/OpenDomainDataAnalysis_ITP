		<content> The manager of the factory begins work
 at 8.45 and finishes at 5.00 pm with  
 an hour for lunch.He likes his work   
 and says that he would rather be      
 working with people than in an        
 automated factory.He thinks           
 expansion is important and that he    
 would be worried if their major       
 contract was cancelled.He expects     
 people who apply for jobs to be honest
 and reliable but some need 6 'O'      
 levels and a few 'A' levels.          
    The average working week is 36-38  
 hours which may be done in shifts.The 
 retirement age is 65. Refreshments may
 be bought on the premises.Up to now   
 there has never been a strike and the 
 manager hopes it will remain that     
 way.Workers must obey several safety  
 rules such as no matches or lighters  
 on the premises.                      
                                       </content>
