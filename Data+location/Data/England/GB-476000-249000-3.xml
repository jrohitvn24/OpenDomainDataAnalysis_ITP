Hartwell is particularly badly off for 
things to occupy the teenagers.There   
is nothing to do apart from a monthly  
youth club.There are more things for   
the younger children.Most teenagers go 
to Roade where things are more lively. 
Ashton has similar problems but most   
of the people there are better off and 
can take their children to more        
places.Our  village used to have a     
football and a   cricket team as well  
as a more regular  youth club but they 
closed through lack of support.Most    
people aren't bothered  about our      
village.They drive elsewhere for water 
sports or keep fit or else stay at     
home to watch television,videos or use 
home computers.It will need a real     
effort and a lot of money and trust to 
improve the situation.                 </content>
