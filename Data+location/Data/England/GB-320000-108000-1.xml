 This area divides into two sections.  
 Most of it consists of the upper      
 valley of the Otter, where the hills  
 begin to close in round the river as  
 you approach its source,which lies a  
 mile or two to the north.The smaller  
 eastern section is part of the flat   
 Blackdown tableland,about 200         
 metres above sea-level and stretching 
 fingerlike southwards between the     
 Otter and Yarty valleys.              
      The valley area is well watered  
 by many small streams  and rills:and  
 after a heavy fall of rain the air is 
 full of the sound of gurgling water.  
 The land is only suitable for grazing,
 but this is carried on intensively,   
 and the landscape is a patchwork of   
 green fields,copses,isolated          
 farmsteads and winding lanes between  
 hedges.                               </content>
