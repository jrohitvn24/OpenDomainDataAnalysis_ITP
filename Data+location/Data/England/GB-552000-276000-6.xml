		<content> The growing of sugar beet, onions,    
 celery, carrots and potatoes in this  
 area means that there is a demand for 
 the processing of them before going on
 to the wholesaler. This means that the
 use of lorries to move the produce is 
 very important. Lorries carrying the  
 sugar-beet to the processing factories
 at Wissington (Near Downham Market)   
 and Bury St Edmunds are a common site,
 whilst the celery, carrots and onions 
 are processed near Barway (just off   
 the designated area). Potatoes are a  
 very popular crop and lorries set off 
 regularly for the big markets in      
 London. Common sites in the area are  
 th mounds of sugar-beet by the side of
 the road (mainly in Nov - Feb)        
 awaiting collection and carrots, beet 
 and onions lying on the roads having  
 fallen off the lorries.
