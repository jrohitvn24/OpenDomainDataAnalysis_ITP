		<content>    Leaning over the bible,is a large  
 eagle which is carved from the same   
 piece of wood.Instead of climbing the 
 stairs up to the{bell tower}to ring   
 the bells, the ropes come down through
 the pillars and come out into a       
 cupboard in the wall.A set of stairs  
 lead up to an old room where the past 
 vicars used to change before they gave
 their sermons.Outsidein the{graveyard 
 there are many graves with tombstones 
 and in the centre grows an enormous   
 yew tree which is about 500 years old.
    There are usually about 8{funerals 
 and 6{weddings}held every year at St. 
 Marks.The Reverend Moore runs a Sunday
 School called the 4th Sunday Club     
 which is held every 4th Sunday.
