{estates.}The original village grew up 
 around its church and landowner's     
 park, where you can still find        
{cottages and private housing.}There   
 are Edwardian{terraced houses}on      
 Nottingham Road. The late 1930s saw   
 the first council estate in Chaddesden
 which was followed by others until the
 1960s. These estates grew up as farm  
 lands were taken over by{Derby        
{Corporation.  }                       
                                       
 The most recent house building        
 programme in the area is at{Oakwood,  
 to the north of Chaddesden. This is a 
 private development which is expected 
 to take fifteen years to complete. It 
 is thought to be one of the largest   
 single building projects in Europe.
