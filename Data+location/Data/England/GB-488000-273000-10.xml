		<title>10Burton Latimer High Streeet</title>
		<content> This text refers to the data collected
on the street survey which is given on 
page 9.                                
 More women were questioned as men     
were at work and in most households    
women tend to do the shopping.         
 The age group 31-60 was most widely   
represented.Under 30's would be at work
or school and the elderly do not get   
out so many times.                     
 The majority of people visited the    
High Street daily to shop. Daily needs 
were bread, milk &amp; papers. For a wider 
range of goods people go to Kettering. 
 People on business were going to the  
bank and the most common other reason  
given was meeting children from school.
 The vast majority of people walked to 
the High Street indicating that they   
live locally. Few people who           
didn't live in Burton Latimer were     
found in the High Street.              </content>
