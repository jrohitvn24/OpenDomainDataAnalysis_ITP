		<content>The name of the village Drayton        
Bassett, mentioned in the original     
Domesday Book, comes from the Norman   
Turstine de Bassett in passession in   
1086. The name 'Bassett' was added to  
distinguish it from other Draytons. The
Bassett line died in 1390. The village 
is associated with the Peel family.    
Robert Peel the elder bought the estate
in 1790,having made his fortune in the 
cotton textile industry in Bury,       
Lancashire. He became a local          
benefactor providing schools, church   
and the Swiss style cottages for his   
estate workers in the village. 6       
generations of the Peel family lived in
Drayton Manor,including Sir            
Robert,Prime Minister, founder of      
Metropolitan police (1829) responsible 
for the Tamworth Manifesto (1834)      
outlining future conservative party    
policy. This association ended in 1934.</content>
