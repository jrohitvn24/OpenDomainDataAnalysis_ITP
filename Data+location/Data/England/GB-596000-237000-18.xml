  The Village School,built in 1876 with
three rooms,started life with 112      
children of all ages,many only three   
years old.By 1945 the number on roll   
had dropped to 18,up to 11 years       
old.In 1974 the school became a first  
school for children from 5 to 9 years. 
The roll is now 51 children.Some       
children are transported to school by  
mini-bus,and hot meals are brought to  
the Village Hall at midday from Stoke  
by Nayland Middle School a mile        
away.Recent innovations in the school  
have included a computer,calculators, a
video-cassette recorder,and large      
physical education apparatus(kept and  
used in the new Village Hall.)         
 Playing in the playground,I have fun, 
 Even if it's kiss chase,I have fun,   
 Even if it's "it",I have fun.
