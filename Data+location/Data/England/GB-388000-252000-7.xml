		<content>{Place names}-Bredicot derives from    
 Brada's Cot, Brada being the name of  
 the owner of a small cottage there, in
 Anglo-Saxon times. Churchill appears  
 self explanatory but may mean a       
 hill with a burial mound, having      
 derived from the Celtic word "ciric"  
 meaning a burial mound.               
 Spetchley means a place for making    
 speeches in a forest clearing made by 
 an Anglo-Saxon chieftain. {           
{Bredicot}-well-researched by a local  
 historian, was formerly a Roman       
 Settlement. It became part of the     
 Royal Forest until the 14th century   
 and was the property of the Prior at  
 Worcester Cathedral. The tiny{chapel  
 of St James the Less was built in the 
 13th century. After the Civil War,    
 Bredicot was sold and only returned to
 the Cathedral at the Restoration      
 It now mostly belongs to the estate.  </content>
