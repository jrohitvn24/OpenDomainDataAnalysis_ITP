		<title>12DORRINGTON TALES</title>
		<content>   One day our class went for a walk to
 Dorrington which is the place where my
 dad used to live.The night before we  
 went he told me the story of the      
 church.In one of the gardens at       
 Dorrington there is a stone           
 monument.It is said the stone was left
 there to show where the church used to
 be.The fairies were supposed to have  
 moved the church in the night to the  
 top of the hill next to the main      
 road.Nobody can prove it isn't true   
 but nobody can prove it's true either.
 There are many stories made up by     
 villagers.  By Joanna Blow - age 11   
                                       
       THE DEVIL THROUGH THE KEY-HOLE. 
   It is said that if you run round    
 Dorrington Church twice,starting dead 
 on midnight and then look through the 
 key-hole you can see the devil.
