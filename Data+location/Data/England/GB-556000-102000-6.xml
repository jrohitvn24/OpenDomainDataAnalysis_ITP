		<title>06EDUCATION AROUND WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   Several similarities exist between  
 the schools in this area showing a    
 uniform approach to education.        
   The school day still begins with an 
 assembly.Much importance is attached  
 to home/school liaison as is shown by 
 the fact that all schools except the  
 Infant and special schools send home  
 written reports and all schools give  
 parents regular opportunities to meet 
 the staff to discuss their child's    
 educational progress.                 
   All schools except Lindfield have a 
 uniform, although wearing it is       
 optional at Willingdon Trees.         
   Formal testing is carried out at all
 schools, except the Infant and Special
 Schools.                              
   Every school has its own games field
 and a computer is now a common element
 in a teacher's resources. Only one    
 school has its own swimming pool.     </content>
