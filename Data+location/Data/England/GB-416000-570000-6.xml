		<title>06AGRICULTURE:GOAT KEEPING</title>
		<content> On{Hall Cottage Farm}they keep goats. 
 The goats were black and white and    
 some were tan and shandy.Some goats   
 have two tassles under their chin     
 which were used for{breathing}a long  
 time ago.Most goats have horns but    
 some farmers do not like these so they
 get their goats dehorned.This has to  
 be done when they are a few days      
 old,because if it was left till later 
 then it would damage their brains.In  
 the winter the goats are taken into   
 the shed for warmth.                  
  The goats on the farm produce        
 milk.The{milk}is used for the baby    
 animals on the farm and is            
 sold,chiefly to people who are        
 allergic to cows milk.Goats are       
 intelligent animals:they have a black 
 goat which is the leader and they     
 always line up in a special order to  
 be milked.                            </content>
