		<content> St.Saviours is claustropobic inside.  
 The entrance is via a modern porch.The
 pews are of a wooden design,with      
 brightly coloured kneelers.By the side
 of them is a stick, which was used to 
 chase dogs out of church in the past. 
  Behind the altar is the east window  
 which is the largest in the building. 
 It allows early morning light to enter
 It is a black leaded window,with      
 diamond shaped fragments,some are     
 frosted,some clear.The clear glass is 
 replacement glass,caused by vandalism.
  The lecterns are mostly of brass.Some
 are of beautifully carved wood. Just  
 on the edge of a step going up to the 
 altar is a kind of carved bench.Next  
 to the altar is a large window,which  
 has 2 hooks,which were used for       
 blackout curtains.On the wall is a    
 plaque commemorating 3 men who were   
 killed in World War 1.                </content>
