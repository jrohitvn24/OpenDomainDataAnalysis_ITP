		<title>10TELEPHONE EXCHANGE</title>
		<content>    This  telephone  exchange serves an
 area 10 kilometres  by  10  kilometres
 around  Carnon  Downs with 4,000 tele-
 phone users.    It became an automatic
 exchange in 1921.    Before that there
 was a switchboard and manual operators
 connecting  2,000  telephones  but now
 only one man is needed to work  at the
 exchange. In 15 years time the service
 will  be run by  micro chips  and this
 small exchange will be closed.The most
 recent  extension  to enlarge  the ex-
 change cost 250,000.                  
    The price of one telephone call now
 from a public phone  box is 10p  for 2
 minutes if  it is  a  local  call  and
 5p from a private home but at home you
 have to pay Â£94  a year rent. The cost
 of a 2 min call to  London from a call
 box is about Â£1.30  at peak time which
 is during weekday mornings.           
    The Exchange is at Carnon Downs.   </content>
