        Mr.Strawbridge also feels the  
 roads in Culmstock have changed since 
 he was a lad.For him the increase in  
 traffic has meant a far more hectic   
 life style however.This is perhaps one
 of the reasons why there has been a   
 decrease in the wild life on the banks
 of the Culm.Mr. Strawbridge remembers 
 far more water voles, rabbits ,foxes, 
 moorhens, kingfishers and dippers than
 there are now.The wild life may have  
 been encouraged by the fact that the  
 hedge rows were higher in those       
 days.Treats for the children were     
 fewer then,a trip to the seaside or   
 roast chicken for dinner being        
 something to remember.That doesn't    
 mean life was all dull.Mr Strawbridge 
 recalls burning the headmaster's cane 
 and spreading caps on the floor for   
 the poor man to walk on!              </content>
