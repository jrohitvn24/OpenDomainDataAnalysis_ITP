		<title>09The Development of Old Hall</title>
		<content> A year later in 1982 there were a     
 thousand peolple living in Old Hall.In
 February 82 the new school of Old Hall
 County Primary was opened with 40     
 children and 4 teachers.              
 In May 1982 the children of the school
 opened the nearby new road and were   
 treated to a party by the New Town    
 Development Corporation.Today in 1985 
 there are 3,500 people living in Old  
 Hall.The camps have gone and so have  
 most of the fields,now there are      
 roads,houses,cars,and people          
 everywhere.                           
 The tree is still there watching the  
 farmhouse turn into a pub,the Old Hall
 renovated,more houses built,and more  
 and more people moving in.            
 The Old Chestnut tree is probably     
 wondering if the people will stay this
 time.The signs are that they probably 
 will.                                 </content>
