		<title>14Belstead Pumping Station</title>
		<content>Belstead pumping station is supplying  
Chantry and some of the Belstead area. 
It has three bore holes which go down  
100m.  The water level is 20m. and the 
pump goes down 30m.  Every hour 500,000
litres can be pumped from the bore     
holes. When the water comes out it is  
aerated.  Then it is purified.  Then a 
little bit of chlorine is added to kill
germs.  In Ipswich altogether there is 
50,000 litres stored.  Six years ago   
there had to be a man at the station to
work.  Now the pumps are worked by     
computer.

Note: There has been concern about the 
high level of nitrates in local water  
supplies due to agricultural fertiliz- 
ers.  Water rates are considered high  
in relation to the rest of the country,
especially where quality is concerned. </content>
