		<title>13BIBURY PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school was built in 1847. Today it
 has 25 Junior pupils and 18 Infants.  
 Each classroom has a computer and we  
 also have a mathematics room and a    
 library. We have our own cook and once
 a week we share our meal with Senior  
 Citizens from the village. The school 
 is next to the church where A service 
 is held each term. The vicar comes to 
 the school every week to teach us     
 about the Bible. Every year we write  
 our own Christmas plays which we      
 perform for the village. We have a    
 small playground and garden so sport  
 activities are held at the village    
 cricket pitch or in the garden. Each  
 week we go swimming in Cirencester. We
 take part in the local country dance  
 festival, music festival and perform  
 at the church fete.
