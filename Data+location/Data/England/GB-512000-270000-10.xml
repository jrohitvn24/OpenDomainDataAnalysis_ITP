		<content> Mrs. Skinner's father was the owner of
 the old windmill in Ellington which   
 was built in the eighteenth century.  
 The mill stood in a field called Mill 
 Peace.Pigeons and vermin lived inside 
 it so the owners sold it to an        
 American man called Mr. Rowland,who   
 moved it to Maddingly.The new owners  
 didn't look after it so it's now in   
 ruins.Mr. Skinner moved to Ellington  
 in 1918 and has owned the pig farm up 
 the present day.When Mr.Skinner       
 first owned the farm he had about two 
 hundred pigs but now he has over three
 thousand five hundred.                
    The earth in this area is very     
 good for planting crops.Mr.Skinner    
 grows wheat,barley and rape.          
    Mr.Skinner takes part in all the   
 village activities,and has never      
 wished to move away from this area.
