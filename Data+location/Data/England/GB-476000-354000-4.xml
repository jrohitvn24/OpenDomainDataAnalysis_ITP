		<content> Newark stands on the junction of the  
 Trent and Devon rivers and at the     
 point where The Great North Road      
 crosses the Fosse Way.In recent years 
 the Kelham Road area has been subject 
 to much flooding in the houses due to 
 the rising of the River Trent.The     
 Midland Railway crosses the Great     
 Northen Railway.                      
 The population is sited in houses on  
 the fringe of the River Trent adjacent
 to the Cattle Market.There is also an 
 itinerant caravan site.Some new first 
 homes have been built.The land is flat
 and highly cultivated.The castle      
 "commands" the higher area.           
 The site of Newark is striking with   
 its imposing castle and busy Cattle   
 Market.There is a Highways Dept,an    
 Agricultural Engineers,a Public House 
 and a Railway Station.
