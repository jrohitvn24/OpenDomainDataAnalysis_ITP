		<title>11THE FARMING YEAR</title>
		<content> At the beginning of the year there is 
 often bad weather with snow causing   
 problems with lambing.Lambs can be    
 born backwards,the mothers leave      
 them,steal them or have a prolapse.   
 Calving follows with similar          
 difficulties,often in the middle of   
 the night.                            
  The year contines with silage being  
 made in May. Sheep need treatment as  
 summer comes so they are clipped and  
 dipped for protection from insects.   
  Farmers hope to begin cropping hay in
 July but bad weather can stop them.   
 Then they have to hire contracters to 
 do the work with round balers.        
  In September lamb sales begin.There  
 are marts in Bellingham,Hexham and    
 further away. These go on through the 
 autumn and farmers buy in winter feed.
 Sheep and cattle are brought in to    
 sheds as the winter begins again.     </content>
