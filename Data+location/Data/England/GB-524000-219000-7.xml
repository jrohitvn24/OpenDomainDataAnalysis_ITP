		<title>07New Housing Estates</title>
		<content> Knebworth village is expanding        
 rapidly.  A number of new housing     
 estates have been built recently,     
 the latest being behind Wadnall Way   
 and Meadway.  Most of the houses are  
 terraced houses but there are also a  
 few detached houses.  To make the new 
 estate look more attractive the       
 builders are laying turf and planting 
 shrubs around the houses when they are
 finished.  I think it will be very    
 nice when it is finished.  It is right
 by my Nan's house.  They have put a   
 fence up as well.  My Nan is a bit    
 upset because it blocks the nice views
 of the fields that she had before.
