		<title>07THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The Village Hall was built by Public  
 Subscription in 1892. The hall was    
 given to the village on a 99 year     
 lease by Sir Hary Vernon of {Hanbury  
{Hall.}Trustees were appointed to look 
 after the hall and the management     
 committee was made up of a member of  
 each organization using the hall.     
 In the past as many as seventeen clubs
 and organizations used the hall for   
 their meetings and events. The hall   
 was also used for Village dances and  
 cocerts. At times of local and        
 national elections the hall becomes a 
 polling station for the village and   
 surrounding district.                 
 The Village hall remains an important 
 part of village life. It is used by   
 the local Womens Institute, Playgroup,
 for whist drives and Church events    
 such as the Harvest Supper and        
 Christmas Fair.                       </content>
