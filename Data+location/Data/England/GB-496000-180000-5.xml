		<content>    {St. Anthony's Middle School}has   
 children aged from eight to twelve.   
 It is quite a large school and has a  
 large field.  It also has a very      
 beautiful Roman Catholic Church.  The 
 children attend services and sometimes
 even have lessons there.  Priests     
 visit the church and schools          
 frequently.                           
  {   William Penn Nursery, First}and  
{Middle Schools}are spread out in Penn 
 Road.  The Nursery School has children
 who are below five.  The First and    
 Middle Schools cater for the same age 
 ranges as St. Anthony's. They have a  
 Gymnasium which is also used for the  
 mid_day meal by both the First and    
 Middle Schools.  They have a small    
 plot of grass area to play on but have
 to go to Stoke Park playing fields for
 team games.
