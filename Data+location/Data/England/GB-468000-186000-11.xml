		<title>11The New Nettlebed Fete</title>
		<content>The fete has taken place every year in 
July.The fete was opened in 1976 by    
Mr Michael Heseltine, the local M.P.   
There is a competition for the cover of
the programme, you have to draw a      
picture of something in Nettlebed or   
something in the fete. Last year       
we had Derek Nimmo and this year 1985  
Doctor Who will open the fete.These    
people are television stars.Each year  
we have a competition for the best     
float.This year there will be a new    
competition,a six-a-side soccer        
tournament for the under elevens.There 
is a BMX club coming to do some stunts 
on bikes.Theres lots of stalls and     
food for sale. The fete is now run by  
the Nettlebed Sports Association. The  
money raised at last years fete went to
pay for a drainage system for the      
football pitch. The money raised this  
year goes to the Childrens Playground. </content>
