		<content> Life in our D Block is very different 
 from William I's day.                 
 Farming is still dominant in how the  
 land is used but far fewer people take
 part in agriculture.  We easily forget
 how much we depend on our farmers,    
 even in a country area like Tiverton. 
 Fashion and trends are different.     
 People now wear clothes which they    
 think will make them look attractive. 
 In the past the main concern was more 
 practical - to keep warm.             
 Transport is very different too.  The 
 countryside is crossed by hundreds of 
 tarmac-covered roads and most families
 have a car or use public transport.   
 The general public is now catered for 
 in a better way (eg schools, shops,   
 hospitals).                           
 People now can hold their own ideas   
 about politics and religion.          
 We are glad to be alive today!        </content>
