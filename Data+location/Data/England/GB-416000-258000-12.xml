		<title>12Farming in Bearley</title>
		<content> Over the past decade many changes have
 occureed in bearley. Land has been    
 swallowed up into enormous units and  
 two large estates now farm much of the
 area around Bearley once comprising of
 12 indiviudal farms. Hedges and       
 ditches have been torn up and drained 
 creating large prairie type field     
 with obsolete houses converted into   
 private dwellings and holiday flats.  
 During the War 500 acres of woodland  
 was felled and the land converted into
 an airfield. This subsequently        
 reverted to agriculture privately     
 farmed in conjunction with a British  
 Telecom Radio Station now in the      
 process of closing.                   
 Small plots of land have been sold as 
 pony paddocks and extended gardens by 
 enterprising farmers and one holding  
 converted into the local Gypsy Site.
