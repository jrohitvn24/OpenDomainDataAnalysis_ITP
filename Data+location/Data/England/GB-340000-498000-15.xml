		<content> There are 4 residential homes  in the 
 area for elderly people. Holehird, on 
 the Patterdale road and also the base 
 of the Lake District Horticultural    
 Society, is one of the Cheshire homes.
 It accomodates 30 handicapped people  
 in a fine lakeland stone house set in 
 beautiful grounds. Over 40 people help
 at the home and Round Table is one of 
 the local support groups. Robert was  
 the only local person in the home and 
 had been there 19 years. He enjoyed it
 because he did not feel isolated from 
 other people, they were allowed as    
 many visitors as they liked. He had   
 his own little garden as well.
