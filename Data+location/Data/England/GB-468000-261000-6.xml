 Most patients do occupational therapy 
of some sort to keep their minds       
active. They have pleasant recreation  
rooms with video and T.V. screens and  
where they can prepare snacks. There   
is a large theatre for concerts and    
frequent outings are organised.        
                                       
All meals are cooked in the hospital   
which has its own Bakery and Butchery  
(it supplies all the hospitals in      
Northants and Oxfordshire). There is a 
three choice menu which is planned     
monthly. The food is taken to the wards
in heated trolleys so that mealtimes   
can be fairly flexible.
