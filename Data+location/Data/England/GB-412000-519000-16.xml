		<content> Early education was linked with the   
 Church. There was a college for       
 priests &amp; laymen in the 15th century. 
 In 1710 a charity school was          
 established and by the 19th century   
 there were 7 schools in the village. A
 purpose built school  which became the
 Staindrop National school was opened  
 in 1841 &amp; in 1847 an Infant's school  
 was built by the Duke of Cleveland. In
 1902 the schools came under the       
 auspices of DCC &amp; scholarships to     
 Grammar schools in Bp. Auckland were  
 made available. The schools became    
 church controlled in 1951.The present 
 school was built in 1968, with about  
 120 pupils &amp; 5 teaching staff. The    
 pupils come from a four mile radius,  
 by minibus &amp; taxi. There is also a    
 comprehensive school with 725 pupils &amp;
 41 teachers + head. It opened in 1963 
 &amp; draws pupils from a 10 mile radius. </content>
