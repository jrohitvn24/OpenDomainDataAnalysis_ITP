		<title>15LIFE IN CARTHEW</title>
		<content> Old residents of Carthew were asked   
 how life has changed in the village   
 during the last 50 years:             
 COMMUNITY SPIRIT: Recently, many new  
 people have settled in the village and
 the community spirit is less.         
 WORK: People no longer have to work to
 survive. Machines have replaced manual
 work. Unemployment has risen to  17%. 
 WATER AND SANITATION: People used to  
 collect water in pitchers from a well 
 and take lavatory buckets down to the 
 river. Now each house has its own     
 indoor toilet and taps supply hot and 
 cold water.                           
 AMUSEMENTS: Card games, Chapel        
 concerts  and walks have been replaced
 by the radio and  television.         
 TRANSPORT: A steam train used to carry
 clay from Carthew, now replaced by    
 lorries. Formerly, people used to     
 cycle or walk, now most rely on cars. </content>
