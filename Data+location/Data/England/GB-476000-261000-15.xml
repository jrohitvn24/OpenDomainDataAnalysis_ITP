		<title>15 MY PART OF NORTHAMPTON</title>
		<content>I live down Bridgewater Drive which is 
a very pleasant area near to Abington  
Park and Weston Favell. The park is    
very large; it has three lakes, playing
fields, a play area with slides,       
swings, and climbing frames. There is  
also a museum which contains a special 
exhibition of things associated with   
the Northamptonshire Regiment as well  
as collections of old toys, lace and   
horse-drawn carriages.                 
Down Churchway near where I live there 
is an old church called St.Peters. I   
live in the parish of St. Gregory's and
go to St.Mary's Middle School for      
children aged nine to thirteen years.
