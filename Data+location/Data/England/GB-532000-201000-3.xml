		<content> Most people live in newish houses     
 with gardens that parents look        
 after.Families have two or three      
 children and a car which they use for 
 family outings at the weekend.Families
 where mums work often have two        
 cars.Dads use the car for work.If they
 leave early they are up first with    
 their children.The children's mums    
 make breakfast usually cereals.Some   
 children clean the car at weekends and
 dads spend their time on D.I.Y. around
 the house and mending cars.They often 
 watch T.V. Mums do the work around the
 house but most children do their      
 bedrooms. The "big shop" is done      
 during the week by mum. Sometimes     
 families have snack food but usually  
 they have cooked evening meals such as
 meat and vegetables.After dinner      
 children play out or look after the   
 family pets until bedtime.            </content>
