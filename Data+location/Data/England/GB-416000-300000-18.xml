		<title>18FARMING:ARABLE</title>
		<content>The farms Heathley, Lodge and Hill were
originaly seperate farms, but now have 
merged to create larger fields and so  
increase the profits made on arable    
crops.  Major crops are wheat, barley, 
with some land used for potatoes and   
oil seed rape.  There is also a small  
herd of cattle bred for market.  These 
farms possess many items of farm       
machinery eg. combine harvester,       
several tractors.  Fields are large.   
The soil contains much clay, making it 
difficult to work.  The 3 farms cover  
an area of 400 acres.Many of the older 
buildings are being replaced by larger,
modern buildings. The farms appear very
profitable. Mr. Lockhart (Heathley     
Farm) was interviewed: he likes the    
area and does not wish to move. He     
mentioned a good communal spirit;      
farmers help each other when necessary.
