		<title>07  THE LOST VILLAGE</title>
		<content> During 1956 a farmer was ploughing his
 field at Green farm, Shorne, when a   
 piece of 14th century coffin slab was 
 uncovered. A similar find had been    
 made 20 years before. This find led to
 the discovery of the whereabouts of   
 Merston church, part of Merston       
 village which had once been a Saxon   
 settlement. The piece of coffin slab  
 is now kept at Higham primary school. 
   Merston village was mentioned in the
 original domesday book. The remains of
 Merston church are not visible but    
 because of certain findings its exact 
 position is now known. Some tiles and 
 flints from the church can also be    
 seen. The site of the village of      
 Merston is now used as agricultural   
 land by the Lower Shorne farmers,     
 Ferry and Houghton.
