		<title>06POPULATION OF KETTLEWELL</title>
		<content>   In 1985, there are 68 men, 62 women 
 and 35 children in Kettlewell.  Eight 
 children attend Grammar Schools in    
 Skipton, some boarding,and five attend
 Upper Wharfedale Secondary School in  
 Grassington.  26 children attend      
 Kettlewell Primary School.            
   13 familes are engaged in farming.  
 Many households are engaged in        
 tourism, and in several families at   
 least one member is retired.  Some    
 residents commute daily to Skipton,   
 Grassington and Gargrave. Part-time   
 and casual workers are employed in    
 hotels etc.  Tourism is overtaking    
 agriculture as the prime industry.    
   Young married couples often have to 
 move down the Dale because of high    
 prices of cottages.  There are no     
 council houses, or low rental houses  
 available in the village.
