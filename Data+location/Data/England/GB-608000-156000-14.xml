		<content>For the interested geographer an       
intriguing dried up stream bed runs    
through Denstead Wood.It evinces a well
formed dry river valley.Although on a  
small scale this shows all the         
classical geographical signs.Higher up 
its course it meanders in a shallow    
trough about 8 metres wide by 9 to 15  
metres high.This valley reaches a peak 
further down the course when it        
reaches a depth of about 25 metres and 
a width at the bottom of 12 to 15      
metres.It is surprising to note that   
these features have been formed by a   
river that does not appear to have run 
all year.It was dry when we visited it 
in June but the leaves and branches    
found on the bends were recent and     
considerable in amount,suggesting that 
it was fairly full for quite a few     
months of the year.
