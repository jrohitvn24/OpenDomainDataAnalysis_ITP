   They have many different types and  
 styles of housing. The sides of the   
 valley are quite steep and builders   
 have had to cope with many steep      
 gradients.                            
    The houses vary in styles. There   
 are detached bungalows, three storey  
 detached houses, semi-detached houses 
 and in so many different styles       
 because there have beeen so many      
 builders.                             
    The average cost of houses at      
 present is betweeen sixty and seventy 
 thousand pounds. The lowest price     
 available is Â£49 950 and the highest  
 is Â£115 000. Builders quickly snap up 
 any land that becomes available. Even 
 to the extent of buying large plots of
 land, knocking down the original house
 and putting up two or three on the    
 same plot.                            </content>
