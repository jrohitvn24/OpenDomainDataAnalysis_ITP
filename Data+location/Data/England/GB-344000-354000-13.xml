 The instititute at Coddington is      
 alongside the church and was once a   
 school,being enlarged by an endownment
 in the will of T.Sandbach in 1887.    
    The building is now used by the    
 Women's Institute where 20 members    
 meet twice monthly. About 60 people   
 play Bingo once a month and a Whist   
 Drive is also held monthly.           
    Occasional use of the institute is 
 made by young farmers and the         
 gardening club and it is used as a    
 Polling Station.The church committee  
 meets in the building and the         
 institute will be used for services   
 whilst the church is being repaired.  
    Recent fund raising has paid for   
 central heating etc.and it is now more
 attractive for public use.
