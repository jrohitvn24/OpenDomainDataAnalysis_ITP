		<title>01Introduction to Pencombe</title>
		<content> As an example of a{green and pleasant 
 land the area around Pencombe must    
 surely be counted.The people here are 
 also pleasant and a good example of   
 this is a story recounted by Mrs M.   
 Davies,The Nash,Pencombe.The{winter of
{81/82}was very cold and after four    
 days of{blizzards and drifting}the    
 roads were impassable.In a barn with a
 large sloping roof at the Nash cattle 
 were overwintering.That evening under 
 the weight of snow the roof suddenly  
 collapsed on top of the cattle causing
 havoc and trapping several inside.One 
 phonecall to a neighbour describing   
 their plight resulted in a dozen      
 willing helpers arriving within twenty
 minutes having struggled through      
 drifts to reach them.After cutting    
 through beams with a chainsaw the     
{cattle}were safely evacuated from the 
 barn with only one injured.           </content>
