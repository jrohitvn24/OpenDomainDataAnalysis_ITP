		<content>   Most of this area is uncultivated   
 grassland.Housing comes into three    
 categories:                           
 a)Farmworkers/old retired country     
 people in cottages.                   
 b)Farmers in large well kept houses.  
 c)Non-agricultural workers who live   
 in very well kept large houses.These  
 have been converted from old cottages 
 or newly built.All with large well    
 kept gardens i.e.commuters/top jobs.  
   In the area is one pub which has a  
 passing trade (and caters for         
 families) as it is on the main        
 Warwick to Henley road.               
   The canal along this stretch is     
 not well kept.The towpath needs       
 attention as do the canal banks.It    
 is in regular use however,mainly by   
 holiday craft (not as busy as the     
 Hatton section)                       
   The area is very rural i.e.no shops.</content>
