		<content> The{village shop}is perhaps the most  
 important venue for the exchange of   
 news, views, and plain gossip. Most of
 the local inhabitants call at the shop
 each day, and make their own          
 contribution to the fund of news.     
                                       
 The school hall  is used by           
{cub-scouts,}and by{brownies}and       
{guides.}It is also used for{pantomime 
 rehearsals, by the{old people}for     
 concerts and tea-parties. Many{church 
{activities}also take place at regular 
 intervals.                            
                                       
 The local{cricket club}is a most      
 important centre for passing a        
 pleasant social afternoon. Not least  
 in popularity are the local{inns}and  
{pubs}which are frequented by locals   
 and tourists alike.
