 New Mills is on the border of North   
 Derbyshire and is also on the edge of 
 the Peak National Park. The town      
 population is about 10.5 thousand.The 
 two main groups of land cover are     
 farmland and residential. The farmland
 is mainly rough grazing. We don't grow
 crops because the land is too hilly   
 and high. We have a nature trail which
 is called the Sett Valley Trail and it
 is an old railway track. We have      
 railways,good roads and also canals.  
 The council financed a new plantation 
 of 10,000 trees recently on an old    
 refuse dump. We have also planted     
 trees next to High Lea Park to replace
 an old and dying wood. The climate in 
 New Mills is of high rainfall, and due
 to it's height above sea level, cold  
 winters.                              </content>
