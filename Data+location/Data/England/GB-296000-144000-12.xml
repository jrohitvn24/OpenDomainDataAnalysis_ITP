 There is a large proportion of people 
 living in Minehead who are            
 retired. Although many are local west 
  country people who have retired near 
  shops and the sea_front, many come   
 here from towns and cities all over   
 the country.There are different kinds 
 of housing to meet different needs.   
 Sheltered housing provides an         
 independent life with the knowledge   
 that there is a warden nearby able to 
 assist in any emergancy.              
 Nursing Home, of which there are six, 
 cater for the very elderly, sick or   
 even geriatric patients.Most of them  
 have nursing staff. Some of the homes 
 are supported financially by Churches 
 or Charities and some rely solely on  
 payments by the patients themselves or
 their relations.
