		<title>15Description of Catthorpe</title>
		<content>   Catthorpe is a small quiet village, 
 without a shop or Post Office,which   
 since 1973 has had a preservation     
 order placed on it to maintain its    
 present features.This was due to the  
 possibility of land being sold to     
 develop a new town,resulting in most  
 of the native population leaving the  
 area.Only 3 of the original families  
 remain,all of whom are farmers,the    
 other villagers having various        
 occupations outside the community.    
   There are 36 established dwellings, 
 ranging from a terraced cottage to a  
 mansion,which provide homes for a     
 fluctuating population which at the   
 moment is 111 people.                 
   To the eastern end of Main St. is a 
 small industry-Medix Ltd.-which supply
 medical equipment.
