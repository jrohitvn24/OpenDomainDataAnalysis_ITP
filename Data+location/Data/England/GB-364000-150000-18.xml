		<content> There are a number of churches in our 
 area. Chilcompton has a Church of     
 England, St John's; a Roman Catholic  
 church, St Aldhelm's and a Methodist  
 church. There was also another Church 
 of England, Christ Church, which has  
 closed down. Stratton-on-the-Fosse has
 a Church of England, St Vigor's (named
 after a saint who was supposed to have
 tamed a dragon) and a Catholic Church,
 St Benedict's.                        
 There is also the Catholic Abbey named
 after St Gregory. Lots of monks live  
 there.                                
 There are Sunday services in all the  
 churches. Confession is held in the   
 R.C. churches on Saturday. The Church 
 of England Rector has to travel       
 between the two villages to lead      
 aervices in both churches. The Family 
 Services are well attended.
