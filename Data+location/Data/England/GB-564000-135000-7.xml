		<content>    The{watermill}was built by "The    
 Great Ditch" at Hoathly in 1548 and   
 became famous as the{ironworks}that   
 made the railings and gateways of{St. 
{Pauls Cathedral}in London between 1709
 and 1741. The railings weighed about  
 200 tons. Other railings made here    
 are at Hastings, Lewes Castle and     
 Toronto in Canada. The mill owners    
 were in trouble at one time with the  
 government because the mill made      
 cannon casts for the British Navy and 
 they were smuggling them to France.   
 Part of St. Paul's railings are now   
 outside the Village Hall. The mill is 
 now a horse stud. The{Forge}was built 
 on School Hill in 1850. The{blacksmith
 said that his work varied with what   
 people paid him to do. He does gas and
 electronic welding. The furnace can   
 reach 300 degrees centigrade. He does 
 repair farm machinery and shoe horses.</content>
