		<content> Bruton was a town well supplied with  
 inns and the main reason for this     
 would have been the many travellers   
 coming through the town, needing      
 places to stay, change horses or      
 have a meal. Currently the town boasts
 four pubs - {The Castle}and {The Sun} 
 in the High Street, and  {The Royal   
{Oak}and {The Blue Bell}in Coombe      
 Street.  However, there were many     
 other pubs, and these included the    
 George, the Unicorn (on the site of   
 the National Westminster Bank), the   
 Old Bull in Patwell Street (closed in 
 1960), the Swan, the King's Arms, the 
 Crooked Fish, and the Maypole Inn at  
 the bottom of Coombe Street.  The     
 largest pub was probably the White    
 Hart, built in 1588.  It was burnt in 
 1731 and on reopening was named The   
 Blue Ball;  in 1984, the name was     
 changed to  {The Blue  Bell.          </content>
