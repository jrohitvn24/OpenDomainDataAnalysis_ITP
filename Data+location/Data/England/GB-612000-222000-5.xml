		<content> School starts at 9.20am.  Many        
 children have to travel quite long    
 distances from the outlying villages. 
 One boy said he would like to travel  
 by horse!                             
 We talked to pupils of the top two    
 classes. We were delighted to meet    
 with children who were going to the   
 same Schools as some of us, the two   
 Grammar Schools in Colchester and the 
 Ipswich GPSDT.                        
 Most families comprised four, but     
 three had five and three had EIGHT!   
 The main 'craze' for the boys was     
 computing. Several pupils owned horses
 and the girls enjoyed riding as a     
 hobby. Other hobbies incl. playing    
 musical instruments, collecting       
 stamps, coins and stickers; keeping   
 pets (one boy had 72 goldfish!); tree 
 climbing, sailing and doing magic.
