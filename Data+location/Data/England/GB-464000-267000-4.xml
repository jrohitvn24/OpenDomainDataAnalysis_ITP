		<title>04EDUCATION in EAST HADDON</title>
		<content>East Haddon is served by the village   
primary school which is Church of      
England Controlled. It follows the     
policy of the L.E.A. and admits        
children at 4+. Before this age the    
needs of the children are met by the   
village playgroup which meets twice    
weekly in the village hall. The school 
itself is old (the earliest classroom  
dating from 1790) and built out of     
local sandstone. There are three       
classes for the 64 children.The        
children are given a wide ranging      
education by the teachers.The equipment
in the school is modern - much being   
provided by the Friends of the School  
who meet regularly.The school is       
friendly and welcoming and is devoid of
the vandalism and other problems of our
time. Children are given ample         
opportunities to pursue their musical  
and dramatic interests.                </content>
