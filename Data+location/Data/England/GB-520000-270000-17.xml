 take away.There are 7 hairdressers.   
 Two are barbers and the rest are      
 unisex.There are some supermarkets and
 chemists.The main shops are in the    
 high street or the town centre.       
 There is a market every Saturday.     
 During the week the market place is   
 used as a car park.

 in Huntingdon but bulk shoppers tend  
 to travel to either the hypermarket at
 Bar Hill or to Peterborough and the   
 Queensgate centre.
