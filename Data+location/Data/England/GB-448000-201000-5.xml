		<title>05 Roads in Boars Hill area</title>
		<content>                                       
   The Boars Hill area is linked, in   
the main by country roads and lanes    
providing routes from the area to the  
adjacent towns of Abingdon and Oxford. 
   There is one major motorway (A.34)  
passing through the eastern part of the
area, this road carries heavy traffic  
between the North and South of England.
At Hinksey the A.34 links into the     
Oxford ring road designed to alleviate 
traffic congestion in the city centre. 
A park and ride system operates,       
motorists park their cars free of      
charge and travel by shuttle bus into  
the city. This service is well used at 
all times.
