		<content> I have made a survey of hobbies and   
 past times. I asked three elderly     
 people, five middle-aged people and   
 five children. Here are some of the   
 results:                              
                                       
 The most popular was sports because   
 all five{children}liked them. Then    
 collecting posters and stickers and   
 playing darts which three children    
 liked.
