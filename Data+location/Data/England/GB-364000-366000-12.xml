		<title>12 Winsford Rock Salt Mine</title>
		<content>    There is a working{Salt Mine}in    
{Winsford Cheshire.It is operated by   
 ICI Mond Division.The mine was first  
 opened in{1844}but production was     
 low until the{1950's.}                
    As motor transport increased so did
 the need for ICI rock salt to clear   
 the roads of ice and snow in winter.  
    The actual origin of the mine is   
 uncertain.When the mine was first     
 worked in the nineteenth century,picks
 and shovels were used to get the salt.
 Also, the only light down the mine was
 provided by candles. Since then many  
 improvements have been made, better   
 equipment and also better mining      
 techniques. Today Winsford rock salt  
 mine has lots of new modern equipment 
 and a special way to produce{two and a
{quarter million tons of salt per year.
