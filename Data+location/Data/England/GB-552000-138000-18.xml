 built of local sandstone by Sir George

  'Victorian Gothic' style. The stained
 glass window in the North aisle is    
 dedicated to Lord Baden Powell. The   
 vicar is the Rev. Channer.

 local community. It runs social       
 activities in the village, and        
 organises many events to raise money  
 for charity.                          
  Among the Church Groups are: The     
 Mothers' Union, Youth Groups, Sunday  
 School, and the Choir. The main       
 meeting place for church related      
 activities is the Watson Hall.        
{ST. PETER'S}in Fordcombe, was built in
 1847 for The 3rd Viscount Harding, in 
 the 'Old English' style. The rector of
 Penshurst, the Rev. Tyler_Whittle,    
 is the acting vicar.                  </content>
