		<title>14Princess Anne's Visit</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 20th March 1985,Princess 
 Anne visited the Abbey Hoisery Mills  
 for a promotion visit,to mark the end 
 of a massive expansion programme for  
 the company.                          
 They are Nuneaton's largest employer  
 with a workforce of over 1000 and the 
 annual turnover is more than Â£13      
 million.Almost all of their sales go  
 to the Marks and Spencer chain        
 operating throughout the country.     
 Princess Anne spent nearly four hours 
 looking around the massive factory and
 talking to the workers.Security for   
 the visit was high.                   
 At the end of the visit the manager   
 presented her with pyjamas and a      
 nightie for her children.             
 This was the first Royal visit to     
 the town for over 20 years,although   
 Prince Charles and Lady Diane will    
 also be visiting in July.             </content>
