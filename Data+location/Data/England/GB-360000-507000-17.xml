		<title>17ORTON - 25 YEARS AGO</title>
		<content>  Orton, 25 years ago, was really very 
 similar to what it is today. There    
 were, however, more shops - Hully's,  
 Lund's, Addison's, Rothery's,         
 Stevenson's and Roman's.The George    
 Hotel was there.The vicar in Orton was
 the Revd.James Cook.Motor cars were   
 used but they were quite different in 
 design from now-a-days.There were the 
 same roads 25 years ago.Most people   
 went for their holidays to Morecambe  
 or Blackpool; they very rarely went   
 abroad.There were two joiners in the  
 village.The popular games were tennis 
 for the girls and football for the    
 boys.The entertainment for teenagers  
 was going to the pictures and going to
 dances.There was one school which was 
 situated near the centre of the       
 village and catered for children from 
 5 to 14 years.The railway passing near
 Orton was more active.                </content>
