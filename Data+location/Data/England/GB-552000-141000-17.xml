		<content> Long nicknamed{"The Picture House",   
 this old dwelling which bears the     
 inscription 1593 WD ETA 69, was       
 originally called "Durtnolls" and was 
 probably built by William Dartnoll,   
 who was Rector from 1563-1596.        
 Edmond Woodgate died in 1678, owning  
 "The Picture House" where he appears  
 to have lived. In 1701 Edmond's       
 nephew, Thomas Woodgate - a yeoman of 
 Farningham - left to his wife, Eliza, 
 "Durtnolls" and thirty acres near     
 Pounds Bridge Mill and with him the   
 male of the "Picture House" Woodgates 
 died out. At one time the house was   
 divided into two parts, one of which  
 was used as an inn.
