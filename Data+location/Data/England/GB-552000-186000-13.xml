		<title>13QUEEN'S THEATRE</title>
		<content>      The reason we got a new Queen's  
 Theatre was that the old one was small
 and drab.                             
      The new theatre is in Billet     
 Lane.   It is only 5 minutes bus ride 
 from Hornchurch station and there are 
 plenty of car parks around.           
      There are 504 seats with 4 more  
 for people in wheelchairs.   The seats
 are built in a continental style      
 with no centre gangway.               
      The back of the stage is so deep 
 that they can hold rehearsals behind  
 the scenery.   At the front of the    
 stage is a small orchestra pit.   Six 
 dressing rooms have been provided for 
 28 players.                           
      Work started on the site during  
 January 1973 and it was opened to the 
 public on the 2nd April 1975.   It was
 opened by Peter Hall, director of the 
 National Theatre.                     </content>
