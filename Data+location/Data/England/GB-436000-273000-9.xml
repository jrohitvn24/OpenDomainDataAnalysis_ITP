		<title>09LAND USE CONFLICT</title>
		<content>{ The area's nearness to Coventry is   
{the main cause of conflict within the 
{area.}As visitors to the area have    
 differing views over how to use the   
 land than do the farmers.             
  The city seems to be constantly      
 growing outwards putting ever         
 increasing pressure on the land.      
  Townspeople look to their rural      
 surrounds to provide them with high   
 class commuter housing, land for new  
 industrial estates and land for       
 recreation. While farmers see towns as
 a threat to their livelihood.         
  There are also areas that are        
 protected as nature reserves; these   
 reserves restrict the farmer still    
 further yet are only open to the few  
 for recreation.                       
{ Land is always under pressure but    
{land that is close to cities is under 
{greater pressure.                     </content>
