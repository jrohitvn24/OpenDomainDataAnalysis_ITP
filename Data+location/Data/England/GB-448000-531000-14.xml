		<content>{3. What can children do?} There are   
 parks, pleasure gardens and other open
 spaces, some containing swings and    
 agility apparatus for children of all 
 ages in different residential areas of
 the town.  The swimming baths has an  
 Olympic size diving area as well as a 
 very shallow toddlers pool.  Youth    
 Clubs and discos are available for    
 social activities for older children. 
 Energetic children can learn          
 gymnastics, badminton and Karate by   
 joining clubs especially for these    
 sports.  Many churches have uniformed 
 organisations e.g. Boys Brigade,      
 Guides and Scouts and their junior    
 sections.                             
{4. Are there any nature walks?  }There
 are no nature walks laid out to follow
 but walking through public parks      
 provides glimpses of nature as does   
 the beach.                            </content>
