		<title>02ECOLOGY CONFLICT IN NORFOLK</title>
		<content>    East Anglia's coastal dunes and    
 wet-lands are famous for their rich   
 variety of flora and fauna.Certain    
 unique habitats are found, but there  
 has been conflict on many occasions   
 between ecological and farming        
 interests.East Norfolk's marshlands   
 traditionally provide rough grazing,  
 but also support a teeming wildlife   
 population. Many farmers have been    
 attracted by economic factors towards 
 so called 'improvements'.Such improved
 lands produce rich arable crops, but  
 also a serious simplification of      
 species .Of course many farmers take  
 an active interest in the preservation
 of wildlife ,but destruction  of      
 habitat of this kind must rank as a   
 serious ecological problem in the     
 area.
