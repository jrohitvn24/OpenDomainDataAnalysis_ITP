		<title>04CONGLETON EDGE CONTINUED</title>
		<content> One of the  dominant {geological}     
{features}of Congleton is the {scarp}  
{slope}of Congleton Edge.It is composed
 of Chatsworth grit,belonging to the   
{Namurian series}of the carboniferous }
 era.The ridge is rich with vegetation:
 chiefly{heather and deciduous trees.  
 Such vegetation is concentrated in a  
 small area of the westside of the     
 ridge acting as a natural barrier     
 between Congleton and Biddulph.The    
 farmland is put to a variety of uses: 
 dairy cattle occupy some fields;cereal
 crops are cultivated in others;and the
 rest are given to rough pasture.In    
 some parts of the ridge is evidence of
 former quarrying for sandstone.The    
 path is dotted with boulders which    
 sometimes give way to soft springy    
 peat and turf,all part of the         
 carboniferous series.
