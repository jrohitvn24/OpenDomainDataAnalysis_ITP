		<title>19Some thoughts on Newborough</title>
		<content>{ According to our survey}- about half 
 the inhabitants know that most of our 
 village is in a{Conservation Area}ie. 
 "an area of special architectural or  
 historic interest, the character and  
 appearance of which it is desirable to
 preserve or enhance".                 
{ Almost everyone}thinks that the area 
 is{beautiful}and they help to protect 
 it by honouring the{'Country Code',}  
 keeping their own properties tidy,    
 mowing grass verges and planting      
 trees. Most pick up rubbish, sweep the
 road and keep dogs under control. A   
 watch is also kept on planning.       
{ The worst eye-sores}at the moment are
 considered to be the dirty river      
 Swarbourne, a spillage of sewage water
 on the road and the waste land by the 
 brook. There are a few dilapidated    
 cottages; some modern houses built out
 of character and electricity pylons.  </content>
