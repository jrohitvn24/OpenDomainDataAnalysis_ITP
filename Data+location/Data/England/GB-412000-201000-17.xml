		<title>17LIVING IN FAIRFORD IN l985</title>
		<content>   I'm a{fifteen year old boy}and I    
 have lived all of my life in this     
 area.  I have very mixed feelings     
 about living here.  In summer I       
 wouldn't want to live anywhere else,  
 the place looks splendid with the     
 trees at their best.  Cycling or      
 walking around, going fishing in      
 nearby gravel pits all give me a sense
 of freedom in unspoilt  surroundings. 
 Winter in the area is a totally       
 different proposition.  Apart from the
 Youth Club disco on Friday evenings   
 there is not much going on for young  
 people. Consequently life becomes a   
 diet of television and homework.  Even
 so I don't think that I would change  
 my life style for a city one, the     
 summers certainly excuse everything   
 else.
