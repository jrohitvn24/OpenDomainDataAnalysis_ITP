		<content>   The roads in Stevenage seem to be   
very well designed. There are not many 
traffic jams and according to Police   
reports the number of accidents are    
low. This has been achieved by careful 
planning so that roads do not all meet 
in one central place. Instead of having
a star shaped pattern, the roads form a
series of loops. Other features which  
help the traffic to keep moving are    
special cycle tracks, lots of          
underpasses and roundabouts instead of 
traffic lights. All of these help to   
keep the traffic flowing. The town     
planners also helped when designing the
town by using the A1(M) as a sort of   
by-pass to the town and by keeping     
heavy lorries away from normal town    
roads. This was done by separating the 
industrial zones from the housing      
areas.
