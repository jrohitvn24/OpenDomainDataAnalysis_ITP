		<content> Up to about 1880 all the streets were 
 cobbled. The market was built in 1828.
 The village has lost none of its      
 character but AApledore has never been
 a place just to pass through. All     
 around are the signs of its being a   
 seaman's village. When the old wooden 
 saling ships were broken up, good     
 timbers were kept for building into   
 the houses. The little street called  
 "Factory Opie", running down to the   
 quay got its name from a malt factory.
 The population, i 1984, was 2,135. In 
 olden days, the houses were all built 
 along the river, but as the vullage   
 has grown, development has spread     
 above the river. Today the shipyard   
 builds modern vessels in the covered  
 yard and the population has grown     
 as more work has become available.
