		<content>  We have found out that we all get up 
 at different times. We get up between 
 6am and 8am. We wash and dress        
 ourselves and have some{ breakfast}in 
 the morning. Some of us walk to       
 school, others travel by taxi or      
 minibus.                              
  There are five schools in our town.  
 Secondary school children work from   
 8.45 to 12.45 and younger children    
 from 9 until 12 in the{morning.}      
 Primary children work 1 until 3 in the
{afternoon}and the older children from 
 1.45 to 3.45.Most of us have a hot    
 meal or sandwiches in school at       
 midday.We have a mid morning break.   
{ After school}we play records or      
 tapes,ride bikes, go to the park, walk
 the dog,play on our computers, read   
 books and watch television.At the end 
 of the day we go up stairs to our own 
 bedrooms and read before we sleep.    </content>
