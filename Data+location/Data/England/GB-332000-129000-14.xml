		<content> Electricity and piped water are       
 available to all the houses but most  
 depend on septic tank drainage. People
 who want to cook with gas have to use 
 bottled gas.                          
 The nearest hospital with a casualty  
 department is East Reach Hospital at  
 Taunton. There is no doctor or dentist
 in the area.                          
 In emergencies the fire engine,       
 ambulance or police car would have to 
 come from either Taunton or           
 Bridgwater.                           
 The roads are maintained by Somerset  
 County Council. The A361 Taunton to   
 Glastonbury road passes through       
 Burrowbridge. The nearest Motorway is 
 the M5 which can be reached by driving
 through Moorland and Huntworth. The M5
 will take you to Bristol in one       
 direction and Plymouth in the other.
