		<title>01Capel St Mary and Bentley</title>
		<content>The area covered by this survey is     
mainly mixed farmland mainly arable.   
The area is divided by the A12 dual    
carriageway Capel St Mary being to the 
west of it and Bentley a mile and a    
half to the East.                      
Both villages have expanded since the  
late Fifties,Capel St Mary having      
multiplied tremendously whereas Bentley
has only doubled in size.              
The majority of the population works in
either Ipswich 5 miles to the north or 
Colchester 15 miles to the south.Some, 
however,work locally and a few         
commute to London daily.
