		<content> An interview with the Administrator of
 Roundway hospital in Devizes.         
 The Hospital was built in 1851 and it 
 now has 20 wards and there are 525    
 patients. There are 138 acres of land 
 belonging to the hospital, which is   
 less than it used to be because they  
 have sold off a lot of it.There are   
 386 nurses in the hospital but they   
 all do different jobs. There are 86   
 cleaners and there are 32 doctors.    
 The Hospital deals with Psychiatric   
 patients from the age of sixteen years
 upward and it costs Â£6,500,000 a year 
 to run.                               
 Sometimes the patients get bad        
 tempered but the doctors, nurses or   
 sisters calm them down. The biggest   
 ward has 36 beds.                     
 Mr.Coles was 44 when he started work  
 in 1975.
