		<title>13TRANSPORT IN FYLINGDALES</title>
		<content> We surveyed one hundred families in   
 School to find what transport each    
 used. We found that 12% had no car.   
 The others did, some having one       
 vehicle and a few families having two 
 or three cars.                        
 One family owned seven bicycles and   
 that was the largest number. 20% had  
 two bicycles but there were eight     
 families which did not own a machine. 
 83% of the families have no           
 motor-bikes. A few families have one  
 machine and four had two.             
 25% of the families have used the     
 train to get to their holiday         
 destination.                          
 34% of the families have flown to     
 other countries and 44% have travelled
 on a liner or a ferry to another      
 country.
