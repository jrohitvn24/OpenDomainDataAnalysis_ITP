		<content> The Hudawi Centre - Huddersfield Afro 
 West Indian Centre - was once a Junior
 School. When the surrounding area was 
 cleared of much of its housing the    
 school became a Civic Youth Club and  
 headquarters for the Caribbean        
 Association.  At the time of council  
 cuts Youth Club closed and the        
 building became very dilpidated. The  
 Caribbean Ass. and Black Unity applied
 for an Urban Aid Grant. It now houses 
 a Drop In Centre, Self Aid Scheme:-   
 woodwork room, sign writing, sewing,  
 tailoring./for unemployed W.I.There is
 also a B.B.C. computer, video making, 
 recording studio.  Various Caribbean  
 groups use the centre and a Steel Band
 practices there.                      
 Hudawi will also be the centre for    
 next year's Caribbean Focus.
