		<content> village'.  Main sewerage and          
 electricity were connected and both   
 private and public housing built.  The
 population doubled and the village    
 became dormitory to{Coventry}and      
{Leamington.                           
 Geographically, the parish is         
 contained in a saucer-shaped          
 depression on the line between the{   
{Cotswolds}and the{Avon valley.}The    
 Itchen's extensive meanders produce   
 well-watered grassland:  the higher   
 sandy ground is ploughed.             
 The village is a pleasant mixture     
 of old and new both in buildings and  
 population; very self-contained, its  
 older families rather insular.  The   
 bus service is very restricted and    
 non-car families can feel rather      
 trapped.  The 'new' villagers came in 
 mostly from the Coventry and          
 Leamington areas during the 196Os.    </content>
