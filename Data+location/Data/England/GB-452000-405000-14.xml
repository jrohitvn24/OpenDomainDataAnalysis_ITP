		<content>{ Touch Down}is a chasing game.About   
 six people are on and two or three are
 being chased.You have to play on grass
 or you will hurt yourself.The idea is 
 to catch people and trip them or push 
 them over.Nobody wins and nobody loses
 and it is quite rough.It is mostly    
 girls chasing boys or boys chasing    
 girls.                                
{ Farmer,Farmer}has one person who is  
 on, he is the farmer.The other people 
 are pupils.They have to say,"{Farmer, 
{Farmer}please may we cross your golden
 bridge?". The Farmer will say,"Only if
 you are wearing green." or some other 
 colour that he chooses. If you are    
 wearing that colour then you can cross
 safely without being chased, otherwise
 you have to struggle across and avoid 
 the Farmer. If you are caught you     
 become the Farmer.{ }
