		<title>13SCHOOLS OF WEST HULL</title>
		<content> The area contains 6 Senior schools,   
 5 Junior schools, 9 Primary Schools   
 and 1 Nursery. The present system of  
 education in  Hull involves 3 stages  
 of schooling: Primary from 5_9; Junior
 schools from 9_13; Senior Schools     
 from 13_18. The East Riding also has 3
 stages but the ages of children in    
 each school are slightly different:   
 Infant from 5_7; Junior from 7_11;    
 Senior from 11_18. It is intended that
 the Hull system will be reorganised in
 1988 to create a system similar to    
 that of the East Riding. The ultimate 
 aim of this is to cut down local      
 goverment expenditure. Most children  
 get to school by car, bike or on foot.
 A day starts at 9am and ends at       
 3:30_4pm. Lessons are throughout the  
 day with 2 breaks and 1 long dinner   
 break.                                
                                       </content>
