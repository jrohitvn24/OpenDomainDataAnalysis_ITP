    I started Wrestling when I was 9   
 years old. In the 3 years I have been 
 wrestling I have won the best young   
 wrestler award twice,and the school   
 cup once, and came second in the under
 14's and 16's. The Cawley's  are the  
 trainers, Jerry Cawley is the         
 heavy weight champion of Cornwall. In 
 Cornish wrestling the most common     
 throw is a back, where you need 2 hips
  and 1 shoulder on the floor. This is 
 a winning throw. The referees are     
 called sticklers, and are former      
 wrestlers.We practise on the playing  
 field once or twice a week.           </content>
