  The walls of the church are of       
 herringbone masonry thought to be     
 Saxon. There is more of this type of  
 masonry in Kippax church than in any  
 other church in the country with the  
 exception of Burghwallis near         
 Doncaster. The porch is not bonded to 
 the original building it was possible 
 added in the 18th century. The        
 rectangular measures 13'2" East to    
 West and 11'0" North to South. It     
 contains too deep splayed round headed
 windows which have been renewed on the
 outside. The tower contains a ring of 
 six bells including 3 old ones dated  
 1636 and 1638. These were later       
 re_cast and re_hung along with new    
 ones in 1946.
