 The area consisting of 12 1km x 1km   
 squares was divided into blocks of    
 three squares and each school studied 
 these squares,also writing pages of   
 text on subjects which they felt to be
 of interest or importance.            
                                       
 Hopefully those reading this          
 information in the future will        
 remember the haste with which it was  
 prepared(BBC deadlines and school     
 holidays) and the difficulties        
 encountered in co-ordinating the whole
 project.   {Chris Thatcher}
