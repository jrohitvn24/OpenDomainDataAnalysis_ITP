		<content> Beverley Panthers are a Youth Rugby   
 League Club.  Boys under              
 fourteen,under twelve and under ten   
 can play.                             
      We train at the Beverley Grammar 
 School every Wednesday.  In the summer
 we train outside but in the winter we 
 train in  the gymnasium.  We practice 
 passing the ball and tackling.        
      Our team strip is coloured       
 burgundy and gold.  The teams are     
 sponsored by Fiveways Cafe and        
 P.Brumby, a local plumber.            
      We went on a Rugby tour to       
 Barrow-in -Furness and played one game
 but lost 18-4.  We came in the top    
 five in the league and had a          
 presentation night, where we had small
 and large trophies presented by       
 professional players from Hull F.C.   
 and Hull Kingston Rovers.
