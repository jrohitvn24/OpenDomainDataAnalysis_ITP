		<content> There are a number of established     
 farms in the area.  The main{crops}are
 wheat, barley and rape.               
                                       
 At Cross Weir Farm{sheep and pigs}are 
 reared for their meat.  At Middle Farm
 and at Bencroft Farm sheep and{cattle 
 are raised for meat.                  
                                       
 Goosey's Lodge, originally a farm, is 
 now a{meat refrigeration}plant        
 operating under the name of Chettles. 
 As a sideline they use rotting offal  
 to breed maggots for anglers.         
                                       
 There is no{dairy farming}in the area 
 although one or two people keep goats}
 for their own milk supply.            
                                       
 This survey was carried out by members
