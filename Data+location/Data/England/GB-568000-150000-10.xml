		<title>10SHOPPING &amp; EATING IN YALDING</title>
		<content>                                       
 Although many people drive to         
 Maidstone supermarkets to shop, both  
 Nettlestead and Yalding support shops.
 Those at Yalding sell greengroceries  
 as well as groceries and frozen food. 
 There is a garden centre at           
 Nettlestead and at Yalding the village
 forge still shoes horses as well as   
 producing wrought ironwork and        
 undertaking welding. Marinas at       
 Yalding and Wateringbury are busy in  
 summer, as are local cafes. Hampstead 
 Cafe, Yalding, caters also for drivers
 and is open all year. In recent years 
 it has become the custom that where   
 possible public houses should offer a 
 service of bar snacks to increase     
 trade and this is so in our area. Some
 also offer restaurant service.
