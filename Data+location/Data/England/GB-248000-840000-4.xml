		<title>04SHINTY-A HIGHLAND GAME</title>
		<content> In Kiltarlity we have a sport called  
{shinty}.You use a club which is shaped
 like a hockey stick but you can hit   
 with both sides .The shinty ball is a 
 cork or string centre and a leather   
 casing and is the same size as a      
 tennis ball. There are twelve players 
 in a team.                            
 Lovat shinty club has been around for 
 over one hundred years.Lord Lovat is  
 the chief of the Lovat shinty club.   
 The game looks wilder than hockey     
 because you can swing over your head  
 and you are allowed to turn your back 
 on your opponent.                     
 Shinty's Gaelic name is camanachd and 
 the club is called a caman.The sport  
 is completely amateur.                
 Lovat shinty club have teams for      
 adults and juveniles.This year the    
 primary school team and the under 14  
 team were cup winners.                </content>
