		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content>  It is bordered to the south by the   
 River Thames,to the east by the area  
 known as West Thurrock,to the north by
 the new A13 dual carriageway with     
 interchange to the M25 motorway,and   
 to the west by part of the village of 
 Purfleet.                             
  It incorporates some of the          
 industrial area that runs along the   
 banks of the Thames,ranging from light
 industry to petroleum storage,river   
 berths and a large power station.     
  Much of the area is disused chalk    
 quarries,some of which are being      
 redeveloped for industry and          
 recreation,others are in various      
 stages of natural colonisation.There  
 is talk of siting a new town within   
 some of these quarries,complete with  
 a new railway station.                
  The northern area has some           
 agricultural usage,mainly pastural.   </content>
