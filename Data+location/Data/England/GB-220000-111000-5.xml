		<content> The streams that flow in our block are
 stoney and  brown trout and eels breed
 in the upper reaches. Many insects    
 including the dragonfly hatch in them.
                                       
 All the  tributaries  meet  at {Coombe
{Valley}where  the stream  with no name
 meanders down to{Duckpool}and the sea.
 Many of  the farms  and homes  in  the
 block rely  exclusively  on  wells for
 their water.  Some are  shallow spring
 wells built  into the  hillside.  They
 are made of  local stone with a wooden
 door on  the side  and a  slate  ledge
 where the butter and cream were kept. 
 Others are vertical not ususally  deep
 with a coventional  lid on top.  Farms
 that require more water dig bore holes
 In the last  two summers  we have  had
 very  little  rain, wells  and springs
 dried up  and homes  with mains  water
 had very little pressure.             </content>
