		<title>03CROOKHAM : AMENITIES</title>
		<content> Despite its small size and population 
 Crookham Village is favoured with good
 amenities. The inn is well patronised 
 by young people travelling in by car. 
 There is a social club built in 1920  
 where discos and dances take place.   
 The annual children's Christmas party 
 is held there. A miming play is       
 performed outside the club every      
 Boxing Day and a local fete is held in
 June every year. The village shop,    
 Post Office and newsagents as well as 
 the nearby farm shop have good local  
 trade, especially as the bus service  
 only runs twice a day. Crookham       
 Village is twinned with Levignon,     
 France and exchange visits take place 
 between the two villages.
