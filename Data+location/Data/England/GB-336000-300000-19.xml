		<content> A study of the Mytton Dingle showed   
 the following land-cover observations:
 At{255m}above sea-level the main land-
 cover was fern, grass and broom.      
 At{265m}it was still fern and broom   
 but the grass was much finer and more 
 wind-resistant.                       
 At{275m}it was broom fern and gorse   
 and the occasional tree.              
 At{300m}heather was predominant with  
 occasional very stunted gorse bushes  
 and some fern in sheltered hollows.   
 At {350m}it was about 70% heather and 
 25% whimberry.                        
 Unusual wild flowers seen in the area 
 include{sheep's bit, navelwort, white 
{foxgloves, birdsfoot trefoil, cowslip 
 and{butterfly orchid.                 
 Mammals sighted locally include{foxes,
{badgers, weasels}and{pine martens.    
 Birds seen locally include{buzzards,  
{grouse, little owls}and{kestrels.     </content>
