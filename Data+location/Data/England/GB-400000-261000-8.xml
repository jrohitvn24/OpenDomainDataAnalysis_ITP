		<title>08FECKENHAM WAKE</title>
		<content>  The Wake was originally held to      
 celebrate the granting of a charter by
 Henry the second. It is held annually 
 on the nearest Sunday to the 24th     
 June. Years ago the Wake took the form
 of a market on the green. There is    
 mention of a large black bear being   
 present.                              
  At the begining of this century the  
 Wake took the form of a fair and it   
 moved onto a local field as the green 
 was not large enough. There were swing
 boats, rounderbout horses and a       
 coconut  shy.                         
  These days the Wake is still held    
 every year. It has now moved back to  
 its original site on the village      
 green. It has stalls of local produce,
 flowers and games. The great          
 attraction for the children this year 
 was a bouncy castle.
