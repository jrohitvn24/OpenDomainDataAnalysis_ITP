		<title>16The Petworth Festival</title>
		<content> The Petworth Feastival is an English  
 Festival of music and art. The        
 Festival happens every year, and in   
 1985 it was on 15th-23rd June. There  
 were musical evenings and lunchtime   
 concerts. Music of all kinds was      
 featured, from Handel's music to      
 celebrate the 300th anniversary of his
 birth, to jazz in the Park on the last
 night. There was a young art          
 exhibition upstairs at the Leconfield 
 Hall and Andy Wood displayed some of  
 his paintings downstairs. The Sealed  
 Knot Society turned the clock back to 
 the Civil War on 22nd June. We        
 enjoiyed a spectacular display of     
 flying kites and model aircraft at the
 Kite Festival in the Park on the 23rd 
 June.
