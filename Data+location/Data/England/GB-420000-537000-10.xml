		<title>10A FARMER</title>
		<content> The family have owned 4 farms in the  
 North East since 1885 and is known by 
 all inhabitants of Brandon. Beef      
 cattle and Suffolk cross fat lambs are
 bred to be sold in Newcastle. 50% of  
 arable land is grassland to feed      
 animal stock and 50% is for crops. 80%
 of wheat is sold to Spillers,         
 Newcastle for baking;"feed" wheat(20%)
 is used for fattening animals. Barley 
 is sold for malting, but if it is not 
 good enough then it is used for animal
 feed. Oil seed rape, used in Britain  
 due to E.E.C. encouragement, produces 
 vegetable oil. It is a bright yellow  
 crop, flowering in early June and Mr. 
 Harle regards it as a good crop       
 because it does not take many         
 nutrients from the soil. Winter oats  
 and swedes fatten the animals and some
 potatoes are sold locally.
