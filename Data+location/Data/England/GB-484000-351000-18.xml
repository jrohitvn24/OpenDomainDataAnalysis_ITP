		<title>18Sutton-cum-Beckingham(Lincs)</title>
		<content>  A  small hamlet which  is  affiliated
 to Beckingham with seven houses dotted
 along a lane  about half  a  mile long
 which is part of the old coaching road
 from Newark to Sleaford.              
  We have  mains water and electricity,
 a  daily  postal service and a  weekly
 refuse disposal service from Lincoln. 
  There is no mains drainage system and
 sewage disposal has been done by North
 Kesteven District Council for the last
 36 years  but we have just received  a
 letter saying that this service is now
 being put out to private tender.      
  There is  no  shop  but a baker's van
 and a greengrocer's van  come down the
 lane each week.                       
  Some 31 years  ago  the  then  oldest
 inhabitant could remember a time  when
 there  were  about 20 houses and a pub
 down the lane but there is no  visible
 trace of these buildings today.       </content>
