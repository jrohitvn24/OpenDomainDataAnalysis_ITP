		<content>   The famine in Africa.               
    Almost everyone we spoke to said   
 how much the B.B.C.film report from   
 Ethiopia had upset them.              
  The news from Africa has not improved
 very much and most people appeared    
 shocked that this sort of tragedy can 
 occur in 1985.                        
   Some of our mums had done something 
 themselves to try to help.There had   
 been some coffee mornings, wine and   
 cheese parties and many varied        
 sponsored events.Many other people had
 just sent money to the various        
 charities which have been helping     
 the peoples of East Africa.           
   The pop stars have done a lot to    
 help with this problem. We think      
 everybody should help because we are  
 all heaps better off than any of the  
 people we saw on our television.
