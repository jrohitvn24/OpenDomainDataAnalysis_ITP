		<title>15KEEPING A PET</title>
		<content> Most people these days like to keep a 
 pet of some kind.  The most popular   
 pets are dogs, but people also keep   
 horses, cats, guinea pigs, mice,      
 snakes, gerbils and many other types  
 of animal. I have a Welsh Border      
 Collie called Sheena. I have had      
 Sheena for nearly seven years now. I  
 walk her about two miles most nights; 
 she really enjoys it. She loves       
 playing football on the beach as well.
 Sheena's diet consists mainly of fresh
 meat and biscuits. If we don't have   
 any fresh meat she is given 'Minced   
 Morsels'.  She will not eat any tinned
 meat. Sheena is not able to have any  
 puppies because she was born with a   
 disease called hip displasia and she  
 had to be spayed when she was 14      
 months old.  I think everyone who can 
 should have a pet of some kind.
