		<title>04The Parish Church part 1</title>
		<content>   The church of St.Andrew is the      
 parish church of Much Hadham. Although
 originally built in the 12th century, 
 the present building dates mainly from
 the 13th-15th centuries. The Chancel, 
 Nave and South Aisle were built in the
 13th century and the North Aisle in   
 the 14th century.                     
   The church has a tower which was    
 built in 1382-1404. It is in three    
 stages and is surmounted by a large   
 spire. The clerestory, rooves and     
 South porch were added in the 15th    
 century, when many of the windows were
 renewed. The West door at the base of 
 the tower is distinguished by carvings
 of a king and queen, by Mr. Henry     
 Moore who lives in the village.       
   The Rector in 1985 is Rev. Michael  
 MacAdam, who is also Chairman of the  
 Governors of the village primary      
 school.                               </content>
