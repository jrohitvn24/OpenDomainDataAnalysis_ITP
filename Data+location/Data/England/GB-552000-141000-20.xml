		<title>20Poem of Penshurst</title>
		<content> Penshurst is a village                
           where all the children play.
 They have a grand adventure playground
          to amuse themselves each day.
 Penshurst is full of History.         
 It's like the olden days.             
 It still has an old Blacksmithy       
 Though it's past its blacksmiths ways.
 Penshurst has a landmark              
 So tourists aren't all that rare.     
 It's Penshurst Place with all its     
                              splendour
 And its country game fair.            
 Penshurst has lush green grass        
 And healthy swaying trees.            
 The beautiful coloured flowers.       
 The humming of the bees.              
 I do love living near Penshurst.      
 It's such a brilliant place.          
 And if I turn to kids terms.          
 I guess its really{ACE!!!
