		<title>03The start of Mark's day</title>
		<content>    It is 8'o clock. My mum says its   
 time to get up. I think "Oh no, it's  
 school! Boring old assembly." So I say
 I am not well, but my mum has heard it
 all before.                           
    When I finally get out of bed I go 
 down stairs. I get my breakfast. Mum  
 says, "Here's your cornflakes and     
 tea." After getting dressed I go to   
 have a wash.                          
    Next I go to the bus stop with Paul
 Wright. We talk about last night's    
 television."It was good in the"A Team"
 when that car crashed into the truck."
 Paul told me a joke. "What did the    
 cross-eyed teacher say?" "I don't     
 know." "She said I can't control my   
 pupils!"                              
    I mostly take 20p to school and get
 a packet of fruit gums. When I get    
 into the school playground I play with
 Andrew or talk about computers.       </content>
