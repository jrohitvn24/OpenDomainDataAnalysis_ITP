		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF PENNY</title>
		<content> In the morning I usually get up at    
 about 7 o'clock. I go down for        
 breakfast and have hot milk and bran  
 flakes and sometimes coffee. I go     
 upstairs to get dressed. Often I      
 can't open the drawer. I go to school 
 _ my mum takes me. I have about half  
 an hours play. At 9 o'clock we go in  
 for assembly,after that we do maths   
 and reading.At playtime we play yellow
 lines.Someone is "on" and you have to 
 keep to the lines.Before lunch we     
 often do writing. In the afternoon    
 we sometimes do art and craft.At half 
 past three we go home and I watch all 
 the childrens programmes on television
 till 6 o'clock. I have my tea then I  
 watch "Wogan". I go in the bath and at
 8 o'clock I go to bed.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
