		<content> Although this area is now well served 
 by excellent roads, is close to       
 Humberside Airport at Kirmington, and 
 the major Humber port of Immingham,   
 the inhabitants are extremely poorly  
 served by Public transport. The Lin-  
 colnshire Road Car Company limited,   
 a subsidiary of the National Bus Co.  
 is the main bus operator. The 450     
 route with 4 return journeys daily    
 from Lincoln via Brigg to Hull passes 
 through the Barnetby intersection and 
 along the A15 North.The 850 route be- 
 tween Grimsby and Hull uses the A15   
 with 3 return journeys daily.But it   
 must be stressed that neither service 
 sets down or picks up in the square.  
 All inhabited houses are between 1    
 and 3.5 miles from a bus stop.For all 
 intents and purposes either to work or
 live in this area requires a means    
 of private transport.                 </content>
