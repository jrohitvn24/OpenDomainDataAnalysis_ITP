    We were{2,000 to 2,500 feet above  
{ground level,}looking down on what    
 seemed to be a model village. We could
 see the{River Tees}meandering around  
 the cramped Yarm houses and shops,    
 lining the High Street. We could just 
 see a few moving cars.                
    Neat, compact clumps of{trees}were 
 scattered around the district, with   
{farms and fields}nearby. The colours  
 ranged from yellow-browns to various  
 greens, depending on the crops being  
 grown. The strong winds had a rippling
 effect on the long grasses.           
    As we travelled further North, we  
 saw our school sports field and the   
{railway.}In the distance were blocks  
 of flats with the{Cleveland Hills}    
 rising behind them. Even at this      
 height, we could still see an         
 interesting range of land uses.       </content>
