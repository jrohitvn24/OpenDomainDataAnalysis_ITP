		<title>01 Our Block in West Stafford.</title>
		<content> Our school,Highfield Grove Middle,    
has been given west Stafford to        
investigate. Stafford(pop 50,000) is a 
county town situated in the West       
Midlands, on the river Sow. Our        
block is 3Km by 4Km,including the      
western part of the town,and the       
adjoining rural areas.                 
The rural area includes one  main      
village called Derrington and one      
small village north of Derrington      
called Aston.There are also several    
hamlets and fifteen farms.Around       
Derrington the land is used mainly for 
growing crops and grazing land for     
animals.         In the built up       
area, including the suburbs,which are  
Doxey,  Western Downs,Castletown and   
Highfields there are lots of houses,   
schools,some factories and part of     
the town.Stafford castle is well worth 
a visit.                               </content>
