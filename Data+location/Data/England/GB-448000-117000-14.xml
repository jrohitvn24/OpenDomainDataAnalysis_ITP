		<title>14SOCIAL MEDICINE IN FAIR OAK</title>
		<content>    Much specialist advice and help is 
 given at the Stoke Wood Surgery. Home 
 visits are made by 4 health visitors,2
 midwives and 2 district nurses.       
    Family planning advice,psychiatric 
 help,general health advice as well as 
 acupuncture are available. Informal   
 chats about problems are readily      
 offered.                              
    All records are computer recorded  
 so an efficient monitoring system     
 ensures that patients are made aware  
 of any treatment, e.g.vaccinations    
 that is due. The area being largely   
 agricultural there is an especially   
 high tetanus rate.                    
    As Fair Oak is an expanding area   
 there is a predominance of young      
 patients. The Surgery currently treats
 1300 patients under 5 years. It also  
 has1046 patients aged between 65 and  
 74.                                   </content>
