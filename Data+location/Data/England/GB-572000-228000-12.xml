		<content>       With the exception of two       
 members of the P.C.C.,{St Andrew's    
{Church Shalford,}relies on lay members
 to organise this event, at the{Village
{Hall.}Annually, busy parishioners     
 manage to produce an interesting and  
 enjoyable event.                      
      On the playing field, the        
 vaulting horse competes for custom    
 with pony rides, bowling, cycling and 
 fishing, while the fortune teller     
 deals with her expectant queue (all   
 ladies).                              
      The cake stall could be compared 
 to the finest professional patisserie 
 with the sweet smell of home baking.  
 The book stall  is popular. All ages  
 find "treasures". Items from the White
 Elephant stall find new homes. There  
 are queues for tombola and cream teas.
 After the raffle is drawn we go home, 
 giving thanks for a fine day.         </content>
