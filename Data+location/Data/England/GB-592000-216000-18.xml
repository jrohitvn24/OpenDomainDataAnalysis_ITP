		<title>18THE PIGS</title>
		<content> This is a poem which I wrote when I   
 got back from Park House Farm, Layer  
 Marney. It describes how the pigs     
 live, and how smelly they are.        
                                       
                                       
 In a rented barn,                     
 there are some pigs sploshing about   
 in the mud.                           
 I fed them straw,                     
 but that was their bed.               
 I got splashed with mud,              
 so did someone else.                  
 I knew pigs were smelly,              
 but they were worse than I thought.
