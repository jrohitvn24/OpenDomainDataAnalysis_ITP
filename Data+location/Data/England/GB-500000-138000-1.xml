		<title>01Hascombe &amp; area to the east</title>
		<content> This is a prosperous farming area with
 much woodland &amp; beautiful countryside.
 There is evidence of field sports     
 particularly pheasant shooting &amp; horse
 riding.  The small village of Hasombe 
 lies to the west of the area below    
 Hascombe hill, where a herd of white  
 deer graze. Haxcombe vineyard is on   
 the southerly slopes of the hill.  In 
 the south east corner is Nanhurst - a 
 large house which is owned by BUPA and
 run as a boarding school for children 
 from five to fifteen years old with   
 learning difficulties.  Smithbrook    
 kilns on the A281, disused brick      
 works, have recently been developed   
 into craft centres and tight          
 industrial works with a teashop.
