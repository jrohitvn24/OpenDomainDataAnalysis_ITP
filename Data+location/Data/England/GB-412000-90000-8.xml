		<title>08OIL SURVEY IN CHRISTCHURCH</title>
		<content>   ON THE 20TH OCTOBER, 1985 SIX GREY  
 LORRIES CAME OUTSIDE OUR GATE TESTING 
 FOR OIL IN STONY LANE, CHRISTCHURCH.  
 THEY SENT SHOCK WAVES DOWN INTO THE   
 GROUND AND WHEN THE WAVES CAME UP     
 AGAIN A MAN TOOK A READING. WHEN THEY 
 SENT THE SHOCK WAVES DOWN THE HOUSE   
 SHOOK.   MY DAD SAYS THERE IS OIL     
 UNDER OUR HOUSE.  IF THERE WAS WE     
 WOULD HAVE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER HOUSE   
 BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS IT.  IF  
 IT WAS OUR OWN PROPERTY WE WOULD STILL
 HAVE TO MOVE.                         
   OIL COMPANIES HAVE FOUND QUITE A LOT
 OF OIL IN DORSET AND THEY ARE ALREADY 
 EXTRACTING IT.  SOME LOCAL PEOPLE ARE 
 WORRIED THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO       
 POLLUTION. THE COUNCIL ARE STILL      
 TRYING TO DECIDE ON THE BEST WAY TO   
 TRANSPORT THE OIL, BY PIPELINE, TRAIN 
 OR BY OIL TANKER.
