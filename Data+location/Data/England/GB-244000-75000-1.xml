		<content> At 07.30 I wake up and get dressed in 
 to my school uniform.I wear black     
 trousers,a grey jumper,a teeshirt,    
 pants and socks. I go downstairs and  
 have my breakfast_usually Sugar Puffs.
 My dad leaves for work in a taxi.     
 After he has gone I put my trainers on
 and walk to school at 08.30. At school
 I go out to play for 10 minutes and   
 then I come in and do Maths, Language 
 and Reading until 10.30.Then we go out
 to play until 10.50.When I come in I  
 do a variety of work.At 12.00 we have 
 lunch.There is usually salad and some 
 sort of potato and hot meal.At 13.15  
 we do more work until 15.15 when it is
 home time.After school I go out to    
 play until 16.00.I watch television   
 until 18.30, have tea,then watch      
 television again until 20.30, when I  
 go upstairs, clean my teeth, and go to
 bed.                                  </content>
