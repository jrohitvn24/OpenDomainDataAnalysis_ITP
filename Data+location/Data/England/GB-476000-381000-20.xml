		<content> The information describing North      
 Leverton was obtained from approx. 70 
 children/adults, mostly during school 
 lessons. The LIFE-STYLE entry was     
 written by 10 year old children. The  
 village of 800, live in modern houses 
 and work in modern conditions in the  
 Trent side Power Stations or on       
 farms. Farming is highly mechanised,  
 using large fields, growing mainly    
 cereals. Factory farming for eggs has 
 replaced the hens in the back yard or 
 orchard. There is no commercial centre
 in the village because most of the    
 shopping is done at surrounding towns.
 The windmill grinds corn which is sold
 as flour to the thousands of visitors 
 who enjoy watching the working mill.  
 The mill is supported by the Friends  
 of Leverton Windmill.
