		<title>14A HIGH SALVINGTON RESIDENT</title>
		<content> I get up at 9am on Saturday,have      
 breakfast,then go into Worthing for   
 shopping as the only shop in our area 
 is expensive.We only use it for       
 'top-up' supplies.After lunch,I go for
 a walk over the Downs,the path being  
 20m away from our house.Then I go back
 home to watch television.This area is 
 ideal for my friends and me to enjoy  
 the traffic-free safety of the        
 unspoilt countryside.After watching   
 television until 4.30pm,I cycle down  
 Salvington Hill to the A27,through    
 Durrington down to Offington where my 
 friend lives-a dangerous route with   
 much traffic.I get home around 7pm,   
 have tea,watch television until 10pm, 
 and then to bed.I cannot hear much    
 traffic through my bedroom window,    
 only countryside sounds.
