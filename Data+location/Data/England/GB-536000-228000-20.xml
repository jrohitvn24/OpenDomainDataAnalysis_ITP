		<title>20Sainsbury Depot,Buntingford</title>
		<content> In the 1950s, J. Sainsbury's grocery  
 chain moved its distribution depot    
 from Blackfriars to Buntingford.In    
 1968 the  company built a large       
 warehouse, housing-estates to         
 accomodate workers moving from London,
 and extensive sports and leisure      
 facilities. By 1985 the "overspill"   
 population has quite assimilated the  
 local way of life.                    
  The depot serves Sainsbury stores    
 throughout East Anglia, the East      
 Midlands and North London. It employs 
 about 700 people and runs a fleet of  
 100 lorries.                          
  Suppliers deliver their goods to     
 Buntingford, for redistribution. A    
 computerised system sends each store's
 needs to Head Office every evening.   
 The information is transmitted to the 
 depots, loads are made up and the     
 stores are resupplied by next morning.</content>
