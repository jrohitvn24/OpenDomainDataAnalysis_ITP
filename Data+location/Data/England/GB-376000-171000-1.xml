		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF MARSHFIELD</title>
		<content>                                       
 This compact grey stone village lies  
 in the countryside 600ft high in the  
 South Cotswolds.  The main street,    
 from medieval church to the Almshouses
 a mile to the west, is lined with a   
 continuous frontage of houses, none   
 alike.  A school with belfry, 3 inns, 
 shops, businesses, surgery and Post   
 Office are scattered among them.      
 Private housing estates are confined  
 on the north by the 1967 Bypass.      
 There is a council estate and         
 recreation ground.  To the south,     
 stone walled fields slope down to     
 St. Catherine's Valley.  This area is 
 farmland, mainly grazing and arable,  
 with some woodland.  In the small,    
 closely knit, friendly and active     
 community newcomers, many of whom     
 commute to Bath or Bristol, soon      
 become integrated.                    </content>
