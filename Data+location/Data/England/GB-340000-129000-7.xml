		<title>07THE PRIMARY SCHOOL,HIGH HAM</title>
		<content> Built in 1865, the school has 100     
 children aged 4-11 years divided into 
 4 classes. A fifth teacher works 4    
 mornings, and an ancilliary for 15    
 hours a week. School meals, swimming  
 pool &amp; cricket net are provided. Staff
 and parents have greatly improved the 
 school and raise Â£2,000 each year,    
 which matches the L.E.A. allocation.  
 The curriculum is extensive, including
 several sports, French, dancing,      
 computer &amp; environmental studies, in  
 addition to the basics. After school  
 clubs are offered each evening in     
 athletics,swimming,football,netball &amp; 
 cricket. Camps and trips are organised
 and a French class joins the school   
 each year. Parents are encouraged to  
 be partners in teaching the children. 
 The Village School is dying out and is
 greatly respected &amp; protected for all 
 the advantages it gives the children. </content>
