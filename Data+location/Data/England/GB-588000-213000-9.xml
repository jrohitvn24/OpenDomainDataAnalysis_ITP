		<title>09Grange Farm,Tiptree</title>
		<content> I went to Grange Farm to do an        
 interview.It is along Grange Road in  
 the West part of Tiptree.Tiptree is   
 famous for its strawberries.Grange    
 Farm has grown strawberries since     
 1930.From 1884 strawberries have been 
 grown on that land but it was called  
 Villa Farm.People work from April     
 until August.I asked a couple of      
 workers questions about their job.I   
 asked them,why they worked there,what 
 do you do?Is there something about the
 job you really enjoy doing?How many   
 years have you worked here?Do you like
 strawberries?Mrs.Bunting answered:-   
 I know the farmer and it is nice      
 seasonal work.I weigh and sell        
 strawberries.Meeting people who visit 
 the farm.14 years.Yes.Mrs.Seaber:-    
 Because it fits in with family life.  
 Pick strawberries.Being out in the    
 open air.8 years.Yes.                 </content>
