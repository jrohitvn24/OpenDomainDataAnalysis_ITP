		<content> At the moment there are 11 under five 
 year old children at the playgroup.   
 They do painting, drawing, glueing,   
 listen to music, play in the sand pit 
 and paddling pool, listen to stories  
 and learn rhymes. They do one outing  
 per term, sports day, picnics, or they
 go swimming. They do all sorts of     
 Christmas fairs, fetes and sponsored  
 events, and organise a fireworks party
 and summer fete for the village. They 
 raise funds by events and collecting  
 unwanted newspapers. The village      
 primary school was closed in 1983 and 
 the 25 children go by bus to          
 Barrington. Others go to Meldreth and 
 Cambridge. Secondary education is at  
 Melbourn Village College.
