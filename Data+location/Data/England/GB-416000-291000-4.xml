		<title>04SCENERY AROUND CURDWORTH</title>
		<content> THE UNDULATING LANDSCAPE AROUND THE   
 AREA CAN HAVE CHANGED LITTLE SINCE    
 ENCLOSURE UNTIL NOW. HEDGES HAVE GONE 
 GIVING A BARREN ASPECT TO THE OUTLYING
 FIELDS. THE RIVER TAME TO THE SOUTH   
 HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF WOODLAND ON ITS 
 BANK. A NARROW SPINNEY ALONG THE CANAL
 TO THE NORTH. THE EAST IS DOMINATED BY
 THE COOLING TOWERS AND PYLONS OF THE  
 POWER STATION AND NOW THE MOTORWAY.   
 SEWAGE WORKS TO THE WEST. CURDWORTH   
 VILLAGE LIES IN A HOLLOW, THE CHURCH  
 ON RISING GROUND EASILY SEEN. BECAUSE 
 OF THE ENVIRONMENT CURDWORTH AND WATER
 ORTON HAVE A LOT OF POLLUTION. THE    
 RIVER TAME IS NOW IMPROVED AND THE    
 FISH BACK. THE WASTE EMITTED FROM THE 
 POWER STATION IS LESS NOW, AND THE    
 WARM WATER FROM THE COOLING TOWERS HAS
 ATTRACTED MANY WATER BIRDS TO THE     
 NATURE RESERVE. THERE ARE FOOTPATHS   
 AND A VARIETY OF FLORA AND FAUNA.     </content>
