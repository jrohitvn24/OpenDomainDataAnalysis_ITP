 It has a big graveyard with trees     
 surrounding it.The tower is about 80  
 feet high.At the front of the choir   
 stalls there is an{eagle lectern.     
 There are 17th century{Jacobean box

 replaced with stone from Roche Abbey  
 which is a Benedictine Monastery in   
 ruins near Maltby.There is a sundial  
 hanging above the door.The church has 
 metal scaffolding round the tower     
 because it isn't safe.They are        
 replacing some stones with stone from
