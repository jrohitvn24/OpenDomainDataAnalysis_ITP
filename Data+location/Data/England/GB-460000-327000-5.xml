		<title>05Widmerpool Hall (1)</title>
		<content> The present hall has no direct conn-  
 ection with the ancient Saxon family  
 of Wimarspol or Wide mere Polle, but  
 was built in 1872-73 on a slight ridge
 as a private residence for the lord of
 the manor of Widmerpool estate, compr-
 ising about 890 hectares of land. The 
 previous hall was demolished in 1875. 
 The Hall is built in modern Gothic    
 style in the form of a parallelogram, 
 of Bath and Clipsham limestone, with  
 a lofty and handsome clock tower but  
 at present no clock. The grounds were 
 planted with a wide variety of trees  
 including the American Coast redwood, 
 yews and, in the nearby churchyard,   
 cedars of Lebanon (among Britain's    
 earliest). Parts of the grounds are   
 now used for private houses but many  
 trees remain. Wild birds find homes in
 the trees and underbrush and over 40  
 species of birds have been identified.</content>
