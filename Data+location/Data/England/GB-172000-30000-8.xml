		<title>08TREVONE QUARRY, TREVERVA</title>
		<content> Trevone Quarry is a working quarry.   
 There was a long dusty drive to the   
 quarry. On either side of the drive   
 there were blocks of granite that had 
 faults in them. These faults could not
 be seen before the stone was cut.The  
 faults were quite clear when it had   
 been cut.This granite could not be    
 used.                                 
   This quarry does not only process   
 British granite it also uses marble   
 and foreign granite.The granite is    
 used for architectural facings to     
 office blocks and shop fronts.        
    They send 90% of their produce to  
 the city of London and the remainder  
 goes to anywhere in the U.K.,but less 
 than 1% stays in the South West of    
 Britain.
