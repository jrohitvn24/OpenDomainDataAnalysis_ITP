		<content>    Life at the school is very active  
 and varied.The curriculum covers all  
 aspects and is skill based rather than
 on the aquisition of detailed facts.  
 In order to carry this out the local  
 environment is used alot and in the   
 school grounds an environmental       
 studies area has been developed by the
 children.In their third and fourth    
 years the children also stay at field 
 centres,Greatwood and Chaterhouse.    
 Each year a school play is put on.The 
 children are involved in writing the  
 script and in making the props.At     
 christmas the teachers put on a       
 lightheart production for the         
 children.                             
    There are also many clubs the      
 childedren can go to including        
 football,netball,recorders,choir,art, 
 cricket and country dancing.
