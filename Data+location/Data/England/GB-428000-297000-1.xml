		<title>01ATHERSTONE/MANCETTER HISTORY</title>
		<content>In ROMAN times,MANCETTER was a Roman   
military fort. There is argument that  
Boudiccan forces fought the Romans in  
the area in the last great battle.From 
AD100 to AD370 MANCETTER pottery became
a flourishing industry over a wide area
  In SAXON times MANCETTER became the  
centre of the parish, ATHERSTONE being 
part of it.                            
  ATHERSTONE, probably became a focus  
for travellers at the crossroads of the
Watling Street and the north-south     
route from Derby to Oxford. It was only
8 miles from Tamworth where the Saxon  
King of Mercia had his palace.         
  In NORMAN times there is an entry in 
the Domesday Book- "The Countess (Lady 
Godiva) herself held in Aderstone 3    
hides for 5 ploughs. 11 villagers, 2   
smallholders and 1 slave with 4 ploughs
Meadow 6 acres: Woodland 2 leagues long
and 2 leagues wide." Value 40s in 1066.</content>
