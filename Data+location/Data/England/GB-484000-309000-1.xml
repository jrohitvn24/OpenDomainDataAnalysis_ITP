		<content>       In 1974 Rutland finally lost the
 battle to retain its status as the    
 ssmallest county in England, however  
 there is still 'much in little'.      
       The history of the area is full 
 of links with Royalty as Rutland was  
 traditionally part of the dower of the
 queens of England. Edward the         
 Confessor bequeathed it to Queen Edith
 whose name survives to this day at    
 Edith Weston.                         
       In Rutland one finds many of the
 attractive features of the surrounding
 countryside which varies from the     
 broad valley of the River Welland to  
 the compact hills of eastern Leicester
 shire. In addition to the market towns
 of Oakham and Uppingham, each with its
 well_known independent school, there  
 are 50 villages scattered throughout  
 the unspoilt countryside.
