		<title>19DIDSBURY FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> An annual event held in Didsbury      
 Manchester is the Didsbury Festival. A
 procession of decorated floats and    
 local groups marches through the      
 village accompanied by a band of      
 musicians. The procession ends in a   
 local park where there are sideshows  
 and fun rides for everyone to enjoy.  
 The festival was started many years   
 ago and is connected with the old     
 'wakes weeks' holidays. About thirty  
 years ago the festival was known as   
 Didsbury Show and was a large local   
 agricultural show. It included show   
 jumping, dog classes, pet classes,    
 flower and vegetable classes, as well 
 as livestock classes. There were other
 attractions too including food and    
 drink and sideshows and exhibitions.  
 It was a major day out for many folk  
 in the Didsbury area and was held on  
 August Bank Holiday Monday.           </content>
