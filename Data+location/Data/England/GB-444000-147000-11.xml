		<content>   We have been thinking about how     
 children in Whitchurch spend their    
 day.Here is one example of how a ten  
 year old girl spends her day.         
   We all get up between seven o'clock 
 and half past seven.I race downstairs 
 to breakfast with my sister.When we   
 have finished our breakfast my best   
 friend comes to collect me for        
 school.We arrive at school at about a 
 quarter to nine,and go in at nine     
 o'clock.We do Maths,English,Science or
 Art.                                  
   When school is over I rush home and 
 normally collapse in front of the     
 television and watch some good        
 programmes,the one I like best at the 
 moment is called Cover Up.Tea is      
 usually about five thirty.Bed time is 
 nine o'clock                          
                                       
                                       </content>
