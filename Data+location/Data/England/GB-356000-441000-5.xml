		<content> Some annual customs concerned with    
 farming and the protection of         
 livestock revolve around the          
 extermination of vermin. In winter,   
 there is fox-hunting, on foot, with   
 guns and Jack Russell                 
 terriers;in spring, there is          
 crow-shooting whilst the corpses of   
 moles which have been trapped or      
 poisoned can be seen hanging on fences
 at any time of year.                  
                                       
   For hundreds of years, in times of  
 national importance, beacons have been
 lit on the top of Beacon Fell, so     
 giving the hill its name. A beacon was
 lit most recently in 1977 to celebrate
 the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth 
 II.It was one of a chain of beacons   
 which stretched the length and breadth
 of the country.
