		<title>07Plumtree,a working village.</title>
		<content> Although a small village,(population  
 approx. 200), Plumtree has retained   
 most of the traditional facilities and
 amenities of the English village. A   
 busy road running through the village 
 ensures a regular bus service and     
 provides customers for the post office
 village stores and pub. The Church has
 a healthy congregation and the Church 
 of England school, closed down by the 
 L.E.A. in 1974 is now a thriving,     
 independent primary school. The       
 railway line by the village is now    
 used by British Rail as a test track  
 and is maintained in good order.The   
 station is now a popular restaurant. A
 village cricket green, 3 working farms
 within the village boundary and a     
 well-used village hall complete the   
 traditional scene.
