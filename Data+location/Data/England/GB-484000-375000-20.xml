		<title>20Fenton Parish Council</title>
		<content> The Parish Council is served by six   
 members although seven are allowed.   
 If, when an election occurs, more than
 seven wish to stand, the cost of the  
 election is stood by the Parish       
 Council. Meetings are held once a     
 month and deal mainly with planning   
 applications and any complaints from  
 residents. Even though it is only a   
 small cog in a big wheel, Councillors 
 feel that providing they can put the  
 argument across well, notice will be  
 taken of it by the appropriate        
 authority. Some Councillors feel that 
 not enough residents take advantage of
 the Parish Council and that a few are 
 apathetic towards it. This is         
 reflected in the poor attendece of    
 villagers at the monthly meetings     
 which they can attend as spectators.
