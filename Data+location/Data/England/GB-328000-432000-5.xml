		<content> Blackpool owed its development from a 
 tiny fishing village at the beginning 
 of the 19th Century to a large seaside
 resort of approximately 150,000 people
 to the working classes of the         
 industdrial North and Midlands.       
 Brought by the cheap railways,        
 Blackpool provided a cheap holiday.   
 Today Blackpool still provides cheap  
 holidays, with a terrific variety of  
 things to do even if the weather is   
 inclement.  The famous Tower,         
 Illuminations and trams continue to   
 make it a unique resort and its season
 continues nearly two months after most
 other resorts have closed down for the
 winter.  It also continues to cater   
 for political and business conferences
 throughout the year.
