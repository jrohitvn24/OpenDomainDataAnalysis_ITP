		<content>{St. Paul's Parish Church}was built in 
 1846 expecting to be the centre of    
 future habitation from Denholme and   
 Denholme Clough. Still isolated, the  
 church has been divided and the       
 eastern end is used as a meeting room.
 Regular Sunday services are enhanced  
 by a peal of 8 bells.                 
 In l958, a building formerly used by  
 the Salvation Army and as a           
 greengrocery shop, became {St.Peter's 
{Roman Catholic Church}, and under the 
 auspices of Haworth Church, mass is   
 said each Sunday.                     
 In l972 the Independent chapel joined 
 with the Presbyterian church and      
 became the {Denholme United Reformed  
{Church. }They have a church (a listed 
 building) and a Sunday School.        
 The {Baptist}fraternity meet each     
 Sunday in a room at the Community     
 Centre.                               </content>
