		<title>02HOUSING IN FENCE AND HIGHAM</title>
		<content>  THE VILLAGES OF FENCE AND HIGHAM HAVE
 SEEN AN INTRESTING CHANGE IN THEIR    
 HOUSING STOCK OVER THE LAST 150 YEARS.
 ORIGINALLY THE VILLAGES WERE VERY     
 SMALL AND THE ONLY HOUSES WERE FARM-  
 HOUSES.A FEW OF THESE OLD FARMHOUSES  
 REMAIN.                               
  IN THE "INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION" YEARS 
 WHEN EACH VILLAGE ACQUIRED A MILL SOME
 ROWS OF TERRACED HOUSING WERE BUILT   
 (2 ROOMS UPSTAIRS,2 ROOMS DOWN STAIRS 
 AND TOILET OUTSIDE).                  
  THE VILLAGES HAVE GROWN OVER THE LAST
 20 YEARS AS COMMUTER VILLAGES FOR     
 WORKERS THROUGHOUT PENDLE.SUBSTANTIAL 
 SEMI-DETACHED,DETACHED AND BUNGALOWS  
 HAVE BEEN BUILT,EACH WITH ITS OWN     
 GARDEN FRONT AND BACK AND GARAGE.     
  THE VILLAGES DO NOT HAVE ANY HIGH    
 RISE FLATS OR MUCH COUNCIL HOUSING.   
                                       
                                       </content>
