		<content>  I like it where I live because it's  
 not very noisy and the people are     
 friendly.                             
  I like living here a lot because I am
 not far from a beach. The only thing  
 I don't like is that everybody comes  
 to this part of the country for their 
 holidays.                             
  I don't like living here because     
 there are no really exciting things   
 to do.                                
  I like to live in a small country    
 village as I was brought up in the    
 countryside and I don't like smoke and
 fumes and dark streets.               
  It's better in a village than a town 
 because there's more space to play in.
