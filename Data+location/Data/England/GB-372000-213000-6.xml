		<content> A large proportion of housewives has  
 access to a car and much shopping is  
 done in Gloucester,sometimes as bulk  
 purchases from the supermarkets with  
 storage in home freezers.Roadside     
 stalls sell fruit and vegetables in   
 season and pick-your-own fruit farms  
 supply what the local gardens and     
 orchards haven't produced.A small post
 office/general grocery serves the area
 along with a family-owned small       
 abbatoir/butchery business and a      
 nearby public house.For other         
 requirements people travel to         
 neighbouring villages or small towns  
 and to public houses along the side   
 roads.Several people keep hens or     
 ducks as a money-spinner,for          
 household needs or for                
 pleasure.Goats,horses,ponies,cats and 
 dogs also form part of the home       
 background.                           </content>
