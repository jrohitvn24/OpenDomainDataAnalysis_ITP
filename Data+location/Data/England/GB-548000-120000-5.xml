		<content>   In the northeastern part of Uckfield
 land previously forming a part of     
 Hempstead Farm Stud is soon to be     
 developed as a housing estate         
 comprising 400 2,3,&amp; 4 bedroomed      
 houses.As this new development will   
 practically join the already existing 
 Manor Park estate,as well as using    
 their access road ,many of the local  
 residents we spoke to were against    
 this new development.                 
   A number of the older people were   
 saddened by the fact that they would  
 no longer  be surrounded by farm and  
 woodland.Many parents living on Manor 
 Park estate were concerned about the  
 increase in traffic the new estate    
 would bring to the one existing access
 road.                                 
   In general most of the people we    
 spoke to felt Uckfield was big enough.
