		<title>10 A Shoe Factory</title>
		<content>  We visited a typical Rushden shoe    
factory It was larger than most in the 
area, well-established, designing and  
making its own shoes. These shoes are  
sold in Britain and all over the world.
  Over 200 processes go into the making
of one shoe. The factory was very noisy
and some of the machines looked very   
dangerous. Leather they use comes from 
cows,snakes,ostriches,young goats,     
calves and rhino's.                    
  We found that 80% of the workers came
from Rushden. Some came on the firm's  
bus from Irchester, others came from   
Kettering, Northampton and Wellingb'gh.
  We surveyed factories in the area, as
many have closed during the last few   
years. Greater competition with foreign
imports has caused this. We found 14   
factories in our block; 10 still made  
shoes, 2 had changed products, 2 had   
closed completely.                     </content>
