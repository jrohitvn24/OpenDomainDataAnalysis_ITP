		<title>14SCHOOLS IN RUDDINGTON</title>
		<content> In the 17th.Century {James Peacock}   
 said he would pay for a teacher and a 
 schoolroom.This was the start of {    
{Ruddington Endowed Boys School.}In    
 1875 a new building was built in      
 memory of {Sir Charles Paget}and his  
 wife. The church school was founded in
 1852 by {Sir Thomas Parkyn }and was in
 the building opposite the church. A   
 lot of children attended these schools
 but some were very poor and could not 
 afford the penny per day and they were
 part-timers as they worked on the     
 farms or in the Knitting Shops.       
 When free schooling started the same  
 buildings were used until the {James  
{Peacock Infant School}was built in    
 1969 and then in 1972 the{Juniors     
 moved to our present building on      
{Ashworth Avenue.}It has open plan     
 classrooms with carpet areas and a    
 large hall and playing field.         </content>
