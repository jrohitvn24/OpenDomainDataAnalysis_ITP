 In a morning 4 buses come to the      
 village to take the older children (ll
 to l8) to the big school in Barton.   
 The buses leave the village at half   
 past eight. One stops at the          
 Brocklesby Ox, one stops at the end of
 Coronaton Road, one stops at Walker's 
 Way and one goes to Ulceby Skitter.   
 Before Baysgarth school was built at  
 Barton the secondary children went to 
 Immingham Secondary Modern School but 
 some went to Barton Grammar School.   
 You had to take the eleven-plus to go 
 there. Now everybody goes to Baysgarth
 Comprehensive School. Some of the old 
 people of the village only went to our
 village school and then they went to  
 work when they were l4. The only bit  
 of our old school that is left is the 
 school bell, the rest was knocked down
 after the new school was built.       </content>
