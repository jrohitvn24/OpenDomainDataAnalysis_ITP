		<content> Mrs Fearn told us she used to go to   
 the old  school in Fritchley. There   
 was no hot water, and there wasn't a  
 canteen. She started school when she  
 was 5 and left when she was 14. when  
 she did cooking she had to walk to    
 the Parish rooms at Crich. Mr Jackson 
 told us there were 3 shops in         
 Fritchley, but now there is only 1,   
 which is Richardsons. The house next  
 door to Richardsons shop used to be a 
 butchers shop, and the house next to  
 the Red Lion Inn used to be a Grocery 
 store. There are more people in the   
 village now than when these Ladies    
 were little. For instance, Dale Close 
 used to be a field, but now it is a   
 large area.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
