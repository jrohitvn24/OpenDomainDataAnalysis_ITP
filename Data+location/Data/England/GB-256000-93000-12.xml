		<title>12TRAFFIC CONGESTION/BY-PASS</title>
		<content> Okehampton stands on the A30 trunk    
 road, direct route to Cornwall from   
 the rest of the U.K. For much, apart  
 from the heavy lorries, traffic flows 
 through without notice. Summer week   
 -end traffic congestion brings the    
 A30 to a standstill. Holiday makers,  
 locally known as 'grockles', often sit
 and wait for the privilege of passing 
 through the town. Sometimes the queues
 are up to seven miles long (picture). 
 A by-pass was first suggested in the  
 1920's. After a number of public      
 inquiries and much local debate Oke.  
 still has no by-pass. Two routes have 
 been suggested, one to the north of   
 the town through farmland, and one to 
 the south across the edge of the      
 National Park. The latter requires an 
 act of parliament and has upset many  
 conservationist. Most towns people    
 just want a by-pass.                  </content>
