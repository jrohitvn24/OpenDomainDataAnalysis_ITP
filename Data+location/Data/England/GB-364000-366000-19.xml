		<title>19        Meadowbank</title>
		<content>    Meadowbank is a small village with 
 one corner shop, one garage and no    
 school as it has closed down.         
    It has a beef farm just down the   
 road opposite the salt mine.          
    Just down the road, the other      
 way from the village are two bridges, 
 one leading on to an island and one   
 leading to the otherside of the river.
 Quite a few people come to this       
 stretch of the river, apart from there
 being private caravans on the hill    
 behind the river, it is a pretty      
 place, good for picnics and fishing.  
 This little island is virtually in    
 Meadowbank.                           
    Meadowbank is five minutes in      
 the car from the shopping centre.
