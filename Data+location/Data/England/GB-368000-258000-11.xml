		<content> At partly moated Woodmanton Farm      
 there are the remains of a former     
 Chapel now a farm building. The Chapel
 had an impressive roof, it was a      
 timber wagon vault, and can be        
 connected with a date of 1332,when a  
 licence to crennallate was granted.   
 The Chapel also has a timber window of
 two lights with ogee-trefoiled heads. 
 The ground floor at some time was     
 converted into the farm kitchen,with a
 chimneystack built right up through   
 the upper part of the Chapel. The     
 first floor is a seventeenth century  
 insertion. The roof is more or less   
 complete over two bays and is a wagon 
 vault. It is an example of a rafter   
 roof with curved ashlar pieces,       
 originally supported by a timber      
 substructure.
