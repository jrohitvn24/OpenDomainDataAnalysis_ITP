 Some people do not go on holidays     
 because they are working on farms and 
 have  to look  after animals. This    
 means that some children just go away 
 for days.                             
    Places in England visited by       
 children in the school include        
 Windermere and the Lake               
 District,London,Chichester,Preston,Bla
 ckpool and Stafford.Sometimes these   
 holidays were with relations.Places   
 visited in Scotland are               
 Edinburgh,Inverness, Loch Ness, Isle  
 of Arran, Aviemore and Glasgow.       
    Places abroad visited include      
 Malta, Spain and Italy.               
    One family own a caravan and go    
 touring every year.
