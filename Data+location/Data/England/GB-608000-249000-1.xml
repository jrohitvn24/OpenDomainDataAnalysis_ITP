		<content> The land rises sharply from Gipping   
 Valley in east, falling to south,     
 giving wide views eastwards. Soil     
 mostly clay with sandy outcrops much  
 used by Badgers.                      
 Farms predominantly arable with some  
 pasture, much the largest being       
 Blakenham Farms (noted garden at      
 Cottage Farm). Many hedges gone, but  
 much tree planting evident, especially
 on Blakenham Farms.                   
 Ditch Wood part of mediaeval Barking  
 Woods, small moated Tarston Hall      
 alongside. Larger noteworthy houses,  
 Nettlestead High Hall, Baylham Hall   
 (both red brick Elizabethan) and      
 Nettlestead chace (early 19th century)
 with decaying archway remmnant of     
 original tudor house. Several isolated
 farmhouses and other listed buidings. 
 Population sparse, except in GT       
 Blakenham which has the only shop     </content>
