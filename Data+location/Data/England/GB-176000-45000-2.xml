		<title>02RURAL CORNWALL WEST OF TRURO</title>
		<content>                                       
      Truro is the administrative      
 capital of Cornwall, and is bounded by
 open countryside. The area which we   
 surveyed was a rural area, to the west
 of Truro. We have commented in our    
 survey on; Farming, Health, Housing,  
 Landscape, Local History, Religion,   
 Transport, and Ecology.               
      Part of a housing estate near    
 Threemilestone, the main non-casualty 
 hospital for Cornwall (Treliske       
 Hospital), and a few modern light     
 industrial estates, are the main      
 buildings that fall into our area.    
 Other than the buildings, the area is 
 generally covered in grass and        
 scattered farmers' crops.             
      The farms themselves are small,  
 situated around the hilly countryside.
 Most of the roads in the area are     
 minor roads.                          </content>
