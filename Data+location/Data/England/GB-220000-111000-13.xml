		<content> Cycling is popular but there is little
 public transport  so children's       
 mobility is limited until they are old
 enough  to drive  and can  acquire the
 use of a motorbike or car.  When it is
 fine they enjoy going to the beach for
 a variety of activities;swimming,beach
 games, sunbathing, barbecues etc.     
 football, cricket and riding are also 
 popular. Many wish that there was a   
 nearer indoor swimming pool.One keen  
 young family  of  swimmers travels  to
 Barnstaple several times a week for   
 training. There are no regular        
 organised activities for teenagers at 
 present, but following the opening of 
 the Community Centre it is planned    
 to start a Youth Club for the 10-15   
 age group. This is planned to offer   
 football, net ball, snooker etc.  And 
 later, perhaps discos which are also  
 popular.                              </content>
