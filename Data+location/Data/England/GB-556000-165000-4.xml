		<content>A lonely and unfrequented place this   
parish was said to be in ancient times 
containing l000 acres of land on high  
ground the soil inclined to chalkey and
very flinty and so barren. Thus the    
historian Hasted describes it. Here has
stood a lovely Norman church serene in 
its quiet beauty for 800 years and in  
the opposite corner a Saxon burial     
ground near the Horton Kirby border.   
The family of de Faukehams came over   
with the Conqueror and adopted the     
parish name and lived here 800 years   
until l949.Previous families owning    
much of the land in old Fadkham were   
the Malemanynes,Grandisons, Bryans,    
Poynings, Dyggis,BNotelers and until   
l830 Bouverie Pusey family but the     
moeity of the advowson was retained    
by this family until l929,although on  
Philip Bouverie Pusey's death most of  
the land was sold.                     </content>
