		<content>   Hersden was built as homes for the  
 miners of Chislet Colliery. The mine  
 was closed in 1969 so now miners who  
 live in the village travel to other   
 pits in the Kent coal field and there 
 are many families who have no         
 connection with mining. The site of   
 Chislet Colliery is being developed as
 an industrial park.  The Miners       
 Welfare is still in the village and   
 was busy during the miners strike of  
 1984-85 serving meals to children and 
 distributing food gifts.  There is a  
 modern primary school with 120 pupils 
  The doctor's surgery has a dispensary
 as there is no chemists shop nearer   
 than Sturry.  There are 2 churches;   
 one Roman Catholic and one Methodist. 
 The Methodist Church is used jointly  
 by Methodists and Anglicans as part of
 an ecumenical group which also        
 includes Sturry and Westbere.         </content>
