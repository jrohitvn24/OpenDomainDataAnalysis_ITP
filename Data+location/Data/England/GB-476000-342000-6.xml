		<content> poorly attended but the main festivals
 are well supported.The care of souls  
 is under 3 separate parsons.As with   
 education each village although close 
 in proximity has 3 religious          
 administration areas.Alverton and     
 Flawborough are in the Newark deanery 
 of the Southwall diocese and serve by 
 a retired clergyman who travels in the
 area to administer clerical duties.   
 Shelton is in the same deanery but    
 served by a team ministry from Newark.
 Thoroton is in the Cranmer group of   
 parishes and is served by a clergyman 
 who lives outside the area.The        
 villages are served by non-resident   
 clergy all acting in joint parishes,  
 the social contact with the vicar     
 intermittant,and sunday schools etc.  
 The ties between villagers and their  
 local church are being eroded.
