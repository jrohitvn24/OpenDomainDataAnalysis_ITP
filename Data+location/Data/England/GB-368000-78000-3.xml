		<content>{ St.John's Church}with it's towering  
 spire reaching 150 ft.into the sky    
 dominates the northern end of Weymouth
 Esplanade.                            
  Begun in 1850,it was completed four  
 years later.The building was designed 
 by Thomas Talbot Bury,a pupil of      
 Augustin Pugin,in the style of the    
 14th century.                         
  The stone used in the building is    
 Bincombe stone,although Bath and Caen 
 stone were used for detailing.        
  The tower has two bells,no longer in 
 use,and a clock,which was renovated   
 and returned to working order in 1985.
  A visitor to the church will enjoy   
 the quiet of the interior and be able 
 to see the beauty of the stained glass
 windows.                              
  On Sundays the church has a          
 congregation of 200-250 people meeting
 to worship God.                       </content>
