		<title>13    THE REDGRAVE THEATRE</title>
		<content> In January,1985,the whole school      
 walked down to the Redgrave Theatre   
 for a special performance of "The Owl 
 and The Pussy Cat". This was to       
 celebrate both our school's and the   
 theatre's Tenth Birthday.             
  We have many connections with our    
 local theatre; some of us belong to   
 the Junior Theatre Club.We have had   
 several chances to take part in       
 productions where children are        
 needed,such as "Calvacade". The 4th   
 year have been shown many of the      
 behind scenes aspects of the          
 theatre.There is a touring group      
 "Theatreaction",who visit schools with
 suitable plays.We have enjoyed these  
 at our school.The stage manager,set   
 designer and wardobe mistress came to 
 give us some very interesting talks in
 assembly.The Theatre is named after   
 Sir Michael Redgrave.                 </content>
