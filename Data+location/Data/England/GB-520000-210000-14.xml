		<title>14HOME LIFE in Welwyn G.C.</title>
		<content> The{life style}for many households is 
 dependant upon the requirements of the
 adults' employment.Children of school 
 age often take their main meal in the 
 evening when the adults eat. A simple 
 survey of 20 families showed 50% with 
 2 or more{wage-earners.}              
 Just over half had lived in the same  
 house for over 5 years. Nearly all    
{heating is by gas}but 75%{cook  by}   
{electricity.}Many claim to use few    
 convenience foods but a few use them  
 frequently. About half grow some of   
 their own food. 75% shop in the town  
 centre, just a few shop out of town.  
 Among the younger population there is 
 an interest in physical recreation but
 much time is spent watching t/v.      
 More than 75% keep{pets,}with cats    
 outnumbering the dogs.
