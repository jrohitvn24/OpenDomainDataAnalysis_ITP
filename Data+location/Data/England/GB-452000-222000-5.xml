		<title>05 EXCAVATION 1970-82</title>
		<content>     Between 1970 and 1982 the site of 
the  castle earthworks beside the      
church were excavated by the           
Extra-Mural  studies department Oxford 
University.                            
     The dig produced evidence of      
settlement in the area.The evidence    
suggested the earliest settlement was  
late Iron Age.This was followed by     
Roman settlement which had been        
previously unsuspected.                
     A large Anglo-Saxon settlement    
succeeded this and the Domesday entry  
suggests that Middleton Stoney was     
fairly important at the time.          
     The castle has been dated about   
the 12'th century or early 13'th and   
was destroyed about the year 1216 .The 
dig has suggested that the village is a
good example of life in the Medieval   
period.The evidence is stored in the   
library at Woodstock.                  </content>
