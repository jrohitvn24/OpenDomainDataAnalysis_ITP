 CONSIDERABLY FROM CHILDREN TO         
 CHILDREN.SOME PREFER TO SPEND A LOT OF
 THEIR TIME IN BED BUT MOST PREFER TO  
 GO OUT TO PLAY WITH THEIR FRIENDS OR  
 RELATIVES.SOME CHILDREN GO TO THE     
 SWIMMING POOL OR TO THE PARK TO PLAY  
 FOOTBALL OR OTHER SORTS OF GAMES. A   
 FEW MIGHT EVEN GO OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
 TO GO HORSE RIDING OR JUST WALKING.   
 ON SUNDAYS MOST PEOPLE DO OUTDOOR     
 THINGS BECAUSE THE INDOOR AMUSEMENTS  
 ARE NOT OPEN.SUNDAY SHOULD BE A       
 QUIETER DAY,PERHAPS, BUT GENERALLY IT 
 IS VERY NOISY.YOUNGER CHILDREN RUN    
 AROUND PLAYING COWBOYS AND INDIANS OR 
 HIDE AND SEEK. OTHERS JUST RIDE THEIR 
 BIKES ON THE PAVEMENTS. SOME CHILDREN 
 DO HELP THEIR PARENTS ON A SUNDAY IN  
 THE HOUSE OR GARDEN.
