		<content> IN 1981{MARJORIE GRANT}opened a dress 
 shop in the lodge house at Mowden Hall
 school.She opens 5 days a week-Tuesday
 to Saturday-and also takes clothes out
 to clients at home.This may be because
 they are elderly or handicapped       
 although visiting the shop is easy as 
 cars can park right at her door and   
 everything is on the level.Many busy  
 farmers wives come twice a year to    
 stock up with clothes for the season  
 ahead,sizes range from 10-26 and      
 alterations can be done if neccessary.
 Another advantage of the shop is the  
 fact that hats,handbags and other     
 accessories are also sold so that     
 matching up can be done without       
 trudging from shop to shop,especially 
 useful in the case of wedding outfits.
