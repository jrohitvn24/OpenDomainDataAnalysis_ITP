		<title>18FARMING Mr.N.JENNINGS</title>
		<content>{MR.JENNINGS}owns Lane Ends Farm.He    
 started working as a farmer in 1941   
 on the family farm.He told us what    
 farming was like when he was a young  
 man.There was no machinery at all and 
 everything had to be done by hand.The 
 milk from the cows was taken by wagon 
 in churns to Kildwick Railway Station.
 Horses were used until the Second     
 World War and then tractors came in.  
 Mr Jennings has all modern machinery  
 now,but still milks the cows at 6-30  
 in the morning and 4-30 p.m.As many as
 90 cows can be milked,16 at a time.   
 There are 110 sheep on the farm and   
 each year they can have over 200      
 lambs.There are also 758 hens,and a   
 sheep-dog and lots of cats.Mr.Jennings
 has six farms altogether,and his two  
 sons do most of the work nowadays.Mr. 
 Jennings says he likes cows best of   
 all,but he sometimes has a pet lamb.  </content>
