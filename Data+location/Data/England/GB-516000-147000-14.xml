		<title>14VANDALISM IN NORTH HOLMWOOD</title>
		<content> Crime watch by some junior children.  
      We saw a Duck lying dead in a    
 pond with a blood stained rock nearby.
 It had been beaten to death,it was    
 horrible.                             
      The subway under the A24 road is 
 always being covered in graffiti some 
 of it is funny but mostly it is rude. 
      Our school has been vandalised   
 many times recently. Our swimming pool
 was wrecked. Bricks were thrown in the
 water and chemicals that keep the pool
 clean were thrown about. The          
 polystyrene covers were taken off and 
 the pool lost its heat. We could not  
 go swimming for several days.         
      A burning mat was placed outside 
 the First School one evening in an    
 attempt to burn it down.              
      Dogs and even humans have been   
 fouling in the porches and play areas 
 of the school.                        </content>
