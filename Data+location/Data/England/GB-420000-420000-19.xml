		<title>19DEWSBURY MOOR BRANCH LIBRARY</title>
		<content> We are five pupils from St.John's     
 Infant's School, Dewsbury Moor who    
 decided to investigate the{local      
{branch library.}We found out that the 
 building was officially opened on 5   
 May, 1956 at a cost of Â£6,504.        
 There are{16,000 books,}most of which 
 are{fiction.}There is also a small    
 non-fiction section which includes,   
 amongst other things, books on travel,
 sport, technology, the arts and       
 nature. Several local street maps and 
 directories are also kept for         
{reference}purposes.                   
 At present there are 2,360 tickets in 
 use with approximately{500 borrowers}a
 week. Around fifteen new members join 
 each week. The library is not         
 computerised. It is open every        
 afternoon except Tuesdays and Sundays.
