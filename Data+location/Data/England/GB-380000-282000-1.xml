		<content>Kinver or Kinfare was mentioned in Dom-
esday as Chenevare which in its Latin- 
ized form is Kuen-Vaur(high mountain)  
or in Saxon Cyne-Fare(royal road).There
is evidence of a Saxon camp(flint axe- 
heads have been found)on Kinver Edge   
although the site has not yet been     
excavated.At that time the population  
was 27 heads of families,today it is   
over 7000.Originally people from the   
Black Country came here as tourists    
but in the past 50 years have come to  
settle here.Both private &amp; council ho- 
uses have developed alongside.The gre- 
en belt still restricts development.   
The only public transport to the vil-  
lage is hourly by bus.The county town  
of Stafford is 26 miles away.

orical Society from village chemist &amp;  
National Trust on Kinver Edge.
