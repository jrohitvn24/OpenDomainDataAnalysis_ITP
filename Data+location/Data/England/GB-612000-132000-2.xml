		<content>{My dad, Christopher.}He is a tubby    
 man. He likes going to sleep after his
 lunch or dinner. He's a photographer  
 and he enjoys it very much. When we   
 have visitors they ask my dad to do   
 his gorilla. He puts his knuckles on  
 the ground and just drags his whole   
 body along over the floor. His        
 favourite food is Chinese. And he     
 loves tractors.{My mum, Beryl.}She is 
 very fussy and tidy; she hates messy  
 houses. She likes to spin she goes to 
 many guild meetings and is popular    
 with her jumpers. Also she likes dress
 making. Nearly all her clothes are    
 made by her. When she was young she   
 used to do hair dressing.{Me, Hayley}I
 like to cook, skate, draw and I like  
 shoes. People say I am very much like 
 my Dad; hardly any lip, chubby and    
 no-one takes me seriously.
