		<title>18FOOT_PATHS _ CLEE HILL AREA</title>
		<content>     There are many foot_paths in the  
 area. Most of them are near the       
 villages of{Clee Hill}and{Hope Bagot. 
 Some of them go across the common,    
 while others go through woodlands,    
 such as{Gorstley Rough}and{The Novers.
 Recently some of them have been marked
 with yellow arrows and sign posts, and
 stiles have been renewed. To keep them
 open, these paths have to be walked   
 once a year, but after 5 years, if no 
 one has walked them, they can be      
 closed. If a foot_path crosses your   
 land, you are to make sure it is kept 
 clear. Walkers are not supposed to    
 wander off from the path. There are   
 also bridle paths along which you can 
 ride horses.                          
     In summer it is pleasant to go for
 walks, but in the winter, the paths   
 are covered in leaves and branches,   
 and it is usually muddy.              </content>
