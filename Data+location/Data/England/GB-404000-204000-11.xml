		<content> The houses are all built of the local 
 limestone which is a creamy colour    
 when new and weathers to a greyer     
 shade. Most of the roofs are also     
 stone tiled. Garden walls are built of
 the same stone.                       
    Some of the houses are very old,   
 but styles have not changed very much 
 so it is difficult to tell. According 
 to David Verey's book 'Gloucestershire
 :the Cotswolds'in the buildings of    
 England series published in 1970,     
 about half the cottages are 17th      
 century, the other half are 19th      
 century. Some have inscribed stones,eg
 'JM 1817' and' Sir J.M.Bart. 1841. The
 oldest one we found had the date 1698 
 on it. Most of the older houses have  
 been modernised and are very nice to  
 look at. The new houses are built in  
 the same style so nothing looks odd or
 out of place.              ( Cont.)   </content>
