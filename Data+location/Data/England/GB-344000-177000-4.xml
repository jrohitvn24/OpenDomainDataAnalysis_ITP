		<title>04THE RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> I interviewed a man who lived by the  
 pier.He said that the pier was once a 
 wooden one and that it once belonged  
 to the{Great Western Railway.}It now  
 belongs to the port of Bristol.Before 
 the power station was built a flour   
 mill was on the site.The pier-masters 
 house used to be a railway station.   
 The power station is due to be knocked
 down.The man showed us where the      
 stop-blocks were at the end of the    
 line.                                 
  He thought that the land left by the 
 power station may be used for housing.
