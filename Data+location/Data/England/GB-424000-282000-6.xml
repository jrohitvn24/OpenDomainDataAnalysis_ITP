		<content> Meriden has not escaped in 1985 from  
 the national problem of unemployment, 
 but in this largely rural, green belt 
 area, the problem is not as severe as 
 in the urban areas nearby.            
                                       
 The unemployment rate in this area is 
 9.2%, which compares with a national  
 rate of 13.5%.                        
                                       
 Employment falls into two categories, 
 those who work on the land, in local  
 industries or in local services, and  
 those who commute to work in the large
 urban areas nearby. The division      
 between the two is roughly half and   
 half of the local population.
