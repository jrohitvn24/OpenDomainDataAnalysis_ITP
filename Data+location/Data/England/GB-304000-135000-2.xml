		<title>02The Notley Arms</title>
		<content>     The Notley Arms has been in the   
 village of Monksilver for about one   
 hundred years.   Prior to the Notley  
 Arms the village of Monksilver had an 
 Inn called the Half Moon.   This can  
 still be seen opposite the Notley Arms
 and is called the{"Half Moon Cottage".
     The{stables}originally belonged to
 the Half Moon Inn as it was a{Coaching
{Inn.  }They now belong to the Notley  
 Arms and have the function of being a 
 cellar and{Skittle Alley.  }The       
 stables are in fact older than the    
 Notley  Inn.
