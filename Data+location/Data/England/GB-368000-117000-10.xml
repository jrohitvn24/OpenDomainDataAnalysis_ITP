		<content>{Henstridge Village School} is a       
 voluntary aided school which has      
 around 60 pupils,but the numbers on   
 the roll are falling.This is a trend  
 in many of the local village schools. 
 As a result a {Small Schools          
{Association}has been formed,it is made
 up of four small schools and the aim  
 is to widen the social experience of  
 the pupils.                           
 There has been a reaction against the 
 closure of small schools such as{     
{Henstridge School}as many villagers   
 see such closures as the start of the 
 decline of a village.
