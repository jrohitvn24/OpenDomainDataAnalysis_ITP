		<content> Although predominantly a farming      
 region less people are now employed on
 the land due to mechanisation. Most   
 people are employed in a variety of   
 jobs ranging from manual workers to a 
 high percentage of business /         
 professional people.                  
 Those working in the villages are     
 self_employed _ farmers, tradespeople 
 or those running small businesses,    
 others are domestic or farm workers.  
 A large number are employed in nearby 
 towns, the new city of Milton Keynes  
 has attracted many families to the    
 area. Good rail links to London enable
 residents to commute while others     
 drive 50 miles or more round the      
 country; 3 young men are in the       
 services. A sign of the times are the 
 working wives and mothers (a day      
 nursery has started at Grove Farm) and
 sadly some residents are unemployed.  </content>
