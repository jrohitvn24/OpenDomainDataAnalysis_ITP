		<content>{  Snibston}is a hamlet consisting of  
 four houses, a farm with a moated     
 house, a church and a school built in 
 1906 as a{County School}catering for  
 eighty pupils between the ages of five
 and fourteen. The church of{St.Mary's 
 built in the twelfth century was      
 originally tied to the parish of      
 Packington, but in 1910 was separated.
 In the last fifteen years several     
 farms have disappeared and their      
 buildings have been demolished for    
 either open cast workings or for the  
 area to be used as a waste dump for   
 the now closed{Snibstone Mine.        
 The name{Snibston}derives from the    
 snipe which used to nest near the     
 stream at the foot of Standard Hill,  
 so named because an unknown standard  
 was raised on the site at the time of 
 the{Battle of Bosworth, 1485.}Soldiers
 bodies were found in the churchyard.  </content>
