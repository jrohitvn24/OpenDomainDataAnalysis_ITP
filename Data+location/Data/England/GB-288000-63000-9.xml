		<content> We have a brand new school in Shiphay.
 Our school lasts from 8.50am to 3.50pm
 each day from Monday to Friday. Our   
 lessons are all 35 minutes each       
 (unless they are a double.) Lessons   
 include History, Geography, Maths,    
 English, French, Biology, Chemistry,  
 CDT, RE, Computing, Physics, Music,   
 Art, PE and Games. We get short breaks
 in the morning and afternoon and 90   
 minutes for dinner. At break we go out
 and play things like football and     
 cricket or we just mess about. We can 
 also go to the library. Prefects make 
 sure that we stay outside. If we are  
 rude to them they give us school rules
 to copy out. The school canteen does  
 good chips, sausages and burgers. we  
 get 3 homeworks a night (30 minutes   
 each!!) All in all school is OK.
