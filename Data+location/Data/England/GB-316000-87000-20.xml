		<title>20MY DADS LIFE IN BRANSCOMBE.</title>
		<content> My Dad has lived in Branscombe for 38 
 years. He used to come to Branscombe  
 school, it took him a quarter of an   
 hour to get to school because he used 
 to fetch his friend who lived down in 
 the square. When he came to school    
 they did not have heaters instead they
 had a fire. He used to live at Gays   
 Farm which is three quarters of a mile
 away from the school.When he was young
 they did not have water at the school 
 instead they used to have milk though 
 they used the pump to wash out the    
 milk bottles, the cloak room used to  
 be in where the sink is.Where he lives
 now he has not got mains water.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
