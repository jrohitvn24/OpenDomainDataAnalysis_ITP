		<content> The Swattenden Centre has been in     
 operation since 1976. Its main        
 function is to provide for the schools
 of Kent an educational resource base  
 which can be used for short-stay      
 educational visits.  Housed in a large
 masion house and adjacent dormitory   
 the Centre can cater for sixty-seven  
 visitors. The mid  Victorian mansion  
 dating from 1860 dominates the 27 acre
 estate which has some fine oak trees  
 planted as the house was constructed. 
 The grounds include playing fields    
 which double as camping areas.        
 Students visiting Swattenden carry    
 out environmental studies based in    
 and around the Wealden village of     
 Cranbrook, farm visits and outdoor    
 activities at Bewl Bridge and         
 Harrison Rocks. The Kent Education    
 Committee actively support our aims.
