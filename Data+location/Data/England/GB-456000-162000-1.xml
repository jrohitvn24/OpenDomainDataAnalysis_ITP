		<title>01OVERVIEW  OF THE TADLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The area surveyed by Brimpton Women's 
 Institute is on the Hampshire and     
 Berkshire border, within the Reading -
 Newbury - Basingstoke triangle.       
 Although not an area of particular    
 beauty this is a pleasant, mainly     
 rural area, but it includes the Atomic
 Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) 
 at Aldermaston and part of the urban  
 area which has grown to house and     
 provide services for the people there.
 This is the heart of "Nuclear Valley" 
 since in addition to the AWRE,        
 Greenham Common Airbase with its      
 Cruise Missiles lies three miles to   
 the west while the Royal Ordnance     
 Factory at Burghfield is some five    
 miles to the east. The area is in the 
 forefront of the nuclear debate, but  
 to the local inhabitants this is an   
 attractive, comfortable and peaceful  
 place in which to live in 1985.       </content>
