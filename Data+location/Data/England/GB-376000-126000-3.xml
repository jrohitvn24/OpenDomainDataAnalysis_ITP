		<content>    In our area we communicate mainly  
 by word of mouth and by postal        
 services. Telephones help people to   
 keep in touch with each other. In our 
 area mail is delivered by the postman 
 in his van or on his bicycle. There is
 a newspaper delivery boy.             
    Most people find out their news by 
 telephone. In Milton there is a       
 telephone at the Forge Garage. Some   
 people get local news from the village
 shop, or by reading the Western       
 Gazette or the Blackmore Vale         
 magazine. Many people have bicycles to
 ride around on and most people have   
 cars to get about in.                 
    There is no regular bus service,   
 but some take children to and from    
 school.                               
    "Team Contact"is the local parish  
 magazine and is delivered to the door.
