		<title>11TREE SURVEY.</title>
		<content> Whilst walking around the area we did 
 a tree count. We found trees along    
 avenues and roadsides as well as in   
 the fields. In one road e.g. in       
 Brookfield road,  about 125 trees were
 counted.                              
     In Warrington road,Twyford lane   
 and Mill lane we counted 43 trees in  
 total.                                
     Near Brook-House farm,  7 trees   
 were counted. At Finches Plantation   
 there were 40 trees and at the        
 Smallpox hospital, now demolished, we 
 counted 12 trees. We also found 8     
 trees along Whittle Brook.            
     Although not all the trees could  
 be identified, we did however         
 recognise some Oak,Alder and Chestnut 
 trees.                                
 Most of the trees near the houses were
 artificially planted. Very few of the 
 "natural" trees were immature.        </content>
