		<title>16OPPOSITION,BEWICK TRUST PLAN</title>
		<content> Opposition from many Mickley residents
 who are strongly in favour of the     
 restoration of the Birthplace but     
 without further enlargement.          
 First planning application rejected.It
 had included provision for a car and  
 coach park necessitating use of a road
 in Mickley considered unsuitable.It is
 too narrow for coaches to pass each   
 other. Also, leading from the A69, it 
 is a no-through road thus doubling the
 volume of traffic. In this application
 the Trust had sought facilities for an
 estimated 11000 visitors each year.   
 Third planning application successful.
 Regarded by many as watered down      
 version of the first.                 
 Residents still fear that the first   
 application is the scheme which the   
 Trust finally hopes to secure. {
