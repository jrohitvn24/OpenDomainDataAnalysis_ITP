		<title>14CLUBS SWIMMING FOOTBALL</title>
		<content> I (Scott) train six times a week with 
 five coaches who make me improve my   
{swimming}for competitions. I have 20  
 gold medals, 10 silver and 8 bronze,  
 as well as 6 trophies. In my swimming 
 club we can buy different sorts of    
 equipment such as track suits,        
 swimming trunks, bags, hats, jumpers  
 and T-shirts. I practise butterfly,   
 backstroke, free style and breast-    
 stroke. My favourite stroke is the    
 butterfly. The club I belong to is    
 called the Otters.                    
 We (Tim and Simon) both play for      
{football}teams. Tim plays for the     
 school as centre back and Simon for   
 Bearwood as goalie. Tim practises on  
 Mondays after school. The school team 
 has played against three other        
 schools. They won two and lost one.   
 Simon's team were runners up in two   
 leagues and winners of a third.       </content>
