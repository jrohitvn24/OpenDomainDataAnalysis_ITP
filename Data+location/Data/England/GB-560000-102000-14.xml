		<content> On Wednesdays and Fridays I go to     
 karate.It is held at the Hampden      
 Park sports centre.It costs two       
 pounds a week.For the first half      
 hour we do excercises and then an     
 hours karate training and there       
 is an extra half an hour for the      
 people who are more advanced.I go     
 with my friend in his dad's car.      
 There are about thirty one people     
 doing karate with me.

 Every week I go to a church youth     
 club,it costs 20p to get in and 50p   
 to be a member.Inside the youth club  
 there is a snooker table,table tennis 
 and a dart board.There is a canteen   
 for refreshments. Sometimes they take 
 us down to the park or other places.  
 Sometimes we do sponsered walks to    
 raise money for the youth club.
