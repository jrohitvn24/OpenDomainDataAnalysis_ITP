		<content> The rules of STICKY TOFFEE            
 __________________________            
 Number of people: 4 to 10             
 One person is 'it' and they out out   
 their hands.  Everybody else holds out
 their fingers and 'it' says "Iwent    
 down to the corner shop to buy        
 some....", and he names a commodity.  
 If he says "Sticky Toffee" then       
 everybody runs away.  If 'it' catches 
 someone then they have to stand still 
 with their arms horizontally.  They   
 can be released by someone running    
 under their arms.  If someone is      
 caught three times then they are 'it'.
