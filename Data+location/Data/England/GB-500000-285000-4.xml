		<title>04CONSERVATION IN STOKE DOYLE</title>
		<content>    Mr.Knight, one of the farmers in   
 Stoke Doyle, runs a 1,000 acre farm.  
 Like many famers he gets blamed for   
 destroying a lot of vegetation like   
 hedgerows. So to put a stop to that he
 plants things that have nothing to do 
 with his main crops. In the corner of 
 one field he has planted some conifers
 and in a rather wet area nearby       
 another local farmer has planted      
 several different types of wild grass 
 - over 60 types altogether. These     
 farmers don't get any money for doing 
 this. They do it of their own free    
 will and to make the landscape much   
 nicer. Also we saw the farmer's dog   
 catch a rabbit in one of the new      
 pieces of woodland, so he likes it    
 too!                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
