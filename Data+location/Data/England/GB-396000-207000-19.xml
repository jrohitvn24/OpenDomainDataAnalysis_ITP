		<content> The combine harvester will collect the
 peas in July and barley just before   
 the wheat in August/September.With no 
 pea-canning factory in the area and   
 barley not good enough for seed and   
 malting,all crops go for animal feed. 
 Fungal diseases on the crops and too  
 dry soil in a drought are two of the  
 main problems.The farm has 2 tractors,
 1 combine harvester with 2 for spare  
 parts, and a collection of ploughs ,  
 discs,harrows and sprays that are used
 to prepare the soil,sow the seeds,    
 spread fertiliser and generally kill  
 weeds and bugs.The farmer works       
 closely with scientific advisers to   
 get the best yields.The machinery     
 makes it possible to do what once     
 would have needed more men.The farmer 
 is also the mechanic to save money and
 time.There are many kinds of wildlife 
 tolerated as long as no damage is done</content>
