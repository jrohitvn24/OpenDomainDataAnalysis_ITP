		<content>    {The Church of England Primary     
{School}is sited towards the top of    
 School Hill to the north of the       
 village centre.                       
     It opened in{1836}thanks to the   
 foresight of the vicar Robert Hawkins,
 William Moreland of Court Lodge and   
 Edward Hussey of Scotney Castle. A few
 years later the second storey, Dutch  
 Gables and impressive{clock tower}were
 added. This two-faced clock keeps the 
 village informed of each passing hour.
 The spiral stone staircase is trodden 
 weekly by the blacksmith from the next
 door{forge}to re-wind the weights. The
 weather vein above was also made at   
 the forge. The new infants school was 
 added in 1894.                        
    Today the 94, 5 to 11 year olds,   
 enjoy the old building with its modern
 improvements, which include indoor    
 toilets and a{swimming pool.          </content>
