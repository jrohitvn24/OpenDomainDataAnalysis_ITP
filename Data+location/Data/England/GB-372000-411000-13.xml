		<content> Land use in this area can be divided  
 into two main categories.Intensively  
 managed grassland which is sown,      
 fertilised and used for pasture or cut
 as hay or silage,accounts for about   
 half the area of farmland.Rough       
 grazing land though unsown and little 
 fertilised is enclosed for grazing.   
 Most of the intensively managed       
 grassland is used for grazing         
 cattle.Milk is produced and is either 
 bottled at the farm or picked up daily
 by tanker and sent elsewhere for      
 bottling and distribution.Some fields 
 are sown and the grass is harvested   
 and stored for use as fodder during   
 the winter months.When the cows come  
 to the end of their milking life they 
 are sold as beef.                     
 Most of the farmland in the area is   
 undulating and can only be used to    
 produce grass.                        </content>
