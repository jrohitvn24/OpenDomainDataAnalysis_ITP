 Staindrop is one of County Durham's   
 green villages which has developed    
 westward from the church. There are   
 attractive stone built houses         
 surrounding the green, while modern   
 development has taken place to the    
 west and south-east of the village.   
 The rest of the survey area is largely
 taken up with farmland and wooded     
 areas. Included are several farms     
 which are fairly typical of farms in  
 this area.                            
 There is no manufacturing industry in 
 the village and employment is largely 
 in service or 'one man' industries    
 with the exeption of the local schools
 and the 'Raby Estate'.
