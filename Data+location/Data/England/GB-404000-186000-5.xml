		<title>05The Purton Magazine</title>
		<content> The Purton Magazine was the idea of   
 the local vicar who saw the need for a
 community publication. The magazine is
 distributed to subscribers by a       
 network of volunteers.                
    The magazine costs twelve pence and
 is financed from advertisements by    
 local traders and through             
 subscriptions. It is a good example of
 a publication which provides          
 information and a point of contact for
 people living in the country          
 districts.                            
    The content is extensive and       
 varied. There is a "What's on in      
 Purton" feature where monthly meetings
 and activities are listed. An unusual 
 feature is "Purton Personality", a    
 sketch of a local character whose     
 identity is revealed in the next      
 issue.                                
                                       </content>
