		<content>   Halifax seems to have been the last 
 place in England to retain the old    
 Anglo-Saxon practice of beheading     
 thieves.Certain lords of the manor had
 rights and privileges granted by the  
 crown.These enabled the lord to       
 execute certain classes of people     
 found guilty of theft of goods        
 exceeding 5 pence,in value.In most    
 parts of the country this practice    
 died out during the 14th century,but  
 it continued in Halifax until 1650    
 when the last execution took place.In 
 about 1770,after the Gibbet had been  
 neglected for a number of years,it was
 used as a rubbish dump.The site was   
 only rediscovered in 1839 when the    
 rubbish was being cleared.In early    
 1974 the platform was fully           
 reconstructed and a replica           
 of the blade is preserved in Bankfield
 museum.                               </content>
