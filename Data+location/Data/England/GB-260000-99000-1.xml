		<title>01Sampford Courtney and area</title>
		<content> This block covers the remaining half  
 of the village of Exbourne,the village
 of Sampford Courtney and the country  
 side between.                         
 It is a rural area,predominantly      
 pasture with a small area of moorland.
 The village of Sampford Courtney is   
 virtually unchanged since it is a     
 Conservation Area and new building    
 strictly controlled.                  
 Sampford is a very pretty village,    
 cottages are expensive and mainly     
 owned by retired people.There is no   
 school and the few children attend    
 Exbourne or South Tawton schools.     
 There are about  150 people actually  
 living in the village and about 400 in
 the area.
