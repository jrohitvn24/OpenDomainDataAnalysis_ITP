		<content>{ }Most of the area consists of open   
 farmland, with large fields divided by
 hedges.Exceptions are Gamston and     
 Eaton Woods. These ancient deciduous  
 parish woods cover 160 acres. They are
 owned by the Nottinghamshire Trust for
 Natue Conservation and are a nature   
 reserve.Part of Gamston Wood is a     
 site of Special Scientific Interest.  
  Both wods are valuable wildlife sites
 rich in bird life and flowers.Gamston 
 Wood is said to cotain the richest    
 woodland flora in the county.Two      
 Manpower Service Commission teams are 
 working in the woods,hedging,ditching 
 and coppicing. A public footpath runs 
 through Eaton Wood. Gamston Wood is   
 open to members of the Trust only.    
  The area has a low rainfall.Winters  
 are usually mild with little snowfall.
 What pollution there is probably comes
 from the power stations on the R.Trent</content>
