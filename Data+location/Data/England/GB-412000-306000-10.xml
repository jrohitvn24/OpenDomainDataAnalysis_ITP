		<title>10LIFE AT WHITTINGTON BARRACKS</title>
		<content>My Dad has been in the army for 17     
years. He is a Corporal and he gives   
the guns out and works in the armoury. 
  We live at Chester Road. The         
 ames of the other roads are Nottingham
Road, Stafford Crescent, Derby Road and
Heath Avenue. The children who live on 
Heath Avenue are those whose Dads are  
either Sergeant-Majors or higher ranks.
  In the Barracks itself there is a    
NAAFI (this stands for Navy,Army and   
Airforce Institute), a Church and a    
number of blocks set aside for young   
trainees.                              
  Outside the barracks there is a      
Regimental Museum that is open  to the 
public, and also the Pavillion where   
they play cricket and where there is   
also a public playing field.
