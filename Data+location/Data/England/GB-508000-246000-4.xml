		<content>    We  went  to see{Airship Industries
 in the  hangars  at   Cardington.  Our
 teacher is tall but these hangars were
 100x him.   We went inside the hangars
 which are 784 feet long.              
                                       
    Our  guide  took  us  to  look at a
 Skyship 600.  This  means it has  6000
 cu.m of  helium.    Beyond it  another
 similar  ship  was  also  being built.
 The guide showed us around and told us
 about them.                           
                                       
    The  balloon  has a  double skin to
 keep the helium inside because the gas
 is  always  trying  to  escape.  There
 were 30-40 weights holding it down, as
 otherwise it would float to the top of
 the hangar.   The  gondola  underneath
 could carry 18 passengers and two crew
 to fly it.                            
                                       </content>
