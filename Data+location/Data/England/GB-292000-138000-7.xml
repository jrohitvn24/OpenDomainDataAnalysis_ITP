		<title>07The School.</title>
		<content> To find out how old the school is we  
 looked in the School Log Book. The    
 little class was built before 1876    
 because in the old log book it said   
 the school was opened in 1876.        
                                       
 In 1956 the school was very noisy as  
 the workmen were removing the door and
 they were taking up the floor. The    
 large classroom was very cold without 
 a door only a tarpaulin stopped the   
 cold weather coming in. All the new   
 buildings took a whole year to make.  
                                       
 In 1961 during the Easter holidays    
 suspended ceilings were put up.
