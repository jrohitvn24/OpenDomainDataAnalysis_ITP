		<content>{Woburn Garden Centre}is situated      
 at the approach to Woburn Abbey. It   
 specializes in shrubs and plants. The 
 busiest time of the year is March to  
 June, when they get about 2000 people 
 at the weekend but not so many in the 
 week. They get a few American         
 tourists. Some of the sheds, pottery  
 and stone statues sold are made       
 locally. They also sell pet foods and 
 fish. The{Camping Centre}is adjacent  
 to the Garden Centre. It sells a wide 
 variety of camping equipment including
 frame and trailer tents. Frame tents  
 are most popular because people do not
 like pulling trailers on their cars.  
 There is also a shop selling          
 accessories ranging from camping      
 cookers to torches. The busiest time  
 of the year is July and August and    
 when the weather is very hot.
