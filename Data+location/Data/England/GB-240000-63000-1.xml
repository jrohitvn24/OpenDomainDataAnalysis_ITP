		<title>01Tamar Valley _ Introduction</title>
		<content>    This area is the Tamar Valley,     
 bisected almost equally by the River  
 Tamar which divides Cornwall to the   
 west and Devon to the east.           
    The area is mainly agricultural,   
 with scattered hamlets and inhabited  
 farms.                                
    In the following pages we have     
 dealt briefly with life as it is in   
 1985, particularly in relation to     
 employment, and recreation, as well as
 conservation, farming and river life. 
    Special attention has been given to
 the more prominent places namely      
 Halton Barton, the Pentillie Estate,  
 Weir Quay and Halton Quay.            
    The accompanying photographs are   
 chosen to give a pictorial impression 
 of both countryside and river.
