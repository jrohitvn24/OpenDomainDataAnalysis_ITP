		<title>10   Langley Priory</title>
		<content>    In 1539 Langley Priory was built   
 for the Benedictine Nuns.Later in     
 Georgian and Victorian times,         
 additions were made to the building.  
 In particular there is an early       
 Georgian drain with the date 1690 on  
 it.                                   
    Henry VIII was the first owner of  
 the Priory and he sold the house, by  
 charter, to the Grey family then sold 
 the house to the Cheslyns and they,   
 sold it to the Shakespeare family who,
 in turn sold it to the Hines.  Four   
 years ago the Hine family sold the    
 Priory to the Wagstaffs who are the   
 present owners in 1985.  Inside the   
 house is a room that has 14th Century 
 tapestries like the Priory, are listed
 which means they can never be sold and
 must always stay in the house.
