		<content> Most of the houses across the road    
 from the school have{bay windows}that 
 stick out from the house wall; these  
 houses were{built in the 1930's}and   
 are built{of bricks}and have{tiled    
{roofs.}Most of the very{old houses}are
 built{of stone}and have{slate         
{roofs}like the{school}which was built 
 in{1911.}Some have leaded lights or   
 windows made of small pieces of glass 
 joined together with strips of lead.  
 Some houses have space for a car to   
 get up the side to a garage but many  
 are too close together for that. Most 
 of them have{gardens}of different     
 sizes. Many of the houses near school 
{terraced,}some are{semi-detached      
 and a few are{detached.}There are some
 council houses which were built in the
 1920's but the{newest houses}are the  
 private ones built behind the school  
 in the{1970's.                        </content>
