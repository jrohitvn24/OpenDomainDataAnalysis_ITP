		<content> The original Parish Church of Wilton  
 dating from the Middle Ages &amp; now     
 derelict, can still be seen in the    
 Market Square. Present day Anglicans  
 enjoy a fine, large, Italianate church
 built 150 years ago in West St.Regular
 services are held there and in the    
 Priory Church of St.John Baptist,     
 Wilton; St.Catherine, Netherhampton,  
 &amp; St.Peter, Fugglestone. Members of   
 the free church in the area must      
 travel to Wilton for regular services.
 There is a Baptist Church (once the   
 Town Hall) in the Market Square and   
 close by is St.Edith's. This church,  
 named after the patron saint of       
 Wilton, was once the Council Chamber  
 &amp; is now shared by the Methodist and  
 United Reformed Church and the Roman  
 Catholics of the area. There is a     
 spiritualst group in the town.About 8%
