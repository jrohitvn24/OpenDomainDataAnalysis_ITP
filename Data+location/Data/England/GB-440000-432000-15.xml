		<title>15SCHOOL DINNERS</title>
		<content> It costs 6Op a day for a school       
 dinner. We have a cafeteria system,   
 that is you are given a plastic tray  
 and you then collect your own food    
 from the dinner ladies. We eat our    
 dinners in the school hall. Some of   
 the food we eat is nice but most of it
 is awful. For example, the shredded   
 carrot has bits of brown in it and    
 left over meat from yesterday is used 
 for salad and it is all dried up. The 
 nice things are sausage and bean      
 rounders and apricot dessert. The     
 worst meal of the year is Christmas   
 dinner. Most of the food is cold and  
 soggy. Because the dinners were awful,
 I brought sandwiches.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
