		<content>   There is  variety of landscape in   
 the area, with small wooded valleys,  
 open parkland, the wide flat valleys  
 of the drained River Rother estuary   
 and the gently-sloping fields of      
 pasture or arable farming. There are  
 145 small ponds in the area, scattered
 so that every other field seems to    
 have a pond or two in it.             
   These differing habitats mean that  
 different wildlife can be seen. Mr A. 
 Lloyd, the author who has lived at    
 Lambsland Farm for 18 years, regularly
 watches weasels and other small       
 mammals scurrying about his garden.   
   Otters no longer hunt in Otter      
 Channel, but wild mink are becoming   
 more common.                          
   Angling, ferreting and other country
 sports are popular pastimes but some  
 changes in farming methods may be     
 affecting the natural environment.    </content>
