		<content> There are a lot of different types of 
 houses in the area some are detached  
 and a few are terraced,several are    
 farmhouses.They are well spread       
 out.There are a few new houses in the 
 area but most are old houses.A lot of 
 them have been modernised.Some of the 
 modern houses have gas or electric    
 fires and central heating while some  
 of the older houses have coal fires   
 and chimneys.The old houses are made  
 of stone while the newer ones are made
 of brick with tiled roofs, the old    
 houses have slate roofs. Most of the  
 houses  are privately owned but a few 
 are council houses.At the crossroads  
 in Bosley there is a small site for   
 mobile homes.
