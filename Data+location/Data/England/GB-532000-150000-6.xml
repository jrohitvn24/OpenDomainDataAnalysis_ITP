		<content> Godstone has changed a lot over the   
 years and the Bay Pond did not always 
 have as much rubbish in it as it has  
 nowadays. The pond on the Green used  
 to be for watering horses and for     
 steam engines. Godstone used to have  
 its own windmill also. It is          
 surrounded by farms and rope was made 
 on the Green. Blechingley also has    
 changed greatly and an annual Fete is 
 a great village event. On the Green   
 are five-a-side football events whilst
 there are many stalls and attractions.
