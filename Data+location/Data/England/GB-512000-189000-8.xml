		<title>08OLD PEOPLE'S FLATS, HARROW.</title>
		<content>  In{Hatch End,}there are some new     
 retirement flats for people over 60   
 years old. They have all the          
 facilities for the needs of someone   
 old who cannot move or walk very far. 
 If the people fall over, they have a  
 special{alarm cord}to pull. This alarm
 goes to the{wardens' flats}and the    
{office.}The warden can speak to them  
 through the{speaker}which goes to     
 their room.                           
  The Acorn Flats are better for a     
 single person because the flats are   
 very small but the Briar and Chestnut 
 Flats would be for a couple because   
 they are bigger.                      
  The{residents' lounge}is for the     
 people to come and chat to each other.
                                       
  The flats are near to the shops,     
 station and bus stops.
