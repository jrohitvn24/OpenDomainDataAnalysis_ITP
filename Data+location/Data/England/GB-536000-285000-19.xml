		<content>    Dave-Boy Green is the local        
 boxing hero in Chatteris. He became   
 interested in boxing when he was      
 small, when a friend invited him to   
 join the local amateur boxing club.   
    His first manager gave him the most
 help in his career. He was about 19   
 when he first took boxing seriously,  
 and in September 1974 he became       
 professional. His family did not mind 
 him boxing as they knew he was in good
 hands.In his amateur career he lost 31
 and won 74 fights. In his professional
 career he lost 4 and won 37. When     
 training he ran 5 miles per day. His  
 best opponent was Sugar Ray Leonard.He
 was overwhelmed when he won the       
 British title.                        
    He retired when he thought the     
 sparkle had gone. He is married and   
 has three children. He still lives in 
 Chatteris.                            </content>
