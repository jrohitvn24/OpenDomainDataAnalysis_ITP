		<title>03St. Annes Church Carlecotes</title>
		<content> This small church, the only one left  
 in the area still conducting services,
 is a part of the estate of the nearby 
{Carlecotes Hall.                      
 The normal twice monthly services     
 attract an average congrgation of     
 about 10 people but the{Harvest       
{Festival}in late September and the    
{Carol Service}at Christmas are        
 popular and well attended. Couples    
 require special permission to be      
 married in the church as Carlecotes is
 not a parish and this is obtained from
 the Archbishop of Canterbury's office.
 In the event of the church authorities
 withdrawing services the church will  
 revert to the Hall. Services are      
 conducted by clergy from Penistone and
 Thurlstone.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
