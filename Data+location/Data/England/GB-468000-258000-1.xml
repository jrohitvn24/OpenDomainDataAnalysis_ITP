 with two dormitary villages of{Harpole
 and{Kislingbury}which serve the town  
 of{ Northampton}.Set around these     
 villages is farmland which is mainly  
 used for the grazing of sheep and     
 cattle.However,a fair proportion is   
 used for growing crops,mainly oil seed
 rape.                                 
{ Geographically,}the area has one main
 natural feature and one main'man made'
 feature.The former is the{River Nene  
 which splits the area into two equal  
 halves from west to east.The latter   
 feature is the{M1 Motorway}which was  
 built is in{1963}and serves as the    
 main route to{North}from{London.
