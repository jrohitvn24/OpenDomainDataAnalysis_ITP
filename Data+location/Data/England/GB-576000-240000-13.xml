		<title>13PRESERVED WOODLAND</title>
		<content>  There are two areas of{'preserved    
{woodland',}this means they will always
 be there as no trees can be cut down  
 without permission. Both are part of  
{Woodbarns Farm Knowle Green,}one is   
 called{Mashay Wood}and the other is   
{Twelve Acre Wood}even though it is    
 really 32 acres. A haven of wild life.
 Most of the large trees are oak,      
 nearly all the elm trees are dead     
 because of the{'dutch elm disease'    
 There are also maple, ash, hornbeam,  
 hazel, willow, spindle, hawthorn      
 around the edges and some scrub and   
 black-berries. There are all sorts of 
{wild flowers,}some extremely rare such
 as{Herb Paris}and{Oxlips.}There are   
 foxes,grey squirrels,jays,redstarts,  
 treecreepers,magpies,longtailed tits, 
 pheasants,partridges, as well as all  
 the common woodland birds, blackbirds,
 thrush,robins,cuckoos,pigeons,sparrows</content>
