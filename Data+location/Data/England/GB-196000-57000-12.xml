		<title>12LEGENDS OF ROCHE ROCK</title>
		<content>{Roche Rock}towers above the heathland 
 a large granite mass with the ruins of
 a Chapel on the top can be seen for   
 miles around.The Chapel, named after  
 St.Michael is early 15th century and  
 was built after the fashion of a 3    
 tiered Cornish tower. The upper room  
 was the Chapel with the lower         
 accomodating the Chaplain. Under its  
 floor, cut into the bed-rock, it is   
 said there is a hermit's cell.        
 One version of the legend of{Jan      
{Tregeagle}says that when fleeing from 
 the Devil, he gained refuge by        
 sticking his head in through the east 
 window of the Chapel.                 
 The Rock provided sanctuary for the   
 last member of the Tregarrick family, 
 said to be a{leper}who was tended by  
 his daughter, who brought him water   
 each day from a now vanished well     
 beneath the Rock.                     </content>
