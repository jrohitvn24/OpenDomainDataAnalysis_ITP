		<content>  WINTER AND SUMMER.                   
 We very rarely have snow and frost.   
 The winters in Newlyn are not very    
 cold.                                 
 Sometimes we get very strong winds.   
 There is a lot of misty rain.         
                                       
 POLLUTION.                            
 Newlyn Beach is polluted because of   
 the sewage system which leaves        
 waste,also the beach is very stony    
 and covered in tar.Plastic bottles &amp;  
 other mucky things.We think Harveys   
 Shellfish Factory pollutes the water  
 by putting boiling soapy water into   
 the river which leads to the sea.On a 
 hot day the sea &amp; beach smells of     
 sewage,dead fish &amp; seaweed,that is    
 why we think not many holiday makers  
 go to Newlyn Beach.We hope something  
 is done about it during the next few  
 years.                                </content>
