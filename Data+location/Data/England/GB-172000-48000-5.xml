		<content> There are strong W.I's at St. Agnes,  
 St. Agnes Breannick,  and Mithian.    
 The Gardening Association has a very  
 large membership and stages two very  
 successful Produce and Craft shows    
 each year.                            
 Scouts, Guides, Cubs, and Brownies are
 run for the younger element.          
 A Miners and Mechanics Institute,     
 which is perhaps the wealthiest group 
 in the village, exists for the men.   
 A Monday Club provides an interest for
 ladies of all ages, with demonstrators
 and speakers offering a wide variety. 
 One of the more recently formed groups
 is the St. Agnes Museum Trust whose   
 main objective is to preserve old     
 buildings and other items of interest.
 A Floral Art Club stages exhibitions  
 in the Church Hall.                   
 An Age Concern caravan in the car park
 provides morning coffee on weekdays.  </content>
