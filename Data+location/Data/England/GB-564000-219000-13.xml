		<content>   Since the closure of the railway    
 between Braintree and Bishop's        
 Stortford, in 1952, public transport  
 in and around the villages of         
 Barnston, Little Dunmow and Felsted   
 has consisted of a limited bus        
 service, and the majority of people   
 rely on private cars for transport,   
 and to a lesser extent on motor or    
 pedal cycles.                         
                                       
   Children living over a three mile   
 radius from their schools are         
 transported by buses provided by      
 the Education Authority.              
                                       
   All industrial and commercial goods 
 are carried by lorries or vans.
