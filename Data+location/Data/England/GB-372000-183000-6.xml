		<title>06Chipping Sodbury Common.</title>
		<content> Chipping Sodbury Common used to be all
 bushes in the 1930's before the war.  
 But then it was turned into farm land 
 for growing cereal crops,because of   
 the need for food during the war.Cows 
 graze on the Common from 31st of May -
 31st November.You find Friesian cows, 
 hefiers young cows, and bullocks.The  
 golf course was put on the Common just
 after the war.The holes on the golf   
 course have been fenced off because   
 the cows graze by the holes,and the   
 golfers have to climb over the fence. 
 There is not much housing on the      
 common.On the Common it is mostly farm
 houses.There is a lot of dairy farming
 on the Common.People use the Common   
 for outdoor recreation such as walking
 picnics,riding and jogging.The common 
 is mis-used by some people as they    
 dump or leave household rubbish.
