		<title>17Saturday in Halesowen</title>
		<content> On Saturday morning I wake at 9am. I  
 wash and dress and go downstairs      
 into the kichen. I let Rusty, my dog, 
 out and then I feed my fish called    
 Spike. I switch the TV on and watch   
 the cartoons. My mom usually makes my 
 breakfast - cornflakes and a cup of   
 tea. I don't see my dad because he    
 goes to work at 6.00am. He is a tool  
 maker. Later, my brother Jason joins  
 us. Usually I go into Halesowen with  
 my mom.We buy our food at the         
 supermarket and then return home on   
 the bus. Back home we have our lunch -
 usually beef burgers and chips. I     
 often go with my mom to Birmingham to 
 buy things with my pocket money.      
 Evening is spent out playing with my  
 friends, returning home before dark.  
 Mom, dad, Jason and I watch TV again  
 before I get sent to bed at 11.30pm, a
 late night, but it is the weekend!    </content>
