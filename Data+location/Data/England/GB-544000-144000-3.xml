     There are 2 railway stations in   
 Edenbridge, but only one in our       
 Domesday block.There are 4 petrol     
 stations in our square. A survey      
 we did showed that about 225 vehicles 
 used the High Street in a 15 minute   
 period in mid-afternoon.              
       The trains from the bottom      
 station go to Oxted,London &amp;          
 Uckfield, and the trains from the top 
 station go to Redhill &amp; Tonbridge.On  
 Sundays the trains do not run.They are
 thinking of running a high-speed train
 through Edenbridge.There is 1 bus     
 station in Edenbridge.At the moment a 
 possibility of a by-pass is growing.We
 asked 50 people what they think of a  
 by-pass being built in the Edenbridge 
 area.15% said' the possibility is     
 growing.'....by Paul Stanyer &amp; Gary
