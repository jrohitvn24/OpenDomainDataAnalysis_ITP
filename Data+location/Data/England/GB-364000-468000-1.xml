 High and Low Bentham are in North     
 Yorkshire about 10 miles north east of
 Lancaster. To the north and east are  
 the limestone hills of the Yorkshire  
 Dales. To the west is the Lune Valley 
 and on the southern edge is Burnmoor. 
 The River Wenning is a tributary of   
 the River Lune. The railway runs from 
 Carnforth to Leeds. The two settlemets
 have a combined population of about   
 4000. High Bentham is the larger and  
 possesses most of the industry. George
 Angus is the main employer. The       
 factory makes fire fighting equipment.
 There is a good range of services,    
 shops,garages,accountants,solicitors, 
 auctioneers and a health centre. The  
 local affairs are looked after by the 
 mayor and Town Council.  The villages 
 are not particularly pretty but serve 
 a lively active community.            </content>
