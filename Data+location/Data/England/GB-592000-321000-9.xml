		<title>09Horningtoft Church</title>
		<content> Horningtoft Church is called St       
 Edmunds because the church was built  
 in the times of Edward the third.     
  It is mainly built of stone.The doors
 are built of wood and the floor is    
 made of stone.                        
  The church has no tower because it   
 fell down in 1796.It caused a lot of  
 damage to the church,but everything   
 was repaired and redecorated the next 
 year.                                 
  The organ is in the nave next to the 
 vestery which is where the priest gets
 changed and where he gets things      
 ready.The seats in the nave are not   
 pews but fold up chairs.They are made 
 of wood and there are 85 of them.     
  The font is on the south side of the 
 church and many people have been      
 baptised in it.The pulpit is in the   
 nave near the chancel on the north    
 side.          CONTINUED ON PAGE 10   </content>
