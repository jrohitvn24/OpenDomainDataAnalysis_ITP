		<content> Apart from woodland almost the whole  
 project area is given over to farming.
 The farms vary considerably in size.  
 The largest farm, in the centre of the
 area, is a mixed farm of 1200 acres,  
 200 acres down to grass, and 1000     
 acres arable; 200 acres of peas, 400  
 acres of wheat and 400 acres of       
 barley. 200 bullocks have been bought 
 in, fattened on barley, and sold.It is
 significant that there are no dairy   
 cattle on this farm.This particular   
 farm specializes in raising racehorces
 even buying them in from New Zealand. 
 The farm employs four full time men   
 and two part time men. The racehorses 
 keep up to twenty people employed,    
 according to the season.              
 Other farms in the area are generally 
 mixed, although some concentrate on   
 pigs or sheep. It is interesting to   
 note the decline in dairy farming.    </content>
