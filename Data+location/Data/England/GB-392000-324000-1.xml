    Our area may be divided into two   
main categories.One half is heavily    
built up with mainly terraced          
properties and industrial units,while  
the other half is mainly farm land.    
     There is also a large R.A.F.site  
(16-M.U.)in our area,which is a supply 
and service unit for other R.A.F.bases.
     There is a County Showground used 
for many different exhibitions and     
displays,and a piece of "common        
land"which is used by fairs and        
circuses.                              
     There are two very well known     
factories,Lotus Shoes,and Evode        
Adhesives Works as well as many other  
industrial units.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
