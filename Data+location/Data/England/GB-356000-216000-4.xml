 On the 6th  June 1985 we went out to  
 ask people in shops if they were      
 shopping there.First of all we        
 interviewed some shoppers. The first  
 one we interviewed was at 10-14 am at 
 Bishops Wood Petrol Station joined on 
 to Wyeside Caravans LTD.              
    We interviewed two people from     
 Goodrich Post Office.One person was an
 old man waiting for his pension and   
 the other was a middle-aged woman     
 trying to get her daily needs like    
 bread and milk. Next we interviewed a 
 young boy around 11 years old his name
 was Samual Tomlin.  We interviewed him
 at 11-20 am at Little Chef.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
