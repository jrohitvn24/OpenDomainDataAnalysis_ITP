		<title>13DERWENT VALLEY - WILD LIFE</title>
		<content> The only known breeding ground of the 
 rare grass snake is a secret location 
 in the valley.                        
    Rare flowers include the Common    
 Helloborine and Marsh Orchid. The     
 alien Hymalayan Balsam dominates the  
 river banks.                          
    Butterflies are few in number.     
 Quite common are Large, Small and     
 Green-veined Whites, small copper,    
 common blue, dingy and large skippers,
 meadow brown, small heath and small   
 tortoiseshell. Migrants also occur.   
 Red Admirals and Painted Ladies are   
 often seen. The Clouded Yellow was    
 seen in 1984. Most local butterflies  
 have declined in numbers; Dark Green, 
 Small Pearl Bordered Fritillaries,    
 Orange Tip, Wall Brown and Peacock.   
 A small colony of Purple Hairstreak is
 in the valley. Larger moths include   
 the Elephant and the Poplar Hawk.     </content>
