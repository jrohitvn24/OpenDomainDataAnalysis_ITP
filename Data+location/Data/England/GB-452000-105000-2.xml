		<content> The church was built in the year 680  
 by the Saxons.The church takes every  
 Christian on any day.It has had bits  
 added on to it over the years and is  
 now quite big.Forty-two vicars have   
 worked here since 1302.The oldest part
 of the church is the nave and the most
 modern part of the church is the choir
 vestry.There are seven bells in the   
 church and about thirty-four stained  
 glass windows.Tom Pemberton has been a
 vicar for nineteen years and has      
 worked at Titchfield church for twelve
 years.No-one is buried here in coffins
 any more but people still have their  
 ashes spread in a little part of the  
 graveyard by the river.The vicar's    
 wages are paid by members of the      
 church.The church is in Church Street 
 and the vicar lives next to it.St.    
 Peter's is a Church Of England church.
