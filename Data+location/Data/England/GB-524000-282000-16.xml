		<content>                                       
 Upwood Manor used to be owned by the  
 Cromwells.It was one big house but now
 it's been split into three parts.     
 Duncan Bell's family own the biggest  
 part.Under the main hall there is     
 supposed to be a passage leading to   
 Ramsey Abbey or to a possible nearby  
 wood.The walls of the House are made  
 of reeds,animal furs and dung.There is
 a hole in one of the bedrooms to a    
 derelict servant's room.In there you  
 can see how the walls and how the     
 roof were made.In the back garden you 
 can see the chimneys and the warren   
 which used to be full of rabbits.
