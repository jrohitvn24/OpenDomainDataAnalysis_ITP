 play until bed time (9:00pm).On Sunday
 I go to Sunday school,the family lie  
 in,then do jobs.Lunch is at 1:00pm    
 then I play out or help Mum and Dad.  
 Andrew goes to pop group practice. Mum
 makes tea at 5:30 then we watch T.V.  
 until bed time.Sunday is different    
 from week days because there's no     
 school or work, but there is church.  
 Our family's favourite food is Chinese
 and our hobbies are playing, singing  
 or listening to music.
