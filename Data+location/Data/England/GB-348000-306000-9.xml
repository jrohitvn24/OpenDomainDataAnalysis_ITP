		<content>   I help my dad to take chemicals to  
 farms and see all the animals.We walk 
 in the fields to see if the crops have
 got any diseases.If they haven't got a
 sprayer,my dad can get the spraying   
 machine.He has a shop where he sells  
 wormer and drench and hires out a bird
 scarer machine.                       
   I do horse riding and I can jump    
 about five feet.You have to muck out  
 every week.You have to clean all your 
 tack. The leather has to be cleaned   
 with saddle soap.When the coat of the 
 horse is very dirty you have to get a 
 little bowl of water and tip it all   
 over the horse.Then brush it down.    
   I go shooting with my dad.Every time
 you go to a competition you have to   
 clean the gun.You have to clean the   
 barrels so that it doesn't affect the 
 shot.                                 
                                       </content>
