		<title>02ARMY BARRACKS</title>
		<content> The Royal Engineers moved from        
 Southwood in 1979 to{Gibraltar        
{Barracks,}nearer the Ministry Of      
 Defence training area.                
 Every 11 weeks, 800 soldiers come to  
 the barracks for a basic training     
 course. For 2 weeks of this they are  
 joined by Territorial Army recruits.  
 It is a very modern site and          
 facilities include squash courts, a   
 gym and a swimming pool open to the   
 public. Single officers live opposite 
 the barracks in{Minley Manor,}which is
 also used for offices. Existing       
 buildings have been adopted to serve  
 the army.                             
 There is pressure from the public to  
 move the army because of the          
 disturbance they make. The area might 
 also be suitable for housing. One good
 thing is that the army provide        
 employment for about 200 civilians.   </content>
