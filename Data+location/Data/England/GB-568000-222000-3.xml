		<title>03  MR BUCKNELL</title>
		<content>  Mr. Bucknell came to be a farmer     
 because his family are farmers. He was
 born in Witham at Warren Farm. Mr.    
 Bucknell says that he could make more 
 money doing another job,but he enjoys 
 his life style. His neighbors are kind
 so that makes it a better living. He  
 has be very careful to weigh up the   
 cost of new machinery. He dosen't like
 it when there is bad weather because  
 he loses a lot of crops and,          
 therefore, money. He usually works    
 from eight until five but at Harvest  
 time he may work over night until     
 about 1.00 in the morning. He said    
 that farming was very hard work. In   
 his spare time he likes to shoot game 
 in his own wood. He also enjoys       
 photography and does lots of it. He   
 lives with his wife and small son.
