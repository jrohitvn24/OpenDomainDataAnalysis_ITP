		<content> Dowty Mining is a large factory in    
 Ashchurch.It was built in 1943.It was 
 built here because Sir George Dowty   
 already had other factories in the    
 area.They took over an old Birds      
 Custard factory. During World War II  
 they made hydraulic landing           
 gear for aircraft. Now they make      
 pitprops.The first pitprop they made  
 was for Ramcroft Colliery in 1946. In 
 the showroom at Dowty's are two modern
 pitprops.In the room where they design
 pitprops there are about ninety       
 computers.If there was a power cut    
 they would run on a supply of         
 batteries.In that room we met a group 
 of 7 Chinese people so that shows that
 Dowty's is international.Outside there
 are pitprops all lined up as they     
 would be in mines.Modern pitprops also
 incorporate a roof support.Then we    
 went into the factory.                </content>
