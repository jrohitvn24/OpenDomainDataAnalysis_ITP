		<title>08Overton Farm, Sway.</title>
		<content> Twenty years ago there were 9 dairy   
 farms in the Sway area. The{Guernsey  
{herd}at Overton is now the only one   
 left. The 130 acres of land on the    
 farm are given over to grass which is 
 used for grazing and producing enough 
 silage and hay to feed the herd during
 the winter. Between October and April 
 when the cows are kept undercover each
 cow consumes 6 tons of silage, 100    
 bales of hay and uses 120 bales of    
 straw for bedding. High protein dairy 
 nut consumption during the year works 
 out at 1.5 tons per animal. E.E.C.    
 quotas on milk production penalise    
 farmers who produce a surplus and a   
 few pigs are kept at Overton which are
 fed on any excess milk which might be 
 produced.
