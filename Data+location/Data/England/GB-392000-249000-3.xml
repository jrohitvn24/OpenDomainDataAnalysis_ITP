		<title>03Games children play</title>
		<content> We conducted a survey in our two local
 schools to find out what children     
 played in the playground at break     
 time.                                 
    The under nines tended to make up  
 their own games based on popular      
 television programmes in which they   
 would pretend to be characters from   
 the programmes. Examples of this type 
 of game are:{Knight Rider and A-Team. 
    Over nine boys go for traditional  
 games on the whole. They prefer to    
 play{football, cricket, rounders or   
{tennis}at break. Girls often play     
 catching games using a tennis ball. A 
 popular game is{"elastics"}at the     
 moment. In this game a large loop of  
 elastic is stretched into a rectangle 
 around two girls' legs, the aim being 
 for another to jump onto the elastic, 
 pinning it to the floor, and jump off 
 again without getting in a knot!      </content>
