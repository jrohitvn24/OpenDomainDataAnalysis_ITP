		<title>06MORE ABOUT COMBE</title>
		<content>Most of the working people from Combe  
work in Oxford, Woodstock and          
Kidlington. Combe is very popular with 
retired people which accounts for the  
large number of pensioners in the      
village. In October there is a feast   
at Combe. They have 2 fair rides and a 
lot of sideshows. There is a recently  
built housing estate in the north end  
of the village called Knotoaks. All    
the houses in Knotoaks have a tiled    
roof and three chimnies, most have     
stone walls but some are built of      
brick. There are 50 houses in Knotoaks 
and they are 3 to 4 years old.         
Local decisions are made by Combe      
Parish Council and West Oxfordshire    
District Council
