		<title>10Sudbury Snooker Club</title>
		<content>Snooker, during the last two years has 
become very popular. Two new snooker   
clubs have been built in Sudbury,and we
visited one. Sudbury Snooker Club is   
owned by Mr.and Mrs.Baldwin. There are 
10 snooker tables and a bar. The system
is run by computers. They charge 3p a  
minute or 1.80 pounds an hour. But most
people play for 1-2 hours. The member- 
ship fees are:                         
     10 pounds for 1 person,           
     12 pounds for husband and wife    
      2 pounds for spectators.         
The opening times are 10:00am - 11:30pm
They open every day except for Chrismas
Day. The busiest times are the evenings
and the Winter. They have competitions 
between members and other clubs. The   
tables at the club cost between        
1000-2000 pounds.
