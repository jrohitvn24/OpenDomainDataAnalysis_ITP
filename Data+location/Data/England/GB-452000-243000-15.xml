		<title>15A gardener at Thorpe Court.</title>
		<content>Mr Fowler travels from Sulgrave to     
Thorpe Mandeville to start work at 8.15
each morning.He waters the plants in   
three green-houses then he picks any   
vegetables that are needed in the house
for meals that day.He goes back into   
the vegetable garden and weeds until   
lunch time when he has a break for half
an hour.                               
After lunch he spends time in the      
flower garden,planting,thinning,moving 
and weeding.Once a week he cuts the    
lawns.It takes all day.He uses a sit on
mower and a small tractor.             
If it is wet he finds plenty of jobs to
do in the greenhouses and sheds.Some   
vegetables like carrots and onions are 
stored in these sheds for the winter.  
At 4.45p.m.he returns home and after   
his supper he sometimes does jobs in   
his own garden.He keeps bees there.
