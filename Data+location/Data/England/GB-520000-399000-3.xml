		<title>03The Old Rectory, Ravendale</title>
		<content> The present owners have lived in the  
 Old Rectory for just over a year.     
 Previously they owned and lived in    
 Ravendale Hall. They bought the       
 Rectory from the church and it was    
 renovated as a private dwelling. It   
 was used as the home for the Rectors  
 of Ravendale Parish up to being sold  
 to the present owners. In Victorian   
 times a private school was held in the
 attic of the Rectory.
