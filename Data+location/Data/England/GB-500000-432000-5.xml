		<content>  The church is very small and friendly
 and is surrounded by a closed         
 cemetary. It has one bell which the   
 vicar, Rev. Arthur Hill, rings. Inside
 the church there is an altar, an      
 organ, a small wooden font and a      
 lectern made of iroko wood. There is a
 large wooden cross hanging in front of
 a stained glass window.               
  The vicar wears a light green        
 cassock,an alb,a dark green stole and 
 a girdle when he takes services. There
 are two or three services on a Sunday;
 6 - 10 people attend the 8am service, 
 35 - 40 people attend the 10am service
 and 6 - 10 people attend the 6pm      
 service. There are 20 christenings and
 6 - 10 marriages a year. The vicar    
 takes weekly assemblies at the small  
 Church of England controlled village  
 school.
