		<content> The old library building has been     
 converted and now houses a dance club 
 for ballet, tap dancing, dance        
 exercises and aerobics, a pool room,  
 an amusement arcade and a night club. 
 The Arts Centre was opened in 974 and 
 provides full theatre facilities with 
 seating capacity for 373. The premises
 can be converted to a dance hall with 
 bar and kitchen and are available for 
 hire by the public.                   
 The Bingley Little Theatre presents a 
 season of plays from June to October  
 each year, while the Amateur Operatic 
 Society gives regular performances of 
 light opera to raise money for        
 charity. The Young Idea is a recently 
 formed group for young people,        
 interested in taking part in musical  
 activities.
