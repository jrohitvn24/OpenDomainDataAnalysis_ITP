		<title>16FRENCH STUDENTS IN HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> The months of July and August bring an
 influx of French students to the      
 streets of Herne Bay. Normally they   
 are teenagers and they are            
 accommodated with Herne Bay families  
 for their 25 day stay. As the families
 receive Â£180 to provide board and     
 lodging for these students they are   
 eagerly welcomed and children of the  
 family may have to share a bedroom as 
 the French students must have their   
 own room. The students mainly come to 
 improve their English and they have a 
 well planned programme of visits      
 including two trips to London and     
 other activities. Half their day is   
 devoted to sports and half to English 
 lessons. During the day they are based
 at St Mary's College an old Hotel near
 the station. The students must be at  
 the College by 9.15a.m.and they finish
 at 5.15. Must be in lodgings by 9.15pm</content>
