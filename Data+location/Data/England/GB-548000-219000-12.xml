		<title>12A MORNING IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> At 9.10am Mr Hardey said "Recorders go
 and record!"Kelda started playing her 
 recorder in the class and got a glare 
 from 'You know who!'I gave Sarah      
 Piggot my swimming money to look after
 and we went into the hall to collect  
 the music stands. Katie got her finger
 stuck and yelled out loud when Pr     
 Parker(Headmaster) was walking past.We
 felt really embarrassed.  We took the 
 music stands to the staffroom very    
 carefully just in case Mr Parker came 
 through again. We did some treble     
 recorder first, then song of the Volga
 Boatman.Then we went into the hall to 
 do it with the piano. It worked out   
 much better. The second time Mr Hardey
 came into listen.Fiona W and Helen W  
 messed it ip by giggling.Sarah lost my
 swimming money, but she eventually    
 found it in her desk.
