		<title>12TIMBER-FRAMED HOUSING</title>
		<content>{Timber-framed housing}is made by      
 first erecting a pre-fabricated       
 wooden skeleton and then screwing on  
 chipboard or plywood sheeting so that 
 the shape of the house is created     
 using the frame as an innerskin then  
 building round it with bricks.Hard    
 wood window frames are then put in    
 place together with double-glazed     
 windows.                              
 Recently the{attitude}of the public   
 towards this type of house            
 construction has adversely changed as 
 there have been complaints about the  
 wood frames rotting. Just lately      
 buildings in the course of            
 construction have been sheeted in     
 polythene cladding to prevent this.   
 Timber-framed housing conserves{energy
 as the gap between the wooden sheeting
 and brickwork is always filled with   
 heat insulation material              </content>
