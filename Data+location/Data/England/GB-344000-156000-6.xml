		<title>06Sally Busby's Riding Stables</title>
		<content>  Riding is a very popular sport, but  
 it is not only a leisure time         
 activity. Walking is the only         
 alternative to riding if you want to  
 see what is happening in the          
 countryside and walking is so slow.   
  The best way to explore the forest   
 is on a horse along the Bridle paths. 
  We had a good look at her 15         
 horses and ponies. Sally was in the   
 training ring when we arrived, so we  
 watched some cantering and trotting.  
 She uses 4 fields and the ring but she
 also takes people out on rides. She   
 helps about 35 children and 50 adults 
 each week.  In the stables the horses 
 had comfortable beds, which took up   
 most of the room. The bed was made of 
 sawdust. It costs Â£5 a week in summer 
 and up to Â£20 in winter to feed a     
 pony.
