{BROOK}is a very small village with an 
 electoral roll of less than 20 people.
 Many families are involved in farming,
 both pastoral and arable.             
  Recently though the village          
 atmosphere has changed from its       
 semi_feudal flavour.Many properties in
 the area have been bought as summer   
 homes and by older couples for        
 retirement.This has meant that the    
 solid village community has been      
 weakened.This move by summer visitors 
 to buy property is resented by the    
 locals.                               
   There are though still a few young  
 families in BROOK.When the children   
 leave school they tend to move away to
 find employment in areas of tourism.
