		<title>17TRANSPORT IN DUDLEY      </title>
		<content>     {Public transport}is provided by  
 West Midlands Passenger Transport     
 Executive's blue and cream{buses.}An  
 enlarged bus station is currently     
 being built in the town centre. Dudley
 has no{railway station}the nearest    
 being Dudley Port, (2 miles away).    
 Dudley station closed about twenty    
 years ago, although freight can still 
 be transported from the Dudley        
 Freightliner Depot. The nearest{      
{airport}is Birmingham. Dudley is      
 better served by{canals}which are used
 by pleasure craft. Two famous canal   
 tunnels run under the town. Because   
 Dudley is built on a hill, transport  
 often has difficulty entering the town
 when snow has fallen and many people  
 are late for work. A new{road,}the    
{Black Country Route}has been proposed 
 but this is not popular locally.
