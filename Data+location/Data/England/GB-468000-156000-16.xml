		<content>{Saturdays in Summer.                  
 On Saturdays I get up out of bed at   
 about 10 o'clock and play with my     
 Barbie doll.Usually after playing with
 her, I get dressed and go and get     
 breakfast and eat it in the dining    
 room. When I have finished I go to the
 drawing room to watch television. When
 the programmes that I want to watch   
 have finished I go outside to play on 
 the climbing frame.                   
 When it is lunch time I go and help   
 mummy lay the outside table and after 
 a cold lunch, we have an ice cream and
 a sweet. Then I go and settle down    
 somewhere in a sunny place and read my
 best book, "The Wishing Chair." My    
 brother and sisters keep on coming and
 talking to me so I lose my place in   
 the book. I go and tell mummy and she 
 always says keep away from them and   
 not much else. (Cont. page 17.)       </content>
