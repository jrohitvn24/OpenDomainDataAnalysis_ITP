		<title>08Main Road through Cliffe</title>
		<content>      The A63 road from Hull to Leeds  
 crosses the main street of Cliffe     
 village. It is a straight fast road   
 and for a long time people have been  
 worried about accidents at the cross  
 roads,  especially to children who    
 have to cross the main road on their  
 way to school.                        
      There are not many houses along  
 the A63 and sometimes drivers do not  
 know they are coming to a village. The
 Parish Council asked for lights to be 
 put up at the crossroads, and for a   
{speed limit}on the A63.               
      So many lights were put up that  
 there should have been an automatic   
 speed limit, but the Department of    
 Transport fixed de-restriction signs  
 on them, and says there is not enough 
 traffic for a speed limit. Since the  
 M62 was built most heavy traffic uses 
 that rather than the A63.             </content>
