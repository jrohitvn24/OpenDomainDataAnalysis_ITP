		<content>{Charter House}is an old people's home 
 in Kimbolton Road. It has 60          
 residents; the oldest is 96, the      
 youngest is 60.                       
 We went there to find out what Bedford
 used to be like and what they think of
 it now. Some said that Bedford was too
 modern, another thought that it was   
 spoilt because it used to be more like
 the countryside. Now it is a busy     
 town.                                 
 When they were young their toys       
 inculded prams, dolls and cots. Their 
 hobbies were tatting, music knitting, 
 and playing Bridge. Their hobbies now 
 are reading and doing crosswords.     
 When they were young some had to do   
 the household chores, like dusting,   
 others had servants. Landmarks then   
 were the John Bunyan and John Howard  
 statues. Most like living in {Charter 
{House}.                               </content>
