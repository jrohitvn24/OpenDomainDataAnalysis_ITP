 Before it was a{bookshoo}it was a     
{paint and decorators}shop which was   
 called Chibbets.   In the year 1976 it
 was changed from Chibbets to          
 Blackmore's Bookshop.   This bookshop 
 is named after a bookshop in London   
 also called Blackmore's Bookshop.     
     The{cobbled yard}has the original 
 cobbles which were put there the year 
 it was built.   The floor in the      
 Bookshop is very uneven because it is 
 made up{old red flagstones}which were 
 put there the year it was built.      
 The counter is made of{solid oak}which
 is very heavy.   It was used when the 
 paint and decorators shop was there.  
 The{handles on the doors}are made of  
 brass which are not used very often   
 nowadays.
