		<title>01CHARNWOOD FOREST</title>
		<content> Our D-block covers part of Charnwood  
 Forest,an ancient forest that links us
 with 1068.Although much of the land   
 has now been given over to mixed      
 farming,a considerable amount of deci_
 duous woodland remains.Tree-clad hills
 outcrops of Ancient Charnian rock,a   
 small reservoir and proximity to      
 Loughborough,makes the area attractive
 for leisure activities echoing again  
 the land usage of the Domesday deer   
 park.In the N.E. of the block,the out_
 skirts of L'boro are linked by foot_  
 path and road to recreational centres 
 as well as being only 3km from the M1 
 which traverses the area from north to
 south.The only Public House is at     
 Nanpantan,a small settlement built at 
 the head of an old short lived canal. 
 In the N.W. Associated Road Stone Co. 
 have large quarries supplying British 
 Rail with mixed hard stone.           </content>
