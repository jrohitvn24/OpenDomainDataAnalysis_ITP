		<title>02 CHURCHES  - Wootton Wawen</title>
		<content>     There are two churches in the     
 village.{St. Peter's,}the Established 
 Church, still has traces of the       
 original Saxon building: some         
 sanctuary arches, traces of roof      
 ridges and herringbone masonry.       
     Much building took place in Norman
 times (1066-1154) but important       
 alterations and additions date from   
 the reigns of early Plantagenet kings 
 (1154-1377). Further additional and   
 restoration work has been carried out 
 right up to the present day.          
     The Roman Catholic church is      
 called{St. Benedict's. }An early R.C.}
 chapel, built in 1813, stands in the  
 grounds of{Wootton Hall}but it is no  
 longer used as a chapel.  During the  
 time of religious persecution a       
 Benedictine monk lived in the Hall.
