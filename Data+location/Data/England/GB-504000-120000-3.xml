		<title>03TOAT MONUMENT, PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  Prominent amongst fields on a hill   
 about 200 feet above sea level is a   
 six sided brick tower three storeys   
 high with a battlemented top.         
  A tablet on the north side indicates 
 that the tower was erected in 1823 in 
 memory of Samuel DRINKALD, who was    
 one of three sons of the then owner of
 Toat House, John DRINKALD. John was a 
 merchant well known also for his heavy
 betting at race meetings.             
  "Toat" is said to be of Saxon        
 derivation and means "look-out". The  
 view from the tower is extensive in   
 all directions. Local legend has it   
 that John Drinkald was fond of        
 hunting. When too old to hunt he used 
 to watch the progress of the local    
 hunt from the top of the tower.
