    Mum said,"Come on Chez get out of  
 bed." So I got out of bed and had some
 breakfast.I have got two brothers,they
 are called Andrew and Allan.They are a
 lot younger.I said to Mum,"What day is
 it?""Saturday!""Oh,what shall I do?...
 I know .... Mum?""What?""Can I ring my
 friend up?"So I rang up Clare.She said
 she would come,so I went to meet her  
 on my  bike.Clare has got a racer.I   
 met her and we biked back to my house.
 Then we went to the shop and got some 
 sweets and went the other way round   
 home.By now it was about one o'clock. 
 Soon we had some dinner...an egg      
 sandwich and a bag of crisps.We went  
 out to play,then my friend biked home.
 We had tea,watched TV and then I went 
 to bed.
