		<title>12VAYNOR FIRST SCHOOL REDDITCH</title>
		<content> We interviewed{Mrs. Carlton}our       
 headteacher to get information about  
 our school and the area around it,    
 during the last 12 years while she has
 been the head, to see what things have
 changed.                              
 The school was built in 1968 and{Mrs. 
{Carlton}in 1973, there were 9 classes 
 but the numbers dropped to 6, and shot
 up to 12 in 1985. The numbers have    
 risen because of the new houses and   
 more children coming to live in the   
 area. We also have a mobile classroom,
 and we will have 2 more in September  
 1985.                                 
 There was much open space around the  
 school in 1968, and you could see the 
 Malvern Hills. There used to be a farm
 close by, but it was built upon.More  
 space around the school has been used.
 It would be a pity to see any more    
 changes which would spoil surroundings</content>
