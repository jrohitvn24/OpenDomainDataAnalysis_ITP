		<title>06Farming: Mell farm</title>
		<content> Mell Farm has 400+ Arable and 600+    
 marshland, altogether it has 1000+    
 acres.   It keeps sheep and cattle on 
 the marshland and orphaned lambs in   
 the back garden.   They grow wheat,   
 barley, rape, hay and straw.   The    
 land is gravel on highland clay half  
 way and marsh near the River          
 Blackwater.   The farm has got two    
 Renults, two Fords, one crawler       
 tractor and two trailers.   It also   
 has combines, seed-drills, ploughs,   
 discs, a dryer and a cultivator.      
 living on Mell Farm is hard work but  
 exciting and you learn each day.      
 Half the house is original Tudar.   We
 also breed pheasant chicks in the     
 spring which we then set free.   My   
 dad is going to dig out a pond  soon  
 for wild-life.
