 A rural area with an undulating, well 
 watered landscape providing lush      
 pastureland, still retaining several  
 wooded areas with a large expanse of  
 Common Land in the centre. Nestling in
 the valleys are stone built houses. A 
 thinly populated area with mixed      
 farming being the main industry. There
 are no schools or shops, the          
 population having to travel to nearby 
 towns for these amenities, although   
 still having its own Church, two      
 Public Houses,Village Halland Post    
 Office. The climate is moderate. Wild 
 Life, flora and fauna are abundant    
 mainly due to conservation of some{ }
