		<content>    It is built near to the{Roman Wall 
 which stretched west from{Newcastle}to
{Carlisle.}It is built on a hill and   
 looks over the Tyne Valley.           
    There is a church, a chapel, a     
 Memorial Hall, three public houses and
 a First School.                       
    It is a residential area which     
 looks onto farm land and has a section
 of the wall excavated so that you can 
 see the shape, size and depth of the  
 wall. It existed before the coming of 
 the Romans in the times of the{Ancient
{Britons}as a small hill fort because  
 of its commanding position.
