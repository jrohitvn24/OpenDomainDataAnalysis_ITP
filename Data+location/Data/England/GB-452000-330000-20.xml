{ }FIRE ENGINE CRASHES IN GOTHAM       
  Last year a fire engine skidded and  
 crashed in the middle of our village, 
 when it was on its way to put out a   
 fire which had started on the hills   
 just outside the village. Two boys at 
 the school heard the fire engine      
 coming.They looked round and saw the  
 fire engine skid into a wall, crushing
 a Rover in the process. The fire      
 engine turned onto its side and petrol
 began to leak from its tank.The fire- 
 men clambered out and fortunately they
 were unhurt. There was glass all over 
 the road and so the traffic had to be 
 re-directed through the side streets  
 of the village. A crane had to be     
 summoned to tow the fire engine       
 away.As it moved along the road the   
 number plate fell off, and was later  
 found on the school field.            </content>
