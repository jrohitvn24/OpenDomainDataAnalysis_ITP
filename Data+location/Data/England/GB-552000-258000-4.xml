 their parents played.Their favourite  
 game was Tig.Bottisham Primary School 
 found that this is still the most     
 popular game today.It was compared    
 with ninety_five other games.         
 Stuck In The Mud_First you choose     
 someone to be It.The person who is It 
 has to catch you.When you have been   
 caught you have to stand with your    
 legs apart until someone crawls       
 through your legs.The winner is either
 the person that's It and has everyone 
 stuck in the mud or when you can't be 
 caught. Jacks_You've got six stones on
 the ground and a rubber ball,Throw the
 ball up in the air,let it bounce,pick 
 up a stone,catch the ball in the hand 
 with the stone in.Next time you pick  
 up two stones.Continue until six are  
 picked up.
