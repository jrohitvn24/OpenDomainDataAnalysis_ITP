		<content>Burntwood is relatively modern but     
there is a long tradition of education,
dating back to the Academy founded by  
Dr. Samuel Johnson at Edial. There are 
records of small schools in the Trade  
Directories of the mid 19th Century.   
A school still remains on the site of  
the first one built in 1865, rebuilt in
1911 and subsequently modernized near  
St. Anne's in Church St. The village   
school in Hammerwich however has closed
recently.                              
The area schools date back to the      
expansion of the 1960's when Chastown  
High was built to co-exist alongside   
Chaseterrace in the Burntwood area.    
Children attend first schools from 5-9 
yrs, then move to a high school at 13  
from a middle school. There has also   
been a crisis with a threatened amalga-
mation of the two high schools but     
this is to be reviewed in 1986.        </content>
