		<title>04A FARMERS TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> The farmer has been around for        
 thousands of years,but his machinery  
 is now more developed.From the donkey 
 to the oxen to the tractor.Fields     
 which used to take a day to plough,now
 only take an hour.There are 3 farms in
 the village of Milnthorpe,Cumbria.The 
 farmers who own them are my uncle     
 Mr.Garnett,Mr.Whitfield and           
 Mr.Melling.They all get up at 5 or    
 6a.m.and do the milking.This is done  
 by attaching metal tubes to the cows  
 udders,and switching on the machine   
 and the machine extracts the milk from
 the cow.Then a milk tanker collects   
 the Milk Marketing Board.After the    
 milking has been done,the farmer might
 go for his breakfast.then he would    
 probably do any jobs that needed to be
 done e.g.fencing,walling,sillaging or 
 haytime if it was in the summer time.
