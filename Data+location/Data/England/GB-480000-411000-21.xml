<title>21New power Station</title>
<content>

The old station was finally demolished in the early 1990s and a new gas fired power station built.&lt;br />&lt;br />There was no gas supply to the village and perhaps the developers missed an opportunity to give a cheap connection to homes in the village.&lt;br />&lt;br />As with all planning applications, much was made of the jobs that would be created. In reality the build was done by contractors from Scotland and Newcastle (even hired road sweepers were from there) with only a few locals gaining employment as cleaners and labourers.&lt;br />&lt;br />There was supposed to be a second station built but the tide turned against gas fired and so this has not yet materialised.   &lt;br />
