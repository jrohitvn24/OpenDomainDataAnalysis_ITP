		<content> The older part of Barrowby village has
 been designated a conservation area.  
 The church of All Saints is the oldest
 building in Barrowby and was mentioned
 in the original Domesday Book. It is  
 a grade one listed building. There are
 other listed buildings (grade 2)      
 within the area, these being -        
 Barrowby Old Hall, Barrowby House,    
 Summerhouse to Barrowby House, Brydon 
 House, Malting House and Hall Cottage.
 Anyone wishing to demolish a building 
 in the conservation area must apply to
 the District Planning Authority. Also 
 any alterations or extensions to be   
 made to a building must be designed   
 and constructed in materials similar  
 to the original building. Residents   
 are asked that hedgerows, trees and   
 walls are kept in their original      
 positions wherever possible.
