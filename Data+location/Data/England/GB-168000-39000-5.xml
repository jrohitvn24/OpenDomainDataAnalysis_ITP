		<title>05Carn Brea</title>
		<content> Carn Brea is between Camborne and     
 Redruth.It is a hill,and the name Carn
 Brea is Cornish for 'rocky hill'.It   
 has two historical sites,the castle   
 and the monument.                     
    The earliest record of the castle  
 is when it was used as a chapel in    
 1379.The present building is much     
 larger than the original foundations  
 and the last extension was the South  
 wing built in 1979.It is now used as a
 restaurant.                           
    The monument is a giant cross South
 West of the castle.The foundation     
 stone was laid in June 1836.It was    
 erected in honour of Francis Lord de  
 Dunstanville who was described as "a  
 great and good man,Nobleman,Patriot   
 and a Christian,Philanthropist and    
 adviser of the poor." The Carn is     
 interesting to explore and well worth 
 a visit if you are on holiday.        </content>
