		<title>05TOURISM NEAR BUDE</title>
		<content> The holiday season is shorter in this 
 area than in many other parts of      
 Cornwall.This is partly due to the    
 area's remoteness. The season gets    
 underway at Easter but the main season
 is between June and August. In this   
 area there are 2 main caravan sites-  
 at Maer and Stibb, although farms     
 usually take in tourists as well e.g. 
 Killock Farm has 2 static             
 caravans.Most people come for the     
 unspoilt beaches and countryside.     
    The Maer site is called Bude       
 Holiday Park and has 127{caravans}and 
 several fields for{camping.}The       
 facilities include a club house, shop,
 launderette,swimming pool, and        
 children's play area. The site is 20  
 years old and is located on a private 
 lane which has ramps to slow traffic  
 down.
