		<title>02SCHOOL-HALF A CENTURY BACK</title>
		<content> How different school is now than when 
 I started 50 years ago! Then the      
 Infants were taught in the small room,
 about 6 metres square,now used as an  
 office.The present Hall of the school 
 was then divided into 2 classrooms by 
 a wooden partition. At 9a.m.a bell was
 rung &amp; the children lined up in the   
 playground before marching into school
 Hymns were sung,pupils accompanying on
 the piano.Passages from the Bible &amp;   
 poems were copied out &amp; learnt. Tables
 were learnt by heart &amp; no computers!  
 Punishment was a 100 lines-"I must not
 talk"! There were no school lunches   
 provided,only milk,heated in cold     
 weather,at break time.One coal fire   
 provided our only warmth &amp; there was  
 no running water- the toilets were at 
 the far end of the plyground outside &amp;
 we washed our hands in an enamel bowl 
 in the cloakroom.                     </content>
