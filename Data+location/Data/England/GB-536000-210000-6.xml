		<content>{SQUARE 3712.}                         
{WATER:}The New River was begun in 1609
 as a canal taking the drinking water  
 of Chadwell Springs to London. It runs
 into a pool with 2 islands, each with 
 a memorial stone and one with a willow
 tree. Upstream and downstream are     
 pumping stations which now contain    
 modern machinery but which once housed
 huge beam pumps.                      
{RECREATION:}Part of the area is in the
 Lea Valley Park. There is fishing on  
 the River Lea, the Lea Canal and many 
 gravel pits. This recreational use    
 applies not only to this square but to
 all the others in the grid through    
 which the rivers flow or which have   
 gravel pits or other lakes. There is  
 also a private estate with trout      
 streams and pheasant shooting in its  
 woods.
