		<content>    Before I became a pupil at John    
 Mason School I went to Sutton         
 Courtenay Primary School. The primary 
 school is very near the Sutton        
 Courtenay Study Centre and I have been
 there several times. It is a nature   
 reserve where children of all ages can
 go and study. There is a classroom and
 a large camping area in a field. The  
 centre has 14 hectares of 'wild' land 
 including large areas of hawthorn     
 scrub. We saw a variety of birds from 
 an observation hide including a robin,
 a chaffinch and a blue tit. There is a
 stream and a pond. The pond has       
 several wooden platforms around the   
 edge called dipping points. These were
 made by some fourth year pupils at    
 John Mason School working on a scheme 
 from our Education Authority known as 
 'The New Learning Initiative'
