		<title>11Stanhope Police Station</title>
		<content>     The Police Station is to be found 
 on the Front Street in Stanhope.It is 
 an old building,being built in 1841.  
 Nowadays the Police Station is an     
 unmanned station. However,someone can 
 usually be found between 9 o'clock and
 10 o'clock in the morning, and at     
 lunch-times. Criminals are only locked
 in the cells in an emergency.The      
 Police Station does not have a        
 computer,but the policemen can radio  
 in to the one at Crook.               
    There are eight policemen and one  
 police sergeant based at Stanhope.They
 work entirely in Weardale unless they 
 are needed elsewhere in  an emergency.
 To help them they have three panda    
 cars and a Land Rover which is kept at
 Crook.The police's job at Stanhope is 
 similiar to elsewhere, but in summer  
 they spend quite a lot of time helping
 tourists to the area.                 </content>
