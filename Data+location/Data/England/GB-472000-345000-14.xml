		<title>14Media Flintham/Syerston.</title>
		<content> In 1983 a quarterly{newsletter}was    
 started in Flintham, subsidised by the
 Parish Council. All aspects of village
 life are covered, frequently tongue in
 cheek. The school children illustrate 
 most of the magazine which is a lively
 publication used as an example to     
 other villagers starting their own    
 magazine. Syerston followed Flintham's
 example and started their own smaller 
 scale broadsheet in 1984. There is    
 some light-hearted rivalry between    
 editors!                              
                                       
 Most houses in both villages have TV's
 with a high % of videos and hi-fi     
 sets.                                 
                                       
 The Nottingham Evening Post, a{daily  
{newspaper}and The Newark Advertiser   
 are delivered to both villages.
