    Wheat and barley are grown as the  
 main crop, some of which is sold for  
 cereals the rest being kept for       
 feeding. A small acreage of root      
 crops are grown, for example swedes   
 and mangolds which also help with     
 feeding.                              
    The stock consists of dairy cows   
 and bullocks for fattening. The main  
 breeds are Herefords, Fresians and    
 Charolais.                            
    These two farms are fitted with    
 modern milking equipment.             
    All the farms in this area possess 
 up to date machinery including        
 combined harvesters, tractors, hay    
 machines and bailers.
