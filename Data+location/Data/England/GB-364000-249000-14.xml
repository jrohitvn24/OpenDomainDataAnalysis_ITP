		<content> There is no resident doctor or dentist
 in this block, and people travel to   
 Bromyard where there is a partnership 
 of five doctors with another doctor   
 who works on a part time basis. There 
 are two dentists and two opticians,   
 and a chiropodist in Bromyard.        
 People needing hospital treatment are 
 referred to Hereford or Worcester,    
 those in urgent need of surgery       
 sometimes opting for private treatment
 in the Nuffield Home in Hereford.     
 The Bromyard hospital is now for      
 geriatrics only.  There is a day      
 hospital to which some elderly people 
 are taken twice a week, where they    
 receive physiotherapy, baths, hair-   
 dressing and lunch.  Plans for a new  
 community hospital and elderly peoples
 home in Bromyard have been approved.  
 Schoolchildren have regular medical   
 examinations and by an audiometrician.</content>
