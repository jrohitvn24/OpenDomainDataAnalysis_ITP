		<title>14MOSSLEY CENTENARY FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> Mossley people have never really      
 accepted the fact that after local    
 government re-organisation in 1975    
 they were residents of Tameside. It   
 was the ideal opportunity therefore in
 1985 to demonstrate their independence
 by celebrating the Centenary of the   
 Granting of Mossley's Charter as a    
 Borough in 1885. From 20th April until
 12th May celebrations were held       
 throughout the town in pubs, clubs,   
 churches and homes.                   
  The death of Mr. Robbie Brooks, the  
 Festival President, shortly before the
 Festival was a blow to everyone.      
 Robbie had been the Chairman of the   
 first Festival Committee and such was 
 his stature as President that the     
 Committee has been unable to find     
 anyone suitable to fill the position.
