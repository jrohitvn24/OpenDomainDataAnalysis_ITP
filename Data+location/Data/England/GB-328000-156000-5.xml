		<title>05DANGER OF EROSION FROM SEA</title>
		<content>        THE SANDY RED CLIFF ON THE     
SOUTH SIDE OF THE DOWN,NEAR THE CAFE,IS
RAPIDLY ERODED.THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO   
THE FORCE OF THE SEA AND IT'S LOAD OF  
SAND AND PEPPLES,ALTHOUGH THE          
SCRAMBLING OF POEPLE ON IT FROM RECENT 
 YEARS HAS NOT HELPED.THIS CLIFF WAS   
HIT BADLY DURING THE DECEMBER STORMS OF
1981 AND HAS ERODED VASTLY IN RECENT   
YEARS.SINCE THE STORMS IN 1981 SEA     
DEFENCES(SIMILAR TO THOSE IN BURNHAM), 
HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED.THE EROSION OF   
THE DOWN IS CENTERED ON THIS SANDY     
CLIFF,WHERE THE MAIN LINE OF THE COAST 
MEET THE OUTCROP OF THE DOWN.THE REASON
FOR THIS IS THAT BECAUSE OF IT'S       
POSITION IN THE CORNER THE MAIN POWER  
OF THE WAVES IS CENTERED HERE.THERE IS 
ALSO A LITTLE EROSION AT THE END OF THE
DOWN BY ABRASION.
