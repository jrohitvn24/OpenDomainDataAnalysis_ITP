		<content> The club was formed in 1898 when they 
 played in the New Forest League, at   
 that time they changed in the Rose &amp;  
 Crown Public House and used one of the
 pitches at the tertiary college. In   
 1935 they were elected in the         
 Hampshire County League,which they    
 play in now. Just before the 2nd World
 War the club nearly folded but it was 
 rejuvenated in 1945 and played for a  
 short time in the Bournemouth league  
 before returning to the Hampshire     
 League in 1948.                       
 Their present Grigg Lane pitch was    
 purchased for Â£750 in 1950. The club  
 have had success in recent years,being
 promoted to Hampshire League Division 
 One in 1973 and reaching the last 16  
 of the F.A.Vase in 1976.
