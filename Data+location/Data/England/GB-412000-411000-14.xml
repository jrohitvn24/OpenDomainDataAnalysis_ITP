		<title>14HONLEY HIGH SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   A prominent feature of our 'D block'
 is Honley High School and its grounds.
   The original school building opened 
 its doors to pupils as{Holme Valley   
{Grammar School}in September 1932. The 
 building was designed by H. Wormald.  
   In the 1950s it was considerably    
 extended in the original style by the 
 addition of Geography, Biology and    
 Music classrooms, Dining Room and     
 Kitchens.                             
   In 1973, when with the introduction 
 of comprehensive education the school 
 became{Honley High,}a vast new complex
 of modern buildings was added. These  
 included Sports, Music and Art &amp; Craft
 facilities.                           
   The school, which opened with 480   
 pupils and 14 staff in 1932, has now  
 over 1300 pupils and 80 staff.
