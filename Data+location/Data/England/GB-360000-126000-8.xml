		<content> I woke up late today I came down and  
 mum was making the breakfast. I had my
 breakfast.Before breakfast we had seen
 a Hot-Air-Balloon. It  landed In the  
 field behind Mancroft Farm. The owner 
 said he had to come down because he   
 couldn't see any farther because of   
 the fog.Then we went to Castle Cary   
 in Aunty Audrey's car. We got some    
 sausages and Pineapple in a tin came  
 back and we had some dinner,we had    
 Fish fingers  and Spaggetti. After    
 that we saw 2 Hot-Air-Balloons again. 
 Then I turned on the television  to   
 watch "LIVE AID" I watched it till    
 2.00pm.We then went swimming at       
 Yarlington.Then we had  Bar-b-que     
 after this we cooked the sausages and 
 prepared everythig it started to rain 
 so we sat in the alley-way while Dad  
 cooked the food,I came in and watched 
 "LIVE AID" until I went to bed.       </content>
