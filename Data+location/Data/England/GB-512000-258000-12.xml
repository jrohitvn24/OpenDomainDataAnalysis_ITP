		<content> The majority of agricultural land in  
 the area is arable. The main crops    
 grown are winter wheat, barley and oil
 seed rape. There are a few herds of   
 cattle to be found here, all of which 
 are Herefords. There are also some    
 flocks of sheep, which are kept for   
 their wool. One of the farms also     
 keeps pigs. These pigs are kept in    
 fields like cattle and are not penned 
 up as most pigs are today.
