 over a hundred years.Originally it was
 situated in Clay Street.The new school
 was opened in 1971, and on the day of 
 opening was open from 7.pm _ 9.pm to  
 enable all the village to look around.
   There are 8 classes in the main     
 school and two nursery classes in a   
 mobile building.The children have one 
 year of half days in the nursery and  
 two or three years full time          
 education.                            
   There are 266 infants and 102 in    
 the nursery. Next term there will be  
 a mobile classroom as the numbers     
 of children are going up and up.
