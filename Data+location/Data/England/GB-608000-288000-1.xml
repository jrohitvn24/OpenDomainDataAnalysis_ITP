		<title>01New Buckenham, Carleton Rode</title>
		<content> The two villages of New Buckenham and 
 Carlton Rode stand in a largely       
 intensive arable countryside.  An     
 undulating or flat vista of sugar beet
 and cereals planted in large acreage  
 between low hedge or bare ditch with  
 scattered trees is interspersed with  
 small hamlets.  Here there is more    
 foliage and some meadow land.         
 New Buckenham, a tight knit village   
 with still lively commerce, boasts a  
 slowly increasing population, a       
 rapidly renovating housing stock &amp;    
 completion of the new building infill.
 It lies to the west of its newly      
 levelled recreation ground &amp; large    
 common.  Carleton Rode contrasts, with
 its scattered residential development 
 &amp; lack of any businesses but 1 garage.
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
