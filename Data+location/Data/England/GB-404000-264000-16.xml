		<title>16Swimming Gala.</title>
		<content>  Everyone is excited because today is 
 our {Swimming Gala}.We will be racing 
 against other children with the same  
 colour braids.To get a braid you have 
 to be able to do certain things like{ 
{crawl,backstroke,diving for a brick}  
 and{underwater swimming }.We come to  
 school with our costumes on under our 
 uniform so that we will be ready      
 quickly .Everyone sits along the side 
 of the pool in their braid group.The  
 teacher calls the first race we line  
 up feeling very nervous.Usually       
 someone starts before they should and 
 we have to start again.Ready, steady, 
 go  and we are off the water splashes 
 it seems a long way everyone is       
 cheering for their friend it is       
 very noisy and very exciting.
