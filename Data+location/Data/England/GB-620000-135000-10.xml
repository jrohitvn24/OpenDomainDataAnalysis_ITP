		<title>10 AMUSEMENTS IN FOLKESTONE</title>
		<content>   As Folkestone is a holiday town     
amusements are very popular as tourist 
attractions. The weather cannot be     
trusted so indoor amusements are a good
idea in all seasons. Most amusement    
arcades are situated near the harbour  
and sea front. These amusements are    
often behind shop fronts in small back 
streets. The arcades have bingo, one-  
armed bandits and many electronic      
games. These games usually cost 10p or 
20p.                                   
   There is also a large amusement park
in Folkestone which is on the sea      
front. It is called the Rotunda. The   
main attractions are the bingo halls,  
the Cyclone which is a rollercoaster,  
and the Bounty which swings from side  
to side and you think you will fall    
out. You pay by a disc system. You get 
five discs for one pound and twelve    
discs for two pounds.                  </content>
