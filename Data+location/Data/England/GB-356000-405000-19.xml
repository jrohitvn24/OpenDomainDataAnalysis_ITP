		<title>19MY TOWN - Epilogue</title>
		<content>{ Wigan}is a pretty normal town. The   
{Pier}is the most famous bit and is    
 under redevelopment. They are building
 a museum, a pub and some offices. It  
 should attract a lot of tourism into  
 Wigan especially because of George    
 Orwell. Instead of knocking the{Market
{Hall}down they should stop building   
 multi-storey car parks and use that   
 money to restore it. Replacing the old
 hall with a{concrete monster}is       
 utterly stupid. Something could be    
 done to tidy up the place as there are
 too many derelict buildings.          
  There is not much to do in Wigan for 
 teenagers. We need more youth clubs,  
 discos or new attractions to keep kids
 off the streets. With{unemployment}as 
 bad as it is, there is hardly any     
 point in going to school.You would    
 think that the council would provide  
 more for people to do in the daytime. </content>
