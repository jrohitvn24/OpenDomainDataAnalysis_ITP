 as Chippenham Platt and before that as

 Stroudwater Canal and consists of 8   
 properties including the former parish

 The Willows but is now the William    
 Morris House owned and run by the

 a hostel for mentally retarded people.
                                       
                                       
    NEWTOWN _ consists of 7 properties 
 on the bank of the canal.  These      
 houses used to be on either side of   
 the main road connecting Stroud to the
 M5 Motorway until a recent road       
 improvement scheme by-passed them     
 leaving them in a quiet backwater.
