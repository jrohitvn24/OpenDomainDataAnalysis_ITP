 DIVIDED INTO FAMILY UNITS-BETWEEN     
 50 AND 100 ACRES GROWING A VARIETY OF 
 CROPS TO SPREAD THE WORKLOAD EVENLY   
 THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. SOME FARMS HAVE A

 GLASSHOUSES AND SOLD IN TOWNS AND     
 CITIES.THEN COMES TOMATOES AND        
 CUCUMBERS OR LILLIES.SOME SMALLHOLDERS

 ARE PRODUCED ON THESE SMALL FAMILY    
 FARMS SUCH AS WHEAT BARLEY PEAS ONIONS
 POTATOES AND SUGAR BEET ALSO BULBS AND
 STRAWBERRIES.THERE ARE SOME LARGER    
 FARMS PRODUCING CEREALS AND OILSEED

 REQUIRES BIG FIELDS AND A SMALL LABOUR
