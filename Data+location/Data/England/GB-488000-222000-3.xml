    The crops grown in the fields are  
 winter wheat, hay, wheat and rye      
 grass. The same type of crop is grown 
 in a field for 2 to 3 years and the   
 field is then used to grow a different
 crop. Some of the grass is cut and    
 crimped and made into haylage, which  
 is a cross between silage and hay. It 
 is stored in silos where it ferments  
 and is used for fodder during the     
 winter months when the grass is not   
 growing. Then the cattle are kept in  
 their winter quarters near the milking
 area. The rest of the grass fields are
 pasture for the herd of 200 pedigree  
 Friesian cows and bulls. The cows'    
 manure is kept in a slurry pit and is 
 used to fertilize the fields as       
 necessary.
