		<title>04HOME LIFE - AT 12 YRS OF AGE</title>
		<content> I usually wake up at 6.45 am, get     
 dressed into my uniform and pack my   
 bag. I have my breakfast, cereal or   
 toast. I leave for school at 8.35 am. 
 I am one of the few pupils who walk to
 school, as I live in Northleach and go
 to Westwoods. My Dad is the only      
 teacher who lives in Northleach, so I 
 sometimes walk with him or my friend, 
 Lucy Fulford, though more usually my  
 brother Chris. I am in 1Q, there is   
 also 1P etc. My favourite subjects are
 Art and English. I stay to School     
 lunch and reach home at about 3.45 pm.
 There is always homework but most     
 nights I do something like guides,    
 piano and recorder lessons. I then go 
 to bed at 9.15 pm.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
