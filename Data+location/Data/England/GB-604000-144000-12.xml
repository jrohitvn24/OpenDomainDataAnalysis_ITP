 Brook Church is a small Norman Church.
  It was built in the eleventh century 
 by the monks of Christchurch in       
 Canterbury.  It has avery big square  
 tower with three bells.  It has one   
 decorated window and two early English
 one.  The rest of the windows are     
 Norman.  The most famous thing in the 
 church is the wall paintings.  People 
 come from other countries to look at  
 those.  The ones in the chancel are   
 done in black on white or white on    
 black. In one wall of the chancel     
 there is a squint, which is a hole in 
 the wall with a little door over it.  
 In Norman times a hermit probably had 
 a little hut outside this and he      
 could look through and watch the      
 service.
