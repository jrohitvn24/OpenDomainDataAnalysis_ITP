		<content> Rothbury attracts a lot of visitors   
 during summertime. They flock to the  
 riverside where I live and            
 unfortunately, many of them leave     
 litter behind. This upsets the        
 residents because they try to keep the
 place tidy.  All the shops seem to    
 become overcrowded and it is difficult
 to find a parking space in the main   
 street. There are two toy shops which 
 I like to visit and a newsagents which
 also sells toys. It is very busy in   
 the summer because it sells sweets,   
 books, cards, etc. There are not      
 enough parking spaces for cars in the 
 main street so they end up in the side
 streets, causing a lot of congestion. 
 I think that some local people feel   
 better when the streets are not so    
 overcrowded.
