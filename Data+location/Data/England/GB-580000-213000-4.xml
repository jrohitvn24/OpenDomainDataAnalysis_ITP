		<title>04THE LIBRARY, WITHAM.</title>
		<content>  The Library is in Newland St. It     
 moved there from Maldon Rd. in 1981   
 because the old building was too small
 . They have 66,850 books!It is housed 
 in a 200 yr old house that at one time
 was a Post office,then a school.In    
 1925 it was changed into a cinema ,now
 it is a library.It is very attractive.
 The front is Georgian and inside it is
 modern because they didn't want to    
 change the outside.                   
  As well as books they have videos and
 records. They will put up posters in  
 the entrance hall. Down stairs there  
 are childrens books and fiction books.
 There aretables to sit and read at.In 
 the holiday they have Book Train for  
 children who like reading so they can 
 enter competitions.Upstairs are the   
 local directories and other reference 
 books.They use light pens that they   
 pass over the ticket and the book.    </content>
