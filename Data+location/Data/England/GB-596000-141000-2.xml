		<title>02At the Shopping Centre</title>
		<content> Besides one out of town supermarket,  
 there is a small shopping centre to   
 serve a densely populated residential 
 area.The shops in the centre are small
 units providing a limited range of    
 retail variety.The newsagents is a    
 very helpful shop.After school is the 
 busiest time of the day.You can buy   
 magazines and sweets.There is a       
 selection of games.I like the birthday
 cards and there are some books,records
 and pads of paper.There is also a     
 little post office.The post office    
 will pay your family allowance and if 
 you are unemployed,your unemployment  
 benefit money.You can also get stamps 
 and they have a bank for children to  
 keep their savings in.The fish and    
 chip shop is very handy if you do not 
 want to cook at night.
