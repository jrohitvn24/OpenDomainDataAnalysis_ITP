		<content> Mainly farmland, the area is threaded 
 with country roads amd public foot-   
 paths providing many pleasant walks.  
 Previous use of sprays has meant the  
 loss of rare wildflowers, but present 
 thoughtful council maintenance of road
 side verges has re-established many   
 commoner species. Fox coverts, spin-  
 neys and stands of trees on field     
 slopes make attractive landmarks; and 
 hadgerow trees of oak and ash are     
 common and increasing under local     
 policy. Weather conditions and temp-  
 eratures are rarely extreme. The river
 Sow, in places edged with alder and   
 willow, flows through{Copmere,}a 45   
 acre ice-age lake fringed by reeds    
 and woodland. There are other private 
 pools including Castlemere which forms
 part of a Nature Reserve leased to the
{Staffordshire Conservation Trust.
