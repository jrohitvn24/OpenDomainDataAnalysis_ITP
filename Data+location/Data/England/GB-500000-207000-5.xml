		<title>05POTTEN END-THE NURSERY II.</title>
		<content> ALTHOUGH THE NURSERY SELLS MOSTLY     
 PLANTS,THEY HAVE SOME ANIMALS AS      
 WELL,THEY ONLY SELL THEM TO THE       
 PUBLIC. THE ANIMALS THEY HAVE ARE     
 THIRTY HENS AND COCKERELS.            
                                       
 THE HENS LAY ROUGHLY THREE DOZEN SMALL
 EGGS EACH WEEK.                       
                                       
 ONLY A FEW OF THE CHICKENS ARE SOLD   
 AND THERE ARE SIX  ADULT DUCKS AND SIX
 DUCKLINGS.                            
                                       
 THE DUCKS DO NOT LAY ANY EGGS,AND THEY
 ARE NOT SOLD,SO THEY ARE KEPT TO ROAM 
 AROUND THE NURSERY.                   
                                       
 DURING THE NIGHT THE DUCKS,HENS AND   
 COCKERELS HAVE TO STAY IN A SHED,     
 BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF FOXES EATING 
 THEM.                                 
                                       </content>
