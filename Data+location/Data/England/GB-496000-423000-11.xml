		<title>11ECOLOGY IN N.FERRIBY.</title>
		<content> North Ferriby has a public house      
 called,'The Duke of Cumberland'       
 Some people would like another one    
 because there isn't enough room.We    
 have one fish and chip shop but people
 would like a Chinese takeaway.        
   There is a conflict between those   
 who wish to 'develope'the village and 
 those who wish to 'conserve' it.      
   Some residents object to the smell  
 and noise of the local smelting works 
 called,'Capper Pass' particularly as  
 its chimney dominates the skyline.    
 Others object to the smell of the     
 local pig  breeding unit.             
   The danger is that in pursuit of    
 more amenities and facilities, e.g.   
 public toilets,the original simple    
 village atmosphere will be swamped by 
 a more sophisticated life style.
