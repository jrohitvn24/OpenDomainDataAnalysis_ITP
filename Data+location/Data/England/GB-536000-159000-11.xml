		<title>11Life in New Addington</title>
		<content>I asked my dad what he thought about   
livng in New Addington.He said that it 
was like living in a blind alley.Then I
asked what the good things were "its   
next to the country" he said."what are 
the bad things"I asked.He said "there  
was a lack of amenities.I asked him  if
he would like to live somewhere else.He
said yes he would like to live         
somewhere else. He is a fireman. Then I
asked my dads girlfriend what she      
thought about living in New Addington. 
She said that she didn't like to think 
about it.Then I asked her what the good
things were and she said the same as my
dad that it is near the country.Then I 
asked her what the bad things were.She 
said there were more bad points than   
good points.She would like to live     
somewhere else as well.She is a short- 
hand typist.
