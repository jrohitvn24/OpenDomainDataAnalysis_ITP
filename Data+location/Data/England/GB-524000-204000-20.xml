		<title>20Who we are at Brookmans Pk.</title>
		<content>    All the research and writing was   
 done by the two fourth year junior    
 classes at Brookmans Park Primary     
 School.We did not have as much time as
 we would have liked as we went to     
 Paris on a school trip in June and a  
 lot of this term was spent doing work 
 on that.                              
    We did several questionnaires which
 we sent out to people in the village. 
 We were surprised at how few people   
 bothered to return them. It was just  
 over half of those we sent out.We     
 enjoyed making up questions and also  
 counting the answers when they came   
 in. We went around interviewing people
 in the area and found out it was not  
 as easy as we thought. They were very 
 kind and helpful and gave us some     
 useful information.
