		<title>15LOCAL FETES IN CHESHIRE.</title>
		<content> Most villages in Cheshire hold annual 
 Fetes and Carnivals, usually in May or
 June. I will describe the Comberbach  
 Village Fete which is a very typical  
 example. The main event is the        
 crowning of the Rose Queen (or        
 Carnival Queen), attended by her      
 Attendants, Page boys, and Flower     
 girls. Entertainment is provided for  
 children, parents and Senior Citizens.
 There are Donkey rides, Bran Tubs, and
 all the usual stalls. Local clubs,    
 organizations and playgroups prepare  
 floats which are driven in procession 
 and then judged. Each year has a      
 different theme. This year's theme for
 Comberbach was the Circus. Of course, 
 organizing a Fete takes a great deal  
 of time and work and each village has 
 a committee which begins its plans    
 early in the year. The same committee 
 often organizes Bonfire Nights.       </content>
