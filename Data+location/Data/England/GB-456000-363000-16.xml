		<content>  Local farms set amidst the rolling   
 countryside are positioned near the   
 valley, sheltered by copses. They are 
 remnants of the former "Dukeries".    
 Many old farm buildings date back to  
 that era.                             
  The large fields contain mainly      
 crops. Although on Warren Farm at     
 least there are sheep and bovines     
 raised for meat.                      
  Within the coniferous plantations    
 there remain some of the old oaks of  
 the former extensive Sherwood forest. 
 Some of these are named in particular 
 Parliament and Old Churn Oak.         
  A feature of the area surrounding    
 Clipstone is the ease of access to the
 countryside. With the many forestry   
 roads and the criss-crossing of old   
 tracks, the landscape is available to 
 all.
