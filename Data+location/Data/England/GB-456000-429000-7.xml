		<title>07WATER SUPPLY</title>
		<content> On Brayton Barff,a small hill to the  
 west of Selby,there is a storage      
 reservoir owned by the Yorkshire Water
 Authority. The reservoir was built    
 here because this is the highest point
 in the area and water will flow to the
 customers under the force of gravity  
 so that no pumping is needed.         
 The original reservoir was built in   
 1906 and held 800,000 gallons of      
 water. The new one was built in 1968  
 and holds 5 million gallons. This is  
 only enough for half a day's supply.  
 When the reservoir overflows the      
 excess water is supposed to flow into 
 Selby Dam,a nearby stream,but it often
 floods the surrounding fields.        
 The Y.W.A. are thinking about         
 demolishing the old brick pumphouse as
 it has suffered from vandalism in     
 recent years. The new electric pump is
 housed in a much smaller building.    </content>
