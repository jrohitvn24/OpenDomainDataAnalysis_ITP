		<title>18ORCHARDS IN THE TOAT AREA</title>
		<content>  South of the Toat Monument lies      
 Tullens Toat, an apple orchard of some
 130 acres. This is one of four        
 orchards in this area, the others     
 being smaller, between 15 and 25 acres
 each. Most of the trees are the       
 original Cox's Orange Pippin variety. 
  In 1985 the owner of Tullens Toat was
 awarded the Elgar Memorial Bowl for   
 the outstanding orchard in the South  
 of England. The apples are sold either
 direct to the public or marketed      
 through a cooperative fruit society.  
  Strawberries and raspberries are also
 grown. Tullens Toat operate pick your 
 own sales but the smaller Poplar Fruit
 Farm specialises in early and late    
 crops and supplies direct to a famous 
 London store.                         
  The owner of Poplar is proud that he 
 owns his 15 acres whereas his father  
 and grandfather were farm employees.  </content>
