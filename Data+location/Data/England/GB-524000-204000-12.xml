		<title>12Adult's day at Brookmans Pk</title>
		<content>    I am the headteacher at Brookmans  
 Park Primary School.The majority of   
 the children come from the village    
 itself and number about 250.          
    I am up at 6.30a.m. as I like to   
 have an unhurried breakfast with my   
 wife.My yougest daughter who is 18    
 works in London and leaves the house  
 to catch the train at about 7.30a.m.  
 I leave at about 8a.m. and my journey 
 takes only about 10 minutes by car. My
 wife leaves for work in north London  
 at about the same time. As there is no
 convenient public transport we have to
 have two cars so this is a very expen-
 sive item in our budget.              
    Much of my day seems to involve    
 dealing with problems which are       
 peripheral to education.i.e. contract 
 cleaning:school meals:building maint- 
 enance.I usually get home about       
 5.45p.m. and do some gardening or DIY.</content>
