		<content> Pre-school children play games related
to their experience-Mothers &amp; Fathers, 
Doctors &amp; Nurses,Tea Parties-these can 
be played by as few  as 2 children.    
 Playground games vary in name but     
main-ly appear to be games an almost   
unlimited number of children can play. 
DRAC &amp; BULLDOG are variations of the   
old "Hide &amp; Seek". In Drac the seeker  
(Drac) has a laser beam which he points
at the person found who then turns into
a Zombie.The game finishes when all are
caught.                                
 In Bulldog the seeker has to say      
"Bulldog 1,2,3 when a person is caught.
That person becomes a seeker too and   
the game finishes when all are caught. 
 "44" is slightly different in that if 
the seeker is away from base all those 
already caught can be released by a    
free child calling "44 Save All".      
 Computer Games &amp; Football are popular.</content>
