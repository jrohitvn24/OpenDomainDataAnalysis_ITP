		<title>13Chesfield park and church</title>
		<content> ...As we entered{Chesfield Park}we    
 were greeted by Rosie the labrador,and
 her puppy.New trees have been planted 
 in the woodland round the edge of the 
 estate and in fields,one replacing a  
 tree struck by lightning.The young    
 ones have wire around them for        
 protection from grazing creatures like
 the horses and cattle whose owners    
 rent the fields here.There were old   
 tyres resting against the fence for   
 horse jumps.The bullocks followed us  
 and many flies followed them.We saw   
 the house,but not close to.           
    We walked through{Manor Farm},a    
 riding school for the disabled,and we 
 saw the ruins of{Chesfield Church}.It 
 was built in 1280,you can see the     
 shape it was and where the walls      
 were.They were two feet four inches   
 thick.No-one knows why{Chesfield      
{village}disappeared.                  </content>
