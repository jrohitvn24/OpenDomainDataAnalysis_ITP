		<content> I am the Parish Priest of             
 Walsingham;my name is{John Barnes.}I  
 teach the Christian faith,celebrate   
 the sacraments of the church,and care 
 for God's people in this village as my
 predecessors have done for a          
 thousand years.Our Parish Church,{    
{St.Mary's,}stands on its ancient      
 site.In the course of the centuries it
 has been rebuilt and extended,and 20  
 years ago it was{gutted by fire.}     
 Splendidly rebuilt,it stands as God's 
 presence in the midst of his          
 people.There are two other churches in
 this Parish,{St.Peters}at             
 Gt.Walsingham,and{St.Giles}at         
 Houghton.On Sundays the Eucharist is  
 offered in each of them,and about one 
 hundred people in all are present at  
 the three Altars.In the               
 Summer,pilgrims to the Shrine at      
 Walsingham join in our worship.       </content>
