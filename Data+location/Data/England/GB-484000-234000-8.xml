		<content>   There are lots of different types of
 houses in West Bletchley.Most people  
 in our school live in semi-detached   
 houses.There are also terraced houses,
 flats,maisonettes and there is one    
 tower block of 21 storeys. Most       
 houses have central heating and       
 gas fires.Very few people have open   
 fires.Most houses also have garages   
 and gardens.Most people are buying    
 their own houses.                     
   The houses in Coffee Hall are       
 built from white breeze blocks.They   
 are terraced houses which had flat    
 roofs,but this led to leaking so now  
 they have pitched roofs.The houses at 
 Beanhill and Netherfield are both made
 of corrugated materials.Beanhill      
 houses are bungalows and in           
 Netherfield the houses can be 1,2 or 3
 storeys high and are built in long    
 terraces of 50-60 houses.             </content>
