		<title>02An overview of local farming</title>
		<content> The area is primarily agricultural in 
 character and supports eleven farms.  
 Most of the land is pasture and meadow
 with a few fields of barley and       
 turnips grown for animal feeding.     
 Though there is still some rough      
 grazing, the cultivation of selected, 
 nutritious grass has improved the     
 quality of the herbage. The grass crop
 is stored as both hay and silage.     
{Herds of British Friesian cattle}are  
 the commonest dairy cows. There are   
 also dairy Shorthorn cattle. The Welsh
 Black is a popular choice for beef    
 cattle.                               
{Sheep}are widespread over the area,   
 with Suffolk Sheep the commonest      
 breed. There are also some British    
 Milk sheep.
