		<content>  We asked people if they liked living 
 in the country.All except four people 
 said yes,they did.                    
   We asked why and the main reasons   
 were (a)it is quiet                   
      (b)people are friendly           
      (c)a good social life            
      (d)beautiful countryside in easy 
         reach of big towns.           
   2 people said they did not like     
 living in the country becauseit was   
 too quiet.                            
   2 people said they did not know     
 whether they liked it or not.         
   We asked people if they went to     
 church or chapel and more than 70%    
 said yes,but we do not think they all 
 go regularly because the congregation 
 is not very big except at Christmas.
