		<content>   Most households in Sapperton have a 
 car (49 out of 66) which is as just as
 well because the bus service is not   
 very frequent. Three times each       
 weekday a single decker bus comes     
 through from Stroud to Cirencester at 
 2 hourly intervals and returns to     
 Stroud at 10.30,12.30 and 14.30. 37   
 people did their weekly 'big-shop' in 
 Cirencester, 2 went to Stroud and 6   
 older residents depended entirely on  
 Pete Strange's Mobile Shop which      
 visits the Village on Wednesdays and  
 Saturdays.We could only question 45   
 people. 38 use their cars to leave the
 Village, 5 go on the bus and 2 have   
 motor bikes.
