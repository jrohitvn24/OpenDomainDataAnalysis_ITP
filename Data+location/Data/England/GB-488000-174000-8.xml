		<content> The school was built in 1857 and Queen
 Victoria gave Â£100 towards the cost of
 it.65{children of 5-9 years of age}go 
 to the school and when they leave most
 of them attend schools in Windsor.    
 There are three classes,four teachers,
 one helper and one welfare assistant. 
 School starts at 8.55am and ends at   
 3.15pm. Most of the pupils travel to  
 school by car as they live in Fifield,
 Bray and Oakley Green.The new wooden  
 church which was built nearby is now  
 used as the school hall.The mortuary  
 chapel which adjoins the school has   
 now been deconsecrated so that extra  
 space will be provided.All the pupils 
 have lunch at school and there is a   
 detached cafeteria.This room is also  
 used for gymnastics and showing films.
 The uniform is green,white and grey.  
 There is a playground and field and a 
 swimming pool heated by solar panels. </content>
