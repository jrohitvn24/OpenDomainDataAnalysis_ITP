		<title>10THE CRICKET PITCH AND TEAM.</title>
		<content>   As long ago as can be remembered    
 there has been a{cricket field}in     
 Michaelchurch Escley, beside the road 
 between the Post Office and the       
 church.Unfortunantly many years ago   
 this area was{ploughed up}and the     
 village team lost their home pitch.   
     The local men,in order to play    
 cricket,had to travel six miles to    
{Peterchurch.}                         
      In 1984 a decision to move back  
 to the village was taken.The local    
 landowner was contacted and he agreed 
 to hand back{the original site}of the 
 cricket field.                        
       This season the team have had   
 fixtures every Sunday.Away matches    
 take them as far away as thirty miles.
