		<content> The{present building}was erected in   
 1846. First of all, it was a{private  
{house.}In 1947, the{Shaftesbury       
{Society }opened it as a school for the
 physically handicapped. At first, it  
 was girls only,but then boys joined   
 as well. Stables were converted into  
 chapel, hydrotherapy pool and         
 physiotherapy room. Classrooms and    
 dormitries were built on.{Today,}there
 are 25 pupils aged between 11 to 16   
 years. The lake has been cleared and  
 stocked with fish. A new greenhouse   
 and garden area was built. Plans have 
 been made for new field studies and   
 leisure centre called{Abbey Leaze.    
 This will be use for groups of able   
 bodied and disabled to enjoy the      
 school grounds and local area. In our 
 grounds, we have woodland, lawns and  
 water, which encourages wildlife that 
 we can observe.                       </content>
