		<title>11GAMES PEOPLE PLAY</title>
		<content>    Games are fun,most games are a bit 
tiring.There are many different games, 
some played indoors,some outside;some  
are best played on grass others can be 
played on a hard surface.In some games 
people can get hurt like rugby,football
and hockey.In most games outside you   
use a ball.In netball you have to throw
a big,light ball through a hoop stuck  
to a pole in the air.In hockey you hit 
a small ball through two posts called  
goalposts with a banana shaped stick.In
rounders you try to hit a small ball   
which somebody throws at you,with a    
thin round bat as far as you can and   
then you run round four posts to score 
a point.You can be out if someone      
catches the ball before it hits the    
ground or if the ball is thrown to a   
post and gets there before you do.We   
play all these games at school as well
