		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF DEONNE TANNER(11)
  The radio comes on at precisely 0700.
 The song which is playing is Duran    
 Duran's "View to a Kill."I give myself
 ten minutes to wake up and then I get 
 dressed. I go to the bathroom to wash 
 and clean my teeth and then I have my 
 breakfast. I usually have cereal.After
 breakfast I pack my bag and put in my 
 lunch: sandwiches, crisps, chocolate  
 biscuits and a drink.I kiss my parents
 goodbye and go next door for my friend
 Joanne.As I ring the bell, Lucky, Lady
 and Snoopy, her pups, come rushing to 
 the door. Jacqueline, Joanne's sister,
 answers and calls Joanne. Once at     
 school, we start KMP which is a maths 
 project. At 1520 I go home for dinner 
 and at 1800 it is time to go to       
 gymnastics with my friend, Kellie. We 
 go home at 2000 and I wash for bed.
