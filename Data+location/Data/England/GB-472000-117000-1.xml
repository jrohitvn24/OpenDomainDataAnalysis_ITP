		<title>01Rural Downland South Buriton</title>
		<content> This area has remained rural, though  
 there have been changes in farming,   
 housing and industry. There are 21    
 widely scattered dwellings, only two  
 of which have been built since 1950.  
 These originally housed farm and      
 forestry workers or employees of      
 Ditcham Estate. A few still do, but   
 most are owned by people who work     
 elsewhere. There is no public         
 transport, so all drive to work. There
 are 2 small works, Buriton Saw Mills &amp;
 Circuit Engineering. Both are sited in
 disused quarries, relics of the large 
 lime works. A HCC tip utilises another
 quarry and it was feared that this    
 would spread to a pit nearer Buriton. 
 Crossing the area on the ridge is the 
 South Downs Way which follows an      
 ancient trackway. The Queen Elizabeth 
 Park caters for countryside pursuits  
 receiving \ million visitors a year.  </content>
