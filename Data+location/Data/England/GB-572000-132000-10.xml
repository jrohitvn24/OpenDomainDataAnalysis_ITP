		<title>10FARMING IN BEDGEBURY AREA</title>
		<content>   Farming in the High Weald is not    
 easy or high-yielding.  The reason is 
 partly low-fertility soil derived from
 sand rock and partly the banks and    
 gullies left by water erosion.  The   
 area is made beautiful by oaks and    
 beeches which denote deep well drained
 earth;  unfortunately the good places 
 are patchy and this does not make for 
 fields of evenly growing crops.       
   There has always been dairying but  
 it is declining due to over-supply of 
 milk in Europe.  Sheep have largely   
 replaced cows: the resulting well kept
 hedges and fences are good to see.    
   Traditionally hops have been        
 important in the area, growing well in
 the sheltered valleys.  Now, however, 
 rationalisation of the industry has   
 made many small oasthouses redundant, 
 some being converted into homes which 
 happily retain the unique cowls.      </content>
