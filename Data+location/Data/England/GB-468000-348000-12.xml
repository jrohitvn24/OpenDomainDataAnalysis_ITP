		<title>12BLEASBY C.E.PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> This school has 75 pupils aged 4+ to  
 11 from the villages of{Bleasby,      
{Hoveringham  and Thurgarton.}It is    
 housed in a 1962/72 single storey     
 building with a flat roof and hanging 
 tiles on a steel and breeze block     
 frame.It has a large field in an      
 attractive setting.                   
 Numeracy and literacy, especially the 
 latter, are still central to the      
 curriculum but arts and crafts,music, 
 science,P.E. and games,drama and more 
 are also important-in their own right 
 and as facilitators of literacy and   
 personal development.This last factor 
 of individual growth is of such over- 
 riding importance that the use of     
 authority is kept to a minimum and an 
 informal,family atmosphere is routine.
 At eleven years of age the children   
 transfer to The Minster Comprehensive 
 School at{Southwell.                  </content>
