		<title>18Black Cherry Fair</title>
		<content> Today, there is a market held on      
 Saturdays in Windsor Street. It has   
 about six stalls. It used to be more  
 important as rights to hold markets   
 have been held from the time of the   
 Abbey. These suffered  various        
 interuptions e.g. Wars of the Roses   
 and moved in the days of the week.    
 Chertsey had various fairs which      
 included the "Onion Fair", held on    
 Holy Cross Day and the "Black Cherry  
 Fair" held on St. Ann's Hill on the   
 26th July. A wide variety of goods    
 were traded.                          
  The "Black Cherry Fair" has been     
 revived in the past 5 years. It takes 
 place at Abbey Fields in July. It is  
 opened by a procession of floats      
 through Chertsey. During the fair     
 there is a fancy dress competition and
 a dog show.
