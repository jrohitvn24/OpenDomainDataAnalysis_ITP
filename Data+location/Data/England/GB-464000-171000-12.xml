		<content>   Young people like to be the same    
 as other young people.However,peer    
 group pressure today is probably      
 stronger than it has ever been.       
   There is growing concern amongst    
 Calcot/Tilehurst parents about 'glue- 
 sniffing'.Secondary teachers keep a   
 look out for young people who have a  
 red mark beneath the nose.Though drugs
 and drug abuse is causing concern at  
 a national level,Calcot and Tilehurst 
 do not have a significant problem.    
   The most talked about 'sub-culture' 
 today is that of the 'punks'.These    
 young people have spikey hair-styles, 
 which stand straight up from their    
 heads.Many older people are quite     
 alarmed when meeting 'punks' in the   
 street and often fear them.           
   Special types of get together for   
 dancing,called discos,are very popular
 with younger and older people.        </content>
