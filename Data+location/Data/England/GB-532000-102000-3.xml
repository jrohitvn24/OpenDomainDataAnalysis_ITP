		<title>03KEMP TOWN HOUSING</title>
		<content>       The Kemp Town area mainly       
 consists of high density terraced     
 housing. Although the area contains   
 many of the commonly found C20th      
 buildings, its main character &amp;       
 identity lies in its{C19th}houses.    
 Many are built in the classical mode  
 of brick with stone dressings &amp; iron  
 railings. Some houses are however     
 faced with Mathematical tiles, a      
 characteristic of the county. Many of 
 the streets are quite narrow &amp; few of 
 the houses have gardens, though some  
 have roof gardens.                    
       Many of the older houses have   
 mews behind them which have often been
 converted to holiday homes. The       
 Edwardian houses however don't have   
 mews. Some have garages, particularly 
 the houses surrounding Queens Park.   
 Most of the seafront consists just of 
 listed buildings.                     </content>
