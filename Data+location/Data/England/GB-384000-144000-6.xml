		<title>06TOURISM IN WARMINSTER</title>
		<content>   Warminster's historic and beautiful 
 setting attracts many tourists. But   
 with a new by-pass soon to be built   
 around Warminster, tourists might just
 drive straight past the town,         
 affecting local employment. So a      
 special Committee for the Promotion   
 of Warminster has been set up. The 20 
 Committee members  are Councillors,   
 traders and other volunteers who meet 
 monthly to think up ideas. The Town   
 Council gives money and other help.   
   Already they have moved the Tourist 
 Information Office to the new Library,
 rewritten the Town Guide, designed new
 Tourist Leaflets and set up a Nature  
 Walk. Along the by-pass, signs will   
 tell tourists about Warminster.       
   Committee Chairman, former Mayor Mr 
 Tony Duke, believes that in the end   
 the by-pass will make Warminster a    
 more attractive place for tourists.   </content>
