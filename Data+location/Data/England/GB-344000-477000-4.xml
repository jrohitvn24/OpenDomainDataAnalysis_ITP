 Although now a crumbling ruin, Arnside
 Tower is the oldest building in the   
 area. Its date is not known but there 
 is a recorded to reference to its     
 existence in 1517 although it is      
 probably much older than that. It was 
 badly damaged by fire in 1602 and has 
 remained a ruin ever since. It was    
 built like a border pele tower with a 
 base some 15m square with an          
 impressive turret and spiral stairway.
 It commanded an strong position and   
 would have been easy to defend had the
 need arisen.
