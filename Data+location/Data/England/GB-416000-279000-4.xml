   I used to live in a small village   
 called Butlers Marston near Stratford 
 upon Avon. My dad is a sales          
 representative for a large computer   
 company with an area of about 200     
 square miles in the Midlands.         
   We decided to move to Solihull to be
 more central for my dads job. We liked
 this part of the town because there is
 a lot of new houses being built on the
 edge of the green belt, so it still   
 feels like living in the country. The 
 new roads like the by-pass, the M42   
 and M6 means that travelling is much  
 easier for my dad.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
