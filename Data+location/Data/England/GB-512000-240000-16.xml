		<title>16SERVICES IN SOUTHILL</title>
		<content> In Southill there are lots of useful  
 services.One of these services is the 
 village store which looks rather like 
 an old house ,but it sells just about 
 everything a middle size store would, 
 because it has to cope with people who
 can't get out to the town .Other      
 services include buses,post and milk  
 rounds.The buses go through and stop  
 at the memorial in Southill quite     
 regularly.There are three post        
 boxes in Southill and one telephone   
 box.In Southill very few police which 
 go through the village,There is about 
 one patrol car which goes through     
 Southill every seven days.Southill has
 one pub,The White Horse and is in     
 good business most of the time while  
 it is open to the public.In Southill  
 there is one church, a  chapel and one
 scout and general meeting  hut.
