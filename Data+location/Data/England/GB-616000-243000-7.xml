		<title>07Games we play at school.</title>
		<content> Most schools have three playtimes, in 
which you can go outside and play games
like marbles, sausages, elastics,etc.  
Our class mostly plays sausages and the
boys always chase the girls.There are  
two more games, but we do not play with
the boys.They are elastics for the     
girls and football for the boys.We play
elastics by tying a piece of elastic   
together then jumping over it.We have a
rymne to go with our jumping, we say   
England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales,     
inside, outside, inside, scales.
