 Today is Monday.I got ready for school
 and had my breakfast.For the last few 
 minutes I turned the T.V. on and      
 watched T.V.a.m.I saw the weather     
 report.It said fine for the rest of   
 the day.When I got to school everybody
 was talking about the motorway.When   
 the whistle was blown everybody lined 
 up.We went in class and did maths.When
 playtime came we had to stay in       
 because it was raining.After play we  
 did English.When 3.30 came we all went
 home.                                 
 My friend Shelley came to call for me 
 and we went down the playing fields.  
 When I came in I spent most of the    
 evening watching T.V.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
