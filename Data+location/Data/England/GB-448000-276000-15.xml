		<content> Newbold Avon is a{middle}school with  
 nearly 200 pupils aged beetween 8 and 
 12 years.It became a middle school in 
 1970 following{reorganisation.        
  There are 8{classrooms}in the main   
 building with a large hall and dining 
 room.A{unit}is situated near to the   
 school with facilities for craft and  
 science.                              
 Newbold Grange secondary school is on 
 the same site and most of the pupils{ 
{transfer}to this school when they are 
 12.Other schools which children leave 
 for are Harris, Ashlawn, Rugby High   
 school and Lawrence Sheriff.          
 The school has a very good{tradition} 
 in cross country running, and the{    
{choir}are building up an excellent    
 reputation.Unfortunately the number of
 children in the school is decreasing  
 because of the falling birth rate in  
 the village.                          </content>
