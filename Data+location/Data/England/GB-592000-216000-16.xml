		<title>16A DERELICT COTTAGE</title>
		<content> In Lower Road, Layer Breton, on the   
 edge of the farmyard of St.           
 Catherine's Hall Farm, stands a very  
 old cottage. This is the oldest       
 cottage in Layer Breton. It was last  
 lived in in the 1960's and since then 
 has unfortunately fallen into a bad   
 state of disrepair. During a storm the
 brick chimney stack fell through the  
 roof and no repairs were made.        
 Consequently the whole roof at the    
 eastern end has collapsed. It is      
 possible to see clearly the Tudor     
 style oak framing and the wattle and  
 daub which was used for filling. This 
 was made of horse_hair, twigs, horse  
 manure, cow dung and mud. The outside 
 would have been white_washed.         
 There is a preservation order on the  
 building and hopefully it is soon to  
 be restored to its original condition.
