		<title>20Housing at Sutton-at-Hone</title>
		<content>  This area is completely separate from
Swanley,most of the building was done  
in the 1930s and 1950s.There were more 
flats and maisonettes than in the other
areas we surveyed.The houses are very  
mixed,from the small Victorian terrace 
to the large modern houses and         
bungalows.                             
  1 house had a moat all around it and 
was very big.The little terrace houses 
had gardens and there were some shops  
built in 1930.                         
                                       
                                       
   This work has been done by the top  
   Infants and Junior children at      
   Birchwood C.P. School               
   Swanley.
