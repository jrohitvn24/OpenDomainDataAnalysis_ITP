		<title>08FARMING, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>    Agriculture in this block is       
 predominantly arable, although one    
 farm specializes in milk production.  
 Specialization, whether of crops or   
 stock, is affected by E.E.C. policy   
 and the subsidies available.          
    Most farms are 250 - 300 acres, but
 many are worked as part of a larger   
 unit, consisting of several farms,    
 sometimes adjacent, but sometimes     
 widely spread. Several farms in this  
 block were parts of larger units whose
 land lay outside the block.           
    Soils varied cosiderably, from     
 thin, flinty soil on chalk in the     
 east, to heavy clay interspersed with 
 patches of sand on the lower land to  
 the west.                             
    All farms had heavy investment in  
 machinery, though they relied on      
 contractors for some specialised      
 crops,such as peas.                   </content>
