		<content>  A three tier education system exists 
 in Grimethorpe and the surrounding    
 area-Shafton, Brierley and Cudworth.  
 There are four 5-9yrs. and three      
 5-10yrs. first schools, two 9-13yrs.  
 and one 10-13yrs. middle school and   
 one 13-18yrs. high school.There are   
 good links between first-middle-and   
 high school to ensure good continuity 
 and progression throughout the        
 comprehensive system.                 
  The schools in Grimethorpe have the  
 support of parent groups to raise     
 money for extra equipment and to      
 purchase and maintain mini-buses.     
  Milefield Middle and Springvale      
 Middle Schools have strong links with 
 Lille in N.France.Exchanges are made  
 with primary schools and with Lille   
 University Sports Club to play rugby.
