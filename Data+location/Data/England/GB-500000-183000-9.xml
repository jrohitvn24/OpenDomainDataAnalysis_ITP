 When I went to Black Park I took my   
 football and my toy electric boat to  
 run in the lake.When  we got to the   
 lake we put the battery into the      
 boat,moved the rudder and off it      
 went.The problem was that it stopped  
 in the middle of the lake,so we had to
 ask a person to turn it back for      
 me.Later we put the rudder to the far 
 left so it would go around in circles 
 and it would come back.This time some 
 water got into the engine,so then we  
 went into a field,which had some trees
 which I could climb.I went from tree  
 to tree 3 times.Soon we had to go     
 because our dinner was be ready.
