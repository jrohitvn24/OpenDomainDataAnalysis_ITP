		<title>11DAY CARE CENTRE S.SHIELDS</title>
		<content> There is a Day Care Centre in         
 Gainsborough Avenue, near our         
 school.It is an old people's club,run 
 by the Social Service Department.It   
 has 100 members, most of whom attend  
 for two sessions each week.It opens at
 7am and closes at 3pm,but it also has 
 2 evening sessions which are run by   
 the members themselves.               
 Most off the old people pay 55p and   
 have their lunch there.The cook is not
 allowed to use convenience foods,     
 everything must be fresh.Some of the  
 men come in everyday for lunch,       
 because they do not know how to cook  
 for themselves.                       
 After lunch, the old people play 5 or 
 10 or 15 games of bingo.They love it. 
 The centre tries to provide a variety 
 of activities,such as darts, dancing, 
 whistand handicrafts.They even go on  
 holiday 3 times a year.               </content>
