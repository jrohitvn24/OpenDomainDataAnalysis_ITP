		<content>   At school we have a football team in
 the winter and cricket team in the    
 summer.  In football you have to kick 
 a ball between two posts for a goal.  
 The team who scores the most goals    
 wins.  The headmaster arranges matches
 for the teams.  Wigmore school holds  
 an annual event called the Wigmore    
 tournament.  About twenty four teams  
 play in the Wigmore tournament and    
 they are divided into four groups.    
 The winners of each group play in the 
 semi final and the two winners there  
 play in the final.  The winning team  
 is the team that wins the final.      
   In cricket you have to defend the   
 three stumps behind you and hit the   
 ball.  If you hit the ball a long way 
 you run up the other end for a run.   
 The team with the most runs wins.  We 
 practise different games every        
 Wednesday.                            </content>
