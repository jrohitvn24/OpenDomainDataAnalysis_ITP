		<title>04BARLEY FARM</title>
		<content>  Barley Farm  consists of an old black
 and white farmhouse and 76 acres of   
 land.It is owned by Mr&amp;Mrs.G.Brooke,  
 who bought it 15 years ago.They also  
 own about 16 acres of land at HalfKey,
 which is about 5 miles away from      
 Barley Farm.                          
  Mr.Brooke keeps three types of cattle
 Hereford cross,Limousin and Charolais.
 He goes to market most days as he buys
 and sells cattle for local farmers as 
 well as for himself.He also keeps     
 sheep for breeding, selling the fat   
 lambs and pigs for pork.              
  He doesn't grow cereals but grows    
 grass for silage, hay and pasture.    
  He grubbed out his orchards as the   
 profit from small scale fruit growing 
 was very low.In our survey we found a 
 number of farms where this had been   
 done.                                 
                                       </content>
