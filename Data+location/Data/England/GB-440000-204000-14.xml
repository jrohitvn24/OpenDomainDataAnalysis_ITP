{HARCOURT FAMILY}                      
                                       
 The Harcourt Family came over to join 
 King William just after 1066.  One    
 married Isabel de Courville and was   
 given the Manor of Stanton as dowry.  
 House subsequently built, and part    
 remains today, the old domestic       
 Kitchen, and Popes Tower a chapel with
 4 rooms above - the Priest's living   
 quarters.  The tower was so called    
 because the poet Alexander Pope lived 
 there for some time.                  
                                       
 The Harcourt Family have had          
 connections with the village for 37   
 generations.
