		<title>04Beverstone Castle:Chapel.</title>
		<content> Of particular interest inside the     
 castle is the magnificent Berkeley    
 Chapel which is on the second floor of
 the western wing.The room has a       
 stone-vaulted roof with carved        
 bosses.On the walls of the            
 chapel,surrounded by fine carvings are
 the piscina,where the holy vessels    
 were washed and the sedilia,where the 
 priest sat.An unusual feature is the  
 stone seat near the window.It has been
 suggested that this was for the       
 commander of the castle and that it   
 enabled him to keep an eye open for   
 invaders even when he was saying his  
 prayers!
