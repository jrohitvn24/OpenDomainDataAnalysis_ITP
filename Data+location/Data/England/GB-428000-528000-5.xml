		<title>05A farm worker's day</title>
		<content>   At 8 a.m. I tend to the animals on  
 and around the farm. 12 noon to 12.30 
 p.m. is lunch time. I check all the   
 animals in the fields after 12.30 p.m.
 to ensure that none of them are       
 missing or injured. From around 2.00  
 p.m. the time is spent fencing and    
 doing odd-jobs about the farm         
 including the buildings. 5.00 p.m.    
 and I round up the cows for evening   
 milking.                              
{  Q.4. Are there any jobs that occur  
{at special times of the year?         
   A.4. At harvest time the corn has to
 be cut, whatever type wheat or barley,
 and the straw has to be cut and bailed
 for winter bedding for the farm       
 stock.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
