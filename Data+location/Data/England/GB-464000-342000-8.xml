		<content>   Mrs.Kilborn told us how farming has 
 changed since the war.Cows are now    
 milked by machine,not hand and milk is
 loaded directly on to tankers;tractors
 are used instead of horses.           
   Oats,barley and wheat were harvested
 by hand, stooked in the field and left
 to dry before threshing.Now a combine 
 harvester is used.Hay was cut with a  
 scythe by a row of men and turned by  
 hand, now it is baled mechanically.   
 Farms have become larger and are run  
 as profit making concerns,not for mere
 subsistence.
