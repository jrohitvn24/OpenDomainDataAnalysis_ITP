		<title>17The First Domesday Book.</title>
		<content> We found that three local places were 
 mentioned in the first {Domesday Book}
 and we decided to check their present 
 populations to see how much bigger    
 they had grown.When they were put into
 the first {Domesday Book}they had     
 about 100 people between them. That is
 an average population of 33.          
 We looked at the 1981 Census.         
                                       
                  Population.(1981)    
     Aston Juxta                       
     Mondrum.     Then 33. Now 173.    
     Pool         Then 33. Now 109.    
     Worleston.   Then 33. Now 270.    
                                       
 Some of these people still work on    
 farms like their ancestors did, but a 
 lot now go into Crewe to work at Rolls
 Royce or at British Rail Engineering. 
 They aren't all that much bigger 800  
 years after {Domesday. }              </content>
