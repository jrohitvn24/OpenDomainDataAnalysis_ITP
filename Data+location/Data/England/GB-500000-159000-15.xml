		<title>15Tap Dancing Class, Woking.</title>
		<content>  On Tuesday evenings I go to Tap      
 Dancing with Mrs Walker. The class is 
 in a Church Hall attached to the      
 Church of the Good Shepherd in        
 Pyrford.                              
  When we arrive there at 5.40pm I have
 to wait for my sister's class to start
 and finish so I take a book to read.  
 When our class starts Mrs Walker takes
 the register then we have a warm up.  
 There are nine girls in the class.Most
 of us wear brightly coloured leotards 
 or cat suits but some girls wear      
 shorts and tops. We all wear tap shoes
 which have steel pieces on the tips of
 the toes and heels.                   
  The pianist, Mrs Oxley, is very good 
 because she has been there a long     
 time.                                 
  At the end of each term we have a    
 show when our parents come to see what
 we have been doing during the term.   </content>
