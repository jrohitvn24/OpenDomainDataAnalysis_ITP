		<content> The land surrounding Gosberton Clough 
 is very, very flat, few trees and few 
 houses. The hamlet of Gosberton       
 Clough, has no shop or pub, but there 
 is a Primary School, roll about 60,   
 the children are bussed to the school 
 from the surrounding country-side.    
 Most of the residents are small       
 farmers and their families, nearly all
 the land is arable, crops grown,      
 wheat, barley, sugar-beet, potatoes,  
 onions, vegetables and some bulbs     
 (daffodils and tulips). In the very   
 isolated areas houses are deserted and
 stand empty. Drainage in this region  
 is very important to the farmers,     
 dykes seperate the fields and carry   
 the surplus water out to the wash.    
 There is a small church and a chapel  
 and good community spirit, also a     
 flourishing Young Farmer's Club. Some 
 of the houses are sold to people from </content>
