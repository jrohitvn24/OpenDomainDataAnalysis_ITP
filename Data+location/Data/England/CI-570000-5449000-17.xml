		<title>17HAUT DE LA GARENNE</title>
		<content>    Haut de la Garenne was originally a
 Boys' Home, but it is now a mixed     
 Children's Home.                      
    I was in care at Haut de la Garenne
 for eleven months. It is a very big   
 building with beautiful grounds. It is
 situated above Gorey Castle and has   
 views of the castle and the beach.    
 When I went there all of the building 
 was being used, but when I left only  
 a third of it was in use.             
    It is a shame, because it is       
 gradually being closed. It is such a  
 lovely place, and I shall be sorru to 
 see it close.                         
    Opposite Haut de la Garenne is     
 Faldouet dolmen, which is an ancient  
 stone monument where throughout the   
 years witchcraft has taken place.     
    Altogether Haut de la Garenne and  
 its surroundings are some of my       
 favourite parts of Jersey.            </content>
