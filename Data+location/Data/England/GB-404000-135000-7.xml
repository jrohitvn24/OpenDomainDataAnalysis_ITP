		<title>07Oak Apple Day.Wishford.</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 29th May Oak Apple Day is
 celebrated in Wishford.The villagers  
 protect their rights which originally 
 were collecting firewood from Grovely 
 woods,grazing animals and receiving   
 half a buck.These rights were written 
 down in a Charter in 1603,but have    
 existed from "time out of mind".Only  
 one right is now used this is         
 collecting firewood.                  
   Early in the morning oak boughs are 
 cut and the largest hung from the     
 church tower.Then the Charter is read 
 in Salisbury Cathedral and four ladies
 dance outside.The Oak Apple Club      
 lunch is followed by a procession     
 through the village carrying oak      
 boughs and a banner saying" Grovely,  
 Grovely,Grovely,and all Grovely.Unity 
 is strength".After this a fete is held
 in the Oak Apple Field.               
                                       </content>
