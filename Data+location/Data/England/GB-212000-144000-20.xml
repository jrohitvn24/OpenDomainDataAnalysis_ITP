		<title>20Lundy- a sort of poem.</title>
		<content> Hi!We went to Lundy-it was ACE. We    
 went to our rooms(The Quarters) the   
 girl's place,while the boys went to   
 The Barn. Up above the road was the   
 farm. Later we had a little walk on   
 the eastern side,everyone objected to 
 the idea-they all tried to hide. Then 
 Sunday we were going to walk the whole
 island-the BIG day.Later we went down 
 to the Landing Beach to have a swim   
 -what in the middle of May! Alright   
 then we'll save it for another day.In 
 the morning we went to the shop, they 
 have ace things in there,it's the top.
 Later we went to the church where     
 there are bells on the ground which do
 not make a sound.John Ogilvy showed us
 the garden,I stepped on some flowers  
 and begged his pardon.Then sadly the  
 days went past,suddenly it was time to
 go home-it had all gone so fast!
