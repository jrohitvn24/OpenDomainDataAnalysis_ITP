		<title>03STAPLETON CHURCH.</title>
		<content>   The first record of the church is in
 1291,and it acquired burial rights in 
 the churchyard from the{Pope}in       
 1399.In the year 1785 a{"Brief"}was   
 issued to raise Â£1,300 for the        
 restoration of the church but it      
 doesn't mean all the money was        
 raised.In the church today there      
 stands a notice recording rather      
 quaintly that the church was "repaired
 and new pewed"in the rectorship of the
 Rev.Edward Powys a relative of the    
 Lord of the Manor.The Churchwardens   
 are named and also the "Overseers",one
 of whom bore the famous{Stapleton     
 family name of Oakley.The Rev.CWA     
 Fielding provided in the Vestry Book  
 started in 1866.Not only did he       
 supervise the work done under the     
 direction of the London architect,Mr. 
 Carpenter but he and his Powys        
 relations contributed more than Â£1,000</content>
