 were approaching ,it looked like a cup
 and saucer. It is now a Maritime      
 Museum owned by the Ancient Monument  
 Committee. It is not known how old it 
 is,but it was there in 1680. You walk 
 through a low doorway. There were 150 
 shipwrecks between 1734 and 1974.     
 Downstairs there are 5 glass cases    
 with pieces from the ships.           
 Candlesticks,spoons,knives and a      
 compass are from{Sprightly},which{sank

 from the{Boreas}(1807). There are     
 candlesticks,a teapot and a brass     
 porthole from the{Yorouba}(1888).
