		<content>   The twelve square kilometre area we 
 have studied for the Domesday Project 
 covers a sparsely populated part in   
 the south of the county of Hereford   
 and Worcester.                        
   During the Roman occupation it was  
 the site of an important iron smelting
 town,on the direct route west from    
 Gloucester.Today it is a peaceful     
 farming community which has not       
 outwardly changed much through the    
 years.                                
   We have tried to show you life as it
 is today.We have looked at farms,at   
 all the small industries in our area. 
 There is a detailed breakdown of      
 housing here and we have looked at    
 aspects of natural history.We have    
 looked at life-styles today and       
 compared them with those of eighty    
 years ago.Finally we have tried to    
 show what matters to us today.        </content>
