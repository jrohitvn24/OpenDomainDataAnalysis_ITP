		<content>    The fifteen square kilometer area  
 is 90% reclaimed land.All the land    
 lies below 8m and was reclaimed from  
 the estuary of the Tees.The area south
 of the river was reclaimed            
 first,during the last decade of the   
 nineteenth century.Reclamation of the 
 Seal sands area to the north of the   
 river was undertaken by ICI and       
 Monsanto since 1970                   
    The area is almost all industrial  
 providing work for over 1000 people   
 yet no people live in the 15 square   
 kilometer area.Access is limited and  
 workers are conveyed mainly by private
 bus.Entry to every grid square except 
 those in the south east is achieved by
 security pass.The general public does 
 not have access unless by prior       
 arrangement.
