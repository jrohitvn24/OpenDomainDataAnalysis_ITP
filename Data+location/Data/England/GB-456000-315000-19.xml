		<title>19BARROW CHURCHES</title>
		<content> In 1820 there were two Methodist      
 Churches one on North Street the other
 on High Street. In 1970 the           
 congregations began to use the church 
 on North Street. In 1822 the first    
 Baptist Church was built, later in    
 1875 it was replaced by the present   
 church. In the church grounds stood   
 eleven graves. The parish Church, Holy
 Trinity was built in the 1100's. The  
 tower was built again in 1869, after  
 it fell down while it was being       
 underpinned. The noise was heard all  
 over Barrow. In the 1800's to signal  
 fires in the village the bells were   
 rung backwards. The small Catholic    
 Church, St. Albans, was built at the  
 same time as the railway in 1839. The 
 jitty running beside the church is    
 called Hollybush Lane. The Church of  
 Christ meets at Bishop Beveridge on   
 South Street.{L.MORLEY,J.SCATTERGOOD  </content>
