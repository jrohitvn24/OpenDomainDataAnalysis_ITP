		<title>20      RECREATION</title>
		<content>   With regard to recreation, as with  
 Arts and Crafts, activities are       
 centred in and around the home.  Sport
 is not an organised activity in the   
 area but appears to take place on an  
 individual basis.  Gardening seems to 
 be the dominant form of recreation and
 many gardens reflect this interest.   
 Sports enjoyed include shooting and   
 golf - the former taking place within 
 the confines of Harnage Grange.       
 Walking is another form of recreation 
 within the area.                      
   There are no facilities for public  
 recreation e.g. swimming,pool or      
 football.  People will have to travel 
 to Shrewsbury in order to take part in
 these activities.                     
   Not a great deal of television is   
 watched, with most people watching    
 news programmes and an occasional     
 interest shown in soap operas.        </content>
