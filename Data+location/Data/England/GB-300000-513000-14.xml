		<title>14CLEATOR MOOR - THE TOWN</title>
		<content> Cleator Moor is a long straggling     
 small town, surrounded by the scenic  
 mountains of the Lake District on one 
 side and the rolling hills of West    
 Cumbria of the other. Looking towards 
 Ennerdale, the views are truly        
 magnificent, especially if there is   
 snow.                                 
                                       
 The town is long and narrow with a    
 surprising number of shops. It        
 sometimes appears very sleepy,        
 although it certainly comes to life on
 Fridays when there is a busy market.  
                                       
 Of particular pride in the town are   
 the fine public buildings in the      
 market place - the library, the       
 community hall and the town council   
 offices and also the striking ironwork
 facade of the Co-operative Foodstore.
