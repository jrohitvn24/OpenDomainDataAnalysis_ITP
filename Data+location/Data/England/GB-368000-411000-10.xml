		<title>10RAVEDEN WOOD</title>
		<content> Off Moss Bank Way there is a wood     
 called Raveden Wood.Inside it there   
 are a lot of wild flowers like        
 Daisies,Buttercups and Bluebells.The  
 Brook is not really very clean,because
 the iron in the water makes it orange.
 The paths have arrows on to show you  
 where to go.There are some bridges    
 over the brooks which are made out of 
 stone or metal.The river is not fast  
 flowing and it runs in different      
 directions.                           
 Through the woods we got to two       
 schools Smithills Comprehensive and   
 the Sixth Form College.We saw a pond  
 which wasn't very safe.The sides were 
 steep and it wasn't fenced off.There  
 is a cub hut which always gets        
 vandalised.It is made of wood and it  
 does not look nice at all.
