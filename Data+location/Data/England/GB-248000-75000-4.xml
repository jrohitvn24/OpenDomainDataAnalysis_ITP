		<title>04Employment in Peter Tavy</title>
		<content>   Most people of working age in       
 this area have jobs. There is only one
 bus to Tavistock once a week so people
 have to find their own transport to   
 get to work.Most people work on the   
 land,farming and forestry,but others  
 have professions such as consultants, 
 managers and accountants.Work provided
 in Peter Tavy is only at the Post     
 Office/Shop and the other occupation  
 around the village is lorry driving.So
 far we have found out that employment 
 in this area is not satisfactory.     
 People have to go to Tavistock,       
 Plymouth and other towns for work.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
