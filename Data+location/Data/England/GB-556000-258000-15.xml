		<title>15MARES &amp; FOALS ON THE STUD</title>
		<content>    In the spring and early summer, the
 five mares are sent away to mate      
 because there are no stallions on{Hare
{Park}Stud Farm. If they are not in    
 foal, they go back to the same        
 stallion. The last day that they can  
 be covered or mated is 15th.July. The 
 gestation period of a horse is eleven 
 months. Most of the foals are born    
 between March and April. This is the  
 best time for them to be born because 
 there is plenty of fresh young grass  
 for them.                             
    The foals stay at the stud until   
 they are 'yearlings'.(All racehorses  
 have their birthday on the same day   
 (January 1st.) irrespective of when   
 their real birthday is _ this is      
 because there are special races for   
 two-year-olds, three-year-olds etc.)
