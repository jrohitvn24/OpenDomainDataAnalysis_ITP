		<title>14Norley Brownies</title>
		<content>  The 2nd Norley Brownies is held from 
 18.00 to 19.00 hrs. every Wednesday at
 Norley Primary School.  There are     
 about 21 girls in the pack aged 8 to  
 10 years.  We have a Brown Owl and a  
 Snowy Owl.  we have 3 sixes which are 
 Kelpies, Sprites and Gnomes, and there
 are about 6 girls in each six.  We    
 wear a brown dress and hat. We make a 
 promise "I promise that I will do my  
 best to do my duty to God and the     
 Queen and to keep the Brownie Guide   
 law".                                 
  At Brownies we play games from other 
 countries or we do journey work which 
 is doing badges and tests.  I have    
 done 2 badges.  Journey work comes up 
 about every two weeks.                
  Last week we all went to a pageant at
 Widnes.  I had to carry the flag for  
 the 2nd Norley.  Afterwards we wnt to 
 a party in a very old bus.            </content>
