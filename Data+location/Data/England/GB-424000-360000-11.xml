		<title>11Mixed Farm</title>
		<content> Lobby Farm was originally part of     
 Snitterton Hall.The farm is now owned 
 by Ron,Ivan and Shaun.They have a dog 
 called Gyp.When he was a puppy he     
 used to chase the lambs.They had one  
 orphan lamb that I called Larry.They  
 have 25 Hereford and 40 Fresian cows  
 that give 450 litres of milk a day    
 and a few bullocks.There are 85 lambs 
 born of 55 Gunnforest ewes.           
 The farm uses lots of modern machinery
 including a baler,tractor,and muck    
 spreader. For hay making there is a   
 cutter,tedder and baler.              
 They have recently used the farm to   
 film Silas Marner.The film also       
 included shots of Oaker Hill, down    
 in Northerndale and Wensley Dale.
