		<title>20HOME LIFE IN CALLINGTON AREA</title>
		<content> The area east of Callington is        
 principally a{dormitory area}for      
 people working in Plymouth;           
 professional, Service or Dockyard as  
 main amployment.  New estates and     
 Naval influence bring a high          
 percentage of in-coming families to   
 the area, with the older farming      
 community as the stable base of       
 extended family life.  Apart from the 
 council estate there is little        
{unemployment,}but low wages do mean   
 that many wives also have to work.    
 Almost all homes have a television,   
 fridge and washing machine, many have 
 a freezer, tumble-drier, stereo and   
 video equipment.  A car is essential; 
 some families have a{second vehicle   
 for a working member of the family - a
 car, motor-cycle or moped - while the 
 wife uses the family car for shopping 
 or school.                            </content>
