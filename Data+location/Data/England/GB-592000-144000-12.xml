		<title>12PLUCKLEY GHOSTS 1</title>
		<content> There are reputedly 12 traditional    
 ghosts belonging to Pluckley and      
 dozens more unofficial ghosts. There  
 are many books written about the      
 ghosts of Pluckley but very little    
 evidence of their existence before the
 turn of the century.                  
{THE RED LADY}is a sorrowing ghost     
 because her baby died as soon as it   
 was born and that is why she walks    
 through the graveyard looking for an  
 unmarked grave with her baby in it.   
{THE COLONEL}hung himself from a branch
 of a tree in Park Wood, which since   
 that time has been home for his       
 restless spirit. It is thought that   
 he, like many of the Pluckley ghosts, 
 was a member of the Dering family.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
