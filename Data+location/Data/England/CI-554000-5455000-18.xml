 after bathrooms were built            
 downstairs. The houses are made of    
 brick, and usually have 1 kitchen and 
 sometimes a dining room. Our house has
 three bedrooms; some of the other     
 houses have got four or two  bedrooms.
 The houses  usually have at least 1   
 toilet,1 bathroom and 1 lounge. The   
 roofs have brown tiles, the gardens

 1.59 metres wide. The doors are made  
 of wood.                              </content>
