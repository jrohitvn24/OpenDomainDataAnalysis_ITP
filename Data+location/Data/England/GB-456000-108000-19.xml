		<title>19SOCIAL CONCERNS IN N.FAREHAM</title>
		<content> As a result of our interviews with    
 local people certain social concerns  
 came to light.The farmers were        
 concerned about the way decisions made
 in the European parliament affected   
 their lives and income.The E.E.C. milk
 quotas,which caused them to reduce the
 size of their dairy herds,was a recent
 example of this.Some local dwellers   
 were concerned about rumours that     
 Knowle Hospital was to be closed and  
 mental patients were to be placed in  
 houses amidst the local community.Two 
 other often expressed concerns were   
 the noise and danger from youngsters  
 on motorbikes in the copses,and also  
 dogowners who allowed their dogs to   
 foul footpaths were a cause for       
 concern.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
