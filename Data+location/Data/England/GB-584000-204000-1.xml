		<title>01THE LOCAL TOWN</title>
		<content>   Maldon has a long interesting hist- 
 ory and was mentioned in the original 
 Domesday book.The centre of the town  
 is still at the top of the hill where 
 the first settlement was started.Today
 it's a busy,thriving town which is ex-
 panding all the time with new housing 
 estates and businesses.Many buildings 
 are very old,some dating back to the  
 fourteenth century.                   
   One of the main features is the Riv-
 er Blackwater to which Maldon owes    
 much of its early importance.The river
 is now used both commercially and for 
 recreation.                           
   Maldon has kept its character desp- 
 ite changes over the past 20 years-   
 notably an increase in traffic.The    
 proposed by-pass in 1987 will help    
 preserve ancient buildings by removing
 heavy juggernauts which constantly    
 rumble through the narrow streets.    </content>
