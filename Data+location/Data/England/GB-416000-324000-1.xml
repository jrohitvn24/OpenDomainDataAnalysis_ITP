		<title>01OVERVIEW OF NEEDWOOD AREA</title>
		<content> The area lies in what was the north   
 east area of{Needwood Forest.} Despite
 earlier attempts at disafforestation  
 the area was finally enclosed         
 following the 1801 Act.               
                                       
 The results of this are obvious today 
 in the{hedged fields}and{straight     
{roads.} Considerable{woodlands}remain,
 some planted with quick growing       
 conifers, but most contain a mix of   
 deciduous trees.  There is{little     
{standing or running water.            
                                       
 There are{no villages,}but scattered  
 farmhouses and cottages.  Apart from  
 those in agriculture, the majority of 
 people{work}outside the area.  Large  
 areas of land are owned by the{Duchy  
{of Lancaster,}and Her Majesty Queen   
 Elizabeth II visited her estates here 
 in the early 1980s.                   </content>
