		<content> Leigh's Wood adjoins Leighswood J.M.I.
 School and although it is an          
 established wood, recorded in Norman  
 times, it was untidy and rather bare. 
 The West Midlands County Council and  
 the British Trust for Conservation    
 Volunteers combined forces in         
 "Operation Acorn" in March 1985 to    
 improve the quality and variety of    
 growth in Leigh's Wood. The schools   
 were involved in planting a variety of
 trees. With a volunteer helper each   
 child planted one or more new trees.  
 More than 500 trees were planted. This
 forms part of the "Nature Conservation
 Strategy" for the West Midlands. The  
 trees make "stepping stones" in the   
 flight path of many birds, and other  
 travelling wildlife of the urban area.
 Variety in trees encouraging a variety
 of wildlife. A legacy for the future.
