		<content> Shudy Camps is a little smaller than  
 Castle Camps. There is only one post  
 office. There is not much traffic.    
 There are two T juntions in Main      
 Street.There is also one up beside the
 church. There are no pubs. There used 
 to be one pub in Main Street called   
 the Three Horse Shoes.Where the old   
 vicarage is there used to be a school.
 There are three farms in Shudy        
 Camps.They are called Carters Farm,   
 Lower Farm and Lord ship Farm.There is
 nowhere to play, only a meadow which  
 belongs to Mr Kiddy.Most of the fields
 grow wheat and some have cows in      
 them.There is a private park with     
 three cottages with it.The nearest    
 shopping centre is in Haverhill.There 
 are quite a few footpaths.
