		<title>14Class Assemblies</title>
		<content> Each week a class at Great Horwood    
School takes a turn in leading the     
school assembly. Quite often the class 
responsible will present a short play  
or series of sketches to make their    
point. Sometimes the assembly will show
the rest of the school ideas which have
come out of the work the class are     
studying at present.                   
 One class had been studying food and  
presented an assembly about breakfasts 
around the world. They made the point  
about the lack of food in many         
countries, particularly in {Ethiopia}  
and the {Sudan} and made a collection  
for famine relief.                     
 Another class presented a modern day  
version of {The Good Samaritan},where  
the traveller was mugged by youths on  
BMX bikes. A lively assembly which made
its point.                             
                                       </content>
