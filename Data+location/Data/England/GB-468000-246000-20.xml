{  }Designed by{Gilbert Scott}and built
 in{1836}to hold up to{208}people. It  
 only ever averaged up to{80}people    
 though, at a cost of{14p}each per     
 week.                                 
    The workhouse was closed in 1931   
 and is now owned by Northamptonshire  
 County Council.                       
                                       
{THE CHANTRY HOUSE:}                   
    This was originally the{Grammar    
{School}and was founded as part of the 
 Archdeacon's will. Until{1866}it was  
 the school and master's residence, but
 then it was sold and most of it       
 rebuilt.                              
                                       
{MILL:}This was recorded in the        
 original Doomsday book, but was badly 
 damaged by{fire in 1911.
