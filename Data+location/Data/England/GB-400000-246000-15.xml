		<title>15Cotswold Line Promotion</title>
		<content>   The railway line which runs along   
 the South section of the survey area  
 in the main Hereford to London        
 line.The Herefrd to Oxford section is 
 mainly single tracked.Much of the line
 on the flood plane below Wood Norton  
 has been built up on an embackment    
 above the flood plain.This has to be  
 repaired regularly due to subsidence. 
   The Cotswold Line Promotion Group   
 formed in March 1978.They had aims of 
 promoting and publicising bus and     
 train feeder communications between   
 Oxford and Worcester.The Group thinks 
 that a service of "Inter-City" and    
 Local Services is important to the    
 future of the railway.The line is at  
 risk and the Group is tyring to get   
 more passenger and freight use so no  
 more downgrading or closure may       
 happen.                               
                                       </content>
