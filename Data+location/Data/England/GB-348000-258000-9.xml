		<content> We play games all the year round. In  
 winter we play more indoor games such 
 as card and board games like Snap,    
 Chess, Monoply and Snakes and Ladders.
 Sometimes we play computer games.     
 Outside the boys enjoy playing        
 football and running games. In the    
 autumn they like to play conkers. The 
 girls play netball, hockey and running
 games.                                
 In summer the boys play football and  
 marbles, whilst the girls enjoy       
 skipping games and action-song games. 
 We also play sports such as jumping   
 and racing. Sometimes we make up our  
 own games. Usually the boys and girls 
 do not play with each other but       
 sometimes they do.
