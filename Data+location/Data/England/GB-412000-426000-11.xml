		<title>11EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>   National trends in the changing face
 of industry and employment are well   
 reflected in our area which has a     
 relatively high level of unemployment.
   The importance of textiles  and iron
 in the area has declined, but these   
 have been replaced by many new        
 industries.                           
   The chemical industry has a long    
 acquaintance with Wyke, and Allied    
 Colloids and Mark's Chemicals still   
 provide a lot of employment.          
   Just to the east of our block, the  
 large Euroway Industrial Estate has   
 been developed next to the M606.  This
 provides work for many people from    
 Wyke and Low Moor.                    
   A Department of Employment Skill    
 Centre runs courses for retraining    
 unemployed people from the Bradford   
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
