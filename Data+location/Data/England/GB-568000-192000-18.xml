 I enjoy Indian meals most. Now and    
 again my mum phones up the Indian     
 restaurant and orders us one. It is a 
 bit spicey and hot though. I like the 
 tandori chicken and rice that is      
 served with it. It must take a while  
 for the chef to cook because they have
 a rather long menu. I like lemon_ices,
 they are very refreshing when you are 
 hot. I usually buy one when the ice_  
 cream man comes around. We eat our    
 dinner at the table, but when we have 
 something like sandwiches or soup we  
 eat it in the living_room, on the     
 coffee table. We always have the      
 television on when we are having our  
 dinner, as it keeps us amused. When we
 are in a hurry we have rather quick   
 meals which are easy to prepare.
