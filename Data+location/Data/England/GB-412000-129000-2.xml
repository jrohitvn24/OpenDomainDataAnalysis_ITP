		<title>02SALISBURY CATHEDRAL &amp; CLOSE</title>
		<content> The Cathedral's magnificent 404' Spire
 the tallest in the country, can be    
 seen from all roads entering the city.
 In 1984 over 500,000 Tourists, visited
 the Cathedral, attracted by the spire 
 and the peaceful Close with its lawns 
 and historic houses. This year the    
 number will increase. The money they  
 contribute helps raise the Â£1400      
 needed daily to run the cathedral and 
 keep it a living worshipping community
                                       
 Recent artistic additions to the Close
 and Cathedral are'The Walking Madonna'
 by Elizabeth Frink and a new stained- 
 glass East window by Gabriel Loire    
 of Chartres, dedicated to Prisoners of
 Conscience. Both of these have caused 
 controversy partly because of the cost
 and partly because  some people have  
 difficulty understanding them though  
 agree the window colour is glorious.  </content>
