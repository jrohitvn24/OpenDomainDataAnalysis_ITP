		<content>{LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT OVER GAINFORD}    
 On 8th May 1985 it was reported in the
{Teesdale Mercury,}that a low flying   
 aircraft zoomed so close to{Snow      
{Hall,}near Gainford, that windows     
 smashed and a horse bolted onto the   
 main road. A{R.A.F.}officer and the   
{Department of Environment}are trying  
 to trace the pilot and the aircraft.  
 The owner of{Snow Hall,}protested to  
 the{Ministry of Defence,}that the     
 aeroplane was flying dangerously low. 
 The horse, however, damaged a wall.   
 Gainford residents have complained    
 before about low flying aircraft.     
 Gainford seems to be on the flight    
 path for these{Harrier, Jaguar}and    
{Tornado}aircraft. Inhabitants of the  
 village appreciate the need to train  
 pilots in low flying and are prepared 
 to tolerate some disturbance but not  
 if damage to property is caused.      </content>
