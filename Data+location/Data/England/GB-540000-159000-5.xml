       The Industrial Estate is located
 on the southern edge of the airort and
 comprises 16 modern general purpose   
 factories and warehouses.  Most of the
 companies use their buildings for     
 storage and distribution purposes and 
 employ between 5 to 15 people.  One of
 the companies, Laser-Tech uses a low  
 powered laser for cutting plastics for
 display signs.  This indusrry chose   
 the site because of its proximity to  
 London and the motorway system.  The  
 equipment they use is custom built.   
 The raw materials come from various   
 British plastic manufacturers and all 
 the products are sold on the home     
 market.  They employ 5 people, two in 
 management who deal with purchasding, 
 sales and production, one secretary   
 and two production workers.           </content>
