		<title>01Summary of area as a whole</title>
		<content>The area we have been studying is made 
up of lots of different places;Boothen,
West End,Hanford,Clayton,Trent-Vale and
Penkhull.All the places are very       
different from each other.             
  Hanford is mainly a housing estate   
with some farm land around it.Where    
Hanford and Boothen come together there
is a very busy road system.This was    
built about seven years ago.The        
Michelin factory takes up a lot of     
space in this area.Trent-Vale is mainly
council housing while Clayton is a     
mixture of council estates and large   
private houses.                        
Boothen and West End have many streets 
of terraced houses.There are lots of   
small shops along the main road.       
Penkhull is a residential area.The     
houses are detached and semi-detached. 
Most of them have large gardens.
