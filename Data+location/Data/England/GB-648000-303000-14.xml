		<title>141985 BRADWELL CYCLE RIDE</title>
		<content>   The cycle ride this year took       
 place on Sunday 7th July. About 140   
 cyclists turned up to pedal their way 
 around the local countryside. As      
 usual, the event took place in fancy  
 dress. This year the theme was 'fairy 
 tales'. The colourful procession was  
 seen off by the mayor of Gt. Yarmouth 
 at 11.00 am. An enthusiastic crowd    
 clapped as each group of cyclists     
 started. Lunch was taken at a pub in  
 Somerleyton. Apart from a puncture in 
 Goldilocks' rear tyre, there were no  
 mishaps.                              
   The organisers are hoping to raise  
 Â£3000 this year to buy a{C T scanner  
 for the James Paget hospital in       
 Gorleston. The ride is one of hundreds
 of fund-raising events for this vital 
 piece of equipment designed to detect 
 cancer. The scanner will cost Â£370,000
 to buy and instal.                    </content>
