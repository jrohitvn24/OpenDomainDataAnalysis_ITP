 eventually through Mountsorrel and    
 Leicester. Beside the river is a pub  
 called the{Riverside.}The river is an 
 attraction for families in summer.    
 People come on boats to Barrow on the 
 river. When the river floods the{Slabs
 are not affected because the{Slabs}are
 raised above the ground so that when  
 the flood comes you can walk along the
 path to Quorn without getting wet. The

 popular in summer for getting a tan.  
 Over the river is a bridge where you  
 can see the{key stone.}Next to the    
 river is an old{Boat House.}On the
