		<title>20LIFE AT HOME IN CAYTON</title>
		<content> At home I love to read and my hobbies 
 are model making and stamp collecting.
 I like animals and we have a Cairn    
 terrier, a green budgerigar and a     
 rabbit. During school holidays I go   
 with my friend to my uncle's farm and 
 then I wish I had a sister or brother.
 My parents have bought me lots of     
 things but the ones I like best are my
 electric organ and my guitar. I'd like
 to be a musician when I grow up, so   
 that I can entertain people.          
 For entertainment we go into          
 Scarborough, to the cinema or theatre.
 I like watching the television and    
 wonder what life was like without it. 
 Living in 1985 is good because of all 
 the modern things we have and all the 
 exciting things we can do, but I wish 
 people cared more about each other and
 didn't go around planting bombs to    
 hurt people.                          </content>
