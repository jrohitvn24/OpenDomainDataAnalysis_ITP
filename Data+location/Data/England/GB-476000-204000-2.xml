		<content> The population of Longwick is about   
 l200. Not many people work in Longwick
 itself, as it is mainly a farming     
 community, but it provides a pleasant 
 place to live for people who work in  
 the Aylesbury and High Wycombe area,  
 or even, with the easy access to      
 Princes Risborough station, for       
 commuters to London.   The village is 
 about two kilometres long with three  
 pubs.  Some farms access direct on to 
 the main road through the village.    
 The one combined shop and post office 
 provides a meeting place for the      
 village where pensions and allowances 
 are able to be collected, and which   
 gives a gathering place for the local 
 news and views and enables a caring   
 eye to be kept on the local old       
 people.  Daily necessities can also be
 bought here.                          
                                       </content>
