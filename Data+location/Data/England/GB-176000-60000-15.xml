		<title>15HOBBIES FROM CRANTOCK</title>
		<content> The people we met had interesting     
 hobbies - thats how they use their    
 spare time. {Woodcarving:}Driftwood is
 collected from the beach and dried for
 about 3 years.  Cherry, Lime and Oak  
 are the best woods for carving.  About
 30 tools are needed, many of which are
 old and irreplaceable.  Fish and bird 
 shapes are often carved and then the  
 wood is polished. {Crochet:}This is   
 the art of making knots with a special
 hooked needle. The knotted thread     
 'grows' just like knitting.  One lady 
 made things like a peacock, a patch-  
 work cathedral, a starched crochet    
 vase for dried flowers and soft toy   
 animals.{Lacemaking:}Lace is still    
 made by some ladies in Crantock but we
 were not fortunate enough to see it.{
