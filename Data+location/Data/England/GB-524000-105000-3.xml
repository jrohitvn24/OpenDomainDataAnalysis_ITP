		<content>  A sample survey investigating        
 employment of the parents of children 
 in a secondary school &amp; 3 primary     
 schools showed the majority of parents
 work in service industries eg shops,  
 nursing homes &amp; offices &amp; as cooks,   
 electrical engineers,teachers,        
 policemen,surveyors,telephone         
 operators,bus drivers,plumbers and    
 decorators.About two thirds of parents
 are employed locally; of those that   
 worked elsewhere three quarters are   
 employed in Sussex &amp; the rest work in 
 London,other parts of the country eg  
 Hull or abroad eg Holland &amp; Bermuda.  
  Most of the parents are not self     
 employed;those that are work as       
 builders and decorators.              
  In half of the cases where the father
 is unemployed the mother works. Three 
 quarters of mothers works. Most travel
 by car.                               </content>
