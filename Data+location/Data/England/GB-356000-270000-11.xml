		<content> The hedgerows are good cover for a    
 variety of small birds and mammals.   
 Various types of mice, voles, and     
 shrews are common. Foxes,badgers,     
 stoats, weasels, rabbits and hedgehogs
 all use them as a base, as do tits,   
 thrushes, blackbirds, dunnocks, wrens,
 pheasants, bullfinches, goldfinches,  
 various warblers and also little owls.
 The few woods support birch as well as
 oak and ash, and rooks, wood pigeons, 
 cuckoos, three kinds of woodpecker,   
 nuthatches, tree creepers, jays,      
 crows, flycatchers, long tailed tits, 
 owls,woodcock, and occasionally even a
 polecat can be seen. The wetlands have
 a fauna and flora all their own:      
 kingcups, yellow flag, water mints,   
 brooklime, and ladies smock are       
 common: coots and moorhens are        
 frequent, and kingfishers and herons  
 can sometimes be seen.CONTINUED P.12  </content>
