		<content> We are very fortunate living in a     
 rural area. We can grow or rear our   
 own food. This means we can decide    
 about use of chemicals and pesticides.
 Breeds of animals and varieties of    
 vegetables can be grown for quality   
 and flavour.Our free range hens give  
 us eggs fresh from the nest. We can   
 walk round the garden or orchard pick 
 ing and eating the fruit.Some people  
 supplement their income by selling    
 surplus fruit,vegetables and plants.We
 have a very successful summer show in 
 the Village hall run by the W.I.but   
 open to all.Bees pollenate crops and  
 produce honey.In this area with a wide
 selection of blossom we can have a    
 good variety of honey.From the fells  
 we can collect the heather honey with 
 its distinctive flavour.Hobbies       
 include woodwork,needlework,painting, 
 carving,climbing and canoeing.        </content>
