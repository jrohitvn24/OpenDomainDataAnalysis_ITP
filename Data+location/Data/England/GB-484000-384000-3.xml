		<title>03Shopping in Gainsborough.</title>
		<content> Every Friday night after I have got   
 back from school we have our tea,and  
 as soon as my father gets home we go  
 shopping at Morrisons.Morrisons is a  
 large{hypermarket}in Gainsborough and 
 we have to drive five miles to get    
 there.There is no shop in our         
 village,but my mum says that even if  
 there was we would still go to        
 Morrisons because it is the cheapest  
 way of shopping.                      
 At the shop there is a very big car   
 park and a petrol station.We go in    
 through automatic doors and we have to
 use two trolleys for all our          
 shopping.The shop sells all sorts of  
 different things.It sells             
 food,records,tapes,furnitire,clothes  
 and things for the garden but we      
 usually go there to buy all the food  
 that we need for the week.If we forget
 anything Dad buys it in Lincoln.      </content>
