		<content> People in Rusper have a few complaints
 about the village.,{transport}is one  
 of them.Although a bus goes to Horshan
 every day,it is very infrequent.The   
{traffic}through the village at certain
 times of the day is noisy,causes      
 congestion and is sometimes dangerous.
 Another thing which is very annoying  
 to some people is {aeroplane noise.}Up
 to 10 planes an hour fly over the     
 village as it is on the direct flypath
 from Gatwick Airport.  When it is a   
 hot day they like to have their       
 windows open and sometimes listen to  
 the radio or watch television,if a    
 plane goes by they can hardly hear    
 anything.Some people who have lived   
 there for a long time say they have   
 got used to it.There is{only one food 
{shop}and that does not sell meat.Only 
 people who do not own cars seem to    
 mind this.                            </content>
