		<content> Previously known as Barton Farm, this 
 farm was bought from and re-sold to   
 the quarry owners in the last 25      
 years. The farmhouse is empty, the    
 land being quarried right up to the   
 garden wall. The previous owner farms 
 adjoining land using the farm         
 buildings at Nosehill. He is also     
 growing cereal crops on topsoil laid  
 on the quarry floor. Cows with calves 
 graze land near the quarry, and a     
 cattle shed is built within the       
 quarry.                               
 Kineton Hill Farm is the home of the  
 Sydenham Stud Welsh Cobs. Foals have  
 been exported to 9 different          
 countries. 4 mares and 15 visiting    
 mares are kept. There are 3 stallions.
 Cattle and 50 Jacob sheep are kept on 
 26 hectares. Lambs are sold fat or    
 kept for showing and breeding. Wool is
 sold for spinning.                    </content>
