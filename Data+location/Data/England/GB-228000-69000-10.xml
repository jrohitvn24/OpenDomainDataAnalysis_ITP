		<content> Mining was carried on for about 50    
 years, but gradually the mines closed 
 down. Many of the miners emigrated,   
 others worked on farms or quarries.   
 The village slowly declined until the 
 1960's. Then{more people wanted to own
{their own houses and live in the      
{country.}Several large estates were   
 built, about{250 bungalows}altogether.
 Many of the new village people worked 
 in Plymouth, others moved here to     
 retire in Cornwall. At the present    
 time the village{population}is again  
 near the{2,000}mark.
