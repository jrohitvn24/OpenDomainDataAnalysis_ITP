		<title>06MY SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I am Caroline,I am 11 years old and I 
 go to a primary school in Chippenham. 
 The school is for children aged 5 to  
 11 and there are about 230 of us.We   
 are in classes of about 30 children of
 the same age.                         
 The school day starts at 9.00am.On    
 most mornings all the children go to  
 the school hall for an assembly.      
 At school we read,write,draw,sing,    
 play and make things.We also study for
 project work and religion,do maths and
 have discussions.                     
 We have two breaks in the day;a short 
 one in the morning when we go out on  
 the playground,and a lunch time break.
 There are two sittings for lunch.One  
 for the children who have dinners     
 cooked at school and one for the      
 children who bring packed lunches.    
 Afternoon school finishes at 3.15pm.
