		<content>                                       
 The owners were born in Hong Kong     
 but they lived in Harrow .The fish and
 chip shop has always been a fish and  
 chip shop.The busiest day is Friday.It
 is mostly busy between 5.30 and 7.00. 
 They sell mostly Cod but they do not  
 like fish and chips themselves.They   
 have plenty of helpers. In the summer 
 it is very busy because ofthe tourists
 that come in the summer months. The   
 shop is open every day  except Sunday.
 They start work at 10.00 and finish   
 work at 4.00. They have been at the   
 shop for 3 years. And they like living
 there because it is quiet. The lady   
 could speak English very well but her 
 brother could not.The chips they sell 
 are 30p.
