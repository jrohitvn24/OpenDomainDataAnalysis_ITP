		<title>03ARTHUR MEE:LOCAL PERSONALITY</title>
		<content>   Arthur Mee was born in Stapleford in
 1875, and grew up to be a famous      
 writer of some 80 books for children  
 and adults. He is particularly        
 remembered for his 'Children's        
 Encyclopaedia'.                       
   He was a very energetic man, and was
 editor of The Nottingham Evening News 
 (now defunct) at the age of 20.       
   At 21 he went to London, and shortly
 afterwards was writing two daily      
 columns and editing a weekly paper at 
 the same time. His output at this time
 was estimated at 1 million words a    
 year.                                 
   He died in 1943.                    
   His name is carried today by the    
 Arthur Mee Centre in Stapleford, which
 is used for Adult Education. It is in 
 the building which Arthur Mee himself 
 attended when a boy.
