		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area is quiet and rural, the      
 countryside green gently undulating   
 pasture land and woodland.The two     
 villages{Borwick}and{Priest Hutton}are
 quiet and picturesque and contain only
 one or two local shops.Many of the    
 inhabitants tend to work and shop in  
{Carnforth}or{Lancaster}to the south or
{Kendal}to the north.With the closing  
 down of the limestone quarries farming
 is the main occupation within the     
 area, although many of the farms now  
 run caravan sites on their land for   
 the tourists who find the beauty and  
 quietness very attractive. Further    
 evidence of the change is evident in  
 the large number of farm buildings    
 that have been converted to           
 dwellings many for people working     
 outside the area and for holiday      
 homes.                                
                                       </content>
