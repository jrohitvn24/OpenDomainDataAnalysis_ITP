		<title>12SANTON</title>
		<content> Santon is a small community consisting
 of 6 habitable dwellings, only half of
 which are occupied during the week,   
 and a very small church _ All Saints. 
 It is situated on the north side of   
 the Little Ouse about 1 mile to the   
 east of Santon Downham near St.       
 Helen's car park. The road peters out 
 to tracks, one of which tunnels under 
 the railway and continues to the A134.
 Only one service a year is held in the
 church on the Sunday nearest to the   
 longest day. See also page 11, Worship
 in Santon Downham. All other aspects  
 of life are the same as for Santon    
 Downham except that Santon is in      
 Norfolk and therefore comes under     
 Thetford and the Breckland District.
