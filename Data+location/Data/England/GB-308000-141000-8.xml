 two people to help him. They shoe     
 about{10 to 15 horses a day. It takes 
 roughly an hour to shoe one horse. The
 building has always been a{forge,}and 
 when Mr.Toogood moved in there were   
{hand bellows}instead of electric.     
 But soon after he moved in he changed 
 to an electric fan.
