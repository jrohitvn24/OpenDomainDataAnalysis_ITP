		<content> The first police station was a hut    
 which was accidentely pushed off a    
 train in 1901,when soldiers were      
 coming back from the Boer War.There   
 were two policemen at that time,and   
 there was no transport at all except  
 an old bicycle between them.          
 Now there is a newer and more modern  
 police station which was built in 1922
 with an extention made in 1946. There 
 are now 6 P.C's,1 W.P.C,3 detectives  
 and 2 sergeants.There are also 2      
 police motor-cycles which are Honda's,
 3 police cars which are all Ford      
 Escort's,and 1 car for the C.I.D.     
 There are 8 police houses. The houses 
 numbered from 1-3 used to be flats for
 policemen who were bachelors.The      
 other houses were built in 1964 and   
 are quite new.
