		<title>05THE COMMUNITY CENTRE, CORBY.</title>
		<content>Lodge Park Community Centre serves     
Lodge Park area. Built in 1968, it is  
run &amp; financed by the District Council.
Facilities include a hall to seat 70   
people, a committee room, a kitchen, a 
toilet for the disabled &amp; a storage    
area. Every week the centre is  used by
different groups: the under 5's        
playgroup, every weekday 1.5 hrs.,     
mothers' and children's One O'Clock    
Club, two hrs. twice weekly, Kung Fu   
one evening and various dance clubs,   
ballroom, ballet and tap. Some Saturday
evenings there are wedding receptions, 
socials, discos and private parties. A 
useful social centre; but not for      
teenagers. To them it offers little.   
So, as pubs and fields are out-of-     
bounds, clubs are for adults and parks 
mainly for footballers and dog-walkers,
many seek solace in pop-culture, T.V.  
or mischief.                           </content>
