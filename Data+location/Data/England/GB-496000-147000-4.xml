		<content>  This survey was taken on July 6 1985.
 It was taken by the side of a busy    
 main road near the A3/A31 junction.   
 There were 1528 privately owned cars, 
 6 cars for public use with a "taxi"   
 sign showing,24 motorbikes and        
 bicycles,26 commercial lorries,58 vans
 (commercial and privately owned),6    
 public buses and coaches,8 emergency  
 vehicles _ 4 police cars,2 ambulances,
 2 fire-engines _ and 8 drivers with   
 the official learner plate on their   
 vehicle.                              
  All these figures were taken down in 
 half an hour, so they were doubled to 
 make up an hour.                      
  During the time taken, no Sinclair   
 "C5"s were spotted.
