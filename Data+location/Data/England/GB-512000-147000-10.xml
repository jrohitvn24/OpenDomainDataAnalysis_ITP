 P.C. Stuart informed us that most     
 crimes were committed by those in the 
 14-16 year age group. On crime        
 prevention he said,{"Just being there 
{prevents crime but we can't be        
{everywhere at once."

 villagers were interviewed shows that 
 the public believe theft, litter,     
 vandalism and speeding are problems.  </content>
