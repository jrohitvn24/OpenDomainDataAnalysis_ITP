 Sabden and the surrounding area of our
 D-Block is basically an agricultural  
 area.It is situated 5 miles north-west
 of Burnley and nestles quietly on the 
 slopes of Pendle Hill.This Hill       
 dominates the landscape for many miles
 and is associated with many           
 supernatural superstitions,the main   
 one being the Pendle Witches.It is an 
 area of small close knit communities  
 which are aggressively independent of 
 one another and who take a pride in   
 their own traditions.People who are   
 born in our area tend to remain there 
 most of their lives.There has been a  
 tendency over the past 20 years for   
 'outsiders' to move in attracted by   
 the beautiful scenery,and the relative
 isolation,which allows easy commuting 
 to the towns close by.
