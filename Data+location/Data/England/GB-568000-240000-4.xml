		<title>04The Moot Hall</title>
		<content> At the{Moot Hall}there is a{library   
 on the ground floor.On the first floor
 there is an exhibition of photos and  
 pictures about the history of the     
 village.The Moot Hall is also used for
{parish council}meetings.It is a small 
 two storey sixteenth century timber   
 framed building standing on an island 
 site, at the junction of Chapel Street
 and Church Street. The Moot Hall used 
 to be the old village grammar school  
 which was founded in 1592.            
 Architecturally the building is of    
 interest because of a good example of 
 a dragon piece -part of the           
 construction of a hipped roof. The key
 to the Moot Hall is kept at the P.O.  
 so that visitors to the village can   
 look at the exhibition. At present    
 there is,on exhibit, a painted panel  
 from the old Bower Hall, showing the  
 Old Hall.                             </content>
