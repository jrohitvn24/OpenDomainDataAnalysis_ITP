		<title>13RELIGION IN THE REGION</title>
		<content> THERE IS A DIVERSITY OF RELIGIOUS     
 BELIEF IN THE REGION, WITH A HISTORY  
 OF DISSENTION.  IN THE 16TH CENTURY 4 
 LOCAL PEOPLE WERE MARTYRED AS HERETICS
 FOR THEIR FAITH.                      
 THE MAIN RELIGIONS REPRESENTED ARE    
 CHURCH OF ENGLAND, ROMAN CATHOLIC, AND
 METHODIST, THE FIRST AND THE LAST     
 HAVING PARTICULARLY STRONG LOCAL TIES.
 NOT ALL VILLAGES NOW HAVE A CHURCH OF 
 SOME KIND BUT ANGLICAN CHURCHES CAN BE
 FOUND IN GREAT BENTLEY AND THORRINGTON
 WITH A METHODIST CHURCH IN GREAT      
 BENTLEY.  ROMAN CATHOLIC SERVICES ARE 
 HELD WEEKLY IN THE ANGLICAN CHURCH BY 
 ARRANGEMENT WITH THE CLERGY.  ALL     
 MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL CLERGY PLAY AN   
 EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART IN LOCAL     
 AFFAIRS. THE CHURCH SERVICES ARE WELL 
 ATTENDED BY YOUNG AND OLD, WITH MANY  
 FAMMILIES REPRESENTED.SUNDAY SCHOOL   
 PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART.              </content>
