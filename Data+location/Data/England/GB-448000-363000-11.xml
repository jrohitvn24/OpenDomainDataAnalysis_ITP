 a typical weekday in the life of their
 family. The family usually gets up at 
 7.30am. Each member washes, dresses   
 and prepares for the duties of the    
 day. Mrs. Layton, after breakfast,    
 catches the bus to New Houghton where 
 she works as an assistant in a food   
 market.Her husband, Frederick, who    
 works at the colliery in Shirebrook is
 collected by the N.C.B. bus at 8.3O.  
 Their only daughter Amanda aged       
 fourteen years goes to the local      
 Comprehensive school and catches the  
 bus at 8.3Oam, using her free pass and
 arrives at school at 8.5Oam.          
 In the evening Mrs. Layton arrives off
 the 4.3O bus. During the working day  
 Mrs. Layton would be helping to stock 
 up the shelves and ordering new stock 
 as well as working on the cashout     
 tills.                                </content>
