		<title>13Local Restaurants</title>
		<content> Near our school there is a variety of 
 restaurants,cafes and take away shops.
 From the Pond to Strathyre Ave. there 
 are 13 different establishments       
 selling food from all over the world. 
 2 Indian restaurants, 2 Kebab Take    
 Away shops,2 Greek restaurants, 1     
 Cantonese Restaurant, 1 Italian       
 restaurant, 1 Snack Bar, 1 Kentucky   
 Fried Chicken shop, 1 Fish and Chip   
 shop, 1 Indonesian Restaurant, 1 Wine 
 Bar. The Snack Bar opens at 8.00am and
 some of the restaurants close when the
 last customer leaves about 2.00am. The
 customers of the shops may be local   
 people or some may stop for a meal    
 while they are travelling. Other      
 people travel a long way to visit a   
 restaurant because they like the food.
 We think there cannot be many areas   
 where you could buy such a variety of 
 food within such a short distance.    </content>
