		<content> Most of the houses in the three       
 villages date from the 18th and 19th  
 century and are brick built. Some     
 replacement of property with modern   
 homes has been permitted although     
 there have been no modern estate      
 developments. Council houses are found
 in Egmanton and Laxton. In Egmanton 10
 council houses in Gaddick View are    
 well built and maintained. Curiosities
 in the villages include a timber built
 bungalow, a stone house and several   
 derelict properties.                  
    Manor houses have gone from both   
 villages and in Laxton the most       
 imposing house is the Old Vicarage. A 
 large neo-Georgian house is the most  
 noticable residence in Egmanton.      
    Many generations of the same       
 families still live within the        
 village. Newcomers are accepted and   
 contribute much to village life.      </content>
