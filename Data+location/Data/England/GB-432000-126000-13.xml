		<content> The principal habitats in our 'box'   
 are:                                  
 WOODLAND : Numerous woods remain, and 
 survey work by Hampshire County       
 Council has revealed that many of     
 these can be classified as ancient.   
 Traditional management (notably       
 coppicing) has all but died out,      
 leading to loss of diversity of       
 nesting sites and shading out of      
 ground flora.  DOWNLAND : Apart       
 from Brook Quarry none remains as far 
 as we are aware.                      
 WATERSIDE : No sizeable areas of      
 watermeadows or grazing meadows remain
 untampered with, although it is       
 possible to find some quite good      
 flora. The Test itself is virtually   
 inaccessible to the public. The valley
 has a good barn owl population.       
 The best overall stretch is the Test  
 Way: nightingales, other warblers.    </content>
