		<title>10TEENAGE LIFE - LITTLE WITLEY</title>
		<content>{  My weekend}is very busy but at the  
 end of it not much seems to have been 
 done. On{Saturday morning}Mum and I   
 usually go shopping. If we are in the 
 vicinity we meet Dad and Stephen for  
 lunch after they have played golf.    
{Saturday evening}usually means        
 visiting friends or relations, or     
 being visited which I enjoy, on the   
 whole.                                
  {Sunday}entails going to church. Then
 I will clean the rabbit's hutch and   
 afterwards, my bedroom. During the    
 weekend I also have to get my college 
 homework done and also clarinet and   
 piano practice. I usually help Mum    
 with the housework and dinners because
 she also has better things to do. We  
 sometimes walk in the apple orchards, 
 depending on the weather.             
   I go to bed early on Sunday ready   
 for yet another week. Helen Preece.   </content>
