		<content> Our 12 kilometre square is situated to
 the south of the{City of Bradford.}The
 area can be divided into two by a line
 following the A6036 from West to East 
 across the "block".The northern half  
 is situated on a north facing slope   
 looking across the City of Bradford.  
 This part of area is occupied mainly  
 by residential property of various    
 types and light industry. The southern
 half of the "block" is situated on a  
 south facing slope and consists mainly
 of residential property, farmland and 
 two golf courses. The M606, which runs
 in a southerly direction from the     
 A6036, is Bradford's only link with   
 the national{Motorway system}via the  
 M62. The A6030 forms part of the      
 Bradford Ring Road and two other      
 important roads pass through our area 
 going to{Wakefield, Halifax and}
