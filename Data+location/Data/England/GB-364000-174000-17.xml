		<title>17Churches in Kingswood.</title>
		<content>   There are 21{churches}in the        
 Kingswood area. 6 of these churches   
 are of the{Methodist Faith.}The       
 reasons for the large number of       
 Methodist Churches are historical. The
 area was once a{coalfield.}In{1673}73 
 small pits were being worked in the   
 Kingswoood coalfield but by 1723 the  
 number had doubled. The Kingswood     
 coalfield acquired a notorious        
 reputation. It attracted the rougher  
 elements of society and the area was  
 neglected by the clergy of the{Church 
{of England.                           
  {George Whitfield,}an Anglican       
 minister, and, later on,{John Wesley, 
 changed this situation. The two men   
 preached, often from horseback,to     
 crowds of colliers 200 t0 300 strong. 
 They led a{religious revival}which    
 resulted in the large number of       
{Methodist Churches}in Kingswood.      </content>
