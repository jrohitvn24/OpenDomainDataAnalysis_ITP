		<title>13 THE ROEBANK ARCADE</title>
		<content>     The Roebank Arcade is a covered   
 block of shops on the Bransholme      
 Estate in Hull. At first they were the
 only shops on the estate, but now     
 there is a large shopping centre one  
 kilometre away.                       
                                       
    A survey of people using the arcade
 was made on a Tuesday morning and a   
 Friday afternoon.                     
                                       
    The newsagent had the busiest shop 
 at both times. The baker was busier on
 Tuesday morning, but most other shops 
 were busier on Friday afternoon,      
 particularily the estate office where 
 rents are paid, and the greengrocer.  
 Almost all the c ustomers lived       
 nearby, and many older people used the
 arcade because it was nearer their    
 homes.                                
                                       </content>
