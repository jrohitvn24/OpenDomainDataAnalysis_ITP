		<title>01STROOD AND ROCHESTER</title>
		<content> Strood is on the edge of the Medway   
Towns, separated by the River Medway   
and Rochester Bridge from historic     
Rochester.                             
                                       
  Industry in Strood is declining with 
the recession and in 1985 there are    
many either unemployed or commuting to 
London for work.                       
                                       
  Rochester has been developed into a  
tourist attraction.  During the summer 
many people can be seen walking the    
attractively paved High Street visiting
such places as the Charles Dickens     
Centre, the Castle and the Cathedral.  
                                       
  With the closing of Chatham Dockyard 
the river has lost some of its         
importance but trade and industry still
still use it along with sailing boats  
and pleasure craft.  By Julie Harris   </content>
