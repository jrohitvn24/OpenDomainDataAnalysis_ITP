		<title>15Keeping Sheep at School</title>
		<content>    We keep sheep at{Andrews' Endowed  
{Primary School,}Holybourne.           
    We have two black{Welsh Mountain   
{Sheep}ewes which we call{'Sooty'}and  
{'Sweep'}which live in paddocks at the 
 back of our school.                   
    In the autumn, about the beginning 
 of November, we borrow a ram from a   
 local farm to{'tup'}Sooty and Sweep so
 that they can have lambs in the       
 springtime. This year they each had   
 twin ram lambs, which we will keep    
 until we sell them to a farm in       
 December.  The money that we get from 
 selling the lambs helps to pay for all
 the food and equipment that we have to
 buy each year for the sheep.          
    Each summer all our sheep have to  
 be{dipped}twice to help keep them     
 healthy.  We save the{fleeces}that we 
 get when the sheep are shorn, so that 
 we can learn to spin wool and weave.  </content>
