		<content> Three stone coffin covers,probably    
 dating from the fourteenth century    
 have been built into the outside of   
 the north wall of the nave.A fourth is
 on the west wall of the Berkeley      
 Chapel.They are all difficult to spot 
 at first.The three are quite high and 
 they show no signs of decoration.     
 However,the fourth has been the       
 subject of careful and elaborate      
 carving depicting a triple cross.The  
 erosion of six centuries has been hard
 on the coffin covers.Time has taken   
 its toll.
