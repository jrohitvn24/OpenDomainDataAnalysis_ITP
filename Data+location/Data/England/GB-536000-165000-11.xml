		<title>11Living in Beckenham</title>
		<content>   Where I used to live there was a lot
of lovely countryside.When we came here
I thought I would hate the rush and    
noise of the big city, but over the    
years I have got used to the traffic. I
would prefer to live in Barry in Wales,
but you can't have everything. The     
things I miss are good clubs and acti- 
vities. In Barry there was always some-
thing to join. When I speak to my grand
parents on the phone they keep telling 
me off for losing my Welsh accent. We  
now have a much better house with      
double glazing and central heating     
which we never dreamed of having be-   
fore. My Dad has a much better paid job
and it is much more stable. The school 
I now go to, Marian Vian, is much more 
modern with a large field,a large play-
ground and an outdoor pool. Beckenham  
is a nice area to live in.
