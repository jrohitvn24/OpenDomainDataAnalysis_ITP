 Situated next to its former site on   
 the airfield, the museum was started  
 by enthusiasts from Sunderland Flying 
 Club.  With money raised, donations   
 and help from local firms, old        
 aircraft were bought and others       
 donated.  Renovation work is carried  
 out by members in their spare time.   
 The museum is run as a non-profit     
 making organization, charging a       
 minimal entry fee.  To-day it houses  
 a number of jet aircraft, helicopters 
 and vehicles with a Vulcan bomber the 
 centre piece of the display.
