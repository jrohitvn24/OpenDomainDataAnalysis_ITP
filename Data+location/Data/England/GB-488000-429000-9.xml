		<title>09RELIGION - ALL SAINTS CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The church in South Cave is        
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book.  The vicar of All Saints Church 
 is The Rev. Shimwell.                 
    The first church on this site was  
 built before 1081 and there are still 
 remains of a Saxon wall in the south  
 wall of the nave.  There is a Saxon   
 font in the church.                   
    In the 13th century the church was 
 rebuilt because it was in poor        
 condition.  There was a fire in the   
 16th century.                         
    The Faxfleet aisle was built in    
 1633, the money came from Henry       
 Garway. He later became Lord Mayor of 
 London. Mrs. Barnard donated the money
 for the timbered roof of the church.  
 The Barnards did  a lot for the       
 villagers.
