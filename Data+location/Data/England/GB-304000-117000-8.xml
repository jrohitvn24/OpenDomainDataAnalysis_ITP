		<title>08HOLCOMBE COURT</title>
		<content> Holcombe Court is a most interesting  
 old Elizabethan house which is in     
 Holcombe Rogus at the other end of the
 main street from our school.          
 For many centuries it was owned by the
 Bluett family.They sold it to the     
 Fleetwood-Hesketh's who stayed here   
 for most of this century.It was then  
 sold to Colonel and Mrs.P.Dobree,who  
 have been here for about 5 years.They 
 have made it very nice indeed.It is   
 not open to the public but they       
 invited the children from our school  
 to come.We made a Video there set in  
 Elizabethan times.Every child in the  
 school was in the film.It won us a    
 prize in the Devon Schools Video      
 competition.
