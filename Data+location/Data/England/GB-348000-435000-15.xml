		<content>The St Mary's chess club meets each    
Monday lunchtime. We play matches      
against many of the schools in the     
Preston area and win some of them even 
though most of the schools have 4 or 5 
times as many pupils.                  
                                       
The football, skittleball and rounders 
teams play in matches and rallies in   
both the Preston and Garstang areas.   
                                       
In the last two years we have also     
competed in swimming galas, cricket    
matches and athletics meetings.        
                                       
There are many certificates on the wall
of the entrance hall for the events in 
which we have been successful. Even    
when we do not win we enjoy taking     
part.
