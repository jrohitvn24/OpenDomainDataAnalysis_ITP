		<title>13Home life in Charnwood 1</title>
		<content> The retired owner of{Whitcroft}a large
 cottage surrounded by garden,10acres  
 of woodland &amp; paddock regards himself 
 as poor,struggling on a fixed income  
 to keep up the standard of a Country  
 Gent. Powered tools help him to cope  
 with the land.Two cars mean he and his
 wife can pursue their own interests,  
 his being shooting and local country  
 sporting events.                      
 The M1 separated the{Lodge}from Bardon
 Hall and it is now owned by a Wood    
 Sculptor whose work is a delight. This
 retired gentleman and his wife love   
 gardening growing their own fruit and 
 vegetables.Until recently collected   
 rain water and a bore hole in the     
 garden was their only water           
 supply.They like the privacy of living
 in the country and are interested in  
 its conservation but they need their  
 car to complete their lives.          </content>
