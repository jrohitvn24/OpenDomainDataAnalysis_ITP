		<content> South Kyme is a small village set in a
 large, productive arable farming area.
 Farming dominates the work and quiet  
 life style of the community.          
  The village is isolated; the nearest 
 small town being Sleaford (9miles).   
 Built beside the site of the old abbey
 and tower, it is divided by the Kyme  
 Eau river (River Slea). One hump back 
 bridge remains, a legacy from days    
 when crops were transported by river. 
  There are very few amenities in the  
 village, which is by no means self    
 sufficient. There is one pub, one     
 shop/Post Office, a village hall,     
 chapel, and church. The community was 
 wounded when the village primary      
 school was closed, in 1984.           
  Some members of long-standing, local 
 families reside here, but there are   
 several newcomers who commute to work,
 or who have retired in the village.   </content>
