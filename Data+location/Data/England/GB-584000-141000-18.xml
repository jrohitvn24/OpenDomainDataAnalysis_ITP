		<content> In this rural area where most houses  
 have at least a small plot of land,   
 gardening is a popular hobby and often
 leads to bee-keeping, wine or cider   
 making. The river encourages fishing, 
 and the attractive landscape amateur  
 artists and photographers. People with
 small paddocks keep a few sheep and   
 spinning, weaving and knitting follow.
 Some ladies spend happy hours making  
 tapestry kneelers for the church and  
 others use their skills in            
 dressmaking. Walking, jogging, cycling
 and horse riding are also popular. On 
 the farms shooting keeps down wood    
 pigeons and rabbits; clay pigeon      
 shooting is practised and one local   
 man is a national champion shot.      
 Cricket and tennis in summer and      
 football and hockey in winter are the 
 main sports available in the village.
