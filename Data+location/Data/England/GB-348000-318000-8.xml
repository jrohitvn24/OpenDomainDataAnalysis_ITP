		<title>08JAMES'SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>      I get to school at about 8.45 and
 go in to get the whistle.It is my job 
 to blow the whistle and ring the bell 
 at playtimes and dinner time.         
      At 9.00 I blow the whistle and we
 go in to start 'DD'.Mr. Hurrell calls 
 the register then we mark 'DD', I     
 usually get 9 or 10.We then do core   
 maths or language until assembly      
 time.Mrs.Sampson's class took assembly
 today, they did about Moses and the   
 10 commandments. After break I started
 writing this for the Domesday Survey. 
      It was games on the field after  
 dinner.We had scoring rounders,{      
{Supersquad }against{Hotshots. }I play 
 for Hotshots and we won {48 - 35.     
      After break I carried on writing 
 this until I rung the bell for        
 hometime at 3.45.
