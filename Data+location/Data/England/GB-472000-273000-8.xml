		<title>08LAMPORT HALL Kitchens</title>
		<content>We went into the kitchens which were   
very big and up the servants stairs(50 
steps)because servants were not allowed
up the front stairs and they had to    
carry coal and hot water upstairs and  
they had to carry chamber pots down,   
just think what would happen if you    
fell.There aren't servants now and     
everybody has bathrooms and central    
heating so you don't need servants to  
carry everything.                      
  There are lots of interesting things 
to see at Lamport.                     
There is a badger set in one of the    
woods.We didn't see any badgers but we 
knew they were there because we found  
droppings near a hole.                 
                                       
Lamport Hall is open to the public on  
Sundays and Bank Holidays.
