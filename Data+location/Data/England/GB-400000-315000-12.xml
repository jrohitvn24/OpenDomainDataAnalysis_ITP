 {Slitting Mill} is just over 1 mile   
S.W. of{Rugeley} on the edge of        
Cannock Chase.The village got its name 
from the{ Rolling and Slitting Mill}   
which was working in the 17th and 18th 
centuries.{Slitting Mill Waterworks,}  
which pumps over 1 million gallons of  
water a day from 200 feet below ground,
is now on the site of the old slitting 
mill.                                  
  The village is small and quiet.There 
is a school which will soon be         
closed, a small church, a public house 
and a post office store, together with 
some old and new housing.              
  There are beautiful{walks} by the    
Horn's Pool, following the Rising      
Brook. Along the stream the remains of 
dams and pools, which were created to  
drive the mill wheels, may be seen by  
observant walkers.                     </content>
