		<title>13A Day at Tregolls School</title>
		<content> We have to be at school by 8.50 and   
 we go into assembly at about 9.05.We  
 have a special way into our school    
 where no cars can go to make it safer 
 for us and it is marked with a yellow 
 line.My first lesson is Maths.and     
 usually after playtime we have some   
 kind of English like Topics or Cloze  
 work or Spelling.On Tuesday afternoon 
 we have Games a like cricket or       
 rounders.I am captain of the cricket  
 team and we haven't lost a match for 5
 years.When we come in from the field  
 at about 2.15 we have another lesson  
 like handwriting and poetry and we    
 finish at 3.30.Mr. Lloyd takes us for 
 cricket or football practice after    
 school.One of my favourite lessons is 
 Science.This year we built sand       
 yachts,mangonels and ballistas.Last   
 year they built a big go-cart.I like  
 my school,it's great.                 </content>
