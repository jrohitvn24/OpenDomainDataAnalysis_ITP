		<title>15Hinwick House</title>
		<content>   The house was begun in l706 and     
 completed by l710.  It cost Â£3,848. It
 was built of local stone dug out of   
 the cellars and from the local stone  
 pit.  The oak timber used came from   
 local plantations.                    
   During the First World War the house
 was used as a convalescent home.      
   Today it stands as an example of    
 Queen Anne architecture and is still  
 lived in by the Orlebar family.  Tours
 of the house can be made by           
 arrangement and meals can also be     
 arranged.                             
   At the house there is an exhibition 
 of fashion and objets d'arts dating   
 from the early l8th century to the    
 l950's.  There are also some fine     
 examples of local lace on display.
