		<title>07Canvey - The Lake (2)</title>
		<content>   The lake is generally supposed to   
 have been an old creek dating from the
 time when{Canvey Island}was a         
 collection of smaller islands before  
 embankment. It was cut off from the   
 sea by the Knightswick Road part of an
 old sea wall but now it is a          
 freshwater lake. Remains of old       
 oyster shells have been dredged up    
 from its depths, a reminder of what   
 the lake was probably used for in     
 Roman times.                          
   The lake is three quarters of a mile
 in length and a long curved narrow    
 shape. people cross the lake by snakes
 bridge at the western end. The lake   
 has extensive reed and rush growth    
 along its margin and provides haven   
 for wild life in its inaccessible     
 parts.The muddy clay bottom is 5m.    
 deep in parts.The water is shallow -  
 only about 0.5m.                      </content>
