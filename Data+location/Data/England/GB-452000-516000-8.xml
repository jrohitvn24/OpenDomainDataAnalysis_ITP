		<content>{Computers} became more popular in     
 l983, when the number of people       
 increased rapidly. Seventy children   
 in our school have home computers     
 used mainly for games. The most       
 popular is the{ZX Spectrum}possibly   
 because it has a wide range of games  
 and is easy to operate. The least     
 popular are the{Oric}and the{Aquarius 
 possibly because they are more        
 expensive and haven's got as wide a   
 range of games as the{Spectrum.

 Very few of the adults we interviewed 
 use a computer in their work. The ones
 who do, use them for storing          
 information.                          
                                       
 Our school has three computers. The   
 Disc Drive for the BBC is an          
 economical way to load programs.
