		<content>   The village of{Burtonwood}and the   
 surrounding area have several         
 different styles of housing.          
   Many of the old{farm houses}are now 
 privately owned and the farm land has 
 been taken over by{Warrington New Town
{Development,}the projected use of this
 land being for{housing}and{employment.
   Within the village itself are a few 
 renovated{cottages}but apart from that
 the housing can be split into two main
 catagories. There is a large{council  
{house estate}of mainly traditional{   
{semi-detached houses}with gardens to  
 the front and back.                   
   There are a few streets of{privately
{owned terraced houses}although the    
 bulk of the private housing is a new  
 estate of{houses}and{bungalows}       
 incorporating{detached}and{semi-      
{detached}residences.
