		<title>16BARNWELL PARK - GENERAL</title>
		<content> Barnwell park lies just outside of    
{Oundle}along the A605. Barnwell Park  
 consists of trees and vegetation,     
 animals and birds.There are rivers and
 lakes where you can go fishing. Also  
 there are disabled fishing areas.There
 are picnic areas eg tables and        
 benches in different places around the
 park.There are toilets as you come    
 through the gate.Barnwell Park is very
 interesting but it does have some     
 drawbacks like there could be more    
 signs put up around the park to show  
 you the different animals and         
 places, and when it has rained the    
 paths are very muddy. Its advantages  
 are that there are disabled fishing   
 points. There are bird watching hides 
 if you are a bird watcher.
