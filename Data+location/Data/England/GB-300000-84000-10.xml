		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content> There are six farms in our area, none 
 of them bigger than 125 hectares.The  
 farms are all mainly dairy and own    
 from 110 to 150 cattle (mainly        
 Friesian or Friesian crossed with     
 Holstein) and 1 farm owned 12 beef    
 cattle.The milk production per cow,   
 per day is around 18 litres.          
 Some farms grow arable crops in       
 addition to silage for winter fodder. 
 One farm also grows maize as fodder   
 and another grows winter barley which 
 he sells.                             
 The farms all employed under 5 people 
 but only one employed no people.This  
 is partly because the farms in the    
 area are small and partly because the 
 area is highly mechanised.            
 The farms making the most money are   
 the ones adopting to change. This     
 changing has now become particularly  
 noticable since the EEC (cont on p.11)</content>
