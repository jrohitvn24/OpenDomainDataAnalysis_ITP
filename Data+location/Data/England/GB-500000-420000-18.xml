    A mini album entitled "Underglass" 
 has been released by three Barton     
 teenagers,namely,Kim Appleyard,Theresa
 Kemp and Clare Pearson.It is their    
 first recording made and sounds as if 
 it could be a sucess."Underglass" is  
 available from Pegasus Records,a new  
 shop opened on Fleetgate,Barton.      
   The group may be helped by the fact 
 that Theresa's father is a member of  
 the well known folk group "Steeleye   
 Span"
