		<title>02WEST BECKTON WALK (1)</title>
		<content>        On a warm afternoon the        
 domesday project group went out for a 
 walk round the West Beckton Area.     
 We looked at all the new houses.      
 Before thw houses were built there    
 were ditches across the marsh land.   
 This was used for grazing cattle up to
 Victorian times. There were lots of   
 new houses in Stansfield Road. There  
 was a dead-end called Alison Road with
 men building new houses. On the left  
 hand-side of Stansfield Road was a    
 golf course. Then we walked further up
 Stansfield Road to see the horses. The
 gates of the horses field were not    
 open because the horses were wild. We 
 looked behind the fence on the corner 
 of Stansfield Road. And there were    
 more workmen biulding more houses. We 
 then went back to school.
