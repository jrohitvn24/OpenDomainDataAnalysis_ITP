{Hill does exert considerable influence
 over the village.                     
   Many villagers use the hill for     
 exercise, and some visitors even hang 
 glide from the top.                   
   One villager is reputed to have been
 murdered on the hill in 1945 in a     
 ritual killing. The murder was not    
 solved.                               
   Local legend has it that elements of
 the supernatural are still active on  
 the hill.                             
   Traditionally,the village celebrates
{May Day, }although this is currently  
 centred around the school.            
   The{Harvest Festival}brings most    
 of the village to the church and      
 includes a harvest supper, which leads
 to a donation to the starving of the  
 world.
