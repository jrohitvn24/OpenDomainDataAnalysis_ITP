		<content> The general trend in unemployment in  
 the Soulbury/Linslade area is well    
 below the national average.           
 As the area is a commuter belt, many  
 people in Linslade and the surrounding
 villages go to London, Milton Keynes  
 and the other larger towns with good  
 motorway and rail links. Many women,  
 however, especially married women,    
 seek part-time employment locally in  
 light industry, shops and offices in  
 the area.                             
 There is very little"Apprentice" style
 training of the old kind available    
 locally and the need appears to be for
 highly skilled people.                
 Industrial dispute is virtually       
 non-existent as most people work in   
 small units, offices or family run    
 shops, where any disputes can be      
 settled at grass-root level, without  
 the need for unions or Arbitration.   </content>
