		<content>{LINE TIG.}Any number can play. One    
 person is on and tries to tig you     
 while you and he are running on the   
 lines. If you go off you are out.     
{STUCK IN THE MUD.}You need about six  
 people, and one or two people are on. 
 If one person tigs you, you have to   
 stand with your legs apart and arms   
 up. To be freed someone crawls between
 your legs.                            
{ELASTICS.}You need a length of elastic
 tied and held around two children's   
 legs. People jump in, out, and on the 
 elastic. This is the chant "Big Ben   
 strikes ten, inside, outside, inside, 
 on".                                  
{BULLDOG.}Everyone stands in a line,   
 one person is on and calls out the    
 name of someone, who runs across the  
 playground, chased by the person who  
 is on. If "Bulldog" is called everyone
 must run.                             </content>
