		<content>To the N.E.of Kidsgrove our area is on 
the very edge of the Pennine foothills 
and underlain by Productive Coal       
Measure beds except for an outcrop of  
Millstone Grit at Mount Pleasant ending
the Mow Cop ridge.Farming is mainly    
restricted to grazing land due to the  
poor soil and undulating land which is 
cut by numerous small streams in quite 
deep valleys,making it easy to mine the
coal at or near the surface,using      
opencast and footrail methods in       
addition to deep mining.Many shafts and
derelict areas are to be found         
including a large pit bank N.W.of      
Brindley Ford.Settlements arising from 
mining dominate the area.Firstly as    
ribbon development along the lanes,and 
then miners estates.As mining declines 
recent building arises from movement   
out of the Potteries.
