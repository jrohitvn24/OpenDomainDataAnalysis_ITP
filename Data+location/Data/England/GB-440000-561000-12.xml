		<content>    There is a variety of youth clubs  
 linked to the schools or churches,    
 where children can take part in       
 sporting or recreational activities.  
 Further social activities, for all    
 ages, are linked to the four churches 
 in Whitburn.                          
     The area has several sports       
 fields, both private and public, where
 many activites can be pursued.        
    Cornthwaite Park, which is         
 triangular in shape, offers bowling,  
 tennis, putting greens, as well as    
 children's play areas, ponds and a one
 mile public footpath to the coast. It 
 also provides car parking facilities. 
    There is a Branch Library in the   
 village centre - part of South        
 Tyneside Libraries, and the service is
 well used.
