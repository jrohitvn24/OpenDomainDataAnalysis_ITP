		<title>20Toppesfield Pump</title>
		<content> The village pump, which stands in the 
 centre of the carriageway at the main 
 road junction in Toppesfield, is an   
 attractive local feature. There are   
 actually two pumps and the larger one 
 was still in use as the main source of
 water supply in Toppesfield as late as
 1952 when mains water was installed.  
 The well beneath the pumps was filled 
 daily with water pumped from a spring 
 in the valley south of Church Farm.   
 Just as the pump was a traditional    
 meeting place in earlier times when   
 people gathered to draw water each day
 so it is still a focal point where    
 young people congregate and older     
 people wait for the occasional bus    
 which passes through the village. The 
 pump was roofed earlier this century  
 and a bench seat was recently provided
 alongside it.                         
                                       </content>
