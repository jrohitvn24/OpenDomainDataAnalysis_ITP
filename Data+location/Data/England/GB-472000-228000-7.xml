		<title>07 Pests on Furzen Farm</title>
		<content> On the farm on the Addington Estate   
they suffer from pests.The pests they  
mainly get are rooks,pigeons, aphids   
and leatherjackets which turn into     
daddy longlegs.One year they sprayed   
the daddy longlegs.They found out that 
there were approximately five million  
leatherjackets per acre and they have  
one thousand and thirty two acres!     
 The pigeons eat the corn when it has  
just been sown. The rooks eat the corn 
 when it comes up.The aphids and       
leatherjackets get on the barley.      
  The pests are not all living         
creatures.There are some fungal        
diseases like mildew.                  
 To kill off these pests, the farmer   
can spray for insects and fungal       
disease. At the farm they shoot        
pigeons,rooks and rabbits.
