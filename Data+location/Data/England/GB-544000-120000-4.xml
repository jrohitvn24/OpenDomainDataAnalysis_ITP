		<title>04THE MAYOR OF UCKFIELD.</title>
		<content>    The Mayor and his 17 councillors   
 have their meetings at{Wealden Lodge} 
 which has recently replaced the Town  
 Hall(used as a magistrates court). We 
 met{Mr Foster},the 7th Mayor here to  
 ask him questions about his job and   
 the town, for the project.            
    Mr Foster likes being the Mayor,   
 particularly planning for the future  
 of the town. In the next ten years the
{population}will{increase by 50%}and   
 planning for these people takes up a  
 lot of his time.The council are going 
 to build a covered swimming pool,3 BMX
 tracks,an indoor market, a primary    
 school,a playing field and homes and  
 shops for the new people.             
    When Mr Foster attends town        
 functions like carnivals and opening  
 new places, he wears the Chain of     
 Office.It is insured for Â£10000.      
 Mr Foster enjoys living in Uckfield.  </content>
