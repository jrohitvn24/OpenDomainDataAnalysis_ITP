		<content> There are two rivers which flow       
 through our block. Both are small but 
 the larger is the River Wheelock and  
 it was this that we took a closer look
 at. It enters the block from the south
 having risen at Mow Cop and flows     
 northwards. Beyond the block it flows 
 into the River Dane. The stretch of   
 the river within the block measures 7 
 km. We chose a field just to the north
 of Sutton Mill to carry out our study.
 We found that it had an average depth 
 of 0.5 metres and the average width   
 was 7 metres. The speed of flow varied
 so we measured it at three points and 
 calculated the average flow speed to  
 be 27 metres per minute. We estimated 
 from these measurements that the      
 average volume of water flowing was 93
 cubic metres per minute.
