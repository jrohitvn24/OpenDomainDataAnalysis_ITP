		<content>  n 1980 at Pot Kiln School,the water  
 in he swimming pool kept disappearing.
This was because of a big crack in the 
bottom of the pool,so they filled it up
but an even bigger crack appeared.The  
water ran away again so they gave it up
again.We came out to play on our       
playground and found that it had dipped
in the middle.We were taken in and the 
council were called and they came and  
drilled holes in the ground and lowered
small cameras down.They found some     
disused chalk mines underneath which   
had to be filled up so some of the     
school were moved into Wells Hall Old  
School.The holes took about a year to  
be filled and now it is all finished   
and is safe.
