		<title>19MILDENHALL PAST AND PRESENT</title>
		<content>  The{census records}show that most of 
 the jobs in 1881 in Mildenhall were to
 do with{farming.}Things like plough   
 boys, labourers and shepherds were the
 most common jobs.Also we noticed that 
 when a man was a labourer his children
 tended to take up the same occupation.
 There were also some{craftsmen}such as
 carpenters, and some servants.Most    
 people worked in the same area where  
 they were born.                       
  In contrast, many people in          
 Mildenhall now{travel}away from the   
 village to work.Locally, there are    
 also more varied jobs available.The   
 farm-workers require different skills 
 to work the modern machinery, and     
 there are also other{local industries 
 providing jobs.
