		<content> Comparatively few people live in this 
 area: the{population}does not exceed  
 60. There are{twenty-four households  
 of between one and five persons. Four 
 couples are elderly and two younger   
 couples live here. The majority of    
 people are middle aged. Of the eight  
{children}of school age, two are being 
 educated privately and live away      
 during termtime. Eight sons and       
 daughters of working age live with    
 their parents. Most{adolescents}feel  
 that they will leave the area when    
 they get married. All men of working  
 age in the area are in employment. One
 works only three days a week. He would
 like to work full time but would lose 
 too much of his pension in tax. Only  
 two wives are at work. Three men have 
 retired. The other men work on the    
 farms (including four managers) or at 
 Seaman's Animal Feeds Mill.           </content>
