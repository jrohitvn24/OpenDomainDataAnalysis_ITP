		<content> I wake up at 7.00 and I get dressed.  
 At 8.20 I leave home to go down to the
 bus by the village hall. Mr Devine    
 drives the bus most mornings. I have  
 one hamster and two rabbits. I feed   
 them every morning and at night time. 
 They are called Buffy, Starlight and  
 Hazel. At school we go swimming at    
 Warminster and we do art and craft. We
 sing with Mrs George. We go to        
 swimming club on Monday nights if we  
 want to. I go because it is great fun.
 We get back at about 5.00pm. When I   
 get home from school I sometimes watch
 T.V. or I go up to the field behind   
 the house where I live. Cows usually  
 graze in the field. I have made a den 
 by the field. There is some wire which
 you go through and my den is on the   
 side of a chalk pit. I take my friends
 up there.
