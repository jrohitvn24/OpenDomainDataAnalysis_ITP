		<title>07Employment in Maltby</title>
		<content> The major employer is the National    
 Coal Board who employ 1600 workers at 
 Maltby colliery. There is other       
 employment in tool and clothing       
 factories,a brickworks and limestone  
 quarries. There are also jobs in      
 services, such as education,retail    
 trade and personal services.          
 Unemployment has increased greatly    
 over the last decade:-1975 5%,1980 12%
 and 1985 20%. Thus unemployment is a  
 major problem, especially for school  
 leavers.                              
 During the miners strike of 1984/5 a  
 significant proportion of the working 
 population were thus either on strike 
 or unemployed. This had serious       
 consequences for local trade and a    
 number of shops and businesses were   
 forced to close.
