		<title>16GOVERNMENT IN FRILSHAM</title>
		<content> People in Frilsham are{law abiding.   
 There is very little vandalism. What  
 there is could be the work of         
 youngsters from outside the area.     
 There are few problems for their      
 policeman who comes from Bucklebury   
 and drives round in a patrol car. The 
{Parish Council}has 6 members and meets
 bi-monthly in the village hall. The   
 chairman is often a farmer as befits a
 predominately farming community.      
 Associated with it are two{charities  
 administered by councillors.  The     
 Dean Pocock Charity provides 40       
 parcels at Christmas for elderly      
 residents. The Haywards Charity  gives
 money for books and education. These  
 monies are derived from legacies      
 made by former residents of           
 Frilsham.The Parish Council meets no  
 serious problems. Today's MP is a     
 member of the Conservative party.     </content>
