		<content> There are not many open play areas for
 children. Much of the traditional     
 'rough' groung has been taken for     
 housing development.                  
 ELEVEN TO SIXTEEN                     
 All children go to the local          
 comprehensive school. A youth club    
 operates one evening a week. Scouts   
 and Guides are available to these     
 children also. There are few other    
 facilities for children of this age.  
 The play area has become a meeting    
 place for some.                       
 ADULTHOOD                             
 Much of the Social life operates      
 around the workplace. Many of the     
 residents work for the C.E.G.B and the
 Coal Board and have access to social  
 events there. Once again, apart from  
 the usual Young Wives associated with 
 the church and the W.I, there is      
 little to do locally.                 </content>
