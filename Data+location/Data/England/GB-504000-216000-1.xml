              {MARKYATE}               
 Markyate is a small village of about  
 3000 people situated in the country   
 in north Hertfordshire about 35 miles 
 north of London.A lot of the land     
 surrounding Markyate is used for      
 farming.In the summer the fields are  
 an array of colour which makes it     
 look very picturesque. In the winter  
 the fields freeze over and the village
 often gets snowed up.When the warm    
 summer returns the village gets back  
 to its normal routine with the noise  
 and bustle of traffic travelling along
 the A5 which is a main road that      
 follows the old Roman Road from London
 to Chester,known as{WATLING STREET.   
 Just on the edge of the village there 
 is a church and past that there is the
{MARKYATE CELL,}a Manor House, which   
 dates back to the 15th Century.       </content>
