		<title>15CLANNABOROUGH CHURCH</title>
		<content>     Clannaborough Church is dedicated 
 to St Petrock; this, together with the
 circular churchyard on the line of a  
 pre-Christian trackway, indicates that
 the church was a very early one built 
 on a pagan site.  The present church  
 is partly Norman, with a simple nave  
 and tower.  The rectors date from     
 1272.  In the last century it fell    
 into poor repair, and was             
 substantially refurbished by Mrs      
 Wreford in 1858-9.                    
    In the 50 years up to 1936, when a 
 carillon of 8 bells was installed,    
 only 2 parishioners, a Rector and his 
 wife, had been buried in the church-  
 yard, and only 8 parishioners married,
 but many people from Copplestone      
 have been married or buried there.    
    The church is now incorporated into
 the North Creedy team ministry, and   
 the vicar is the Rev. Shillingford.   </content>
