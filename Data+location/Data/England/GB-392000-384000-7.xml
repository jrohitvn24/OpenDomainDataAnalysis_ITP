		<content>    The biggest farm in our area is    
{Towers Farm}covering some 250 acres.  
 The current owner is Mr.Wainwright.   
 He is a dairy farmer and has 60-70    
 cows on 250 acres. It is mostly       
 pasture, though he also grows fodder  
 beet.  His cows are{Holsteins,}a      
 Friesian breed, which are good        
 milkers.  Each cow's milk yield is    
 6,000 litres per year. When the cows  
 are seven or eight years old they are 
 sent off to be slaughtered.           
 Mr.Wainwright's main markets are      
{Bakewell and Congleton.}He has two    
 people working on the farm with him.  
   {New House farm}covers 170 acres on

 housing The farmer's land is covered  
 with old Mine shafts and trackways    
 which causes many problems.           </content>
