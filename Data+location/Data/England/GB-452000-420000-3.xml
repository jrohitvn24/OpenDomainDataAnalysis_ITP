		<title>03FOCUS ON M62 MOTORWAY (2)</title>
		<content> Before the M62 Motorway was built, the
 motorists had to  use longer routes,  
 mainly the "A"roads to travel.        
 However, another form of transport    
 which was very popular in the early   
 years, was by Barge,along the Aire and
 Calder Navigation.                    
 This leaves the River Aire at         
 Knottingley and practically runs along
 side the M62 through Whitley Bridge.  
 This form of transport is rarely used 
 now.                                  
 Another road which has recently been  
 built to cut the numbers of drivers   
 using the small streets of the        
 village, is the by pass which joins   
 the M62 to the A19.                   
 The people in the village  say that   
 the by-pass is a good thing, as local 
 traffic is a lot quieter since it has 
 been built.                           
                                       </content>
