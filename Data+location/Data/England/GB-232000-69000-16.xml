		<title>16Nursery Unit</title>
		<content>     The{Nursery}has got spades,       
 buckets etc.                          
     The best thing there is the       
 wood work things because you can buy  
 saws and hammers and nails. I could   
 not use them when I was little because
 they are dangerous.                   
     The most dangerous thing there is 
{sand pit}because the sand can get in  
 peoples' eyes. My cousin goes to the  
 nursery unit, he is 3 years old. He   
 lives in Callington, down the road    
 from us.                              
                                       
     There are some{plastic building   
{blocks}that they play with and kick   
 down. They have got a{play kitchen}and
 also a real one. My cousins favourite 
 subject is painting because it is     
 messy and hot, absorbing and          
 interesting.
