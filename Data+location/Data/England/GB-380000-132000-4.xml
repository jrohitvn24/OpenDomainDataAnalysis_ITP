 The Mere lynchets are still there, a  
 bit reduced, less productive, but     
 still there.   These saxon  strip     
 fields are narrow ledges cut into the 
 side of the hills either side of the  
 hand-shaped combes running north into 
 Mere Down a mile east of Mere.        
 There are between five and six grassy 
 levelled strips along the lower slope 
 of each combe and are best seen in the
 low winter sun.   Varying in width    
 from four to nine metres, the         
 different levels are still joined by  
 ramps.   The high saxon fields at the 
 head of the main valley have now      
 really gone, though the outlines are  
 just discernable.   Where they were   
 ploughed and rotated they are now     
 occasionally grazed by sheep.   There 
 are fewer downland wild flowers but   
 several species of orchid survive.    </content>
