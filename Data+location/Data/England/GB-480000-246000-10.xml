		<title>10HANSLOPE CHURCH TOWER TRIP</title>
		<content>When we got through the gates of       
Hanslope church we were very eager to  
get up the tower.Then Mr. Brookes      
sorted us into 5 groups.While the      
first group was up there I drew the    
church.When they had come down it was  
my turn.I was excited until we read a  
sign above the door.The stairs twisted 
and turned.There were three stages the 
first was the bell ringers chamber the 
second was the ropes going to the      
bells the third was the bells.Then we  
got to the top I kept on waving.When I 
got down every one said I was like the 
Queen Mother.From the top of Hanslope  
church I could see Wolverton the       
school and I could see the butcher's   
shop.It was hard to get down 108 steps 
that were very steep I had to hold     
onto a rope on the wall.On one step    
there was a hole and there was a loose 
step.                                  </content>
