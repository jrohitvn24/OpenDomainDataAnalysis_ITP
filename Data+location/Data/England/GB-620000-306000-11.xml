 George Nobbs has lived in Norwich all 
 his life.He likes most things about   
 Norwich,especially the streets,trees, 
 houses and roundabouts. He says       
 Norwich has changed a lot in his life 
 time.In the early 1960s many buildings
 were destroyed, and streets completely
 cleared. Since ten years ago theres   
 not been much change except for the   
 good. More trees have been planted    
 around office blocks.Theres nothing   
 really he'd like changed now.The first
 book he wrote was protesting about the
 destroying of buildings. He does not  
 like the fact that schools and museums
 have all been handed over to the      
 Norfolk County Council. He thinks that
 the shopping facilities are marvellous
 considering the size of Norwich.George
 has published 30-40 books on Norwich  
 and Norfolk.                          </content>
