		<content> Elkstone is a small village           
 (population is about 150), lying just 
 off the Ermin Way, the former Roman   
 road that now links Gloucester and    
 Cirencester. The village has a largely
 farming economy, although some        
 residents commute to nearby towns.    
 Elkstone lies in a valley on the dip  
 slope of the Cotswolds and is         
 therefore typical of settlements in   
 the area which avoid the more exposed 
 tops.                                 
 There are many Cotswold stone houses  
 and cottages in Elkstone, but despite 
 its idyllic appearance the relative   
 isolation and the lack of local       
 amenities create difficulties         
 for those without access to a car.    
 Away from the village there are many  
 large farms and the only retail       
 outlet, the Highwayman Inn on the     
 Ermin Way.                            </content>
