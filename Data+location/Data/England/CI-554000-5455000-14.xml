		<title>14Policing in St.Ouen.</title>
		<content>   There are two categories of police: 
 the{States Police}and the{Honorary    
{Parish police.} This is a system of   
 policing that is unique in the British
 Isles.  The honorary police in        
 the parish are all elected. These     
 include {The Constable,}who is also   
 civil head of the Parish, the         
 Centeniers and other lesser           
 officers.                             
   The officers of the States Police,  
 based in St Helier, have powers       
 similar to their U.K. counterparts    
 in the town parish but, in the        
 country parishes, do not have the     
 power to{charge}anyone. The authority 
 to charge is vested in the Honorary   
 Police.                               
   The States Police patrol the parish 
 as part of their duties using both    
 motor bikes and cars thus covering    
 the parish for the whole 24 hours.    </content>
