 The area is 50-100m above sea-level,  
 mainly grassland and arable, and lies 
 in a Devonian Sandstone area between  
 the Severn Valley and the Malvern     
 Hills.  It contains parts of the      
 villages of Redmarley d'Abitot and    
 Bromesberrow Heath.  The former name  
 is derived from that of the Norman    
 Lords of the Manor who came from      
 Abitot in Normandy.                   
 Formerly a dairy farming area, in     
 recent years there has been a change  
 to arable.  Few people work locally.  
 In 1644 a skirmish took place between 
 Royalists and Parliamentarians.  There
 are two cavalry standards of that time
 in Bromesberrow church.               
 There are several 18-19C mansions     
 Pfera Hall, Drury Lane House, Haffield
 and Bromesberrow Court.  Bury Court   
 has a Norman vaulted cellar.          </content>
