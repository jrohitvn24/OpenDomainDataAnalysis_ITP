		<content>  We conducted a survey in our school. 
 All the fathers worked and 86% of the 
 mothers worked. 40% of parents worked 
 in Gloucester, 7 miles away, 12% in   
 Cheltenham, and 39% work locally. Of  
 the children who knew where their     
 mothers and fathers worked, we found  
 out that 9 work on farms, 4 are       
 teachers, 25 work in shops or other   
 businesses selling things, 12 are     
 engineers, 4 are builders, 7 are      
 nurses, 7 work in hotels or catering, 
 5 do domestic work, 2 are             
 professional men (1 doctor). 4 are    
 secretaries. 1 is a supermum!
