 The Church at Luddesdown, St. Peter   
 and St. Paul, is very old, part was   
 built in l3th Century but much was    
 rebuilt last century. They do not have
 their own vicar, and only one service 
 is held there on a Sunday. The Church 
 is kept locked.                       
 The Church of Dode.                   
 About a mile away is the small Church 
 of Dode, it was a ruin but has been   
 restored this century and alienated to
 the Church of Rome, a service is held 
 once a year in the Church now known as
 "Our Lady of the Meadows". It was     
 deserted at the time of the plague and
 is now privately owned.
