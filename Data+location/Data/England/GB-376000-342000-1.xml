		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The village of Madeley was originally 
an Anglo-Saxon settlement called Madan-
lieg and was mentioned in the first    
Domesday Book. It enjoys a good posit- 
ion with access to the market towns of 
Newcastle-under-Lyme, Crewe and Nant-  
wich. One feature of Madeley is the    
pond which supports a variety of wild  
life. The village has many old build-  
ings of character, the most impressive 
being the 16th century Old Hall.       
  Much of the area still belongs to the
Crewe Family estate.                   
  There have been many changes and dev-
elopments in the last forty years,incl-
uding two council estates, a teacher   
training college and three private     
estates, all of which have encouraged  
more people into the village. Madeley  
remains a quiet rural village, despite 
being flanked by the main Crewe-London 
railway line and the M6 Motorway.      </content>
