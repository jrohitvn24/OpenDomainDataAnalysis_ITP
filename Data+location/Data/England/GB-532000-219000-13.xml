		<title>13A HOLIDAY FROM DANE END AREA</title>
		<content>{MY HOLIDAY BY SALLY:}On {SATURDAY I}  
 didn't go anywhere but on Sunday I    
 went to see Grandma who lives in      
 Southgate, London. We had a lovely    
 lunch of roast beef, yorkshire pudding
 and we finished with a trifle. In the 
 afternoon we went for a walk in the   
 park and came home at 9pm. MONDAY: I  
 did not go out. TUESDAY: I went to    
 Ferique's house. She has a pony       
 called Shilling. He is a bay and we   
 did jumps on him. WEDNESDAY: We went  
 swimming with some friends and I did  
 some dives. THURSDAY: In the afternoon
 I went riding and rode a pony called  
 Surprise. FRIDAY: I stayed at home.   
 SATURDAY: I went to Ware Carnival and 
 saw Tessa Sanderson. Nicki Slater and 
 Karen Barber. On Saturday night I went
 to Ware Fair with my family. I won    
 three balloons and Tim, my brother,   
 won a goldfish and it is still alive! </content>
