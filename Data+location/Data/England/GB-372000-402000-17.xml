		<content> HOW CLOUGH FARM                       
 The only farm in this area now, is on 
 Old Clough Lane. The farmer has lived 
 there for 68 years and once had 60    
 head of cattle. Much of his land has  
 now been bought to build houses on and
 he has few animals. The farm is mainly
 a dairy farm. Every day the farmer    
 does a milk round, delivering milk to 
 about 1000 houses.  He doesn't use a  
 milk float, but instead has two horses
 which pull two 4_wheel milk carts. He 
 says this is easier and cheaper for   
 him as his customers are close        
 together. He sometimes keeps pigs and 
 has 1000 hens which produce eggs. He  
 sells these to his milk customers and 
 callers to the farm. He doesn't grow  
 crops but he has a tractor and        
 haymaking machine. He keeps most of   
 the hay for his two horses and sells  
 any left over.                        </content>
