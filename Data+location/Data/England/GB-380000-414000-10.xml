		<content>   There are 3 reservoirs in the       
 Deeply Vale area. The largest is      
 Ashworth Reservoir. The other main    
 reservoir is Deeply Hill and its sub  
 resrvoir.                             
   Near to Deeply Hill reservoir is an 
 old ruined mill. Ashworth Reservoir is
 situated near to the Cheesden Lumb    
 Mill. When looking at it today from   
 the western overflow side the two     
 buildings can be seen. In dry weather 
 it is possible to walk on the large   
 overflow steps. These are about 10    
 feet high. At the bottom of the       
 overflow is a stagnant pool. This is a
 death trap for local sheep. If they   
 fall in they cannot climb up the steep
 banks.
