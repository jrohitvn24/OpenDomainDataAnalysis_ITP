		<title>01GAZETTEER OF HUDDERSFIELD</title>
		<content> Huddersfield lies at the foot of the  
{Pennines.}The main industries are     
{textiles, engineering &amp; chemicals     
 although in recent years many         
 factories have closed down especially 
 in the field of{textiles.}A once      
 prosperous town attracted many        
{immigrants}from the{West Indies}and   
 the{Indian sub-continent.}Today the   
 people of Huddersfield exist in a     
 peaceful{multi-ethnic}community.With  
 a population of approximately{124,000 
{people.}The level of unemployment is  
 not as high as in other towns and     
 cities in the country, but the        
 industrial depression is beginning to 
 catch up as shown by the number of    
 recent{shop &amp; factory closures.}The   
 cultural life is centred around the   
 Town Hall and the largest educational 
 establishment is the Polytechnic.
