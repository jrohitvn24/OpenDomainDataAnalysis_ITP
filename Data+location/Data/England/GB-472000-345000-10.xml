		<title>10Clubs in Flintham.</title>
		<content> The{WI}has been in existence since    
 1929. In November 1985 it's name was  
 officially changed to{Flintham and    
{Syerston WI}to recognise the growing  
 ties between the 2 villages. Having   
 gone through a stagnant patch the WI  
 has modernised it's outlook and so    
 attracted more younger members.       
{The Scout Group}now 10 years old meets
 weekly in the Old Reading Room and has
 recently started a Beavers group. The 
 Scouts organise an annual Bonfire     
 Party for the village.                
 There are{football and cricket}teams- 
 most members live in Newark but have  
 had links with Flintham in the past.  
 There is no{Youth Club}at the moment, 
 the teenagers meet nightly in the bus 
 shelter!                              
 A{Mother and Toddlers' Group}meets    
 weekly but may soon have to close due 
 to lack of demand!                    </content>
