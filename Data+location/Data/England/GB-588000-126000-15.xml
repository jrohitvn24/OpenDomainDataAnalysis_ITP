		<title>15Pedal Bikes</title>
		<content>  We ride our{pedal bikes}up and down  
 the scramble track, doing free-style  
 over the jumps and dips.  A jump is   
 usually made from 2 tyres and a plank 
 of wood.                              
  Each stunt that you can do has its   
 own special name.  A{Wheelie}is       
 pulling up your front wheel and riding
 on the back wheel. A{Bunny Hop}is when
 both wheels of the bike leave the     
 ground and an{American Bunny Hop}is   
 when the front wheel leaves the ground
 before the back wheel.  To do an{Endo 
 you pull on your front brake so that  
 your back wheel leaves the ground but 
 your front wheel must not; you have to
 be very careful when trying this stunt
 or you will go over your handle bars  
 and hurt yourself.                    
  There are special stunt bikes called 
{BMXs}but you can do the stunts with an
 ordinary bike.                        </content>
