		<content> One of the best shopping areas lies on
 Harehills Lane, small shops line both 
 sides of this road.  There are a good 
 range of shops and most of the items  
 needed by local residents can be      
 purchased there.  B &amp; Q Supercentre is
 busy all week.  This store sells a    
 huge range of goods for improving or  
 maintaining one's home.  It is one of 
 the largest shops in the area.  In the
 southern part of Seacroft estate there
 are not many shops.  In one group of  
 four shops two had windows boarded to 
 prevent damage by vandals. One was    
 completely closed and the other was   
 continuing to trade behind its wooden 
 defences. Another group of shops had  
 steel wire mesh protection for their  
 windows. Shopkeepers must find it     
 difficult and dis-heartening to run a 
 shop here.
