After I woke up,I lay in bed for a     
while then I got dressed.After I got   
washed I went downstairs to have my    
breakfast.Then I brushed my teeth      
and put on my shoes and coat to go to  
work with my mam.We walked to the bus  
and took a ride on the Metro we got    
off. I helped my mam do her job,that is
clean my uncle's pub.Then we did the   
Metro and bus journey home again.As    
soon as we got home I took my dog for a
walk and then played with him.I played 
my records in the house because it was 
raining.When it stopped I went out and 
played on the slide.After 6pm. I       
watched T.V. then played some more     
records and went to bed.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
