		<content>   This D-block in mid-Cornwall is     
 entirely{rural}in character. It       
 includes the stretch of the River Fal 
 between Grampound and Tregony, which  
 was once navigable. The only amenities
 in the area are found in the northern 
 third of Tregony included in this     
 block. Similarly north Tregony is the 
 only is the only centre of population.
 The block contains about 350 people.  
 The main activity is{farming,}mostly  
 dairying; there are about 27 farms in 
 the block.                            
{  Topography:}Devonian sandstones and 
 slates give rise to undulating relief 
 up to 103m most of which drains to the
 Fal at about 12m. Patches of woodland 
 are found on valley sides and typical 
 Cornish hedges line the roads. Field  
 boundary hedges are important animal  
 and plant habitats. Churches appear   
 unrelated to present population cover.</content>
