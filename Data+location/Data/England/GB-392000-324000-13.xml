		<title>13The "Corner Shop".</title>
		<content>                                       
    In our built up area there are many
"corner shops" still in existence.     
They not only sell food, but many      
other items; from birthday cards to    
shoe laces.Also, some now have a video 
hire   section to supplement their     
income.                                
    Many corner shops now struggle to  
survive because of people travelling to
supermarkets to buy groceries.         
Therefore they  have to stay open late 
at night and on Sunday mornings to     
boost their income.                    
    If a new proposed law is passed,   
allowing Sunday trading for large      
stores,the" corner shop"may well       
disappear.Competition would be too     
fierce.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
