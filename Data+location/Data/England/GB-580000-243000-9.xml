		<title>09A school day</title>
		<content>   Most of us arrive by taxi - only    
 five live in Foxearth. At 9.0 we have 
 Assembly; I like the hymns in the BBC 
 book best. We do the 'hard' work most 
 of the morning starting with Diary; I 
 like to do a picture with mine. We go 
 on to Maths and English. Most days    
 there is a TV programme - more work   
 and it's hard to keep up to date. If  
 all goes well we can have a short go  
 on the computer between subjects. Mrs 
 Flinn sells biscuits and nuts at break
 and she looks after us at dinnertime. 
 In the summer we all have a swim at   
 1pm.  In the afternoons we do art, or 
 needlework or pottery with Mrs Finch  
 and Mrs Flinn helps. If it's fine Mr  
 Finch takes netball and rounders. I   
 thought the ball was hard at first but
 it's really good. We haven't enough   
 for a school team. We go home at 3.30.
   I usually enjoy it very much.       </content>
