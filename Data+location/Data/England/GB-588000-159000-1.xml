		<title>01GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content>The area includes the villages of      
Bredgar ,Tunstall, Rodmersham Green and
Highsted.In addition there are numerous
hamlets based mainly on farms.It is a  
rural area, on the southern outskirts  
of the town of Sittingbourne, to which 
the inhabitants of the area must look  
for amenities such as shopping and     
leisure.Farming is based on orchards,  
sheep,and cereal crops.The major       
industrial concern is the Shell Oil    
Research Laboratories.Road travel is   
the only means of transport,mainly     
private cars,as bus services are       
infrequent.The M2 motorway crosses the 
grid but there is no point of access.  
Housing styles vary from a medieval    
manor house to 20th century estates.   
Three village schools provide education
for children to the age of eleven. Few 
people work on the land;most commute to
main Kent towns or London.             </content>
