		<title>14GOLDHANGER - CHURCH STREET</title>
		<content>{Church Street}is called Church        
 Street because there is a Church in   
 the Street.The Church is made of      
 bricks and stones.There is also a     
 School in Church Street but it has    
 closed down. When I walked down Church
 Street I felt quite scared because of 
 the graveyard,although when it is     
 sunny it feels nice and peaceful.There
 is a small garage which is called the 
 Bulldog,which was built in 1932.The   
 garage,as I looked at it,was very     
 small and he could only fit one car in
 to work on at a time.There is a public
 house called the Chequers and further 
 up the road is another pub called     
 the Cricketers.There is a house       
 called{Goldhanger Hall}which is       
 surrounded by trees.There is also an  
 engineering works which specialises in
 agricultural machinery.
