		<content> There are many interesting places in  
 the area such as Lea Hall, Ongars     
 (both of which are mentioned in the   
 original Domesday Book), Colville Hall
 and Corringales.  It is said that     
 Robert the Bruce was  born in a ditch 
 outside Corringales and later in his  
 life came back and stayed the night.  
 Near to Mill Cottage there was a      
 windmill which was pulled down in     
 1906.  All the villagers used to bring
 their grain here as did the people    
 from Sheering, Hallingbury and        
 Hatfield Broad Oak.  In the garden of 
 Mill Cottage is a well which is forty 
 feet deep.  There is an abattoir which
 is one of the biggest in the country. 
 Down Hall is a large hotel situated in
 quiet countryside and caters for      
 conferences and banquets.  Other      
 notable places of interest will be    
 found on other pages.                 </content>
