     ACTIVITIES IN BRADWELL            
    ------------------------           
    Many years ago Bradwell had a      
 bowling green at the side of the Bath 
 Hotel (now called the Thatchers       
 Inn).  Some time later this closed    
 down, and the land was bought for     
 building purposes.  In 1984 Mr.C.Bland
 decided to form a new committee to    
 build a new bowling green.  Bradwell  
 Sports Club bought a field opposite   
 the Thatchers Inn for a football pitch
 and allowed the bowling green         
 committee and other volunteers to     
 build the green.  They started        
 building this in 1984 and finished in 
 1985.  It is hoped that the green will
 feel its first bowl this year.
