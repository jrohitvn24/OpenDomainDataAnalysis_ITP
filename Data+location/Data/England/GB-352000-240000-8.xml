		<title>08BISHOP OF HEREFORD'S SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    The Bishop of Hereford's Bluecoat  
 School or "Bishop's" as it is         
 affectionately known is a Church of   
 England Comprehensive school. It was  
 founded in 1973 when "comprehensive"  
 plans were implemented in the City of 
 Hereford, with the amalgamation of two
 secondary modern schools - Bishop's   
 and The Bluecoat School. The School   
 boasts excellent facilities with many 
 new buildings. Science laboratories,  
 the metalwork, engineering and pottery
 rooms are reckoned to be the best in  
 the County. Pride is also taken in the
 sport's complex and the large library.
    Children of 11-16 are catered for  
 and 'church places' are reserved for  
 children living outside the normal    
 catchment area.                       
    The school enjoys its academic     
 success and its good reputation for   
 Sport, Drama, and Music.              </content>
