		<title>07ENERGY IN BOOTHBY PAGNELL</title>
		<content>   The main energy scource is          
 electricity.However a few houses still
 have gas powered impliments.The street
 lighting were not erected until 1984. 
   In the 1930s a pump_house was       
 built.It had a massive engine which   
 pumped water from the underground     
 stream that runs to Somerby. The      
 pump_house is no longer in use but a  
 well is situated directly beside it.  
 Boothby water is now transported from 
 the Rutland Water's resevoir.
