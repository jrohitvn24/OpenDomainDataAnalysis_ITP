    The peaceful atmosphere of Mashbury
and the surrounding area is much       
appreciated by its residents, although 
young people feel that there is little,
if any, social life. The elderly feel  
that the area is poorly served by shops
and there is inadequate public         
transport.                             
    The parish often gets cut off in   
winter, which is both difficult and    
dangerous for the elderly. The village 
as a whole feels that their is a lack  
of community spirit in the area . Many 
people dislike the gravel pits and     
also feel threatened by the new        
development of Stansted airport. Some  
villages are concerned that the        
farmers are destroying the local       
enviroment by removing hedgerows and   
also destroying ancient buildings.     </content>
