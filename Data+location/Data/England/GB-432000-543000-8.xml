		<content>   {Elemore Hall,}once the home of many
 landowning families such as the       
 Andersons, Halls, Congers and Baker-  
 Baker, dates from 1637. It was burnt  
 down in 1720 and rebuilt. Its origins 
 are obscure, but early records show   
 that the land was given by Bishop     
 Pudsey to Finchale Priory in 1200 A.D.
    Today it is designated as a Durham 
 County Council Special School and     
 houses approximately 40 people.       
    The driveways, ponds and gardens   
 are still in evidence and provide a   
 beautiful setting for walks.          
   {The Manor House. }Once again its   
 origins are obscure, but it is close  
 to the site of the old Priory. For the
 last sixty years it has been the home 
 of the Glen family.                   
   {The Vicarage}was built in Victorian
 times. It became a private residence  
 in 1950.                              </content>
