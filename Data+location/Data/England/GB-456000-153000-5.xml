		<content> WE INTERVIEWED A LADY WHO  HAS LIVED  
 IN WOOTTON ST. LAWRENCE FOR 18 MONTHS 
 AND IS HAPPY THERE. THE HOUSE SHE     
 LIVES IN IS OPPOSITE THE CHURCH AND   
 WAS BUILT BY HER HUSBAND. THE AREA HAS
 A MIXED AGE GROUP OF PEOPLE. THE AREA 
 IS GOOD FOR PEOPLE AGED 15 AND UNDER. 
 SHE SHOPS IN THE TOWN BUT SOMETIMES IN
 THE VILLAGE. THE PEOPLE ARE VERY      
 FRIENDLY. SHE SAID THERE ARE A LOT OF 
 CHILDREN IN WOOTTON ST. LAWRENCE. SHE 
 DOES NOT MIND TRAVEL. SHE TAKES THE   
 CHILDREN TO SCHOOL IN THE CAR. THERE  
 ARE ONLY 2 BUSES A WEEK. SHE LIKES TO 
 GO OUT IN HER CAR. SHE DOES NOT RELY  
 ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT. SHE WOULD NOT    
 LIKE TO CHANGE ANYTHING ALTHOUGH      
 WOOTTON ST. LAWRENCE IS QUITE ISOLATED
 AND THERE IS NOTHING TO KEEP YOU      
 OCCUPIED IN THE EVENING.              
                                       
                                       </content>
