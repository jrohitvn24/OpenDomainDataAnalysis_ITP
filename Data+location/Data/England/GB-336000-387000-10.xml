 The people who do this  job  are known
 as {LOLLIPOP MEN}or {LOLLIPOP LADIES}.
 They regard their  job  as  worthwhile
 but it does have certain drawbacks.   
                                       
 They work in  all weathers, some found
 the uniform  cumbersome, drivers  were
 abusive  and  impatient, and  the  job
 itself was sometimes dangerous.       
                                       
 The two  ladies  we  interviewed  said
 that the children  of {Dovedale School
 were well behaved and sensible when it
 came to crossing the road.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
