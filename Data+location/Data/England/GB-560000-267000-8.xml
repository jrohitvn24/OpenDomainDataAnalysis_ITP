		<title>08Red House Stud, Exning</title>
		<content>   Red House Stud was built between the
 two wars by Lord Glanely. When he died
 it returned to arable land and only   
 restored to a working stud in 1970, by
 the present management. The stud      
 includes 120 acres of grass-land and  
 paddocks, mainly used by the mares,   
 foals, and the cows that are needed   
 to eliminate the red worm in the grass
 that the horses eat. The stallion at  
 stud is called{"Mansing"}and usually  
 covers 52 mares a year. He is 16 years
 old and worth over two million pounds,
 and each visiting mare is charged     
 Â£2,500 to be covered by him. They have
 40 to 50 foals born a year between    
 January and June and these are sold   
 throughout the world. New technology, 
 for example the introduction of       
 Test tube foals is creeping into the  
 racing industry to enable more and    
 healthier foals to be born.           </content>
