		<title>13GREAT BUDWORTH, CHESHIRE.</title>
		<content> Great Budworth is a picturesque       
 village two miles to the north of     
 Northwich. It is situated on a hilltop
 and its fourteenth century church is a
 prominent local landmark. The largest 
 parish in Cheshire used to be centred 
 on the church, comprising 35 townships
 which explains why Budworth has the   
 prefix Great. The church contains a   
 massive medieval oak chest which has  
 four locks. It is tradition for the   
 keys to be held by four separate      
 people, three churchwardens and the   
 vicar. There has been a school in     
 Great Budworth since 1600, when a     
 Grammar School was founded. When it   
 moved to Northwich, the building      
 became the village school and remained
 in use until 1857 when the present    
 school was built. Many village schools
 are under threat of closure, but Great
 Budworth school should survive.       </content>
