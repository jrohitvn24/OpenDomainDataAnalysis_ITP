		<title>19Chew Stoke Church</title>
		<content> The Church at Chew Stoke, with its    
 fine tower, was built in the 15th     
 century by the{St. Loe}family whose   
 coat of arms can be seen on the       
 Rectory wall. After a fire, the       
 Victorians restored the interior and  
 put in one hundred and fifty-six stone
 and wood angels. The Church bells were
 made at the famous{bell foundary}here 
 by the{Bilbie family}who were also    
 clockmakers. Their bells hang in many 
 local churches today. Still surviving 
 in 1985 are two 700 year old yew trees
 in the churchyard and on either side  
 of the gardener's shed are two richly 
 carved Saxon stones. The Methodist    
 Chapel in Chew Stoke is also still    
 flourishing. It was built on land     
 given by a farmer after{Wesley}had    
 preached at his farmhouse nearby.
