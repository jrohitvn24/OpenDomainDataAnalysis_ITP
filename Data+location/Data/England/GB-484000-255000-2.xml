and one post office.There are no       
private schools,but there is a primary 
school in the High Street. There is a  
little stream which runs though the    
middle of the village.There are no     
houses for old aged pensioners to go to
when they are too old to look after    
themselves .They have a doctor but not 
a dentist.A fish and chips van comes   
round during the week There is no      
market,the nearest being in Northampton
8 miles away where the villagers       
have to do their main shopping.They    
have a garage and petrol station,but   
there is no bank or building society.  
There is a village football team  and  
there is a park near the shops.
