		<title>17HORSE RIDING</title>
		<content>    IN OUR CLASS,THREE PEOPLE          
 GO RIDING. I USUALLY GO RIDING WITH A 
 FRIEND. MY PONY IS CALLED "DOUGAL".   
    IF YOU OWN A PONY THIS IS WHAT YOU 
 NEED. FIRSTLY QUITE A BIG{FIELD}AND A 
{STABLE}FOR THE WINTER. YOU SHOULD ALSO
 HAVE A{HALTER,}A{BRIDLE}AND A{SADDLE. 
 THIS IS CALLED YOUR TACK. IN ADDITION 
 YOU WILL NEED SOME {SADDLE SOAP,}SOME 
{SADDLE OIL,}SOME {HOOF OIL}AND BRUSHES
 LIKE A{DANDY BRUSH}FOR THEIR TAILS,A  
{BODY BRUSH}FOR THEIR COAT AND A{COMB  
 FOR THEIR MANES.                      
    IN THE SUMMER KEEPING A PONY COSTS 
 VIRTUALLY NOTHING BECAUSE THE PONY CAN
 EAT GRASS. IN THE WINTER IT COSTS     
 QUITE A LOT BECAUSE HAY IS Â£1.25 A    
 BALE AND THE STRAW COSTS ABOUT THE    
 SAME. IF YOUR PONY NEEDS A VET IT CAN 
 BE VERY EXPENSIVE. CARING FOR YOUR    
 PONY CAN BE QUITE A RESPONSIBILITY    
 BUT IT IS A VERY WORTHWHILE HOBBY.    </content>
