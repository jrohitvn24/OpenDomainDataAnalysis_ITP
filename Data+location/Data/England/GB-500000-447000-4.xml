		<title>04Beswick Hall</title>
		<content> "Beswick" appears to come from "Besi" 
 and "wic", meaning "Besi's dairy      
 farm". Two of the major farming       
 families of the area occupy the Hall -
 the Beachell family in the south wing 
 and the Duggleby family in the north. 
 The Hall was built around 1590, and is
 mainly of red brick with black brick  
 diapering. There are three storeys    
 plus attics. The roof is tiled with   
 stone dressing at the gable ends. Some
 of the former bar and transome        
 windows are now blocked, possibly as a
 result of adaptations and alterations 
 carried out in the 18th Century.      
 The southern wing is approached by a  
 central front gravelled drive, leading
 to a front-facing (east) door. A      
 second drive leads to the northern    
 wing and its separate, north-facing   
 doorway. The Hall stands in its own   
 walled grounds and gardens.           </content>
