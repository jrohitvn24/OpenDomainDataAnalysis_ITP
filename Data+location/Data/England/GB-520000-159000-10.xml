		<title>10EPSOM COLLEGE</title>
		<content>{Epsom College,}an independent boarding
 school, was opened in 1855 by John    
 Propert as the{Royal Medical          
{Benevolent College}in order to provide
 accomodation for pensioners with      
 medical connections and for orphans of
 medical families.{The opening was     
{attended by Prince Albert}and the     
 college has been patronised by the    
 Monarch ever since.{The Queen and     
{H.R.H the Duke of Edinburgh attended  
{the school's  centenary in 1955.      
 Originally the school housed 100      
 pensioners and 100 boys. Now it       
 accomodates 630 pupils (including 350 
 boarders) of whom some 50-60 are girls
 in the 6th form (first admitted 1976).
 The school has a strong science bias, 
 illustrated by its unique biological  
 museum, but is also strong in other   
 areas. With an 80 acre  site the      
 school is very strong in major sports.</content>
