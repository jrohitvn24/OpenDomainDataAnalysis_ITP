		<content>  Deighton has contracted over the last
 50 years, and lost its school,village 
 inn and parish council.Mrs.Kirby snr. 
 was a pupil at the school,which closed
 in 1930.The teacher lived in          
 the village.There is a stained glass  
 window in the church commemorating the
 teacher's 45  years at the school.The 
 house at the Southern end of the      
 terraced row was formerly the Three   
 Horseshoes Inn, but this closed in the
 early 1950's.Behind the row of        
 terraced houses is a grassed area     
 surrounded by a moat about 10 feet    
 deep.It is thought to have been the   
 site of an ancient manor dating back  
 to King Stephen and also used as a    
 stockade to protect  cattle from      
 marauding Scots.The old brick making  
 site on the Appleton road known  as   
 the Tileshed was latterly used for    
 animals until it collapsed in 1984.  .</content>
