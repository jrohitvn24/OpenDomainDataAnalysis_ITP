		<title>09DOMESTIC BUILDINGS, S CREAKE</title>
		<content> Most of the dwellings in S Creake are 
 of cottage type, built of brick, flint
 or both, with pantile roofs. This is  
 because there is not suitable building
 stone in N Norfolk.                   
 Many windows are of the casement      
 variety.  A few older houses and barns
 have clunch or chalk built into some  
 walls.  Few of the cottages are more  
 than 200 years old.  The exceptions   
 being two of the remaining Manor      
 houses; one now a farm, the other     
 divided into two residences, and three
 other farmhouses.  About a third of   
 the village houses are Council built, 
 and fairly modern, built since 1935;  
 the majority being post-war. These are
 all brick, with pantiled roofs.  A few
 bungalows for elderly are included.   
 Many of the older cottages are build  
 around 'yards', with little or no     
 garden.                               </content>
