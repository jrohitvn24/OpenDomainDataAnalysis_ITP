		<title>04A Visit to the Brickworks.</title>
		<content>  15 pupils from Whipton Middle School 
 visited Westbrick.20 million bricks   
 are made each year.3 million of these 
 are handmade.The clay is quarried next
 door to the brickworks.It is then     
 crushed into small lumps,ground into  
 dust,mixed with water and sent to     
 different parts of the factory to be  
 moulded. The bricks are then stacked  
 on 'kiln cars'. These run on rails and
 are pushed through the great long     
 kiln.This takes one and a half        
 days.It is gas-fired and the bricks   
 reach a temperature of 1090           
 degrees.When they come out they are   
 still at 120 degrees.Business is very 
 good at present in these days of      
 unemployment.They told us they could  
 not make the bricks fast enough.
