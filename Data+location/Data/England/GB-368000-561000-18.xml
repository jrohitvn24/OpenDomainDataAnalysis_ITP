		<content>    My dad is the Pastor at the        
{Bethshan Church. }We go to church     
 twice on a Sunday: morning and night  
 We go on a Tuesday night as well. We  
 sing songs at church and my Dad stands
 up and talks to the people. About     
 twelve people go to listen.           
   There is a{United Reformed Church}on
 Westgate. It has fifty members and has
 a service at 9.30 on a Sunday morning.
 It shares a minister with the United  
 Reformed Church at Brampton.          
  The{Assembly Mission}up the West End 
 is called the "Tin Mission" because it
 is built of corrugated iron.  A lorry 
 ran into the side of it this year and 
 badly damaged it.                     
    There is a little{Methodist Church 
 in Park Village. It has a service on a
 Sunday evening and a Sunday School for
 the children in the village and near  
 by farms.                             </content>
