		<title>10CHELMARSH RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> The reservoir was built in 1965.It is 
 used for storing water pumped out of  
 the River Severn. It then goes across 
 the river via huge pipes to the water 
 filtration works where it is purified 
 before entering the domestic water    
 supply.                               
     Before it was built there was just
 a marshy area in a shallow valley.Huge
 diggers deepened the valley and now it
 looks very attractive.There is a      
 sailing club from which members can   
 sail their little boats called        
 dinghies.                             
     There is a small colony of herons 
 which nest in the wood alongside the  
 reservoir and other visitors include  
 Canada geese,mallard, tufted          
 duck,great crested grebe and          
 cormorants.Fish include               
 trout,eel,barbel and chub.
