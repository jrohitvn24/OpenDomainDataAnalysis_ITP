		<title>16CONCERNS ABOUT LEVEN</title>
		<content> We interviewed 9 mums. I asked if they
 liked living in Leven 7 people liked  
 it but two people were just visiting  
 the village. I asked have you always  
 lived in the village. One person said 
 yes, 5 people said no, so I asked     
 where they had come from, most had    
 from Hull or its suburbs;two had come 
 from S.Yorkshire. I asked if they     
 thought the village people were       
 friendly, they answered that they     
 were.                                 
 I wanted to find out if they thought  
 the village was noisy or quiet. Tidy  
 or untidy. The survey found that most 
 thought the village was quiet and     
 tidy.The children in my class think   
 that it is untidy especially near the 
 bus stop and shops,as there are sweet 
 &amp; fish &amp; chip papers &amp; empty packets. 
 blowing around.The children felt that 
 there should be more rubbish bins.    </content>
