		<title>18WHERE FATHERS WORKED</title>
		<content>    We found out that 81 dads worked in
 London, 61 worked locally, and 25     
 worked elsewhere. The furthest away   
 that anyone's dad in Hayes Primary    
 worked was Brighton.                  
    As many fathers do not work        
 locally ,as the figures show,the      
 village of Hayes is a classic example 
 of a dormitory village.               
     The local town of Bromley has many
 empty office blocks.If these were used
 by new businesses,or something of that
 sort, fewerwould have to travel long  
 distances to work.
