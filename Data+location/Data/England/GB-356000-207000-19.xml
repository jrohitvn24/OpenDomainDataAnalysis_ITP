		<title>19Life in Sling</title>
		<content> LIFE IN SLING IS MORE OR LESS THE     
 SAME AS ANY OTHER VILLAGE.THERE ARE   
 THE SAME LOCAL SHOPS SUCH AS FOOD     
 SHOPS/POST OFFICES E.T.C LIFE AROUND  
 THERE IS NEARLY THE SAME. CHILDREN    
 FIGHTING AND LADY AND MAN GOING ABOUT 
 THERE JOBS.MOST OF THE CHILDREN PLAY  
 DOWN THE WOODS AND BUILD CAMPS.AT     
 CHRISTMAS OR ANY OUTHER SPECIL DAY    
 THE LOCAL PUB HAVE PARTIES. DURING    
 THE DAY WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE AT      
 SCHOOL THE ADULTS MAKE THE CHILDRENS  
 BEDS AND START PREPARING THE TEA.LIFE 
 IN SLING IS MUCH DIFFRENT TO LIFE IN  
 THE CITY.YOU  WOULD THINK THAT LIFE IN
 SLING IS A BUSY PLACE BUT IT ISNOT AS 
 BUSY AS THE CITY. SLING IS A LOT MORE 
 ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE YOU CAN LISTEN TO  
 THE BAND AT SCARR,etc...
