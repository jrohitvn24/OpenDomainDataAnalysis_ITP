		<title>16GARDENING IN THEDDINGWORTH</title>
		<content> There is a considerable interest in   
 gardening. Members of more than half  
 the households said they gardened for 
 pleasure, with only 6 saying they did 
 not enjoy it. Specialities include    
 growing Alpines, asparagus,           
 chrysanthemums, dahlias, plants in    
 tubs and pots, shrubs. 27% of all     
 households supply their vegetable     
 needs for the whole year whilst a     
 further 25% supply their households   
 for part of the year. More than 40% of
 households grow more than 4 varieties 
 of herb.
