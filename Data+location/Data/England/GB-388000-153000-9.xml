 to have surrounded a medieval manor   
 house. The site which has not been ex-
 cavated to date, is scheduled by the

      Grange Farm belongs to the Gadd  
 family. It is 200 acres in size. and  
 has a dairy herd of 150 friesian cows.
 Mr. Gadd also owns a racing stud of 5 
 horses and ponies. He also has 5 more 
 in training. He keeps 1 black stallion
 for breeding.                         
                                       
      When I visited Grange Farm I     
 liked the stallion best because he    
 seemed gentle in the stable, but I    
 doubt that he would be very nice out-

 body if they didn't know how to handle
 him the right way.  Neil Duff aged 9.
