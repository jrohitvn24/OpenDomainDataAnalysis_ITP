 banning traffic and paving the road is
 the most significant recent           
 development. The old road was paved in
 the first half of 1984 by the council 
 workmen, and the area has been        
 decorated with flower tubs, trees and 
 wooden seats leaving room for early   
 morning delivery vehicles. There are a
 wide variety of shops, supermarkets,  
 banks and building societies. The     
 largest shop is{Marks and Spencer     
 which itself has been extended and    
 modernised. The precinct attracts a   
 variety of{buskers}including a        
 saxaphone player, a pianist and a     
 several bands who perform during

{South Bay}is an amusement complex,    
 called{The Olympia,}containing fast   
 food outlets, bumper cars, waltzers, a
 medieval village and a pub.           </content>
