		<title>16OMBERSLEY BYPASS</title>
		<content> The{bypass}is a dual carraige way     
 which runs to the east of Ombersley.  
 The bypass is 1km 800m but only 550m  
 is in our land cover. It is about 10  
 years old. They{built}the bypass to   
 help stop accidents and damaging house
 foundations. They built the bypass to 
 help the bigger vehicles pass through 
 because the village road is too narrow
 to pass through. There are some people
 who still remember what it was like   
 before the bypass was built. The heavy
{traffic}does not come through the     
 village road now the bypass is built, 
 this helps the old people to cross the
 village road. The people who live     
 close to the bypass say the traffic is
 louder than before, but the people who
 live further away said it is still    
 noisy in the morning but it gets      
 quieter later.
