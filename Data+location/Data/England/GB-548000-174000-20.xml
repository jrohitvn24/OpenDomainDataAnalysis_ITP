		<title>20CHURCH GROUPS IN BEXLEYHEATH</title>
		<content> Many of the churches in the area      
 organise recreational groups in which 
 residents can participate.  They do   
 not always appear to be restricted to 
 followers of  particular belief, but  
 the majority of their members do      
 attend that church.                   
                                       
 In the case of St. Paulinus C. of E.  
 church at Crayford, a good example of 
 the type of activity provided is to be
 found.  A typical range of activities 
 follows:-  CUBS &amp; SCOUTS/ BROWNIES &amp;  
 GUIDES catering for boys and girls;   
 DRAMA, MUSIC &amp; SOCIAL GROUPS for all  
 the parishioners; SENIOR CITIZEN'S    
 GROUP for pensioners in the           
 neighbourhood; MOTHER &amp; TODDLER GROUP 
 for pre-school children.  Many of the 
 churches have halls attached and these
 are used for community activities.
