		<title>07Sham Farm,East Sussex.</title>
		<content> Sham Farm gets its name from a wall   
 that was built there to hide imposing 
 farm buildings.When the wall was built
 it was supposed to make the farm look 
 like a very large house when viewed   
 from Eridge Castle.                   
    Sham Farm is an arable farm and    
 crops such as wheat,barley,oats and   
 oil seed rape are grown.In September  
 the farmer sows his seeds and         
 culivates the land with disc harrows. 
 In January,June and December the      
 hedges are cut and the machinery      
 checked and serviced.They have quite a
 lot of machinery at Sham Farm.They    
 have one very large tractor.They also 
 have a machine for spraying fertiliser
 on the fields.They have two ploughs   
 which they don't use now because a    
 plough disturbs the soil too much.In  
 summer they use a large combine       
 harvester to harvest the crops.       </content>
