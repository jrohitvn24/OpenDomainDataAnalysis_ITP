		<content> There are many shops in Keyham. There 
 are food shops, an off licence, post  
 office, second-hand shops, woolshops, 
 newsagents, fish and chip shops and   
 many more. Nearly all the streets have
 at least one shop. I live in Saltash  
 Road, which is a busy main road       
 through Keyham. It has 12 shops       
 including a chemists and an insurance 
 brokers. Most of the shopkeepers are  
 very kind but the shops do vary a lot.
 Every week I buy a Dandy comic from   
 Fleet News in Fleet Street. One of the
 other newsagents sells food as well,  
 but we don't go there because there   
 are lots of flies. Most of the local  
 shop prices are quite reasonable but  
 sometimes we go to a big supermarket  
 further away if we are doing a lot of 
 shopping, because we can save quite a 
 bit of money.There are quite a few    
 hairdressers and takeaway food shops. </content>
