		<content> Buxted School Organisation.           
 Buxted school is now a four class     
 school wwith a teaching compliment of 
 4.6 teachers including the head. The  
 head teaches 5 tenths of the week. The
 classes are arranged  according to age
 and not according to ability. The     
 teaching is such that we try to cater 
 for the needs of the child at any     
 particular time.  There is some group 
 work, a little class teaching to the  
 older children, but children tend to  
 work individually.Mornings are devoted
 to the more formal work and the basic 
 work in English and Maths.Afternoons  
 are spent on project work and art     
 work.Children use the school outdoor  
 pool during the Summer and Autumn     
 terms.We paly football, netball,      
 hockey, athletics, squash. The        
 children learn the recorder.
