		<title>11TYRREL'S WOOD HARDWICK AREA</title>
		<content> Tyrrel's Wood,covering an area of     
 about 70 acres is 1 of the 20 most    
 important woods in Norfolk on account 
 of the great variety of trees mainly  
 deciduous with a few conifers,about 20
 different species were counted        
 including Silver Birch,Oak,Hornbeam,  
 Holly,unusually large Rowans &amp; a large
 Black Poplar.Many are old,some dead &amp; 
 fallen,dead Elms are being cleared to 
 let in light &amp; encourage plants &amp;     
 wildlife,but everywhere there is      
 natural regeneration by seedlings.Dry 
 &amp; overgrown in places,wet in others,  
 there are shrubs,ferns,many kinds of  
 woodland &amp; wetland plants &amp; some      
 fungi.There is evidence of grey       
 squirrels,rabbits &amp; moles;few birds   
 seen but GoldCrests &amp; other species   
 heard.In a dead tree several holes    
 made by Woodpeckers are evident.There 
 is agricultural land around the wood  </content>
