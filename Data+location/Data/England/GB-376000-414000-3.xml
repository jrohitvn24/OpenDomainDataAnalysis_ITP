		<title>03BRICK HOUSES- SUMMERSEAT</title>
		<content> Originally there were ten rows of     
 terraced houses, built in brick for   
 the people who worked at{Joshua       
{Hoyle's Mill.}They were about twenty  
 metres apart and so were very dark    
 inside. They were{'back to back'}     
 houses, so each house had one room    
 upstairs and one downstairs with an   
 attic room.                           
   Many of the houses have fallen into 
 disrepair, and so it was decided to   
{renovate}them. In 1985 three of the   
 rows were knocked down to provide     
 extra light and gardens for those     
 remaining. The people living in the   
 houses had the option to buy them and 
 then they are having grants to        
 renovate them. The whole scheme is    
 expected to take three to four years.
