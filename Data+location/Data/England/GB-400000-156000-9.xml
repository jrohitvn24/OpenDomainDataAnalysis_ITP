		<title>09THE BUTCHERS BARN</title>
		<content> IN THE VILLAGE OF URCHFONT THERE IS A 
 RECONSTRUCTED WOODEN, THATCHED ROOFED 
 BARN WHICH HAS CAREFULLY BEEN REBUILT 
 BY IT'S OWNER MR FORD THE BUTCHER, WHO
 FOUND THE ORIGINAL 14TH CENTURY BARN  
 ON FIRE ON AUGUST 25TH 1983. THE CAUSE
 OF THE FIRE HAS REMAINED A MYSTERY. MR
 FORD AND 3 FELLOW CRAFTSMEN, STUDIED  
 THE STRUCTURE AND TYPES OF WOODS USED 
 IN THE ORIGINAL BUILDING AND AS NEAR  
 AS POSSIBLE HAVE REBUILT TO THE       
 ORIGINAL DESIGN. THIS TOOK 9 MONTHS OF
 HARD WORKAND SEARCHING FOR CORRECT    
 TIMBERS. THE BARN,ONCE USED TO SHELTER
 FARM ANIMALS IS NOW A VILLAGE AMENITY 
 AND THOUGH NOT IN COMPETITION WITH THE
 VILLAGE HALL HAS A SIMILAR USEFUL     
 FUNCTION FOR FUND RAISING EVENTS AND  
 SPECIAL OCCASIONS.
