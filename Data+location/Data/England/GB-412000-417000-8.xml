		<content> In the morning we eat noodles in milk 
 while the men go to the mosque and    
 pray.  Each person in the family gives
 80p for the people in Pakistan.  Then 
 we put on our clothes and wait for the
 men to come home.  We have a dinner of
 Rice and Curry.  Then the ladies cook 
 the evening meal of rice, chapatti,   
 Pila rice with lamb stock, peas coftai
 and meat balls in a curry sauce.      
 Coloured rice, you make white rice    
 and make a syrup out of sugar and     
 butter when you put it in the oven you
 add a drop of red, yellow and green   
 food colouring.                       
 In the afternoon I eat ludoo brafy    
 and jallabia as an afternoon sweet and
 then we go to grandma's and grandad's,
 we say Eid Mubark to them.  If anybody
 we don't know comes to the door we    
 give them some of everything cooked in
 the house.  We eat the evening meal.  </content>
