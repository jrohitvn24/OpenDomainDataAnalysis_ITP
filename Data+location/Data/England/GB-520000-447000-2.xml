		<title>02COASTAL LANDSCAPE OF HORNSEA</title>
		<content> Hornsea is 17 miles north of Hull and 
 is an east coast{resort.}The original 
 cliffs were several miles inland but  
 the{glacier}brought clay and smothered
 the cliffs in{clay.}We wouldn't be    
 here now if it hadn't been for the    
 glacier and we wouldn't have a town   
 called Hornsea. Hornsea is on the     
{Holderness Plain.  }                  
 In Hornsea we have{soft cliffs}so the 
 sea is eating or wearing away our     
 cliffs, so we have to deal with       
{erosion.}Since Roman times, three     
 villages and one fresh-water mere have
 been washed away by the sea.          
 The waves approach the coast          
 diagonally, and push or carry stones  
 and other materials{southwards}along  
 the beach. This is called{longshore   
{drift}and many{groynes}have been built
 to protect our beach.
