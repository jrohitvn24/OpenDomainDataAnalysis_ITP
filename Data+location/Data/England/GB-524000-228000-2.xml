		<title>02HOLY TRINITY CHURCH, WESTON</title>
		<content>{Holy Trinity Church}is on the         
 outskirts of Weston but it is in the  
 centre of the Parish. You can only get
 to the Chuch in a car up a narrow lane
 leading up from Weston_Walkern road.  
 The Church is surrounded by a pleasant
 Churchyard. In{1086}there were{two    
{Parish priests}but there was no sign  
 of a church.{We now have one vicar}but
 he works half time for Weston and half
 time for Baldock Parish. The{North    
{Transept}is the oldest part of the    
 Church and it was built in the{Norman 
 times. The centre arches are also     
 Norman. The six bells are in the      
 Church tower are three hundred years  
 old. The actual date can be checked by
 the inscriptions on the bells. In the 
 churchyard is the grave of{Jack O'Legs
 The grave stones are set fourteen feet
 apart, stepped out by a former church
