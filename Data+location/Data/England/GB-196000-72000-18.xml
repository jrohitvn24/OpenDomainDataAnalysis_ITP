		<title>18WADEBRIDGE-A TOURIST CENTRE</title>
		<content>{Wadebridge}is the{market town} for an 
 area which depends on{tourism}to keep 
 its economy going. Many of the traders
 in the town would find it difficult to
 remain in business without the income 
 from summer visitors. In this area    
 there are 3 large{caravan sites}at{   
{Dinham, Bodieve and The Royal Cornwall
{Show Ground}.At{Edmonton}a group of   
 old cottages has been modernised and  
 let as self catering accomodation     
 Many households in the area advertise{
{"Bed and Breakfast"}and welcome       
 visitors who are touring .            
 On wet days in the summer the town    
 of{Wadebridge}is packed with holiday  
 makers who have come in from the      
 coastal areas looking for something to
 do, and the town needs to provide more
 indoor facilities. The influx of large
 numbers of cars leads to traffic chaos
 in the town.                          </content>
