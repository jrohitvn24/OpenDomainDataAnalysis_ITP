		<title>04THE JUBILEE CENTRE,BOLTON</title>
		<content> The Jubilee Centre is a day centre for
 people who are physically handicapped.
 The people are collected at their     
 homes and returned in the evening.    
   Those who go do many activities in  
 the craft or games rooms.When I went  
 with the school recorder group people 
 were having an indoor bowling         
 match.Others were doing pottery and   
 drawing.One man was doing the         
 washing,some played snooker and       
 table tennis.They also have a small   
 swimming pool,hairdressers and even a 
 little garden.                        
   The people who go do not have to    
 take part in the activities,if they   
 want to they can sit in the room      
 watching television or just have a    
 chat with each oter.                  
   Everyone seems nice and happy with  
 helpful staff.
