		<content>   The area is largely residential     
 council housing, with a variety of    
 industry along Halifax Road &amp; some    
 important recreational sites in       
 Hillsborough. There are several parks 
 &amp; open semi-agricultural land to the  
 north. The accounts which follow seek 
 to reflect this variety and focus     
 particularly on a childs view of the  
 life of a community:-                 
   We are very proud to live in        
 Sheffield because of the steel works  
 &amp; the football teams, but there aren't
 any jobs going because the computers  
 are taking them. Then the only cash   
 you get is the dole. There is nowhere 
 to play as the old people tell us off 
 if we play in the street &amp; we have    
 lots of lorries going up the main     
 road. We sometimes hang around the    
 community centre, but everything else 
 is too expensive.                     </content>
