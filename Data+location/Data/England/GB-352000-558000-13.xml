		<content> Housing development has taken place on
 the South side of Brampton. There are 
 houses in the hamlets of Farlam and   
 Milton and scattered farms and other  
 dwellings.                            
 During the 19th century, detached,    
 semi-detached and terraced houses were
 built of sand-stone, quarried in the  
 Gelt Woods. The farm houses also date 
 from this time and are of sand-stone. 
 Tree road shows continuous housing    
 development, with brick used in place 
 of sandstone since the turn of the    
 century. The houses and bugalows are  
 typical of their own decades;         
 substantially built pre-first world   
 war houses, between-dwellings and more
 recent construction. Gelt Road and    
 Capon Tree Road, though not yet       
 completely in-filled show the same    
 pattern. The western stretch of Capon 
 Tree road has large, recent houses.   </content>
