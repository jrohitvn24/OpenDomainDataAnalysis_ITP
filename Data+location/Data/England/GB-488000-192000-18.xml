		<title>18A Day In The Life Of Melissa</title>
		<content> A typical day for me starts at 7 am.  
 when my dad comes and wakes me. I go  
 downstairs, have a wash, get dressed, 
 eat my breakfast, get my school things
 ready and leave for school at half    
 past eight. I walk up the hill on my  
 own. When I see a friend I like I walk
 with her. At school we do reading     
 first. Outside our classroom are some 
 books. I'm in charge of them with     
 Tricia. At playtime I play 'He' around
 the school bus but I like 'Anchor'    
 too. At dinner time I mostly have     
 sausage and chips. After school my    
 sister comes over to my house with her
 baby boy and she asks me if I want to 
 hold him. I say yes. Most of the time 
 he sleeps. On Mondays at 7 o'clock my 
 dad goes out to play a pool match and 
 tries to win a trophy. He has won some
 already but he is trying to win       
 another. At 9 o'clock I go to bed.    </content>
