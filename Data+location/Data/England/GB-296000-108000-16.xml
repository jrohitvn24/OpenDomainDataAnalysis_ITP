		<title>16LIFE IN THE BUTTERLEIGH AREA</title>
		<content>   In a Questionnaire we asked the     
 people of Butterleigh what they       
 particularly liked about living in    
 the area.This is what we found out:   
   Most said that they enjoy the       
 peace and quiet and the beautiful     
 views and walks in the countryside    
 around.They don't feel isolated-some  
 said that they are in easy reach of   
 the towns for shopping,others said    
 that they were in easy reach of the   
 moors and sea.                        
   They never have any trouble from    
 vandals.Most people think that it is a
 friendly community. The neighbours are
 always willing to help each other     
 especially old people.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
