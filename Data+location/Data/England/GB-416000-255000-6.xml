		<content> There are several{industrial}estates  
 in this area.In one industrial estate,
 we visited two metal works and one    
 brass works.One of the{metal}works    
 made parts for{cars,machine gun stands
 and parts for{armoured cars.}It was   
 too dangerous to enter the factory    
 because of the bits of metal flying   
 about but we had a peep in the door   
 and saw lots of machines.The machines 
 were boring,drilling,thread rolling,  
 turning, milling, broaching and       
 grinding.The factory was called{Peak  
{Engineering,}240 people work there. At
 the industrial estates they make      
 different types of metal and wooden   
 products etc.There is a car repair    
 factory.Down one of the roads the     
 factories are numbered so people can  
 find them.A factory of interest was   
{Si-plan Electronics}who design and    
 manufacture electronics equipment.    </content>
