		<title>04UPHAM CHURCH BELLS</title>
		<content>    Although  there was a church in    
 Upham as early as the thirteenth      
 century, it is not known whether there
 were any bells in it then. Certainly  
 the church had a peal of bells in the 
 sixteenth century and in 1761 these   
 were replaced by six bells cast from  
 copper and tin by Thomas Swaine in a  
 field near Alresford.                 
    In 1978 the wooden supporting      
 frame had rotted, so the bells were   
 removed. A new steel frame was        
 erected by local helpers and two more 
 bells added to make an octave.        
    The first peal of the eight bells  
 was rung in December 1979, being 5088 
 changes of Yorkshire S.Major.         
    The captain of the bell ringers    
 was Walter Stubbington from 1921 until
 1978 and now his son Christopher has  
 succeeded him.
