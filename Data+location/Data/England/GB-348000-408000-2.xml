		<content>         We walked under the bridge,   
 walked down a track, and came to a    
 wooden bridge over the river.         
         As it was time, we walked     
 back. I walked ahead and when I came  
 to the fisherman I turned round and   
 saw a milestone made of cast iron. It 
 said Leeds 99 1/4 miles, Liverpool 28 
 miles, so the Leeds Liverpool Canal is
 127 1/4 miles long. When we got to the
 new bridge, someone noticed that the  
 number was 37. We had a good time, but
 it was very hot.
