		<content> Children are encouraged to help others
 less fortunate than themselves.       
 Charitable organisations exist locally
 and nationally for different causes.  
 Scarborough's oldest charity, The     
 Amicable Society,was founded in 1729  
 to aid the needy children of the town.
 Today it still has 'foundationers'who 
 are assisted with the cost of two     
 outfits of clothes per year. Children 
 have supported several other charities
 during the year by sponsored fund     
 raising activities.Several took part  
 in the annual sponsored swim for St   
 John Ambulance,the first aid/nursing  
 organisation whose volunteers assist  
 whenever crowds gather. During        
 Christian Aid Week money was collected
 for Oxfam to assist children suffering
 from famine in other countries.In July
 they supported Africa Live to assist  
 those suffering in Ethiopia and Sudan </content>
