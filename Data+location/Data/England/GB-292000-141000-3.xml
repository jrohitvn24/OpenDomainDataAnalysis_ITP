		<content> In the morning I wake up at 7a.m.I    
 go downstairs for my breakfast.I have 
 Start which is my favourite cereal.We 
 have it with milk and sugar.I wash and
 put on my grey school uniform.I have  
 to wait a little while until I hear a 
 bang at the door.That is my friends   
 calling me.Our mums chat together.We  
 walk down the lane to the bus stop we 
 have to wait for ages for the bus.It  
 comes from Wheddon Cross and picks up 
 all the children from Wootton Courtney
 Tivington and Luccombe and takes them 
 to Timberscombe School starts at      
 8.55a.m.with Assembly.At 3.10p.m the  
 bus takes me home. Mummy meets me and 
 we go home for tea. We have sausages  
 chips and beans.One night a week I go 
 to Boys' Brigade at the Baptist church
 in Minehead and another to cubs in    
 Alcombe.I like to watch T.V.before    
 going to bed at 8.00p.m.              </content>
