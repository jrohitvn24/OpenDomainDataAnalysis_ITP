		<title>08Attitudes to tourism</title>
		<content>   The Cornish use the word 'emmet' to 
 describe the non-Cornish,or           
 tourists.Every year,these flock to    
 Cornwall in huge numbers to enjoy the 
 rugged coastline,sandy beaches,       
 traditional customs and mild climate. 
 Tourism is a major industry.Many      
 households offer Bed &amp; Breakfast      
 accomodation,whilst a youth camp under
 canvas is set up at Castle Gotha Farm.
 Young people from all European        
 countries visit;especialy the French. 
   The 'emmets' are welcomed because   
 they have money,which generates jobs; 
 and ensure that local communities are 
 able to survive.On the other hand,    
 tourist traffic blocks the narrow     
 Cornish roads,they crowd small beaches
 or perhaps more seriously,they buy    
 local property as holiday homes.Some  
 villages are already becoming ghost   
 towns during thw winter months.       </content>
