		<title>17ALONG THE CANAL AT WOLVERLEY</title>
		<content>{The Staffordshire and Worcestershire  
{Canal}runs  South/North through       
 the S.E. corner of Wolverley.         
   It was built by{James Brindley}and  
 completed in{1772}.                   
   There is one lock with a fall of    
 about 3 metres.This is opposite{The   
{Lock}public house which was a local   
 hostellry for canal people.Today it   
 caters for holiday boats which use    
 the canal.                            
   A bridge under the B4189 takes the  
 canal South to the town of{Stourport  
 following the valley of the{River     
{Stour}.                               
   Holiday makers often moor their     
 boats near The Lock and visit the old 
 village of Wolverley and its          
{sandstone cave houses}.
