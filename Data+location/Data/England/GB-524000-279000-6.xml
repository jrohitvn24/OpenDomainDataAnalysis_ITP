		<content> The villages of Great and Little      
 Raveley and Wistow come under the     
 auspices of Huntingdon Area Health    
 Authority.  The population chooses    
 between two practices, one in a Health
 Centre in Ramsey, the other, a private
 practice, in Warboys.  Both are five  
 miles distant so the home visiting    
 rate for the doctors is fairly high.  
 Patients requiring hospital care go to
 Peterborough or Huntingdon.  Both     
 practices can provide comprehensive   
 facilities which include minor        
 surgery, the visits of school and     
 district nurses, Health Visitors and  
 Social Workers.  Clinics are held for 
 diabetes, chiropody, ante-natal care  
 and dental treatment.  Current        
 problems are bronchitis, arthritis and
 a high degree of asthma in children.  
 Time will tell whether pesticides will
 affect the area's health in future.   </content>
