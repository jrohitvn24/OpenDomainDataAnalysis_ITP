		<content>     The leasehold of the Common is    
 vested in the Malvern Hills           
 Conservators who issue licences for   
 the grazing of animals. Additionally, 
 owners of properties adjoining the    
 Common may enjoy historic{Commoners'  
{Rights. }In 1965 the Commons          
 Registration Act was passed whereby   
 people wishing to retain these rights,
 both for themselves and for future    
 owners of the property, had to apply  
 for registration.                     
     As an example, one commoner has   
 the right to take bracken and to graze
 3O sheep,1O cattle,2 horses,12 geese,4
 pigs and 5O assorted poultry.         
     Any dogs found worrying sheep on  
 the common can be shot on sight.  The 
 police can prosecute owners who allow 
 animals to wander on the highway,     
 though motorists are asked not to kill
 the lambs.                            </content>
