		<title>17WILBERFOSS ENERGY USAGE</title>
		<content>   In Wilberfoss the types of energy   
 used for heating and cooking vary     
 considerably. 100 people were asked   
 which types of energy they used for   
 heating and cooking. For heating 42.3%
 used coal, 17.5% used electricity,    
 6.2% used bottled gas, 10.7% used wood
 burning stoves and 23.1% used oil.    
  The results for cooking were as below
 90.3% used electricity, 3.8% used     
 bottled gas and 5.8% used solid fuel. 
 For both heating and cooking most     
 people used more than one type of     
 energy.                               
   At the moment there is no piped     
 natural gas in the village because it 
 is too expensive to put in.  It would 
 cost Â£250,000 in 1985 to lay the      
 necessary pipes.  The nearest natural 
 gas pipes are some 4 miles away at    
 Dunnington. Most people were satis-   
 fied with the present energy systems. </content>
