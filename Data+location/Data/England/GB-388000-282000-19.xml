		<title>19STOURBRIDGE ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content>{Stourbridge}is a town situated on the 
 western edge of the metropolitan      
 county of the{West Midlands}. It is   
 very close to the rural counties of   
 Staffordshire and Hereford and        
 Worcester. Stourbridge, herefore, lies
 on a{rural/urban fringe .             
    In a Survey of housing type and age
 in Stourbridge, 81% of people who were
 interviewed lived in detached and     
 semi-detached houses and 19% terraced 
 houses or flats. 70% of people who    
 were interviewed lived in dwellings   
 less than 40 years old (post-war) and 
 30% in older dwellings. This data     
 supports the theory that larger and   
 newer dwellings are found on a        
 rural/urban fringe. In a survey of    
 preferences of urban or rural living, 
 87% of people said they preferred to  
 live in a rural environment and 13% in
 an urban environment.                 </content>
