		<content>      In the church there is a small   
 sculpture of John Fairfax's head (a   
 notable family in this area), which   
 was made in 1613.  There are no new   
 grave stones and the church is very   
 much smaller than Wighill Church.     
                                       
      Elizabeth the First's Coronation 
 was arranged by the Vicar of Newton   
 Kyme.  In return she made him Bishop  
 of Carlistle.                         
                                       
      The small school which was given 
 by the Fairfax's in l767 was closed   
 after the second world war and is now 
 a residence.  The vicarage, a large   
 imposing building used to be used as a
 sort of school, where the local       
 gentry's boys were crammed for public 
 schools.
