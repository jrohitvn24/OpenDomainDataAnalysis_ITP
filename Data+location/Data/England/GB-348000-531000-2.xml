		<title>02BLEAK HOUSE PENRITH</title>
		<content> Bleak House Caravan Site is occupied  
 by council tenants and travellers.The 
 council tenants live at Bleak House   
 because there are no available council
 houses(the council tenants use the    
 address "Lakeland View")for a year or 
 more until the council can find them a
 house.The rent per week is low.Only   
 Â£9.50 but the electicity(40p a day)   
 and the gas(Â£12.00 a bottle)is enough 
 to make the amount per week living in 
 a caravan high.The caravans are       
 slightly bigger than ordinary caravans
 used for holidays,but it is still     
 small for a family of five to live    
 in.There are two bedrooms,one with a  
 double bed in it and one with two     
 bunks in.The kitchen and dining room  
 are in the same area with an archway  
 leading to the lounge.There is a      
 toilet and a shower in the caravan but
 they are still very small and cramped.</content>
