		<content> Our pub (c.1686) is, I hope, like the 
 school,{an integral part of the       
{village.}Our aim apart from running a 
 business successfully &amp; giving an out_
 let for my culinary skills, is to     
 involve the local community, not only 
 by giving employment i.e.bar staff,   
 handyman etc.but mainly by organising 
{"Pancake races""Easter bonnet parades"
{"Xmas draws""Trips to Ascot" "Live    
{music",}even a sing_a_long to Fag Ash 
 Lil at the piano.                     
 I do hope people find a welcome here, 
 fine ales &amp; food, but let's not forget
 the ladies, the coffee pot is always  
 on. Nor the children _ our future     
 customers _ there is a garden &amp; pet   
 goat. Apart from this we try &amp; benefit
 the village by shopping locally,there_
 fore money circulates.                
{So village life is lovely _ CHEERS!  }
