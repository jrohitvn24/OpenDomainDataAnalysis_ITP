		<content> Apart from the peaceful open          
 countryside most leisure activities in
 this area are centred on the home and 
 various organisations. One such       
 group-the Yaxham Amenities, organises 
 a number of annual events including a 
 Car Treasure Hunt.It starts at Well   
 Hill and finishes at the Church       
 Hall,with a barbeque and games.Before 
 the start the mileage of each car is  
 recorded.Each competitor has two or   
 three sheets with clues.These clues   
 and directions tell the participants  
 what routes to take. The main task    
 might be to find different wild       
 flowers.                              
 The more flowers you get and answers  
 you get right the more points you     
 win                                   
 The person with the most points wins  
 first prize and the one with the least
 points gets the booby prize.          </content>
