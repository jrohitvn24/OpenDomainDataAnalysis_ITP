		<title>17Children's Pets</title>
		<content>    Pets are animals usually kept by   
 people in their homes e.g.Cats,Dogs,  
 Rabbits,Fish &amp; Birds.A few children   
 have a Tortoise,one girl has a hamster
 and another girl's family has Chickens
    Some children have more than one   
 pet.                                  
    Recently we have read in our local 
 Newspaper,Southern Evening Echo,of    
 some local families keeping Reptiles  
 as pets.This is very difficult because
 an even temperature is needed and has 
 to be maintained.                     
    The following list shows the number
 of children keeping a particular pet:-
    Dogs 7  ;Cats 6  ;Fish 6; Rabbits 4
    Budgies 5  ;Tortoises 1; Ducks 1  ;
    Hamsters 1  ;Chickens 1.           
 We are all expected to look after our 
 own pets.
