		<title>03THE RIVER PINN, HARROW.</title>
		<content>  The{River Pinn}flows on both sides   
 of George V Avenue. The River Pinn is 
 quite shallow and it trickles along.  
  The River Pinns's banks are overgrown
 with nettles and wild flowers. There  
 are{Pink Campions, Dead Nettles, Wild 
{Roses}and{Elderberry.}Along the river,
 trees twist so they form bridges.     
  The river is quite polluted from     
 people throwing rubbish into it.      
  On the left-hand side of George V    
 Avenue, the river is very straight,   
 but on the right-hand side it is very 
 twisty.                               
  The river always flows to the south  
 west from the direction of Hatch End  
 where the source of the river is      
 found.                                
  From the left-hand bank of the River 
 Pinn, you can see the farmhouse of    
{Pinner Park Farm.}
