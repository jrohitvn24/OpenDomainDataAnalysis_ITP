		<content> The white painted Railway station, the
 Nature Reserve, Church, a few         
 shops,some large old houses and a lot 
 more newer smaller ones make up       
 Attenborough village.                 
  The people of Attenborough are mainly
 retired or commuters, who commute each
 day into Beeston or Nottingham.       
  The thirteenth century spire of      
 Attenborough church stands out from   
 the village centre. It was built on a 
 gravel mound higher than the          
 surrounding flood plain and is flanked
 on one side by the Nature Reserve. The
 Powtrell family,William Charlton,     
 Admiral Sir Borlace Warren and Henry  
 Ireton all have conections with it.   
 The most well known {HENRY IRETON     
 ,Cromwells son-in-law was born in the 
 house which stands on the western side
 of the church and lived in a house    
 long since demolished in the village. </content>
