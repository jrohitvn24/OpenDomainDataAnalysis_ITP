 Cattle Cake had just been             
 invented.This was made from Linseed   
 Oiland had to be cracked from slabs.  
 Milking was by hand.  Cattle were fed 
 on chopped straw, pulped mangolds     
 and wet grains from Burton-on-Trent   
 when they were available.             
                                       
 1945                                  
                                       
 Tractors had come in during the war.  
 Theycost between Â£400 and Â£500.  Some 
 were available for Â£100 with spade    
 lugs.  This was a government subsidy  
 because people in the towns were      
 starving, with only 2 hens eggs per   
 week to eat.  Used combine harvesters 
 were imported from Canada at a cost of
 Â£600, but were not really suitasble   
 for the English corn.                 </content>
