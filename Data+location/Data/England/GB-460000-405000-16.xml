		<title>16A typical Doncaster Sunday!</title>
		<content> A typical Sunday in{Edenthorpe}near{  
{Doncaster}is a bit boring because     
 there is hardly anything on the       
 television. In the morning I usually  
 get up at about 10 o'clock to 11      
 o'clock and have my breakfast. I have 
 something like bacon, egg and beans.  
 It lasts me up till about 5 o'clock   
 when I have my dinner. I mostly have  
 something like beef, Yorkshire        
 Pudding, roast potatoes, and cabbage. 
 Sometimes I wash my dad's car if it is
 dirty. Always on a Sunday I have a    
 bath, after which I watch television  
 for a bit. Then I have my supper which
 is usually something on toast like    
 jam, baked beans, or cheese and onion.
 Then I go to bed at about 9 o'clock.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
