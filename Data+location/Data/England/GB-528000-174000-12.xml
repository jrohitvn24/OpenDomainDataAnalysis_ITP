		<title>12Places of Worship near sch.</title>
		<content>In the 1km square in which our school  
was situated we found 14 churches or   
places where people worship. There were
4 church of England churches(one       
especially for the deaf and dumb), 2   
Baptist churches,1 United Reform       
church,1 United Pentecostal faith      
church,1 seventh day Adventist church, 
1 Bible Truth Church of God, 1 Light &amp; 
Life Gospel Fellowship,1 Eighth Church 
of Christ,1 church of the first born, 1
celeslial church of christ.            
All these churches are various kinds of
christian religions. We found no places
where people of other religions can    
worship. There are a lot of Muslims in 
our school but there are no mosques to 
go to in Brixton. They have to travel a
long way to worship Allah. Yet a higher
proportion of Muslims attend mosques   
than Christians attend Church.
