		<title>04Re-opening of Railway ?</title>
		<content> In our weekly local paper this week,  
 July 5th 1985, there is a very        
 interesting item of news.It says,     
 "Government May Help Open Railway."   
 A plan to open a long closed railway  
 line across Dartmoor to Princetown    
 could receive Government support.     
    The scheme-which would mean        
 relaying tracks along the former G.W.R
 branch-should be in the rural         
 development programme for the area,   
 said Mr Rees of COSIRA,the Council for
 Small Industries in Rural Areas.      
    He went on to say,"It would be in  
 keeping with the moorland,very        
 attractive and would not spoil the    
 countryside.The railway would enhance 
 the tourist experience of the area.   
    On Monday,July 8th,our class went  
 for a walk along the old railway track
 to see what it was like.Read our
