Hello, my name is Laura. I am twelve   
years old. On school days I wake up at 
7:30am. On week-ends I wake up about   
9:30am. After I wake up I get washed   
and dressed then have my breakfast. I  
catch the bus to school each week,     
Monday to Friday. I catch the bus at   
about 8:30am. We get to school at      
about 8:45am. I live three miles from  
my school. When school starts at       
9:00am we have tutor time for twenty   
minutes before going to our next       
lesson. Usually on Monday it would be  
Technical Drawing. We have play time   
at 10:30am and then at 12:05pm we have 
lunch. My favorite part of te weekday  
is home time at 4:00pm. School         
finishes at 3:30pm but by th time I    
get home it is 4:00pm. I go to bed at  
about 10:30pm.                         </content>
