		<content> She took us to a watermill.The water  
 mill still works and it is used to    
 make electricity.                     
 It used to be for grinding wheat and  
 barley.The lady said it was nine      
 hundred years old and the gears were  
 made of applewood.                    
 We were amazed when she told us how   
 old the watermill was and then we said
 we had to go.So we said "Thank you "  
 We went to another house and we saw a 
 lady outside we asked our questions   
 and she said she enjoyed answering    
 them and said thank you.Then she asked
 if we had ever seen a honeycomb before
 we said "No" .So then she went in and 
 got one to show us.                   
 In the afternoon we performed our     
 Penrose play and talked to the        
 St.Levan children.We enjoyed our      
 visit to St.Levan very much.
