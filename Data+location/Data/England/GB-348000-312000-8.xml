		<title>08INDUSTRY IN SHREWSBURY.</title>
		<content>    Shrewsbury isn't very industrial.  
 It hasn't got many industries,only    
 about eight factories in the town     
 centre.We found that there are two    
 main types of industry;{engineering   
 and{food processing.}The largest      
 engineers are{Perkins}who make large  
 diesel engines for the Army.The rest  
 are agricultural engineers.There are  
 two other industries;{Family Loaf}the 
 bakers who make lots of bread and     
{Albrew Maltsters}who make malt out of 
 barley.                               
    Around Shrewsbury there are lots of
 farms and they keep the{agricultural  
 industries in business. The farms     
 produce wheat and barley for the bread
 and malt industries. They also provide
 the market for the farming equipment  
 produced by the agricultural          
 engineers.                            
                                       </content>
