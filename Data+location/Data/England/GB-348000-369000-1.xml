		<content> Our block is very much a rural area.  
 There is only one main centre of      
 housing and that is the village of    
 Ashton.About 2 km to the north of     
 Ashton is Mouldsworth village and     
 part of Manley but these areas are far
 more scattered.The rest of our area is
 farmland with a number of farms here  
 and there.Through the very centre of  
 our block runs the main  Chester to   
 Manchester railway line.There is one  
 passenger station at Mouldsworth. The 
 village of Ashton is split into two   
 halves by the main road, most of the  
 community buildings are situated along
 this main road, and they include the  
 school, the parish church, the        
 community centre and the W.I.hall.    
 Ashton is a nice quiet village, it is 
 set in the countryside.It is very good
 for spotting animals like badgers and 
 foxes.                                </content>
