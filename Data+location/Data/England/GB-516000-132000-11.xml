		<content> In our area we have a railway station 
 called Littlehaven, 3 regular bus     
 services, one garage which sells and  
 services cars and a new Northern      
 Bypass is being built.  The train     
 services on the main Victoria Line to 
 the North mainly stop at Gatwick,     
 Crawley, East Croydon, Clapham        
 Junction and Victoria.  British Rail  
 are changing the barriers at          
 Littlehaven Station and are also going
 to change the level of the crossing.  
 The main stations to the South of     
 Littlehaven are Horsham, Bognor Regis 
 and Portsmouth.  There is one garage  
 which sells and services all cars     
 called "County Croft Cars".  There are
 2 bus companies that run buses        
 regularly through our block.  They are
 Southdown and the privately owned     
 Tillingbourne.
