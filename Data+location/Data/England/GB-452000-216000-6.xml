		<content> The{railway}line between Bicester and 
 Oxford runs across the south-east     
 corner of the area surveyed. It has   
 recently been made single track and is
 now only used for occasional goods    
 traffic.  There are plans to use it   
 more heavily in the near future to    
 transport rubbish from Bristol to the 
 Calvert Brickworks near Aylesbury.    
                                       
 There is only a Saturday bus service  
 into Weston and this is a source of   
 discontent in the village.  The South 
 Midlands Bus Company operates a daily 
 service to Oxford which uses the A43. 
 Villagers wishing to use this service 
 are obliged to walk along the main    
 road to a bus stop at the round-about.
 The Parish Council provides a midweek 
 bus once a month for old people. Some 
 residents operate a volunteer car     
 scheme for essential services.        </content>
