 you picked a ticket from a drum.If    
 your ticket number was on a prize,you 
 won that prize.There was a welly      
 throwing game where you tried  to     
 throw a wellington the furthest.Raffle
 tickets,cakes,toffee apples, biscuits,
 jams etc were sold.A board had jars on
 and you had to throw ping-pong balls  
 into them to win the money.           
 The entrance fee to the Fayre was 50p.

 was scones,cakes,and a cup of tea.
