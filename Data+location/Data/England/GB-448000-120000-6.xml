		<title>06Methodists in Colden Common</title>
		<content> There has been a Methodist Church in  
 the village for 120 years.The ministry
 is shared with Chandlers Ford and the 
 minister is resident in that          
 settlement,a fact he regrets.         
 This is a very active church with 80  
 adults and children attending         
 regularly,rising to 110 on festivals. 
 Membership has risen from 11 in 1978  
 to 46 in 1985.                        
 The Church also organises a number of 
 clubs and societies for all ages,     
 including Boy's Brigade,Brownies and  
 Guides,Youth Club and Women's Club.   
 Like his Anglican counterpart,the     
 minister stresses the need for church 
 involvement in people's lives,        
 providing worship and fellowship for  
 all members of the community.
