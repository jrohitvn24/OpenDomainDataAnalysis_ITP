 farmhouses whose owners control much  
 of the land in the area.              
{Ashwell}is a former{medieval market   
 centre which has declined in the      
 modern period but is now a wealthy

 and has many buildings of historical  
 interest.It is an educational centre  
 for schools and attracts a few adult
