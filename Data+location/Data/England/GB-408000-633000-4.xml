		<title>04Sheep and Cattle Farming</title>
		<content> Where possible the farmers choose to  
 grow crops but certain areas are      
 unsuitable and it is unprofitable to  
 use the land in this way.These areas  
 are the more hilly regions where the  
 soils are not good enough to support  
 the growth of commercial-type crops   
 and the valley floor areas which are  
 too wet and boggy to be used for crop 
 production. They are therefore turned 
 over to sheep and cattle farming, the 
 former on the hilly slopes and craggy 
 outcrops and the latter in the low    
 lying but unproductive valley floors. 
 There is little or no dairy farming in
 the area. The cattle are reared for   
 beef and stock. They are fed on silage
 and haylage produced on the farms.    
 There is little other livestock reared
 on the farms although most farms have 
 free range hens and some rear horses  
 for racing, showing and riding.       </content>
