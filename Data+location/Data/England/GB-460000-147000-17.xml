		<content> In this area there are 3 post offices.
 We can communicate by sending letters 
 and postcards. There is 1 post office 
 in Cliddesden, 1 at Brighton Hill and 
 1 at Kempshott.                       
  There are 2 CB radios in Cliddesden  
 that we know of and many at Brighton  
 Hill and Kempshott. There are         
 several amateur radios in Kempshott   
 and Brighton Hill but there are none  
 in Cliddesden.                        
  There is one telephone box in        
 Cliddesden by the pond, there         
 are several in Brighton hill and      
 Kempshott but we do not know how many.
 In this area there are lots of        
 different papers and magazines. Here  
 is a list of some of them: Cliddesden 
 Newsletter, Basingstoke Gazette,      
 Standard and the Hill and Dale. Also  
 some companies have their own papers  
 e.g. Parkers (Estate Agents)          </content>
