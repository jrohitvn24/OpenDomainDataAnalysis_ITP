		<title>12RELIGION, NORTH CREAKE</title>
		<content> The Church of England's St Mary's     
 Church is the only one to survive, in 
 the village.  Roman Catholic and      
 Methodist services are held in Burnham
 Market.  The Rectorial living of N    
 Creake was the richest in the Diocese 
 of Norwich, before all benifices were 
 re-allocated.  The Church of England  
 has been compelled by shortage of     
 clergymen to return to the system of  
 plurality that was once such a        
 scandal; requiring one priest to have 
 several parishes in his care. The N   
 Creake Rector is Priest-in-Charge of  
 six.                                  
 As well as the difficulties of travel 
 during Norfolk winters, he copes with 
 the variations in the order of service
 that are expected from one church to  
 the next. The oldest church, St       
 Michael's on the Mount, was closed at 
 the Dissolution; very little remains. </content>
