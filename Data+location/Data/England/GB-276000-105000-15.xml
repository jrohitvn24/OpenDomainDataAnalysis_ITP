		<content> A flourishing playgroup meets 2       
 mornings each week in the hall.For    
 those of school age there are Scout   
 and Guide groups,Girls's Brigade and a
 church choir.Occasionaly a concert or 
 pantomime will draw in many from all  
 age groups.About 40 members support   
 the gardening club,which organises an 
 annual show.The London Inn a skittle  
 alley,while some prefer to join the   
 British Legion or Women's Institute.  
 There is no 'common land' for walking 
 and few have time or energy for a     
 leisurely stroll,but some more hardy  
 souls pass through the village which  
 has a stone to mark the halfway point 
 on the Two Moors Way between Dartmoor 
 and Exmoor.Some of the farming        
 community enjoy a day's hunting and   
 the annual hunt ball.Most spend their 
 leisure time at home watching T.V..
