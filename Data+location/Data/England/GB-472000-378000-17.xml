		<title>17THE MEDIA IN GROVE</title>
		<content> In the field of Local Radio,most      
 people appear to select B.B.C.Radio   
 Lincolnshire,of which reception is    
 very good.Lincoln is only 25 miles    
 away and to many villagers is the     
 local shopping centre.During the      
 Autumn of 1985,Commercial Radio is    
 expected to be officially represented 
 in the area,with the extended coverage
 of Radio Hallam,based in Sheffield.In 
 television,both the East Midland Area 
 and the Northern Area transmissions   
 can be well received.Local            
 preferance,however,is for the BBC     
 North and commercial Yorkshire        
 television programmes.All the people  
 interviewed agreed that in the absence
 of local entertainment,television was 
 watched almost daily,particularly in  
 winter.Little mention of the Grove    
 area was recorded in the local papers.
