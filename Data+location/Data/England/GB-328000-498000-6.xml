		<content>    The{farmers}obviously work the land
 within our area, and others find      
 employment from the{tourist industry, 
{forestry,}and{quarrying.}Most people, 
 however, with the exceptions already  
 noted, have to travel to their        
 employment.                           
    A wide variety of occupations is to
 be found outside those associated with
 agriculture, e.g.{shipyard}workers for
 Vickers in Barrow (a journey of 25    
 miles), tradesmen servicing the needs 
 of the tourist industry, i.e.         
{plumbers, electricians, painters}and  
{decorators, joiners}and{builders.     
 Workers regularly commute to such     
 centres as{Barrow, Ulverston,         
{Ambleside}and{Kendal.}A scattering of 
 professional people choose to live in 
 the area and travel long distances to 
 work.                                 
                                       </content>
