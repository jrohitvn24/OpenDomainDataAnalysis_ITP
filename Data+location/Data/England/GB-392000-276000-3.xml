		<title>03THE VILLAGE CHURCH _ TODAY</title>
		<content>   {Belbroughton} church is today a    
 place for prayer and is used by the   
 people in the village for Sunday      
 services, marriages, baptisms and     
 funerals and occasionally by visiting 
 choral societies who come to give a   
 recital.                              
   There is a bell tower with a clock  
 erected in celebration of Queen       
 Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. There are 
 six bells which are still rung        
 regularly and a large organ which was 
 rebuilt in 1955.                      
   The church stands in a large        
 churchyard with many beautiful trees  
 and the main approach to the church is
 through a lyche gate.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
