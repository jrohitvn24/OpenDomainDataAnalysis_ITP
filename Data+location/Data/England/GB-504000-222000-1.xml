		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE BLOCK</title>
		<content> Largely residential,this block covers 
 an area of Luton that has grown very  
 quickly since World War 2.Closer to   
 the town centre,properties are pre 1st
 War and inter-War,but the majority of 
 squares in the block contain recent   
 developments.Two of the most important
 roads in the County run through the   
 block,Dunstable Road,which joins Luton
 to Dunstable,which at peak hours is   
 one of the busiest roads in the South 
 of England and the M1 Motorway.Luton  
 and Dunstable General Hospital,with   
 its specialised accident service is on
 the Motorway junction and close by are
 several Hotels,catering for the       
 Traveller.Because of the rapid growth 
 in the block,there are many           
 schools,but comparatively litle       
 industry.Since W.W.2,people from many 
 other lands have come to live in Luton
 mainly from Asia and the West Indies. </content>
