		<title>20E.of OFFCHURCH - CONCLUSION.</title>
		<content>   No town or large village! No shops, 
 churches, schools - how uninteresting?
   We thought so at first.  But then we
 went exploring and found an area rich 
 in history - the Roman{Fosse Way,}the 
{Welsh Drovers' Road,}the little green 
 lane called the{Ridgeway,}a page from 
 the past.                             
   We found varied{habitats}for an     
 abundance of{wildlife.                
   We saw modern farming methods and   
 discovered a{Cellular radio mast.     
   We talked to people enjoying        
 themselves picking fruit and to local 
 residents of{Offchurch}and nearby who 
 made us welcome in their homes.       
   Yes! We've enjoyed surveying such an
 interesting part of England.{
