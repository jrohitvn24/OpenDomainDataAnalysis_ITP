		<content> The 5 main churches in Enfield town   
 are: The Church of England, Baptist,  
 Evangelical, Methodist, &amp; Roman       
 Catholic. The C. of E. is the oldest, 
 one part is 795 years old. During the 
 2nd World War, the Evangelical Church 
 was bombed so the building is newer.  
 The C. of E. has the most Sunday      
 Services, 5. Most of the others have  
 between 2 &amp; 4. The age range of Sunday
 School is 3 - 21 years. All the       
 churches said that over the last 10   
 years their congregations had         
 increased, so had Baptisms,           
 Dedications, Confirmations &amp; Weddings.
 Nearly all hold joint services with   
 other denominations. We did a survey  
 in Enfield. We asked 140 people if    
 they went to chuch, 50% said no, 25%  
 said yes, 25% said sometimes.         
                                       
                                       </content>
