		<title>19Prestwood  Children's Height</title>
		<content>We asked children in our Survey to     
indicate their height. These are the   
results:                               
      {Average Height in Metres}       
                                       
Age:         Girls         Boys        
                                       
 8-8.11      1.28          1.31        
 9-9.11      1.34          1.38        
10-10.11     1.37          1.44        
11-11.11     1.48          1.49        
                                       
Although in each year, boys were on    
average taller than girls, the eleven  
year old girls were much taller than   
the ten year old girls.  We graphed the
values, and there's a {sudden} increase
in their height between 10 and 11, but 
the boys increase in height is gradual 
and even throughout this age range.    
Maybe the boys will have a sudden      
increase in growth later.              </content>
