 Bleasdale Parish Hall was built by    
 voluntary labour.It was built from    
 stones brought from the ruins of      
 cottages of the village of Coolam.This
 was a hamlet near Hazlehurst where the
 inhabitants used to make hats,woven   
 from oat straw and also do wool       
 combing.                              
                                       
 The Parish Hall has a sprung maple    
 floor for dancing,and a large stage.It
 was improved in 1984.
