		<title>14A VILLAGE MUM'S DAY - 2</title>
		<content>  It's nearly 9 a.m. and the children, 
 ready for school, are playing outside 
 while I peg out the washing. At 8.55  
 it's time to check for dinner money,  
 reading books, crisps and recorders.  
 Everything is in order and off we go.{
 Though{Haresfield}village is quite    
 small, the road at this time is very  
 busy and I like to take the children  
 over it. After standing in the        
 playground for a short time, it's     
 goodbye until 3 p.m.                  
  I like to start the housework as soon
 as I get in but can't decide whether  
 to work indoors or out. The arrival of
 a friend solves the problem for we    
 have coffee. After she leaves, the dog
 keeps looking at me and I decide to   
 take her into the fields before it    
 gets too hot. She is pleased that I am
 picking up her lead. We go through the
 orchard and onto the barley field.    </content>
