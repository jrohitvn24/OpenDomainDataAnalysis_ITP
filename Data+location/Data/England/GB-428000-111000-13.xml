		<title>13Energy in the Home (I)</title>
		<content> All homes have electricty with over   
 60% having both electricity and gas.  
 The major use of electricity is for   
 heating. The second most popular fuel 
 is gas, and then wood. A minority use 
 coal or oil for heating.              
    Nearly all the homes have some     
 double glazing with nearly half those 
 surveyed having full double glazing.  
 Loft insulation is the second most    
 popular method of conserving energy.  
 The most dramatic change that has     
 occurred in the use of energy during  
 the post war period is to power       
 electrical gadgets. Every home        
 surveyed owned at least one TV, with  
 some having 2 or 3. Other electrically
 powered items that have become        
 fixtures in almost all homes are      
 refridgerators, cookers, kettles,     
 washing machines, hair driers and     
 irons.                                </content>
