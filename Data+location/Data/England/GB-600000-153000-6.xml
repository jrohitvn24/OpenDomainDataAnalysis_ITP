 The 5th Earl Sondes lives at Stringman
 Farm and is concerned with preserving 
 the rural character of his estate much
 of which is An Area of Outstanding    
 Natural Beauty.  The Estate runs the  
 local pheasant shoot.  No exact data  
 is available (fear of disruption by   
 Animal Rights Groups is given as      
 reason for non disclosure of facts)   
 but is is estimated that some         
 lO-l4,OOO birds are raised annually   
 and the cost of a daily gun is approx.
 Â£l5OO, for mainly Americans and other 
 overseas visitors.  Cheryl Fountain,  
 daughter of the Sondes Estate         
 Gamekeeper, is a notable artist living
 in Lords Cottages.   She exhibits     
 regularly at the Royal Academy.
