		<content>As with most birdwatching and wildlife 
sites, what one sees depends largely on
being at the right place at the right  
time. To see the Common's wide variety 
of birdlife would involve several      
visits spaced over the year and a large
helping of good luck! However, even the
casual visitor would be aware of the   
rich birdlife, unless he walked through
the Common in Summer-then, insect bites
would be uppermost in his mind! The    
full range of species appears in many  
birdwatching journals. The Common is   
particularly renowned for its colonies 
of black-headed gulls. The nature lover
may also enjoy the wide variety of     
trees, plants and fungi which grow in  
abundance. The large Fly Agaric        
Toadstool is another interesting       
feature but beware-it's poisonous!
