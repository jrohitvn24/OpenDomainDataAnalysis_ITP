		<title>20BAILIFF BRIDGE</title>
		<content> Bailiff Bridge is a very old place. In
 the middle of the crossroads there was
 a fountain. Horses used to drink from 
 the fountain. There also used to be a 
 railway station and it was up Birkby  
 Lane. One day a truck caught fire and 
 crashed into the station and,with the 
 station having gas heaters, it blew   
 up. Trams used to run to Bailiff      
 Bridge but they stopped by the Punch  
 Bowl and then started again by the    
 newsagents. You had to change trams   
 because the size of the lines were    
 different. One day a lorry rolled down
 the hill slowly and then faster and   
 faster. The man who owned the shop was
 not hurt but the driver of the lorry  
 was killed and so was a lady who had  
 gone in for her pension.
