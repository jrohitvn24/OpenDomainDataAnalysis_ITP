  On the school field we have an annual
 carnival.1985's carnival was on June  
 1st. and some of the stalls were run  
 by the children from the school.One of
 the things there was a Fun Castle     
 which is an inflated toy which you pay
 to bouce on.It costs 30p for ten      
 minutes play on it.There was a        
 welly_wagging game where people tried 
 to throw wellington boots further than
 each other for a prize.The main       
 attraction is the Carnival procession,
 when different clubs and societies    
 enter a decorated lorry to join in    
 the fun.The profit made goes to the   
 school funds to buy more expensive    
 equipment for the school.
