		<title>05FELTWELL'S COMMUNICATIONS</title>
		<content>   Feltwell is between Thetford, Ely   
 and Downham Market. It is not on any  
 major route but two 'B' roads pass    
 through. They are the Blll2 from      
 Methwold to Barton Mills and the B1386
 which runs from the A10 at Southery to
 Brandon. The Wilton Road (B1112 South)
 is the busiest with 170 vehicles per  
 hour. The Methwold Hythe Road has the 
 least traffic with 58 vehicles per    
 hour. Feltwell has three buses each   
 day to Hockwold, Brandon and Thetford,
 with one going through to Bury St     
 Edmunds. Another bus goes through to  
 Downham Market. Several private buses 
 are used by firms to take their       
 workers. Private buses also take      
 children to Methwold High School.     
 Quite a lot of people never use the   
 public bus service.                   
   The nearest railway station is at   
 Lakenheath, on the Ely-Norwich line.  </content>
