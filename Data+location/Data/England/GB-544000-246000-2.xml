		<title>02A day in the life of Mrs B.</title>
		<content> On a working day everybody helps to   
 make the packed lunches, as well as   
 their own beds. I drive from          
 Whittlesford to work through the      
 country lanes and it's always         
 difficult to park in Cambridge.       
 Sometimes, as an architect, I have to 
 meet builders on building sites to    
 talk about problems, or the work they 
 have to do. In the office I work out  
 colours for the inside of my next     
 project. I have been working on the   
 design of a school for handicapped    
 children. Sometimes I shop at         
 lunch-time, but in summer Cambridge is
 very crowded with tourists. I leave   
 work earlier than most people in the  
 practice, to meet the children from   
 school. Sometimes we go to the Library
 or swimming classes. I may cook cakes 
 in the evening, or play tennis.
