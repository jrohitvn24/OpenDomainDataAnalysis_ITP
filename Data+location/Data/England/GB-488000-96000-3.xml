		<title>03THE WRECK</title>
		<content> On a suuny June afternoon on a        
 deserted beach by Marine Park Gardens,
 we went to have a close look at 'The  
 Wreck'.  This is a large concrete     
 slab, 20 x 5 metres, with a hole in   
 the middle.  It should have been used 
 during World War II as part of a {    
{Mulberry Harbour.}As there were no    
 harbours they could use, the Allies   
 floated artificial harbours made of   
 concrete across the channel and sank  
 them off the French coast.  The wreck 
 is part of a slab that was broken off 
 in a storm whilst waiting to be towed 
 to France.  There is a larger piece in
 the sea off Pagham beach, which people
 swim out to.                          
 The wreck looks as though it is the   
 skeleton of a dinosaur or the wreck of
 an ordinary ship with the ribs        
 showing.                              
                                       </content>
