		<content> Apart from farming, there a few       
 sources of employment. A joiner's yard
 near Loud Higher Bridge employs a     
 dozen men and a restaurant at         
 Blacksticks Farm provides casual,     
 part-time employment for women and    
 ypung people. There is a small,       
 family-run horticultural nursery at   
 New House near Stony Lane Farm and at 
 Lyndeth, near Barns Fold, Arab horses 
 are bred, on a small scale. Many      
 people work outside the area, usually 
 in the professions or in mamagement. A
 high-school teacher, a surgeon, a     
 consultant engineer and a sales       
 representative are typical of those   
 who live here but work elsewhere.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
