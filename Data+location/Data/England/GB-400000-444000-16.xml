		<title>16STEETON TRAFFIC CENSUS:2</title>
		<content>   A record was made of the cargoes the
 lorries carried these fell into       
 several categories,food (meat, cakes, 
 frozen products,fruit), building      
 materials (windows, wood, cement,     
 timber, paint), machine parts,wool for
 textiles and livestock (cattle,sheep, 
 poultry). Most of the lorries had     
 travelled from the industrial areas of
 West and South Yorkshire.             
   Apart from the volume of traffic the
 noise and air pollution was           
 considerable causing discomfort to the
 survey teams on both sides of the     
 road.                                 
   Due to the large number of vehicles 
 on this road tail backs of up to 1    
 mile can occur.The A65 is a major road
 which requires careful replanning to  
 ensure a smooth traffic flow in the   
 future.
