 Progress way is a fairly old area     
 containing many varied industries. All
 of the sites are used as storage      
 depots or warehouses and those that   
 are not in this category are not used.
 The average workforce in these depots 
 is about twenty and there are many    
 different goods stored there.These    
 include electrical goods,foodstuffs,  
 windows and Wimpy,the builders        
 obviously store building materials.   
 Wimpy is the biggest employer with    
 about one hundred employees and the   
 smallest is Francis Little and Sons   
 who only employ three people.The goods
 are distributed locally,throughout    
 Britain and all over the world.
