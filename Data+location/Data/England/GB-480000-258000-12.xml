		<title>12DENTON ... the past.</title>
		<content>   The stream which used to flow       
 through the village has now been      
 culvetted. However in the past there  
 was intense{rivalry}between those     
 living on opposite sides. Stepping    
 stones had to be negotiated to cross  
 from one side to the other and it     
 would not be uncommon to see grown men
{brawling on either bank.              
   At one time the village had its own 
 blacksmith and baker plus a few shoe  
 makers. One story equally rooted in   
 the past concerns a man caught in the 
{Red Lion pub during a storm.}Fearing  
 perhaps the worst if he arrived home  
 late, he borrowed a barrel and floated
 down the main street.                 
   Opposite the Red Lion a wide archway
 bears testament to an old coaching    
 Inn. Later it was used as a{bakehouse;
 well attended by men on Sundays who   
 enjoyed a pint as lunch cooked.       </content>
