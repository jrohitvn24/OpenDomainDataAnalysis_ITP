		<content>Next door to school is Hindley House a 
home for 25 old people of 60 and over. 
It opened in 1968 and has a waiting    
list of people wanting to get in. A    
warden is in charge of people aged 61- 
84. The building suffers from vandal-  
ism. Also badly behaved children       
frighten the old people by climbing on 
their fire-escape and shouting loudly. 
Further along the road is St. Clements 
Court, a collection of sheltered accom-
modation flats. Jamie's mum works      
there. People stay independent paying  
a weekly rent and have their own keys  
and door. Ladies are over 60, men over 
65. The eldest resident is 87. Flats   
have both a lift and stairs and are    
protected from vandals. A warden is on 
hand to help when needed. Old people   
like living here.
