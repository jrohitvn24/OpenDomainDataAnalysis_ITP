		<content> May day celebrations are very old in  
 the area.In the past children made may
 sticks and sang a special may song at 
 front doors. The celebrations have    
 been revived within the last 10       
 years.Now a May Queen is crowned and  
 she is paraded around the village by  
 the Morris men and children carrying  
 Maysticks. The May Queen is chosen by 
 th children of the village from the   
 oldest girls at the primary school.   
 The May Queen wears a white long dress
 and a crown of spring flowers and she 
 carries a corn dolly staff.
