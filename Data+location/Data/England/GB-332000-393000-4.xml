		<title>04UNEMPLOYMENT.</title>
		<content>  {Unemployment}is a problem in our    
 area.There are{33%}of adults without a
 job.They have to sign on the dole.They
 have to report to their local social  
 security office every two weeks to    
 sign their name.They are then given   
 money by the government so they can   
 live.A single adult gets{Â£25.75}and   
 they can get their rent paid and money
 for clothes and furniture.            
 The reason why there are so many      
{unemployed}in{Bootle}is because there 
 is not enough work.People have left   
 their jobs because factories have     
 closed down and they became redundant.
 Many factories and the docks too are  
 using machines to do the work instead 
 of men.People who are on the dole get 
 fed up and depressed because they     
 can't work.They get bored because they
 have nothing to do.{(Ellen Denholm.)}
