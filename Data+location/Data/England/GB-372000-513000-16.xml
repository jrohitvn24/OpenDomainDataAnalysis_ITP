		<title>16A day in the life of Geoff</title>
		<content> My dad Geoff Longrigg, farms at Mere  
 Bank, Bleatarn. His dad and brother   
 are farmers too. He wakes up at about 
 6.00 a.m. and gets in the cows for    
 milking. After milking he has his     
 breakfast at about 9.00. He usually   
 has a cooked breakfast of egg and     
 bacon. After breakfast he mucks out   
 the byre and often spreads the muck   
 and slurry on to the field before     
 having his bait - sandwiches and      
 coffee. Depending on the time of year 
 he then goes silaging or haytiming or 
 hedging. My dad is a birdwatcher and  
 tries to make the hedges better for   
 birds to live in. On Tuesdays he goes 
 to the auction at Penrith.He has his  
 tea when we come home from school then
 sees to the sheep and calves. He has  
 supper at 6.30 p.m., and if there's   
 time, goes bird watching.
