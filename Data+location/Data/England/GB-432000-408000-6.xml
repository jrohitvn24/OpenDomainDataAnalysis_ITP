		<content> There are some well cared for nature  
 parks and gardens which provide homes 
 for {swifts, song thrushes, mistle    
{thrushes, blackbirds, house martins,  
{blue tits, wrens, chaffinches, robins,
  and{collared dove.}There are also    
 some very untidy gardens which give   
 homes to the invertebrates that feed  
 the birds but also encourage{brown    
{rats}and{house mice.}Cats prey on     
 these and the garden birds. There are 
 some large ponds stocked for coarse   
 fishing with{mute swans, moorhens,    
{coots, mallards, water voles, common  
{frogs, toads}and{common newts.}A      
 stream runs through the grassland     
 where frogs are also found. We think  
 it likely that {grass snakes}also live
 here.{Swallows}fly over the water     
 catching insects.
