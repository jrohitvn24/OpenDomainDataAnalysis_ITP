		<title>01General Review of Area.</title>
		<content> Our area is situated  on the east     
 coast of the Borough of               
 Sunderland,immediately to the south of
 the River Wear.Almost 2/3rds. of the  
 area to the east is covered by the    
 North Sea.The western quarter of the  
 block is largely taken up by the      
 residential housing of varying types  
 and age.Two railway lines run through 
 the area.One is the main              
 Teeside-Tyneside line and the other   
 is a branch from Ryhope Grange        
 Junction to the Docks.This latter line
 is used almost entirely to transport  
 coalfrom local pits to the docks for  
 transhipment to power stations on the 
 River Thames.The Docks are used much  
 less than in their heyday,but still   
 provide a source of employment in an  
 area of very high unemployment.
