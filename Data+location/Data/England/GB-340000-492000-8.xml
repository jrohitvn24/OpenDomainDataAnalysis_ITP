		<content> During the last two decades the       
 pattern of life in towns is changed:  
 dwellers in towns can now afford to   
 buy old cottages, refurbish them and  
 use them for weekends and holidays.   
 Although this does give a more        
 prosperous appearance, it prevents    
 local people from getting a home in   
 the land where they have grown up,    
 because such cottages attract high    
 prices. This valley has many such     
 homes, which makes life for the       
 scattered and some elderly residents  
 lonely in the winter. The village     
 school was made into a bungalow in the
 most attractive way but is at the     
 moment up for sal, for after being    
 restored by a local man, resold, and  
 again offered at a price so high that 
 no young couple could possibly afford 
 to buy.                               
                                       </content>
