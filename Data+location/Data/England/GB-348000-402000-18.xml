		<content>   The most common newspaper read was  
the Liverpool Echo which is an evening 
paper. Of the Daily papers the Mirror, 
Sun and Star have equal demand; of the 
Sunday papers the News of the World was
by far, the most popular.              
   Most households buy a weekly        
magazine, the most popular are Woman   
and Woman's Own, Jackie, and the old   
faithfuls the Dandy and the Beano.     
   Everyone listens to the local       
commercial radio station on a regular  
basis. Items on it lead to conversation
topics as much as TV.                  
   TV is the centre of family life and 
plays a big role in peoples lives. The 
most popular are the soap operas (most 
activities on Monday and Wednesday     
start after 8p.m.). Sport and Nature   
programmes are next most popular.      
   The Library is well used by all ages
and all backgrounds.                   </content>
