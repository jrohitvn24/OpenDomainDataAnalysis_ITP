		<content> THIS PART OF THE COMMON IS VERY STEEP 
 IN PLACES. PEOPLE WALK THEIR DOGS AND 
 RIDE HORSES WHILE SHEEP QUIETLY       
 GRAZE AROUND THE DISUSED QUARRIES.    
 ON THE HIGHER, FLATTER GROUND GOLFERS 
 ENJOY THE BEAUTIFULLY SITED BUT       
 EXPOSED GOLF COURSE.                  
 THE POSTLIP VALLEY IS  A WIDE EXPANSE 
 OF SHELTERED DOWNLAND WITH DEEP       
 VALLEYS .AT POSTLIP ABOVE A SMALL POND
 KNOWN AS THE WASHPOOL THERE IS A      
 SPRING THAT RARELY DRIES UP           
 BECAUSE OF THE POROUS SAND AND        
 LIMESTONE SOIL.THE STREAM RUNS        
 THROUGH AN OLD SHEEPDIP.A PAPER MILL  
 AT POSTLIP HAS MADE FILTER PAPERS     
 SINCE THE 18TH CENTURY. POSTLIP WARREN
 IS REACHED BY A LONG AVENUE OF TREES. 
 A ROMAN CATHOLIC CHAPEL IN THE GROUNDS
 IS OF OF THE NORMAN PERIOD.IT         
 WAS RESTORED IN THE 19TH CENTURY.
