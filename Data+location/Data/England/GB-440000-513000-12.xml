		<title>12INTERVIEW WITH MRS. PUNTINS</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Puntins said she'd known the   
 area for sixteen years. It had        
 expanded a great deal and more houses 
 have been built. The roads are just   
 about the same, but transport has     
 changed because there are many more   
 cars and lorries coming up and down   
 the streets. The two most useful      
 modern inventions are television and  
 central heating. Mrs. Puntins has one 
 son and two daughters, and she has    
 just become a great grandmother.The   
 war affected her family quite a lot.  
 Her three brothers came home safely   
 but two cousins were killed and one   
 nephew was a prisoner of war in a     
 concentration camp for four years.    
 Since Mrs. Puntins was a little girl  
 she thinks family life has changed for
 the better. Entertainment used to be a
 jam sandwich and a bottle of pop.
