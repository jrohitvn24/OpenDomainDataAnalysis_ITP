		<title>14POPULATION</title>
		<content> There are fewer than 500 people living
 in this block which is just less than 
 5 square miles in area and 2 of the   
 grid squares have no people at all.   
 Out of such a small population it is  
 remarkable how long-lived many are    
 particularly among the indigenous     
 families.Between  1900 and 1929 there 
 were 108 burials in Westbury, 12 of   
 babies less than a year but 13 were 60
 to 70, 35 were 70 to 80 and 22 were   
 over 80.These were all born in the    
 early 19th.c. in very hard conditons. 
 At the same time there were 34        
 marriages in Westbury whilst 79 boys  
 and 58 girls were christened. Today   
 there may be 2 or 3 christenings, 1   
 wedding and 1 or 2 funerals a year.   
 Although only a few new houses have   
 been built there has been an influx of
 population so that today only about \ 
 the families predate the 1931 change. </content>
