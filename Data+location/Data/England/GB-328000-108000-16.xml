		<title>16My Daily Diet by Louisa</title>
		<content>{Breakfast}for me means a bowl of      
 cereal, usually Rice Crispies.To go   
 with my cereal I have a cup of tea.I  
 sometimes have a boiled egg when we   
 have run out of cereal.               
 At{first break}at school I have       
 some fruit ,usually an apple of which 
 I like Granny Smiths best.            
 For my{lunch}I bring chocolate spread 
 sandwiches and a packet of crisps,I   
 like prawn cocktail flavour best.I    
 sometimes have a chocolate biscuit.   
 I have some biscuits{after school.  } 
 Then at 6.00p.m. we have our{main meal
 We have a set menu which means we     
 have something different every night  
 but the same every week.On Mondays    
 we have a roast and on Fridays we     
 buy fish and chips from "The Copper   
 Kettle" restaurant to eat at home.    
 At bedtime I have a cup of tea.
