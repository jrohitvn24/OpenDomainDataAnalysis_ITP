		<content> The area is characterised by broadly  
 rolling farmland at about 450ft OD    
 falling away to the Cherwell valley in
 the east and dissected by the River   
 Dorn and its tributary the Cockley    
 Brook in the west. The soil is        
 cornbrash, deeply stained by iron in  
 the northern half, with outcrops of   
 sand to the north of Horsehay Farm and
 alluvium in the valleys; considerable 
 deposits of glacial clay occur as     
 scattered pockets. The area has       
 escaped the worst effects of intensive
 modern agriculture and the fields,    
 resulting from the Enclosures Act, are
 small with many intact heges. Although
 woodland is sparse the river valleys  
 are rich in wildlife due to diverse   
 habitats of marsh and old pasture.
