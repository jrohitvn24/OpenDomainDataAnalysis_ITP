		<title>19Talking to an octogenarian.</title>
		<content> March 1985.Mr.O.Priestly came to      
 Cockfield School to tell us of his    
 life in our area.He told us that he   
 was one of 15 children.He started     
 school at 5 yrs and had to walk 3 mls.
 there and back.There was no school    
 transport only farmers and rich people
 had horses and traps.His family       
 walked every where.At the age of 14 he
 started work in a mine which was very 
 dark and pit ponies were used to pull 
 coal trucks.His pay was very low.     
 Mr.Priestly remembered being caned at 
 school when he was naughty and said   
 that this punishment was to teach him 
 to behave well. He remembers living in
 the war when food was in short supply 
 and even clothes were rationed.       
 Mr.Priestly told us of the hardship of
 his mothers wash day,and that he was  
 quite a mature person before he ate   
 'bought'bread.He's seen many changes. </content>
