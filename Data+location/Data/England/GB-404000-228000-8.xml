		<title>08FARMING, HAILES</title>
		<content> The farms in this area show great     
 variety, ranging from wholly arable,  
 through mixed stock and arable to     
 wholly stock farming. The relief of   
 the land varies from flat to hilly.   
 Some of the flatland is high and      
 exposed. Elsewhere it is low and      
 sheltered. The high flat land is      
 suitable for arable farming, the low  
 land for arable and fruit. Sheep      
 farming is mainly confined to the     
 hilly land. Farms vary in size from   
 150 to 350 acres. Some farms are      
 rented, others are owner-occupied. The
 crops grown include wheat, barley,    
 beans, hay and triticale. Sheep       
 provide the main form of livestock.   
 There are also some pigs, poultry and 
 beef cattle. There is no dairy        
 farming.
