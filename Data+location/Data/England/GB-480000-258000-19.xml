		<content>   The{Church}was built sometime in the
 12th or 13th Century erected on some  
 high ground over looking a fine sweep 
 of the{NENE.}From the church tower,   
 without too much trouble, one can see{
{Castle Ashby}_ home of the Marquess of
 Northampton.                          
   The first known vicar of Brafield   
 was{WILLIELMUS DE GRENDON}in 1281.    
 Towards the end of the 17th Century   
 the parishes of Brafield and Little   
 Houghton were combined.               
   In{1983}a competition was organised 
 in conjunction with the{Church's      
{Restoration Programme}to see who could
 dig the fastest trench; the prize _{a 
{barrel of beer.  }                    
   Repointing of the exterior still    
 continues today. In May, 1984 a 3 day 
 flower festival attended by{Morris Men
 with{craft stalls and competitions    
 helped to swell funds.                </content>
