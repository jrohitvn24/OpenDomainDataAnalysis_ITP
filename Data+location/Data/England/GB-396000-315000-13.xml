    On our visit to the Forest Office  
we learned something of the work       
involved in forestry.                  
    This work involves preparing ground
and planting out the seedlings. Mature 
trees are felled and logged. The young 
plantations are thinned out as the     
trees grow.                            
    Some of this work involves the use 
of heavy machinery, and falling trees  
can be dangerous, so forest workers    
wear special clothing such as helmets, 
visors, ear defenders, gloves and boots
with steel toe caps.                   
    Forest workers are trained by the  
Forestry Commission. The managers have 
received College or University         
training. The courses for special      
qualifications in forestry can last for
up to five years.
