		<content>   This is not an area of high crime.  
{Vandalism}is the most common problem  
 as vandals, usually young people,     
 break up public facilities and        
 disfigure walls.If they are caught    
 they are fined.Because a lot of shops 
 operate a self-service system there is
 an increasing amount of stealing from 
 shops{(shoplifting).}Guilty people    
 are fined.We have a Police Constable  
 living here and police drive through  
 the area in cars.In spite of this     
 there have been{breakins}and          
{burglaries}(about ten in one year),   
 one or two minor{assaults}but no      
{serious crime,}like{murder.}For these 
 offences the guilty are given jail    
 sentences.{Vehicle}drivers commit     
{crime}by parking on double yellow     
 lines (illegal), driving too fast or  
 breaking the law by driving without   
 insurance, road tax or M.O.T. test.   </content>
