		<title>15Wethersfield Village.</title>
		<content>      We went to look at Wethersfield  
 village as it was in our area as well.
     It looked about the same size as  
 our villlage of Finchingfield.Another 
 thing that was the same was that all  
 the older houses are in the very      
 centre of the village and all the     
 newer houses are around the outside.  
     Both villages are set in the      
 middle of arable farmland.Most of the 
 people who live in them work outside  
 of the villages apart from people like
 shopkeepers etc.Quite a few even      
 commute to London,though most work in 
 the surrounding towns and a small     
 number work in Wethersfield Air Base. 
     Wethersfield has a pretty village 
 green at its centre with some large   
 Lime trees on it.                     
     Most of the village is situated   
 wthin a hundred metres of the centre.
