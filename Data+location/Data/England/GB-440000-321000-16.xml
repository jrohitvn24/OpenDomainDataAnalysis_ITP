		<title>16Breedon Primary School</title>
		<content>    In 1985 Breedon Primary School had 
 60 pupils in addendance and 3 teaching
 members of staff and a nursery nurse. 
 The age of entry of the children is 4+
 thus necessitating the aid of the     
 nursery nurse.                        
  The Headteacher is a class teacher   
 and Warden of the Community Center.   
 This is because the school is also a  
 community center for the use of the   
 people of Breedon for recreational and
 social purposes.                      
    The school aims to equip the       
 children with the academic standards, 
 social awarenesses and recreational   
 skills to enable them to progress and 
 enjoy the society of 1985.            
    The children leave the school at   
 the age of 10. They,mostly, then go on
 to the High School at Castle Donington
 which is in a village 5 miles away.
