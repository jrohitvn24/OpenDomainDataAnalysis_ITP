		<title>02THE RACE COURSE</title>
		<content> The first race was held in 1783       
 although there was no stand until     
 1788.The first race was won by a      
 4 year-old called Puff.Things went    
 smoothly until 1805 when the          
 racecourse owner,a local farmer,      
 threatened to plough it up, because   
 the Jockey Club had not paid its rent 
 of a quarter of a pipe of wine (27    
 gallons) for the previous seasons     
 racing.This hurdle was overcome when  
 the Jockey Club sent in a navy        
 pressgang eager to find recruits for  
 the Napoleonic war;this scared the    
 farmhands into running away so the    
 farmer had no one to do the ploughing.
 The stand was destroyed by fire       
 started by a tramp.The new stand was  
 built in 1964.The whole racecourse    
 is on top of the Downs, 2 miles long  
 and horseshoe shaped. Nowadays fairs  
 and markets are held there.           </content>
