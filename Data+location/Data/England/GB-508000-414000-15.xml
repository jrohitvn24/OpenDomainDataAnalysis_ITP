		<content> The fete is in the Summer so that old 
 people can come - it will be warm for 
 them. There is a fancy dress parade   
 and one year I went as a hula girl. I 
 came fourth and won 2O pence.  One    
 of our teachers served at the cake    
 stall near the door. There was a big  
 refreshment stall in the hall and a   
 big toy stall too. One year we bought 
 a sledge from the stall. There are    
 book stalls, comic stalls and a       
 raffle. One year I won a tin of       
 pear-halves and I had them for my tea 
 when I got home that day. We have an  
 Army assault course and I made it on  
 my own without any help from the      
 Cadets who are there to help you and  
 they gave me a clap. It was fun on the
 Army assault course because there are 
 lots of things to do. One of the      
 fathers was selling balloons with gas 
 in them for fifty pence. I bought one.</content>
