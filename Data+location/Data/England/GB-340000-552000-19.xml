		<title>19EMPLOYMENT AND OUR FAMILIES.</title>
		<content>  Carlisle is quite small even though  
 it is the main city in N.W.England. It
 has no polluting industry so the air  
 is clean. A lot of the working members
 of families in our school work at     
 either,Cavray Foods or Goldenlay Eggs 
 on London Road,on the Durranhill      
 Industrial Estate(probably for Robsons
 Border Transport),or in the big       
 department stores in town.Several     
 families in our school live in local  
 public houses owned by Matthew Brown, 
 a local brewery who have been fighting
 a takeover bid by Scottish &amp; Newcastle
 brewery. The Landlords of the pubs    
 expected that if it happened their    
 pubs would be closed.After a struggle 
 M.Brown.stayed free and Pat Cody,     
 Paul's dad,is quoted in the{Cumberland
{News},speaking for all the landlords, 
 "This is great news,there has been a  
 lot of deep worry about our future."  </content>
