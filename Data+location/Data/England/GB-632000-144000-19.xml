		<content> Man's activities have created a number
 of havens for wildlife in the arable  
 landscape. The verges of the A2(T)    
 road and the steep embankment of the  
 Dover_Deal railway cutting are free   
 from man's interference. The former is
 a fine hunting ground for hawks and   
 the latter lined with buckthorn,elder 
 and beech is a perfect habitat for    
 rabbits. 19 runs were found in one 80m
 stretch. The trackbeds of the disused 
 Lt. Railway from Martim Mill to the   
 cliffs are overgrown and are ideal for
 burrowing mammals. The presence of    
 droppings and shotgun cartridges how  
 numerous the rabbits and foxes must   
 be. Scattered around the area are     
 chalk pits from which flints were once
 removed. Useless to the farmer thses  
 areas provide small islands for       
 wildlife in the sea of cereal crops.  
 The predominant insects are woodlice. </content>
