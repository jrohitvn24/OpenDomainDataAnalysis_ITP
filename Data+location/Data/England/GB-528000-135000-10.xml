		<content> I stopped at the Pelican crossing     
 pressed the button and waited for the 
 green man to appear,indicating that I 
 could walk across the road in         
 safety.Iwas early at the bowl,allthe  
 machines were turned off and it was   
 very quiet.Suddenly allthe lanes were 
 turned on and it became very noisy,   
 bowling balls whizzing and the sound  
 of skittles crashing when hit.After I 
 walked back to Queens Square-I wanted 
 to buy a record.The roads were now    
 busy with traffic and the shops were  
 full.Ladies pulling their shopping    
 trollies and some families looking    
 into shopwindows.Many young people    
 gather around the Bandstand and dance 
 to Electro music.The young people all 
 wore different clothes. One in a      
 leather jacket covered in chains and  
 studs and his hair shaved, spiked and 
 brightly coloured others smarter.     </content>
