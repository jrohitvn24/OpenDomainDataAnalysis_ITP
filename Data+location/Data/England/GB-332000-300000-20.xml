		<title>20LIFE STYLES AND CONCLUSION</title>
		<content>This is an area of great natural       
beauty,with some people happy to       
commute daily 15 miles to Shrewsbury to
have the pleasure of living in such    
surroundings.The changing character of 
the area has not meant, however, that  
it has lost its original working class 
roots.The scattered population has a   
very active community spirit, basically
because the area remains one of small  
hill farmers who must recieve help from
neighbours to survive- and in return   
give aid to others.There is a happy mix
of newcomers and the indigenous        
community without any divisions        
between them.The pace of life is rural 
and the  people warm and friendly      
On behalf of Snailbeach WI we would    
especially like to thank Ron           
Kinrade,Dennis and Janet Wilkinson and 
all who gave valuable assistance
