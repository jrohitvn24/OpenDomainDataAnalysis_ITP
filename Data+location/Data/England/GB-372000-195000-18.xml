		<title>18Attitudes in North Nibley.</title>
		<content> The people in North Nibley feel that  
 it is a very friendly and pleasant    
 area to live in.It is a good place to 
 bring up a family as it is safe and   
 healthy.There is easy access to places
 of work ie.Dursley and Gloucester.Many
 people feel that there is no need for 
 more housing as there is no real need 
 for further development.The lack of   
 public transport is a more pressing   
 need.Nibley people tend to look more  
 to Wotton as the centre point.There is
 concern about the relative lack of    
 leisure facilities for the young.Those
 pupils of secondary age go to         
 Katharine Lady Berkeley School,Wotton.
 There is a strong W.I. movement in    
 Nibley which endeavours to improve and
 promote the community way of life,and 
 enrich the appearance of the already  
 beautiful village.
