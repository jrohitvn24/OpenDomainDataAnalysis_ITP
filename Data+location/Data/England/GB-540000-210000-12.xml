		<content> grocer's, a greengrocer, a butcher    
 and a newsagent.                      
                                       
 Parndon Mill offers facilities for    
 craftsmen and there is one shop       
 there for model enthusiasts.          
                                       
                                       
 Little Parndon is poorly off for shops
 compared with other areas of the town.
 It has only one public house - and    
 that has been built only in the past  
 five years, long after the area was   
 developed. Compare this with Roydon's 
 four pubs which, admittedly, survive  
 on outside trade.
