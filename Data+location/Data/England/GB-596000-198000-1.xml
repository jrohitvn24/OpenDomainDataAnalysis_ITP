		<content>{Southminster}grew up around the early{
 Saxon Church.It became the principal  
 village in the Dengie Hundred.Its     
{Weekly Market}served all the villages 
 and the{Railway}terminated here.The{  
{Police Station}and{County Court}were  
 built in 1901 and are still in        
 existence today.The{Manor House}in    
 Station Road was destroyed by a bomb  
 in World War II and this event altered
 the character of Southminster.North   
 Street a busy shopping area was       
 destroyed leaving the High Street to  
 take on the role of the village       
 shopping centre.There are adequate    
 shopping facilities for a small       
 village also outdoor and indoor       
 recreational activities for all ages. 
 The main work available centres round 
 the farms,market gardens and a light  
 industrial estate.Many people commute 
 to towns outside the village.         </content>
