 People grumble that they are bored,but
 there is quite a bit to do locally.   
 It's just that you have to look for   
 it.                                   
                                       
 In the village there is a large       
 playing field with swings,a climbing  
 frame and a slide.                    
                                       
 At school ( in Donington ) there are a
 number of clubs and activities and we 
 have our own outdoor swimming pool.   
                                       
 There is also a youth club and snooker
 club but both of these are also in    
 Donington.                            
                                       
 It is a rural area and it is up to us 
 to find things to do.
