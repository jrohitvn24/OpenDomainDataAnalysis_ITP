		<content> A group from our class visited the    
 clothing section of  Symingtons,a     
 local firm who make garments such as  
{corsets, swim-wear, anoraks and       
{lingerie.}Symingtons employ 200       
 people, 70 work in the office and 130 
 cut the material. There are other     
 branches at Rugby, Whittlesey and     
 Peterborough. The various jobs include
 designing,and office work. Most are   
 employed on the machinery. Their      
 products are supplied to major stores.
 "MOTHERCARE"is the main store that    
 they send them too. People come to    
 order from as far afield as London,   
 Liverpool, Manchester and Tammworth.  
 Most of the lorries don't belong to   
{Symingtons.}They belong to the shops, 
 to take their orders, because         
{SYMINGTONS}only have 2 of their own.
