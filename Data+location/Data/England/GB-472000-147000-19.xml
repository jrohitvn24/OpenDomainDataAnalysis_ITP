		<content> THE LIFE STYLES OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE 
 CAN BE DESCRIBED AS 'LEISURELY'.      
 NEARLY ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR BLOCK,
 EXCEPT FOR THE VERY OLD, ARE PEOPLE   
 WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE IN THE AREA   
 BECAUSE THEY WORK NEARBY OR BECAUSE   
 THEY LIKE THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE       
 ENJOYMENT OF A QUIET, SLOW PACED RURAL
 LIFE STYLE IS A REASON THAT MANY      
 PARENTS GAVE WHEN WE ASKED THEM WHY   
 THEY CHOSE TO LIVE HERE.  MANY        
 FATHERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WORK  
 IN LONDON SAID THAT BEING ABLE TO     
 WORK IN THE GARDEN, WALK IN THE       
 COUNTRYSIDE  AND GET AWAY FROM THE    
 NOISE AND BUSTLE OF CITY LIFE WERE    
 IMPORTANT REASONS FOR THEIR CHOICE OF 
 RESIDENCE.  HOWEVER, MANY OF US       
 CHILDREN SAID THAT WE WOULD PREFER TO 
 LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE WERE MORE 
 THINGS TO DO.                         
                                       </content>
