		<title>09The Flashes</title>
		<content>  In our square there are some{Flashes.
 When we went to have a look we saw    
 some birds, Lapwing, Heron, Sandpiper,
 Shelducks and Swans.                  
   We saw a Sandmartin fly into a      
 bush,probably a nesting site.There was
 a lot of crops and there's a railway  
 track that runs through.Subsidence is 
 caused when the brine is pumped out   
 from under the ground.It causes sand  
 and clay to sink in.That's how a{Flash
 is formed.The flashes were called     
 Sandbach Flashes,Elton Hall and       
 Railway Flashes nature reserve.       
 Cheshire Conservation look after      
 them.                                 
   The birds are attracted to the{     
{Flashes}by marshy ground and shallow  
 water for feeding.There are plenty of 
 small streams and rivers.There are    
 some pipes which could be used for    
 nesting in and a bird reserve.        </content>
