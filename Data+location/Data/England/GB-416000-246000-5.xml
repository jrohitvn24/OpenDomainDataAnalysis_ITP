		<title>05ACCOMMODATION:      QUINTON</title>
		<content>   The villages of Upper and Lower     
 Quinton each comprise mixtures of     
 types of house,{mainly council and    
{army owned.                           
   One private and one council home    
 cater specially for the{elderly.      
   There is some new{development}in and
 around the village. There are new,    
{detached}houses in the older parts,   
 near the church, and also further up  
 the slopes of Meon Hill.              
   There are a number of{modernisations
 of period properties in both parts of 
 the village. For many, the view of    
 Meon Hill is a bonus.                 
   The army also has recently been     
 modernising quarters. This is         
 especially important in view of the   
 absence of a mains gas supply to the  
 village.Many have to use oil and      
 electricity to heat, so{energy        
{conservation}is of major importance.  </content>
