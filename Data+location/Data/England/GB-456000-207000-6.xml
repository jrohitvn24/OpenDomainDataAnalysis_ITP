class were sent home and did not return
to school until the following Wednesday
When they did return they had their    
classroom in the hall.Because of the   
disaster the Christmas concert was     
cancelled and each class had their own 
concert in their own class room.Luckily
the fire was in a separate classroom so
it did not spread and damage other     
parts of the school.But a fire was     
attemted in the headmasters office.Here
a window was broken,spirit was poured  
on the desk and they threw in a        
match.But the match did not light.Three
months later the damaged classroom was 
fully repaired and painted.The children
invited each class to see the new
