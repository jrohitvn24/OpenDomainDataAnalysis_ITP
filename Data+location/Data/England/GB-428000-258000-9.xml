		<title>09Heathcote Farm</title>
		<content>  Heathcote farm lies to the south of  
 Wasperton lane and consists of 630    
 acres. 400 acres of this is devoted to
 the corn crops of wheat, oats and     
 barley, while the rest is given over  
 to permanent pasture and hay and      
 silage fields. On the pasture are kept
 600 breeding sheep and 300 beef       
 cattle. These are sent to market      
 throughout the year,the majority going
 to Banbury market although some go to 
 Stratford. The corn is marketed       
 through corn merchants although a     
 great deal usually finds its way to   
 Barford mill where it is converted    
 into animal feed.The farm also raises 
 small flocks of turkeys and geese.    
  The farm employs 3 people the farmer 
 and his son and a farm worker who     
 lives in a cottage on the farm. Casual
 labour is employed at harvest and     
 lambing and calving times.            </content>
