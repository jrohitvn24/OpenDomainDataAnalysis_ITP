My name is Jennifer Lee and I am eight 
years old. On Monday morning my mum got
me up at half past seven. She got me   
some cereal for breakfast and then I   
cleaned my teeth and got changed. Then 
I walked up to school and said goodbye 
to mum. Just after I got in the bell   
rang for us to start lessons. First I  
read when I got into class and then I  
did some handwriting and then I gave   
in my savings money. After that it was 
time for assembly and after that it was
spellings. We did some writing as well.
After that it was dinner. We had fish  
cakes,chips and baked beans for dinner.
After dinner we had playtime and then  
we went swimming before we went home.  
After school I went to the dentist and 
had my tea. After tea I did a jigsaw   
puzzle,watched the television and went 
to bed at half past nine.              </content>
