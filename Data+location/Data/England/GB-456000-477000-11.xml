		<content>{ St.Hilda's}(Anglican) has a Norman   
 font and much 13 Century carving. The 
 parish registers go back to 1690. The 
 Churchyard has several interesting    
 gravestones: one made from an old mill
 grindstone. There is also the stump of
 a Saxon Cross. A stained glass window 
 commemorates Dick Thompson's          
 Grandparents (Village builders for 300
 years). The faces are taken from      
 photographs of the couple. The        
 resident vicar also serves Oswaldkirk 
 and from 1985 Gilling too.            
{ St.Benedict's}(Catholic). Much of the
 furnishing is the work of the Mouseman
 Robert Thompson of Kilburn. His first 
 commission was for an oak cross for   
 the war memorial. A monk from         
 Ampleforth Abbey serves the Parish.   
{ Methodists.}There is now only one    
 Chapel in use; a second having been   
 recently sold.                        </content>
