 THE VILLAGE. IT IS AN ADAPTED ARMY HUT
 WHICH HAS BEEN ENLARGED AND MUCH      
 IMPROVED AND IS USED BY MOST ORGANISA-
 TIONS AT SOME TIME BUT ALSO BY OUTSIDE
 GROUPS AND FOR PRIVATE FUNCTIONS LIKE 
 WEDDING RECEPTIONS. IT CAN BE DIVIDED 
 AND LET IN TWO OR THREE UNITS AND HAS 
 EXCELLENT FACILITIES. SERVING AS      
{THEATRE, CONCERT HALL, CLUBROOM, DISCO
{INDOOR SPORTS CENTRE AND MANY MORE,   
 IT SERVES BOTH LACEY GREEN AND LOOSLEY
 ROW AS A SOCIAL CENTRE. CUTLERY AND   
 CROCKERY CAN BE HIRED SO THAT CATERING
 IS EASY, THERE IS STAGING AND A PIANO 
 FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND AMPLE PARKING.  
 THE HALL IS RUN BY AN{ELECTED         
{COMMITTEE}WHICH ORGANISES MONEY       
 RAISING EVENTS TO COVER IMPROVEMENTS  
 AND MAINTENANCE. SOCIAL LIFE IN BOTH  
 VILLAGES WOULD BE POORER WITHOUT IT.
