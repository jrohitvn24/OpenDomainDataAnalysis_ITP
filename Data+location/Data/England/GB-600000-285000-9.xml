		<content> Being above sea level, most of this   
 block was free from fen, so it has    
 been inhabited for many thousands of  
 years.{Stone Age}flint impliments have
 been discovered in the fields,and in  
 the North West corner of the block is 
 a{Bronze Age}burial mound.            
 Kenninghall derived it's name from the
 fact that in this manor was a seat of 
 the ancient East Anglian kings,King's 
 Hall becoming Kenninghall.            
 Kenninghall was mentioned in the first
 Doomesday survey in 1068,and Quidenham
 church exhibits{Norman}features, the  
 round tower possibly dating from the  
 Anglo Saxon}times.                    
 In the{Middle Ages,}the area was      
 famous for sheep rearing,and was thus 
 prosperous,some of the ancient timber 
 framed houses still remaining.
