		<title>15LIFE STYLES:ASHLEWORTH</title>
		<content> The {Life Style}of the villages is    
 still influenced by rural background  
 and traditions;extremes of fashion and
{pop culture}are not usually seen      
 altho' most people can get to nearby  
 towns for discos and pubs.The village 
 inns are more used by families and the
 School,Village Hall, and Woodpecker's 
 Club provide meeting places for a     
 variety of activities which cater for,
 and possibly shape,the tastes of the  
 residents.Children's football and     
 cricket on the Green prepare for      
 village cricket at weekends,which is  
 still a focus for{family life.}Active 
 attendance at theatres and concerts is
 difficult,but the local radio station 
 keeps its' listeners informed and     
 complements  national{radio and       
{television,}which have a powerful     
 effect on a rural community somewhat  
 cut off from mainstream affairs.      </content>
