		<title>19The Domesday Project.</title>
		<content> Our Project started off with the class
 looking at a map in the classroom. Sir
 wrote off to the{Domesday Project}and 
 was given a twelve Kilometre area. The
 class had a meeting to discuss what   
 groups we should have. We had a{      
{Committee Meeting}with the parents.   
 The parents decided if they would like
 to take part in the{Project.}A form   
 went out telling about the groups and 
 which parents were in it and the      
 teachers and children. Each group held
 a meeting every week. The parents     
 would organize the next visit. We     
 visited a lot of places in our own    
 time as well as the school's time.    
 We decided to have an Exhibition to   
 raise some money for the{R.S.P.C.A.}  
 After a lot of{preparation}we are     
 placing the{data}on to{a floppy disk.
