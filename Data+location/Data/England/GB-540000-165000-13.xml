		<title>13BROMLEY FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content>   The club was founded in 1892. Their 
 nickname is the Lilywhites. They have 
 won the Amateur Cup three times, the  
 London Senior Cup three times, the    
 Kent Senior cup twice, the Kent       
 Amateur Cup twelve times, the Athenian
 League three times and the Isthmian   
 League four times.                    
   In the season 1923-4 Bromley won the
 Athenian League with 37 points. Three 
 Bromley players have won England caps:
 Eric Fright, Cyril Martin and Tommy   
 Hooper. I saw the 1982-3 team and they
 played well but lost 5-2. I also saw  
 the reserves play; they drew 1-1.     
 Bromley are in the Servowarm Isthmian 
 League and are seventh currently.     
   Bromley's current strip is Black,   
 White and Black.  About 500 peole     
 attend good matches. They usually play
 on Saturday afternoons and Tuesday    
 evenings.                             </content>
