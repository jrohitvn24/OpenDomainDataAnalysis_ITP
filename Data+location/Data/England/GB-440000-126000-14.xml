		<content> The Hursley Chimneys and Cottages     
 =================================     
  At the back of Merdon Manor there are
 three cottages , built in 1914 . They 
 are built of local chalk , mined at a 
 site on the Hursley Park Estate , near
 to the bronze-age hill-fort of Merdon 
 Castle . They are Grade Two Listed    
 Buildings because of some remarkable ,
 highly decorated , and very tall      
 chimneys , made out of brick . These  
 chimneys , totally out of place on the
 humble workers' cottages , are known  
 as the "Hursley Chimneys" . They are  
 unique to Hursley . The cottages are  
 covered with their original thatch ,  
 now 71 years old , but this is going  
 to be stripped late in 1985 , and     
 early in 1986 . The cottages belong to
 workers on Merdon Manor and the       
 Hursley Park Estate .
