		<title>17Religion in Alstonefield</title>
		<content>     There are Quakers living in       
Alstonefield.  Nuns come and stay with 
a woman about once a month.  The house 
they stay in is called The Hollow.     
Because the house is built down in a   
hollow, it has been named after it.    
     There are a lot of Christians in  
Alstonefield.  The vicar, Rev. Tinsley 
told us that there are about 250       
people living in Alstonefield.  There  
is a church service every Sunday with  
about 16 to 20 regular attenders, but  
about 100 people attend on special     
occasions.  In 1984 the church roof was
repaired and when the builder came to  
put up the scaffolding they had to     
pull up some boards and they found two 
whole skeletons.                       
     The places called Pea Low, Steep  
Low and Low Plantation are burial      
mounds.  There was an excavation at Pea
Low many years ago.                    </content>
