		<title>12Children's diet</title>
		<content>    We have been doing a survey on what
 children eat in our school.We can see 
 from our survey most children who have
 breakfast have cereal,few children    
 have no breakfast.Lots of children    
 have school dinners and very few have 
 sandwiches. Most children have a      
 cooked meal for tea.Most children's   
 favourite food is chips,very few      
 children's favourite is sandwiches.   
 Most children's favourite drink is    
 milk.Squash and apple juice are less  
 liked.                                
  This is what is in a typical         
 lunchbox:sandwiches,drink,crisps,     
 chocolate or an apple.A typical       
 school dinner might be chips,two      
 sausages and baked beans.For pudding  
 we have treacle sponge.We can see that
 more children eat things that are bad 
 for them,few children eat things that 
 are good for them.                    </content>
