		<title>18SHEEP DOG TRAINING</title>
		<content> Although this is often done as a      
 leisure activity,it is of great       
 importance to the sheep &amp; cattle      
 farmer.Generally the farmer trains his
 own dogs but occasionally,if there is 
 someone in the neighbourhood who is   
 particularly good at it,he might leave
 the early "running" of the dog to him.
 It is very important that the pup is  
 out of good working parents.Training  
 starts with general obedience,&amp; only  
 when this is mastered is the pup taken
 to the sheep.There are four basic     
 commands_LEFT,RIGHT,WALK ON &amp; STOP!   
 The well trained sheep dog is an      
 invaluable asset to the farmer who    
 would feel lost without him.
