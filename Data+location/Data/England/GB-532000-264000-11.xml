		<title>11CONINGTON - GAZETTEER</title>
		<content> Conington is a tiny village of 150    
 people situated some 15 kilometres    
 north-west of Cambridge. The village  
 is 2 kilometres south of the A604     
 trunk road. The small settlement is   
 sited on boulder clay some 15 metres  
 above sea level on the edge of the    
 Fens. The two main structures are the 
 Church and the Hall with the 45 houses
 in between. Amenities are few with    
 only one public house and one         
 telephone box. Like many surrounding  
 villages, the countryside is open,    
 arable land but the environs of the   
 village is wooded making it a pleasant
 place.
