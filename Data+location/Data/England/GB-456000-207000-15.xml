		<title>15BROWNIES IN SANDHILLS.</title>
		<content>The thing we like best about brownies  
was when we went on pack holidays to   
Hill End camp and Marlborough.We did   
things like treasure hunts and when a  
six found the treasure they shared it  
out.We did art and craft as well.Once  
we made a plasticine ship in a         
bottle.Each group had a different      
duty to do. They were waitreses,cooks  
and messengers.The cooks cooked        
breakfast,dinner and tea.We always had 
a three course meal,the waitrsses laid 
the table and cleard up afterwards.The 
messangers drew up a weather chart and 
brownies own which is saying prayers   
and always sang a song.  We always had 
a midnight feast.On the last night we  
did a play on whatever our theme       
was.When we wern't on pack holiday we  
do things like sponsered silences and  
lots of different sports as well.
