		<title>02THE STAFFORDSHIRE WAY</title>
		<content>    The Staffordshire Way is a long    
 distance footpath that will ultimately
 span the length of the County for 90  
 miles between Mow Cop and Kinver      
 Edge.The section from Rocester runs   
 along the Dove valley. The river bank 
 below Abbotsholme School has a wide   
 selection of Willows. The route passes
 into Derbyshire through water meadows,
 below the wooded escarpment that rises
 high on the left.The path goes to the 
 right of the trees which line a       
 drainage ditch, crossing a small brick
 bridge by some stunted Willows. Over  
 the bridge it joins a track up to a   
 field gate which leads into a lane    
 climbing to a farm.                   
 Red brick farmhouses are dotted along 
 the way, in particular, Eaton Hall    
 Farm, a predominantly 18 th Century   
 building, close to the top of the     
 escarpment.                           </content>
