		<title>07Richmond-A retrospect.</title>
		<content>   I have lived in Richmond since I was
 two weeks old.My family moved here    
 when my dad got a job with the North  
 Yorkshire Water Authority.I like      
 Richmond because it has many          
 interesting places like the castle,the
 Georgian Theatre,the Green Howards    
 Museum and the River Swale.The Friary 
 Gardens are near the Market           
 Square.They are beautiful with flower 
 beds in summer and are decorated with 
 lights and models of snowmen,animals  
 and Father Christmas and a crib with  
 Mary,Joseph and Jesus at Christmas.   
   Not far from my home is Ronaldshay  
 Park.On summer days we often go down  
 there and play on the roundabouts,    
 slide and the new wooden apparatus.   
 Unfortunately we are moving to a      
 village near York.It will take some   
 time to get used to it.Iwill miss     
 Richmond.I have enjoyed living here.JL</content>
