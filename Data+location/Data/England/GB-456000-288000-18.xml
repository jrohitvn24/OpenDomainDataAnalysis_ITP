		<content> Functions like the Harvest Supper,    
 Autumn Bazaar, auctions and the Annual
 Flower Show are well attended and the 
 proceeds help with the upkeep of the  
 village hall. The hall was purchased  
 from the church commissioners in l978 
 by the villagers who are responsible  
 for it upkeep.                        
                                       
 During the month of June a Garden Fete
 is held at Manor Farm.  This          
 incorporates a gymkhana, dog show,    
 sheep dog trials, and last year a     
 church flower festival, and many      
 traditional side shows.               
                                       
 The Women's Institute have this year  
 held a Valentine Supper, a sponsored  
 knit-in, and go carol singing every   
 year, all in aid of charity.
