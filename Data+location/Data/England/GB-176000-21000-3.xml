		<title>03THE OLD QUARRIES</title>

 Gabbro and Blue Elvan was quarried at 
 Porthoustock until 10 years ago.  It  
 was a source of employment for local  
 men. The ships came to load up at the 
 jetty which is now only used by       
 fishermen.  The conveyor brought the  
 stone to the jetty and loaded it onto 
 the ships.  The Gabbro was used for   
 roads, driveways, cement and          
 buildings. This quarry was known as   
 the 'West of England' quarry. Dean    
 Quarry still gets stone from the 'West
 of England' stockpile. Therefore some 
 machinery is still there but blasting 
 no longer takes place. St. Keverne    
 Quarry, now disused, was used         
 during the war for local aerodrome    
 building at Predannack.  This quarry  
 closed 25 years ago and is now        
 privately owned.
