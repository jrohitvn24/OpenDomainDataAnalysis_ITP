		<title>16Kettlethorpe Poultry Farming</title>
		<content> Commercially produced chickens provide
 jobs for thirty people in our area.Two
 managers oversee the fourteen sites,  
 each staffed by two men.Day old chicks
 are brought to the housing units,     
 each unit accomodating between        
 20,000/26,000 birds. For seven weeks  
 the chicks are fattened up, on starter
 crumb for ten days, then on starter   
 pellet,approximately eighteen tons per
 shed, and finally on grower for two   
 weeks. The chickens are then sent to  
 East Markham and Gainsborough poultry 
 factories where they are killed and   
 dressed for human consumption. As more
 chicken is eaten today than red meat  
 it is thought that output can only    
 increase. Animal Rights campaigners,  
 known as "Friends of the Earth",pose a
 threat to the producers as it would be
 possible for them to damage the empty 
 units during the changeover of birds. </content>
