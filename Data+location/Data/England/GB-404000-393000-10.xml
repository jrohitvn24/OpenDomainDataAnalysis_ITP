		<content>     { The Duke of Norfolk's School}is 
 one of the oldest schools in Glossop. 
 It is a small primary school divided  
 into two parts on different sites. The
{Infant School}is based at the original
 site in {Old Glossop.}There is a half 
 mile distance between the two sites.  
       The{Junior School}is at the{    
{Royle Annexe Site.}The children here  
 are between 6 to 11 years old. There  
 are 6 teachers and 180 children. This 
 is the newest part of the school      
 started in 1958 when it only consisted
 of the hall and kitchen. It has, of   
 course been added to since.           
       The children stay inside for    
 lunch and can either have a set meal  
 prepared by the school or can bring   
 sandwiches.
