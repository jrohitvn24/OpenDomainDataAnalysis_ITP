		<content>{Saturday,May 11th.}was the day of the 
{F.A.Challenge Trophy.Boston United v. 
{Wealdstone.All the coaches for 20miles
 around Boston were booked and a train 
 booked for the day.All the tickets    
 were sold,at least{10 000. Most       
 coaches stopped at{Baldock}and we saw}
 lots of people we knew.We arrived at  
{Wembley at 1430hrs}on a bright        
 afternoon.The stadium looked great    
 from a distance but disappointing when
 we got close.It was an exciting match 
 and Boston lost 2-1.We stopped at the 
 Comet,Hatfield and had a meal.It was a
 great day out.                        
 When we got home,about,2200hrs,we had 
 a drink.Then we were told about the   
 fire at{Bradford}and all the people   
 who were killed.It was a shock,so sad 
 and frightening.
