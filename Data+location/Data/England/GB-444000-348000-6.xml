		<title>06Annual carnival.</title>
		<content>    One of the main events in Brinsley 
 is the yearly carnival. The carnival  
 secretary,  Mrs Scothorne, came into  
 school to talk to us about her work   
 and involvement in making it run      
 smoothly. She has been the secretary  
 of the carnival for the last 8 years, 
 and this year Â£1000 was raised. Other 
 organisations hired stalls to raise   
 money for themselves. Â£500 is going to
 the Queen's Medical Centre Scanner    
 Appeal and Â£500 for amenities in      
 Brinsley.                             
     The carnival first began in the   
 1900's and marching bands from local  
 collieries took part. The present     
 committee has been going since Silver 
 Jubilee year in 1977. The committee   
 consists of 8 women and 7 men. Mrs    
 Scothorne sends many letters to       
 bands,police,council and sponsors.    
 Firework displays are also organized. </content>
