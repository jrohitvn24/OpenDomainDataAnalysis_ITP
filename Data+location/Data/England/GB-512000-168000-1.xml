   The area about to be described is an
 extremely varied and interesting one. 
 The 12 square kilometres include every
 style of housing from{Victorian and   
{Edwardian terraces}to{semi-detached   
 and{detached houses}of the twenties   
 and thirties and from small and modest
 council owned accommodation to large  
 and expensive private houses          
 overlooking the River Thames or Bushy 
 Park.                                 
   Although essentially a{residential  
{area}there is a little industry, a    
 great deal of{recreational open space 
 and several areas of special interest.
 The{River Thames}flows through the    
 area from west to east.               
   Among the areas of special interest 
 are{Hampton Court Palace, Bushy Park, 
{Hampton Water Works}and of course the 
{River Thames.                         </content>
