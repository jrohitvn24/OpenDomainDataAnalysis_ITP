		<title>13Industrial work of the area</title>
		<content> The main industry in the area is      
 gypsum processing.Gypsum is no longer 
 extracted here,in one case because of 
 being 'worked out' and in the other   
 because it was uneconomic.There is    
 however still one plant which         
 processes gypsum,extracted from       
 outside the area.This is prepared for 
 base products in cosmetics etc.Much is
 also prepared for building work in the
 powdered form and also made into      
 plasterboard for lining walls.More    
 rural industry is carried out at      
 Thoroton where there is extensive egg 
 production,these being mechanically   
 sorted,sized and packed for selling.  
 At Shelton and Alverton there are     
 horticultural concerns in 1 case for  
 raising coniferous trees and in the   
 other for growing of shrubs for sale. 
 At Flawborough a consumer research    
 firm tests food and drink for humans. </content>
