		<content> The original hospital was a sanatorium
 for the tuberculosis patients for whom
 the Settlement (see page 2) was       
 developed. In the 1950s when TB was   
 virtually eliminated the hospital     
 ceased to be a sanatorium and was     
 taken over by the National Health     
 Service.                              
                                       
 The Village Settlement devoted its    
 energies to the handicapped and the   
 hospital expanded and specialised.    
 Today it is a world leader in the     
 field of cardiac treatment, especially
 heart transplants. Although the       
 hospital does treat other conditions, 
 including chest problems and cancer,  
 it does not have a casualty unit, and 
 outpatient care is restricted to its  
 special areas.
