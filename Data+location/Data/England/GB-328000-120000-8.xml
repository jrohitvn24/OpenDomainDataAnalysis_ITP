		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content>   I get up in the morning at 07.00    
 and have cereal with sugar and milk   
 for breakfast . Then I pack my bag for
 school. I catch the school bus, which 
 comes every day when school is on;that
 is from Monday to Friday for about 36 
 weeks of the year. At school, I have  
 assembly at 08.55 when school starts. 
 After assembly I usually do Maths or  
 English and read. Then I have playtime
 from 10.40 until 10.55. After this I  
 do Maths if I haven't done it yet or  
 English. Then I write a story until   
 dinner. After that I have another play
 at approximately 12.35 which ends at  
 13.00. When I go back into the        
 classroom I  either do a Personal     
 Project or sometimes I go up to the   
 playing field.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
