		<content> Harlow's Town Centre is a pedestrian  
 shopping area with the main shops to  
 be found in Broad Walk.Until recently 
 there were 163 shops in the Town      
 Centre but in 1981 these were         
 supplemented by the development of the
 Harvey Centre.This centre is          
 completely under cover and is         
 climatically controlled.The shops are 
 on two levels joined by staircases and
 an escalator.There is an attractive   
 seating area with a fountain,a        
 sculpture and display area close by.  
 People come here to relax or to meet  
 their friends.Our survey showed that  
 the largest and one of the most       
 popular shops,is Tesco,whilst the     
 smallest,an electrical shop,had only 9
 sq.feet of floor space.Most of the    
 shops were built by the Corporation   
 and are leased to the shopkeepers.    
 There are spaces for 3800 cars.       </content>
