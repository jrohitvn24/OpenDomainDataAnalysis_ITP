		<title>07The Village Hall</title>
		<content> Our village hall celebrated its 50th  
 birthday this summer. Officially known
 as the Mary Clowes Hall, after its    
 donor,a member of a wellknown local   
 family. To mark the jubilee various   
 special events took place ending with 
 a grand village fair. The weather     
 proved unkind but despite this a great
 time was had by young and not so      
 young. Fancy dress competitions, funny
 hockey game were just two of the      
 events villagers took part in.  The   
 hall is used by many different groups 
 throughout the year. A flourishing    
 Playgroup, Yoyng Farmers, Women's     
 Institute, A very  popular Youth Club 
 and various different adult education 
 classes. The hall is also used for    
 discos dances and private parties.
