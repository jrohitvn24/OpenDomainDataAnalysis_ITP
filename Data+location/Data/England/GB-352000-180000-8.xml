		<content> The Severnside area is controlled     
 by Bristol City Council together with 
 Northavon District Council and        
 Almondsbury Parish Council. They are  
 responsible for planning and highways,
 footpaths, burial board, snow wardens 
 and liaison between local industry and
 Councils. I.C.I. is responsible for   
 the Severn Embankment in this area.   
 HOUSING                               
 The greater part of this area is      
 farmland or industrial estates, with  
 no housing. Part of Hallen village    
 contains 10 council houses, 3         
 bungalows the old school circa l858   
 turned into a house, two caravan homes
 and a number of small farmhouses and  
 cottages. There has been no new       
 building in the area for some years.
