		<title>01An Introduction to our area</title>
		<content> This area of{Solihull}is rapidly      
 changing. New{housing}and{industry}are
 rapidly taking over the once-open     
 countryside.                          
 The{landscape}is fairly flat, with    
 many varieties of well established    
 trees, and builders are continuing to 
 plant new trees in the new housing    
 estates. The council have reclaimed   
 the old tip on Monkspath Road into new
 park land. There are a few farms where
 animals are grazed but not much       
 arable farming.                       
 New industrial estates have been      
 built,bringing many employers to the  
 area, but the character of the area is
 still largely residential.Houses range
 from pre-war to modern estates still  
 under construction. A new school,     
 shops and a clinic are planned to     
 cater for these.
