 Preston Board school opened its doors 
 on 14th January 1878 with 17 girls and
 19 boys.  The Rev E Evers conducted   
 prayers and then declared the school  
 open.                                 
 The first head was Mr A J Watkinson.  
 He remained as head of the school for 
 42 years, retiring in 1920.  During   
 his years as head Mr Watkinson was    
 responsible for the education of 2177 
 children.                             
 Many children then as now took time   
 away from school for reasons not      
 strictly legitimate - fruit and potato
 picking were favourite reasons for    
 absence.  Other heads, W G Bartlett,  
 H R Skinner and H Verity left their   
 mark on the old Board School          
 transforming it into a modern day     
 primay school in modern classrooms.   </content>
