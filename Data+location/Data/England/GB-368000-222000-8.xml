		<title>08SOCIAL LIFE IN RURAL AREAS</title>
		<content>   Because of the very isolated nature 
 of the area the social life plays a   
 very important part in uniting the    
 villagers. Whilst fund-raising is the 
 aim of most events they are never-the-
 less well supported.                  
   Both villages have their share of   
 socials, jumble sales, auctions, wine 
 and cheese parties and whist drives.  
{  Harvest Suppers}are an annual event.
 Country dancing, Garden Parties and   
 Barbecues are  all popular summer     
 occasions.                            
   At the Stocking's Field in Aston    
 Ingham the{Scouts}hold an annual{"It's
{a Knockout"}and there  is a combined  
{Church Fete and President's XI Cricket
{Match.}This has replaced the old      
 August IIth celebrations commemerating
 the rebuilding of the Church and held 
 at the Rectory.
