		<content> A group of Telford schoolchildren set 
 out to find some local footpaths      
 recently _ and found that most of them
 had disappeared.                      
 The children from Orleton Park School,
 Wellington,had been given the area of 
 Great Bolas and Eaton Upon Tern to    
 study as part of their work for the   
 BBC's Domesday Project.               
 But when they tried to follow the many
 footpaths marked on the map some of   
 them got lost because paths were no   
 longer there.                         
 "We found out that most of the        
 footpaths in the area had either been 
 blocked or had been ploughed up.That  
 annoyed us a bit because our group    
 thought we had taken the wronge       
 turning,"said Helen Scholey.          
 The children are writing down         
 everything they can find about the    
 Doomsday Project.1                    </content>
