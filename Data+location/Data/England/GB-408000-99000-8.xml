   The 'bushes' helped Sinbad make a   
 raft out of palm trees, tied together 
 with vines. Finally the raft was      
 completed.                            
   Four natives carried the raft out of
 the dark, dank hut down the precipi-  
 tous rock face. Sinbad set sail for   
 wherever his raft would take him. When
 he was out of sight of the natives, he
 lay down and slept, the gentle rock of
 the boat making him doze off.

{MY PET DRAGON}(Part 1) by Marcus Iddon
   One day I was walking to school when
 I heard a scuttling noise in the      
 bushes. I looked in the bushes and saw
 a little green dragon with ruby-like  
 eyes. Its skin was like velvet. Its   
 nose was like one great emerald. That 
 evening I sat in my bed dreaming about
 the dragon I had seen that day.       </content>
