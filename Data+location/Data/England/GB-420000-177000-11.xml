		<content>{LIDDINGTON HILL _}A univallate iron   
 age hill fort of 7.5 acres, 910 ft.   
 above sea level.  It is 4.5 miles from
 Swindon, 7.5 miles from Marlborough.  
 At its summit is a concrete           
 observation box with steps leading    
 into a chamber.  This is one of a     
 chain of observation posts built      
 during the Second World War.          
 Liddington Hill is not a public       
 monument.  Constant erosion by cattle 
 grazing on the hill is causing some   
 concern as the structure of the hill  
 is slowly being reduced.              
{THE MANOR _ UPPER UPHAM _}Built in the
 16th century by the Goddard Family of 
 Upham on the site of an earlier       
 building, said to be the hunting lodge
 of{John of Gaunt}who came to the area 
 to hunt the Aldbourne Chase.  It is a 
 house of flint and stone with         
 mullioned windows and 2 storey porch. </content>
