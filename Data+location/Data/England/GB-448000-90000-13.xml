		<content> Solent Self Drive Car Hire comprises a
 fleet of ten cars which operate from a
 site at Pallance Gate on the edge of  
 Parkhurst Forest.All the cars are     
 Fords as these are considered to be   
 the most reliable and familiar to the 
 customers. Customers contact Solent   
 Car Hire by phone and arrange to be   
 met with a car. The cars are hired out
 for periods of one day or more. The   
 customers are business people on the  
 island or business people and         
 holidaymakers from the mainland or    
 abroad. Some people hire a car because
 their own is off the road.The company 
 has been operating for five years and 
 is kept very busy.
