		<content> On 28th June the juniors went to the  
 Farne Islands. While we were on the   
 boat it started to rain. We saw       
 prffins, razorbills, shags and lots   
 more. When we got back in the bus we  
 went ot the shops after our dinners.  
 The infants went to Stewart Park on   
 21st June. It was raining when we set 
 off. We went to see the animals. There
 was a peacock. It spread its feathers 
 out. Next we went to the plant house  
 and saw all the different plants, then
 we went back for out picnic. After    
 that we played football. We went ot   
 the shop and bought something. We all 
 went upstairs and got an ice-cream. On

 London. They stayed at the Norfolk    
 Towers Hotel and went ot Wembley to   
 see the schoolboy International. We   
 went to London Zoo and Greenwich Park.
