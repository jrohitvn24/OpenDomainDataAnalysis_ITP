		<title>05 Village School in Wilby</title>
		<content> The village school is over 150 years  
old &amp; stands next to the church in the 
centre of the village. Although the    
building is very old the three class-  
rooms are bright and attractively      
decorated with displays of children's  
work. { Last year the school was       
modernised and given indoor toilets,a  
new cloakroom &amp; a small library.} It   
does not yet have a school hall,but the
pupils have games lessons in a nearby  
playing field.                         
 There are about 60 pupils in the      
school, aged between 7 &amp; 11. They are  
divided into 3 classes- infants(aged   
4-7),lower juniors (8-9) and upper     
juniors (10-11). They have religious   
services three times a week in the     
church. They enjoy country dancing,    
science,physical education and maths.  
The school does not have all the       
facilities of the large town schools.  </content>
