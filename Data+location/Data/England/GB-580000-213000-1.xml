		<title>01WITHAM, THE TOWN</title>
		<content> WITHAM is a small town lying between  
 Chelmsford and Colchester on the A12. 
  The original Town was in the         
 Saxon Burgh containing St. Nicolas'   
 church ( The Victorian Railway        
 builders cut through this in 1842).   
  Evidence has been found on the south 
 east side of a Roman Temple(Witham    
 Lodge Estate) and a Romano British    
 village.                              
  The main street, Newland Street has  
 its origins in the lands given to the 
 Knights Templar.                      
  Many buildings have Georgian Fronts  
 resulting from the discovery of a     
 Mineral spring by Dr. Taverner in     
 17.C.It also developed some importance
 as a staging postfor the coaches      
 travelling to the East Coast.         
  In 1965 the town became a London     
 Overspill town, offering new homes for
 people from London.                   </content>
