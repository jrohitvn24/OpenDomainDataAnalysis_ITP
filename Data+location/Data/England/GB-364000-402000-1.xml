		<content>     DURING THE{CIVIL WAR,}A BATTLE WAS
 FOUGHT ON THE SITE OF THE{CHOWBENT    
{CHAPEL. }THE TOWN WAS KNOWN AS        
 CHOWBENT UNTIL THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY 
 WHEN IT ADOPTED THE NAME OF{ATHERTON. 
 EVEN TODAY, SPECIAL PERMISSION IS     
 REQUIRED TO USE THE NAME{'CHOWBENT'.  
     THIS WAS FORMERLY A{MINING AND    
{COTTON}AREA WHICH, OVER THE PAST FEW  
 YEARS HAS DECLINED.  NOWADAYS IT IS A 
 DORMITORY TOWN IN WHICH THE PEOPLE    
 TRAVEL TO{MANCHESTER}AND OTHER CENTRES
 FOR WORK.                             
     NEVERTHELESS, THE PEOPLE HAVE     
 RETAINED THEIR{ATHERTON}IDENTITY,     
 MAINLY BECAUSE IN THE PAST, IT WAS A  
 CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITY, RELYING TOTALLY 
 ON LOCAL EMPLOYMENT AND WAS SEPARATED 
 FROM THE MAIN CONURBATION OF          
{MANCHESTER}BY A GREEN BELT.           
     THE FOLLOWING PAGES DETAIL SOME OF
 THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THE AREA.  </content>
