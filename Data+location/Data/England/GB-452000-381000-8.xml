		<content> The man at the{quarry}said it got its 
 name because there was an old coal    
 mine near by and it is not used any   
 more so they gave the name to the     
 quarry.It was opened 8 years ago in   
{1977.}The stone they quarry is called 
 dolametic{lime stone}from the         
 carboniferous age.The stone is used   
 for building roads and houses and is  
 also used for concrete and draining.At
 the moment they quarry 200,000 to     
 300,000 tons of stone every day       
 because they are building the{Worksop 
{bypass.}The quarry is 300 yards long  
 by 250 yards wide and 30 feet         
 deep.Four to five men work there when 
 they are producing stone but if they  
 are not producing stone only two men  
 work there.
