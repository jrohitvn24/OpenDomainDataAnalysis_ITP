 There is a{Youth Club}that meets in   
 the Church Hall (village hall).  It   
 arose out of the requests from        
 youngsters in the village (Tredington)
 to meet in the hall, rather than      
 organised by adults.  There are no    
 adult Youth Leaders, but parents in   
 turn keep an eye on its progress etc. 
 The Youth Club is only a very small   
 group.  The only womens' organisation 
 between the two villages is the       
{Women's Institute.} There is also a   
 small{prayer group/study group}which  
 meets together every month in a       
 different persons home.
