		<title>13Tulip Time.</title>
		<content>      Every year, as May comes around  
 the annual tulip time activity gets   
 under way.  Spalding boasts a carnival
 parade, but all the little churches   
 have their own displays.              
      Up goes the green canvas tent    
 beside the church door.  Local ladies 
 join the rota to man the stall.  There
 are cakes and teas, little plants in  
 pots, and while the visitors gaze at  
 flower arrangements in the church, the
 kettle boils again to slake the next  
 ones thirst.                          
      Parade day itself, the traffic   
 queues creep by and many a traveller  
 leaves the line for sustenance. Church
 funds benefit and the vicar beams.    
      People climb the tower and look  
 at flowers in the distance.  They go  
 home, happy, for another year.        
      Flowers fade, leaves wither away 
 leaving bulbs for summer harvest.     </content>
