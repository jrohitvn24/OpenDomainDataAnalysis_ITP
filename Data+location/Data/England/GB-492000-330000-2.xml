		<content> ]History of:                          
   The Great North Road has been an    
 important road since the Sixteenth    
 century.At this time horse drawn      
 wagons,stage_coaches and people on    
 foot,used this route.Travelling any   
 distance was time consuming and       
 involved many stops.Consequently      
 there were many inns,and staging      
 points along this road.Towns grew up  
 around these points (e.g.Grantham.)   
   Legend has it that Dick Turpin used 
 this road to rob stage_coaches,and    
 probably used it for his marathon ride
 from London to York in 48 hours.      
   The road has grown from a narrow    
 lane to a four lane cariageway this   
 century.By_passes were built aound the
 main towns (@1960 ) to stop traffic   
 congestion.Some parts of the A1 are   
 now motorway(Stevenage to london).
