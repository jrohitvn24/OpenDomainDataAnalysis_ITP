		<title>15POSTAL SERVICE</title>
		<content> The Postal service in the district is 
 typical of that to be found in rural  
 communities.  Many people live in     
 farmhouses which are some distance    
 from the main highways so that it is  
 common practice for the postman to    
 make his delivery to some central     
 location from which the mail may be   
 collected.  The local, village shop   
 often serves this purpose as does the 
 school.  In fact, the delivering      
 postman will even collect letters to  
 be posted if they are left fixed in   
 the letter box of the school ready for
 him.                                  
   Some of the post boxes also are     
 reminders of times gone by.  The      
 collection box in Shirwell Town still 
 bears the insignia 'V.R.' and others  
 in the district display 'G.R'.
