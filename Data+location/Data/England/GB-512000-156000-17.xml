   Of the people interviewed, one      
 remembered the pound, a stables next  
 to the blacksmiths and the Cock Inn.  
 Only one person had a car _ he also   
 had a chauffeur. The squire lived in  
 Badingham House and the Parson and his
 wife ran the school (St. Mary's       
 School).                              
    One person remembered seeing Silent
 Films in Leatherhead. On Empire Day   
 every child in the school received 1/_
 from a large landowner who worked for 
 the bank of England. One man earned   
 three pounds a week in his first job. 
 A woman earned only one pound five    
 shillings. A lady teacher earned nine 
 pounds a month.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
