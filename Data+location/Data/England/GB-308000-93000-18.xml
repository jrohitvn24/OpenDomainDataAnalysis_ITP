		<content> Some children interviewed elderly     
 people to learn about the changes that
 have taken place in the last 50 to 60 
 years. Previously there were three    
 schools, an Infant school in Jesu     
 Street which is now the Play          
 school, a Boys school in Yonder Street
 and the Girls school in Sandhill      
 Street. Children started school at 3  
 or 4 years of age,moved to the Boys or
 Girls school at 7 and left there at 13
 or 14. A few children, if they passed 
 an examination or if their parents    
 paid for them, went to the Kings      
 School which was at the Priory before 
 it moved to its present site in 1928. 
 All the teachers were very stict and  
 often punished the children with the  
 cane or slipper. Today it is very rare
 for a child to be caned or smacked.
