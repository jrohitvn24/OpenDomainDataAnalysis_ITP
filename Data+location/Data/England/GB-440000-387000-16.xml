		<title>16THE ELECTRONIC AGE?</title>
		<content>    We gathered our information from   
{local shopkeepers}and{workers in      
{larger companies.}It seems as time    
 goes by that more{electronic devices} 
 are being used in everyday life.      
   {Electronic cash registers}were     
 introduced circa{1975}and are used in{
{14}out of{23 shops}questioned. Other  
 devices such as{electronic scales,    
{burglar alarms and security monitors} 
 are not as common.                    
    Only{5}out of{27}businesses use{   
{computers}at present. They are used   
 mainly in{accounting and stock control
 but also for{controlling machinery,   
{storing information and invoicing.}The
 result is{cheaper and accurate}work at
 the expense of{jobs.}Some manual jobs 
 like{book-keeping}cannot be replaced. 
    Most{new technology}has been       
 introduced in larger businesses where 
 they can afford to expand.            </content>
