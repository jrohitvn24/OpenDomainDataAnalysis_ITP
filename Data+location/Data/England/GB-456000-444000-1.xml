		<content> Our area is largely an agricultural   
 one with the river Ouse and the city  
 of York close by. It is divided into  
 three main villages,Copmanthorpe,     
 Acaster Malbis being west of the river
 and Naburn east of the river. As we   
 are very close to the city of York,the
 inhabitants of the area rely for their
 shopping and entertainment on the     
 city. We are affected only marginally 
 by the tourists visiting the          
 city,their presence is noticed mainly 
 by a number of caraban sites in the   
 area and the busy traffic on the A64  
 motorway.All three villages particu_  
 larly Copmanthorpe,have seen alot of  
 new housing over the last ten years   
 consisting of mainly new estates.     
 Despite this there is a lively        
 community spirit still to be felt in  
 all three villages.
