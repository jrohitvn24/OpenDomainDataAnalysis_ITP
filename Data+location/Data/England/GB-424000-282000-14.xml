		<content> All the work on this area for the     
 Domesday Project was undertaken by    
 Staff and Children from Meriden       
 Primary School in the Summer of 1985. 
                                       
 The children from Classes 3 and 4 all 
 worked on the Project and helped to   
 produce this work.                    
                                       
 The school is a small village Primary 
 School with approximately 100 pupils  
 whose ages range from 5 to 11. We are 
 all very proud of our school and our  
 area and would always be pleased to   
 welcome any visitors who may refer to 
 these pages in the future.
