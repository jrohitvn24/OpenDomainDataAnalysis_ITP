{4> What types of fish are caught and  
{when are they caught?                 
 On the Tay we fish for salmon between 
 15th January and 15th October. The    
 brown trout season lasts from 15th    
 March until the 6th October.          
{5> Describe your favourite fish,      
{tackle, bait and stretch of the river.
 My favourite fishing is fly fishing   
 for trout. Having said that my        
 clearest memory is of catching salmon 
 particularly big salmon. I have never 
 really felt that one beat on the upper
 Tay is any better than another        
 although that is not true of the lower
 Tay.
