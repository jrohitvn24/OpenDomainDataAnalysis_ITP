		<title>03THE FARM CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Today the farm consists of 130 acres  
 given over to grass, barley, potatoes 
 and turnips. The farmer, Mr B. Steel, 
 had an unusual adventure in July 1976 
 when he shot a lioness which escaped  
 from a nearby site where a circus     
 over-wintered.                        
                                       
{CHAPEL FARM}                          
 Chapel Farm is unusal, because there  
 is a Chapel in part of the farm       
 buildings. A service is held there on 
 the first and third sunday of each    
 month. The Chapel has been there for  
 about 120 years. Before that, Church  
 services were held in the local       
 farmhouses on a rota basis.In the     
 chapel, the Altar brasses came from   
 the church at Langsett, the Altar     
 covers from Midhope church, and the   
 seat covers from Penistone Church.
