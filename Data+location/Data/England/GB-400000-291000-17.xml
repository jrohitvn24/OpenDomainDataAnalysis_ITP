		<title>17School Day West Bromwich</title>
		<content> I catch the bus at 8.40am and arrive  
 at school about 8.45 and then walk    
 around until the bell goes for        
 registration at 9.0am. After Assembly 
 at 9.30, the bell goes for first      
 lesson which for me is Spanish. The   
 bell goes for second lesson at 10.10  
 which is maths. After maths is break  
 which is fifteen minutes long. I talk 
 to my friends and eat crisps. Third   
 and fourth lesson is PE and we usually
 have tennis, athletics or rounders. At
 12.15 pm we go back to the gym for a  
 shower and get changed.               
 At 12.25 I go home for dinner. I have 
 to catch a bus at 1.30pm so I will get
 to school for the afternoon           
 registration at 1.40. At 1.50 the     
 fifth lesson starts and I have treble 
 Technical Drawing. School finishes at 
 3.50pm but there is homework to do.
