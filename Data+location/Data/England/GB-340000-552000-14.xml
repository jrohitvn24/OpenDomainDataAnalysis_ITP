		<title>14GIRLS PLAYGROUND GAMES.</title>
		<content>    Lesley and I have chosen 2 games   
 that girls play in the playground.   {
{  POISON FINGERS, MINIMUM 4 PLAYERS.} 
  One person is"man"and the rest of the
 players hold her fingers.She calls a  
 players name and that player has to   
 evade the catcher.If caught the player
 puts her hands on the wall she can be 
 freed by somebody,who has yet to be   
 caught, running under her arms.       
{  MAY WE CROSS YOUR GOLDEN RIVER.     
{         MINIMUM 3 PLAYERS. }         
  One person is"man"the others say "May
 we cross your golden river to fetch   
 our father's Christmas dinner?"The    
 person that is"man"chooses one aspect 
 only to allow you to cross. e.g. those
 wearing red or those with hats on .If 
 you have that attribute you try and   
 get by the"man" but if they catch     
 you,you are"man".
