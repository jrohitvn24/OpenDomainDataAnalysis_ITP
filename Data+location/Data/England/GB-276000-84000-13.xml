		<content> Most of the people who live in this   
 area do so because they love its      
 beauty,tranquility and peace.Some are 
 anti_tourism because they fear that   
 their surroundings will be spoilt by  
 the introduction of tourist facilities
 Others are glad for townspeople to be 
 able to share their good fortune in   
 living in such a beautiful area.      
   When the Water_board made more car_ 
 parks and opened up footpaths round   
 the nearby reservoirs the local resid 
 ents were worried that it would bring 
 too big an influx of visitors but     
 admit that this has not been the case.
   No_one to whom we spoke was at all  
 worried by the lack of water and      
 sewage mains.They all had adequate    
 private water supplies and sewage     
 disposal systems.
