		<content> We went to the Trout Farm at          
 Brockhollands,Mr Price the owner      
 showed us round.We saw some baby trout
 about 4cms long they were in the      
 hatching shed and were a month old.   
 Each fish lays 1000 eggs which stay in
 the hatching shed.The food for the    
 baby trout costs Â£500 per tonne.The   
 breeding fish lay 50,000 eggs yearly, 
 75% of these eggs survive and hatch,  
 but the baby fish are delicate and    
 will die if the water doesn't have air
 bubbled through it.The fish are       
 American Rainbow Trout.They are sold  
 as 8oz,12oz,1lb weight.Mr Price sells 
 a lot of fish to hotels.We were given 
 a fish,when we got back to school we  
 drew lots for it.Beth Haverly won it.
