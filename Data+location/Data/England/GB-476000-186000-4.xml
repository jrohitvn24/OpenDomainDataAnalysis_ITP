		<content>We have 65 Friesian cows and also some 
young calves,yearlings and heifers.When
a heifer has had its first calf,it     
becomes a cow and is milked with the   
rest of the herd twice a day.The new   
calf is fed on its mother's milk for 3 
to 4 days.It is then put onto the      
bucket,but,if it will not take milk    
from its mother,we use an old baby     
bottle with the hole in the teat       
enlarged.The bottle is then filled with
warm milk and the calf will,with a bit 
of coaxing,drink from the bottle.      
  All through the winter the calves are
fed on hay,straw,calf nuts and brewer's
grains.We feed this mixture to the     
calves until they are old enough to go 
out into the fields.This will usually  
happen from mid June to late July.If a 
cow has mastitis,the milk cannot be    
accepted into the large refrigerated   
bulk tank for fear of contamination.   </content>
