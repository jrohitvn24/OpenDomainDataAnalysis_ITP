		<content> In{1673}Nailstone had a master to     
 teach the children, he probably had   
 his school in the church.             
                                       
 In{1828}Earl Howe supported the       
 building of a village school. In{1832}
 it had 80 children. It was enlarged in
 1858.                                 
                                       
 In{1982}the new Dove Bank Primary     
 School was built for children from    
 Nailstone, Bagworth and Battram. It   
 was built partly from N.C.B. funding  
 following the effects of subsidence on
 former schools in Bagworth and        
 Battram.                              
                                       
 It has just over 100 children in{1985.
 Children enter school during the term 
 in which they will become five and    
 they transfer to Ibstock High School  
 in the summer after they become eleven</content>
