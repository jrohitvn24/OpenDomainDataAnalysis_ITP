 reservoirs, Sibley Back, which holds  
 650,000,000 gallons of water and the  
 new reservoir, Colliford, when it is  
 full,it will hold ten times that      
 amount.                               
   Water is released from the dam into 
 the river Fowey. Further down the     
 river the water is taken into the     
 Restormel Water Works, where  it is   
 purified and made fit for drinking.   
   From Restormel the clean water is   
 pumped to the underground storage     
 reservoir on the hill at Foxpark. This
 reservoir is a concrete box set in the
 hill which is 665ft above sea level.  
 Foxpark contains 5,000,000 gallons and
 provides water for Bodmin and the     
 surrounding villages.
