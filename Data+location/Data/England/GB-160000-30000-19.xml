		<content> Sithney Cornish Wrestling Club uses   
 Sithney C.P. School for winter        
 training and Chynhale Sports Club     
 field for summer practices and        
 tournaments.                          
 The sport of Cornish Wrestling has a  
 long and colourful history and Cornish
 wrestlers are recorded as having      
 entertained the Royal Court in Tudor  
 times on a number of occasions.       
 The Sithney Club is at the forefront  
 of a revival of interest in the sport 
 and the number of members has         
 increased in recent years.  Training  
 is offered to men and boys over the   
 age of eight.                         
 Contests take place within a sawdust  
 circle and wrestlers wear only shorts 
 and a hessian jacket which can be     
 seized by an opponent to assist in    
 making a throw.
