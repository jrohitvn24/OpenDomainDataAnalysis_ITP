		<content>     Of the 48 home closes that        
survived from Anglo-Saxon times until  
the enclosures of 1763 only 11 now     
remain.                                
     Possibly of 14th century cruck    
construction are Brook Farmhouse       
opposite the Methodist Chapel and      
Barrack Row in Smithfield End.         
     There are fine survivals of       
domestic architecture from the time of 
great rebuilding following the         
dissolution of the Priory of St Mary le
Pre near Dunstable and Woburn Abbey.   
     The Manor House (1560) and        
Deveral's Farmhouse (1632) are built of
the local Aylesbury limestone.Otherwise
the houses are generally of timber     
panel and red brick.The claypit at the 
south-western approach to the village  
supplied the clay which was often baked
on site.Brick boundary and frontage    
walls are a common feature.            </content>
