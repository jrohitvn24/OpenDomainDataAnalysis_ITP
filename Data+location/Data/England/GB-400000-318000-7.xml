		<content>THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH.                
Today we went to the Evangelical Church
which is near our school. The money to 
build it came from the people who went 
to the church. They paid 40,000 pounds 
for the church to be built. The people 
who take the services are men, women or
children. It sounds very surprising a  
child taking a service. They have three
services a week. They built it near the
shops because it is a central place    
where people pass and look. A man named
Mervin Bird designed the church. They  
have a prizegiving in July for the     
children.                              
THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.         
The first church at Etching Hill was   
built in Church Lane in 1890. In 1963  
they decided to build a larger church  
nearby. It was opened on Whitsunday    
1964 and there is a large congregation.
There is also a Sunday School.         </content>
