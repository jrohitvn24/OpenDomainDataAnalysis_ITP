		<title>04THE GAMEKEEPER</title>
		<content>{Mr.Knight }is now the only gamekeeper 
 employed on Mr.Buxton's land.His job  
 is to look after game and the pheasant
 chicks which he rears,from            
 foxes,weasels and stoats.The pheasants
 are bred for shooting by invited      
 guests.Beaters make a lot of noise    
 which frightens the birds into the air
 where they are shot.Mr. Knight's      
 labrador and spaniel are used to      
 retrieve the birds.He also has a      
 fierce rotweiler dog which is used to 
 frighten poachers who come in gangs to
 steal the pheasants.                  
      {Mr.Knight}catches rabbits which 
 destroy crops.Last yearover 2,000     
 rabbits were killed.Traps,snares and  
 ferrets are used to catch rabbits.    
      {Mr.Knight}has lived in the      
 country all his life.He enjoys his    
 work and says that each season of the 
 year brings new challenges.           </content>
