		<content> Gardening is the most popular pastime.
 Nearly all the gardens are beautifully
 kept. There are over 400 apple, 111   
 pear and 150 plum trees in the village
 alone. Swimming is the most popular   
 sport. Tennis, walking, football,     
  painting, sewing and reading are also
 popular pastimes, so are flower       
 arranging, darts and skittles.        
 Listening to music is enjoyed by many 
 people but few admitted to watching   
 television.                           
  Outside the village there is fox     
 hunting. The{Vale of the White Horse} 
 hunt hunts the area. There are regular
 pheasant shoots in season and a few   
 days beating for the shoot is one way 
 to pass the day and end up with a     
 brace of birds. Cycling has become a  
 much more common activity. There are  
 several sprightly septuagenarians and 
 older.                                </content>
