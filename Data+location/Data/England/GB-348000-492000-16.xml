		<title>16MUSIC IN KENDAL</title>
		<content>   Kendal is probably the most musical 
 town in the country for its size. Its 
 main feature is the{Mary Wakefield    
{Festival.}It first took place in 1885 
 and Mary Wakefield was the founder.   
 She was very musical as a child and   
 organised a{competition}for musical   
 people in Kendal and surrounding area.
   There are lots of musical groups in 
 Kendal mostly classical. These include
{Kendal Choral Society, Kendal South   
{Choir}and{Westmorland Orchestra.      
  Musical activity has grown in Kendal 
 and the Mary Wakefield is the oldest  
 festival in this area. The building of
 South Lakeland Leisure Centre has made
 music more popular, both for{classical
 and{pop concerts.}There are many pubs 
 in Kendal which have live bands. The  
 churches also have musical evenings   
 and have been connected with music for
 a long time.                          </content>
