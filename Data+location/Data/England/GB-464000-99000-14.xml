		<content>   PFC's ground,{Fratton Park,}which is
 in Frogmore Road, was bought as arable
 land in 1897. The main stand has stood
 there ever since. It held{46000}people
 in 1939, the year they won the FA Cup.
   The Pompey Chimes are famed through 
 -out the football world.              
   The violence in Brussels may have   
 put off supporters at some clubs but  
 not Portsmouth's{loyal fans}who come  
 for the excitement of the match. One  
 stand is reserved for children and    
 pensioners.                           
   The present manager, Alan Ball, is a
 former captain of England. Recently,  
 'Pompey' have gained much money from  
 the sale of international{Mark Hateley
 to AC Milan, but just missed promotion
 to{Division One.}Next year, it will be
 different!
