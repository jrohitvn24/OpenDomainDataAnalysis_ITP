		<title>17EMPLOYMENT IN FLECKNEY</title>
		<content> Fleckney has a variety of employment  
 in the village but many people commute
 each day as far afield as Northampton 
 and Nottingham. The shops can provide 
 for almost all the day to day needs of
 the village and they are staffed by66%
 of the villagers the rest coming in   
 from the other villages.The bulk of   
 the factories are sited on a small    
 industrial estate on the edge of the  
 village. A surprisingly low percentage
 of the workforce here are villagers   
 only 40%.The opening of 2 convenience 
 food shops(a fish and chip shop and a 
 takeaway Chinese)provide no extra work
 for the villagers.However the large   
 new Spar Supermarket has provided the 
 village with 11 jobs.
