		<content>   The text describes a rural area,    
 studied by Junior School Children. It 
 introduces the area and describes its 
 origins to help strangers to          
 understand its characteristics.       
   The Church was studied in detail.   
 Its earliest part is Saxon and it     
 contains rare wall paintings and a    
 superb 12th Century North Arcade.     
   The "hill" of magnesium limestone   
 supports botanical specimens of       
 interest.                             
   The surrounding farms and           
 local amenities are typical of a      
 country area.                         
   The final comments by local poeple  
 summarize the loyalty and affection   
 felt by the community towards their   
 enviroment in 1985.
