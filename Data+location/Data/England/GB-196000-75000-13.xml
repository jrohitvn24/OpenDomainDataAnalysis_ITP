		<content> Immediately south of St Minver village
 is the St Minver House Holiday Estate,
 an extensive holiday complex which is 
 the largest employer in the area. St  
 Minver House was originally the{      
{squire's manor house.}In{1965}the     
 estate was sold and then the house    
 became a hotel. During recent         
 years,under different ownership,the   
 estate has been developed as a        
 self_catering holiday camp open from  
{Easter to mid September}with many     
 recreational facilities. Most of the  
 sixteen hectare site,which includes   
 woodland, contains residential        
 caravans and 26 chalets. There is also
 a field for tents and touring         
 caravans. The complex when full,caters
 for about{1600 people.}Holidaymakers  
 from the camp visit the major tourist 
 attractions of Cornwall and the local 
 beaches at Polzeath, Daymer and Rock. </content>
