		<title>11ST JOHN THE BAPTIST CHURCH</title>
		<content>{St John the Baptist}was built in 1902.
                                       
 In 1960 they chopped the roof off     
 because it was too heavy and the      
 church was sinking. They put tiles on 
 instead. There is a bell with HMS     
 Tilbury 1918 which came from a boat   
 which was sunk in the First World War.
                                       
 The Bible was on the lectern and we   
 stood in the pulpit as the Vicar would
 stand on Sunday. We saw the Tabernacle
 and Baptism Font and statues and      
 organ.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
