		<title>04Holmes and surrounding area.</title>
		<content> The area of Holmes is quite flat and  
 good for riding your bicycles.        
   Which ever way you look you see big 
 open fields which always seem to be   
 green or greenhouses. The highest part
 is only about 12 metres above sea     
 level and the hamlet itself is about 6
 or 7 metres above sea level.          
    In Holmes it is quiet but it is all
 to do with what time of year it is. If
 it is Winter it is very quiet because 
 crops are not being grown. If it is   
 Summer then everbody is busy because  
 crops are ready to go to market. If it
 is Spring or Autumn it is alright but 
 it is still a bit busy. In Spring     
 people are planting and sowing corn , 
 potatoes , onions and other           
 vegetables. In Autum they are busy    
 harvesting the crops. You will see    
 more tractors than other vehicles.
