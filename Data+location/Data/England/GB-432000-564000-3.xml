		<title>03GAMES I LIKE TO PLAY</title>
		<content> I like to play a game called{British  
{Bulldog.}You have one player in the   
 middle of a big square. The other     
 players have to run across the square 
 and reach the other side without being
 caught. If you are caught you must    
 stay in the middle with the others who
 are 'on'. We keep running back and    
 forwards until everyone is caught.    
 Another game I like to play is {table 
{football.}In this game there is a     
 wooden board with sides and two teams 
 of players on metal bars. On the end  
 of each bar there is a handle.        
 Twisting the handle makes the players 
 kick the ball and pushing and pulling 
 it moves them sideways across the     
 table. Two or four people can play    
 this game. There is a small football  
 and you have to score in each others  
 goals. Sometimes we time the games and
 other times its the first to 10 goals.</content>
