		<content>We live in the Elham valley.In our area
we have many fields for crops(ie.wheat,
barley,oilseed rape and sweet-corn) and
grazing.There are areas of deciduous   
trees,some coppice, others parkland    
(with trees as old as 300 years).Using 
a chalky bank and grade 2 rich         
alluvial soil for comparative          
growth,one local farmer is             
experimenting with the growth of       
lupins and sunflowers.The hills are    
made of chalk ridges,that were once at 
the bottom of the sea,and contain the  
remains of hundreds of sea creatures.  
In time the earth changed shape.Now    
the sea bottom is well above sea       
level,forming our hills.There are      
also clay layers and flints.The flints 
were used for building locally.There   
are several examples in the village of 
Barham.Local water is pumped from      
underground where it has reached clay. </content>
