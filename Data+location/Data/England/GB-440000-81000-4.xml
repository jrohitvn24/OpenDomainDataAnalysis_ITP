		<title>04BRIGHSTONE CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The pretty church in Brighstone is   
 dedicated to St. Mary The Virgin. It  
 was built about 800 years ago to cope 
 with the increasing population. It is 
 the daughter church to the older one  
 at Calbourne.                         
  We were allowed to climb up to the   
 top of the tower, the spiral steps    
 were very narrow. When we reached the 
 top it was breezy. From there we      
 could see the whole of Brighstone.    
 Coming down we stopped to look at the 
 bells.Recently a colony of bats has   
 taken up residence in the belfry      
 making more regular cleaning          
 essential!                            
  The church has boards with           
 information on them for tourists. The 
 stained glass windows are very        
 beautiful. Around them there are      
 scrolls and leaves painted on the     
 wall.                                 </content>
