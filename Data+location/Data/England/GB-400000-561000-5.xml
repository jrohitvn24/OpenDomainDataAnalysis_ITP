 church services and praying for       
 everyone everyday.

 people. Mr. Hardy holds funerals and  
 later he visits the relatives of the  
 person who has just died and comforts 
 them. He goes to visit people who are 
 sick and talks to the old people as   
 well.                                 
 Every month he writes the Parish News 
 and every two months he writes the    
 Deanery Digest.                       
 The Rev. Malcolm Adams is the Minister
 of the Methodist Chapel in Riding Mill
