		<title>12HOUSES IN RAMSGATE</title>
		<content>Our sector covers the area from        
Ramsgate town centre to the south      
eastern edge of town.The town centre   
houses are almost all terraced ones    
more than a century old.In the middle  
area,the houses are still mainly       
terraced ones but quite large, 3 or 4  
storeys high.Approaching the edge of   
town,most houses are 2 storeyed        
terraced ones,built around the 1880's  
Beyond this is an area of   expensive  
detached houses built in the 1930's.On 
the edge of town is Nethercourt        
Estate, consisting of houses and       
bungalows built since the 1960's.The   
three newest estates, St.Benedicts     
Lawn,St.Augustines Park and the Convent
Estate have all been built in recent   
years on land sold by the Roman        
Catholic Church.House prices have      
almost trebled in the past ten years.  
This area has no council houses.       </content>
