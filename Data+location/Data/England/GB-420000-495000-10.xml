		<title>10WORSHIP IN CATTERICK AREA</title>
		<content> The anglican churches of St Anne at   
 Catterick and Holy Trinity church     
 Tunstall along with the Methodist     
 Chapel Catterick are all open for     
 worship. The Methodist Chapel is very 
 poorly supported, only six families   
 worship there, wheras the anglican    
 churches have a healthy congregation  
 whose constant support keeps the      
 buildings in good repair. The         
 worshippers organize fund raising     
 events to keep the churches           
 financially sound and these events are
 well supported even by non-church     
 goers. There are more intermittent    
 worshippers than regular ones. But it 
 is a caring society, eager to help its
 neighbours in times of trouble and    
 rejoice with them on happy occassions.
 Religion is still the backbone of most
 families way of life.
