		<title>14RECREATION - Horse Riding</title>
		<content> An interview was held with a girl from
 Brierton School who keeps horses in   
 the area. She has 5 horses ranging    
 from 2 years old to 15 years old. They
 include one thoroughbred, two Welsh   
 horses and one which was bought in    
 foal. Next to the field where she     
 keeps them is an indoor riding        
 centre (beside Three Gates Farm). The 
 centre was built in the mid 1970's and
 holds monthly competitions in jumping 
 and dressage during the winter. Up to 
 100 riders use the centre although its
 popularity has declined with the      
 growth of other centres in the        
 region.The Pony Club, the Saddle Club 
 and private individuals are all       
 involved in its organisation and one  
 Junior International who lives nearby 
 uses it often
