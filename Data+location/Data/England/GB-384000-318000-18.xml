sweets,biscuits,toothbrushes,china,    
glass,and flowers.{and lots of other   
things}The shop opens at half past     
seven and closes at six.It is open     
every day.Most of the provisions are   
fetched by the owner from a big whole- 
salers.Special biscuits  are delivered 
to the shop in a beautiful red van and 
the flowers come from the nursery.Two  
or three people work in the shop and   
use an electric till,which gives       
receipts.Part of the shop is a Post    
Office where Family Allowance and      
Pensions are paid,parcels weighed and  
stamps sold.The postman collects       
letters and parcels and puts them on a 
train to go to the sorting office.     </content>
