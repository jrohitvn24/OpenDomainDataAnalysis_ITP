 Grovehill and the open country. There 
 are 2 artificial{cricket}pitches and 4
{football}pitches. Several adult       
 football teams play there and some of 
 the boys train there with the Hemel   
 Dolphins, a boys team that plays in   
 the Bushey friendly league. There is a
{BMX track}(see p.14) and a children's 
 playground with some swings, seesaws, 
 slides, and a climbing frame.         
 There are some new{allotments}and a   
{nature reserve}created by a local     
 primary school and called Bank's Wood 
 after one of their teachers. They     
 planted trees and left some of it to  
 grow wild.

 the playing area where horses from
