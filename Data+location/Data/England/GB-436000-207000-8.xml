		<title>08Trees and Hedgerows</title>
		<content> The commonest tree around Cogges and  
Witney is the Willow. This tree grows  
along both banks of the River Windrush 
and all the trees have been pollarded  
in the past. The willow wood is no     
longer needed for hurdle making or for 
thatching corn ricks and so now they   
are only pollarded to prevent them from
growing too big so branches break off. 
 Many of the hedgerows which divided up
the fields have been removed over the  
last ten or so years to enlarge fields 
for the large machinery. This is most  
often where grain is grown. All that is
left of these hedges is an occasional  
oak tree which has been left standing. 
 There are still a few dead elm trees  
standing, (+ 1 alive) but mostly only  
pieces of trunk lie around. In hedges  
we found mostly hawthorn, briar, sloe, 
bramble. The wildest hedgerows were on 
the abandoned railway track.           </content>
