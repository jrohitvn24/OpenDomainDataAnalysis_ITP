		<content>{BY HELEN WRIGHT AGED 7 YEARS          
 ON FRIDAY I CAME TO SCHOOL WITH MY MUM
 AND THE BUS HAD ARRIVED WHEN WE       
 CAME.  EVERYBODY GOT ON THE BUS AND WE
 HAD TO GO.  WE WERE HALF WAY TO RIDING
 MILL WHEN SCOTT'S DAD CAME UP TO THE  
 FRONT AND SAID HE HAD LEFT THE        
 PUSHCHAIR BEHIND AND THAT THE BUS     
 WOULD HAVE TO TURN BACK.  WE STOPPED  
 AT THE PUB AND SCOTT'S DAD RAN DOWN TO
 SCHOOL AND GOT THE PUSHCHAIR.  THEN WE
 WERE OFF AGAIN.  AT LAST WE GOT TO THE
 ZOO, AND WE SAW THE ELEPHANT, IT WAS  
 SAD.  THEN WE SAW THE ORANG UTANS,    
 THEY WERE FUNNY, THEN WE MADE OUR WAY 
 TO THE OTTERS, THEY WERE YELLOW.  THEN
 WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE SMALL ANIMIAL  
 HANDLING CLASS.  WE HANDLED RATS AND  
 TOADS AND OTHER THINGS, AND THEN I    
 WENT TO THE ZOO SHOP AND GOT SOME     
 THINGS .  THEN I WENT TO THE MONKEY   
 HOUSE.                                </content>
