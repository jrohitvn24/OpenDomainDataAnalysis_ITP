		<content>Help the Aged survives through peoples 
personal contributions.Old people are  
lonely so the Social Services run day  
centres.In the day centres they can    
do keep-fit,computers and there are    
hair-dressers,they have hot meals and  
have a mini-bus to collect them and    
bring them back.ST.JohnÂ£s is a         
sheltered unit for elderly in need.The 
warden is called Mrs Olive. There are  
dinner ladies who cook the dinners.    
The day we came we had Roast pork,roast
potatoes brussel sprouts,for pudding we
had Ice Cream and chocolate            
sauce.Voluntary services take          
lunches to some homes which cost 65p.  
The day at St Johns was very           
interesting and we enjoyed it all      
very much. BY Samantha Brown and Andrew
Hayward.
