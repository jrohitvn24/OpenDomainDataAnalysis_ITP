		<content> For the best point of view on local   
 ECOLOGY we visited the local artist   
 Gordan Benningfield at Water End.He   
 claims that much land is sprayed with 
 PESTICIDES unnecessarily &amp; some spray 
 is too powerful. Sprays damage        
 flowers,kill insects &amp; birds &amp; cause  
 various allergies.Most countries have 
 banned their use but unfortunately    
 there is no such ban in Britain.Few   
 people realise the extent of damage   
 that has been caused since 1945.      
 The river Gade contains rainbow trout 
 which are put in by fishing syndicates
 and brown trout that are already there
 naturally.Voles &amp; birds nest along the
 banks.Kingfishers,herons and bitterns 
 are often seen in the area.The        
 WOODLAND in the Gade Valley is        
 inhabited by animals like badgers,    
 stoats,deer &amp; foxes.Some woodland is  
 THREATENED by building developments   </content>
