 LIFE IN CHEDZOY.THERE ARE NOW ONLY TWO
 FARMS IN THE CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE,   
 DALTON'S AND SIBLEY'S.DALTON'S IS     
 A BEEF FARM AND SIBLEY'S A DAIRY FARM.
 THE CATTLE KEPT FOR MILKING ARE ALL   
 BRITISH FRIESIANS.BEEF CATTLE ARE     
 OFTEN CROSSED WITH HEREFORDS OR       
 CHAROLLAIS.THE COWS ARE MILKED TWICE A
 DAY.THE MILK IS STORED IN BULK TANKS  
 AND KEPT COOL.IT IS STIRRED BY AN     
 AUTOMATIC PADDLE TO MIX IN THE CREAM. 
 IN SUMMER THE COWS GRAZE ON THE RICH  
 GRASS OF SEDGEMOOR.IN WINTER THEY ARE 
 FED SILAGE,GREEN GRASS PRESERVED BY   
 SQUEEZING OUT THE JUICE AND KEEPING IT
 IN AN AIR TIGHT CLAMP,OR HAY,DRIED    
 GRASS.NO MAIZE IS GROWN HERE NOW,THO' 
 IT HAS BEEN TRIED.CORN,POTATOES AND   
 MANGOLDS ARE THE OTHER MAIN CROPS.

 VERY MECHANISED IN THIS AREA.         </content>
