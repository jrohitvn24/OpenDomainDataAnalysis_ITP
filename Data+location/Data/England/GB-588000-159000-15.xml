		<title>15ATTITUDES YOUNG AND ELDERLY</title>
		<content>Teenagers do not, on the whole, like   
living in this area .It is too far from
town for shopping,school and work.In   
addition there are few entertainments  
and amusements,such as discos,provided 
for young people in the villages.There 
used to be a youth club in Bredgar but 
it closed due to lack of numbers.Elerly
people tend to like living in the area.
It is peaceful,quiet, with abundant    
wildlife and is a pleasant place to    
spend their last years.They appreciate 
the sense of community which still     
exists,most often centred on the local 
church.Local organisations such as the 
Women's Institute and Bredgar Singers  
arrange activities which the elderly   
appear to enjoy.Both young and old     
complain about public transport.It is  
too infrequent,expensive and does not  
serve all the villages in the area.
