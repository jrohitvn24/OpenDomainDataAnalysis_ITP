		<title>14A Typical Garden</title>
		<content> My garden is a typical one.It goes    
 all the way round the house and has   
 a path through the middle.The garden  
 has bushes at one end.There is a      
{stream}in my garden it is not very    
 deep but it is muddy.There are lot of 
 trees in my garden.They are very old  
 like my house. The garden is about    
 half an acre.  It has a back          
 yard,which is made of brick. There are
 two{apple trees}which are in  the back
 yard.                                 
     There are many plants and flowers 
 and an old garage which is falling    
 down.Most of the trees  are willow    
 trees,bending over towards the stream.
 There are about five flower beds in   
 the garden and they are near the      
 house.
