		<content>        THE HOLLIES.                   
                                       
  The Hollies scheme in Midsomer Norton
 has been developed over the last year.
 It was due to open last christmas, but
 because it wasn't ready they moved the
 date forward to July. Then they moved 
 the date forward again and it should  
 be opening on the 16th of August . The
 biggest part of the Hollies           
 development will house a new          
 supermarket called Safeway's which is 
 a big establishment. It will also     
 contain lots of different shops in a  
 pedestrian precinct. Some of these    
 include: a newsagent, a dry cleaners, 
 a car accesory shop, a coffee bar and 
 asome kiosks.                         
 This development has caused alot of   
 argument locally. It was built on the 
 site of a public garden and improve   
 the existing council offices.         </content>
