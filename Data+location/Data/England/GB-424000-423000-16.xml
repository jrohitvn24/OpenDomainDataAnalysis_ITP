  In underground tig we get into a     
 circle and dip to see who is on.The   
 last two people who are left are      
 on.The rest have to go against a wall 
 and put one of their arms against the 
 wall and one of the people who are on 
 has to go under them. And they all    
 have to run away.The  two people who  
 are on have to run after them.If they 
 tig them then they have to go against 
 the wall and put their arm out .If    
 someone is not tug and goes under the 
 person who is tug ,the person who is  
 tug can run again.If everybody is     
 caught,the first and last are on.
