		<title>02Whiteley Village-History</title>
		<content>{William Whiteley}was born in          
 1831 in the north of England. He      
 opened a shop in London, and as he    
 made more money this grew to become a 
 large department store. He arranged in
 his will for part of his fortune to be
 used to build a village of small      
 houses for his retired workers. In    
 1907 he was shot dead by his son, and 
 soon after this date the building of  
 the village began.                    
 The first World War brought a halt to 
 building, and the village was         
 officially opened by King George V and
 Queen Mary on May 28th 1921. They used
 a "golden" key, which is displayed,   
 with photographs and newspaper        
 cuttings in the clubhouse.They planted
 two trees outside the main church,    
 opposite the hospital.These trees were
 PINUS CEMBRA.
