		<title>18CHURCH FARM   HISTORY</title>
		<content> A{stone axe}over 4000 years old was   
 found here so the land has been       
 settled for a long time. The farm     
 was built as a{Long House}in the      
 1400's and was open to the roof with  
 holes to let out smoke. Probably      
 people chose to live there because of:
 the soil, nearby supplies of stone and
 trees, springs. It must have been an  
 important house because there is a    
 field called{conigre}where rabbits    
 were bred. Only lords of the manor    
 were allowed to have these. The house 
 has a well 2m. wide and 7m. deep. It  
 is covered by flagstones in the       
 kitchen now. Later on ,in Elizabeth   
 1st's reign, the house was divided    
 into two storeys and shaped like a    
 capital{"E" for Elizabeth.}The family 
 who live there can trace their tree   
 back 500 years.
