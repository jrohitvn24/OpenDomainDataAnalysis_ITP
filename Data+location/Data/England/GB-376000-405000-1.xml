		<content> RADCLIFFE, A SMALL INDUSTRIAL TOWN OF 
 30 501 PEOPLE IS PART OF THE          
 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF BURY IN THE   
 COUNTY OF GREATER MANCHESTER.         
 TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES OF COTTON AND  
 PAPER HAVE DECLINED IN FAVOUR OF      
 ENGINEERING _ BUT HERE TOO THERE HAS  
 BEEN A DECLINE WITH THE CLOSURE OF    
 FIRMS CAUSING REDUNDANCIES AND A HIGH 
 RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT.                 
 THE MANCHESTER BURY BOLTON CANAL AND  
 RIVER IRWELL HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT IN 
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOWN.          
 NEW LOW DENSITY HOUSING ESTATES,      
 MAINLY PRIVATE, HAVE BEEN RECENTLY    
 BUILT, FOLLOWING THE DEMOLITION OF    
 MANY PRE FIRST WAR TERRACED HOUSING.  
 DESPITE ITS INDUSTRIAL NATURE         
 RADCLIFFE HAS SOME DAIRY FARMS. THE   
 TOWN HAS A FOOTBALL CLUB IN THE NORTH 
 WEST COUNTIES LEAGUE AND A CRICKET    
 CLUB. THERE ARE 2 SECONDARY SCHOOLS.  </content>
