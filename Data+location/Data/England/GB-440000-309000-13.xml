		<title>13HOW A YOUNGSTER SEES IBSTOCK</title>
		<content>     Ibstock is quite big compared to  
 some villages in Leicestershire. It   
 could be improved by having better    
 shops and better toilet facilities.   
     The people are very friendly and  
 the houses are near to the shops.     
     There could be more parks for     
 children, an outdoor swimming pool and
 tennis courts because if you want to  
 do some thing like this you have to   
 travel at least three miles.          
     There are three schools in the    
 village, a few pubs and bingo places  
 if you fancy that sort of thing.      
     I don't like people who write on  
 walls because they make Ibstock look a
 mess.                                 
     Melbourne Road has too many fast  
 cars whizzing past. You can't see them
 coming when you cross the road.
