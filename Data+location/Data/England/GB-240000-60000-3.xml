 There is a DOCTOR'S and DENTIST'S     
 SURGERY held in Cargreen once a       
 week. The nearest hospital is at      
 Saltash - 6 miles distant, providing  
 minimal facilities. The main hospital 
 service is in Plymouth - 11 miles     
 distant. There is a DISTRICT NURSE    
 service as and when required, and a   
 HOME HELP service for the elderly and 
 disabled. There is a large proportion 
 of elderly people in the village.     
 Their recreational needs are catered  
 for by an organisation known as the   
 'Good Companions', and younger        
 villagers also keep an eye on the     
 welfare of the elderly.
