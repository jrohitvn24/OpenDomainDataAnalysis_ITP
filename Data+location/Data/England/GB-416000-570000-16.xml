		<title>16CHANGES IN PONTELAND.</title>
		<content> Mr.William Abbey,79,is a{shoemaker and
 repairer,in the village of Ponteland. 
 He came to{Ponteland} at the age of   
 14 from Malton,Yorkshire.He served his
 time in the tanneries,repairing shoes.
 He returned to Ponteland and found    
 himself a job.He later became         
 caretaker at our school,Coates Endowed
 Middle where he{retired}aged 65.      
  We asked him what he thought about   
 how the village has changed:"The      
 village of Ponteland was a very nice  
 little village,with very few houses   
 and shops,but enough to satisfy the   
 local population.Today 50 years on    
 it's all built up,like a town,farms   
 have been taken over and banks built. 
 The old vicarage is now a Rest Home.  
 All of the shops have been changed and
 modernised.Ponteland has changed      
 considerably not always for the best."
