Staverton Park is ancient woodland with
oak, holly and some birch trees.  It   
contains the tallest holly tree in     
Britain.  Many oaks are pollarded, and 
are unusually shaped.  The deer park is
estimated to be 600 years old.         
                                       
Aldewood Forest is managed by the      
Forestry Commission.  These are        
coniferous and a few diciduous trees,  
with more of the latter being planted. 
First plantations were after World War 
One, prior to which this was heathland.
It is now the home of fallow deer and  
decreasing numbers of red squirrels    
since the grey arrived in 1974.        
                                       
Eyke Parish takes part in a Council    
organised tree planting scheme, and has
planted birches on the Recreation      
Ground boundary.                       </content>
