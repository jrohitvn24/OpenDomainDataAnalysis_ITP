		<content> for a few of the villagers in the     
 shops and hostelaries, but apart from 
 the local chair-works which employs a 
 good number of people, most of the    
 others work in the towns of Longridge,
 Preston and Clitheroe, and most of    
 these travel to work by car, nearly   
 every family having one, and many     
 families having two and even three    
 cars. Not many people are employed on 
 the farms these days, due to          
 mechanisation of many farming         
 activities.
