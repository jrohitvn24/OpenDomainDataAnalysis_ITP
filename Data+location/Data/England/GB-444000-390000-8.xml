		<title>08LEISURE CENTRE ROTHERHAM</title>
		<content> The Leisure Centre is a large building
 next to the Herringthorpe playing     
 fields.Inside there is a large number 
 of activities to choose from, such as 
 swimming,keep fit, judo, badminton,   
 tennis, gymnastics, squash,           
 playgroups, rollerskating,and archery.
      To get inside you have to go up a
 slope into the entrance where you pay 
 the price for what ever you want to   
 do.The prices are quite expensive.    
      It is very busy on Saturdays and 
 even busier on a Sunday  but the rest 
 of the week it is quite empty so it is
 better to go in the week than at the  
 weekends.Most of the facilities are   
 very good but some of them could be   
 made alot better.The ones that could  
 be improved are the pool,the squash   
 couts, and the gymnastics facilities.
