		<content>   GIBBET HILL, 272 METRES ABOVE SEA   
 LEVEL, IS THE SECOND HIGHEST POINT IN 
 SURREY AND THE HIGHEST IN HINDHEAD. IT
 IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE IN LOCAL      
 HISTORY.                              
  GIBBET HILL GAINED ITS NOTORIETY AS A
 RESULT OF A MURDER COMITTED NEARBY IN 
 I786. AN UNNAMED SAILOR WALKING       
 BETWEEN LONDON AND PORTSMOUTH WAS     
 BEFRIENDED BY THREE PENNILESS SAILORS.
 THE UNNAMED SAILOR AGREED TO TREAT    
 THEM TO FOOD AND DRINK AT THE RED LION
 INN, THURSLEY.NEAR THE DEVIL'S        
 PUNCHBOWL, THE THREE SAILORS SET UPON 
 THE UNKNOWN SAILOR, BEAT HIM AND      
 ROBBED HIM.HOWEVER, TWO LABOURERS WHO 
 HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THEM ALONG THE     
 ROAD, SAW THE SAILOR'S BODY AND       
 GUESSING WHO THE MURDERERS WERE       
 FOLLOWED THEM TO SHEET, NEAR          
 PETERSFIELD. THE SUSPECTS WERE FOUND  
 GUILTY AND HANGED ON GIBBET HILL.     </content>
