		<title>10OFFCHURCH, ITS CHANGING FACE</title>
		<content>  {Offchurch, "the church founded or   
{owned by Offa",}has traditionally been
 associated with King Offa (757-769).  
{  Legend}tells us that Offa's son or  
 nephew, Fremund, was murdered and     
 buried in Offchurch.  Today local     
 people recall the legend and the      
 present Parish Church of St.Gregory   
 serves as a reminder of the original  
 church of the same name built by      
 King Offa.                            
  {Older people,}natives of Offchurch, 
 have noticed changes taking place.    
 Once the inhabitants would have made  
 their livelihood through agriculture  
 but today most people find work away  
 from the village.{ The Village School,
{the Convent and the Post Office have  
{closed down.}As the village has       
 expanded,{traffic}has increased and   
 sadly there are{fewer trees}to be     
 seen.                                 </content>
