		<title>11STANDEAN FARM</title>
		<content> Standean is a large farm on the Downs.
 On it there are about 1OOO sheep and  
 8O beef cattle. Crops grown on this   
 94O acre farm are wheat, barley, oats,
 turnips, swede and corn. Two crawler  
 tractors, 1 four wheel drive tractor, 
 2 small tractos and 1 combine         
 harvester are the main machines used. 
 There are 3 people working on the     
 farm. Diseases that occur on the farm 
 are fungi on corn and insects,        
 maggots, lice and sheep's scab on     
 sheep. The corn gets sprayed for weeds
 and the animals are dipped in         
 preventative medicine. The farmer, a  
 tenant, has been farming for about 43 
 years. He has a turnover of Â£2OO,OOO  
 per annum. Major problems are the     
 large flints and the cost of tractor  
 tyres at Â£14OO a set. The EEC also    
 affects him as there is no milk       
 production now. Wild life is preserved</content>
