		<title>07THE BLACKSMITH AT MONTFORD</title>
		<content> Mr Richard Roberts has been a         
 blacksmith at Montford Bridge for more
 than 50 years.  Born in the village he
 became an apprentice blacksmith in his
 teens.  In those days work came from  
 local farms because nearly every      
 village had its own blacksmith.       
 Today, however, with the decline of   
 blacksmiths, his catchment area covers
 villages up to 20 miles away.         
                                       
 Mr. Roberts says the work has also    
 changed.  "When I began, the work was 
 all furnace work; shoeing horses and  
 wheelrighting.  Today it's nearly     
 all work for an electric welder like  
 making gates and wagons for farms and 
 carrying out repairs on modern farm   
 implements".  Mr. Roberts still       
 enjoys his work and would like to see 
 more young people interested in the   
 profession.                           </content>
