		<title>14R. G. LANCELYN_GREEN</title>
		<content> Rodger Lancelyn_Green was born in     
 November 1918 in Norfolk. He tried    
 various jobs such as acting, school   
 master, book_seller and deputy        
 librarian at Merton College, Oxford.  
 His first love, writing, was not      
 earning him any money.                
    The first thing that he tried to   
 publish was a "ghastly horror story"  
 (his own words) for a boys' magazine  
 printed in Dundee. The first proper   
 work he tried to have published was a 
 book of poetry in 1945. From 1946 he  
 started taking literary work          
 seriously. In 1950 he returned to the 
 Wirral. Since then he has written     
 almost 60 books, one being "The       
 World's End" (a children's fantasy),  
 he wrote mostly fantasies about       
 dragons etc. Now aged 66 he has nearly
 ceased writting.
