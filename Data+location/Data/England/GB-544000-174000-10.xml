		<content> About 1/3 of people interviewed use   
 the Crook Log Sports Centre which was 
 opened in 1982.                       
 Swimming and badminton are the most   
 popular sports,then come squash,keep  
 fit,weight training,judo and karate   
 Crook Log Swimming Baths has been     
 re-named SPLASHWORLD because it has   
 recently opened the Aquazoom Tubes_   
 named Sidewinder and Vortex.There is  
 only one other like it in the rest of 
 London.You descend about 150 feet     
 through a tube and land in a pool at  
 the bottom.It costs one pound fifty   
 pence for ten rides.                  
 Football is the most popular team game
 for boys and there are many local     
 amateur clubs for all ages.The best   
 club here is Welling United who play  
 in the Southern Premier League.       
 Girls play mostly netball  and hockey 
 for their team games.                 </content>
