 There is a Playgroup in Worth for     
 children of pre-school age. The child-

 half of the grid go to Worth School   
 and those in the southern half to     
 Mongeham or Northbourne. Older child- 
 ren attend Sandwich Secondary School  
 or Manwood's Grammar in Sandwich. Most
 young children are taken to school by 
 private car, older ones usually cycle.
