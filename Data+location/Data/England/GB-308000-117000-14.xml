		<title>14My day at school.</title>
		<content> On Tuesday I come to school and play  
 outside. When the bell rings I go in  
 my classroom and read my book. We read
 till ten o'clock and then we do our   
 news which is about everything we do  
 at the weekend. Then we do our Maths. 
 For our Maths we weigh things and do  
 ordinary sums. At twelve o'clock we   
 pack up and get ready for dinner. The 
 school dinner people go over to dinner
 and the sandwich people put their     
 lunch boxes out. Then they play. When 
 the school dinners come out, the      
 sandwich people go in and the school  
 dinner people play. Then the bell goes
 and we go in to school for our        
 afternoon work. At three-fifteen we go
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
