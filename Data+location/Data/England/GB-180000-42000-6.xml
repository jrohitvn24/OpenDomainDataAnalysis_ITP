		<content> The two main forms of employment are  
 found in the primary or tertiary      
 service sectors. In the southern part 
 of the area farming is the major form 
 of employment whilst public, community
 and commercial employment dominates in
 the northern sector. A small amount of
 manufacturing or storage takes place  
 on the riverside. Employment in the   
 primary sector accounts for 6.2% of   
 the working population, manufacturing 
 accounts for 2.8%, construction 4.5%  
 and the service industry 83.6%.Truro  
 shopping centre provides employment   
 mostly for part-time women workers,   
 who are below the National Insurance  
 threshold. Also there is a small      
 nucleus of full-time employees.       
 Unemployment in Cornwall is  15.9%,   
 but only 10.9% in Truro and falling,  
 as Truro grows as the major service   
 centre for Cornwall.                  </content>
