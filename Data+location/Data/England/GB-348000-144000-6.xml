		<title>06Tourist Attractions</title>
		<content>  In this area there are many          
 attractions for the tourist. Walking  
 in the area is varied as there are    
 hills on one side of the road,the     
 B3139,and lowland moors on the other. 
 The road itself was originally a      
 Turnpike Trust which connected with   
 the railway at Highbridge and it now  
 runs to Burnham-on-Sea,a popular      
 seaside resort. Since Burnham is only 
 about 15 miles from the Wookey to     
 Bleadney area it is easily accessible 
 to tourists staying there.            
  The other major attraction for       
 tourists staying in this area is the  
 Cheddar Gorge which is about 10 miles 
 away.It is the nearest thing in Great 
 Britain to a canyon and is extremely  
 impressive. It also contains some     
 splendid show caves.
