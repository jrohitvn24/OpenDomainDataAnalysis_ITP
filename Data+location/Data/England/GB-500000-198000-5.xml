  Life in Chenies Today:               
 In Chenies there are no shops at all  
 and most people go to Chesham to do   
 their shopping.The last shop closed   
 ten years ago.There are no medical    
 services such as hospitals,doctors or 
 dentists.Most people work out-side the
 village.Many travel to London and     
 Birmingham. There are three farms,but 
 farm workers come from outside the    
 village.Most of the houses are very   
 old some over 400 years old.With      
 wattle and daub walls and ceilings.The
 houses are scattered all over the     
 village.There are about 100 houses.   </content>
