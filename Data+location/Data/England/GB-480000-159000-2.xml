		<content> Yateley lies in the fertile area of   
 the Blackwater Valley and has a very  
 sandy soil with gravel and a layer of 
 clay underneath.  The extraction of   
 gravel has led to the creation of     
 several tracts of water which provide 
 recreational facilities.  The higher  
 parts of the area are mainly heathland
 and scrub.  The name Yateley is said  
 to come from Yat - a gate - and ley - 
 a clearing in a wood.  A large part of
 the heathland is now a country park   
 with rangers to look after it and is  
 a conservation area, and has an       
 enormous amount of wildlife, including
 badger setts which have been here for 
 over 150 years.  A nature trail has   
 been in existence for many years.     
 Some of this area is now becoming     
 wooded as birch and pine take         
 over.There are several picnic areas.
