		<title>12The school in Herm.</title>
		<content> Herm has one primary school for all   
 children resident on the island.      
 The school is housed in a building at 
 the top of the hill, and comprises one
 classroom, with a storage area and    
 toilet. The school caters for children
 from 4 to 11 years old. Children older
 than 11 would have to board at a      
 school in Guernsey or on the mainland.
 At present there are 10 children in   
 the school, 6 boys and 4 girls,       
 ranging in age from 4 to 8 years old. 
 The school is run by the States of    
 Guernsey and provided with equipment  
 and a teacher by them. For many years 
 the teacher had been a resident of    
 Herm,and a door from the school led to
 a cottage for the teacher, but in     
 1983 a teacher resident in Guernsey   
 was appointed to Herm, and she travels
 by boat to Herm each day.
