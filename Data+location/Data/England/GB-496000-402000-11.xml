 Wold farm foods (a local farming      
 co-operative ).Other crops like       
 potatoes and fruit orchards are for   
 family use.The family labour force of 
 3 live in the farmhouse, 2 other      
 workers 1 part-time live in the       
 village.Decisions on farming policy   
 are made by the family although       
 sometimes the advice gien by company
