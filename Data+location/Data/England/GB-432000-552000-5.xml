		<content>   From the roof of Shiney Row School  
 we were able to take a panoramic      
 photograph which shows the area to the
 north east of the school. We can see  
 five hills the largest being{Penshaw  
{Hill}with the monument to Lord Lambton
 the pit owner. We can also see the    
 man-made hill of{Herrington Pit Heap  
 and to the right of this the winding  
 tower of Herrington Colliery.         
   In front of these hills we can see  
 the{terraced houses}of Shiney Row with
 their back-yards and{pigeon crees,}the
 old Miners Welfare Hall, now a jig-saw
 factory and the new{YMCA}at Herrington
 Burn. There are the Engine Works and  
{Bus Depot}at Philadelphia and the new 
 Bungalows at the end of Success Road. 
   In the foreground we can see fields 
 with horses and the{piggery}and the   
 "black path" leading to the{burn}     
 (small stream) and the barley field.  </content>
