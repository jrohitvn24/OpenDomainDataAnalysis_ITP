		<title>06St Martin's College      (M)</title>
		<content>The buildings used by the college used 
to be Bowerham Barracks.The old and    
the new parts look very different from 
each other.Just before the main gate   
there is the new library.It has funny  
shapes,lots of glass and concrete.     
The main gate is old and has places    
for big lamps on top so that the       
coachmen were able to see in the dark. 
265 students live in the college.They  
live in what were the Men's Quarters.  
These buildings are long and plain.    
There are over 1000 students there,    
from all over England training to be   
teachers.They chose one main subject   
but have to do lots of other shorter   
courses as well.They also have to      
spend time teaching in schools.We      
have some students in our school at    
the moment.
