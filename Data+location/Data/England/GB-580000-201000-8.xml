		<content> The Hill Farm Russian Colony          
      There are some recorded papers   
 saying that around the turn of the    
 century some Russian Colonies were set
 up in Britain and they started off    
 business in the Cock Clarks area.     
    In Russia at the same time a       
 business man asked the Russian        
 Goverment if he could set up a        
 printing press business.The Goverment 
 said no so himself his family and     
 close friends moved to Cock Clarks    
 secretly.                             
    At Hill Farm they founded the      
 printing press.The windows are big    
 because the printing presses were     
 displayed.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
