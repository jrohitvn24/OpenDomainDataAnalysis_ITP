		<title>05INTERVIEW WITH RESIDENT</title>
		<content> In an interview with a retired teacher
 from Dane Valley High School we asked 
 some questions about her life in      
 Congleton.We found that she likes     
 living on Congleton Edge because it is
 peaceful and isolated from town bustle
 .Congleton provides all her needs and 
 she seldom travels far.She feels that 
 there have been some significant      
 changes: the small shops have been    
 replaced by supermarkets;The main     
 street has been pedestrianized;The    
 construction of a town by-pass has    
 been completed.She told us that       
 Congleton Edge used to have small     
 holdings where the owners used to work
 down the mines and tend cattle in     
  their spare time.It has now been     
 re-developed as housing for the       
 wealthy.Only recently has water and   
 electricity been suplied to the houses
 ,previously wells were used.          </content>
