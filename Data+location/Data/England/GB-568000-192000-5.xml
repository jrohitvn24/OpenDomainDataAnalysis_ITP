		<content> Mrs Dale Hollingsworth's farm is at   
 Crays Hill. This mixed farm has a     
 dairy herd and cattle raised for      
 beef.Much of the 500 acres is used    
 for grazing,peas,barley and wheat are 
 grown.The farm employs six workers,two
 are Youth Training Scheme students.She
 breeds her Fresian herd using A.I.or  
 her own bull.She is a member of the   
 Rare Breeds Society and keeps an Old  
 English White Bull.Highland and short 
 horn cattle.When her cows become too  
 old she sends them to the abbattoir   
 and she is paid their worth on the    
 hoof.She disapproves of cattle        
 markets.Although this farmer is       
 interested in conservation and prefers
 the old methods,she uses artifical    
 fertiliserand sprays her crops against
 pests.She said,"The E.E.C. is a good  
 thing,a strong community working      
 together could help prevent war.      </content>
