		<title>15Children's Favourite Games 2</title>
		<content>  My favourite game is football a very 
 popular game in Long Lawford as       
 elsewhere.My favourite professional   
 team is Manchester United eventhough  
 the local side is Coventry City. There
 are many local amateur sides playing  
 football either on a Saturday or      
 Sunday and these are made up of both  
 children and adults.                  
  I have played soccer,as football is  
 properly called, for the school team  
 on a number of occasions,but nearly   
 every day I go out and play with a    
 ball in the nearby park.I play with a 
 group of other boys and often use our 
 jumpers laid on the ground as the goal
 posts. We usually know where the pitch
 side lines are by instinct and so     
 eventhough there are many arguments   
 just like in the real game we still   
 enjoy the game tremendously.
