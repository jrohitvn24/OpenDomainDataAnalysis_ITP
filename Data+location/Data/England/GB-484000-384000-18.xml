		<content> There is no Primary school in Upton so
 the young children in the village have
 to travel by coach to primary school's
 in other villages.My sister has to    
 travel to the village of Lea which is 
 about three miles away.               
 When I left Lea primary school I had a
 choice of two Secondary shools to go  
 to.Before I left Lea school I had a   
 chance to go to the Queen Elizabeth   
 High School in Gainsborough but I did 
 not qualify.My parents decided to send
 me to Middlefield School.             
 At the present time the schools in    
 Gainsborough are being re-organised   
 and some of the shools,might close    
 down and new ones open in their place.
 I hope that my school does not close  
 down because I think it is a good     
 school.
