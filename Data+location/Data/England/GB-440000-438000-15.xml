		<title>15Footpaths and Bridleways</title>
		<content> Public access varied from being good  
 to impossible. Many paths were        
 clearly waymarked, gave reasonable    
 access and had suitably constructed   
 stiles. A large number, particularly  
 footpaths, did not "exist" or had some
 variation on "Keep Out" displayed.    
 This made the collection of data      
 difficult in some cases as planned    
 routes had to be abandoned because of 
 lack of access.
