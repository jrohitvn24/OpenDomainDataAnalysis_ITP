		<title>01General review of the block</title>
		<content>The block covering our area consists   
mainly of farmland. Some of it         
cultivated but most of it not. Probably
80|85% of the block then is fields. The
most notable building in the block is  
Thurnham Hall,a small stately home     
dating from 13C. Another building of   
note is Ellel Hall,a large house       
privately occupied. Apart from         
farmhouses,the only other houses of    
note are about 20 bungalows forming a  
small estate near to the village of    
Glasson Dock. Also in the block is our 
school and the village church. A       
notable feature is the yacht basin,a   
stretch of water used for sailing and  
also where people actually live on     
boats.By the basin is a large building 
where boats of all kinds are maintained
and repaired.A junction of the         
Lancaster canal runs through the block 
and terminates in the yacht basin.     </content>
