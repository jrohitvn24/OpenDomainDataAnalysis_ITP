		<content>    This block contains three villages,
{Wingate, Wheatley Hill and Thornley.} 
 These are all mining communities which
 have relied on mining for employment  
 since the mid-eighteenth century.     
    All three collieries have since    
 closed and the related problems caused
 by this are constanlty in the minds of
 the local inhabitants. Consequently,  
 much of the information revolves      
 around the{search for replacement     
{industries}and the{return of the      
{surrounding countryside to its former 
{natural state.}                       
    Today there are virtually no visual
 signs that the mining industry ever   
 existed. The countryside is natural   
 and attractive once again.            
    Inwardly, however, there is still  
 some bitterness and resentment that a 
 state industry should withdraw leaving
 loyal workers without work.           </content>
