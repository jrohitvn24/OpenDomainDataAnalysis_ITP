		<content>{Whitchurch was named}after its church,
 St.Alkmunds,called the white church,  
 which collapsed and was rebuilt in    
 1711.{Whitchurch's most famous person 
 is John Talbot,1st Earl of Shrewsbury,
 born in 1386.He fought many battles   
 against the Welsh and French.He       
 defeated Owen Glendower and took his  
 wife and children prisoner.Sir John   
 was killed by the French and his heart
 is in the porch of St.Alkmunds Church.
 Sir Edward German was also born here. 
{There was once a fine castle}at Castle
 Court,but now flats have been built on
 top of it.Some of the castle bricks   
 have been used to line a bridge.When  
 they were digging the foundations for 
 Castle Court they discovered Roman    
 coins and a Roman pot.Every year on   
 November 11th there is a parade       
 starting at the War Memorial at Queens
 Road which finishes at the church.    </content>
