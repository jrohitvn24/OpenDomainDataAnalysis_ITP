		<content> Cuxton Social Club, which was opened  
 in 1922, is a place where families can
 enjoy a pleasant evening together.    
 Subscriptions are Â£5.25 a year, with  
 an entry fee of 45p. Everyone over 16 
 years of age is eligible to join, but 
 the Club is restricted to 700 members.
 The busiest times are Saturday        
 evening, Sunday lunchtime and evening.
 The most popular drink is "AK" which  
 is a light beer, and the most popular 
 games are darts and snooker.  Other   
 sub-sections of the Club include      
 football, cricket, golf, bat and trap,
 and horticulture. Every year a        
 children's Christmas party is held.   
 Since its beginning the Club has been 
 extended and improved and is now very 
 comfortable, with thick carpets and   
 plush chairs.
