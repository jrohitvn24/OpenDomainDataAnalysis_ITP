		<title>01South Lopham Waveney Country</title>
		<content> The fens drain into the Waveney at its
 source. The remainder of the 791      
 hectares cover gently undulating land 
 which produces crops mostly sugar     
 beet, also some pigs and sheep. Heavy 
 traffic splits the centre of the      
 village which is a conservation       
 area.The 17th century dwellings are   
 now outnumbered by modern houses, but 
 many are scattered throughout the     
 parish, which boasts only the White   
 Horse Inn and a sub Post Office.Main  
 necessities can still be delivered.   
 For the 374 inhabitants, there is     
 little local work, but no unemployment
 as jobs are found within a 12 mile    
 radius. Children start school in Norht
 Lopham and go on to Diss 5 miles      
 away.Hospitals are 20 miles away.     
 local doctors give excellent service. 
 Public Transport is almost non        
 existant.                             </content>
