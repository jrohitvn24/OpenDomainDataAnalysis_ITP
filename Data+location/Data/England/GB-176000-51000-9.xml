		<content> My home is a farm.Our farm is a       
 dairy farm.We have four milkers.We    
 milk our cows by hand.I milk one cow  
 called Maisy.                         
 We have also got chickens,ducks       
 and a jackdaw called Jack.Each member 
 of my family has a dog,mine is called 
 Nipper.My sister has a pony.We have   
 three neighbours and they are all     
 farmers.One of our neighbours has more
 than a hundred cows on his farm.He    
 milks them with the milking machine.We
 are all very friendly and visit each  
 other frequently.We help each other   
 out whenever we can.I enjoy living on 
 a farm.
