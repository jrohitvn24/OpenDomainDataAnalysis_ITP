		<content>{MACHINES}NOW CUT AND LOAD COAL ON TO  
 STEEL CONVEYORS. SOME MACHINES ARE AS 
 STRONG AS 500 HORSES AND SOME ARE     
 CONTROLLED BY COMPUTERS. THE MINER    
 DOESN'T HAVE TO DIG COAL OUT HE HAS TO
 BUILD UP THE MACHINES AND WATCH TO    
 MAKE SURE THEY OPERATE. GIRLS CANNOT  
 WORK DOWN A MINE AND MALES HAVE TO BE 
 16 YEARS OLD.                         
 COAL MINERS STILL GET DIRTY BUT NOW HE
 HAS A LOVELY HOT{SHOWER}AT THE PIT    
 HEAD BATHS AND GOES HOME AS CLEAN AS A
 SCHOOL TEACHER, EVEN HIS BACK!        
{I AM A SAFETY INSPECTOR.}I HAVE TO GET
 UP AT 3.30 A.M.TO GO DOWN THE PIT     
 BEFORE ALL THE WORKMEN AND MAKE SURE  
 THAT IT IS SAFE. AIR IS CIRCULATED    
 ROUND THE MINE USING A HUGE FAN. I    
 HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO GAS
 LEFT IN THE MINE.{METHANE GAS},WHICH  
 IS GIVEN OFF COAL, IS VERY DANGEROUS.
