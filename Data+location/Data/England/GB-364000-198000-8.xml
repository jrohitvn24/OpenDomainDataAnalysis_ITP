		<title>08THE RIVER SEVERN</title>
		<content> Although the area under study has only
 a small section of the{River Severn,  
 the{river's influence}on the Berkeley 
 Vale region cannot be ignored. It has 
 always been a major{commercial        
{waterway}supplying the needs of the   
 local community.                      
 Physically the{Severn Estuary}is      
 intersting for having the second      
 highest{tidal rise and fall}in the    
 world and for its frequent{bores}which
 attract tourists from all over the    
 world.                                
 Locally the river has a{navigable     
{channel}near to the Berkeley shore    
 with depths ranging from ankle deep   
 (0.05m) to 12m deep. The highest water
 marks occuring during the{Spring      
{tides.}The river water is used as a   
{coolant}in{Berkeley Power Station.}It 
 is also used as a{fishing}area.
