		<title>07     GREAT BARR HALL</title>
		<content> The most important{historical building
 in the area is{Great Barr Hall}which  
 is a grade 2 listed building.It was   
 owned for many years by members of the
 Scott family, who were originally     
 forced to move from Scotland to       
 England by Edward I for opposing him. 
 The most famous member of the family  
 was Sir Joseph Scott, who restored the
 Hall with his wife's Â£2,000 dowry, in 
 the eighteenth century. In 1795 he    
 asked the country's leading landscape 
 gardener{Humphry Repton}to re-design  
 the grounds. During the next four     
 years, thousands of trees were planted
 and two large lakes were dug. The Hall
 is now a shell but its Gothic front   
 and embattled walls  are still fine   
 examples of innovative architecture.  
 You can still see the lakes and trees 
 in the existing grounds of{St.        
{Margaret's Hospital.                  </content>
