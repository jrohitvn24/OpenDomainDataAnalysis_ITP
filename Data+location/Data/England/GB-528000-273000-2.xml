		<title>02Housing in N.St Ives.</title>
		<content> The houses in the  North of St.Ives   
  are all modern houses ,some recent   
 and some built up to ten years ago.The
 houses are recommended by their owners
  because of the peace and             
  quiet in spite of the occasional     
 plane coming over.                    
 Most of the new people who are        
 starting to settle in find that the   
 North of St.Ives public are very      
 friendly.They only move because they  
 need a job,or to get nearer to the    
 town.You'll mostly find that people   
 who have moved from one part of       
 St.Ives move to another part of       
 St.Ives.All of the houses are of brick
 construction.Some houses have a brick 
 structure instead of a wooden one.The 
 houses that are and were built from  a
 wooden frame have been known to be    
 fire risks.There are houses for       
 singles and married people in St.Ives.</content>
