		<content>{BRYNSWORTHY RESERVOIR. }Behind the    
 Brynsworthy Nurseries is a small      
 reservoir known as the Brysnworthy    
 Reservoir and is under the auspices of
 the South West Water Authority.       
 It is of course fenced off and        
 inaccessible, only being used as a    
 resource for the immediate area.      
                                       
{THE ABATTOIR. }Until a few months     
 ago, early in 1985, this Abattoir     
 was open to anyone wanting their      
 animals slaughtered for meat purposes.
 Now in July it is closed temporarily  
 to any use.   Animals for slaughter,  
 have to be taken to the Abattoir in   
 Torrington.   The workers who live in 
 the three modern bungalows in close   
 vicinity now work in the Torrington   
 meat factory travelling there each    
 day.
