		<content> The population in 1861  was 541. The  
 population in the 1981 census was only
 384. We think that the population has 
 decreased because there is now no work
 for the people. One of the Mills at   
 Shaw Mills closed down and the other  
 changed to a leather and suede curing 
 factory for many years but has        
 recently closed down altogether.      
 However the Council are asking the    
 Development Commision to allocate     
 funds for a craft workshop and housing
 scheme to be started in the old mill. 
 This will provide an opportunity for  
 craftsmen and women to work from home,
 boosting the local economy and        
 providing housing for local           
 people.Another reason for the decline 
 in the population is that the bus     
 service is very poor, only 2 buses a  
 day and 3 buses every Tuesday and     
 Thursday.                             </content>
