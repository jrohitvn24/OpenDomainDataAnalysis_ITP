		<title>04FARMING IN WITHYHAM/ST.JOHN</title>
		<content> On the outskirts of Crowborough       
 there are quite a few{Farms.}Most of  
 them have both{crops}and{livestock.   
 The crops they mostly grow are Wheat  
 and Barley but some vegetables are    
 grown. Some of the farmers have       
 cattle, sheep and horses some also    
 have poultry. Farmers near the        
 Ashdown Forest are allowed to let     
 their sheep graze on it. This has     
 been a right since the{Middle Ages.   
 There has been a Farm on the exact    
 sight of Friars Gate for 800 years.   
 It was called Grubs Farm. An old      
 lady who used to live there said it   
 was a farm with all sorts of animals  
 but now it is a riding school with a  
 few sheep and pigs, also poultry.     
 Gilridge Farm was a proper farm but   
 now it has fruit which is a pick      
 your own and it has a farm shop.X
