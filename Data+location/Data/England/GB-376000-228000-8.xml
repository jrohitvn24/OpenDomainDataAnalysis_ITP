		<content>  The main road passing through our    
 block is the A417 Gloucester to       
 Ledbury road. It is used by traffic   
 going from Gloucester to Hereford and 
 Malvern as well as by local people    
 going to work. We did a survey of     
 traffic on the main road on a Tuesday,
 from 11-11.30 a.m. and from 2-2.30    
 p.m. The following vehicles passed us:
 Morning: 50 cars, 19 lorries, 13 vans,
 1 bus and 2 bicycles.                 
 Afternoon: 69 cars, 9 lorries, 8 vans,
 2 buses and three bicyles.            
  The bus service is run by Swanbrook's
 and you can go to Gloucester,         
 Tewkesbury or Ledbury. Some buses stop
 at Compton's close near the old       
 people's homes but most stay on the   
 main road. The first bus to Gloucester
 leaves Staunton at 7.15 a.m. and the  
 last bus back leaves Gloucester at    
 6.15 p.m. The single fare is 45p.     </content>
