		<title>16A special day in my life.</title>
		<content> Yesterday July 3rd 1985 it was my     
 eleventh birthday.My mum called me to 
 get up.I went into her bedroom and got
 her up.Then I went excitedly down     
 stairs and brought my cards back up   
 and opened them.I counted up my       
 present money and it came to Â£6.85 but
 my mum gave me another 15p and the    
 total came to Â£7.00 precisely.I       
 dressed,had my breakfast of corn      
 flakes ,washed myself thoroughly and  
 brushed my hair.My mum also dressed   
 herself and we went up town going     
 into Woolworth's Department Store.We  
 had a look at some toys but my mum saw
 some swimming goggles which were 99p  
 so l bought them.That left me with    
 Â£6.01 exactly.I had a bun,and an ice  
 lolly,and a drink of pop as a         
 birthday treat.Then we set off for the
 video shop to choose a video called   
 "Lion Man."    By Christopher Barker. </content>
