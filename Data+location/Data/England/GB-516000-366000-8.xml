		<content>{MY SCHOOL - BY DAVID KIRK (age 10)    
                                       
 Our school is roughly 10 metres by 5  
 metres and has some 45 children in the
 whole school having 26 in the junior  
 class and 19 in the infant class which
 has recently had a facelift- knocking 
 down part of the wall and making that 
 part of the building an open  planned 
 classroom. I am in the fourth year    
 juniors which is the last year for    
 children going to the school at the   
 moment.  The starting age for the     
 youngest children is either 4 or 5    
 depending on the choice of the        
 parents.  The leaving age is always 10
 or 11 with the parents having no      
 choice in the affair whatsoever.  The 
 mathematics scheme is a very modern   
 scheme and has nice shiny educational 
 pictures in that make maths less      
 gloomy than it would be otherwise.    </content>
