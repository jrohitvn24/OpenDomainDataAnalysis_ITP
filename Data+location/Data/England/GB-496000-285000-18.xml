		<content>  Low_flying military aircraft from    
 R.A.F.Wittering and U.S.A.F.Alconbury 
 are often heard and seen in this      
 area.The most common planes are       
 Harriers, Phantoms and A_10's, the    
 'Tank_buster' aircraft. These cause   
 some disturbance but on the whole do  
 not appear to affect wild_life or     
 arable farming. In fact there are only
 six houses in the whole of this block 
 of the East Midlands, so the chances  
 of any civilian being injured are     
 remote.It is necessary for military   
 pilots to practice low_flying in the  
 1980's so that they can fly 'under the
 radar'. Rural areas with a low        
 population density are frequently used
 for this purpose, because there are   
 less people to be affected by the     
 noise. However, there are many pupils 
 at this school who do not agree!
