		<content>Chilldren working on this project all  
attend one of 6 local primary schools. 
The buildings and layout vary greatly. 
{Wyborne School} was built in 1881 and 
was originally called Pope Street      
School.                                
{Mottingham and Middle Park Schools}   
are  large brick buildings built in the
1930's.                                
{Horn Park} was built in 1949. The     
first permanent school opened in       
London after World War II. Newspapers  
called it "Super Modern" or "The       
Sunshine School".                      
{Redhill} was built in the 1950's and  
is a light airy low building in        
spacious  grounds.                     
Nevertheless when children write about 
their school day the time table and    
cirriculum sound very similar whatever 
the type of building.
