		<title>13  Place Names Around Barham.</title>
		<content>The names of the villages and hamlets  
in the survey area tell us something   
about what the land was like hundreds  
of years ago.Barham itself means       
Beora's settlement,and might indicate  
the prescence of bears in the area,    
since bears are shown on the village   
sign,and on the coat of arms of        
Reginald Fitzurse,Knight,who is linked 
with the murder of Thomas a Becket.    
Woolage Green refers to the heathland  
where wolves roam.Ropersole Farm       
refers to a pool frequented by rooks.  
Maydeken and Finnis Woods refer to     
the families which owned the area in   
the 14th century.Shelvin means         
dwellers on shelving ground,while      
Walderchain means a forest-dwellers'   
cavern.Within Barham,Brickfield Lane   
and Railway Hill tell us things about  
features of the village which are long 
gone.                                  </content>
