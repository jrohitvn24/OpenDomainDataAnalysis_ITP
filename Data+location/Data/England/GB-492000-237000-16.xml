		<content> The area is steeped in history. The   
 name Salford derived from the Saxon   
 Sealhford, meaning Willowford, became 
 Saleford and eventually Salford. It   
 is interesting to note that mention of
 an owner of the Manor of Salford was  
 Nigel de Salford a l2th century       
 benefactor.  A water mill is known to 
 have been at Salford in 1086 . A      
 disused water mill remains on the same
 site which fell into disuse in the    
 early 1960's. A school at Salford,    
 built in l867 which closed in 1952 is 
 now part of the Village Hall.  The    
 villages of Hulcote and Salford       
 benefit from three Charities, which   
 are now jointly administered.  The    
 Woodward Charity provides for a       
 payment of Â£5 to school leavers. The  
 Hervey Charity aids the poor and the  
 Town Sands Charity which is under     
 Church management.                    </content>
