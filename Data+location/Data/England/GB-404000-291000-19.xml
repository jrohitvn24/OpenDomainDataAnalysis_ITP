		<title>19LIVING IN GREAT BARR-Nicola</title>
		<content>My name is Nicola Shaw.I live at       
 Dyas Road in Great Barr.I like        
living here because the shops are      
good.I like the fish and chip shop     
because the chips are tasty and the    
food shop because the people are very  
pleasant.There is also a doctors about 
half a mile down the road.There is a   
lot of bus stops in Great Barr,so we   
can easily get to places.I also like   
living here because lots of my friends 
live here.There are things I do not    
like about living here,and they are:not
enough zebra crossings and not proper  
paving stones,which you cannot trip    
on.Most of the people here are nice,but
a few people make Great Barr a messy   
place by throwing litter.I like my     
school and the people who come         
here,but sometimes the school gets     
vandals,and it costs a lot of money to 
repair.                                </content>
