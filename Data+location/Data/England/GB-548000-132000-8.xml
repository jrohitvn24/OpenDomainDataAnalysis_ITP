		<title>08LOCAL NEWS IN WITHYHAM ST/J</title>
		<content> On 1st October 1985 the lovely        
{landscape}of our area was spoilt by an
 unusual event.  It was the hottest    
 October day on record, the{temperature
 reached into the eighties and         
 improvement work on the local{sewage  
 plant was in progress.  A combination 
 of the heat and sewage made a very    
 unpleasant smell in the neighbourhood 
 which did not go unnoticed by the     
{local}people.  They were, though, I am
 sure, prepared to put up with this,   
 because I am sure it is a great       
 improvement on 9oo years ago.  I have 
 just moved to Crowborough and live on 
 the north side pf the town so it is   
 interesting for me to go into our area
 on the map.
