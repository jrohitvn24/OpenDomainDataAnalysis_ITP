		<content>  There are 269 people living in the   
 area at present.There are 56 children 
 of school age and under.The children  
 that go to school go to Orton C of E  
 Primary school, which is situated in  
 the village, or to Kirkby Stephen     
 Grammar School which is 15 miles away.
 They are 46 retired people and 105    
 people who are working. People travel 
 to work by car, van or wagon.         
   A few people live in farm houses.   
 All the houses in the area are built  
 of stone with roughcast on them.There 
 are many more old houses than new     
 houses.The old houses have slate roofs
 but the new ones have tiles on        
 them.Almost all the houses have       
 gardens or a little yard.In the centre
 of the village the houses are built   
 very close together. This was done as 
 a form of self protection against the 
 Scottish border raiders.              </content>
