		<content>    In my free time I do all sorts of  
 things.  Sometimes I read or play with
 my friends, but at home I sometimes   
 watch television.  I may play with my 
 sister Kendra.  She is eight years    
 old.  We often play 'Downfall'        
 although she occasionally cheats.  I  
 then go out to play with my friends   
 and she feels wrong inside her.  KERRY

    I will never forget the day I went 
 on a fun-run.  This is a race which   
 you do for enjoyments sake, not just  
 to win.  My sister and her friend     
 went in fancy dress just for a joke.  
 They chose to go as punks.  A punk is 
 a person who has hair done in weird   
 colours - pink, green, blue, yellow   
 and many more.  Punks want to look    
 different from anyone else.  RACHEL
