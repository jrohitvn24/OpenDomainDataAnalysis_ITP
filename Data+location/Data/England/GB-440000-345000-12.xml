		<title>12LEISURE AROUND LOSCOE</title>
		<content> In Loscoe there is little leisure     
 provision and many of the residents   
 travel to  Heanor or Ripley.  Older   
 people tend to do more passive than   
 active pursuits. There are places     
 which we go to for leisure. Charles   
 Hill Hall is a small leisure centre   
 which is situated in the middle of    
 Loscoe. Here a number of activities   
 take place, garden parties, football  
 matches.Discos and rollerskating      
 sessions are arranged for the younger 
 generation in the main hall of the    
 sports centre. For middle aged people 
 there are quite a few pubs where they 
 have drinks and entertainment.        
 Old people enjoy the bingo which is   
 held at the Welfare. Some other places
 were they go to are the chapel or     
 church on Sundays to pray and sing and
 also to talk to their friends and to  
 get out of the house.                 </content>
