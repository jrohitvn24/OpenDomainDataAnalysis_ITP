		<content>These villages are relatively isolated 
and rely largely on the churches for   
recreational activities. The parish    
magazine which covers this area is     
called Â£The Link' and is published     
every month. With few other facilities,
this is an important means of keeping  
in touch with local affairs.           
Religion has long roots in the Astons. 
There are three stone crosses in the   
area. Lower Cross is at the junction of
Main Road and Blewbury Road, Coscte and
Upper Cross are near the Church but    
only the Upper Cross remains complete  
asthe others were smashed by the       
Puritans.
