		<title>03LITTLE WITLEY LIFE - CHURCH</title>
		<content>   We have no village school or shop.  
 As the ecclesiastical{parish }        
 (electoral roll 136) is now a united  
 benefice with Shrawley and Great      
 Witley, we are lucky still to have our
 own chapel, thanks in part to the     
 Friends of St. Michael formed in 1976.
   Our rector, Canon Barnish sadly     
 died earlier this year. As there is   
 only a joint Parochial Church Council,
 the Friends and the Chapel wardens    
 organize our{two services}a month,    
 including the family communion with   
 classes for the children, the annual  
 Harvest Supper and Christmas Carol    
 Service. "Gambling" plays an important
 part in fundraising to maintain the   
 churh fabric and churchyard; crazy    
 casino evenings are so well organized 
 and successful that the Friends are   
 asked to organize evenings for other  
 associations.                         </content>
