 Skew Bridge provides various          
 facilities.It is situated north of the
 Northampton Road and can be approached
 by a track going under the old railway
 line.It mainly deals with dry slope   
 skiing,water skiing and squash.There  
 is a club as well.To ski on the dry   
 slope you hire all the equipment you  
 need and go to the slopes.There       
 are two slopes,each using a rope      
 lift.There are skiing instructors to  
 help the beginner and the experienced 
 skier can go down the new slope.There 
 are chalets for the holiday-maker and 
 a big lake for all water-skiers with a
 ramp in it.It costs Â£92 for a year's  
 membership but you still have to pay  
 extra for some activities.
