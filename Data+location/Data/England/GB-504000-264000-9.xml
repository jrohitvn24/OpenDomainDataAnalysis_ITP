		<title>09Entertainment In Swineshead</title>
		<content> There are 2 fetes held in Swineshead, 
 one by the village hall and the other 
 by the church, both are used to raise 
 money for the respective places. They 
 prove to be successful and happy      
 events, though being run quite        
 differently.                          
 The Harvest Supper is held in the     
 Autumn when all the crops have been   
 gathered in. On the Sunday a          
 thanksgiving service is held in the   
 church. Then on the Monday the        
 villagers get together for a supper.  
 This is followed by an auction of all 
 the gifts of fruit, vegetables and    
 groceries. It is not as such a fund   
 raising event but a get together to   
 give thanks for a successful harvest. 
 Every year at Christman the children  
 are invited to a party in the village 
 hall, where they enjoy a tea, games   
 and a present from Father Christmas.  </content>
