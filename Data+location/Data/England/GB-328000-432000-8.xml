		<content> At half-past seven my alarm clock goes
 off.  I usually switch my television  
 on to make sure that the clock has not
 broken down, then I yawn and get up.  
 My usual breakfast is Alpen with a    
 glass of pure orange juice.  Then I   
 clean my teeth with my bear toothbrush
 and my face with my brother's         
 motor-bike flannel, then I get        
 dressed, wake my mum up (plus         
 brother), grab my bag, run down stairs
 and smell the fresh air of a new day. 
 The first thing that we do is read,   
 then the assembly bell goes unless the
 radio is going.  After that we usually
 do Maths followed by English then     
 Geography and History (History and    
 English are my favourite subjects).   
 Then if we are really lucky and do not
 talk in class, we will be doing P.E.  
 or Art (then with that the day's over 
 at school).                           </content>
