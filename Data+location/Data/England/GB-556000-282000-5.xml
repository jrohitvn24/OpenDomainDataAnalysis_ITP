		<content>{Mr.Rice}gave us the information       
 about the Baptist Chapel in the Main  
 Street. 'The Chapel was built on Oak  
 Piles but as the land has sunk there  
 is now a four foot drop under the     
 floor.As soon as the piles can be seen
 we will have to effect some renovation
 as the piles would rot in the air.    
 We have two services every Sunday. One
 at Eleven and one at Six-Thirty in the
 evening. In the winter the service is 
 changed to three forty-five so that   
 the elderly can get home before dark. 
 About eighteen come for the morning   
 service, less for the evening. We have
 a{part time Minister}that takes the   
 services, as he has other Chapels to  
 look after as well.                   
 There is a Mid-Week Prayer meeting    
 and a Sisterhood meeting twice a month
 on a Tuesday                          
 .                                     </content>
