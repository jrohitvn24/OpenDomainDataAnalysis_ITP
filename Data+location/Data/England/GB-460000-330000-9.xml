		<content> Keyworth goes back many hundreds of   
 years.The past has left us with many  
 historic places and buildings,such as 
 the Barn,church and some other houses 
 situated around the centre of Keyworth
 Take 1798 there was only 56 buildings 
 in Keyworth and only 7 streets.       
 Comparing that to today there is now  
 over 1000 houses and over 50 streets  
 Before enclosure in 1798 most people  
 in Keyworth used to own strips of land
 and were strip farmers some people    
 were frame work knitters and did other
 house jobs.But other people had strips
 and did other jobs such as the Rectors
 and the Lord of the Manor.They paid   
 other people to do their strips. Most 
 other people were too poor and had to 
 do the work themselves.In Keyworth on 
 Debdale Lane and Nottingham Road you  
 can see clear remains of the bumpy    
 ground used for farming.              </content>
