 There are 25 people who work at       
 Singholm, 3 which live in 14 part time
 and 8 full time.Most of the residents 
 come from South East England and the  
 most they can look after are 42 but at
 that time they were looking after 36  
 people.The home has been open about 30
 years before that it was a Singer     
 Sewing Machine Company and a troop    
 billet.Out of all the residents there 
 is only one man the rest are          
 women.The oldest person is 103 years  
 old and two people are coming up to   
 100 years old.                        
 POPLARS                               
 We asked the staff some questions

 had 4 full time and 27 part time      
 workers but nobody lived in. The home 
 has people from the Walton area       
 mostly.They can take 40 people when it</content>
