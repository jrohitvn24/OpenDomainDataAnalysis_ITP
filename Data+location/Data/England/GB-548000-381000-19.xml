		<title>19Sutton in 100 Years.</title>
		<content> I think that in 100 years Sutton will 
 be a very modern place to live. I     
 don't think our school will be here   
 as children will be taught at home on 
 a computer.I don't think there will be
 many shops,just a chemist where you   
 will get your dinner as it will just  
 be tablets in whatever flavour you    
 choose.I think Sutton will have weird 
 vehicles that will run on fresh air   
 and everyone will have their own      
 personal bomb.I think Sutton's main   
 attraction will still be the sea and  
 oil will still be drilled out of it   
 "Sutton on Sea" might not be the name 
 in a 100 years as it might be called  
 "Sutton with the Sea" or "Sutton near 
 the Sea".Sutton might have a massive  
 harbour and lots of different things  
 but even so I hope they don't spoil it
 because I like it as it is{-Sara
