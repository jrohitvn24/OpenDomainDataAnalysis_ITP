The Lostock hall Carnival started in   
1980. Its aim is to unite the community
raise money for local charities. When  
thing area was reorganised  it was     
thought to be a good time to re-start  
the August carnival after 25 years.  A 
committee was formed bylocal traders to
find ways of financing the carnival.   
Fund raising events are held and a     
carnial paper is distributed. On       
carnival day there are  street         
collections and site rental for stall  
ho.  After paying costs a profit of    
betw $1000 and $1200 is shared         
between local charities.  The lorries  
are  provided by local firms           
and are decorated by groups for the 2  
mile walk through the village. Entry is
free and open to all.  Individuals can 
enter the fancy dress secrion. The fair
isheld on the playing fields.          </content>
