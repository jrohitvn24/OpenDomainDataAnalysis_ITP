		<content>   Life centres around the home.       
 People have no organized entertainment
 and are reliant on their own          
 resources.                            
   Many homes in the area are still    
 without what other people consider    
 essential - mains water, sewerage,    
 electricity and gas - although most   
 have electricity.                     
   People are very friendly towards    
 each other and most of the inhabitants
 know everyone living here.  There is a
 good community spirit and anyone would
 help in trouble or emergencies.       
   There are no youth clubs and the    
 young people tend to make their own   
 entertainment in each other's homes.  
   We seem to follow the national trend
 with a high divorce rate and many     
 single-parent families.               
   Most families have pet dogs and/or  
 cats, etc.                            </content>
