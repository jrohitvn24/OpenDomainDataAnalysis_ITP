		<content>         {OLD HOUSES.                  
  Old houses around our area were      
 mainly built around the sixteenth     
 century.They originally comprised of  
 four rooms.The two downstairs were for
 cattle as the main income was farming.
 The upstairs rooms were for living and
 sleeping accomodation.                
  Up until the eighteent century all of
 these houses were thatched,butthe     
 thatching had to be replaced every    
 onehundred years because of           
 rotting.Thatching has now been        
 replaced by slate which is longer     
 lasting.                              
  These houses were built out of old   
 Guernsey Granite which is still used  
 to give modern houses the traditional 
 Guernsey finish.As Granite is so hard 
 most of the old Guernsey farmhouses   
 remaine intact and perfectly safe.    
  The majority of the houses nowerdays </content>
