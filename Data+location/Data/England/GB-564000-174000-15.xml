		<content> First we went to the{railway}near the 
{canal}and we heard birds making tunes,
 planes humming,a jeep, rustling       
 trees, guns firing and passing tains  
 and cars. We saw a jeep, a factory,   
 chimneys, smoke, train signals, a dead
 mouse, pylons,sheep, cows, a boy with 
 his bike, three trains and the bridge,
 crossing the disused canal. By the    
 canal we could see trees, a pond,     
 horses, grass, seeds, birds, wild     
 roses, a blackbird and a footpath. The
 flag of the{National Sea Training     
{College}was also visible. By the      
{Thames}we could see seagulls, a       
 donkey, a helicopter, a cargo ship,   
 stones, seaweed and driftwood. There  
 was a jetty, a rowing boat and rocks.
