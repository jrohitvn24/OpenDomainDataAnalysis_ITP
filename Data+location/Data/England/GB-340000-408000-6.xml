		<content> How has Ormskirk changed ?            
   The centre of the town used to have 
 roads running through it and the      
 market was there a long time before   
 the pedestrianised it. The population 
 and the size of the town has grown but
 the College has been here for as long 
 as I can remember.                    
   There used to be a few cinemas and  
 more car parks have now been built    
 because the town is much busier than  
 it used to be.                        
    There was no hospital when I first 
 came to the town but that was a long  
 time ago.                             
 What has stayed the same ?            
    The churches have stayed the same  
 and the market and the clock tower    
 have not really altered at all.
