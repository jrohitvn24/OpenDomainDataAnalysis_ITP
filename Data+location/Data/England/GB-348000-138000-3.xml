		<content>{Modern technology}has meant that there
 have been{redundancies}in all areas of
 employment.                           
 Many farms have become more mechanised
 and recent{EEC}dairy quotas have meant
 that local farmers have had to reduce 
 the size of their herds.              
 Several retail businesses in the town 
 have closed in the recent past and    
 empty shop premises are becoming all  
 too commonplace in the High Street.   
 Many of the workforce found regular   
 employment hitherto in the{boot and   
{shoe industry}based in the neighbour- 
 town of Street.                       
 Two of the town's major employers have
 been forced to close through financial
 difficulties.  Others have cut their  
 workforce in an attempt to survive.   
 Many people are forced to travel      
 considerable distances each day to    
 their place of employment.            </content>
