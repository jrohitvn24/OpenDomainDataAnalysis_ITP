		<content> Miss Leckenby who lives at Forge      
 Cottage says that gardening has always
 been popular in Bilsdale. People like 
 it because it is a good hobby to do in
 their spare time.On average people    
 grow the same amount of vegetables as 
 they do flowers.Roses have many more  
 varieties now ,they used to be only   
 red and white.Miss Leckenby likes the 
 old fashioned flowers but she also    
 likes the new hybrid varieties which  
 are bigger and have better colours.   
 Dahlias and Begonias are difficult to 
 grow due to the late frosts and the   
 high winds.Garden centres which are a 
 recent arrival give gardeners agood   
 idea about  habits of flowers and     
 whether they will suit their garden.  
 People here love daffodils and        
 snowdrops but Miss Leckenby really    
 loves sweet peas and chrysanthemums.
