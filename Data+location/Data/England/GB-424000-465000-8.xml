 Lacon Hall was probably built at the  
 same time as Fountains Abbey in 1132. 
 Recently when they were turning it    
 into holiday flats they found timber  
 framing,an inglenook fireplace and    
 solid oak beams.The beams are so hard,
 it is almost impossible to drive a    
 nail into them.Evidence shows that it 
 was thatched many years ago.Fifty     
 years ago it was a farm.There were 14 
 or 15 milk cows,60 sheep and 2 large  
 cart hores.A pack horse track from    
 Fountains Abbey leads through the yard
 and on to Nidderdale.After they got   
 rid of the shire horses,the family    
 said they could still hear them       
 kicking against the wall in the stable
 at night.
