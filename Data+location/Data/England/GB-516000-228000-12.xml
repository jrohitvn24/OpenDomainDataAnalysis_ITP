		<title>12OUGHTONHEAD COMMON, HITCHIN</title>
		<content>   Oughtonhead Common is situated      
 about two miles North west of Hitchin 
 town centre. The  area is             
 approximately 42 acres. The land cover
 is a mixture of woodland, marsh and   
 rough grazing. It is surrounded by    
 farmland.                             
   The Common is of huge importance to 
 local residents for recreational      
 activities. A published Nature Trail  
 is available. There is some unofficial
 camping on the Common. Part of the    
 Common has been designated a          
 conservation Area and steps have been 
 taken to protect it and encourage wild
 life. It includes a large area of     
 marsh. It is hoped to re-introduce    
 cattle to graze here.
