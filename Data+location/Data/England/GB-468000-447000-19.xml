		<title>19The Legend of Giant's Hill.</title>
		<content>{The Story of a Tunnel.                
    In the middle of Sutton wood there 
 is a mound which is very ancient but  
 is definitely man-made. The mound is  
 called Giant's Hill, it is quite big. 
    There is a legend which says a     
 tunnel leads from Giant's Hill to the 
 Old Rectory in Sutton-on-Derwent      
 village.Nobody today knows who is     
 supposed to have made the tunnel or   
 indeed why it was made.               
     Some people think it was an escape
 route for priests,others that it was  
 made by thieves to steal from the     
 Rectory.There may have been a         
 building,such as a castle or manor    
 house on the mound and the tunnel may 
 have been a secret exit.              
     As all that remains is the mound  
 and the story of the tunnel nobody    
 really knows.
