		<content> The church was built in 1933 and the  
 Family Centre was opened in 1979.     
 During the Second World War many of   
 the houses around the church were     
 bombed and fewer people went to the   
 church.Factories were built in the    
 streets all around.The Family Centre  
 is in part of the church no longer    
 needed,new buildings have been        
 added.In the Centre there are         
 activities for all ages from a        
 playgroup to youth clubs,pensioners   
 lunch clubs and a day centre for the  
 elderly. It is open Monday to Saturday
 and there are 18 paid workers and 25  
 volunteers.
