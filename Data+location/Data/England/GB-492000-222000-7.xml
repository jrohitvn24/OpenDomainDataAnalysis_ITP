		<title>07R.A.F. STANBRIDGE</title>
		<content>  The R.A.F. base is situated on       
 Stanbridge Road at the South East end 
 of Leighton Buzzard. It was opened as 
 a communication base. During the      
 Second World War it was a  major base 
 for secret communication traffic.     
 During this time it was greatly       
 extended and many underground passages
 were built and filled with modern     
 equipment. The equipment has become   
 out moded. This has caused the present
 run-down of the base with only a few  
 personel and key workers left. Much of
 the R.A.F. housing lies empty. The    
 future of the base is at present very 
 uncertain. Many plans have been       
 discussed including use of the base as
 a transit camp or closing the base    
 completely. No decision has yet been  
 taken.
