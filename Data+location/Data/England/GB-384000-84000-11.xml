		<title>11A Pensioner's Day</title>
		<content> I arose at 8.0 a.m,had breakfast,did  
 necessary household tasks in the flat,
 then I got ready to go out.           
 A friend called to take me by car to a
 meeting of the W.I. Market Committee. 
 This was timed to start at 9.30.a.m.  
 and, as Chairman,I aimed for it to    
 finish by 12 noon.I got home at about 
 12.30 for a quick lunch which had been
 prepared beforehand.                  
 Out again by 1.30 to get the coach for
 an afternoon's mystery tour.It was a  
 lovely May afternoon and we went      
 around the New Forest,stopping at     
 Lyndhurst for afternoon tea.          
 Back in the coach again,we called at  
 the Sir Winston Churchill hostelry for
 a drink before going on to Wareham to 
 get some fish and chips. Home by      
 9.0.p.m.                              
 Watched television,made supper and    
 then ..so to bed.                     </content>
