		<title>09Warmington Village #1</title>
		<content> The Village lies on the North East    
 slope of the valley and is a splendid 
 example of an "Old English Village".  
 As conservation control here is very  
 strict,there have been less than 20   
 houses built over the past 20 years.A 
 new group of 8 houses have been       
 carefully fitted into the background, 
 in a similar style to those adjacent. 
 The layout and unspoilt beaty,with the
 golden mellowness of the local Hornton
 stone,is muh admired by visitors.     
 Many American tourists visit each     
 year,from Hotels in nearby Stratford  
 upon Avon,being "bussed in" for the   
 evening to relish the atmosphere and  
 visit the local Pub"{The Plough".}    
 The Village is built around a large   
 triangular Green which is centered by 
 a large Duck pond filled with water   
 lilies and a good family of Ducks.The 
 17th Century{Manor House}dominates it.</content>
