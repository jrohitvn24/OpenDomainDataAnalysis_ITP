		<title>03Games We Play.</title>
		<content> There are lots of{games}that are very 
{old,}and children still play them now,
 but with{new}names.  We like to play  
{Bulldogs, Stag, Bottle of Poison,Stuck
{-in-the-Mud,}which are all games that 
 our teacher used to play, but with    
 different names.  We usually play     
 these games in the{playground}or on   
 the school field, because lots of     
 children join in and they involve     
 running and catching people.  I like  
 Bulldogs because you can have a rest  
 at one side when you are tired. I also
 like dodging people.                  
   On the{field}we play{cricket,       
{rounders and football.}My favourite   
 game is football because you are      
 always on the move, with or without   
 the ball.                             
   At{home}I play on my{bike.}If it is 
 raining I play{darts, snooker or pool,
 or play on my friend's{computer.      </content>
