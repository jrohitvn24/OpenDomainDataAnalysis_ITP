		<content>   Northleach has never had a railway  
 line, although years ago there was a  
 line to Bourton. The nearest railway  
 stations are Cheltenham and Kingham.  
 Four bus companies run regular        
 services in the area_Perrets, National
 Pulhams and Marchants. There is a     
 reasonable service to Cheltenham and  
 Oxford and a limited service to       
 Cirencester and Bourton. There is 1   
 bus to Hampnet on a Wednesday.        
   The number of buses passing through 
 Northleach on any 1 day is as         
 follows:_ Monday _30;  Tuesday _30;   
 Wednesday _19;  Thursday _41;  Friday 
 _52;  Saturday _28;  Saturday _28;    
 Sunday _23!                           
   There is 1 taxi service. According  
 to the children who walked them, the  
 public footpaths are awful! Many      
 people who live in Northleach drive to
 work in Chelt., Oxford, Glos. etc.    </content>
