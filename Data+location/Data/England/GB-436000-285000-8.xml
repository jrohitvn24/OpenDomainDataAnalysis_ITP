		<content> The area is densely populated and the 
 nature of houses is greatly varied.A  
 high proportion of the dwelling places
 are council owned and are of the      
 following types: detatched, semi,     
 terraced, bungalows, town houses and a
 blocks of flats.Many houses           
 along Bulkington Road area are of an  
 older variety and some date back to   
 the turn of the century.Behind these  
 and in the centre of the area are     
 newer post second world war.The small 
 semi detatched bungalows and the flats
 have been recently built and most are 
 occupied by old people.One small      
 section on York Ave. comprises purpose
 built bungalows for elderly people and
 a warden and deputy warden look after 
 their welfare.The atmosphere on the   
 estate is quiet and peaceful and near 
 the homes for elderly people are      
 flower beds,grass and benches.        </content>
