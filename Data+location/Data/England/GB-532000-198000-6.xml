		<content>       OUR SCHOOL CARETAKER            
                                       
  Our caretaker has been a caretaker   
 for 20 years and has lived in the     
 school house for 16 years. His house  
 has been here 26 years. Sometimes he  
 works from 6am-10pm. He enjoys his job
 and says it can be hard work sometimes
  The boiler room is run by gas and is 
 computerised. Above the room is a tall
 chimney. The hardest job he has to do 
 is clean the three boilers which takes
 2-3 hours. The easiest job he has to  
 do is collect the post. His wife helps
 him clean the school. He likes helping
 on sports day. Other jobs our         
 caretaker has to do are change a light
 bulb, look after the pumps and the    
 water tanks. He has 5 weeks holiday a 
 year and gets an average caretakers   
 wage.
