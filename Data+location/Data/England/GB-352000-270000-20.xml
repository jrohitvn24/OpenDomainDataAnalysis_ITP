		<title>20River Teme,Ashford Carbonell</title>
		<content> The River Teme runs to the west of the
 village of Ashford Carbonell in a     
 southerly direction.Immediately after 
 running under Ashford  Bridge the     
 river drops down a weir and near here 
 is an old mill which originally used  
 the river as a power source to        
 generate electricity for Ashford      
 Court.The mill is still in working    
 order but no longer used.Canoeists use
 this part of the river and an annual  
 Teme Raft Race passes through Ashford 
 Carbonell on route from Bromfield to  
 Little Hereford.At Temes Green the    
 river makes a wide,sweeping bend and  
 fishing is allowed here for residents 
 of the village.
