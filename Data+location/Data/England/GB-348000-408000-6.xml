		<title>06Description of Dalton</title>
		<content>         We went round Dalton which is 
 a small rural village of about 200    
 people. There is a large house called 
 Dalton Grange with lots of fancy      
 windows and a boat in the garden. The 
 other houses were very well looked    
 after.                                
         There is only one telephone   
 box and one post box and for shopping 
 people have to go to Asda and other   
 large stores as there are no shops in 
 Dalton.                               
         There is a village school     
 which has about 60 children and two   
 members of staff.                     
         The majority of Dalton is used
 for farming or grazing; there is not  
 much housing development.             
         It is quiet and peaceful and  
 people liked living there.            
                                       
                                       </content>
