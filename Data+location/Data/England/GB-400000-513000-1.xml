		<content>  This area on the eastern foothills   
 of the Pennine Chain lies midway      
 between the River Tees and the River  
 Greta.Formerly in the North Riding of 
 Yorkshire,it became in 1974 part of   
 the{District of Teesdale}in the{County
{of Durham.}                           
  With the exception of Boldron Village
 which contains church,chapel,village  
 hall and public house,it is a sparsely
 populated area largely taken up by a  
 number of small farms and a few acres 
 of derelict land.                     
  Apart from a brick works,a family    
 plant-hire firm and a small quarry,the
 area contains no industry.The improved
 A66 trunk road runs through the area, 
 but,otherwise,the abandoned railway   
 cutting,the small,redundant reservoir 
 and numerous disused quarries paint a 
 rather sad picture of what used to be.
