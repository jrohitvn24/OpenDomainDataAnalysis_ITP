		<content> The Population is 280, contained in   
 about 50 households. Of these approx- 
 imately 20% are children of school age
 33% are retired. All the people are   
 white.                                
 These consist of local farm workers in
 tied cottages, a few indigenous people
 remain but mostly a migrant middle    
 class, and small upper middle class,- 
 comprising senior retired members of  
 the Armed Forces, titled/decorated    
 individuals and Landowners.           
 The people are largely conservative in
 outlook. There has been an upsurge of 
 interest in Local Government. A close 
 knit community, albeit along class    
 lines, who work together for the      
 interest of the village.
