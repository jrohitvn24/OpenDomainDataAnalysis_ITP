		<title>03SURVEY RESULTS</title>
		<content> It has been recorded that in 1856     
 there were 448 people living in the   
 area which covered 3650 acres. These  
 included a wheelwright,a tailor,a     
 lock-keeper,a joiner,a shopkeeper, a  
 boot and shoemaker, 2 publicans and 2 
 farmers.                              
     Our group devised a survey which  
 we delivered to the whole village of  
 North Kyme.We did not get all of them 
 back but we were able to use some of  
 the information.We saw that the       
 population had not changed greatly but
 that jobs varied greatly.There are now
 several farmers as well as farm       
 labourers. Several people are involved
 in haulage work and the majority of   
 people work locally. We also found    
 that most people owned their houses   
 and all those that owned a car also   
 had a garage.Most of the crafts       
 mentioned above no longer exist.      </content>
