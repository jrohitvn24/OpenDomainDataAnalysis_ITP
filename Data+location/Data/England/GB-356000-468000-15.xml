		<content> Agriculture plays an important role in
the life of the Lune Valley. There are 
many farms situated along the valley   
and within our own area of study there 
are 15 farms. They are usually between 
100-200 acres (40-80 hectares) in area.
Dairy farming is the main form of      
agriculure although there is a growing 
influence in sheep and beef farming.   
This is due to recent EEC Agricultural 
policy which has led to a cut back in  
the size of dairy herds by as much as  
10%                                    
There are fewer farms in the area than 
there were 25 years ago. This is due to
the merging of some farms and the      
selling of some land for residential   
development. The climate of the area is
such that there is about 30 cm of      
rainfall per annum above the optimum   
for arable farming to take place. The  
only crop grown is silage.             </content>
