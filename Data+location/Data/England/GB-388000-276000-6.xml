		<content> There are a few sources of            
 entertainment. One is Theatre 282, an 
{amateur dramatic society,}which       
 performs three times a year and gives 
 opportunities to act or spectate.     
 During the winter months, the young   
 population can attend{discos,}which   
 are dances where recorded popular     
 music is played. They are held at the 
 Parish Room which can also be hired   
 out for a nominal charge. Public or   
 private functions take place including
 Women's Institute, wedding receptons  
 and various fund raising activities.  
 The{Annual Fete,}which is held in     
 September, is the main event of the   
 year. Usually the whole village       
 attends and the proceeds are divided  
 between worthy organisations within   
 the village.
