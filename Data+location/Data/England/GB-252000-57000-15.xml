		<title>15     RIVER PLYM LIFE</title>
		<content>   If you explore the shallow area of  
 The River Plym you will mostly find a 
 rather small insect called the        
 pondskater.The pondskater is a        
 carnivore and acts as a bully as it   
 only eats smaller creatures.As weeds  
 grow in the river so will the snail   
 population.The water snail is a       
 vegetarian and only eats weed.        
   A little deeper the water boatman   
 appears.This creature is also a       
 carnivore and eats mostly pondskaters.
 Below the surface,water scorpions wait
 to seize smaller river creatures.     
   As the river gets deeper,the river  
 flows faster.These conditions are     
 perfect for elvers ,fish and toads.   
 Elvers and trout often use these      
 conditions to swim faster and escape  
 from their enemies.                   
   Toads lurk under stones and come out
 for food at night.                    </content>
