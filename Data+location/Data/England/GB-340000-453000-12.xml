		<content> There are two tides a day.  Westerly  
 winds combined with high tides can    
 cause flooding, usually between       
 October and March.  There have been   
 two such storms in l977 and l983.  On 
 llth November l977, the land was      
 flooded to Briggs Brow, Thurnham, when
 the river banks burst at Janson's Pool
 and Bank End.  Crook Farm had three   
 windows shattered in spite of         
 shutters; Clarksons Farm was flooded  
 but there was no loss of life.  On lst
 February l983, a tunnel under         
 Cockersand Abbey was exposed when the 
 tide burst the sea wall.  It was      
 identified as a sewer.
