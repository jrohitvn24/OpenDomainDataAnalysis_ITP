		<title>03Mixed Farming - Henwood</title>
		<content>      Bradley's  farm,  owned by Merton
 College, consists of over 300 acres of
 grassland  and  winter planted barley,
 which yields 2.94 tons per acre. Grain
 grown   for   fodder  is  not  sprayed
 extensively to eradicate weeds as wild
 oats  in  the barley can be tolerated.
 Grain  sold  to merchants must be free
 from weed seed.  In the last two years
 the  grain  price has fallen from Â£108
 to Â£94.50per ton.                     
      The  farm  is  run by the farmer,
 his  two  sons and one labourer.  They
 breed dairy cows,  keep a milking herd
 of 120 cows and fatten for beef.  Cows
 are milked at 5.30am and in the after-
 noon.   The  new  milking  parlour  is
{computerized;}  when  the  milk  stops
 flowing from the udder the pressure in
 the  cups  is  released  and  they are
 sucked  off the teats.  Last year each
 cow averaged 7000litres of milk.      </content>
