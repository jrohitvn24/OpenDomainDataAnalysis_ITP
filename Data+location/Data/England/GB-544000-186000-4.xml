		<content>{Railways in South East Ilford:        
 The railway line between Ilford and   
 Romford, forming part of B.R.'s       
 Eastern Region, has changed much      
 during the last twenty years.         
{Goodmayes Station's}marshalling yard  
 and coal depot has disappeared, the   
 land being used today by a large DIY  
 store, a freight depot and a school   
 playing field.                        
 Both the{suburban}and{main lines}are  
 electrified and trains carry anything 
 from car bodies to commuters and from 
 tourists to nucear waste through the  
 area.                                 
{Fast passenger services}operate       
 between Liverpool Street and the towns
 and resorts of East Anglia.           
 Electrification and new rolling stock 
 give a modern image allowing commuters
 to reach central London in less than  
 half an hour.     MAYFIELD HIGH SCHOOL</content>
