		<content> In{1086 the manor of Deerhurst}was    
 owned by St. Peter's Church of        
 Westminster &amp; comprised 59 hides.     
 Some 34 people lived in the hundred.  
 The Saxon church still attracts       
 visiters to the area but symbolically 
 the priory has been converted to farm 
 buildings and the school has moved    
 from Deerhurst to{Apperley}which is a 
 village experiencing rapid residential
 growth.  In the{1981 census}763 people
 lived in the parish and of 272        
 dwellings 65% were owner-occupied.    
 Unemployment was only 3.8%.           
 Significantly 86% of the households   
 own one or more cars.  It is thus an  
 area split in two: physically by the  
 River Severn and culturally by the    
 influx of residents who regard the    
 area as a rural dormitory.  This area 
 can only be studied as it relates to  
 neighbouring towns.                   </content>
