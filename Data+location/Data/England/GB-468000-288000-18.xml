		<title>18HOBBIES OF B.J.PADLEY</title>
		<content> My mum has a strange hobby,she        
 collects dolls and shop dummies.She   
 has roughly 30 old dolls and a lot of 
 modern dolls.                         
 My dad and mum share a hobby,dad takes
 photos of peoples pets and mum then   
 does a painting in watercolour and    
 chalk which the people buy.           
 She does a lot of sewing and knitting 
 which is good cause if I want any     
 different clothes she makes them for  
 me.Iam wearing a T shirt and trousers 
 that she made.                        
 She also makes clothes for other      
 people as she is a tailoress,but that 
 is still a hobby she says as she      
 doesn't do it all the time.           
 She leads a busy life as she also runs
 our house and keeps it clean and tidy.
 She cooks and cleans every day,while  
 I'm at school or out playing.
