		<content>   THE FARM IS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE 
COAST ROAD IN THE VILLAGE OF BREAN.    
   THE LAND HERE IS VERY FLAT AND IS   
PROTECTED FROM THE PREVAILING WINDS    
ONLY BY THE COASTAL SAND DUNES.THE SOIL
IS SUITABLE ONLY FOR PASTURE AND A HERD
OF FRIESIAN CATTLE PRODUCES MILK FOR   
THE LOCAL DAIRY AND ANIMALS FOR        
SLOUGHTER.                             
   IN COMMON WITH MOST FORMS IN THIS   
AREA,A STRIP OF LAND HAS BEEN SET ASIDE
FOR USE BY CARAVANS.THESE ARE MOSTLY   
STATIC VANS.APART FROM TOILET BLOCKS   
AND WATER SUPPLIES,THERE IS NO         
PROVISION FOR THE HOLIDAY TAKEN,I.E.   
THERE IS A CARAVAN WHERE ONE CAN       
EAT,SLEEP AND REST BUT ENTERTAINMENT   
HAS TO BE SOUGHT ESLE WHERE.           
   THE FARMHOUSE IS VERY OLD AND       
FARMING HAS BEEN CARRIED ON HERE FOR   
CENTURIES.
