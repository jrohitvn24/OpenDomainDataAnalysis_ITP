		<title>08A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> At 7.30am I woke up.For breakfast I   
 had cereal.I watched T.V.Then made my 
 bed.I wear a summer uniform,it is a   
 blue checked dress,white belt and blue
 cardigan.I walked to school.It took me
 5 minutes.I met my friend and we      
 talked untill the whistle went.Our    
 teacher took the register then we went
 into assembly.We did geography untill 
 play time.It was about map reading.At 
 play time I ate a chocolate bar.I     
 played handstands and cartwheels with 
 my friends.When we came in from play  
 we had to carry on with our projects. 
 My project was about girls in Saxon   
 times.We did  that till lunch time.I  
 went home for lunch.When I arrived    
 back at school I talked to my         
 friend.The whistle went and we were   
 sent in.We got changed for sports.We  
 went out onto the field.We had to run 
 once round the field. {               </content>
