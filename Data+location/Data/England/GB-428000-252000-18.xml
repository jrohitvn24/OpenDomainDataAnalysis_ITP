		<content>    These are our favourite games in   
 order of popularity.                  
 1) To play{stag}you wait till someone 
 shouts and then everybody has to run  
 into the semicircle.The last one in   
 the semicircle is on and calls        
 somebodys name. The person called has 
 to try to get past the person who is  
 on. If he does it, all the other      
 children try to get past.             
 2) One of the group has to throw the  
 ball behind them. If you catch it you 
 have to say cabbage and if you do not 
 catch it you have to say{Queenio,     
{queenio who's got the ballio,}and the 
 person has to guess who has the ball. 
 3) To play{tig on the lines}the last  
 one on the yellow netball court lines 
 is on.Everyone has to run along the   
 lines. The one who is on has to try   
 and tig someone. When he has tigged   
 everyone you start all over again.    </content>
