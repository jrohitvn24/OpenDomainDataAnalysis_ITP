		<title>09THE TOWN OF KIRTON LINDSEY</title>
		<content>  To the visitor or newcomer {Kirton   
{Lindsey }gives the impression of a    
 maze. Its narrow streets follow little
 pattern and the recent introduction of
 a one-way system for vehicles         
 accentuates the problems for          
 motorists.                            
                                       
  The town appears to have two centres.
 The commercial centre is around the   
 Market Place, where the architecture  
 and non-local building materials of   
 the Town Hall reflect the town's      
 former importance. The other centre is
 less commercial and is centered on {  
{St. Andrew's Church.}The area between 
 the two centres has been filled with  
 more recent housing.                  
                                       
   The town's past is also reflected by
 the now defunct{Jail, and Courthouse.
