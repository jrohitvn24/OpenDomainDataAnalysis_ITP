		<title>13  Visit to Vobster church.</title>
		<content>       On Thursday July the 4th I went 
 to St. Edmund's church.   I went with 
 six other boys.  When we got there the
 vicar was waiting for us. We all said 
 hello. He said," First of all we can  
 all sit down on the grass and I will  
 tell you about little odd things."    
      The first thing he told us was   
 about St.Edmund. St.Edmund was tied to
 a tree and had arrows shot at him.    
 Then they cut off his head to say that
 he was really dead.                   
       Then we all went into the church
 to have a look around. We went into   
 a little room and we saw an old rusty 
 safe.Then we looked around a bit more 
 and we found the key to the safe. We  
 saw a big eagle and it was very       
 beautiful indeed. Then we did some    
 drawings.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
