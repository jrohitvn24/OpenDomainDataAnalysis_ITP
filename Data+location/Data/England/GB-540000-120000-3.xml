		<title>03FOCAL POINTS OF NEWICK</title>
		<content> The village has two main focal points,
 one, the Village Green and the other, 
 the Church, set away from the shops   
 and houses.                           
   The Green is crossed by the A272 and
 has always had a sprinkling of shops  
 and businesses around it. There was   
 once a pond and the pump was erected  
 in 1897 to provide drinking water for 
 the villagers.                        
   The Church, dating from Norman      
 times, is sited where two Pilgrim     
 path crossed, one E-W between the     
 cathedral cities of Canterbury and    
 Winchester, and the other N-S down to 
 Lewes.                                
   Three other very lively centres     
 which need a mention are the inns, the
 Bull, the Royal Oak and the Crown.
