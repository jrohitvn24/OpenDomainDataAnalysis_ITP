		<title>18Ghost Stories</title>
		<content> Where I live on the Old Coach road    
 there is something{supernatural.}It is
 said that there is a{ghost.}The story 
 is that every Saturday night the ghost
 of a horseman rides furiously up and  
 down the lane because his girlfriend  
 died in a{stagecoach}long ago. The    
 horseman was riding after the         
 stagecoach to stop it, when it turned 
 over and everyone inside was killed.  
 The Redcoats saw what had happened and
 shot the horseman dead in the middle  
 of the lane. The lane is long and     
 winding, dusty and bumpy, and very    
 spookey.The house where I live is very
 old and it is also supposed to be{    
{haunted.}
