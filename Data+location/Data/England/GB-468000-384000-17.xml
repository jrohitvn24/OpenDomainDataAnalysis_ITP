		<content> The soil is good but it dries out     
 quickly.  Some of the cows to go the  
 butchers but most go to the market.   
 They go to market when they have had  
 their fifth calf.  Mr. Kent buys his  
 machinery from Tuxford, Newark and    
 Doncaster.  His sugar beet goes to the
 sugar beet factory, and corn goes     
 to                                    
 Worksop.  Every year they get 682,857 
 gallons of milk from the cows.  Some  
 surplus milk goes to feed the pigs.   
 Mr. Kent bales all the straw from the 
 barley.
