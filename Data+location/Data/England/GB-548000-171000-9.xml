		<title>09Shops in Bexley Village</title>
		<content>   The highest concentration of traders
 is situated in Bexley High Street,    
 with only two other smaller shopping  
 parades within the block. There are   
 approximately 75 retail businesses,   
 operating from shop premises including
 banks, estate agents, clothes &amp; food  
 shops.                                
   These shops attract mainly local    
 trade as a large shopping centre is at
 Bexleyheath. The fresh food shops     
 provide local shoppers with their     
 everyday requirements.                
   People from outside the local area  
 are attracted by the many retuarants &amp;
 pubs and a few specialist shops such  
 photographers, high class antiques and
 a stamp centre. Most shops open       
 between 9.00am &amp; 5.30pm six days a    
 week, while a few still close for     
 lunch and have a half day closing on  
 Thursday. There are no street traders.</content>
