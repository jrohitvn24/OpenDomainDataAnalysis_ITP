		<title>07SKELMANTHORPE SCREENS</title>
		<content> Skelmanthorpe Screens is a small part 
 of Emley Moor Colliery. The coal is   
 sent from Emley Moor to Skelmanthorpe 
 by conveyor belt and at Skelmanthorpe 
 coal is washed, sorted out into grades
 and then bagged. I decided to         
 interview Mr. D. and Mr A. Jones. They
 told me about their jobs and things   
 that other people have to do, eg:     
 working on the face, office work      
 and actually working down the pit. At 
 Emley Moor the men that work down the 
 pit have to lie on their sides, and,  
 using a pickaxe,they pick the coal    
 out. Although Skelmanthorpe Screens is
 due to close in the near future, some 
 men who work there are trying to buy  
 the pit and Skelmanthorpe Screens from
 the N C B (National Coal Board) to run
 privately.
