		<title>17Pilgrims' Way &amp; St.Martha's</title>
		<content> It is not known for certain that      
 pilgrims walked along this path but it
 is still called the Pilgrims' Way.    
 It was an important communications    
 route from iron age times. The line of
 the Pilgrims' Way may be easily       
 followed along the banks of the River 
 Wey, up onto the downs, through the   
 Chantry woods and straight on to St.  
 Martha's Church.                      
                                       
 The church was built between 1100     
 and 1170. It took a long time to build
 because chalk had to be brought from  
 Newland's Corner. Water for the       
 building materials also had to be     
 transported uphill because there are  
 no streams on the downs. Many pilgrims
 visited the church en route to        
 Canterbury.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
