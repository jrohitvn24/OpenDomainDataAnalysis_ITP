  The Rebow family, merchants,         
Recorders and M Ps of Wivenhoe Hall and
Colchester bought the Hall and         
traditionally felled the oaks. They may
also have caused part of the hall to   
have been pulled down. However, they   
did not live there. For 200 years they 
had tenants who were more concerned    
with farming than maintaining the large
building.                              
  Just before the Great war it was sold
to Mr Arthur Sherston who repaired and 
restored it. The Hall became the centre
of village fetes and festivities in the
peaceful 20s and 30s. Since 1950 Sir   
Peter Foster, the McAlpines and now, Mr
John Mosesson have owned and cared for 
the Hall. Today it is open to the      
public and is a truly marvellous local 
landmark.
