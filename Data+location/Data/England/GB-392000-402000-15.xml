		<title>15Whit Friday Band contest</title>
		<content>    Every year on Whit Friday In the   
 village of Saddleworth there is a Band
 Contest.There are a lot of bands      
 walking round the area.               
   Almost everybody comes out to watch 
 and listen.Some look out of the window
 to watch.                             
   There were lots of people in the    
 contest. There was a big crowd when   
 the bands were playing. There were 58 
 bands entered but some of them didnt  
 arrive so it finished at ten O'clock  
 instead of midnight.                  
   When one of the bands marched onto  
 the ground,lots of people cheered.I   
 think the best band was the Post      
 Office Engineering  brass band.       
   the band contest has been running   
 for eight years.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
