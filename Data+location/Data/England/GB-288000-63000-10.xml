		<content>    At 10am I check the barrels by     
 turning the pump on and pulling beer  
 into the bucket. Then I bottle up.    
 This means restocking the shelves in  
 the bar with bottles from the cellar. 
 Their tops have to be wiped with a    
 damp cloth.                           
    My wife counts up. This means      
 checking all the money from the night 
 before.                               
    We open at 11am to serve the early 
 customers and close at 2.30pm. In the 
 evening we are open from 5.30 until   
 11pm.                                 
     I enjoy the work because it us    
 nice meeting and talking to people.   
    Funnily enough we are usually      
 busier in the winter than in the      
 summer because we are not near the    
 tourist attractions and in the summer 
 the holiday makers go to the pubs near
 the sea front.                        </content>
