		<title>04A FARM IN COTTINGLEY</title>
		<content> The date is the 7th June 1985.        
 Charlotte and Melanie are on their way
 to a farm in{Cottingley.}             
  We met the farmer in the farmyard. He
 cleaned his wellies and we went       
 inside. They have 200 cattle and 138  
 sheep and lambs. The sheep are Scotch 
 half breeds and lambing season is     
 February to March. He said they       
 usually get about 1 3/4 lambs per     
 ewe.The sheep have to be dipped once a
 year by law, but at this farm they are
 dipped twice, in June and October, in 
 an approved sheep dip. The sheep are  
 sheared with electric and hand shears.
  They can catch {FOOTROT,LAMB DYSENTRY
{PULPY KIDNEY,TETNUS, BLACK DISEASE and
{CLOSTRIDIUM OEDEMATIENS}and they have 
 to be vaccinated against them. They   
 eat hay, consentrates, grass and in   
 winter, they eat silage.
