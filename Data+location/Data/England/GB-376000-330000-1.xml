This block is predominantly a farming  
area, each farm having the usual farm- 
house and buildings.  There are a few  
small areas of woodland, which are not 
used commercially, and one large area  
of conifers, planted for later         
commercia use, by the Forestry         
Commission. There is one village with  
its church and chapel, shop and garage.
The whole area has a maze of lanes, but
only one through "B" road which carries
transport.                             
The area is widely used as "dormitory" 
accommodation and people travel into   
their work as there is no local        
industry (farming is the only local    
type of work).  It is a truly rural    
area in every sense.
