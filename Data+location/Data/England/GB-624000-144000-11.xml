		<title>11Crime in Lydden</title>
		<content>The most common crime in Lydden is     
vandalism and criminal damage.Most of  
these offences are committed by a small
group of teenagers.Other crimes include
minor burglaries,traffic offences,sheep
rustling and attacks on sheep by dogs  
which can be a serious problem.Some    
of the criminals are local but Lydden  
is also affected occasionally by       
travelling offenders who come off the  
A2,commit the crime,and move swiftly   
on.Any youngsters who are caught are   
taken home by the police and their     
parents are spoken to.Older detainees  
are taken to Dover Police Station.The  
rural policeman is occasionally        
attacked but the person involved is    
nearly always drunk.The regular        
policeman has a part time lady         
constable to help him.She is a typist  
during the day and is called upon to   
assist when necessary.                 </content>
