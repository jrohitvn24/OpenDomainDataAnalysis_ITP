 St John's Church Smalley is built of  
 stone and stands in an extensive      
 churchyard at the southern end of the 
 village, hidden from the main road by 
 trees. It is very pleasant and quiet  
 there. Inside, the church has a large,
 light nave and a small chancel.The    
 church tower in which hang the bells, 
 is separate from the main church      
 buildings which is unusual.           
{BAPTIST CHURCH}                       
 The Baptist Church stands in the      
 centre of the village separated from  
 the road by a small graveyard in which
 we found one gravestone dating back   
 to 1890 (Elizabeth Woolley). The      
 church is built of brick and is       
 rectangular in shape with a small     
 extension on one side. The roof is    
 high and covered with grey slates.    
 Five windows have stained glass.      </content>
