		<title>14A Visit to Alton</title>
		<content>    Here are some places you might go  
 to on a visit to Alton:               
    The Watercress Line, opened in 1977
 and added to this year, now runs from 
 Alton to Ropley and is operated by    
 steam trains.                         
    St.Lawrence Church still bears the 
 marks of a battle between Roundhead   
 soldiers who made a surprise attack on
 the town, and Cavalier forces, during 
 the Civil War.                        
    Market Square is the scene for     
 Market Day, held on Tuesdays.         
    The Curtis Museum has exhibits     
 which record the history of Alton and 
 its people from Roman times, its      
 traditional crafts and brewing, and   
 the area's wildlife.                  
    The Butts is a triangular piece of 
 land at the south west entry to the   
 town, an open space once used for     
 archery practice, but now for fairs.  </content>
