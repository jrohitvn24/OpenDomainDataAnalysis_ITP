		<content> Miles Laboratories have a research    
 site in Stoke Poges. It is a subsidary
 of a German company. They research new
 drugs for{bacterial infections, fungal
{diseases, metabolic diseases, pain,   
{inflammation,allergies, cardiovascular
{diseases and respiratory diseases.    
      Animals are used in some of the  
 testing but their treatment is        
 strictly controlled. They are humanely
 treated. Even so security has to be   
 strong as there is a minority group in
 this country who break into such      
 establishments and free the animals as
 they think experimentation on animals 
 is wrong.                             
 Similar work is done at Fulmer Hall.
