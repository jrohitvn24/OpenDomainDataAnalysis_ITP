		<content>   Probably the main place for         
 recreation in our area is the{        
{Westerhope Community Centre}which     
 consists of a brand new Asto-turf     
 5-a-side football pitch and tennis    
 court. It also has a bowling green,   
 full size football pitch and a youth  
 club which organises trips.           
   All ages can use the 'Tute', they go
 on trips all over.  For the teenagers 
 in the youth club there is pool,      
 snooker, badminton, darts, a disco and
 a tuck shop.                          
   Just across the road is the         
 Westerhope Golf Club.  We asked the   
 chairman some questions.  He replied  
 that there are 850 members in the club
 which is quite a lot.  There are      
 celebrity competitions every year when
 famous people play such as Jimmy      
 Tarbuck.                              
                                       </content>
