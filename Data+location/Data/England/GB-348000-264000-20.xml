		<title>20    THE DISUSED CANAL</title>
		<content> In 1777 an ambitious scheme was       
 proposed, that of connecting          
 Leominster to Stourport, Hereford and 
 to the Severn at Bridgnorth, by a     
 number of canals. Nothing was done    
 until the scheme for a canal to       
 Stourport was revived in 1790. Work   
 was begun on the canal but great      
 difficulties were encountered         
 especially in constructing a tunnel   
 under{Putnal}field in the             
 neighbourhood of{Orleton.}These were  
 eventually overcome and in 1796 a     
 length of canal was opened between    
{Leominster}and the coalfields near    
{Mamble.}In December 1796 fourteen     
 barges arrived at the{Wharf}in        
 Leominster. The cost of extending to  
 Stourport was too much, and plans were
 abandoned. The canal was a thing of   
 the past by 1830. The Shrewsbury and  
 Hereford Railway Co. bought the land. </content>
