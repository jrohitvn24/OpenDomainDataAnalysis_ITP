		<content> A survey in our school showed that all
 children had some special leisure time
 interest.                             
 The local areas of sport in Gillingham
 are places like the Black Lion Sports 
 Centre and the Ice Rink. In my spare  
 time I often go to the Strand swimming
 pool.  I usually meet someone down    
 there so it is very enjoyable it is   
 also very cheap for only 30p. The     
 crazy golf course is quite popular    
 with me. Gillingham has quite a lot of
 places for leisure and some of them   
 are beautiful like the B.M.X. park,   
 which used to be a skateboard park    
 but now bikes do stunts there and     
 the stunts which they do are          
 dangerous. Children mostly go to      
 clubs like brownies and cubs which    
 they find very interesting..
