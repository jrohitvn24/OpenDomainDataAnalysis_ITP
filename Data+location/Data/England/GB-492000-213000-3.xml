		<content> Marsworth of 1985 is virtually a      
 dormitory village.From being one,the  
 inhabitants of which ,either worked on
 the local farms or were employed by   
 the Grand Union Canal, it has become  
 one in which practically all the      
 working population have to find       
 employment outside the parish,many    
 travelling as far as London.          
 Since 1900 the population has doubled 
 to 600 and the number of dwellings has
 doubled to 200.                       
 Way of life changed by mechanization  
 of agriculture and the cessation of   
 commercial traffic on the canal.      
 At the beginning of the century women 
 were employed in the now extinct straw
 plaiting.
