		<title>17VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>   The Village Hall is about 61 years  
 old and the land was leased for 99    
 years.  The first hall was a hut moved
 from Boreham air-field.               
   At the end of World War I a fund was
 set up to reinforce the hall.  The    
 land next to it was bought as a       
 memorial garden.  It is now a car-    
 park.                                 
   The hall is run by a management     
 committee.  Jackie Copsey is the      
 secretary, and has been so for about  
 six years.                            
   Many local clubs use the facilities 
 at the hall.  There is a weekly Youth 
 Club and a twice monthly over-50s club
 called 'The Good Companions'.  There  
 is a Village Society which holds      
 monthly bingo sessions and a 200 Club 
 lottery, raising money for hall       
 improvements.  It has recently had a  
 new ceiling, and other re-decorations.</content>
