		<content>    During the spring of 1985 a new    
 word was to be seen around the town   
 of Devizes.  This word was "BOTO-X" - 
 pronounced "Boato-cross".  The inhabi-
 tants of Devizes wondered what this   
 strange word could mean.  Gradually   
 its meaning became clear.  There was  
 to be a race on the pounds beside the 
 flight of locks of the Kennet and Avon
 Canal just outside the town.          
    The purpose of the event was to    
 raise funds for The Kennet and Avon   
 Canal Trust and The Bath Cancer Unit, 
 which provides treatment and          
 facilities for patients from a large  
 area of the West Country. The Kennet  
 and Avon Canal Trust hoped that this  
 event would emphasise the suitability 
 of the canal and its environs for     
 family recreation.                    
    The weekend of July 22nd and  23rd 
 was devoted to this event.            </content>
