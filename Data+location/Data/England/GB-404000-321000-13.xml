		<title>13Blithfield Church</title>
		<content> Blithfield Church as mentioned in the 
 Doomesday Book 1086 where it was      
 recorded as Blidevelt.  A village of  
 lithfield is said to have existed near
 the church held by Roger de Lacy .    
 Members of the Blithfield family      
 worshipped and were buried in the     
 church until the Bagos took over the  
 hall in 1360.  The Georgian rectory   
 was burnt down in 1962.  The church   
 stands in an isolated position behind 
 the Hall and is approached from the   
 north side by a long single track road
 between fields.  It is kept in good   
 repair although some fine 13th        
 centuary stained glass field.  The    
 east window was erected in the 1960s  
 to the memory of the 6th Baron Bagot. 
 The parishoners care for the graceyard
 which is still used.  The church is   
 now kept locked because of the fear of
 theft.                                </content>
