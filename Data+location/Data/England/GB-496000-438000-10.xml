		<title>10BISHOP BURTON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The shop/post office is open every    
 week day from 9am to 6pm, on Saturday 
 from 9am to 5pm and on Sunday from    
 10.30am to 2pm. Facilities available  
 are:post office,banking, small general
 store, off license and dry cleaning.  
   Many pensioners use the service for 
 their weekly groceries and for        
 collecting their pensions.  The       
 postmaster offers a grocery delivery  
 service and operates a fruit and      
 vegetable round.                      
 Despite some initial concern the      
 Agricultural College student shop does
 not greatly affect trade.             
 The proprietors provide an essential  
 service for the village, especially   
 for the old, housebound and infirm,   
 who are not able to go shopping       
 themselves.  There is concern that the
 shop is becoming less viable and      
 therefore be threatened with closure. </content>
