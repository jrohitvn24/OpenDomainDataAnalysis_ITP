		<title>15THE SALE OF CHESTNUT POLES</title>
		<content> Poles which are not to be used by the 
 Cowdray estate are sold at auctions,  
 which take place on the last Tuesday  
 in October and end on 25th March.  A  
 poster exists, which advertises the   
 auction at the King's Arms, Henley, in
 1838.  It is traditional for the      
 workers on the coppice plantations and
 the buyers to partake of a venison    
 lunch at the last auction of the year,
 and Lord Cowdray has continued this   
 custom.                               
 Beams in old houses, reputedly oaken, 
 are frequently of chestnut wood, which
 is as durable as the heart of oak, and
 much more quickly produced than oak.
