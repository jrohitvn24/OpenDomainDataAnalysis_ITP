		<title>15Seaton Parish Council</title>
		<content>    Each village has its own Parish    
 Council, which is the basic unit of   
 local government in rural England     
 today. The Parish Council must not be 
 confused with the Parochial Church    
 Council, which runs the local church. 
 This information came from Mr Biggs,  
 who is the local chairman.            
                                       
    Seaton Parish Council is very      
 small, and does not have many powers. 
 It deals with local village matters,  
 of which the village hall seems to be 
 the most important. The Council meets 
 every three months, and only 5 people 
 regularly attend the meetings, unless 
 a matter of special interest is on the
 agenda.
