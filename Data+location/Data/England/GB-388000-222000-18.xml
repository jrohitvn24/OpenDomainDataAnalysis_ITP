		<content> How we did it:                        
 The children went out to the different
 habitats and tried to collect         
 Minibeasts. These were any animals    
 smaller than an adult mouse that we   
 could find.                           
 Many of the insects were difficult to 
 identify. The weevil was called a Kiwi
 by some of the children because of its
 appearance. Many of the flying        
 creatures proved ellusive and we had  
 no access to a Night Moth Trap. The   
 children of another class made insect 
 traps so we didn't duplicate this     
 work. We relied on stealth and        
 swiftness of hand.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
