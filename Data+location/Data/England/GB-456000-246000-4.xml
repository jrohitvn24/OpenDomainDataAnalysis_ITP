		<content>{FOXHUNTING}in this area is by the     
 Grafton Hunt with 35 couple hounds.   
 Their purpose is to control the number
 of foxes with 33 brace of fox killed  
 last season.  With 1 Huntsman, 2      
 Whipper-in &amp; 4 Masters they have a    
 field of approx. 50 on Tues. &amp; 100 on 
 Sat.  Payment is by both subscription 
 &amp; field money.  Some follow in cars,  
 on bicycles &amp; on foot where possible. 
 Generally the farmers are in favour of
 hunting, many riding to hounds, any   
 dissent coming from outside the area. 
 Good relations are maintained by the  
 hunt repairing any damage incurred,   
 anyone misbehaving in the field is    
 sent home.  The hunt also provide a   
 service collecting fallen stock. There
 is an active Supporters Club running  
 Clay Pigeon Shoots, Skittles &amp; other  
 social events.  Point to Point &amp;      
 Hunter Trials are also organised.     </content>
