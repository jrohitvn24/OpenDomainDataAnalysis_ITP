		<title>13SPORTS DAY</title>
		<content> EVERY YEAR A SCHOOL SPORTS DAY TAKES  
 PLACE TO TRY AND WIN A TROPHY.ALL FOUR
 TEAMS;SWALW,WHARFE,URE AND NIDD TAKE  
 PART AGAINST EACH OTHER TO WIN POINTS.
 THE TEAM WHO GETS THE MOST POINTS WINS
 THE CUP.                              
 ON THE MORNING OF SPORTS DAY I HELPED 
 TO PUT OUT THE EQUIPMENT.THEN PARENTS 
 CAME FLOODING IN TO WATCH THE RACES.  
 WE ALL SAT DOWN AND THE RACES BEGAN.  
 I HELPED TO GIVE OUT THE BADGES TO THE
 WINNERS.                              
 THE OBSTACLE RACE WAS THE BEST TO     
 WATCH.CHILDREN HAD TO DRESS UP,CRAWL  
 UNDER A NET,RUN ALONG A BENCH,JUMP A  
 HURDLE AND THEN CROSS THE FINISH.     
 WHEN ALL THE POINTS WERE ADDED UP URE 
 TEAM HAD WON AND SO THE TWO CAPTAINS  
 CAME UP TO RECEIVE THE TROPHY.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
