 the week at the larger stores.For the 
 week nearly everybody went to         
 Tesco.The second most popular shop was
 Sainsbury's.Co-op and Asda came       
 next.All the main shops are in Lincoln
 except for Asda which is in North     
 Hykeham.                              
 Most people go to the large stores in 
 their own cars but a couple of people 
 go on the free transport.
