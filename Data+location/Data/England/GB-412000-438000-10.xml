		<content> One of the most well known characters 
 in the area is the retired{huntsman   
{of the Airedale Beagles,Jack White.   
 Born in Eldwick,Jack tells how life   
 has changed here in the last fifty    
 years.Every farm used to have dairy   
 herds,pigs and hens and sell milk to  
 locals.Some was taken to Bingley and  
 sent by train to Bradford in churns.  
 For thirty eight years Jack lived at  
 the Huntsman's Cottage next to the    
 beagle kennels.He travelled all over  
 the North of England with his pack.   
 At home in Eldwick Jack has his own   
 collection of hunting horns,models,   
 and photos.An oil painting of Jack in 
 Patterdale with the hunt is treasured.
 In his workshop he makes tack for     
 friends.{Jack uses leather,wax,and    
{thread with lots of handtools to make 
{bridles,head-collars,lead reins,crops,
{whips,stirrup leathers and harnesses. </content>
