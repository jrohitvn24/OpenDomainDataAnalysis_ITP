		<title>14 Farming</title>
		<content>  Most of the arable farmland in the   
area is a mixture of sandy soil and    
black fenland soil. The crops grown are
mainly barley,wheat,sugar beet,oil seed
rape,carrots and potatoes. One farm    
also grows asparagus which provides a  
lot of casual work for the residents   
during the season. The sugar beet is   
sent to the local sugar beet factory at
Bury St.Edmunds and oil seed rape is a 
fairly new crop which has become more  
important in recent years due to the   
change in diet habits of the population
who tend to now use vegetable oil more 
than animal fats for cooking.          
Livestock in the area is mainly        
intensively managed  inside buildings. 
There is a pig farm,a chicken farm and 
another chicken farm that produces     
eggs and boiling fowls.   There are    
many privately owned horses and ponies 
and a few cattle.                      </content>
