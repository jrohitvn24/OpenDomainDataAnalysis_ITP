		<title>20PROBLEMS OF TYDD ST.GILES</title>
		<content>    Villagers worry about employment   
 for young people.Nowadays farmers     
 employ fewer workers, and there are   
 practically  no other opportunities in
 the village.A small wrought-iron works
 has started,but employs only one young
 man.                                  
    Recently,the last village pub has  
 closed,general feeling being that the 
 brewery deliberately allowed it to run
 down,so that they could sell it for   
 housing.Protests have succeeded in    
 delaying the sale  while the matter is
 reconsidered.Loss of the village pub  
 leaves a large hole in village life.  
    The possibility that the village   
 school may close is another worry.The 
 roll has fallen to 4 3,and there has  
 been talk of merging with the schoool 
 in the neighbouring village.          
    Contributors - the schoolchildren  
 of Tydd St.Giles.                     </content>
