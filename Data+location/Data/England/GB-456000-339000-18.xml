 The Race Course is on the edge of     
 Sneinton near West Lake and below     
 Colwick Woods and over the other end  
 is a little adventure park where      
 children can play.Races usually take  
 place on Monday and Tuesday           
 evenings.The Race Course is one and a 
 half miles all the way around the     
 inside of the track.The horses have to
 run round the track and see who       
 wins.Some people bet who is going to  
 win for money.There is a stand at the 
 top of the track where spectators     
 sit and watch the race.The jockeys get
 changed in a changing room.When we    
 went down to the Race Course with our 
 Geography class a man showed us       
 round.We looked in all the stables and
 saw some horses.There were birds      
 nesting in the roof of the stables.
