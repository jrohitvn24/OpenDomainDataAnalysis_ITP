		<content> Although the area has only one village
 there are many ways to enjoy oneself. 
  Tourists visit to climb the nearby   
 Cheviot Hills, hang-glide, bird-watch,
 walk through the woods or go fishihg. 
 They stay at the pub when it is open  
 (currently closed for sale) and join  
 locals for a game of darts, pool or   
 something to eat. There are two fox-  
 hunts in the region and game shooting.
 The village hall is well used for many
 activities and can be hired for dances
 and parties. There is a local cricket 
 club with its own ground and a school 
 field for children. Some people belong
 to football, rugby or tennis clubs in 
 nearby towns. These places also offer 
 a good range of evening classes.      
  Some people prefer to stay at home to
 bake for the Church Fete or wayside   
 stalls, to play instruments or watch  
 television.                           </content>
