		<title>17RODMERSHAM CHURCH.</title>
		<content> St Nicholas Church dates from Norman  
 Times. We got into the church with a  
 big iron key. The church has an Early 
 Norman window. The Rood Screen is     
 mainly Victorian but the 15th Century 
 canopied Sedilia and Screen are made  
 of chestnut. Between 1874 &amp; 1896 there
 was much Victorian restoration. They  
 copied a font but afterwards found the
 original one in someone's conservatory
 as a flowerpot. The 15th Century      
 knapped flint Tower houses the belfry 
 with 6 bells, with some hand bells in 
 a cupboard. The steep spiral steps are
 key-shaped. When we got to the top we 
 had a remarkable view; you could see  
 Sheerness. The front of the graveyard 
 is mown and the rest the sheep graze. 
 In the graveyard there is a grave for 
 5 children who all died under the age 
 of 6. There is a lych gate which has  
 different religious quotations.       </content>
