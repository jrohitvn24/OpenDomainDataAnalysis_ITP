		<title>03HINXHILL ESTATE FARM 2</title>
		<content>The farm is mixed. There are 207 dairy 
cows and 500 cows for finishing beef.  
These figures were taken 10th June     
1985.The ages of cattle range from 1   
week to 2 years. The dairy cows are a  
cross between British Freisian and a   
Canadian breed.The cross is made as the
Canadian breed has a higher milk       
producing rate. The bulls are various  
breeds Hereford, Aberdeen Angus,       
Simmental and Limousin are present at  
the farm. None of the cattle are kept  
out in winter. All are housed from     
October to the end of April sometimes  
longer for the smaller cows. When the  
young bulls are anything from a day old
the process of burning out their horns 
begins.A contraption rather like a     
blowlamp is placed on the horns and    
destroys them.Before this takes place  
each animal is given an anasthetic.    
When ready the bulls are sold for beef.</content>
