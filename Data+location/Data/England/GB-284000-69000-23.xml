<content>

Traces of Neolithic people have been found at Berry's Wood Hill Fort near Bradley Manor. This was a contour hill fort that enclosed about 11 acres.Milber Down camp was built in the 1st century BC. Later it was occupied by the Romans - coins and a pavement have been found.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are remains of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle on Highweek Hill. This was probably a lookout post to watch people coming up the Teign estuary. A village grew up around this castle which over the years became Highweek - the village on the high ground. On the low ground around the River Lemon arose another settlement which became part of Wolborough Manor. &lt;br />&lt;br />
