		<title>10 Fruit Farming (2)</title>
		<content>Surprisingly for such a large farm     
there are only 75 permanent            
employees.Seasonal employment does     
figure in the farming year.Up to 200   
employees are taken on between June and
September.They will be local people,   
often mothers accompanied by young     
children.Arnolds sell their fruit to   
Sainsburys Supermarket chain as well as
to the whole country on a wholesale    
basis.Their apples can be spotted in   
Sainsburys by the code A.There are 550 
acres (223 hectares) of apple orchard. 
Every year about 20 acres are          
grubbed out.Winter wheat is sown after 
the grubbing out.The  replanting of a  
new orchard takes place the following  
year.The roots of the young fruit trees
are carefully ptotected from frost with
a mulch of straw.The trees will be kept
for between 20 and 60 years,depending  
on their type.                         </content>
