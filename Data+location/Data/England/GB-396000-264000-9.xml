		<content>{Education}in Bentley took place in    
 the village{school}which was built in 
 1882. Fifty years ago children started
 school at 5 and left at 14.The        
 majority of children took no          
{examinations.}It was customary to walk
 to school. There were no school       
 dinners but free milk was issued      
 every day. Few children had{holidays} 
 as the majority helped with the       
 farming. It was not unusual for boys  
 to truant on market days or to harrow 
 behind the plough instead of attending
 school. The school closed in 1962 .The
 village children now attend Tardebigge
 First school and the  Ridgeway        
 Middle school, Astwood Bank.
