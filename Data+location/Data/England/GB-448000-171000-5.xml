		<title>05THE M4 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> In December 1971 the section of the M4
 at Chieveley was completed and opened 
 to traffic. This meant you could      
 travel all the way from London to     
 Wales (140 miles) in two or three     
 hours. It had taken 10 years to build.
 People living nearby had been worried 
 about things like the Berkshire       
 countryside being spoilt by the road. 
 The farmers were worried that their   
 cattle would stray onto the road and  
 be killed, and the land owners were   
 worried that the roots of the trees   
 near the road would become loose and  
 the trees would fall down. Because of 
 the motorway many more people could   
 live in our area and work in London,  
 and the farms got more machinery so   
 less people were needed to work       
 there. Today the verges of motorways  
 are becoming important nature reserves
 for wild flowers and animals.         </content>
