		<content> Our school was built in 1957, but it  
 has had some mobile classrooms added. 
 There are 5 junior classes, 3 infant  
 classes and a nursery unit. There are 
 about 220 children. We have a big     
 hall, a swimming pool which is 12     
 meters long, a play ground with       
 pitches and games on it, a football   
 pitch and a big field to play on. WE  
 are starting a wild area where the    
 grass and the weeds are not cut. There
 are going to be 2 ponds and there are 
 lots of frogs.                        
 The nearest primary schools are Instow
 and Sticklepath                       
 The nearest comprehensive schools are 
 at Barnstaple. Children who go there  
 have to leave early to catch the bus. 
 There are some private schools in the 
 area as well.
