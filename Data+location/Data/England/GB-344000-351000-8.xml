		<content>   As this is a{rural area}life seems  
 to go on at a slower pace than in the 
 surrounding towns. The main concerns  
 appear to be connected with{ecology}  
 e.g.{fox hunting, badger baiting}     
 (illegal),{tree and hedge conservation
 etc. Other concerns in the village are
{litter, street lighting, speed limits,
{bus shelter and C.N.D.                
   There is mixed feeling about{fox    
{hunting,}the farmers tending to       
 approve as they lose a lot of poultry 
 to the foxes.                         
   Another area of concern is the      
{disposal of garden rubbish}and large  
 unwanted items. Most villagers would  
 like to see a skip provided but there 
 is some disagreement as to where it   
 might be sited.                       
 Most people do not wish for extra     
{street lighting}as they wish to retain
 the rural atmosphere of the village.  </content>
