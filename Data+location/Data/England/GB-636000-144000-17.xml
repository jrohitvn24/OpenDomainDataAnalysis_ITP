		<title>17DAY IN LIFE OF MR.WAINWRIGHT</title>
		<content> My name is Bob Wainwright,I work at   
 Dover's Eastern Docks as a clerk      
 dealing with Transit documents for the
 large lorries which pass through the  
 port. The company I work for is called
 the Dover Clearance Service. I'm also 
 a part time fireman and I'm on call   
 for the Kent Fire Brigade stationed in
 St.Margarert's.                       
   A typical day would be_ wake at     
 4.50am_get dressed,have breakfast and 
 leave for work at 5.30am. I work a 12 
 hour shift_checking papers all day.   
 I arrive home at about 6.15pm. After  
 my tea I change and go off to the Fire
 Brigade drill night(Monday). There we 
 clean the engine and make sure all the
 gear is in working order. Then we     
 practise using the equipment. I get   
 home around 10.00pm when I have a cup 
 of tea and go to bed.
