		<title>18THE WOOL TRADE</title>
		<content> The old wool trade has left a mark on 
the area. It was a time when the local 
area had some wealth and this has been 
reflected in the buildings. The old    
timbered cottages are the commomest    
buildings out of the towns. They are   
much sought after but often only for   
second homes. The church at Kersey has 
also benefited from the wool trade.    
Like many of the local churches the    
fabric and style of the building shows 
that the local merchants and farmers   
have given generously to the church.   
The local stone is flint yet this      
church has had the money to import     
limestone  to give the walls support.  
The large population put pressure on   
the local agriculture and the enclosure
movement was well advanced by Tudor    
times, this can be seen in the number  
of spread out farms, often containing  
the word "Tye".                        </content>
