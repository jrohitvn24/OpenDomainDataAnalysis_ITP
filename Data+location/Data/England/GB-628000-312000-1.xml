		<title>01A Slice of mid-Norfolk</title>
		<content>{The area is mainly covered by arable  
{farmland but contains the villages of 
{Salhouse,Little Plumstead and         
{Rackheath.It is crossed by three of   
{the roads which radiate from Norwich, 
{the county town of Norfolk.To the     
{north and east are the Norfolk Broads,
{a popular holiday area.Although there 
{is employment in traditional local    
{industries,farming and a new          
{industrial estate at Rackheath,many of
{the people who live in the villages   
{commute to and from Norwich to work.  
{The villages contain a mixture of     
{housing from ancient thatched cottages
{to modern housing estates.Public      
{transport,both by road and rail is    
{very limited and, as in many other    
{parts of Norfolk, the car is a        
{necessity rather than a luxury. }
