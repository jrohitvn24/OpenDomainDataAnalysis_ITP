 attend either Little Smeaton Primary  
 School or Brayton High School under   
 the auspices of the North Yorkshire   
 Education Committee. Otherwise        
 virtually all the children attend     
 schools in Norton commencing with     
 nursery provision at three through to 
 sixth provision at eighteen.          
    There is nursery provison for 60   
 children AT NORTON FIRST SCHOOL       
 (Headmistress Mrs.M.Cant). They can   
 start nursery education at 3+ and then
 normally transfer to the First School 
 at 4+. At this level attendance is    
 voluntary with compulsory education   
 starting at 5. Most children spend    
 four years here before transferring at
 8+ to NORTON MIDDLE SCHOOL (Headmaster
 Mr.I.T.Wild) for the next stage of    
 their education. There are 202 pupils 
 on roll here.Both the First and Middle</content>
