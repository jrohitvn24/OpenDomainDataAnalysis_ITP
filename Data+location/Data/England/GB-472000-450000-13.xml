		<title>13WILBERFOSS DRAINAGE/LITTER</title>
		<content>   In the past 6 years the village has 
 been flooded on 4 occasions.  In order
 to prevent this in the future the beck
 is being widened and an overflow      
 channel is being dug to carry away    
 excess water. The cost in 1985 will be
 $7,000. There has been much argument  
 and many meetings with the local land 
 drainage board about the proposed im- 
 provements, as some people would have 
 lost large parts of their gardens.    
 This has now been settled.            
 LITTER. In the village there are only 
 three litter bins to be found. In a   
 survey it was found that the commonest
 type of litter was   plastic wrappings
 and containers.  Empty drink cans were
 the next most common.  Plastic litter 
 is a big problem as it does not rot   
 away and blows all over the place in  
 the wind, making it difficult to clear
 up.It is a hazard to farm animals too.</content>
