		<title>19Flooding</title>
		<content> There was a major flood alert on the  
 night of 1st February 1983, when,     
 almost 30 years to the day since the  
 East Coast flood disaster of 1953, in 
 gale force winds the river level rose 
 1.7 metres above the predicted level. 
 Although a sudden drop in the wind    
 strength prevented major flooding, as 
 the danger passed around midnight, a  
 freak wave surge pushed the river     
 level 2 metres above prediction, and  
 above the 1953 levels. Gorleston      
 lifeboat (Barham) was moved because of
 the high water and small boats in the 
 river were manned to prevent them     
 being washed up and left high and dry.
 Gorleston Quayside attracted a throng 
 of onlookers, criticised by the       
 ploice, the Stormhouse Cafe served hot
 drinks to emergency service workers   
 and a nightwatchman feared to have    
 fallen in was later found safe.       </content>
