		<content> Children who live in the square       
 studied attend one of the four schools
 built in the area. Since they are not 
 expected to attend for 24 hours a day 
 and seven days a week many children   
 fill their day with many other        
 activities. Watching video films at   
 home, riding BMX bikes and playing at 
 nearby parks are very popular. Some   
 children prefer to play at home with  
 dolls and prams. A few have a swing in
 their back gardens. Some children     
 attend Cubs and Brownies at St Chads  
 Church. Older members of the Community
 enjoy the Pensioners Club at Wood End 
 Community Centre and a few have a meal
 at Eburne school where Junior children
 are the servers. Many other adults are
 active in the Wood End Tenants        
 Association who aim to improve the    
 area's image.
