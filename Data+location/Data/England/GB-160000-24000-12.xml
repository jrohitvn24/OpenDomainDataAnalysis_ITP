     Around Porthleven there used to be
 a lot of smuggling. The Ship Inn used 
 to be a favourite meeting place for   
 smugglers. From one of the caves on   
 the beach there is a secret passage   
 which comes up under the floor boards 
 at Methleigh Farm which is about a    
 mile in land.                         
          MINING                       
    Around Porthleven there was a lot  
 of lead and silver mining. One of the 
 roads called Wheal Rose is named after
 a mine. The miners used to get their  
 pay at a house on Breageside.         
          HARBOUR                      
    The Harbour, originally built by   
 Harveys, used to be used for importing
 cargoes of coal, limestone, timber,   
 salt and cement. Over 10,000 tons of  
 coal was imported in 1870.
