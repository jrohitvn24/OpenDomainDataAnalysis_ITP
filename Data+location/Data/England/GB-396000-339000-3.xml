To hide Huntley Wood Sand and Gravel   
Quarry from the view of all the houses 
round about, the Company did not dig   
into the surrounding bank and top soil 
has been placed in appropriate         
locations for tree planting.           
                                       
In 7 to 10 years the Company will have 
exhausted the useful and easily reached
deposits and will close this site and  
transfer operations to another nearby  
location.                              
                                       
The Company do not know what they will 
do with the site as yet, but they      
cannot just abandon it. It may be      
turned into an area for woodland, as it
was before quarrying began, and become 
available for recreation.
