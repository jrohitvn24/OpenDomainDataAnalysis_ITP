 In Midhurst and its surrounding area  
 conservation is the main subject of   
 concern to residents.The area has many
 fine old buildings and people want all
 new ones to blend with them.They want 
 the woodlands and the Downs to be     
 preserved,not cleared or ploghed for  
 farming.Most people want the villages 
 to retain their present size,and the  
 whole environment to stay as it       
 is.Litter,oil drilling,noise and dogs 
 fouling pavements all cause loud      
 protests.There are not many large     
 protest groups but small groups inform
 the local press of their concern.It is
 mainly elderly and fairly wealthy     
 people who complain for Midhurst is an
 affluent area and there is more than  
 the usual number of elderly residents 
 with long-standing connections with   
 the district.                         </content>
