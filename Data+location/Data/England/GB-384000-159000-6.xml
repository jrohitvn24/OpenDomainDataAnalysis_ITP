		<content>   Staverton Community policeman is    
 P.C. Williams. He was a milkman before
 he trained to be a policeman. His     
 training took fifteen weeks. Before   
 becoming a Community Policeman he had 
 helped to train police dogs, including
 training them to follow the trail of a
 particular person, perhaps a burglar. 
   His job is to get to know the area  
 and the people who live and work in   
 it and to help people in trouble.     
 Sometimes, he has had to break into   
 houses if people have been taken ill  
 and cannot open the door. When he is  
 on night duty, from midnight to eight 
 o'clock in the morning, he has to     
 check that all the property is safe.  
 Sometimes he is sent away to help     
 deal with the riots at football       
 matches in Swindon.                   
 Holt is served by a group of similar  
 officers know as the Rural Team.      </content>
