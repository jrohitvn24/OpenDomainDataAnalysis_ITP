		<title>05LOCAL HISTORY,SOUTH FEN</title>
		<content>    As one might expect, there is much 
 local history to be gleaned from the  
 names of the two hamlets in this area,
 Tongue End and Twenty.                
    The name 'Tongue End' originates   
 from the shape made by the river Glen 
 at the hamlet where it meets its      
 confluence, the river Bourne Eau. It  
 had previously been known both as     
 'Adventurers Land' (derived from the  
 Dutch who first came to drain the     
 land) and later as 'Little Britain'.  
    The hamlet of Twenty came with the 
 new railway which built a station in  
 the close proximity known as 'Bourne  
 North Fen'.  However, due to the near-
 ness of Bourne itself it was decided  
 to change the name of the former with 
 the railway company adopting the      
 number of the nearest mile post, hence
 the name'Twenty';twenty miles from the
 mainline at Saxby, near Melton, Leics.</content>
