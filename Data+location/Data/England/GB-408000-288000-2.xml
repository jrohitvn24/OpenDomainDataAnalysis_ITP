		<title>02A day in the life of Clare.</title>
		<content>A typical Sunday would begin at 7.30   
when I get up and have tea and toast   
for breakfast.Then I get ready for     
mass.Mass was special today because my 
brother Nicolas made his First Holy    
Communion.This is one of the most      
important days of his life when he     
received Jesus for the first time.     
After mass there was a celebration     
breakast for the children.When we got  
home my dad took our family to his     
friends farm in Redditch.We somtimes   
pick berries or go on long walks.We put
out hay for the cows to eat at feeding 
time,and we watch them being milked.   
They also have goats and horses at the 
farm.At 4.30 we have our dinner and    
afterwards I play games with my brother
and sisters.At 6.30 I have a bath and  
come downstairs to watch the           
television.At 8.30 I go to bed so that 
I am not tired in the morning.         </content>
