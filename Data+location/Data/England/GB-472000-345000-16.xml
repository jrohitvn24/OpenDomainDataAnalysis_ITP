		<content>{Flintham Hall}is a listed building    
 with an important{conservatory}built  
 by Hine. Until about 30 years ago a   
 high % of the village was employed by 
 the Estate and even today approx 30   
 houses still belong to the Estate     
 although it's employees barely reach  
 double figures.                       
 Until 1945 Trinity College, Cambridge 
 owned several farms in the village.   
 The village boasts 2{mud dovecotes,}&amp; 
 an ancient{pinfold,}recently restored.
 Many of the buildings built in the C18
 are sideways to the road, apparently  
 because an early 'squire' objected to 
 being seen as he rode down the street.
 On Inholms Road is the old Reading    
 Room besides what was the village pond
 now drained and used as a camping     
 ground by the Scouts, except in winter
 when it fills with water from the     
 Vicarage Field.                       </content>
