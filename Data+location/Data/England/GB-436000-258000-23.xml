Concerns.&lt;br />&lt;br />Year 6 children at Harbury Primary School were invited to list their concerns in 2011. The first question was 'What concerns you most in 2011?'  Out of 31 children, 23 either left the space blank or said there were no concerns.  How great to be 10 or 11 years old!  Concerns expressed were pollution (2), rubbish and litter, inflation, family, global warming, going to their new school and not making enough friends.  Again 23 children had no worries about the future. However, four were worried that people would not respect the world, others that they might not find a good job, one that animals were facing extinction and another worried about falling out with friends.   Local concerns were with graffiti, litter, bad behaviour, youths drinking, litter and gypsies.  And once again one was worried about leaving the safe haven of Harbury School!&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
