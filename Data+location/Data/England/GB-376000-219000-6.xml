		<title>06HOME LIFE IN HIGHNAM</title>
		<content>   A questionaire conducted about home 
 and village life revealed that out of 
 20 children from Highnam Primary      
 School 75% lived on the Maidenhall    
 estate while the remaining 25% lived  
 nearby.                               
   The majority of 75% lived in semi-  
 detatched houses,the remainder living 
 in detatched.                         
   Only 2%  had lived in Highnam more  
 than 6 years and had live-in relatives
   Over 60% of the parents working,    
 worked in Gloucester,and at least     
 another 32% worked outside and around 
 Gloucester,but even though 60% worked 
 in Gloucester all the children said   
 they would be attending Newent School 
 the next year.                        
   An interesting factor was that only 
 20% of mothers didn't work and that   
 each family had an average of 2 cars, 
 if not more.                          </content>
