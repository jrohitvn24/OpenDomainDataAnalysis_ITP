		<title>17THE TEA-SHOP OWNER, AYSGARTH</title>
		<content> We went to talk to a local cafe owner 
 and he told us about his day. We asked
 why he moved to Aysgarth. He said that
 there were no businesses of the same  
 kind in the area. We asked him what he
 sold and he said he sold things like  
 soup, hot chocolate, waffles with     
 syrup on the top, fruit cake and      
 Wensleydale Cheese and salads - they  
 were the most common items. They open 
 at 10.30 am in the summer and in the  
 winter they open at weekends, and     
 close when people go home. They are   
 most busy at Easter. 4.00 pm is the   
 busiest time of day. Deliveries come  
 from Darlington, Ripon and Malton.    
 They have a part-time baker.  Michael 
 owns two cafes;  one is at the        
 National Park Information Centre and  
 the other one is near the bridge at   
 Aysgarth Falls.
