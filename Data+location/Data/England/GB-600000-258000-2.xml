		<title>02ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content>  In our area the main type of farming 
is arable,most farms reflect this.On   
most farms they use a crop rotation of 
either 5 years or 3 years.             
  The main crops  grown are wheat,     
 barley and sugar beet,although some   
farmers grow oil seed rape and pears.  
Straw is often produced and usually    
sold to local people.                  
   Before being sold the crops are     
stored at 16% moisture in a barn or    
storage bins,which can each hold a 100 
tons of grain.Some bins are specially  
designed for drying the crops when the 
level of moisture is too high.         
  Barns are also used for storing      
machinery,such as ploughs,harrows,     
rollers,tractors,combines,balers,etc.
