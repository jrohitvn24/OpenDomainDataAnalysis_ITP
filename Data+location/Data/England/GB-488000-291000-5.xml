		<content>I usually get up about 7a.m.get washed 
and dressed and have my breakfast about
7.45. This normally means Rice Krispies
toast and marmalade and a glass of     
milk. At 8.45 I leave home for school  
with my Mum and my sister Rachael.     
School begins at 8.55 and my favourite 
lesson is P.E. When we do it indoors we
use the school hall and put out several
pieces of equipment such as climbing   
frames,box and springboard. When we go 
outside in the school playground we    
have smaller equipment like bats,balls,
and hoops and we can choose what we    
want to use.I stay at school for my    
dinner and I have a cooked meal.School 
finishes at 3.45p.m. and I go home by  
myself because we live quite near in   
Stafford Rd and it is safe to do so. I 
have my tea at 5.15 and go to bed about
7.30.
