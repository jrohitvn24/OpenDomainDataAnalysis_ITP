		<content>  The local newspaper is called the    
 'Cumberland and Westmorland Herald',  
 and it is published in Penrith. It has
 two parts, one that has lots of local 
 news in, and another with mostly      
 adverts for cars and houses in.       
  In the news this week (Sat. 20th     
 July), is an article about the plans  
 to make the fells into an  'area of   
 outstanding natural beauty' by the    
 Countryside commission. Some of the   
 local council do not want this because
 it might mean some quarries would have
 to close down.                        
  There are also a lot of letters to   
 the editor about the army's plans to  
 buy some more fell to use for training
 soldiers staying at Warcop training   
 centre.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
