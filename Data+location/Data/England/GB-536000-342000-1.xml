		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY OF BLOCK</title>
		<content>   The area is a low land area with    
 much of the farmland lying within a   
 few metres of sea level. There are no 
 hills, just a few small fen islands or
 tofts on which the churches usually   
 stand.Fishtoft church being the best  
 example.                              
   There is no industry, the only thing
 that is anywhere near being industrial
 is the agricultural suppliers at      
 Freiston.                             
   There are three villages - Fishtoft,
 Freiston and Butterwick. Fishtoft and 
 Butterwick have grown with people     
 moving there from Boston, but there   
 has hardly been any building at       
 Freiston.                             
   Nearly all the land is used for     
 arable farming, with very few animals.
   There are no railways or main roads 
 except a tiny stretch of the A52 at   
 the North-West corner.                </content>
