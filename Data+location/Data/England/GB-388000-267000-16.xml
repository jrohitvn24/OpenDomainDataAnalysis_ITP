		<title>16RELIGION IN ELMBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Most people in the area, when asked   
 what religion they are said, Church of
 England. One is Catholic and three    
 Methodist. Of these only a quarter    
 attend church regularly, although a   
 further quarter attend occasionally.  
 The only Church in the area is St.    
 Marys Elmbridge where one service is  
 held each sunday either 9am communion,
 10-30am family communion or 6-30pm    
 evensong. The rector is responsible   
 for Elmbridge, Elmley Lovett, Hampton 
 Lovett and Rushock, parishes, known as
 "The Four Square". St. Marys is small 
 and peaceful and was mainly rebuilt in
 1870 but still has a south door and   
 two piers from the former 12th century
 church. The churchyard is well kept as
 the grave mounds have been levelled,  
 but a variety of wild flowers remain, 
 also a large silver birch and five    
 clipped yew trees. No sunday school.  </content>
