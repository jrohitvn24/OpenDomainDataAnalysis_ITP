		<title>05BRAYDON TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>    The most striking aspect is the    
 almost total lack of public transport.
 One would not expect to find a railway
 station in such a spot, but buses, run
 by the local authorities, rarely call 
 in this outlying area. Bus stops for  
 some housesholds are two miles away,  
 an impossible journey for mothers     
 with young children, and not pleasant 
 for anyone on a cold, wet day.        
    The elderly residents tend to rely 
 on families and neighbours for        
 shopping as they cannot usually afford
 to run a car. Others have to rely     
 totally on their own private transport
 usually a car or, popular with        
 farmers, a Land Rover.                
    Bread and grocery deliveries       
 are made by a van converted into a    
 mobile shop. This service, though, is 
 in jeopardy.
