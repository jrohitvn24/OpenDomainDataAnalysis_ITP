		<title>04DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I get up,at 7.30. I go down stairs and
 I have my breakfast. I feed my dog Max
 and then I have my cup of tea. I get  
 ready for school and then I go and    
 knock for Sam and we walk to school   
 together. After the register has been 
 taken I take it to the secretary. Then
 I go to my maths group. At 10.15 we   
 have song practice. One of the songs  
 we sing is 'When I'm Sixty Four'.     
 After song practice we go out to play.
 In the playground I play hard. For    
 dinner I have a packed lunch. After   
 school I go to gymnastics. It is good.
 Ihave been in for a lot of grading    
 tests. When I get in I play outside   
 and then I go in and watch the        
 television. My favourite programme is 
 Dallas. I go to bed at 10.30 pm.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
