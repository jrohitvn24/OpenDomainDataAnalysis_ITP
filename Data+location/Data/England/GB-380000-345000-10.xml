		<title>10At play in Silverdale</title>
		<content>Our school playground,is rather cramped
and we are often squashed together.It  
is very noisy at breaktime.After we    
have gone indoors the birds fly down   
to eat the scraps of crisps we have    
dropped.There have even been seagulls  
in our yard.When we come out again the 
birds fly away.                        
We play tick,leapfrog,netball,football,
skipping and hopscotch.Sometimes we    
play Stuck-in-the-mud.If you are ticked
you have to stand still until someone  
crawls through your legs.Then you are  
free to play again.                    
Our infants' school is very modern and 
has grass and trees,but in the juniors'
yard,which is all concrete,we have a   
shed and a hut for games equipment.    
On the playground children still play  
traditional games as well as acting out
television programmes.
