		<title>06CONSERVATION-SAND DUNES</title>
		<content> A section of our allocated block      
 forms part of a Local Nature Reserve  
 (known as the Ainsdale and Birkdale   
 Sandhills).This is one of the largest 
 areas of unspoilt duneland left in    
 Britain and 500 acres were designated 
 as a reserve in 1980 to conserve the  
 characteristic landscape and wildlife.
 Since 1978 the Council has been       
 involved in a joint venture with      
 Merseyside County Council and the     
 Countryside Commission (the Coastal   
 Management Scheme).An important aspect
 of the work of this scheme is Dune    
 Conservation.Dune erosion (by sea,wind
 and human trampling) leads to a loss  
 of coastal defences,damage to property
 and the loss of many valuable wildlife
 habitats.Dune restoration involves two
 main processes,sand trapping and      
 marram planting.Sand is trapped behind
 fences and the marram seeds planted.  </content>
