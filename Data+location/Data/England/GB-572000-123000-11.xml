		<title>11Darvell Hall-History</title>
		<content>  Darvell Hall lies about 2miles from  
 the centre of Robertsbridge.The       
 existing building dates from 1722 and 
 served as the Manor House;although it 
 may actually be as old as 1590.It has 
 been extended over the years and was  
 utilised for health purposes as a T.B.
 Sanatorium in the 1920's.The Hall was 
 purchased 1n 1971 by the Hutterian    
 Society of Brothers,an Anabaptist     
 Community of German origin.They have  
 added considerably to the             
 buildings,including facilities for    
 housing,recreation and most of their  
 needs.The site has an area of about   
 200acres including a small farming    
 element,which is used mainly by the   
 Communities children.There is a       
 swimming pool,factory and a large     
 communal dining hall.Most of the new  
 buildings are built in a style which  
 blends with the old.                  </content>
