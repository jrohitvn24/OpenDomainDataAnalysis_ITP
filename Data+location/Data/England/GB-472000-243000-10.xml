		<title>10The Effect of Milton Keynes</title>
		<content>  The building of the new city, Milton 
 Keynes, within a few miles of         
 Potterspury has effected the village  
 in many ways. The price of houses has 
 risen because many people who work in 
 the City find it more agreeable to    
 live outside its confines. On the     
 other hand, the villagers can and do  
 take advantage of the many facilities 
 available in Milton Keynes. There are 
 several Leisure Centres offering      
 swimming, many indoor games and other 
 pursuits. The large shopping centre at
 Central Milton Keynes is well         
 patronised by the villagers, probably 
 to the detriment of the village shop. 
 There is much entertainment available 
 and a fine Central Library. A certain 
 amount of employment has been provided
 for the villagers and many now work in
 Milton Keynes.                        
                                       </content>
