		<title>19THE SEARCH FOR OIL AND GAS</title>
		<content>      The rock formation in this area  
 is the same as in Dorset where gas has
 been found, and because of this the   
 geologists are searching for oil and  
 gas in Lincolnshire, and oil has been 
 found at Welton near Lincoln.         
      On Monday, 3rd June, 1985 a      
 Seismic Survey was carried out in     
 Halton Holegate, with a recording     
 truck and four vehicle mounted        
 Vibrators, followed by a Land Rover   
 and a Transit Van.  The route taken   
 was up Peasgate Lane from Toynton All 
 Saints, past the Council Houses, and  
 up Northorpe Road, and then through   
 the gate by the side of the Nursing   
 Home and across the fields to Ashby.  
 The information gathered is now being 
 studied by petroleum geologists to    
 estimate the possibility of oil and   
 gas in the area.
