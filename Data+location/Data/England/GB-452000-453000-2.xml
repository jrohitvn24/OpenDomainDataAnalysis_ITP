		<content>   This block is mainly occupied by    
 arable farming.  Since the survey was 
 carried out in November, much of the  
 land was lying ploughed and bare.     
 What crops were sown consisted of     
 sugar beet, presumably destined for   
 the nearby B.S.C. processing plant,   
 and winter wheat and barley.          
   There are no significant woodlands  
 or other topographical features in the
 block, except perhaps the distinctive 
 stright rows of poplar trees which act
 as windbreaks for many of the farms in
 the district and have given their name
 to the villages of{Upper}and{Nether   
{Poppleton.}
