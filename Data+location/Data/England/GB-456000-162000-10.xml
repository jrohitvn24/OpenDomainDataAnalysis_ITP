		<title>10POPULATION OF TADLEY (SEX)</title>
		<content> The statistics provided for the Tadley
 area show a variation from the norm in
 the proportions of men and women in   
 the general population of the UK.     
 Overall the percentages are 51.4%     
 women and 48.6% men. In the Tadley    
 area the figures are reversed with    
 48.8% women and 51.2% men. Only over  
 the age of 70 do women outnumber men. 
 Undoubtedly the main cause of this    
 is the number of young, single men    
 living in Boundary Hall, most of them 
 working at the AWRE. Presumably many  
 of them later marry and set up home   
 outside our survey area. There are    
 also many more men in the 45-60 age   
 group than might be expected, some of 
 them living in Boundary Hall.         
 (Boundary Hall is a hostel, like a    
 University Hall of Residence, mainly  
 intended for single staff of the      
 AWRE.)                                </content>
