		<title>20OIL, COAL: CROPWELL BUTLER</title>
		<content> Underground{coal mining}proceeds in   
 the vicinity of Cropwell Butler which 
 adjoins a large working mine at       
 Cotgrave. There are coal reserves     
 which may be worked in the future at  
 Cropwell Butler.There is no open-cast 
 mining. A seismic survey recently     
 conducted in this area close to the   
 Fosse Way revealed the presence of    
{oil.}The discovery was considered to  
 be non-commercial but further surveys 
 are planned. This is the first time,  
 since on-shore oil was first produced 
 in Britain in 1918, that oil has been 
 located south of the Trent in the     
 Midlands.                             
                                       
 The work for this contribution to the 
{Domesday project}has been organised by
 Cropwell Butler &amp; Tithby{Women's      
{Institute.}
