 hens,peacocks,horses,ducks and geese, 
 which he keeps for milk, meat         
 and eggs,but also to try and make some
 money.He does not milk the cows       
 himself.His fields are crops and both 
 annual and perennial grass which is   
 grown for grazing and silage.He grows 
 wheat and barley for animal feed and  
 maize for silage.Oil seed rape is     
 grown for margarine,peas for protein  
 feed for the animals,turnips and kale 
 for the cows.He has 10 acres that he  
 can't farm including{Parham Wood.}He  
 has mink, foxes, badgers,weasels and  
 stoats wild on the farm.They are a    
 nuisance because they kill poultry.
