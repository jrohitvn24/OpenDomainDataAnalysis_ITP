		<content> I Button Making.                      
   A Mr. &amp; Mrs. Case started making    
 buttons in the early eighteenth       
 century in Milborne.  The first       
 buttons were made with wire and       
 cotton, the wire was for the frame.   
 In I850 the Aston family brought a    
 button making machine to Milborne,    
 this meant that the woman and children
 lost their jobs.  The Case family died
 in I912 and the craft tended to die   
 out.  Slowly the women and children   
 started to bring the craft back and at
 present a number of women still make  
 the Dorset button in Milborne.        
 Traditional designs are based on the  
 Union Jack and are often square or    
 rectangular while others are round,   
 with a series of dots of several      
 colours.{
