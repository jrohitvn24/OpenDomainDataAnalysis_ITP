		<content>   On Saturday  the 1st of June I got  
 up got dressed and ate my breakfast.  
 Then I went to gymnastics. We had to  
 be there by 9.30 a.m. When we got     
 there we started to do our exercises, 
 then we practised for a display. My   
 friend and I had to help some of the  
 little ones.                          
   I stayed for another session but    
 my sister didn't. I went on the beam  
 with my two friends Sarah and Vicky.  
 We had to do forward rolls and jumps  
 on it. Then I went on the floor. I did
 my floor routine twice.               
   After gymnastics we went to the     
 seaside. We found a place to sit on   
 the rocks. The tide was coming in.    
   My two sisters Victoria and Ilsa and
 Mummy swam but Daddy and I didn't     
 because it was too cold. Then we went 
 home.                    Emily Elford.
