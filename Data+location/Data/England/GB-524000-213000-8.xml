		<title>08INTERVIEWS WITH LOCAL PEOPLE</title>
		<content> (1) {Mr Charles Brownsel}(70) a former
 pupil, discovered that juniors and    
 infants were now taught separately;   
 rooms were heated by gas fired boiler;
 lunches were cooked on site and       
 infants drank sterilized milk.        
 Children wrote with cartridge pens and
 learnt from TV and radio.  Life had   
 deteriorated considerably.  Walking to
 school was unsafe; punishment 'on the 
 spot' by the local 'Bobby' was        
 abolished and home discipline had     
 become either slack or non-existent.  
 (2){Mrs Sheriff}grandmother and       
 farmers daughter explained there were 
 more cars, trains, planes and         
 subsequently more noise. Children did 
 not help on the land as previously but
 most people had more money and could  
 buy from the shops what they wanted   
 more easily.                          
                                       </content>
