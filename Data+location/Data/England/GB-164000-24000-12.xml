		<content> "Search and Rescue"is a small part of 
 the operations at Culdrose but it is  
 probably what the base is most famous 
 for to the public in Cornwall.The     
 Squadron works with the local rescue  
 services of RNLI,Coastguards and      
 Surf-Life Saving Clubs.               
 Wessex helicopters fly S.A.R."from    
 dawn to dusk".The aircraft are all    
 kitted out to deal with emergencies   
 with first aid gear and equipment for 
 a diver.On the wheels of the Wessex is
 a pack containing an inflatable bag in
 case the helicopter has to land on    
 water in an emergency.It will keep it 
 afloat long enough for the crew to get
 out.Night missions or long distances  
 are usually flown by Sea Kings.       
 Culdrose helicopters flew to help at  
 the recent schoolboys disaster at     
 Lands End and the Air India crash off 
 Ireland.                              </content>
