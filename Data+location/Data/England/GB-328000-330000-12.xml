		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY Old Oswestry</title>
		<content> Excavation has been limited so        
 information   is also limited as to   
 its date and purpose. However         
 it is thought to date from at least   
 one hundred years B.C. when the local 
 chieftain would have protected his    
 tribe, livestock, and crops from      
 difficult neighbours. Itis believed   
 that the whole earthwork had been     
 completed and abandoned before the    
 Roman Invasion of Great Britain in    
 A.D.43.                               
                                       
 To-day it is grassed over and the     
 grass cut at least once a week in     
 summer.Many tree stumps remain from   
 the time of the first world war when  
 Lord Harlech sold off the wood for    
 national needs.In spring it is covered
 in bluebells.
