		<content>  The school was moved from old        
 Victorian buildings to the present    
 purpose_built premises in 1968.It was 
 intended to cater for six classes,but 
 there have only ever been five.The    
{staff of five teachers (including a   
{teaching head)}has responsibility     
 for about{125 pupils.}Two other       
 members of staff ( school secretary   
 and cleaner_in_charge) and two 'dinner
 ladies' are also employed.            
                                       
                                       
   Work for the 'Domesday Project' was 
 carried out mainly by Class 1 under a 
 temporary supply teacher,during the   
 Head's secondment,but all other       
 members of staff helped on the        
 information_gathering excursions.     
 Completed work was edited and         
 transferred to disc by Mrs.A.Jones.
