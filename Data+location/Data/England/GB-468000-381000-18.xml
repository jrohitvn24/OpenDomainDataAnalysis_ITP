		<title>18The Ecology of the Canal 2</title>
		<content>  The central zone of the canal habitat
 can be described as a{linear }        
{conservation}area.It is a{living zoo} 
 without cages,animals are free to go  
 where they want.                      
 The canal zone sometimes grows when   
 the{canal floods}.This causes three   
 large ponds to form which provide a   
 wet{habitat}for amphibians and        
 insects.                              
 Oil is the chief{pollutant}that these 
 animals have to fight against.{People}
 who go 'newting' disturb the mud which
 mingles with the oil .The animals     
 avoid the black sludge at all costs.  
 The effects of increasing housing     
 development,industrial pollutants and 
 the attentions of people, are the most
 important factors in the survival of  
 the canal zone's wildlife.Learning    
 about wildlife should  help to make   
 people more aware of animal needs.    </content>
