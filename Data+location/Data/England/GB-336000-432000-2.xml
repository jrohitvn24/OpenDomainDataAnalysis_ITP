{Turn-out}in elections is 30-40%       
{Public attendance}at council meetings 
 is very small; but there are usually  
 30-40 at the parish meeting in March. 
                                       
 The council has accepted              
 responsibility for the maintenance of 
 open spaces and bus shelters. It is   
 organising the construction of a      
 children's playground. It would like  
 to see a part-time doctor's surgery   
 established in the village and hopes  
 to provide an additional bus to take  
 villagers into the nearby towns for   
 shopping expeditions.                 </content>
