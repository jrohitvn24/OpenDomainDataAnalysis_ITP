		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF HINXWORTH</title>
		<content> The area around the villages of       
 Hinxworth and Edworth is first class  
 agricultural land. The landscape is   
 very flat and Dutch Elm disease in the
 1970's killed most of the large old   
 trees leaving only a few oaks. The    
 population of the area numbers about  
 400 most of whom have to travel to    
 work elsewhere.  It is a popular area 
 because of its friendly village atmos-
 phere. It is very difficult for young 
 people to buy properties here as all  
 the small old cottages have been con- 
 verted into large homes. We have virt-
 ually no amenities and so social life 
 tends to be centred around the pub,   
 the church and the village hall.Little
 building has been allowed so the vill-
 age does not change much. We no longer
 have a village shop and many think the
 village is stagnating although        
 not all are displeased by the idea.   </content>
