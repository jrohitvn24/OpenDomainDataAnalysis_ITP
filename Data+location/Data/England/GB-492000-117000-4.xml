		<content> The Rustics began in 1950.  Each play 
 needs about 20 people including the   
 producer, lights man, costumier,      
 make-up artist, but about 50 are      
 needed for musicals.  They are always 
 nervous but it adds to the            
 excitement.  They rehearse twice a    
 week for 3 months and then daily for  
 2 weeks prior to the show.  The operas
 are more popular.  They audition and  
 the costumes are made or hired and    
 they alter them if they are not liked.
  They prefer the more elaborate       
 costumes. They have to measure        
 carefully when hiring and have        
 problems fitting big men.  They apply 
 the make-up at home if it is easy but 
 an expert does the complicated ones.  
 A committee is in charge and makes    
 decisions.  In the interval they sell 
 coffee and organge juice.
