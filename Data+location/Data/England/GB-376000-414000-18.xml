		<title>18HOLCOMBE HUNT AND GAME SHOW</title>
		<content> The{Holcombe Hunt}is one of the oldest
 in the country, being established over
 300 years ago, when the district was  
 almost entirely forest. The kennels   
 were formerly in Holcombe but are now 
 at Kirkless, Tottington.              
 The{Holcombe Old English Game Fowl   }
 Club is claimed to be one of the      
 oldest clubs of its kind in the       
 country. On{New Years Day}each year it
 stages a game fowl show, which        
 attracts entries from all over the    
 country. The event used to be held at 
 The Shoulder of Mutton Hotel in       
{Holcombe village}but this venue became
 too small and so the show moved to The
 Rose and Crown Hotel which also became
 too small to hold this popular        
 event.It is now held in The Old Dun   
 Horse.
