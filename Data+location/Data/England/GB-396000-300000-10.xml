		<title>10St Thomas's church,Mossley</title>
		<content> St Thomas's church is in the parish of
 All Saints,Bloxwich,and is a small but
 modern church built in 1959 for the   
 residents of the Mossley Estate.Inside
 the building there is a multi-purpose 
 hall which converts into a church when
 the partition is drawn back behind    
 which are choir pews,litany desk,organ
 and altar with a cross of Christ.About
 70 people attend the church.There are 
 2 services on Sunday,from 11.00 to    
 midday and from 6.30 to 7.30.Communion
 service begins with a hymn,followed by
 the Collect,readings from the Bible,a 
 sermon,prayers,the Offertory and      
 finally the Eucharistic Feast.There is
 a Sunday School for children during   
 this.Although licensed to do so 18    
 months ago,there have been no weddings
 as people tend to prefer the older    
 parish church.On average 3 baptisms   
 are performed monthly.                </content>
