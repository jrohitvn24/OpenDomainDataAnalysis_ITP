		<title>09Attitudes to life in Wray</title>
		<content> On Thursday June 6th, 1985, I         
 interviewed seven people about their  
 attitudes towards life in Wray and    
 collected the following information.  
 They all enjoy living in the village  
 because the people are friendly and   
 helpful but don't interfere. They like
 to be part of a community where       
 everyone knows everyone else, and they
 especially like the countryside.      
 They all agreed that the village      
 should have its own school, but there 
 were differing opinions as to whether 
 there should be more entertainment for
 children in Wray. Some thought an     
 adventure playground would be a good  
 idea, but others believed that        
 children should find their own        
 entertainment.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
