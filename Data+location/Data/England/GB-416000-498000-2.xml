		<title>02A day in the life of Neil.</title>
		<content> Each Sunday at 9am my mum wakes me up.
 I get out of bed, get dressed, and    
 have a bowl of Shreddies. After I have
 washed and cleaned my teeth I tidy my 
 room. My dad calls my brother and me  
 and we all run the two miles to{      
{Catterick Garrison Stadium}.Once there
 we do exercises then get into two     
 groups, sprinters and endurance. Being
 in the endurance group, I run a few   
 600m laps,after which I jog around and
 do something on my own.When we finish,
 mum drives us home in our car. I have 
 a bath with my brother and we play    
 with my BBC micro-computer until      
 Sunday lunch is ready. After lunch we 
 go back to the computer until it is   
 time for tea. After tea we all settle 
 down to watch television together. At 
 about 10pm I clean my teeth and go to 
 bed. School tomorrow!
