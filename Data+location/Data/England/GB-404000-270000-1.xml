		<content> The people mainly say there is a good 
 community life, except for the younger
 people who have just moved in.  This  
 is because of a sort of rift between  
 the inhabitants of the village.  The  
 ones who have lived for 27-45 years,  
 since housing was cheap, are very     
 involved in community life, but the   
 people who have only lived there for 3
 monhs to 3 years take no part because 
 all their friends, jobs etc are in the
 towns.  They only have their houses in
 the village.  Apart from that there is
 the village council and W I comittees 
 etc.
