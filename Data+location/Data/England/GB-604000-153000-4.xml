		<content> Shottenden is a small hamlet situated 
 on the Downs some three miles north   
 west of Chilham. It is only approached
 along narrow country lanes. When the  
 snow comes in the winter the lanes are
 quickly filled and the snow plough is 
 needed to keep the roads open.        
 Sometimes the school coach cannot get 
 through.In the main part of the       
 village there are several houses.     
 There is a post office which sells    
 sweets, tinned and frozen food as well
 as stamps, and a post box and a       
 telephone box. There is a pub in the  
 village called the Plough and this is 
 down by the main crossroads. There are
 one or two small groups of council    
 houses but there are several farms and
 cottages.Much of the land surrounding 
 the village is farmland. The farms    
 keep livestock and grow crops and     
 fruit.                                </content>
