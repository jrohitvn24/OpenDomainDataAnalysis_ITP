		<content> Mrs.M.has been living in Aston for 50 
 yrs.There were not so many houses in  
 those days,you could walk for miles   
 without ever coming across a house.   
 Everyone knew each others business,   
 most housewives  were at home all day 
 but not now.When the old school was   
 declared unsafe, the villagers raised 
 money for the new building.Mrs.M.     
 became school cook by accident.The    
 headmaster found the new cook in tears
 and asked Mrs.M.to help.She said she  
 didn't know what to do either,and her 
 husband said "Only temporary".She rem-
 ained for 25 yrs.Another time she res-
 cued a plucked chicken left for dead  
 in the road.She took it home on her   
 bike,knitted it a jacket,fed it on    
 brandy and oats and it lived to a ripe
 old age!At Christmas,a tractor pulling
 a trailer of carol singers tour Aston.
