		<content> Leamington and Warwick is a very      
 residential area and is not heavily   
 industrialised. Warwick has a very    
 large and beautiful castle. Leamington
 Spa has one of the fifteen            
 largest cinemas in England. Leamington
 also has the Pump Rooms which are     
 useful. Leamington got its title      
 because of an under ground spring     
 which is supposed to be good for      
 you and is very salty. Leamington also
 has a very good shopping area. Warwick
 has a park which has a swimming pool +
 a paddling pool for small children and
 two tennis courts. The park is called 
 St. Nicholas' Park.In 1843 Queen      
 Victoria visited Leamington and had a 
 statue built of her and in the Second 
 World War a bomb displased the statue 
 1 inch off the base.On the bottom of  
 the statue there is a plaque telling  
 you about it.                         </content>
