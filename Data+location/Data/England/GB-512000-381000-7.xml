		<content>    The building material used in the  
 past in this area was mud and stud,   
 i.e., mud plastered onto a timber     
 frame with upright palings fixed      
 between the main timbers. None of the 
 present houses show this building     
 method externally, though some of the 
 early cottages in{West Torrington}    
 probably were made in this way, but   
 they are now faced with local brick,  
 and have pantile, not thatched roofs. 
 Later houses, including some larger   
 farm houses, are made of local brick, 
 but have had slate roofs added, while 
 later nineteenth and early twentieth  
 century houses are made of non-local  
 brick with Welsh slate roofs. Later   
 twentieth century are made of non-    
 local materials,including the pantiles
 which are now re-appearing on new     
 houses.
