		<title>12 Stubbers Green, Aldridge</title>
		<content> Stubbers Green is an area of old mine 
 and clay workings which over the years
 has become naturalised. It is a large 
 stretch of land covered with ponds,   
 streams and other points of interest. 
 If I had my way I would try to        
 preserve Stubbers Green as there are  
 lots of wild animals there and if it  
 was changed the would probably die out
 as they would have no where else to   
 live. Although Stubbers Green is a    
 wonderful place it could be better as 
 there is pollution in some of the     
 streams. The largest pond is used by  
 Aldridge Sailing Club. On both ponds  
 moorhens and coots are nesting and on 
 the smaller pond swans have nested for
 several years. If the council built   
 upon this land it would be a shame and
 a lot of animals and plants would be  
 in danger.
