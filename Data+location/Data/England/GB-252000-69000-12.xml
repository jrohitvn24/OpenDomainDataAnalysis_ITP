		<content>  1.WALKHAMPTON-HOW OLD ARE THE CARS?  
 There were forty modern{cars}(after   
 1975),thirty cars between 1965 and    
 1975 and seven older cars;before 1965.
   Many{commercial}vehicles are used.We
 saw some old cars being renovated.    
   The tar roads are narrow with no    
 markings.There are also few caravans  
 around.Most of the drives are made of 
 gravel and stone.The streets are very 
{clean}and there is scarcely any       
 litter.                               
   There is a{minibus}service which is 
 called "The Dartmoor Pony" and runs   
 every hour to Walkhampton. This local 
 service connects the local villages   
 with the Western National main bus    
 services at Yelverton.                
   This service is more convenient than
 a double decker service based on      
 Plymouth. You need one{ticket}to use  
 both buses.                           </content>
