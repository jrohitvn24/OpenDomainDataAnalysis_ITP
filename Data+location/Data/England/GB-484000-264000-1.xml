		<title>01 Introduction to the Area</title>
		<content> The main occupation is agricultural   
mixed farming with crops of cereals,   
potatoes and oil seed rape combined    
with the rearing of cattle and sheep. A
notable feature in May is the large    
number of fields covered in bright     
yellow oil seed rape flowers. In the NW
corner is the edge of{ Mears Ashby}    
village and in the SW corner are the   
northern outskirts of{ Earls Barton}   
consisting mainly of an industrial     
estate comprising factories &amp;          
workshops.The edge of{ Doddington}     
village lies in the SE of the area. The
principal village is{ Wilby} which     
stretches along a main road &amp; is       
separated from{ Wellingborough} by a   
roundabout &amp; a field. It has a shop,a  
school, a Working Men's Club and two   
public houses.Although the main road   
divides the village in two it still    
retains its village atmosphere.        </content>
