		<title>01Bawdeswell and Sparham</title>
		<content> The area is rural in nature with two  
 villages located on the northern side 
 of the only major road, the A1067     
 Norwich to Fakenham road. Bawdeswell, 
 the larger of the two villages, is    
 some 18 miles west of the city of     
 Norwich and stands higher than the    
 rest of the area, most of which is in 
 the Wensum Valley. Bawdeswell has been
 enlarged recently by modern housing   
 developments, whereas nearby Sparham  
 still comprises established farms and 
 residences centred around the village 
 church. Although mainly an            
 agricultural area, several light      
 industries are discreetly present     
 providing local employment.           
 Worthy of note are large houses namely
 Sparham Hall and Sparham House built  
 in the 19'th century, and Bawdeswell  
 Hall built in the 17'th century, owner
 occupied for several generations.     </content>
