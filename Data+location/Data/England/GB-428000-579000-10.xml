		<title>10CHANGES AT ISABELLA COLLIERY</title>
		<content>  In 1966 the Isabella pit closed down 
 and it is now difficult to realise    
 that coal was mined there.The pitheap 
 has been landscaped. All the old      
 colliery houses were pulled down in   
 1982 and the first row of new houses  
 and flats have been completed.        
   Mrs. Bowart, whose husband was a    
 miner, moved to Isabella in 1956 and  
 remembers it as a village surrounded  
 by fields. Her first house in West Row
 had no water or electricity, the tap  
 and lavatory being outside. The family
 bathed in a tin bath in front of the  
 fire. Her second house , in New Row,  
 had a sitting room, kitchenette, three
 bedrooms, bathroom, electricity and an
 outside lavatory.Last year she moved  
 into her new two_bedroomed,gas_       
 centrally heated flat in West Court   
 (where West Row used to be).She likes 
 it but preferred her house in New Row.</content>
