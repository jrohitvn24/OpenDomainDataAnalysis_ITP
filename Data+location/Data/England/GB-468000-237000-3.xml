There are two full-time craftsmen, one 
in L. Dayrell who makes wrought iron   
pieces, another in Akeley who creates  
one-off' machines.  At home all kinds 
of crafts are produced:  women knit,   
sew, make patchwork, lace, paint etc.  
Most men become adept in do-it-your-  
self', a way of improving home and     
garden, attempting skilled jobs, such  
as bricklaying and plumbing.  Children 
are taught to be creative and produce  
things' from egg boxes and scraps.    
They are encouraged to enjoy this with-
out worry about mess.  Mothers are     
often required to dress their offspring
as witches, goblins, fairies, trees,   
rabbits, depending on current school   
drama and they rise to the challenge.
