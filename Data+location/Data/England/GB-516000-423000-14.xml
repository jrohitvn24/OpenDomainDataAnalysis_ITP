		<title>14A day in the life of.</title>
		<content> I had to get up and go to school.I    
 flew out of the door and ran like mad 
 to school.I didnt stop to call for my 
 friend Anthony Parker who lives in    
 Leonards Close.I made it in a couple  
 of minutes and had time to play for 5 
 minutes.After we went into school I   
 started work on the Domesday          
 Project.As the minutes ticked by it   
 was soon playtime.We left our work and
 wet out to play rugby.I tackled Tony  
 Turner my friend on the half way line 
 and we both slid in front of our teams
 try line but Bob Everitt stopped us   
 from sliding over it.We played rugby  
 for another 5 minutes then it was     
 in_time so we went in to do some      
 work.At half past 11 the infant class 
 started singing songs about food and  
 it made the whole class feel hungry.  
 We all had to starve  until dinner    
 time.                                 </content>
