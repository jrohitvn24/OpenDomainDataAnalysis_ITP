		<title>03Recreation in Wilton</title>
		<content>    In Wilton area there is not enough 
 sport or recreation organised.        
    From a{survey of pupils}at{Wilton  
{Middle School}and of people in Wilton 
 it was found that many people played  
 sports. Many playing at the school    
 which has a{gymnasium.}The gym is     
 used by the{youth football team}for   
 training and by the{Wilton Badminton  
{Club.}A few people played{squash}at   
 the larger sports complex at Westwood 
{St. Thomas Upper School.              
    Wilton needs its own public        
 swimming pool.                        
    There is one{youth club}in Wilton  
 and it only meets once a week on a    
 Thursday.                             
    The public said we needed more     
 tennis, but only 5 out of 50 said they
 belonged to the{tennis club.          
    We want a better park for younger  
 children.                             </content>
