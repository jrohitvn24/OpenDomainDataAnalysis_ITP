		<content>   My family usually gets up at 8.00a.m
Mum goes to Nanny's and they go        
shopping.Sandra goes straight to work  
and Clare and I go and watch T.V.      
Sometimes dad goes to work but if he   
doesn't he does jobs around the house. 
My mum,nanny and myself usually go to  
Hemel or Watford or go to my aunties.  
When we return we have tea,sit down and
watch T.V.and then go to bed.          
    On Sunday we get up at 7.00 .We    
have our breakfast and then get ready  
for Church.We go to church as a family.
Then we come home for dinner and in the
afternoon we go and visit relatives.We 
usually go for a walk along the Canal  
with their dog and then come back and  
have tea.We then drive home for me to  
go to bed at 9.00p.m.
