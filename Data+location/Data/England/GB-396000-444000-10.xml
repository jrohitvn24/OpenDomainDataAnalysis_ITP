		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>   On a Monday I usually get up at     
 7-0'clock.After brushing my hair I    
 have a wash.As we go swimming on a    
 Monday I get my swimming things ready 
 the night before.After a wash,I dress,
 have my breakfast,usually rice-       
 crispies.The taxi takes us from the   
 top of our track to school.           
   At 9-0'clock we have Assembly and at
 9.30am.we go to Aireville Swimming    
 Baths in Skipton.When we arrive back  
 we do Maths until dinner-time.        
   Some people bring a packed lunch but
 I have a school dinner.My favourite   
 meal is sausages and chips with       
 shortcake and custard to follow.      
   If the weather is good we go to the 
 Recreation Ground to play.We also have
 sewing until play-time.After play-time
 we carry on for a while then our      
 teacher reads us 'Heidi' until home-  
 time.                                 </content>
