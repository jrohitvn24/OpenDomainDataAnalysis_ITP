  ALL RURAL COMMUNITIES RELY HEAVILY ON
 THE LARGE TOWNS FOR SERVICES AND      
 EMPLOYMENT OF ALL TYPES. THERE IS NOW 
 CONSIDERABLE CONCERN OVER THE FUTURE  
 OF H.M.DOCKYARDS AND ASSOCIATED       
 FACILITIES IN PLYMOUTH WHICH PROVIDE  
 MANY JOBS.PERVERSELY FEW SUPPORT MOVES
 TO JOIN E.CORNWALL WITH PLYMOUTH.     
 CORNWALL IS GENERALLY SEEN AS BEING   
 UNIQUE AND SEPARATE FROM PLYMOUTH,    
 DESPITE CENTRALISATION OF ESSENTIAL   
 SERVICES.THE TELEPHONE AND HOSPITAL   
 SERVICES RELUCTANCE TO RECOGNISE THIS 
 SOCIAL NEED IS REGRETTED.             
   THE INFORMATION ON THIS BLOCK HAS   
 BEEN COLLATED BY THE DOWNDERRY AND    
 SEATON RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION.THERE   
 WILL BE SOME OVERLAP WITH THE THREE   
 ADJACENT BLOCKS WITH WHOM ALL SOCIAL  
 EVENTS AND AMENITIES ARE SHARED.
