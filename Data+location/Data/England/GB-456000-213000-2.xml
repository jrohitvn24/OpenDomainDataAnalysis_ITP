		<title>02OTMOOR - A RECENT HISTORY</title>
		<content>Prior to the land's enclosure in the   
early 1800's the local population      
enjoyed unrestricted grazing rights.   
These were lost subsequently and the   
famous Otmoor Riots of 1830 did little 
to reverse the situation.Waggon-making,
thatching,quarrying and farming were   
the major employers of the time.Fields 
on the moor were given names that      
suggest they were of local origin.Being
close to Oxford many people take       
advantage of the area's unique         
environment.It is used for many        
pursuits besides farming including     
riding,ornithology,nature study and    
walking.Despite drainage projects that 
have taken place the land has been     
little improved and remains primarily  
grazing land with some mixed farming   
at the fringes.Controversial plans to  
route the M40 Motorway extenion across 
the area are currently under review.   </content>
