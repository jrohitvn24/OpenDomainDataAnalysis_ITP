		<title>20THE HEADLESS CORPSE.</title>
		<content> Chilton Cantelo has a wordwide and    
 rather macabre claim to fame. A man   
 called Theophilus Broome was a        
 Roundhead during the Civil War in     
 the 17th century. He was wounded in   
 a battle between the Roundheads and   
 Cavaliers which took place on Babylon 
 Hill near Yeovil. Although wounded he 
 managed to get to his sister's house, 
 Higher Farm, Chilton Cantelo. Before  
 he died he made a strange request. He 
 asked his brother-in-law to cut off   
 his head after his death and keep it  
 forever in the house where it still   
 remains. His body is buried in the    
 only grave in the church. There are   
 various legends concerning the        
 attempts to bury the head with the    
 body and it is said that when the     
 skull is disturbed the effects can be 
 disastrous. The villagers like to     
 ensure the skulls peace.              </content>
