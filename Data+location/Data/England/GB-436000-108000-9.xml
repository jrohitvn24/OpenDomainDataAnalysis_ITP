		<title>09Parish clerk,Marchwood</title>
		<content> The {Parish clerk} is not elected like
 the parish councillors.She does her   
 job as a paid employee.In many ways,  
 she runs the village.She acts as      
 secretary at all the parish           
 meetings.If local people write to her 
 with complaints like the smell from   
 the incinerator or the sewage works,it
 is her job to write to the appropriate
 authority to persuade them to do      
 something about it.                   
     Also she has to keep the parish   
 accounts up to date and make sure they
 are kept as accurately as possible.   
     If any decisions are made by the  
 parish council, it is the clerk's job 
 to make sure that they are carried    
 out.                                  
  If anyone wants to build anything in 
 Marchwood,permission has to be        
 sought,and it is the clerk's job to   
 check that everything is done properly</content>
