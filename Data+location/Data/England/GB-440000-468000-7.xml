		<title>07MY HOUSE - A NEW ONE.</title>
		<content> My house is brand new.We moved in     
 in January 1985.It is made of old     
 bricks to fit in with the village.    
 The inner walls are breeze-blocks     
 and plaster.The house has sixteen     
 rooms including built in cupboards    
 and toilets.The rooms are two         
 bathrooms,five bedrooms,one cloakroom 
 with toilet on the hall,one study,one 
 hall cupboard,one sitting room,one    
 playroom and a kitchen.Also it has two
 garages.We have central heating       
 radiators powered by oil and we have  
 two coal fires.The garden is quite    
 big.Big enough to play in.The village 
 is much safer than my old village and 
 has more places to play securely.
