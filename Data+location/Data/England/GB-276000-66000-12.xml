		<title>12Transport in Landscove</title>
		<content> The iron rings still in evidence on   
 the school wall tell us that children 
 once rode their{ponies}to the         
 school.Those would be the lucky       
 children most would have to{walk}some 
 coming two or three miles along muddy 
 tracks and lanes to get here.         
 Mr.Warren remembers that most farmers 
 had ponies and 'traps' for their      
 personal transport in the twenties and
 most went into Totnes or Ashburton for
 special business and cars were seldom 
 seen,just one or two in the           
 towns.There was a station a Staverton 
 which also was served by 4{trains     
 daily to Buckfastleigh,Totnes,and     
 Plymouth.Many Landscove people used   
 the train for pleasure trips as well  
 as business.After the war better pay  
 meant more people bought{cars}and the 
 railway was used less ,fewer trains   
 ran ,finally the line closed .        </content>
