		<title>10ARMTHORPE &amp; MINERS' STRIKE</title>
		<content>{HOW IT BEGAN:}In March 1984 the NCB   
 decided to close Cortonwood Colliery  
 in South Yorkshire.This decision was  
 to cause one of the most serious      
 industrial disputes ever seen.        
{THE EFFECTS:}The NUM was at the time  
 committed to preventing pit closures .
 With the closure of Cortonwood the    
 Yorkshire Coalfield came to a halt. A 
 few years previously the Yorkshire    
 Miners balloted on a 2 issue ballot   
 paper.One issue was not to close any  
 uneconomic pits.The Yorkshire Miners  
 got support from all fields but Notts.
{THE VIOLENCE:}The dispute caused      
 bitter conflict between police &amp;      
 pickets because 10 men wanted to work.
 At one stage (August) Armthorpe was   
 cordoned off by police.               
{THE END:}The strike ended on May 14th 
 but Markham Main returned on 17th the 
 last Yorkshire pit to do so.          </content>
