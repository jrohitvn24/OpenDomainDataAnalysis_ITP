		<content>     Most of the residents in the area 
 are{retired}people, coming from the   
 immediate area, other parts of the    
 country, or from abroad.              
      The main source of{employment    
 is farming.                           
       Some people{travel}out of the   
 area to other farms to work.          
       A small number of people travel 
 to St.Austell, Bodmin and other       
 centres in Cornwall to work each day. 
 They rely on their own transport to   
 travel to and from work.              
       A few people work in the area as
{shopkeepers, publicans, marine        
{engineers}and{teachers.               
       Young people, on leaving school,
 find it difficult to gain employment  
 locally, but under the{Youth Training 
{Scheme,}some are given jobs on local  
 farms.                                
                                       </content>
