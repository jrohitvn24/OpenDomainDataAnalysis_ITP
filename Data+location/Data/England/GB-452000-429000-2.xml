		<title>02 GASCOIGNE WOOD COAL MINE</title>
		<content> Gascoigne Wood coal mine is situated  
 on the North West corner of our grid. 
 It got its name from the Gascoigne    
 family who owned the land, which was a
 wood.It was built in 1978 at a cost of
 1.3 billion pounds but they won't have
 completely finished it until 1989. It 
 was opened by the Duchess of Kent and 
 it is hoped that it will be re-opened 
 in 1989 by the Queen.They employ 150  
 workers, who earn 160-170 pounds a    
 week. There are 3 shifts worked,each  
 about 6-7 hours long.The miners under 
 ground have to take special safety    
 precautions.They wear brightly        
 coloured overalls to be easily seen,  
 safety helmets with a light on the    
 front which works by a battery,       
 clipped to their belt.They also have  
 self rescuers, this device is used if 
 gas is around.It gives the miner half 
 an hour to find fresh air.            </content>
