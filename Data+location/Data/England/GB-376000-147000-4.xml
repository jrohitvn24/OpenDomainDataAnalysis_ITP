		<title>04Buildings of Frome</title>
		<content> Frome consists of a great number of   
 listed buildings.  Some appear to be  
 in a bad state of disrepair, perhaps  
 the most notable being the Grade 1    
 Rook Lane Congregational Church dated 
 l707.  Many others have been          
 extensively renovated as seen in the  
 Trinity area (l670-l720). A high      
 proportion of all the listed          
 buildings date from the l8th. cent.,  
 although some are from the l7th. cent.
 and even the 20th. cent.  They  serve 
 various purposes, inc. ecclesiastical 
 &amp; residential. Although many buildungs
 retain much of their early charm, the 
 vast majority of the listed ones have 
 either been remodelled or altered     
 since being constructed.  The Bridge, 
 widened &amp; reconstructed in l82l is    
 particularly striking with its shops.
