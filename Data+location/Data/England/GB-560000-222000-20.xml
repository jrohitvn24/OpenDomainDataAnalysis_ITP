		<title>20A DAY IN MY LIFE.SAM KELLY 6</title>
		<content> The birds in my loft wake me up in the
 morning and sometimes my watch wakes  
 me.I put on my shorts a shirt and a   
 jumper and trainers and socks.When I  
 go down to breakfast I mostly have    
 toast and marmalade and a cup of tea. 
 I brush my hair and pack my bag and go
 to the bus_stop and get on the school 
 bus.When I get to school,I hang my    
 coat on my peg then I walk up the     
 coridoor and to the class.I do my news
 and my number work until dinner time.I
 mostly have a burger and a bun.After  
 dinner we go out to play for 1 hour,I 
 like to play football or in the sand  
 pit.After playtime we go swimming and 
 I do a length with a float!Then we get
 dressed and go back to class we put up
 our chairs and we sit down for a story
 Then we say our prayers and get our   
 coats.I get the bus which takes me    
 home and then I go out to play.       </content>
