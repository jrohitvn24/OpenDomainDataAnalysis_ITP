		<title>05The Hills around Dulverton</title>
		<content>      The area has a lot of quiet      
 valleys and slopes which are wooded in
 places and not in others.             
      The hills in October can be      
 bathed in sunshine and the only loud  
 noise is a stag roaring his challenge.
 Later in the year the same hills can  
 be covered in snow several feet deep  
 and travel is made very difficult with
 icy conditions.When heavy rains fall, 
 soil can get washed off fields into   
 the river that grows larger until it  
 floods.                               
      The wildlife in our wooded       
 valleys includes red deer, badgers,   
 foxes, rabbits, woodpeckers and there 
 are dippers down by the river.
