		<title>08Housing In The Harrowdens.</title>
		<content>   There is a great variety of housing 
in the villages.There are large        
detached residences, cottages, semi    
detached residences, terraced          
houses,bungalows and Â£estate type'     
houses.                                
    The majority of the houses are     
privately owned but there are some     
council rented houses built since 1945.
In addition there are some old peoples 
sheltered houses with a warden in      
charge.                                
    Not only does the age and type of  
housing vary but also the type of      
building materials used.The older      
detached residences and several of the 
cottages are built out of the          
Northamptonshire Iron Stone.Some of the
cottages have been built out of a      
mixture of stone and brick and then    
rendered on the outside.
