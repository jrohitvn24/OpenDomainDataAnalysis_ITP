		<title>04Tourism, Caravans: Pateley</title>
		<content>  Tourism creates a great deal of      
 employment in this area. One of the   
 amenities needed by tourists is a     
 caravan site. We have two large ones: 
 one by the river Nidd in Pateley      
 Bridge and one up by Heathfield.      
  The site near Pateley is run as a    
 family business and covers an area of 
 ten acres. One of the jobs on the site
 is to book in the campers as they     
 arrive. It is also necessary to make  
 sure the campsite is tidy and to      
 answer any questions the campers may  
 ask. The site is used by families who 
 enjoy the scenery and the walks around
 here. Walkers or hikers, who are      
 walking the Yorkshire Way, sometimes  
 stay overnight. There are two areas in
 the campsite. One is for static       
 caravans, which are there all year    
 round, and the other is for people who
 come with their own tents or caravans.</content>
