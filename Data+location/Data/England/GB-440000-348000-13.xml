                       {(Age 10)       
   My dad gets up at 7.30am to go to   
 work and I get up at 8am to make my   
 mum egg on toast for her breakfast.My 
 brother makes a cup of tea.We have our
 breakfast and then at 10am I go       
 ballroom dancing with my partner Ben  
 Cork. We have won lots of medals for  
 dancing. When I come back at 11am I   
 help my mum with the housework till   
 noon when we get dinner ready. My dad 
 comes home from work and says "You can
 definitely have your pocket money!" I 
 cheer and run up and down.            
   After dinner we go out to Ripley to 
 do the shopping. Then I help to make  
 the tea with my mum. After tea we go  
 out. My brother and I have a drink of 
 pop and some sweets and crisps, and my
 mum and dad have a drink of beer. Then
 at 11pm my brother and I go to bed.{SR</content>
