 As far back as Saxon Times use was    
 made of the dramatic drop in the river
 at Beetham.                           
 Heron Corn Mill was rebuilt in        
 seventeen-forty. The miller and his   
 two sons ran it. It is now a working  
 museum that closes  in the Winter,but 
 the curator is prepared to open any   
 time if the party raises a minimum of 
 five pounds.                          
 The busiest time of the year is in    
 the childrens Summer holidays. the    
 mill is built of local stone and has  
 been carefully maintained.            
 Up on the top floor is a fantastic    
 working model of three different      
 water wheels. When the same flow of   
 water is passed over them we see that 
 the wheel with the greatest radius    
 moves the most.                       </content>
