		<title>14GRASSLAND ON ARNE PENINSULA</title>
		<content>   The area of improved pasture forms a
 very small amount of the surveyed area
 which is farmed.It is sown with a     
 commercial mixture of rye grass and   
 other species,improved by the         
 application of fertilizer and used for
 the production of silage and for      
 winter grazing,but the Arne Farm is a 
 small one of 100 acres and land use   
 for agriculture is not intensive.     
   Examination of this improved        
 grassland shows at once how the       
 species diversity decreases and the   
 typical calcifuge vegetation of       
 heathers seen on the acid heaths is   
 destroyed.However the destruction     
 of large areas of lowland heath in    
 Dorset in the last century is due to  
 urbanisation and open cast mining for 
 sand and gravel rather than the       
 encroachment of agriculture.
