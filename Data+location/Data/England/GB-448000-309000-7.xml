		<content> It is June 17th and it is my dad's    
 first day in his new shop. The shop is
 called the Mace but we are changing it
 to Mac's Foodmarket. It is 5.30a.m.   
 and we are at Loughborough Warehouse. 
 We have got a lot of greengrocery and 
 some potatoes. We then go to          
 Thurcaston to fetch our new butcher.  
 We fetch the meat and take it back to 
 the shop to chop up. My dad and the   
 butcher tried to get a sheep through  
 the door but it got stuck.I will help 
 my dad whenever I can.
