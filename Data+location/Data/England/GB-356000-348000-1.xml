		<title>01Dairy Farming S. of Chorley</title>
		<content> The whole area is dairy farming, about
 25% of the area is owned by           
 Cholmondeley Estate Co. the remainder 
 are owner occupied. The area is very  
 intensive, usually farmers claim for 1
 to 1.25 cows per acre. Milk quota have
 curtailed futher output. Average farm 
 size is about 100 acres. Artificial   
 fertilizers are used in large         
 quantities up to 350 units per acre.  
 During the summer, cow grazing is     
 controlled by electric fencing, silage
 is made for winter feeding. very      
 little hay made because of the        
 weather. Cows are now found in        
 cubicles rather than traditional      
 shippons. The predominant breed is    
 "British Fresian" although Holstein   
 fresians are increasing.
