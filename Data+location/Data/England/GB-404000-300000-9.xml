		<title>09 Ibstock Bricks, Aldridge</title>
		<content> The Brick and Tile business in        
 Aldridge began because of vast        
 deposits of Etruria marl found in the 
 area. This brickmaking company was    
 founded in 1874 and is the only one   
 still working in Aldridge in 1985, now
 called "Ibstock Brick Aldridge Ltd."  
 The factory produces 750,000 bricks of
 20 different types each week, with    
 prices between Â£100 and Â£170 for      
 1,000. A large majority of the        
 products are used in civic            
 developments, fire stations and public
 buildings. The company owns about 100 
 acres of clay bearing land. Marl is   
 dug out of the quarry and through     
 grinding processes is reduced from    
 lumps to dust, which is taken to the  
 Making department. Here it is mixed   
 with water, formed into brick shape,  
 extruded and cut into single bricks   
 which are fired, then are cooled.     </content>
