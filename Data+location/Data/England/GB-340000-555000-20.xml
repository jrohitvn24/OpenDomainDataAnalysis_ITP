		<content> All the data was collected by 2nd and 
 3rd Year pupils and History staff of  
 St Aidan's, which is one of four mixed
 comprehensive schools located in our  
 survey area. The largest, Trinity, has
 1700 pupils; Eden is the smallest with
 300 and no sixth form. St Aidan's has 
 about 1100 pupils with 100 in the     
 sixth form. The fourth school, Newman,
 has 650 pupils.                       
 Seventy full and part-time teachers   
 work at St Aidan's. Most are graduates
 and all have pastoral as well as acad-
 emic duties. The School has financed  
 and developed its own residential cen-
 tre in Little Langdale, which figures 
 in a comprehensive fieldwork programme
 The most recent curricular innovation 
 is TVEI, funded by MSC. Falling rolls 
 and a proposed Sixth Form College are 
 St Aidan's main concerns for the      
 immediate future.                     </content>
