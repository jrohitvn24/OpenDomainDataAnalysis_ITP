		<title>20FARM SURVEY, THWAITES (2)</title>
		<content> Although none of the farms surveyed   
 grow a significant quantity of crops, 
 they all do grow grass for hay and    
 silage. 80% grow grass for both       
 purposes, 20% for one or the other.   
 All the farms use the hay and         
 silage they make themselves and do not
 sell any. Although the farms all deal 
 in one type of livestock farming or   
 another, there is no predominant breed
 of animal kept except for dairy cows  
 which are  mostly Fresian. Ulverston  
 Auction is used for the sale of       
 livestock by all of the farmers. 60%  
 use Broughton as well, which is the   
 nearest to our area, 20% use Kendal,  
 and 10% use Lancaster. 70% of the     
 farms keep hens. 20% of the farms make
 some butter from their milk.
