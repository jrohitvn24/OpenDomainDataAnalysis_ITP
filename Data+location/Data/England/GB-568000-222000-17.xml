		<title>17  THE A120</title>
		<content>   The A120 starts at Colchester and   
 passes through Coggeshall,Rayne       
 and,finishing at St Albans. The A120  
 is a Roman road originally named Stane
 Lane. The road is very fast with a    
 speed limit of 60mph. There is however
 a 30mph limit going through the       
 village of Rayne but this is not      
 observed and many villagers are       
 worried. In this area the A120 has    
 a grass verge on one side and a narrow
 pavement on the other. The A120 is    
 heavily used by container lorries     
 because of this the road is very      
 noisy. It is a not a very wide road,  
 being only a single lane carriageway. 
 The A120 provides much trade for the  
 Saling Oak which is sited at Blake    
 End. The Pub has a Diner which caters 
 especilly for the drivers.
