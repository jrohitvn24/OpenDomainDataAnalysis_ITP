		<title>11THE HOUSE AT HUNTS FARM</title>
		<content>      The house at{Hunts Farm}is       
 Elizabethan.  It and the farm are     
 owned by Paul and Jeffery Pratt.      
      In one room there used to be some
 back stairs.  They thought at one     
 point that there was a ghost because a
 poodle used to look up where the      
 stairs were.                          
      They think that the front of the 
 house was added to the back.  The main
 reason for this thinking was because  
 of a well found in the living room.   
 At the back is a small shed that used 
 to be a privy.  The{Hunts}had lived at
 the farm since the{15th Century.}It   
 started being used as a farm in 1781. 
 The last known{Hunt}died in New       
 Zealand in 1981.
