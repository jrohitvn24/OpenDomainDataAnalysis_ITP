		<title>19THE GEOLOGY OF LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>   Littondale is a typical U-shaped    
 valley.  It was formed by glacial     
 action.  Some of the valleys which    
 join it are tributory valleys showing 
 a typical V-shape.  This can be seen  
 in the valleys of Potts, Crystal and  
 Cowside Becks.                        
   The main rock visible in Littondale 
 is limestone.  Limestone is attacked  
 by rain, which penetrates cracks      
 eating away at the rock, making the   
 cracks wider.  These wider cracks are 
 called grikes, and the limestone      
 blocks isolated by the grikes are     
 called clints.  Together these form   
 the limestone pavements, an example of
 which can be seen over Blue Scar.     
   Erosion of the limestone over the   
 centuries helped to form caves such as
 Dowkabottom and Skosca.  Scars like   
 Blue Scar, Yew Cogar and Knipe Scars  
 are typical of limestone areas.       </content>
