		<content>{   Crown Paints}used to be called the 
 Varnish Works because it made varnish,
 but that is made at Darwen now because
 a big fire burnt down the varnish     
 kitchen.                              
    About 290 people work at Crown     
 Paints.  Scott, Karen and Michael's   
 dads work in the factory making gloss,
 and emulsion paints and other special 
 paints for blackboards, the bottom of 
 ships, and other difficult surfaces.  
 They work from 7.45am until 4.00pm.   
{   Paint}is made by mixing dry powders
 called pigments (which give the paint 
 its colours) with varnishes and       
 solvents.  The paint is mixed in high 
 speed machines, put into tanks, then  
 filled in tins by a special machine.  
 The tins are taken to the warehouse,  
 and waggons take it to Paint Shops.   
 Some paint is put on freight liners   
 and sent overseas to Saudi Arabia.    </content>
