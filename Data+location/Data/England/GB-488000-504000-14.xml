		<content> Transport is very limited on the moor 
 roads. The main road through          
 Ugglebarnby and Fylingdales Moor is   
 the B1416 Whitby to Scarboroigh road  
 which meets up with the A171. There is
 only one daily bus which serves the   
 people of this area. Littlebeck is not
 serviced by public transport because  
 of the very steep hills into the      
 village.                              
 Most people have their own transport, 
 usually a family type car or van.     
 The most popular type of transport for
 the farmer is the Land Rover, a       
 vehicle which enables him to drive to 
 the most inaccessible areas of his    
 land. Also farmers have their own     
 tractor or transport wagon for        
 conveying cattle to the market.
