		<title>08Simon's Weekend - Sunday</title>
		<content> On Sunday I got up at 7am. and fed the
 cats. I made Mummy and Daddy a cup of 
 tea and then I tucked into bed with   
 them. I had Weetabix with yoghurt for 
 breakfast.                            
  In the morning Nick, our neighbours' 
 grandson, came to play. We            
 looked in both our gardens for        
 frogs,toads and newts. Nick fell into 
 the neighbour's pond but I helped him 
 out.                                  
  We had salad and barbecued steak for 
 lunch.I made an apple crumble for     
 pudding.                              
  In the afternoon I went to the       
 Electric Palace cinema with Nick to   
 see "Never Ending Story" and "Burgers 
 and Beans". I had a cheese sandwich   
 for tea.                              
  I had a bath and then a long story   
 read by Daddy and went to bed at      
 7.30pm.                               </content>
