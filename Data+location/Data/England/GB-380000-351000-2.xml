		<title>02Around the Stone Cross,Talke</title>
		<content> We set off.First we walked up Swan    
Bank jotting down the names of houses. 
Our first stop was the stone cross     
built in 1253 AD and re-erected in 1887
AD.Mr Williams,our teacher,told us to  
sketch this.Debra took a photograph of 
Sidebottom's farm and St Martin's      
Church.Tara drew a George V1 post box. 
When we had done our work there we     
walked to the library where Simon and  
Nathan questioned the two librarians   
who were pleased to see us.There we saw
one of our teacher's fathers,Mr        
Baskerville.We set off again and walked
slowly because it was a very hot day.We
sat on the green and sketched the      
Oasis,a public house and then met a    
pigeon enthusiast on Coalpit Hill.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
