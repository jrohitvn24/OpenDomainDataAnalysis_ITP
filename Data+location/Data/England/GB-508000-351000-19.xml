		<title>19ALL SAINTS' CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The Domesday Book records that in  
 1086 Reschintone (Ruskington) there   
 lived 38 families. There appears to   
 have been a church here at that time, 
 possibly Saxon,of timber construction 
 and on the site of the present All    
 Saints' building. The tower arch is   
 Roman, circa 12th.century. The Roman  
 church was replaced later in that same
 century by yet another.  Further      
 changes and additions to the structure
 were carried out over the next 700    
 years.                                
    Church relics include an Eliza-    
 bethan register book and Burial       
 Register started in 1678. The church  
 holds the colours of the reconn-      
 aissance units of The Parachute       
 Regiment which were billeted in the   
 area prior to taking part in the      
 Battle of Arnhem. The present rector  
 is Canon Stanley Jackson.             </content>
