		<title>20Dairy Farmer's Wife's Day</title>
		<content>  My day began at 6.30 with a mug of   
tea.The 2 boys were up playing with    
Lego.I made the beds,sorted the boys'  
clothes,bags and books for school.I had
to make sandwiches and fill flasks for 
school lunchtime while they ate break- 
fast.I started the automatic washing   
machine.On my husband's return from    
milking I took the boys to school by   
car.Back at home we had breakfast and  
washed up and I hung the washing out.  
Off to the farm:I tedded hay ready for 
baling this afternoon.After lunch I    
stacked haybales in blocks of 12 as my 
husband baled them.At 3.30 met the boys
at school.The family fetched the cows  
from the field for milking.Then I pre- 
pared our evening meal,listened to the 
children read,bathtime and bed at 8.00.
  I had to fit some household chores in
before we retired.
