		<content> At 7.00pm on Tuesdays I go to the     
 Village Hall to Guides.We do all sorts
 of activities.In the summer we play   
 rounders in the garden,using the trees
 as bases.We have a Christmas Bazaar   
 which we make things for.We have an   
 open-night in July,when we sell       
 cakes,sweets and toys.We have a       
 tuck-shop every Tuesday looked after  
 by Mrs.Lucas,our Assistant-Guider.Our 
 Guider is Mrs.Lawrence and our Young  
 Leader is called Marie.We are grouped 
 into patrols named after animals and  
 flowers.Guides finishes at 8.30pm.We  
 pay 20p subscription and 5p patrol    
 funds each week.
