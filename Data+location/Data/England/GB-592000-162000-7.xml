		<title>07SITTINGBOURNE ANGLING CLUB</title>
		<content> The Sittingbourne Angling Club was    
 founded in 1954. There were originally
 just 25 members; now the membership   
 has to be limited to 500 which        
 includes 100 juniors. They fish at the
 three lakes at Murston which were     
 formerly clay-pits from the old       
 brickworks. The lakes, known as       
 Broombank, are leased to the Club by  
 F.T.Holt (Farms) Ltd. The season      
 starts on June 16th and runs through  
 until March 14th. The lakes have a    
 wide variety of freshwater fish       
 including carp, tench, bream and      
 pike. The Club holds several internal 
 competitions each year and sends teams
 to matches with other clubs. The Club 
 also has a busy social programme for  
 its membership.
