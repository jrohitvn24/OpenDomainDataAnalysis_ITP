		<title>15Rothwell Moto-Cross Track</title>
		<content>      The{Rothwell Moto-Cross Track}is 
 situated next to{Rothwell Colliery}on 
 the pit hills (black and grey shale). 
 It is used mostly by amateurs.        
      The people who go set a day and  
 plan a meeting with a whole range of  
 motorbikes, from 80 to 500 cc. A lot  
 of the beginners go on trial bikes{(DT
{175}or even{Honda C50).               
      There are some very tough courses
 or tracks, which are very dangerous.  
 Sometimes people are injured. There   
 are lots of high, steep, thin hills:  
 with a wide gauge of tyres you have to
 go up fast and straight.              
      Sometimes it can be a family     
 affair, with the fathers and sons     
 going together.                       
      A second-hand{Moto-Cross}bike can
 cost from Â£200 to Â£1000. A new one    
 will cost between Â£1100 and Â£2100.
