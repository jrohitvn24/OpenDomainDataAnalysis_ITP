		<content>{SECOND CRANWELL CUB SCOUTS            
 There are only 10 cubs in our pack,   
 but we still have a good time. Our    
 "hut" is the old school, which is     
 also used to house the play group.    
{THIRD CRANWELL BROWNIES               
 There are 16 of us, and we also use   
 the old school as our meeting place.  
 We enjoy working hard to earn our     
 badges.                               
{PLAY GROUP                            
 Children who are not yet old enough to
 attend Primary School may join the    
 playgroup in the village. They enjoy  
 pre-school activities such as         
 painting, listening to stories, and   
 singing.
