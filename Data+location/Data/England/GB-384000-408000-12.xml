		<title>12Changes in Heywood.3.</title>
		<content>   These {Senior Citizens }also talked 
 about today and how life had changed. 
 Many thought that schools are better, 
 though they thought that too many     
 subjects are studied and that young   
 people today have little respect for  
 their elders. Views differed on       
 whether they would like to be at      
 school today, but none of them would  
 like to be leaving school and looking 
 for a job. Unemployment is a  problem{
 but they could not agree about the    
 value of the {Youth Training Scheme.} 
   They felt that {entertainment }was  
 declining and most of them mentioned  
 dancing and the cinema as their       
 favourites and how these are now      
 lacking. They felt that {Heywood}had  
 not improved for the better and that  
 life today is more difficult for young
 people. They are happy that they have 
 lived their lives when they have.     </content>
