		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN RINGSTEAD</title>
		<content>  The working population is mainly     
 employed by the three farms.There have
 been reductions in the numbers of men 
 needed in recent years as modern      
 methods have been introduced.No new   
 men have been engaged and natural     
 wastage has reduced the work force.The
 situation has now stabilised and it is
 envisaged that the presant level of   
 employment on farms will be maintained
  Small numbers are engaged at nursary 
 in horticulture at a nursary.         
  Local tradesmen such as the          
 blacksmith have disappeared from rural
 life,but overall there is no worsening
 of the unemployment situation as many 
 houses and cottages in the area are   
 now owned by weekenders and holiday   
 migrants and retired people.Incursion 
 of holiday homes can be detrimental   
 but here it appears to make a valuable
 contribution to village and life.     </content>
