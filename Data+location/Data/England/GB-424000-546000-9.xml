     "7:30am - I had breakfast of toast
 sprinkled with cinnamon. After that I 
 went to pack my things for the Destiny
 Run in Durham City. At 8:45am my      
 friend Helen Short and her Mam took me
 to the start. After about an hours    
 chat the run started at last. At first
 it seemed very easy but after a while 
 it got harder but I enjoyed it. I     
 finished in 38 mins 48 secs and I saw 
 Steve Cram signing autographs near the
 finishing line. When I got home I had 
 a bath then showed my Mum the badge,  
 pen, pencil, plaque, cap and poster of
 Sebastian Coe which we had been given 
 for finishing the course.             
      2:30pm - We went to Newcastle    
 upon Tyne to a restaurant called      
 'Happiness Inn' where we had a meal.
