		<content>   {Chalk Farm}and{Spring Hall}take    
 their names from local physical       
 features.                             
   {Four Mile Stable Farm}is situated  
 by the old wooden post which marks a  
 distance of four miles to the finish  
 of Newmarket racecourse. The old      
 course is no longer visible but was a 
 continuation of what is now the Beacon
 Course.                               
   {Hare Park's}name dates back to the 
 late seventeenth century and the reign
 of King Charles 11, when a rectangular
 area covering about 25 acres was      
 enclosed by an earth rampart two feet 
 high and topped with a wooden         
 stockade. This was a warren in which  
 hares were kept in order to provide   
 food during the winter months when    
 fresh meat was scarce.
