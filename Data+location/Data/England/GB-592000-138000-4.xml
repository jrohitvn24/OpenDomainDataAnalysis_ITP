 THAT THE CHURCH WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PAY 
 28d TO THE ARCHBISHOP AT EASTER. THE  
 PRESENT BUILDING BUILT MAINLY OF LOCAL
 RAGSTONE CONTAINS SOME FINE SLABS OF  
 BETHERSDEN MARBLE ONCE QUARRIED IN THE
 AREA. AMONGST THE MEMORIALS ARE TWO   
 BRASSES TO THE LOVELACE FAMILY.       
    THE TOWER CONTAINS A PEAL OF SIX   
 BELLS THE FOURTH OF WHICH IS THOUGHT  
 TO HAVE BEEN CAST IN A LONDON FOUNDRY 
 BETWEEN 1328 AND 1348.
