		<content> I go to the opticians every year to   
 have my eyes tested.The optician who  
 tests your eyes takes you into the    
 medical room and tells you to sit     
 down.He takes your name,your address  
 and your date of birth.The doctor puts
 some lenses over your eyes to see     
 which lenses you need in your glasses.
 After that the optician tells you to  
 read some letters on a piece of card. 
 Then you can go and pick the frames   
 you like best for your glasses.A few  
 weeks later the optician rings you up 
 and tells you to come and collect your
 glasses.                              
                                       
 I suddenly broke my finger while      
 catching a ball.First I went to       
 Seascale surgery where the doctor told
 me I had torn my finger muscle.Then he
 told me I had broken my finger.So I   
 was rushed off to Whitehaven Hospital </content>
