 WEST BERGHOLT 1925                    
   A COMMUNITY WITH THE CHURCH,CHAPEL  
 AND SCHOOL AS THE FOCAL POINTS.       
 NOTABLES WERE THE DOCTOR,DISTRICT     
 NURSE,POLICEMAN AND VARIOUS TRADESMEN.
 THE MAIN EMPLOYERS WERE THE LAND-     
 OWNING GENTRY,FARMERS AND BREWERY.THE 
 WORKERS LIVED WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE 
 OF WORK,IN A TIED OR RENTED COTTAGE.  
  CHILDREN RAISED UNDER THESE          
 CIRCUMSTANCEES WERE HAPPY AND SECURE  
 BECAUSE THEY KNEW OF NOTHING BEYOND TO
 UNSETTLE THEM.MANUAL WORKERS HAD NO   
 ANNUAL HOLIDAY SO THEY SELDOM HAD THE 
 TIME,OPPORTUNITY OR MONEY TO ESCAPE   
 THIS ENVIRONMENT.                     
   1939 WORLD WAR 2 BROUGHT CHANGES TO 
 VILLAGE LIFE THAT WERE IRREVOCABLE.   
 MANY THAT LEFT DID NOT WANT TO RETURN 
 TO PREVIOUS SITUATIONS.
