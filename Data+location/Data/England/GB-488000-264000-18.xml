		<title>18The River Nene</title>
		<content>                                       
The River Nene flows in a valley       
between Northampton and Wellingborough 
It is a navigable river with guillotine
locks controlling the water flow. The  
last commercial barges used the river  
in 1969 when they brought bulk grain   
to Whitworths Mill. The river is being 
developed as a leisure resource for    
holiday boating, fishing and walking.  
On any week end during the fishing     
season the banks are lined with men    
dressed in old clothes and cowering    
beneath large green umbrellas. Last    
year the river was badly polluted when 
a brewery in Northampton released      
effluent into the river killing nearly 
all the fish. Access to the river in   
this area is limited placing a         
considerable strain on those living on 
the access roads.
