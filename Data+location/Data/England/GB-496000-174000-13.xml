		<title>13ZYLLAH COOKE AT OLD WINDSOR</title>
		<content> On 28th June 1985 we met Zyllah Cooke 
 at Old Windsor Lock;she had been at   
 Sunbury at 6.30 a.m. because her Save 
 Our Swan organisation had had a report
 of a swan on the Thames with a fishing
 line and eight pieces of lead weight  
 hanging from its beak.Now she and     
 volunteer assistant Tim Heron were    
 looking for a family of swans with a  
 sick cygnet;the lock-keeper told them 
 he had heard of them at Runnymede that
 morning.  Zyllah carried a swan net   
 and pole each with expandable handles 
 used to capture the injured swans.    
 As we were leaving we learned that    
 they were trying to borrow a boat to  
 row down-river to Runnymede to search 
 for the family of swans.
