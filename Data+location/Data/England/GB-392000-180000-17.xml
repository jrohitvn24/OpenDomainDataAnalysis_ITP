		<content> My pony goes out into the field about 
 10.30am.My Mum puts him out because   
 I'm at school.When I get home from    
 school I change into my riding        
 clothes.Then go out and catch him and 
 bring him in for grooming.For         
 grooming I use a body brush and a hoof
 pick.After I've finised grooming him  
 I get him ready for riding by getting 
 my saddle and bridle.And  I get my    
 skull cap as well. A skull cap is     
 different than a riding hat and safer.
 Now I'm ready for a ride.I normally go
 with my Mum or Dad because my Mum does
 not think its safe on my own.When we  
 get back I untack and give him a dish 
 of horse and pony nuts.I can't give   
 him oats because it makes him frisky. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
