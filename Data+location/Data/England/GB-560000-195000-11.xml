		<title>11The County Fire Headquarters</title>
		<content>   When there is an emergency anywhere 
 in the whole of Essex it is received  
 at the Central Computerised  Control  
 Room at Fire Brigade Headquarters in  
 Hutton.The Headquarters were opened   
 in 1977 by the Duchess of Kent.The old
 Headquarters which at one time was a  
 children's home have been turned into 
 flats.                                
   Almost 15,000 emergency calls are   
 dealt with each year,one tenth are    
 malicious ones.The calls range from   
 chimney fires which only need one fire
 engine to major incidents where twenty
 or more appliances are needed.        
   The computer has all the addresses  
 of special premises,streets and place 
 names in the county.                  
   We were told that firemen aren't    
 called firemen any more because women 
 are now doing the job as well.Everyone
 is now called a firefighter.          </content>
