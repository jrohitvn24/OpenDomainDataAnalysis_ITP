		<title>07HILL FARM, THURGARTON</title>
		<content>   The{Boots' Company}farm the{1000 }  
 acres which comprise virtually the    
 whole of this block which is out of   
 the Trent Valley i.e.the N.W. corner. 
 Three farms have been amalgamated and 
 are now operated from{Hill Farm. }    
   Business methods dominate with      
 efficiency at a premium.The whole     
 enterprise is run by a manager,two    
 cowmen,two tractor drivers,a young    
 woman relief to both, and part-time   
 help from the retired ex-manager.     
   The land,being of sticky clay,is    
 much heavier than in the valley.{Half}
 this land is given over to{wheat,}the 
 grain being sold as a cash crop for   
{ bread}making.The other{500 acres}is  
 used for{grazing or grass growing}for 
 the cows.Up to 4000 tons of{silage}are
 made every year by taking the         
 hay,pickling it in acid and keeping it
 under plastic sheets for winter feed. </content>
