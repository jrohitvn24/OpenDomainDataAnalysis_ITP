		<content> HOUSING.  TANG HALL AREA.             
    My house is owned by York City     
 Council.  It is the end house of a    
 terrace and is about 40 years old.    
 Inside there is a small kitchen with a
 pantry, a dining room, and lounge and 
 hall downstairs and upstairs there is 
 a landing, two large bedrooms, one    
 small bedroom and a bathroom with a   
 toilet in it.   Outside we have a     
 toilet and a tool shed.  There is a   
 back garden and a front garden.  Both 
 are covered with grass.  Beside me my 
 brother, sister, mum and dad live in  
 the house.  The house is very small,  
 especially when we are all in it.     
 There are many houses like mine in the
 area.
