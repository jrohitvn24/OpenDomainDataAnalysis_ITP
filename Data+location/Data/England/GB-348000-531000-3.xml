		<content> There are 14 council caravans.The     
 travellers are people who have a      
 caravan at the site to live in but go 
 abroad to sell their wares in the     
 summer.Their caravans are very smart  
 with lots of silver and crystal in    
 them.There are mirrors engraved with  
 flowers and silver panels on the      
 wall.The seats are covered with velvet
 and the carpet deep and plush.There   
 are no beds but they pull out the     
 sofas to sleep on.They wash their     
 hands and wipe their shoes every time 
 they go in and look and sound well-   
 mannered and tidy.But with not going  
 to school,as soon as they are outside 
 their caravans the fighting and the   
 indescribable language begins.It      
 can be nice living there but at times 
 it is like living in a goldfish       
 bowl.                                 
                                       </content>
