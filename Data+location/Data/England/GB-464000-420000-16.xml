		<title>16SNAITH CLOG MILL</title>
		<content> About a hundred years ago when Snaith 
 wasn't as big as it is now there used 
 to be a clog mill. It made the soles  
 of clogs. There was only one other    
 such mill in this part of the country.
 The main material used was Beech wood.
 Each week some 2000 pairs of clogs    
 were made and sold wordwide.          
 The original building has now been    
 converted into housing.
