		<title>11WORSHIP AT CROPWELL BUTLER</title>
		<content>{The Methodist Church}was built in 1822
 &amp; extended in 1903. It will now       
 hold a hundred people. The Anglican   
 Chapel-of-Ease in the village closed  
 and its font and 2 carved chairs and  
 Church ornaments were removed to our  
 Church, so that Anglican members felt 
 at home there. We have an enthusiastic
 Organist, so enjoy some good singing. 
 Members help with the cleaning and    
 flower arrangements for the Communion 
 Table. We have two members who are    
 interested in workwork &amp; building, so 
 a keen eye is kept on the upkeep of   
 the Chapel. Each month we have a      
 Fellowship Meeting instead of a       
 service, arranged by members who pick 
 their own favourite hymns. It is      
 followed by tea &amp; biscuits. This is a 
 change and it is working well.
