		<content> Everyone in our class has at least one
 pet.The most popular pets are cats and
 just over a third of us have both a   
 cat and a dog. The dogs are of many   
 different breeds. Most common are     
 labradors and mongrels and crossbred. 
 The next most popular pets are in     
 order, rabbits, fish and birds. Two   
 children have horses, others would    
 like to have one as well but the main 
 problem is that animals cost to much  
 to keep. When it comes to looking     
 after pets, our mothers seem to do    
 most of the work but about half of us 
 take at least some share.             
   My family has three horses , we like
 riding and having horses. We have also
 got an Alsation dog called Jody, and  
 two cats that I feed. When I get a    
 chance to take our dog for a walk I   
 take her a long walk.
