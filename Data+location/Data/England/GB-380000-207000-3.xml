		<title>03A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 Mr Stevens, the farmer at Standish    
 Court Farm, has to get up each day at 
 5 o'clock. He has three and a half    
 helpers on the farm. First he has to  
 get the Friesian cows milked and then 
 he moves the fences so that the cattle
 can get fresh grass for the day. Then 
 he has breakfast.                     
  After breakfast, Mr Stevens and his  
 son, Graham, make the round silage    
 bales and feed all the other animals. 
 He has an hour for dinner, then they  
 put plastic bags on the hay bales to  
 protect them from the rain. About 1000
 hay bales are needed on this farm for 
 the cows to eat in winter. In the     
 evening, the cows are milked again. He
 stops work at about 8.15 pm. His busy 
 day is over.
