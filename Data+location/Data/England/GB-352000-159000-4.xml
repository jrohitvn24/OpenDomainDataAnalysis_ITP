		<content> The name Chew Stoke is derived from   
 the River Chew &amp; the Saxon stockade or
 cattlehold. This area was given by    
 "The Conqueror" to{Gilbert Fitzturold}
 and is enters in the Domesday Book as 
{Chiwe stock.}This Fitzturold plotted  
 against the King so his lands were    
 seized and later came to the{St. Loe} 
 family whose coats of arms are on the 
 walls of the Rectory - probably the   
 old manor. The High Street, reputed to
 be the smallest in England consists of
 2 rows of modernised cottages now     
 occupied on one side by Council       
 tenants it extends from the old pack  
 horse bridge over the river Chew      
 towards the Church. Housing in the    
 area varies from primitive cottages to
 large detached houses in select       
 developments such as Quarry Hay. The  
 asking price for modernised old houses
 of character with land is Â£135,000.   </content>
