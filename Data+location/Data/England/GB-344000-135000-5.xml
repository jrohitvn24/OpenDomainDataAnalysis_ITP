		<content>   The school was built in 1836.  It   
 developed as a{church school}from that
 date and was known in the village as  
 the National School.  Constructed of  
 lias stone with a slate roof, the     
 building has been much modified and   
 modernised over the years.  The       
 school house now used as part of the  
 school building, with additional      
 classroom space in a temporary        
 building of rather permanent nature.  
   In common with other eleven year old
 children in this area, education      
 beyond the primary stage is provided  
 at Crispin School in nearby Street.
