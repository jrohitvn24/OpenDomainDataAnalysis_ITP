		<title>18Entertainments in Bramdean</title>
		<content> The most accessible entertainment in  
 Bramdean is the appreciation of the   
 countryside itself.  Within yards of  
 every home there is a country walk    
 with access to flora and fauna, and   
 scenery of outstanding beauty. Most   
 homes own a T.V. and other home       
 entertainments such as radio and music
 centres; pianos and computers are more
 limited.  Another innovation is the   
 video recorder. Hobbies such as       
 gardening, knitting, sewing, painting,
 photography and etc., are naturally   
 important in area where more organised
 entertainments are limited.  There is 
 a public house in the village.  There 
 is a Women's Institute, Over 60's     
 club, bingo club and youth club.  The 
 village hall hosts discos and         
 barbecues.  The nearest cinema,       
 theatre and swimming pool is 9 miles.
