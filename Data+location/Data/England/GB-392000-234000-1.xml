		<content> Our area is rural,and 90% of it is    
 covered with farmland.The{Birmingham  
{to Bristol railway}runs through{Bredon
 village north to south ,and crosses   
 the{Carrant Brook}to the south of     
 Kinsham}.A lot of the streams drain   
 into the Brook  which crosses East to 
 West  before flowing into the River   
 Avon .The villages which are in our   
 area are:most of Bredon,Kinsham{,Aston
{on Carrant},part of{Kemerton}and part 
 of{Northway.}.Around 50% of the houses
 have been built in the last 10 years, 
 so are quite new.The countryside      
 slopes gently from north to south.A   
 lot of minor roads connect the        
 villages,but no major ones.Our area is
 mainly in the county of{Hereford and  
{Worcester, but to the}south of the    
 Carrant Brook it is Gloucestershire.
