 My mum normally wakes me up at        
 8.00am.I have a shower and then I get 
 dressed.I go down stairs and feed my  
 dog and take him out for a walk.When I
 get back indoors it is normally 8.55am
 and then my mum takes me and my friend
 to school.She drops us at the car park
 and we walk to school from there.     
                                       
 Usually we arrive at school around    
 9.10am.The whistle goes at 9.15am.    
 While the register is being read we   
 read quietly and at 9.30am we go into 
 the rector's assembly until 9.45am.We 
 have a whole lesson with him until    
 playtime which is at 10.45am until    
 11.00am.Our next lesson is maths.We   
 have this lesson until dinner time    
 which is at 12.15pm.
