		<title>18  The Sunshine Club.</title>
		<content>     The Club was started by the       
 W.R.V.S. in 1972 and there were 50    
 members. There are now 25 men and     
 women members over 60. The idea is to 
 get these  people out of their homes  
 for an enjoyable afternoon and to give
 them  friendship and an interest in   
 outside activities. They meet twice a 
 month on Fridays from 2 pm to 4 pm.   
     Each member pays a small          
 subscription at the beginning of each 
 year and other money is collected from
 coffee mornings and jumble sales.     
 People are very kind and invite the   
 Club to tea parties and garden        
 parties.                              
      Mrs.Curry is the club leader and 
 she is helped by other people who     
 arrange the meetings. They have a very
 special party at Christmas.
