		<title>17LIVING IN SEDBERGH</title>
		<content>      Many people in this area do not  
 want their communities and the        
 landscape to change, they like things 
 the way they are.  For some, basic    
 services such as water supplies,      
 drainage and sanitation are very      
 primitive but properties are expensive
 to purchase; Â£25,000 for a small      
 terraced cottage in Sedbergh.  Prices 
 are inflated largely by the holiday   
 homes market.                         
      Both locals and "off-comers" (new
 inhabitants) share a love of the wild 
 countryside and the sense of peace and
 quiet.                                
      People are concerned about the   
 problems of the world, such as the    
 nuclear threat, but they feel a sense 
 of being apart from the international 
 crises they hear about on television  
 and radio.  This is why they like     
 living here.                          </content>
