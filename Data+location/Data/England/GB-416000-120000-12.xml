		<content> is now used. 50 men work at the       
 Tannery; different skills are needed  
 for different jobs. Protective        
 clothing, such as gloves, Wellingtons 
 and leggings, is needed when working  
 with lime. The leather goes through   
 these stages: washing, soaking in lime
 pits, removal of hair and flesh,      
 cutting, tanning, drying and          
 bleaching. Finished leather is rolled,
 polished and classified. Leather from 
 the Tannery is used to make saddles,  
 bridles, weight-lifting belts, soles  
 and heels for shoes. Leather for the  
 Household Cavalry has been tanned at  
 Downton. The leather is exported      
 mainly to the Far East, America, Italy
 and Ireland. The work is not dangerous
 if yoy are careful, Mr. Birch told    
 us. He would not make any changes to  
 the tanning process but sees a time   
 when machines will replace more men.  </content>
