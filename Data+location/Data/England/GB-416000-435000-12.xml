		<content>   I live at 1048 Bolton Road.I go to  
 Bolton Lane First School.At home I    
 make up games and play them with my   
 brother.I also play with my Sindy     
 dolls.I play the recorder and I am    
 learning the piano.I go to the park   
 quite a lot and usually take my roller
 boots.                                
   I like my house because it is near  
 to school and I live next door to     
 Robert and Nicola.I don't like my     
 house because it is near a main road  
 and I can't get to my friend's house  
 without being taken across the road.  
   My school is very nice and we do    
 lots of nice things.My favourite is PE
 or gymnastics.I also like Nelson      
 Grammar and Peak Maths but I don't    
 like 8-a-Day.We go on some nice       
 trips.I will soon be leaving to go to 
 Wellington Middle School.
