     Some of the farms are rented from 
 the N.C.B. and these include Fox Lane 
 Farm, Plane Tree Farm and Dovecote    
 Farm. These have total acreages around
 200. The Crown Farm is owned and      
 farmed by the Durdy family. The Manor 
 Farm, Harlington is owned and farmed  
 by Mr Wade. The Manor Farm, Barnburgh 
 and its land belonged to Lord Halifax 
 but the farmstead was sold to Mr      
 Burke,and the land, some 120 acres of 
 parkland (Hickleton Park), is now     
 sublet for grazing beef cattle. Since 
 1980 Centre Farm has ceased to        
 function as a farm. The land was      
 auctioned, and the farmhouse and stone
 out-buildings are at present being    
 converted into five luxury homes.
