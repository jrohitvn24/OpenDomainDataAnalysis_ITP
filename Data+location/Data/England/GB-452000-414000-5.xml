		<title>05NORTON STRAWBERRY GROWERS.</title>
		<content> popular variety is the CAMBRIDGE      
 FAVOURITE because of its              
 abundant cropping,keeping quality and 
 taste. Another main crop is           
 raspberries selling at 36p per lb     
 and,an experiment is being made to    
 guage customer reaction by growing    
 gooseberries,loganberries and         
 blackberries for self-picking.        
   The attraction to the customer of   
 being able to self-pick is            
 cheapness,self-ascertained quality and
 freshness. Much of thw fruit is picked
 for immediate consumption but much of 
 thr fruit is also either frozen, or   
 made into puree or jam.               
     There are three permanent         
 employees but during the season more  
 staff are employed to act as cashiers 
 and for security reasons.             
 Unfortunately the theft of fruit      
 increases year by year.               </content>
