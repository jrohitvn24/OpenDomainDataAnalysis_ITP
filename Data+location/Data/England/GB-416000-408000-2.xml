		<content> Field Head Farm                       
 Mr. &amp; Mrs. Matthews have farmed at    
 Field Head Farm on the edge of Shepley
 village for twelve years. The farm    
 covers one hundred and eight acres and
 except for a few fields of barley     
 grain for winter feed, the land is    
 cultivated for grazing. We found most 
 of the land around here was used for  
 pasture land.  We visited them in June
 when they had finished their first    
 cutting of grass for winter sileage.  
 They hope to cut three times a year.  
 There were one hundred and twenty     
 three cows on the farm, mainly dairy  
 breeds but a few beef. Many farmers   
 around Shepley bottle and sell their  
 own milk but Mr. Matthews sells his to
 the Milk Marketing Board. It is then  
 taken to a big local creamery where it
 is made into yogurt and cottage       
 cheese.                               </content>
