		<title>12HEALTH AROUND TYWARDREATH</title>
		<content> If you were ill you would probably    
 have to book an appointment at{Par    
{Health Centre}(just down the road from
 Tywardreath). There they have a{group 
{practice}of three doctors. There is a 
 surgery in the morning and evening on 
 five days of the week. Besides seeing 
 people who are ill they also do{      
{preventative medicine,}like taking the
 blood pressure of men over 35 and     
 immunizing children. If you cannot get
 to the surgery a doctor will see you  
 at home. The three doctors also work  
 at the{cottage hospital at Fowey}which
 is about 5 miles away. The doctors can
 perform small operations there and    
 older people can go there if they need
 care after having an operation. It is 
 a very small hospital, only 16 beds,  
 but it is very good and we are glad it
 is there.
