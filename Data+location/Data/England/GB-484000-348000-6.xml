       There used to be a stone arch   
 near the duck pond over the road. It  
 was taken to Stubton Hall School.     
       Mrs Bagworth, whose house was a 
 bakery, told us that the bread was    
 taken to Baggaley's house. She could  
 also remember every one had a cow that
 was kept in a field by Gypsy Wood.    
       Mrs Henson told us about the    
 church. The church was built mostly in
 the 13th to the 14th century. It      
 hasn't any stained glass windows which
 is strange for that time. The Lucas   
 family are all buried in the          
 churchyard. Some pews are called      
 Poppyheads. John Daubney fell through 
 the floor right from the top of the   
 spire. He was not injured and you can 
 see his nail marks down the wall. The 
 bells have not been used for at least 
 ten years.                            </content>
