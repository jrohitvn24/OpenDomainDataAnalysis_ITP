		<title>03BRIGG STATION (CONTINUED)</title>
		<content> on the above prices.  Due to lack of  
 use the double track has been torn up 
 outside Brigg level crossing and now  
 has become a single line.  We are of  
 the opinion that this Eastern {artery}
 to the coast may well be closed in the
 near future.  The booking office is   
 now a private residence and there is a
 general air of deprivation around the 
 2l6O square metre{area.}We did notice 
 that a mail-van met the lO.36 am from 
 Sheffield but this was the only       
 activity on the station.  Of the      
 trains we surveyed no{passenger}got   
 off or on then and we feel that the   
 townsfolk do not really appreciate    
 their station and probably will not   
 miss the amenity until it is gone.    
 Obviously the new{fare}increase will  
 depress this type of travel even      
 further.
