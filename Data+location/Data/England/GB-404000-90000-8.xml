		<content> So there are other benefits for local 
 people.                               
 3. The development of the Old Gasworks
 site in Old Poole will lead to more   
 houses as well as trade and industry  
 in that area. It may also lead to     
 major changes in the road system      
 serving that part of the town. The    
 people at the Civic Centre will be    
 able to show you a map of what is     
 proposed.                             
 4. Poole is an old town with a history
 going back many hundreds of years. The
 port of Poole and its harbour have    
 always been important assets for both 
 trade and leisure purposes. We are    
 lucky to live in such a lovely area   
 and, as Poole grows and changes, we   
 must ensure that we also preserve what
 is good of the past and so hand on to 
 future generations a town of which    
 they too can be proud.  (sgd)John Ward</content>
