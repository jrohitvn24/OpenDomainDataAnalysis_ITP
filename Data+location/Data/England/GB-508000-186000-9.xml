		<title>09RUISLIP'S TRAFFIC PROBLEMS</title>
		<content>    The traffic problems in Ruislip are
 accute. On a survey done at the bottom
 of the High Street (the main shopping 
 centre) going up Bury Street (B455) or
 Sharps Lane (a suburban road that was 
 a short cut but has since been given  
 restricted access), for five minutes  
 on a wet Monday morning. 300 vehicles 
 passed. 216 cars (72%), 75 vans (25%),
 5 lorries (2%),1 bus (&lt;1%), 1 taxi    
 (&lt;1%), and 2 hearses on the way to    
 Breakspear Crematorium (within the    
 Domesday block). A one way system was 
 planned for the High Street but       
 residents objected to the use of a    
 suburban road for returning traffic.  
    The car park in Ruislip is next to 
 the leisure complex. The council      
 charged a fee of 20p an hour after a  
 period free of charge. The public     
 didn't use the facility and now the   
 price is 10p a day it is well used.   </content>
