 The{Barclays Bank}employs 12 people.  
 Mr Partridge is the bank manager who  
 started working there in 1974.There   
 has been a branch in the Deepings     
 since 1900.The bank provides over     
 200 services concerned with financial 
 aid and advice.                       
  They use plastic money(creditcards)  
 such as Barclaycards.They also have   
 young savers accounts in which you can
 put your pocket money and take it out 
 when it's required. They are a service
 industry without which commerce and   
 industry could not function at a very 
 competitive price.                    
  The coins are counted by scales but  
 the notes are counted by hand.In the  
 future they are hoping to have a cash 
 dispenser.
