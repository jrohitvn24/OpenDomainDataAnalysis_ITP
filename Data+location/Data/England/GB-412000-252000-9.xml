 In this area there are a number of old
 cottages. Some are built of stone with
 slate roofs and others of wattle and  
 daub, with thached roofs.This area is 
 well known for thached roofs.Many of  
 the older cottages were demolished and
 rebuilt by the Lord of the Manor in   
 1855. Each village has had modern     
 houses built which generally blend in 
 with the older houses.In Temple       
 Grafton there are two rows of council 
 houses.One row is cement_rendered and 
 the other row is red brick.There are  
 also several terraced houses in Temple
 Grafton.You had to go up the garden to
 the toilet because they used not to   
 have indoor toilets. Welford has much 
 more modern property and many of the  
 older houses have been enlarged. The  
 council houses are semi-detached but  
 most of the houses here are detached. </content>
