		<content>  The town expanded with the coming of 
the railway in 1845.The gasworks were  
built in 1860 and the Corn Hall in     
1863.The large houses on Station Road  
and Connaught Road were built about    
this time by wealthier and professional
citizens.The coaching trade suffered as
a result of the railways development.  
  The railway still operates(pay       
trains) but has gone into decline.The  
car is now the main form of transport  
in the area.Most residents work outside
the area but there has been a          
considerable building programme and    
population increase over the past 20   
years.                                 
  Through traffic has been one of the  
main drawbacks in recent years but the 
opening of the bypass (Jun '85) should 
herald the start of a more peaceful    
and enjoyable existence for those      
living and shopping in the town.       </content>
