		<title>11ARMED FORCES-NAVY SEA KINGS</title>
		<content> There are four front line squadrons at
 Culdrose which train to do many       
 different kinds of job.They use Mark 2
 and Mark 5 Sea Kings.The Mark 2's     
 have round radar domes on the back and
 Mark 3's have square domes.Some Sea   
 Kings carry radar domes underneath    
 them while flying.These are called AEW
 or Airborne Early Warning helicopters.
   Sea Kings are equipped to hunt      
 submarines and attack with torpedoes  
 and depth charges.Sea Kings have      
 clever instruments to help them fly at
 night and in bad weather.820,824 and  
 826 squadrons wre very important in   
 the Falklands War.                    
   Apart from anti-submarine work the  
 Sea Kings are used for ferrying       
 supplies to ships and for Search and  
 Rescue.Once they have finished        
 training at Culdrose the sqadrons go  
 aboard Navy ships all over the world. </content>
