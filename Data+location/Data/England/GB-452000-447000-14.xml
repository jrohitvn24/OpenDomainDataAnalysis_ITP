		<title>14The Brownies</title>
		<content> I joined the Brownies when I was      
 seven. The meetings are held at the   
 village hall on a Tuesday.The Brownies
 are a group of children under         
 eleven.Lady and Lord Baden_Powell     
 started the Brownies .The uniform we  
 wear is brown and we wear a yellow    
 neckerchief. We leave at ten years    
 old or we can stay on till we are     
 eleven. The leader of the pack is     
 called Brown_Owl and her helpers are  
 Snowny_Owl and Tawny Owl. When we join
 we make a promise and we have to keep 
 it till we leave.We earn badges for   
 doing things like cooking and         
 swimming.This is the promise we make: 
 I promise that I will do my best. To  
 do my duty to God. To serve the queen 
 and to help other people and to       
 keep the Brownie Guide law.
