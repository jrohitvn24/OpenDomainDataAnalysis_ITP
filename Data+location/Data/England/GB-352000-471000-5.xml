		<title>05SHUTTLEWORTHS FARM</title>
		<content> The crops they grow here are mostly   
 grass but there are also some potatoes
 . There is two hundred acres of       
 grassland and four acres of potatoes. 
 Potatoes are grown for two to three   
 years then grain crops with grass are 
 grown. They keep 150 cattle. Fifty of 
 these are milk cows.100 animals are   
 calves from a few days old to two     
 years old. Some of these are male     
 which are used for beef. Most of the  
 cows are Fresians and a few are       
 Guernseys. They also keep 100 breeding
 ewes. All the lambs are sold for meat.
 Forty years ago the farm was about 130
 acres but small farms in the district 
 have been added. The farmhouse was not
 originally part of the holding.A much 
 smaller house now used as the farm    
 dairy and feed store was then the farm
 house. The old buildings were stone   
 with slate rooves.                    </content>
