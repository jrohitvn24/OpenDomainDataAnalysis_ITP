		<title>20B2116 Traffic Count</title>
		<content>  I went in a car to the B2116 road    
 with Mrs Taylor and Sally Courcha on  
 Wednesday 3rd of July.This is a small 
 country road off the main Lewes to    
 Chaily road.It runs along the bottom  
 of the steep slope that leads up to   
 the top of the Downs.We went to count 
 the traffic using the road from       
 10:00am for an hour,until 11:00am.    
  During that hour there were 92 cars, 
 3 bikes,0 buses,1 motorbikes, 5       
 lorries,11 vans and 1 tractor going   
 towards Lewes.There were also 78      
 cars,10 lorries, 4 motor bikes,16     
 vans, 3 bikes,0 buses and 1 tractor   
 coming from Lewes.                    
  We thought it was a quiet country    
 road,but we discovered that it was    
 quite busy.Altogether 225 vehicles    
 travelled along the road during the   
 hour we were taking our count.
