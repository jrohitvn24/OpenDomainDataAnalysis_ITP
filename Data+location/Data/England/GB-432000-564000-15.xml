		<title>15INDUSTRY - TYNE SHIPYARDS</title>
		<content> In 1984{Middle Docks and Wallsend     
{Drydocks}were purchased by{Tyne       
{Shiprepair}from{British               
{Shipbuilders.}Ships have been repaired
 at Middle Docks since 1870.They have  
 four drydocks suitable for any vessel 
 from small offshore supply boats to   
 vessels up to 50,000 d.w.t.In Middle  
 Docks we saw the drydocks where the   
 ships rest on keel blocks and the     
 sides are supported by bilge blocks.  
 The Royal Navy Frigate{H.M.S. Euryalus
 was in for refit.We also saw The      
{Seaforth Crusader,}an oil rig supply  
 vessel, built in Singapore.There were 
 three tug boats,{The Seasider,        
{The Ironsider}and{The}Tynesider.500   
 men work at the Middle Dock and if    
 there is an important job to be       
 completed then up to 1,000 men can be 
 employed.
