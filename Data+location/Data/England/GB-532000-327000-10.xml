		<title>10 Landscape of Holbeach Marsh</title>
		<content> The landscape around here is very     
 flat. It's flat because until the     
 Middle Ages there were only little    
 islands with water all around them,and
 it used to run over all or most of the
 land. In doing so it would wash       
 away any silt or rocks that may have  
 formed any hills. The water came in   
 rivers that spread out over wide areas
 and the sea that came in from the     
 Wash. That is why it is not hilly.    
 There is more sky than land around    
 here. There are few trees around but  
 not many. There are lots of potatoes  
 and vegetable fields. The fields are  
 divided by dykes instead of hedges and
 you can see for a long way. There are 
 also some crops like, wheat, barley   
 and sugar beet. There are lots of     
 smaller fields down the sluice road   
 where there are small holdings.
