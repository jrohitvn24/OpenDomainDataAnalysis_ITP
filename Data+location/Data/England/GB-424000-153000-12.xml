 The Forestry Commission looks after   
 the forest, which has an area of 1200 
 acres. A wildlife ranger looks after  
 the wildlife which include a large    
 number of deer.                       
 The trees are mainly beech, with      
 spruce larch and other coniferous     
 trees. It is a mixed  wood, and there 
 are also some ornamental trees such as
 cherry.Some of the trees are          
 between 150 and 200 years old         
 although most of them have been       
 planted in the last 50 years.         
 The woods are used regu;arly by the   
 people of the village. A County       
 council byway cuts through the woods  
 and so cars can be taken into the     
 woods.
