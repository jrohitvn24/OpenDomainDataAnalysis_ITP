		<title>03 CUSTOMS IN GRAVESEND</title>
		<content>IN GRAVESEND WE HAVE MANY CUSTOMS AND  
TRADITIONS.ON THE RIVER THAMES A FERRY 
HAS RUN FOR YEARS,LINKING GRAVESEND    
WITH TILBURY IN ESSEX.MANY PEOPLE USED 
THE FERRY TO GO TO ESSEX IN THE PAST,  
BUT NOW IT IS USED LITTLE AND COSTS A  
GREAT DEAL FOR A JOURNEY.              
MANY OF THE WHARFS AND PIERS ARE STILL 
IN USE,BUT THE RIVER IS NOT USED AS    
MUCH AS IT WAS.GRAVESEND STILL HAS TUGS
TO SEE THE LARGE SHIPS IN AND OUT OF   
THE ESTUARY.ON NEW YEARS EVE IT IS A   
CUSTOM FOR TUGS AND SHIPS TO SOUND THE 
NEW YEAR IN.                           
TWO REGATTAS ARE HELD IN GRAVESEND IN  
SUMMER,A BIG TOWN REGATTA,AND A        
SHRIMPERS REGATTA.LOCAL ORGANISATIONS  
AND RIVER MEN HOLD RACES ON THE THAMES.
FOOTBALL TEAMS,CLUBS,FACTORIES AND     
YOUTH CLUBS COMPETE FOR TROPHIES IN    
ROWING AND SAILING.
