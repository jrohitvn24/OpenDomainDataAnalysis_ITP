		<title>08DAIRYING NEAR ODDINGLEY</title>
		<content> One of the farms we visited was a     
 typical dairy farm of the area.It is  
 called{Cummins farm.}The majority of  
 the land use is pasture for grazing.  
 When we arrived we saw the Milk       
 Marketing Board tanker leaving with   
 the day's milk.As well as grazing the 
 cows feed on Thypon, which helps to   
 produce more milk.They milk the cows  
 from ten in the morning, and then     
 again at three in the afternoon.      
 The storage tanks were kept in a      
 shelter next to the place where the   
 cows were milked.                     
   The farm is a family farm with      
 father doing the majority of the work 
 with help from his wife,son and       
 daughter. The son is carrying on the  
 farming tradition and is at present at
 agricultural college.
