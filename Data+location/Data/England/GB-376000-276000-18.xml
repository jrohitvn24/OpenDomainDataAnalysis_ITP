		<title>18Trimpley Reservoir- Utility</title>
		<content>      Part of the Severn Trent Water   
 Authority,the reservoir covers 29acres
 with a top collecting pool 40ft deep &amp;
 a bottom mud lagoon. Built in 1966, it
 adds 30 million galls/day to the Elan 
 Valley Aqueduct for Birmingham.Locally
 it supplies parts of Mamble and       
 Tenbury.Water is pumped from the River
 Severn, spread over the collecting    
 pool, and piped to the waterworks to  
 be chemically treated and filtered    
 before passing into the pipeline from 
 Wales.The thick mud waste is collected
 in the mud lagoon and left to settle, 
 clean water returning to the river.   
      The reservoir had to be built    
 around a Yew tree protected by a      
 preservation order, interrupting the  
 otherwise perfect oval. Imported from 
 India many years ago, the tree is said
 to be the only one of its kind in the 
 country.                              </content>
