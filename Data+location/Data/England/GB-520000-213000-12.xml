		<title>12ROMAN BATH-HOUSE</title>
		<content> Welwyn, Hertfordshire, is a very old  
 town.  There is much evidence of Roman
 occupation, particularly within the   
 former area of Lockleys Park known as 
 Dicket Mead which adjoins the River   
 Mimram, but which has now been altered
 to allow for road improvements.  One  
 of the most remarkable discoveries was
 made by local archaeologist, Mr Tony  
 Rook of Welwyn, under whose direction 
 a complete Roman Bathhouse has been   
 excavated and preserved.  It actually 
 lies beneath the A1 motorway in a     
 especially designed building which is 
 now administered by the Welwyn        
 Hatfield Museum Service and is        
 normally open to the public on Sundays
 between 2 - 5 pm.  It is thought to   
 have formed part of a Roman villa or  
 complex of buildings.
