 My house was built in 1880. It is a   
 Victorian house. It has 5 bedrooms,a  
 bathroom.2 cloakrooms,3 reception     
 rooms, a double garage, a kitchen, a  
 boxroom, a linen room and a utility   
 room. The garden is 3/4 of an acre.In 
 the garden we have a pond, a          
 greenhouse, a barn and a potting shed.
 We also have a wood store and a apple 
 store. In evey bedroom there is a cast
 iron fireplace with decorations on it.
 We have had the kitchen modernised but
 we still have the servants bells      
 hanging on the wall. We still have an 
 old-fashioned pantry with marble      
 shelves. The north wing of the house  
 had an extension built in 1937.       
 Altogether the house has got fifteen  
 rooms, not including the garage. The  
 house is coloured pink and white.
