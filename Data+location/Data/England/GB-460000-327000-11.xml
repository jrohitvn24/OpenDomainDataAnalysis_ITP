		<title>11The Rector</title>
		<content> The Rev. Guy Bookless became Vicar of 
 Willoughby and Wysall and priest in   
 charge of Widmerpool in 1978. The     
 first two have formed a joint living  
 for 150 years. This year Widmerpool   
 (which has a rector) officially be-   
 came linked to the other two; because 
 the title Rector takes precedence over
 that of Vicar, the parish priest has  
 just become a Rector! He is forgoing  
 an installation because he retires on 
 5th November; he will live in Lough-  
 borough. He spent time in Harlow, St. 
 Albans and India during his ministry. 
 His wife is a deaconess and helps run 
 the Sunday Schools, runs the Mothers  
 Union and undertakes the lay training 
 for women as well as assisting with   
 other church activities. The vicarage 
 is in Wysall and is fairly modern, the
 old vicarage having been sold as it is
 too large and inconvenient.           </content>
