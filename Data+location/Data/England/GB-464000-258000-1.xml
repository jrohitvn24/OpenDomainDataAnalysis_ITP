		<title>01THE HEYFORDS, NORTHANTS</title>
		<content>Nether Heyford (sometimes called Lower 
Heyford) is in Northamptonshire; its   
co-ordinates are 52'13N and 1'01W.     
Nether Heyford is recorded in the      
Domesday Book as {HEIFORD(E)} or       
{HAIFORD(E)}. There are about 1700     
people living in the village. It has   
one of the largest {registered Village 
Greens} in the country; it is just     
under 5 acres. On the north side of    
the Green there is a road that runs    
right through the village, from        
Bugbrooke to Weedon. Middle Street     
leads off this road, going north to    
Upper Heyford, 1 mile away. Upper      
Heyford is recorded in the Domesday    
Book as {THE OTHER HAIFORD}. There are 
about 160 people living in Upper       
Heyford.                               
                                       
N.B. There is also a Lower and an Upper
Heyford in {Oxfordshire).              </content>
