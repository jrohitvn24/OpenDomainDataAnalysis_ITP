		<title>14ROUNDERS AT BEAFORD</title>
		<content>   My favourite game is Rounders. The  
 object of the game is for one team to 
 score more rounders than the other    
 team. We use a tennis ball, wooden    
 bats, four posts and two mats. First  
 one team fields while the other team  
 bats. The bowler stands on a mat a few
 metres from the batter, who also      
 stands on a mat. The batter has to hit
 the ball, then try and run around the 
 four posts before the bowler gets the 
 ball back from the fielders. The posts
 are spaced out to make a kind of      
 square. When the batter goes all the  
 way round, that is a rounder. The     
 batter must stop at a post if the     
 bowler gets the ball back, or he will 
 be out. Fielders who catch the ball   
 can get you out, too. Sometimes we    
 play till the whole team is out,      
 sometimes we play so many minutes for 
 each team. I'm good at rounders.      </content>
