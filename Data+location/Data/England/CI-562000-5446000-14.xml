		<title>14TOURISTS IN ST.HELIER</title>
		<content>   There are many tourists in St.Helier
 all the year round. We made a survey  
 of 100 tourists in the main shopping  
 precinct and found that all except 2% 
 came from Britain; that 51% had never 
 been to Jersey before whereas 10% were
 here for at least the sixth time.     
 Over half the visitors stayed in      
 hotels and a further 25% in guest     
 houses. We were surprised to find that
 85% came to the island by air and only
 7% brought their cars on the boat.    
 Another surprise was how few (only    
 15%) had hired a car, the majority    
 seemed to be getting around on        
 foot, which suggests that they were   
 spending most of their time in the    
 town area.                            
  In answer to thhe question "Would you
 come again?" an overwhelming 96% said 
 that they would!
