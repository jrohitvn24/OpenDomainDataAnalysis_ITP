		<content>    In round figures, there are 1,500  
 houses and 5,000 people in the square 
 kilometre around Scott School.        
    The cost of the houses in this area
 varies from Â£27,000 to Â£75,000 but    
 prices are increasing each year       
 because of inflation and because of   
 the electrification of the rail link  
 with London two years ago. This has   
 increased Bedford's popularity with   
 commuters.                            
    However, in the school survey of   
 200 homes and 791 adults and children,
 only 17 adults worked daily in London.
    147 of the families lived in either
 a semi-detached or detached house with
 front and back gardens. These typical 
 houses have 3/4 bedrooms, a bathroom  
 with w.c., a second w.c., a living-   
 room, a kitchen/dining-area and a     
 garage. All have central heating and  
 bigger houses have en suite bathrooms.</content>
