All employed persons pay National      
Health Contributions which entitles    
all the population to free treatment by
doctor and hospital.  Prescriptions    
cost 2 pounds per item unless patient  
is a child, o.a.p. or unemployed etc.  
Nearest hospitals for surgery are at   
Milton Keynes (12 miles), Aylesbury    
(18).  Buckingham Cottage Hospital     
copes with short term, mainly elderly  
patients, consultations and clinics.   
Cancer is the most feared desease,     
although with early diagnosis is usua- 
lly curable - surgery is no longer the 
only answer.  The population is mainly 
healthy; the air is unpolluted; they   
have enough to eat.  Children are prone
to colds and tummy upsets, chicken pox,
German measles and occasionally mumps.
