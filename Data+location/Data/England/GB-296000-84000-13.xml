		<title>13Exton-Housing Development.</title>
		<content>Exton is now an affluent,low density   
village.The old focus was around the   
Exton farm in a sheltered valley.      
Building took place along the A376     
north towards Exeter ending at the old 
village school.This victorian          
development is varied including        
terraced houses,possibly for farm      
workers,and larger detached villas.    
Most prominent, however,is the         
mid-war infill between the A376 and    
the railway running by the estuary.    
These privately owned houses           
are mainly detached,individually       
designed and in extensive grounds.     
Recent building has been minimal       
merely filling-in spaces with          
houses of a similar price range.
