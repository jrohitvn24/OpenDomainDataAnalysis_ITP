		<title>15THE CUCKOO WALK, POLEGATE</title>
		<content> WHEN THE CUCKOO RAILWAY LINE RUNNING  
 FROM POLEGATE,NORTHWARDS TO LONDON VIA
 MANY SMALL E.SUSSEX AND KENT VILLAGES 
 CLOSED @1969 IT BECAME A LOVELY WALK. 
 THE{CUCKOO LINE} GOT ITS NAME FROM THE
 OLD CUCKOO FAIR HELD IN HEATHFIELD    
 EVERY APRIL, WHERE A CUCKOO WAS       
 RELEASED.THE RAILWAY LINE WAS OF GREAT
 BENEFIT TO THE AREA AND WAS GREATLY   
 MISSED WHEN IT CLOSED.                
 WHEN I WALKED DOWN THE CUCKOO WALK I  
 SAW 2 DEAD SHREWS,LOTS OF WASPS,      
 MAGPIES &amp; PIGEONS.I HEARD A NIGHTING- 
 GALE SINGING,A ROOK CROWING &amp; A HOUSE 
 MARTIN CATCHING A DRAGONFLY IN FLIGHT.
 ABOVE A BUSH AND ON A WIRE I SAW TWO  
 KESTRELS.THERE ARE MANY BIRDS AROUND. 
 AROUND THE WALK ARE FIELDS WITH LAMBS 
 AND HORSES AND YOU CAN SEE THE OLD    
 GATE AND RAILWAY CROSSING POSTS.I SAW 
 LITS OF FLOWERS -HONEYSUCKLE,BUTTERCUP
 POPPIES,WILD ROSES,DAISIES,DANDELIONS.</content>
