		<title>20CONSUMER SURVEY/CREDITS</title>
		<content> The{CONSUMER SURVEY}was delivered     
 during one day in June '85 in the     
 roads around{Whitmore High School}in  
{South Harrow.}The questionnaire was   
 designed by pupils doing Social       
 Studies and was delivered and often   
 collected on the same day.The results 
 are distorted because the sample was  
 partly self-selecting i.e.{mainly     
{those people at home during the day,  
 but many of the questions did include 
 those "out at work" in their answers  
 and its'results do seem to fairly     
 reflect the area.
