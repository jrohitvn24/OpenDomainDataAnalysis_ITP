		<title>14The man in grey.</title>
		<content> The landlord of The Plough Inn, Fen   
 Ditton, has two daughters, Julie and  
 Lisa Foster.                          
 When Julie was 2 she began to talk    
 of frequent visits to her bedroom by a
 kind man in a grey suit. When she was 
 4 the visits stopped.                 
 When Lisa was 2 she also began to talk
 of similar visits by a man in a grey  
 suit. When she was 4 she too stopped  
 reporting these visits.               
 Some years later a visiting friend was
 in the bar playing the juke box long  
 after the last customer had departed. 
 He said "Goodnight!" to a figure      
 passing behind him. Mr. Foster asked  
 him to whom he was talking and he     
 replied, "To the man who just went    
 out." But the door was locked! And the
 man had been wearing a grey suit!     
                                       
                                       </content>
