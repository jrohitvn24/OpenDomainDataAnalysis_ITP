		<title>11W.W.11 IN CHIPPING WARDEN</title>
		<content>Chipping Warden was a very small       
village until the second world war when
lots of Nisson huts were built for     
people to live in. Chipping Warden was 
chosen as an airfield and the nisson   
hut were for the airmen to live in.    
There was also a Naafi and a hospital. 
The NAAFI is now a smallholding. The   
stage of the hall is still there, in a 
barn. The hospital is now the school.  
The hangers on the aerodrome are now   
part of the industrial estate. The     
runways are still there. The nisson    
huts were in Culworth Road, one is now 
the football club's hut, Appletree Road
and on the main road. At the end of the
war, squatters moved into the houses on
the main road until Arbury Banks was   
built and families moved into those    
houses from the huts.
