		<title>10CHANGES IN BRIDGE SINCE 1953</title>
		<content> In the centre of Bridge there is an   
 estate called Western Avenue. It was  
 built in 1963 where Daddy Fagg's dairy
 farm was.Every year the Flower Show   
 was held in his field at which there  
 was a small fair. Opposite Daddy      
 Fagg's farm there was a Blacksmith's  
 Forge.It is now a private house.      
 There was a Riding School in the High 
 Street and a piano makers and tuners. 
 There were trees along the sides of   
 the High Street.                      
 From 1960 onwards more and more houses
 were built at Bridgedown, Bridgeford  
 Way, Riverside Close and Conyngham    
 Lane. This meant that new shops were  
 built. The new houses had garages     
 because by that time many people had  
 cars.Traffic through Bridge increased 
 and it became very dangerous,         
 especially the big lorries. The Bridge
 Bypass was opened in 1976.            </content>
