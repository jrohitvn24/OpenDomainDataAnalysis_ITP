		<title>07Glastonbury -New shops</title>
		<content> Many of the townspeople are dissatis- 
 fied with the quality of the shops in 
 Glastonbury. Too many shops appear to 
 be geared to the tourist trade,       
 expensive dress shops and others with 
 a strong bias towards the occult and  
 mystical aspects of the town. A petit-
 ion has been circulated for a new     
 supermarket.  It was pointed out that 
 at present there is only one, and with
 two other small private grocery stores
 there is generally little competition 
 -resulting in possibly higher prices. 
 A ten year old child pointed out that 
 at present it is a hard climb to the  
 top of the town for an elderly person 
 living in Benedict Street or Paradise 
 Estate.  The existing supermarket has 
 poor parking facilities and it is felt
 that there should be a greater and    
 cheaper range of shopping facilities.
