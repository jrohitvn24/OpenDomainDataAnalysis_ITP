		<title>05PICNIC PARK NEAR ARUNDEL</title>
		<content> Four roads form a roundabout at a high
 point on the South Downs called       
 "Whiteways" after the nearby entrance 
 lodge to Arundel Park. A car park, a  
 picnic area, snack bar and toilets    
 cater for the needs of the motorist   
 and the walker, and the latter can    
 wander with little restriction in the 
 woods to the northwest and the Park to
 the southeast. A flint-built lodge    
 spans the red gate which gives access 
 to the park which consists of natural 
 woods, plantations and open downland. 
 To the west of the downhill road to   
 Arundel lie the Rewell Woods, owned by
 the Norfolk Estates, consisting of    
 plantations of conifers and long      
 stretches of deciduous trees. Large   
 earthworks span the north end of the  
 road near Whiteways. Many lovely views
 delight the traveller.
