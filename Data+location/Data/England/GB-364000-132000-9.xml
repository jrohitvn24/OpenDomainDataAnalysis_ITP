		<title>09 GANT'S MILL BRUTON.</title>
		<content>    Gant's Mill was built on the       
River Brue.Gants mill was probably     
not built until 1290.Its name came     
from John le Gaunt of Bruton.We        
presume he was the original builder.   
The early history is recorded in       
documents which were passed down to    
the Helyar family.They are preserved   
in Somerset Records Office.            
    Gants Mill was probably one of the 
earliest fulling mills in the country. 
In the 17th century it became a        
cornmill as the woollen industry then  
moved north.Gant's Mill was converted  
to a flour and grist mill and leased to
Mr John Lockyer,a miller from Sanford  
Orcas.For four generations the Lockyer 
fly operated the flour mill and animal 
feeding business.                      
   Gant's Mill was sold to the present 
owners by John Lockyer in 1949.
