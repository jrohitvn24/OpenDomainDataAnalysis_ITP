		<title>02FARMING NEAR SITTINGBOURNE 1</title>
		<content> The majority of the land is used for  
 the production of fruit and           
 vegetables. Although there are a few  
 smallholdings most of the farms are   
 owned by one farmer. West Tonge Farm  
 produces winter wheat, main crop and  
 early potatoes, corn, spring greens,  
 runner beans and barley. Machinery    
 helps with some of the necessary work:
 preparing the soil, sowing the seeds  
 and harvesting the crops. A great deal
 is harvested by hand at the moment as 
 this causes less damage to the crop   
 and ensures better quality, but high  
 wage bills are causing cuts in the    
 work force and more harvesting        
 machinery is being introduced. The    
 vegetables are graded after           
 harvesting. The first class vegetables
 are sent to local supermarkets, the   
 rest are sent to London wholesale     
 markets.                              </content>
