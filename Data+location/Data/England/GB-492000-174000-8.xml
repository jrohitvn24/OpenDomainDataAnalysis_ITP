		<title>08Employment Survey cont.</title>
		<content> 3) 91.8% were in{Tertiary Industry,   
 which is providing a service. We      
 divided this into 2 categories:       
  a) Service to a factory or commercial
 organisation e.g. secretary,          
 warehouse foreman  (30.9%)            
  b) Service to the general public e.g.
 hairdresser, civil servant (60.9%).   
  57% of parents have daily journeys of
 0 - 3 miles, 19% between 3 - 10 miles 
 and 24% more then 10 miles. Many      
 parents in the 1st group work in      
{Slough,}the 2nd group includes parents
 working at{Heathrow Airport}and the   
 3rd group includes{London}commuters.  
  We checked the replies to the survey 
 and found that in 17% of the homes    
 both parents had full-time jobs and in
 64% one parent had a full-time job and
 one a part-time job.                  
  We realise that we are very lucky in 
 this area to avoid unemployment.      </content>
