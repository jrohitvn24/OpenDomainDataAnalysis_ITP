		<title>09TALKING TO PEOPLE</title>
		<content>      People seem to be very happy     
 living in Sedbergh on the whole and   
 they are content with the limited     
 facilities available.  They either    
 make do with what is here or go to    
 Kendal where there is a much larger   
 choice of activities.                 
      We talked to one lady who said   
 that Sedbergh is standing still and   
 there is no future for the young      
 people here unless they go into       
 farming.                              
      Many people did not like the     
 large number of tourists who visit    
 Sedbergh in the summer, mainly because
 of the closure of useful shops to be  
 replaced by gift shops and other      
 tourist amenities.  Several people    
 were afraid that there were plans to  
 develope a trunk road through the     
 town.                                 
                                       </content>
