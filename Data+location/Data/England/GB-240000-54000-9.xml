    On Friday May 24th, Mr.Steven      
 Madge,the well known naturalist and   
 ornitholgist, came to give us a talk  
 on the wildlife of the area around    
 Torpoint.                             
    We are fortunate to have a very    
 mild climate owing to the fact that   
 the Gulf Stream runs close to the     
 shore.This means that the temperature 
 at sea level almost never falls below 
 freezing,so many plants grow here that
 could not grow anywhere else.Our      
 seashore area has 2 large esturaies of
 the Lynher and Tamar rivers with      
 there entensive mudflats which provide
 enormous quantities of food for wading
 and other water birds.This means there
 is a varied resident population which 
 includes Robins and Blackbirds which  
 are migratory in colder climates.     </content>
