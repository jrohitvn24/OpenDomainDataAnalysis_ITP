		<title>12BRIEF HISTORY CURY/GUNWALLOE</title>
		<content>     The area was first inhabited by   
 Celts about 700 B.C. Roman occupation 
 followed but had little influence on  
 life in the area. Later monks and     
 missionaries from Ireland and Breton  
 entered the area. The Lizard Peninsula
 became a refuge for leprosy victims of
 the Crusades.(The word Lizard possible
 coming from the word'Lazare'disease). 
 Sir Roger Carminoe also returned from 
 the Crusades having fought with Prince
 Edward in 1270.The present Carminoe   
 Farm is all that remains of the former
 Manor with its Manorial/Feudal system 
 which presided over the area for      
 centuries.The words Cury and Gunwalloe
 probably derive from the Cornish      
 Language meaning 'Boundary' and 'Open 
 land'. The area was also famous for   
 smugglers and wreckers. A famous      
 character being one Henry Cuttance of 
 Gunwalloe and innkeeper of Halzephron.</content>
