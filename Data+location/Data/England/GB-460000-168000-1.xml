		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the designated area lies in   
 the valley between the rivers Bourne  
 and Kennet. This is an area of flat   
 ground which had the river-gravel     
 extracted before the 1939-45 war and  
 is now used for cereal production. The
 village of Sulhamstead lies on the    
 side of a hill in the south-east of   
 the sector. The area has traditionally
 been important as part of the         
 transport network of southern England.
 The river Kennet was used to transport
 goods to the river Thames until the   
 canal was built in the 1790's. When   
 the Great Western Railway was built in
 the 1840's the canal and river fell   
 into disuse as a means of transport.  
 Throughout this period the Great West 
 Road has carried people and goods from
 London towards Bath and Bristol. In   
 1985 the A4 is the dominant feature of
 the area.                             </content>
