		<content> Most homes have parents and children, 
 usually about 2 children per          
 house. Most families live in houses.  
 Most houses are new and are gas       
 centrally heated. There are 3         
 bedrooms, 1 kitchen, a bathroom and a 
 living room in a typical house. Some  
 people have dining rooms and some have
 utility rooms.                        
  Many people have electric washing    
 machines which wash clothes in hot    
 water. We hang them on a line to dry  
 again. Most parents go to work. We    
 have freezers which keep food fresh   
 for a long time. These are very       
 useful. Refrigerators keep food cool. 
 All houses have cookers. Some have    
 microwaves. We like to watch T.V. We  
 have 4 channels to choose from. We    
 have videos, which record T.V.        
 programmes.
