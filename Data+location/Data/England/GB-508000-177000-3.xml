		<content>  Cranford Park has had a church since 
 before the Domesday Book because the  
 book shows what the priest owned.The  
 church originally belonged to the     
 Knights of St.John.It was called      
 Cranford St.John.In the church is the 
 tomb of the first lady Berkley and one
 for a man called Aston,who was Keeper 
 of the Wardrobe to James 1.His tomb   
 shows him and his family praying.In   
 the nave there is a hatchment which   
 was hung up on a house if a member of 
 the family died.It would be carried in
 the funeral procession and then put in
 the local church.The chancel and the  
 tower were built in the 14th century. 
 The nave was burnt down and rebuilt in
 about 1715 in brick.The rest of the   
 church is made of flint and pudding-  
 stone.The oldest bell is dated about  
 1380.It is still used today.
