		<title>13Dunton Village.</title>
		<content>   The High Street consists of mainly  
 council houses. In the past there were
 farm houses but these have now been   
 converted.There are new private       
 dwellings infilling the village. The  
 High Street has the local post        
 office/general store, the cemetery and
 primary school in it.                 
   The primary school has 34 children  
 and 3 teachers. The building has been 
 modernised since the war but mobile   
 classrooms are still used.            
   Although Dunton is a small village, 
 it has a heavy flow of traffic. In a  
 fifteen minute traffic survey, 40     
 cars, 6 lorries and 6 vans passed     
 through the village.                  
   People in Dunton said it was a quiet
 and pleasant village to live in. The  
 younger generations however thought it
 lacked evening activities.
