		<title>19ST.MICHAEL'S HARVEST SUPPER</title>
		<content> About 90 people attend the annual     
 Harvest Supper. The 4 course meal is  
 prepared by members of St. Michaels   
 congregation. After supper, guests    
 enter church which is decorated with  
 flowers and produce. Local singers    
 then give a concert. The pleasant     
 evening gives everyone the opportunity
 to see a local church in all its glory
 for its Patronal Festival, on Sept.   
 29th. in 1985.                        
  Over Â£300 was raised from the 1985   
 supper. Money is urgently needed for  
 the repair of the church steeple.     
 Structural damage will cost Â£7000 to  
 put right. This has been the first    
 major concern for the new vicar, Rev. 
 Neil Russell, whose induction took    
 place at St. Marys on Sept.11th 1985.
