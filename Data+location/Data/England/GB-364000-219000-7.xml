		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> I live on a farm.We have cows and     
 sheep.I woke early yesterday on a fine
 Spring morning to find that father was
 busy with the milking of our herd of  
 Friesan cows.Before I had my breakfast
 I went out with my mother to feed some
 of the new lambs especially those born
 overnight which were orphans.Sometimes
 I have to rub the newly born lambs    
 very hard to generate warmth or they  
 would die.Breakfast over it is only a 
 very short walk with my younger       
 brother to the village school along   
 the A 40 road.Yesterday I came home   
 about 4 p.m. I took some of my school 
 friends with me.They fed my pony and  
 the lambs with me .After they had gone
 home I went to help my father with the
 planting of potatoes in the fields.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
