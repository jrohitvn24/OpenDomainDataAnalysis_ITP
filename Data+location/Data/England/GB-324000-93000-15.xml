		<content> The only factory in this area is      
 Hoechst CeramTec, a German company.   
 They make fuses from clay. Waste clay 
 is added to water and put through a   
 drum mixer, agitator, filter press and
 vacuum press to produce raw clay that 
 can be used for moulding into the     
 right shape for different fuses. This 
 is done on presses. The result is then
 put in a kiln at 630-820 degrees C. It
 is then cut to size. Then they are put
 through kilns at 1300 dgrees C. They  
 are taken to the grinders, which grind
 75000 fuses in the 8 hours that the   
 workers work each day. They are then  
 washed, dried and tumbled for 2 to 102
 hours depending on the fuse. They are 
 then checked. Some are coated with    
 silicon, others have their ends coated
 with silver. They are packed and sent 
 all over the world.
