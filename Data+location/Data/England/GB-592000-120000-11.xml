		<content>  THE RAFT RACE:Every summer a 1\-mile 
 -long raft race is held on the river. 
 It starts at the Strand turning and   
 finishes at the harbour. There are    
 usually about 35 entries. Some of it  
 is for charity. It is very funny and a
 nice occasion, with some rafts looking
 very strange and people wearing       
 amusing costumes. There is a prize at 
 the end,but taking part is much more  
 important.                            
  BONFIRE CELEBRATIONS:Every year on a 
 Saturday around Guy Fawkes' day the   
 Rye Bonfire Society organises a       
 torchlight procession through the     
 streets to the salts where the bonfire
 is lit. Bonfire societies from other  
 towns take part and each group dresses
 in fantastic costumes to do with its  
 chosen theme.
