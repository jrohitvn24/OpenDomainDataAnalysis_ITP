		<title>02WESTROP PLAYGROUP,HIGHWORTH</title>
		<content> The Playgroup was founded by a group  
 of Mums in 1973. The grounds,roughly  
 an acre,are rented from the council,  
 and the building is owned by the      
 Playgroup Committee. Only thirty      
 children are allowed in the playgroup 
 at any one time.They go either in the 
 morning or in the afternoon. There are
 three paid workers and four voluntary 
 workers every session. The age of the 
 children varies from three to five    
 years old. The children don't have    
 their lunch there,only a glass        
 of milk in the morning or afternoon.  
 They have a few small trips,and,once  
 a year,a bigger trip. The Playgroup   
 runs on the children. It costs 80p    
 for a morning and 70p for an          
 afternoon. They also have other events
 to raise money such as sales,fetes    
 and sponsored trike rides.
