		<title>11WINGATE OPEN AIR MARKET</title>
		<content> Wingate market is an open air market  
 held weekly (Thursday) on a piece of  
 waste land behind Front Street,       
 Wingate.It is a "new" market because  
 it has only been operating for 15     
 months.The most popular stalls are    
 clothes stalls.One lady interviewed   
 said that clothes stalls were popular 
 because of the reasonably priced      
 clothes. A 'cleaning' stall also had  
 many customers and also a shoe        
 stall which had a good selection of   
 cheap shoes for both young and old.   
 The people who go to this market are  
 quite old and rarely shop out of      
 Station Town or Wingate.The reason    
 they shop at the  market is because   
 of the variety of stalls, and also it 
 is within walking distance of their   
 homes as many of them do not have cars
 and rely on public transport.
