		<content> Our block is between the towns of     
 Gravesend and Strood. Most of our area
 is farmland and orchards. There are   
 two villages within the block, Higham 
 and Shorne. During the past fifty     
 years Higham has developed greatly as 
 a residential area. Shorne, however,  
 has fought to remain a small country  
 village. In Higham there is a railway 
 station which is used mainly by       
 commuters. There are three old saxon  
 churches in the area. In each village 
 there is a primary school and also a  
 village hall. Most people use Strood  
 and Gravesend for shopping, though    
 there are a number of local shops.    
  In the last ten years the area has   
 attracted a lot of commuters. The     
 attraction of village life combined   
 with the easy access to all facilities
 has made it a popular area to live.
