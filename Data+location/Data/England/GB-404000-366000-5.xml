        The River Dove                 
Map ref.032684                         
The River Dove starts on Axe Edge in   
the corner of a farmers field.First it 
 just a bog,the water seeps down the   
hill and forms a little brook which    
flows quite fast.Further down the stone
changed to shale,the brook got wider   
and faster rushing and tumbling over   
little rapids and waterfalls.An        
angler called Charles Cotten fished in 
the Dove.Lots of little streams run    
into the river.In the valley it is     
 warm because it is sheltered.There    
are lots of trees and bushes then it   
starts to curve in big loops and       
curves,and the shale sides are very    
slippery,shallow and stoey.The steep   
banks were formed by the river.After   
the shale banks is Hopping Bridge the  
old pack horse bridge.                 </content>
