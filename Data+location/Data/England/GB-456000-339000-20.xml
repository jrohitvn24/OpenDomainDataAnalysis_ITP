		<title>20NOTTINGHAM  SALVATION ARMY</title>
		<content> I live at the Salvation Army next door
 to William Booth's house where he was 
 born.He started the Salvation Army to 
 look after people who need help.My Dad
 takes the old people shopping in the  
 Salvation Army ambulance.My mum cleans
 in our house and sings on Sundays.    
 Sometimes at the meetings with Dad    
 they talk about God and Jesus.A lot   
 of old peole live in the old folks    
 home because they can't do anything   
 for themselves so some young ladies   
 make their dinner and look after them.
 When people's houses go on fire       
 sometimes they can live for a few     
 months in a flat in the Salvation     
 Army. My friend Jason lives in a flat 
 and I play with him.When there is a   
 fire my Dad and Captain Halliday go   
 with some sandwiches and drink for    
 them.                                 
                                       </content>
