 Some farms have land allocated for    
 "pick-your-own"sales of fruits and    
 vegetables.Many people come from      
{Lincoln}and the surrounding villages  
 when the weather is fine to enjoy a   
 day in the country where they pick and
 purchase their fruit.                 
  People in our villages travel into   
{Lincoln}to do their shopping in the   
 big super markets but purchase local  
 produce from the farms.               
  There are also a few trout and and   
 fish farms which breed fish and charge
 people to come and fish in their      
 lakes.                                
  At{Scothern}there is a comercial     
 plant nursery.In{Sudbrooke}people have
 started selling the very peaty soil.
