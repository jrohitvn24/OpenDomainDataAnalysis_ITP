		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</title>
		<content> The area, studied by top infants and  
 top juniors, is on the west side of   
 Shrewsbury, stretching from Bowbrook  
 to Porthill in the south; from Bicton 
 to Berwick in the north. It includes  
 Copthorne, The Mount, Porthill,       
 Shelton, Bicton and Bicton Heath.     
 The south-east corner  of  the area is
 a residential suburb of Shrewsbury. To
 the north and west there are isolated 
 dwellings in the midst of agricultural
 land, which makes up 75% of our block.
 The A5 road crosses the area in a     
 south-east/north-west direction, with 
 the A458 and B4386 extending          
 westwards.                            
 In the north-east corner of the block 
 the River Severn cuts through the     
 relatively flat land. There is no     
 major industry here, the main         
 employers being the hospital and      
 Water Authority at Shelton.           </content>
