 We surveyed the whole first year at   
 Stanley High School. Here are the top 
 ten games in order of                 
 preference.1.Tig, 2.Football,3.Tennis,
 4.Cricket, 5.Hide and Seek,6.Various  
 ball games,7.Britishbulldogs,8.Walley,
 9.Rounders,10.Monopoly.               
   These are only the top ten games,   
  there were many more.The top game is 
 described below                       
   TIG had 129 votes, the object of    
 this game is to have as many players  
 as you want.Someone is to             
 be'it'(tigger). Everybody runs away   
 and the tigger counts to ten, after he
 or she has counted the tigger runs    
 after them.If one person is caught    
 that person is it.Another form of tig 
 is where the person counts to ten and 
 runs after everyone.When a person is  
 caught three times that person is it. </content>
