		<title>13Job Survey</title>
		<content>The basic industries of our area are   
coal mining and farming. However these 
2 industries account for only 5% of all
jobs. Most people are connected with   
the Port of Dover. Over 65% of these   
people are employed with the Cross     
Ferry Companies (Townsed's, Sealink),  
HM Customs (immigration &amp; cutoms) or as
import/export clerks with the many     
shipping companies in the town. Most of
the remaining 30% are also 'service'   
industries, ie nursing, hairdressing,  
shop assistants, civil servants,       
secretarial and receptionist work. Only
2% of all the people interviewed were  
self-employed and these were either    
painters and decorators or general     
builders. None of the interviewed      
actually worked in Whitfield itself. We
therfore conclude that the village is  
basically a "dormitory". We found very 
little evidence of unemployment.       </content>
