		<title>02Mr.Watson and the E.E.C.</title>
		<content>   Mr.Watson is a farmer on Newlands   
 Farm.He is past president of the      
 N.F.U.and is now the regional member  
 of the Milk Marketing Board.He knows a
 lot about modern farming and he told  
 us his part in this industry.         
   He explained the agricultural policy
 of the E.E.C. Until 10 years ago the  
 goverment fixed the prices of most    
 farm commodites but now the E.E.C.    
 guarantees a basic price for most     
 things.He is a dairy farmer so he     
 sells to the Milk Marketing Board. If 
 the milk is not sold then the E.E.C.  
 stores it in Europe but he still gets 
 a guaranteed payment.He said that to  
 stop producing too much milk,farmers  
 had to base their milk production on  
 1983 figures.This is called the quota 
 system.The farmers have reduced herds 
 or milk,Mr.Watson has used both       
 methods.                              </content>
