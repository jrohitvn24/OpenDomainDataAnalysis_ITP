		<title>08Folk Festival in Wimborne</title>
		<content> The fourth Wimborne Folk Festival took
 place from 7th to 9th June, l985.     
 There was a procession through the    
 town with twenty four different groups
 of performers including many local    
 morrismen.  The morrismen danced in   
 the Square and around the Cornmarket. 
 The ladies wore patchwork clothes in  
 red and white and the men had red     
 trousers and white shirts.  They had  
 bells around their wrists and ankles  
 which made a nice jingle as they      
 danced and they used sticks in their  
 dance.  Men were playing drums,       
 trumpets, violins and an accordian.   
 Some groups came from as far as       
 Somerset, Lancashire and Kent. There  
 were song sessions, a street market   
 and ceilidhs taking place all over the
 town and various activities were held 
 at the Allendale Centre.  The event   
 was sponsored by Two Counties Radio.  </content>
