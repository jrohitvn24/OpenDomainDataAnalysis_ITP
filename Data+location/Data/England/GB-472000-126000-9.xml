		<content>{HUMPHREY HOLDINGS}is a poultry farm.It
 occupies a 5 acre site at Steep Marsh 
 and is part of HH Ltd,Winchester.The  
 site was formerly owned by Mr D.Ryder.
 He used it mainly for poultry farming 
 also.Ryder now owns "Farmfax" next    
 door.Humphrey Holdings sells some of  
 the eggs it produces in its shop, and 
 some locally, but the vast bulk of    
 production (35,000 eggs, three times a
 week) goes to Thames Valley Eggs,at   
 Headcorn,Kent.There are 45,000 pullets
 at the farm,(from day old chics to 18 
 weeks), and over 60,000 laying birds. 
 The laying period for a hen is from   
 the 18th to 76th week. There are three
 main sheds,each 200' by 50'.Each      
 contains about 18,000 birds.Hens live 
 four to a cage. There is very little  
 room to move inside. They're fed 8    
 times a day by conveyor belt,and water
 is always available.(Cont - next page)</content>
