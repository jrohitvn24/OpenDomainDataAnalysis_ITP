		<title>09Wykham Mill :Banbury</title>
		<content>Wykham Mill is in the valley of {Sor   
Brook}. It is roughly {half-way between
Banbury and Bloxham}. It is used now   
to make {animal feed}. Ten people work 
there when all the staff are there.    
Wykham Mill supplies animal feed to the
Midlands and {seed corn} to the whole  
country. There are some machines but   
not many as it is not fully  automatic.
Men still have to do all the bagging   
work. The mill also sell {fertiliser   
and sprays}. They still have an {old   
water wheel} that turns when the brook 
is flooded. The mill is now owned by   
Lamprey &amp; Son.
