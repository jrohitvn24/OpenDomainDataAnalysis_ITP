		<title>01COXHEATH - GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Coxheath area is mostly estate    
 housing built in the last twenty years
 and most properties are               
 owner-occupied.  Outside the housing  
 area most of the land is fruit farming
 land.  In the eastern part of the area
 is the village of Loose.  This is a   
 lower stretch of land and has a much  
 older selection of buildings.         
                                       
 Coxheath was an army camp at about the
 time of the Napoleonic wars but there 
 is no longer an army connection with  
 the area with the possible exception  
 of a troop review by the {Duke of     
{York}of  10000 soldiers on August     
 20th. 1804 which could have led to the
 nursery rhyme.
