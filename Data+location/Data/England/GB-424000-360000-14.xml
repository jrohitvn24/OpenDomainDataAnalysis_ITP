		<content>  The areas of Winster, Birchover and  
 Stanton are situated in moorland and  
 some woodland which is part of the    
 Southernmost tip of the Pennines.     
 General altitude is 750 - 1000. It is 
 an area of gritstone and limestone    
 outcrops interdispersed with          
 crystaline mineral deposits. There    
 are many quarries in the gritstone    
 areas and the limestone area is       
 littered with mineshafts sunk         
 principally for lead. At one time     
 Enthovens was one of the largest lead 
 mines in Western Europe.              
 Birchover and Winster are small very  
 old settlements nesting in the lee of 
 hillsides.                            
 The area's natural beauty and its     
 location in the Peak National Park    
 throughout the year ensure a steady   
 stream of tourists and people seeking 
 outdoor pursuits.                     </content>
