  The picture which emerges at the dawn
of the "Early modern" era is a village 
of widely scattered farmsteads, set in 
broad wooded pastures, and with no     
clearly defined centre as such. The    
yeomen derived their living from cattle
farming, particularly dairying, with   
cereal production (mainly wheat) as a  
sideline. This system of farming was   
already well established by the end of 
the fifteenth century, and continued   
with very little change until the      
Napoleonic wars swung the pendulum     
abruptly and, as it transpired,        
irrevocably, to the plough.
