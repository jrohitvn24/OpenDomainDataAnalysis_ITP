		<title>09The Market</title>
		<content> There has been a market in Market     
 Harborough ever since 1204.It used    
 to be held in the middle of the       
 street. The market nowadays is inside 
 a market hall. It is divided into two 
 sections. The first part is fairly    
 small and is mainly fresh food stalls.
 The second part,the cattle market,has 
 lots of different sorts of animal     
 pens.They sell pigs, sheep and        
 cattle.There are about 100 pigs on    
 sale each week.The number of sheep    
 depends on the season.Some times there
 are as many as 1500.After the end of  
 June there may be as many as 300      
 cattle sent to the market. People in  
 villages nearby come to shop, because 
 it gives them a better choice of food 
 and other goods.Today shops in Market 
 Harborough are mainly family          
 businesses but there are some big     
 chain stores e.g. Tesco,&amp; the Co-op.  </content>
