 inside and do a spelling test until   
 2.40, then we do the spellings we got 
 wrong on the blackboard till about

{Crispin's Day At School }             
 I usually leave home at 8.30 and      
 either walk or ride in the car to     
 school. When I reach school I prepare 
 for lessons and play with my friends  
 until 9.00. after assembly we do Maths
 board work until the first playtime   
 which lasts 15 minutes. After play we 
 do geography from text books for an   
 hour until lunch at 12.00. After lunch
 in the hall , or outside if it's fine 
 , we play until 1.30, then we do      
 history . At the moment we are        
 studying Saxons . We have a play break
 then we go into the hall and rehearse 
 our plays until hometime at 3.30.     </content>
