		<title>04The Mayor of Hereford.</title>
		<content>   In July we went to see the{Mayor.   
 His name is Mr.Stroucken but we had to
 call him Mr.Mayor.A Mayor is the      
{Chairman}of the{City Council.}The City
 is divided into 9 wards. Three people 
 represent each ward which makes 27    
 people altogether. At the end of      
 January one person is chosen to be    
 Mayor and Chairman of the City Council
 and takes office in May. The previous 
 Mayor becomes{Deputy Mayor.           
   There has been a Mayor in Hereford  
 since 1833. Our Mayor is the 604th to 
 serve the city.                       
   When they have Committee meetings   
 the Councillors sit at a horse-shoe   
 shaped table. The Mayor has completely
 free access to the{Town Hall.         
   When one of the{Royal Family}comes  
 to Hereford the Mayor is the first    
 person to meet them.
