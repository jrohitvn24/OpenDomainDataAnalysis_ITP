		<content>      Local farms are mixed, of l00-300
 acres and worked by the family with   
 some extra labour at harvest, or with 
 contractors.                          
      The preferred breeds seem        
 to be Hereford-Freisan crosses and    
 Suffolk sheep.  Cattle are left out   
 all year.  One farm has pigs also and 
 there is one intensive pig farm.      
 Poultry are kept for family needs     
 mostly.  Crop and pasture ratios vary.
 Grass is grown more for hay than      
 silage and crops are rotated to       
 produce cereals,swedes, sugar beet and
 potatoes.                             
      E.E.C. regulations appear to have
 little effect but have restricted     
 choices, e.g. milk quotas.  Most      
 farmers use the Marketing Boards for  
 potatoes,wool and milk and transport  
 stock,for up to l00 miles. Beet is    
 transported to factories by a set date</content>
