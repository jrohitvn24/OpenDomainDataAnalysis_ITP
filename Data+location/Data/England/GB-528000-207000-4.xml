		<title>04L' Berkhamsted War Memorial.</title>
		<content>  As in villages all over the country ,
 this was erected by the parishioners  
 in 1918,in memory of the villagers who
 lost their lives in the{Great War.    
  The stone cross is set on a          
 triangular grass base,in the centre of
 the village,at the junction of Church 
 Road and Little Berkhamsted Lane.The  
 memorial is maintained voluntarily by 
 Mr.Vingo who lives on Church Road.    
  The inscription is{"Faithful unto    
{Death",}and underneath on three of the
 six panels are written the nine names 
 of those who lost their lives.        
  In 1945, seven more names were added,
  and the words "The following made the
 supreme sacrifice for the cause of    
 freedom and justice"                  
{ The Parish Council}is responsible for
 its care.
