		<title>06A mothers day in Stratton</title>
		<content> 7am start gives just enough time to   
 rise, throw on jeans and sweat shirt, 
 descend to kitchen and start preparing
 lunch boxes for husband and two       
 children who shortly appear for       
 porridge and toast.  They are off to  
 school by 8.10 leaving me plus baby to
 tackle household chores.  Hopefully   
 someone appears for coffee around 11. 
 If it is to be a good day, will manage
 a beer in pub at lunchtime (the local 
 is very obliging about baby, who sits 
 on the floor with a packet of crisps).
  Afternoon walk is a must.            
 Children arrive home about 4.30 On    
 organised days supper appears on the  
 table around 5.30 Normally I do not   
 have time to digest mine before taking
 a child Cubs,Brownies or ballet by    
 car. Once children are home, bathed   
 and in bed will unwind hopefully with 
 aid of large gin.                     </content>
