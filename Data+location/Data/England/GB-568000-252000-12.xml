		<title>12Employment in Cowlinge</title>
		<content>                                       
There are no industries in the village,
hence all those of working age have to 
seek employment outside the area. They 
range from proffessional people to     
artisans. Agricultural workers, however
are employed on the seceral farms which
surround Cowlinge. Unemployment is very
low. There are two small businesses, an
all-purpose shop with petrol pump run  
byone man, and a good building and     
painting trade. There is some business 
transacted at the post office, and one 
public house is sufficient for all     
needs.
