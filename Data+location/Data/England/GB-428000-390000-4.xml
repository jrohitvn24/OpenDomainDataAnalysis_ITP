 In Loxley there are two estates of    
 new houses, mainly detached but there 
 is a mix of bungalows and some        
 semi_detached as well. Near the school
 there is an estate of brick built     
 detached houses about 12 years old.   
 They are joined by their garages. At  
 the other side of the school there are
 bungalows for old people with a       
 warden, brick built flats which were  
 built about 1980, old terraced and new
 town houses, semi_detached old and    
 new.Some old ones were built about    
 1900. Some are council houses and some
 are  privately owned. Most of the     
 houses have fairly large gardens.     
 There are a number of older stone     
 built houses in the area.
