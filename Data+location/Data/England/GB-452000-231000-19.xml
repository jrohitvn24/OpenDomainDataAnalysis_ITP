		<title>19SOCIAL LIFE IN CROUGHTON 3</title>
		<content> Organisations such as the Friends of  
 Croughton School, Church and          
 Conservatives hold Cheese and Wine and
 other Social Evenings with Food to    
 raise money. Croughton is known for   
 providing good refreshments! The same 
 group of sixty or so people are nearly
 always present at all these functions.
 The fact that every family has a car  
 means that opeople do not rely on the 
 village for entertainment as they used
 to.  In addition, the increased       
 mobility of families means that many  
 people visit relatives at weekends,   
 and the weekly shopping expedition is 
 common, either to nearby towns or     
 further afield to Milton Keynes or    
 Oxford.
