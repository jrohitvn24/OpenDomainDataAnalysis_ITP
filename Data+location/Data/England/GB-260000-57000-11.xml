		<title>11Cornwood School</title>
		<content> Cornwood,mentioned in the Domesday    
 Book as Cornehuda,a manor,has approx. 
 1OOO souls(this number not having     
 altered much over the years) In 1859 a
 church school was erected in the      
 centre of the village,by the Rev. Duke
 Yonge. The school has undergone many  
 changes,including the incorporation of
 the attached headmaster's house into  
 the school,and the building of a      
 swimming pool in the school garden.   
 Today the school has 3 classes:infants
 lower and upper juniors, and a total  
 of between 7O-8O pupils. Some children
 are bused in from nearby Lee Moor,    
 where the local school recently       
 closed.After many years of protest and
 letter-writing the school's outdoor   
 toilets are to be rebuilt and attached
 to the main building by a covered way.
 Cornwood school serves the Ivybridge  
 Comprehensive/Community College.      </content>
