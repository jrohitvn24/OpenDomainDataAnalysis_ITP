		<content> Farmland dominates the area around    
 Brightwell Baldwin and Upperton.  Most
 of the land still belongs to the      
 Roadnihts Farm in Britwell.  However, 
 Brihtwell Farm has been farmed by a   
 local family for about fifty years.   
 They were tenant farmers for the first
 thirty years, and then bought the land
 from the Roadnights arm in 1942.  When
 they first bought the farm it was a   
 dairy farm, but about ten years ago it
 chaned to a beef farm.  the old,      
 disussed milking parlour and barns can
 still be seen.  The farm has about    
 forty to fifty beef cows. The calves  
 are sold in Reading market in the     
 Autumn.  There are three different    
 breeds of cattle on the farm,         
 short-horn crosses, Fresians and      
 Herefords.
