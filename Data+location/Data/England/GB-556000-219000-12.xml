		<title>12FARMING AND AGRICULTURE</title>
		<content> The whole of our area, apart from the 
 villages, is used for agriculture.    
 This is mainly arable farming with    
 large crops of wheat, barley, rape,   
 beans, peas and grass.  There are a   
 few farms which do have animals but   
 these are mainly kept for the farmers'
 own needs.  Three nurseries have      
 developed, each specialising in       
 different produce.  At Smiths Green   
 the nursery grows tomatoes and        
 cucumbers, at Hope End they           
 concentrate on house plants and at    
 Langthorns, unusual shrubs and        
 heathers.  In season, other small home
 based outlets emerge along the A120 as
 people sell flowers and produce to the
 passing motorists.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
