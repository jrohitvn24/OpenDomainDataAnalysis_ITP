		<title>07LOSS OF VILLAGE AMENITIES</title>
		<content>  In recent years the village of Alkham
 has lost many local amenities, a once 
 thriving community has become a       
 picturesque dormitory for Folkestone  
 and Dover. The village school has     
 closed, junior children now travel to 
 Capel. One of the two village public  
 houses has shut down. The local vicar 
 has moved to Capel because the        
 sprawling vicarage was uneconomic to  
 run. The local Squire has died, his   
 mansion is now only a weekend home for
 his sons. Bus services have been      
 slashed and the local shop and post   
 office have been closed, with only a  
 temporary post office service provided
 in the Village Hall. Extra work for   
 villagers was lost when farming       
 expansion was banned and planners have
 refused new building schemes which    
 would have increased the population   
 and consequent support of amenities.  </content>
