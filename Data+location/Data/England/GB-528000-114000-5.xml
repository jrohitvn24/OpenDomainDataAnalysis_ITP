		<title>05Hurstpierpoint Theatre</title>
		<content>  At the eastern end of Hurstpierpoint 
 High Street is the{theatre.}It was    
 built around 1894 as an Evangelical   
 chapel, and since then it has been a  
 school, a wire store, a grocer's and a
 supermarket. It was empty for four    
 years, and then it was bought by      
 Hurstpierpoint players. After numerous
{fund_raising events}and the selling   
 off of two kiosks at the front of the 
 building, the money was raised for    
 sets, stage lights, a bar, proper     
 curtains and about 90 seats.          
  The first of many performancies at   
 the theatre was a review called{      
{"Consider Yourself at Home".          
  Let us hope that the theatre will    
 still be here to entertain people for 
 many more years to come.
