		<title>04Education in the Felton Area</title>
		<content> Before 1972 the children of this area 
 were educated in two small church     
 schools.  The reception class was held
 at Ullingswick and the two classes of 
 older children were at Preston Wynne. 
 At the age of eleven the children     
 transfered to Bromyard Secondary      
 School.  After 1972 all children up to
 the age of eleven went to the new     
 Burley Gate Church of England Primary 
 School.  This school now has 135      
 pupils in 6 classes.  There are five  
 teaching staff and a head-mistress.   
 Four ancillary workers and two        
 cleaners are employed.  The children  
 are brought by bus from within a      
 radius of six miles.  The subjects    
 taught are English, Mathematics,      
 Science, History, Geography,          
 Environmental Studies, Art, Craft and 
 Needlework, Religious Education and   
 Physical Education.                   </content>
