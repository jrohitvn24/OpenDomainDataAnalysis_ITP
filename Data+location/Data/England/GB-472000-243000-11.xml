		<title>11The 'Old Mill'</title>
		<content>  Next to the church, by the side of   
 the brook,can be found the 'Old Mill'.
 In 1985 the building, which was in a  
 rather delapidated condition, was sold
 for re-development. It is presently   
 undergoing conversion into three      
 dwellings.                            
  The history of this fine building is 
 rather interesting.  It was originally
 built to replace a windmill which     
 stood near and was used to grind corn 
 and other cereals. A large dam was    
 formed across the brook and the water 
 held by the dam was used to drive the 
 water wheel. When the pond was full of
 water it could drive the wheel for    
 about 2 hours. A sound like continuous
 thunder could be heard when the mill  
 was in use. A steam engine was also   
 used to drive the mill. The mill was  
 used up until about 1951 and the pond 
 was filled in in 1954.                </content>
