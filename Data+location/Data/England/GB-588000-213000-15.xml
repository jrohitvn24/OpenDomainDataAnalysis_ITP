		<content> I looked into some local newspapers   
 for adverts on Tiptree. Tiptree's Jam 
 Factory which is famous world wide for
 its jam has had its secretary's idea  
 taken up. His idea was to have a stamp
 printed on the Jam Factory's          
 centenary.                            
 He helped to design the stamp with the
 fruit fields surrounding the factory. 
 Mr Dickson from Tiptree will have to  
 decorate his bedroom ceiling again    
 when his 160 model aeroplanes which   
 hang from it go to North Weald        
 Restoration museum. Mr Dickson started
 to collect and make the models when he
 came out of hospital. T.J.Evers LTD.  
 in New Road Tiptree has Bradstone     
 Paving, Fence Panels, Timber and      
 boards and a lot more. Tiptree's main 
 toy shop is D. Bassingham. It sells   
 toys, models and games. From Lego to  
 Action Men.                           </content>
