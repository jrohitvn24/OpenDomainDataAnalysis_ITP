		<title>06 Medley Sailing Club, Oxford</title>
		<content>   The club is for people of all ages  
who sail dingies (small sailing boats) 
as a pastime or a sport.The most       
common  dingies are Mirrors,Toppers    
and Enterprises.                       
   The club is situated by the river   
Isis with a quay and a ramp just in    
front.It has a boatshed and club       
house,both wooden constructions,and a  
fenced yard for keeping boats in.The   
club owns a safety launch.There is also
a shop inside which sells crisps and   
soft drinks,and a grassed area         
with climbing frame and swings.        
   Every Sunday,except in winter,there 
are races organised by an officer of   
the day(O.D.).                         
   When a friend gave me a Mirror,I    
joined as a junior member.Every        
weekend I go down and do up my         
boat:painting,sanding and varnishing.
