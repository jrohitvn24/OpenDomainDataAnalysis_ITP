		<title>12HIGH HURSTWOOD CHURCHES (1)</title>
		<content> In the centre of our block is Holy    
 Trinity, a thriving Anglican church   
 built in l870. The parish is currently
 served by a non-stipendiary priest-in-
 charge, a retired Air Vice Marshal,   
 who lives in the village. His con-    
 gregation includes people from        
 adjoining towns who, with those who   
 live in the parish make up an         
 electoral roll of 206. Average Sunday 
 attendance at 3 services is 122. Music
 is provided by an honorary organist   
 and choir of 8 adults and 4 children. 
 In the past 12 months there have been 
 11 baptisms, 7 marriages and 9        
 funerals. Junior Church meets in the  
 Village Hall, joining the adults once 
 a month. Two Churchwardens and a      
 Parochial Church Council of l4 assist 
 and advise on both spiritual and      
 material administration. This church  
 receives no outside financial help    </content>
