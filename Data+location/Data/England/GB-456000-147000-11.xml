		<content> The{Luncheon Club}meets at{East Oakley
{Village Hall}every Wednesday and has  
 been in operation for seven years. It 
 is run by volunteer help from the     
 village. Twenty{senior citizens}who   
 have been recommended by doctors or   
 welfare authorities, may attend. The  
 meals costing 80p. are provided by the
 Hampshire County Council Kitchens at  
 Winklebury. For these old people the  
 club provides social contact and a    
 focus for their week.

 in Basingstoke and taken round by
