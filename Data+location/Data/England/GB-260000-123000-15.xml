		<title>15ATTITUDES IN UMBERLEIGH</title>
		<content> What do people currently talk and     
 think about in Umberleigh? The weather
 is an important topic of conversation.
 Some times people dont want it to rain
 like farmers because they are making  
 hay and they can not take it to the   
 farm because it would be wet.         
 Neighbours often talk together about  
 rabbits that go on their gardens. They
 discuss putting nets over their       
 plants. The livestock market in       
 Barnstaple on Tuesday is discussed    
 regularly. Farmers take their sheep   
 and cows and sell them to other       
 farmers.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
