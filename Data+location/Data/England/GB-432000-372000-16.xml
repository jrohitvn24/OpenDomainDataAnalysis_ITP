		<content> The land between{Barlow Church}and    
{Dunston Hole Farm}is now restored to  
 fields after several years of         
{open-cast coal mining.It is again used
 for mixed crops and cattle. The{Sud   
{Brook}continues to flow from{West     
{to East}to join the{Barlow Brook      
 and then both join the{River Rother.  
 The farm at{Dunston Hole}has grown a  
{record crop}this last{year-1985-}and  
 many local farmers are being invited  
 to see how it was done.The most North 
 Easterly corner of our area is{King's 
{Wood}which is a{medieval}name and lies
 to the North of{Dunston Hole. }The    
 hill behind this is now run by the    
{Forestry Commission}and they have     
 planted the hillside with several     
 stands of{broad-leaved trees.}Usually,
{man-made forests}are planted with     
{quick growing softwoods.}The{B6051    
{road }runs from{North to South.       </content>
