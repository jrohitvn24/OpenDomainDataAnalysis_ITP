		<title>08THE GIANT OF SESSAY .1.</title>
		<content> The story is told because of its      
 connections with the Dawnay family,   
 notably Guy Dawnay whose father died  
 at Cowick in 1493.                    
 Sir John's son Guy, came courting Joan
 Darell, the heiress of Sessay. She    
 accepted his proposal of marriage on  
 one condition. This was that Sir Guy  
 should rid the district of a 'brute'  
 which was terrorising the district.   
 She described the creature as man     
 like, with legs as ponderous as an    
 elephant's, a single eye in the middle
 of his his forehead, and a mouth like 
 a lion's stuck with teeth as long as  
 the prongs on a hayfork. His clothing 
 was a cow's hide, and his weapon was a
 tree trunk. Whenever he pleased he    
 helped himself to the farm animals and
 the village women and children...all  
 of which he ate.
