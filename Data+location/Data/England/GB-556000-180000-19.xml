		<content> Wreckers struck at a school within    
 hours of the start of the summer      
 holiday at the weekend.               
    At Culverhouse School,South        
 Ockendon,a small casement window was  
 forced,and a fire started in a store  
 cupboard.Paper and cards in the       
 cupboard were destroyed,but the fire  
 was contained,though several rooms    
 were smoke damaged.                   
    A spokesman for Essex County       
 Council said this week"These          
 incidents,and there are more and more 
 every year,cost millions of pounds    
 that could be otherwise spent on more 
 valuable aspects of education.        
    "At a cost of Â£5O,OOO this year,we 
 are improving security in schools by  
 installing intruder alarms.
