		<title>08A FARM WORKER</title>
		<content> My dad is a farm worker and drives a  
 tractor every day.  Sometimes he      
 ploughs the fields.  The other day he 
 put a cover on the{fertilizer tank}in 
 the morning and cleaned straw out of  
 the{Dutch barns}in the afternoon.  In 
 summer he drives the{combine}harvester
 and is looking forward to having a new
 one, larger than the other two.       
 He goes to work at 7.00 a.m., comes in
 for breakfast at half past seven and  
 then works until 12.00.  He           
 has an hour for lunch and then        
 finishes at 4.30.  In the evening he  
 does some gardening and looks after   
 his{bees.} Then he watches T.V. and   
 goes to bed at 11.00.                 
 He is a{churchwarden}at St Nicholas'  
 Church.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
