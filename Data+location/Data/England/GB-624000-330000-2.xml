		<title>02ANTINGHAM CHURCHES/NEW ROAD</title>
		<content> It is possible to see about 6 churches
 from the north west corner of this    
 D-Block. However,the only one in the  
 block is at Antingham.The D-Block has 
 parts of 5 parishes so we asked the   
 children at our school whether they   
 went to church.We found that          
 31%did.Only one to Antingham.         
 Antingham has 2churches and we do not 
 really know the story behind it.We    
 have been told that it was because two
 sisters argued about the building of a
 church so they both started building. 
 Before they finished something is     
 supposed to have happened to one of   
 the sisters so one church was never   
 finished.Today the unfinished church  
 is covered in ivy and stands near the 
 new road which was opened in 1984     
 making the A149 much wider and safer  
 and away from Tavistock Farm.
