		<title>13SARRE HOMELIFE</title>
		<content> My dad works on a farm and drives     
 tractors and since I've been at Sarre 
 the Baxters Farm have got two new     
 tractors and my dad drives one and it 
 is a white one and my mum goes potato 
 picking.She might be going on the     
 calabrese which is a kind of          
 vegetable. I live in Sarre and they   
 are doing the houses up. We have a dog
 and her name is Pippa and I have a    
 brother and sister and they both go to
 Frank Montgomery School. I go to      
 Chislet Primary School. I do not think
 we should have houses built in Sarre. 
 At my school we go swimming and we go 
 at one o'clock and we are back at half
 past two. Where I live the number of  
 our house is three. We have lived in  
 Sarre for one and a half years but I  
 liked it where I lived before that was
 Hoath.
