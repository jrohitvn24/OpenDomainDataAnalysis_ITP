		<title>18THE STUD FARM M HARRIS</title>
		<content> The Combe Farm Stud was established 17
 years ago and now comprises 6         
 stallions, 15 brodmares and their     
 followers. The stud began with a      
 nucleus of thoroughbreds until        
 Arabians were introduced. Due to the  
 financial climate in England the      
 Arabians have taken priority.         
 One of the largest economic factors in
 running a stud farm is the high labour
 intensity of looking after the animals
 and ever increasing feed costs make   
 horse breeding in England a difficult 
 proposition. The only viable course is
 to breed top class stock from         
 internationally well known bloodlines 
 to fill an export market. since its   
 small beginnings the stud has achieved
 a level of success of National merit  
 including having bred the thoroughbred
 Newmarket record breaking filly and   
 Royal and National Arab show winners. </content>
