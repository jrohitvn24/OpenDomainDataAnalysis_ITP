		<title>02AIREDALE HOSPITAL: WARD 17</title>
		<content>{Ward 17}is a children's ward in       
 Airedale hospital.The patients sleep  
 in rooms with four beds in them and   
 beside each bed is a cupboard to put  
 clothes in and a bedside table with a 
 radio and a button to press if you    
 want the nurses.The dinners come on a 
 trolley and the patients can pick what
 they want off the trolley. There is   
 another trolley with medicines and    
 tablets on it which has locked doors  
 and the sister has the key.On one side
 of the ward there is a row of         
 cupboards which are used to keep      
 laundry and toys in them.There are no 
 fixed times for visitors in the       
 children's ward but if people do come 
 they have to come between 11am and    
 6.45pm.At the end of the ward there is
 a store room.{(written by Paul        
{Edmonson aged ten).}
