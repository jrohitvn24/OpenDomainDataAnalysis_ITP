		<title>10THE SADDLER AT DRAYCOTT</title>
		<content> WE WENT TO THE {SADDLERS}IN {DRAYCOTT}
 AND SAW A NEWSPAPER CUTTING ABOUT     
 COATS WHICH HE HAD MADE FOR BABY      
 ELEPHANTS AT LONGLEAT. WE SAW MANY    
 THINGS WHICH HE MAKES FROM LEATHER    
 WHICH COMES FROM A TANNERY IN         
 DEVON SUCH AS{SADDLES}AND{BRIDLES.}IT 
 TAKES ABOUT 25 HOURS TO MAKE A SADDLE.
 IT IS NOT ONLY LEATHER WORK FOR HORSES
 WHICH IS MADE BUT FANCY WORK FOR      
 CIRCUS ANIMALS USING COLOURED LEATHERS
 AND DIAMANTE. HE STITCHES BY HAND     
 USING THREAD RUBBED IN BEES WAX AND   
 ALSO MAKES PATTERNS WITH FANCY        
 STITCHING AND LEATHER THONGS. HE      
 REPAIRS ARICLES AS WELL AS MAKING NEW 
 ONES, HE IS VERY SKILFUL AND VERY     
 CLEVER AND IS A MEMBER OF THE {SOCIETY
{OF MASTER SADDLERS.} HIS WORKS GOES   
 ALL OVER THE WORLD FROM THE SMALL     
 WORKSHOP IN OUR VILLAGE.
