 connecting it to the outside world.   
 Depending upon ones needs this can be 
 either a blessing or a curse.         
 At one time the town was connected to 
{Wivenhoe}by way of a rail link but    
 this has long since been axed.As a    
 result the sole means of public       
 transport is the bus. A half hourly   
 service connects with{Colchester,}the 
 routes circling the town in alternate 
 directions each half hour.There is    
 also an infrequent service to{Clacton.
                                       
 The majority of commuters prefer to   
 use private rather than public        
 transportation, many vehicles being   
 shared.                               
 The advent of the traffic from        
 the port facility has placed quite a  
 strain on the single access system.
