		<content>   The A 47 is the main road running   
 through the area.  It links Norwich to
 Great Yarmouth and is a very busy     
 road.                                 
   Three types of traffic make it      
 particularly busy:                    
   1) Commuter Traffic.  Many people   
 use this road in their cars to go to  
 work in Norwich, making it busy in the
 morning and early evening.            
   2) Lorries going to the port of     
 Great Yarmouth.  This includes the    
 juggernauts  belonging to the Norfolk 
 Line and going to the Netherlands, and
 lorries carrying  goods for the       
 Natural Gas Rigs in the North Sea.    
   3) Holiday Traffic.  In the summer  
 the road is busy with cars, caravans  
 and coaches with people going to the  
 resorts on the Norfolk coast,         
 especially Great Yarmouth, and for    
 holidays on the Norfolk Broads.       </content>
