		<content> This area is very rural with fields   
 being predominantly pasture.Grain     
 crops are also important,the most     
 common being barley and winter        
 wheat.At Knightsbridge there are two  
 large nurseries one specialises in    
 flowers,the other in salad crops.     
   Settlement in the area is very      
 scattered,the 6 villags each contain  
 between 15-50 properties.There are two
 old churches,one at Boddington the    
 other at Elmstone Hardwicke that are  
 clearly the oldest buildings in the   
 area,although evidence of earlier     
 settlement can be seen from the ridge 
 and furrow marking near Elmstone.An   
 important feature in this area is the 
 M5 Motorway.There is a junction that  
 allows access and exit to and from the
 north.In contrast to this the River   
 Chelt and the canal are areas for     
 wildlife.                             </content>
