{The Downe Arms                        
  Built in 1725 as a farm house, the   
 Downe Arms was converted to an inn    
 when the road through Wykeham was     
 improved, it became a staging post    
 for the stagecoach traffic.First known
 as the Bull Inn, it took its present  
 name in 1872. The original building   
 has remained  virtually unaltered,    
 even through construction of the new  
 west wing . The Old Bar in this free  
 house is unchanged. Construction of an
 extention took place from 1975 to     
 1977.The architect was Sir Martyn     
 Beckett, who, has erected an elegant  
 stone building, its design inspired by
 an 18th century orangery.
