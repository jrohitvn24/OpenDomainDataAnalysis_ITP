		<content> We did a survey to ask our class about
 Cinderford and the surrounding areas. 
 Here are some of the answers.         
 Most people disliked the sheep roaming
 around because they eat all the plants
 and flowers.                          
 We were glad that Double View         
 Secondary School was changing to      
 Heywood Comprehensive.                
 If we could make any changes we       
 would alter the shops and build a     
 supermarket.                          
 Most of us wrote that we need a cinema
 for entertainment.                    
 We thought that the forest people     
 were nice and friendly.               
 We thought that in future Cinderford  
 will grow as large as Gloucester.
