		<content> We did a survey on how children in the
 second and third classes at Dunston   
 School get to school.19 walk,14 bike, 
 10 go in the car and 5 in the taxi.   
 Dunston School does not only have     
 children from Dunston in the second   
 and third classes,it has 4 people from
 Wasps Nest,4 from Potterhamworth,2    
 from Nocton and 5 who live down       
 Dunston Fen.                          
             An important aspect at    
 Dunston School is learning  cycling   
 proficiency.This is a test for people 
 nine and over to find out if they are 
 safe to ride their bikes on the road. 
 Most pupils leaving Dunston School go 
 to Branston Comprehensive.The school  
 bus arrives at Dunston at 8.30am and  
 leaves at 8.40am,it brings the pupils 
 back at 3.50pm.
