		<title>06The policeman in Lydden</title>
		<content>Lydden is policed by a rural policeman 
who is also responsible for Denton and 
Wootton.He works from his home at      
Temple Ewell but he is responsible to  
the Dover Police H.Q.The days of the   
village policeman who was resident and 
responsible for a single village have  
passed,due partly to cost and partly to
an improvement in communications which 
enables a single policeman to cover a  
wider area.The rural policeman works   
shifts and any emergencies during his  
off-duty time will be covered by a     
neighbouring rural policeman.He patrols
the village by car,motorbike and on    
foot and in addition to maintaining law
and order he is involved with all      
village activities,particularly at the 
local school.He attends sports days and
assists with projects,first aid and    
cycling proficiency.
