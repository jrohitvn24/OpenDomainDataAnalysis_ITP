      Riseley Drama Group was started  
 in l980 and consists mainly of        
 Riseley people.  Their productions    
 consist of a revue, 2 old time music  
 hall shows, a Pantomime, 3 one-act    
 plays, 2 full one-act plays and lastly
 a 3 act farce.  These productions were
 performed for 3 nights on the Village 
 Hall stage and were well received by  
 the audiences.  The group is largely  
 self-sufficient in that they make most
 of their costumes, or borrow from     
 other local groups, and have over the 
 years built up a very large wardrobe. 
 They also design and construct their  
 own sets.                             
      Rehearsals are held in the       
 Village Hall once of twice a week for 
 a production, and the group is funded 
 by the Village Hall Committee. All    
 profits go to the Village Hall.       </content>
