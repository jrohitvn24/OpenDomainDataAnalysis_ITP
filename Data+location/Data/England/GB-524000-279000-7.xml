		<title>07Lifestyles around Raveley</title>
		<content> The grid covers a rural area          
 containing 3 small villages, Little   
 Raveley and Great Raveley are farming 
 hamlets and social life centres around
 the farms.  Wistow has grown with new 
 housing developments in recent years  
 and residents commute to neighbouring 
 towns for employment and shopping.  It
 has a church and a public house and   
 some social life centres around these.
  There is also a post office cum      
 village store where everyday needs can
 be obtained.  Able village people care
 for their less able neighbours and    
 help with visits to doctors and       
 dentists.  Most mothers stay at home  
 with their children until they reach  
 school age.  There is no ethnic       
 population, although a few American   
 service personnel live in the area.
