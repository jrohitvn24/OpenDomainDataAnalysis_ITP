		<content> The clubs in Winterton are very       
 popular. There are over 20. Some of   
 the members have to wear uniforms and 
 badges. 16 of the clubs are for       
 younger people. Many activities go on 
 such as competitions, trips, raising  
 money for charities etc. In our       
 village there are; brownies, guides,  
 scouts, Womens' Institute, buffs,     
 bingo, woodcraft and many more. The   
 brownies were formed in 1910. They    
 have 24 members. A brownie's job is to
 help people. We sent a letter to all  
 the clubs in Winterton. 8 replied. The
 clubs mostly meet at pubs and schools 
 or sometimes they have their own      
 special place to meet. The buffs is a 
 club for adults who raise money for   
 charities. They started in 1950. The  
 mothers' club has the most members,   
 52. The guides have the smallest club,
 22. The React club is for CB listeners</content>
