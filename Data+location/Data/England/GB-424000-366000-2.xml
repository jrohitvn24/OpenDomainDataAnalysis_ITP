 AND ROUGH GRAZING . ONE OF THE PLACES 
 THAT I LIKED BEST WASTHE BIT WHERE WE 
 HAD OUR DINNER. IT WAS CALLED         
 CHATSWORTH PARK THERE WAS AN OLD      
 KNOCKED DOWN BUILDING THAT HAD GOT A  
 MILL WHEEL BESIDE IT. CHATSWORTH IS A 
 PLACE WHERE ANIMALS GRAZE AND THERE   
 WAS ALOT OF DEAD ANIMALS ON THE ROAD. 
 FIRST WE WENT THROUGH A WOOD WHERE    
 THERE WAS A ROAD GOING THROUGH IT.    
 ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY ROUND 
 THERE WAS A MOOR THAT WAS REALLY FLAT 
 ALL THE WAY THEN WE CAME TO A WOOD IT 
 WAS ALL DARK UNDER THE PINE TREES AND 
 THERE WERE PINE NEEDLES ON THE FLOOR  
 AND IT WAS REALLY SOFT TO TREAD ON.AT 
 THE TOP OF CHATSWORTH THERE WAS A WOOD
 WITH A HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. WE  
 GOT LOST AND A MAN CAME
