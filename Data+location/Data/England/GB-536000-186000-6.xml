		<title>06LIGHTHOUSE CHURCH</title>
		<content>{The Lighthouse Methodist Church }was  
 first built in 1893 but since then it 
 has been renovated to suit its present
 needs.A seafaring man called Captain  
 King built a church in the shape of a 
 lighthouse because he was associated  
 with the sea and wanted to guide      
 people to the Lord.                   
   The new design of the church means  
 that there is a place for people to   
 meet together for various activities  
 such as morning and evening           
 worship,Brownies,Guides,Cubs,Scouts   
 and Rangers.                          
   Around eighty people go there every 
 week to meet and make friends.        
   The Lighthouse has become one of the
 well known landmarks of Walthamstow.
