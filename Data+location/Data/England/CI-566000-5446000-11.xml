		<title>11Our Estate</title>
		<content>   The housing estate where I live is  
 called Le Squez Estate. The building  
 of the estate has changed the         
 landscape dramatically. When you look 
 around there are not as many trees as 
 there used to be. There were about    
 five or six fields because before the 
 estate was built it used to be a farm.
 Each field had a row of trees         
 surrounding it. The trees were        
 meant as a wind break so a double row 
 of trees was needed. All this has gone
 now but there are still a few trees   
 round this estate. Hopefully there    
 will be some new trees planted and we 
 shall have some more greenery around  
 the estate. So the estate was built on
 top of a farm.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
