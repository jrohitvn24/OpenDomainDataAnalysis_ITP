 IS A ILLSTRATING THE HALDON GRAVELS   
 OVER 65 MILLION YEARS OLD.THE LAST    
 LARGE FIRE WAS AT LITTLE HALDON.IT    
 COVERED A FEW ACRES.IT IS NOT YET     
 KNOWN HOW MANY ACRES THE GREAT FIRE   
 COVERED. THE MOST UANDALIZED THING    
 IN HALDON IS THE ADVETURE TRAIL.THE   
 SCOTCH PINE TIMBER IS USED FOR        
 POSTS,HUTSAND BULDINGS.THERE IS A     
 WOODEN CABIN THAT WAS BULIT IN 1978   
 AND TOOK THREE WEEKS TO BUILD.THERE   
 IS A  STONE FLOOR WHICH WAS MADE BY   
 ROCKS FROM THE QUARY.{HALDON TOWER    
  THE TOWER IS A VERY CLEAR LAND       
 MARK.IT STANDS  OUT VERY WELL.TWO     
 PEOPLE LIVE IN IT ARE THE DALE        
 BROTHERS.IT IS A VERY GOOD PLACE FOR A
 PICNIC ON A HOT DAY,BUT IT SEEMS TO BE
 OPEN WHEN IT RAINS{OR}ITS MISTY.YOU   
 CAN SEE IT WHEN YOU ARE LOST.         </content>
