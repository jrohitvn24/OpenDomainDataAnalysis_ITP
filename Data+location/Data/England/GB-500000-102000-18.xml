		<title>18A Day at Littlehampton Fair</title>
		<content> On Saturday 13 July Iwent to the fair 
 at Southfields Recreation Ground.It   
 was 7.30 in the evening and the noise 
 of the fair ground could be heard a   
 long way away.The fair was small in   
 comparison to some I have been to but 
 nevertheless very exciting. There is  
 always a certain mystery associated   
 with travelling fairs and this one was
 no different.                         
 There were many rides including such  
 names as the space walk, and rocker   
 plane and more traditional ones such  
 as the infamous "Dodgems".            
 I spent a great deal of time just     
 wandering around looking at the       
 sideshows and at the peoples happy    
 faces as they went for yet another    
 ride on the waltser.                  
 It was a very enjoyable evening .     
                                       
                                       </content>
