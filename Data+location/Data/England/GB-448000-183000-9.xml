		<content>///////////////////////////////////////
  The building of the new village hall 
was started in 1982 and was completed  
by 1983.The old village hall,which had 
been in existence since 1920 was       
pulled down in 1980. Mrs.Clarke of     
Blewbury, District Councillor for the  
area,got a grant of 30,000 pounds from 
the County Council and without this    
Chilton would  not have had a new      
hall. The builders were Campbells of   
Wantage, and the concrete and wooden   
building was designed by architect     
Alan Turner. Parking is available at   
the hall,and it is used for Women's    
Institute meetings, dancing classes,   
discos, meetings, keep-fit sessions,   
wedding receptions, etc.Hiring the     
hall costs about 1 pound 50 pence per  
hour for local people and 2 to 3       
pounds an hour for outside users.
