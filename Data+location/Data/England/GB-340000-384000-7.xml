		<title>07A Saturday In Garston</title>
		<content>   I got up and watched{television}at  
 7.13 a.m. at my Nan's house. I got fed
 up: I wished there were more cartoons 
 on the B.B.C. My Nan came down and    
 made{breakfast of crumpets}and toast. 
 I read a book called 'More Crazy' then
 I got dressed. Later I went home with 
 my Dad and drew Robin Hood escaping   
 from Nottingham Castle. At 1.35 p.m. I
 had{dinner of meatballs}and chips.    
 After dinner I finished drawing. Then 
 my Dad, sister and I walked to the    
 village to buy something to fix my    
 Dad's bike, and a battery for his     
 watch. At 4.00 p.m. I went to the     
 field on my bike. When I returned, my 
 Mum was back from work. I drew a Space
 Base. At 5.24 p.m. we had tea and     
 watched television. I went out to play
 then returned to my{Nan's to sleep}at 
 8.45 p.m. I went to bed at 10.17 p.m.
