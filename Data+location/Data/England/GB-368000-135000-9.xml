		<content> The third and last farmer we          
 interviewed also works very long      
 hours.He enjoys his work but not      
 sometimes in the winter when it is    
 wet and cold.His farm is 450 acres and
 is purely dairy.                      
           When asked about changes in 
 farming in the last twenty years he   
 said it is now much more              
 mechanised,therefore fewer workers are
 required.Farming has become more      
 intensive with a greater number of    
 animals per acre.Most farms have      
 changed to silage for feed in winter  
 instead of hay as it is easier to     
 make.                                 
      Agricultural fertilisers are     
 considered to be very important       
 because of the intensive nature of    
 modern farming.
