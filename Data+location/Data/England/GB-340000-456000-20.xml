		<content>KATY YOUNGÂ£S WEEK                      
Every day I get up at 7.15 to go to    
school.We do lessons till play-time,   
and play Â£tigÂ£orÂ£stick-in-the-mudÂ£.    
After dinner we do lessons again,then  
we say prayers,and go home.            
On Saturday,thereÂ£s no school,so I get 
up at 8.30 to watchÂ£Wide-AwakeÂ£.After  
breakfast,we go shopping.We have fish  
and chips for dinner,if the tide is not
right.Then I have my piano lesson,and  
my sister has her riding lesson.       
On Sunday,we sometimes go out for the  
whole day,or we go to church in the    
morning,and play out for the rest of   
the day.We get our school stuff ready  
after tea,and have to go to bed early, 
so we can get up for school in the     
morning.
