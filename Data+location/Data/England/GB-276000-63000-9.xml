		<title>09The Hedgerows nr. Staverton</title>
		<content> The farmers are trying to             
 keep the ancient banks and hedges that
 separate the fields,but we have       
 noticed the area around Abham has been
 turned into four large{fields}where   
 some ten were before.This issue has   
 been discussed by the parish council  
 and the owner maintains that changing 
 from mixed farming to cereal growing  
 means that room must be made for      
 machines to operate efficiently.      
      We hope this won't affect too    
 much of the countryside as so many    
 creatures that we are learning about  
 live in the hedges.We have also found 
 from our Hooper's hedge study that    
 many are more than 500 years old.     
      All of us recorded the           
{flowers}of the{hedgerow}that we could 
 find and could not believe there were 
 206 different species.
