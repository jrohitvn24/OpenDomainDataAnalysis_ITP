		<content>     There are still a number of       
 traditional cottages in and around the
 village. These have cob walls with    
 thatched roofs. In some cases cottages
 have been combined to make a larger   
 dwelling, extensions have been added  
 and some have been converted into     
 detached garages. There are a few cob 
 cottages where the thatch was replaced
 by slate during the nineteenth        
 century. There are a few houses from  
 the period between the wars and these 
 are all brick and tile. There has been
 a lot of building during the last     
 thirty years, mostly bungalows.       
     There is a small estate of council
 houses and other council houses are   
 spread around the village.            
     Many farm workers cottages have   
 been sold or are occupied by tenants  
 who are not agricultural workers.
