		<title>19THE OPENING OF THE BY_PASS</title>
		<content>   Some people have not welcomed the   
 opening of the Hatch Beauchamp        
 by_pass.One garage has closed down    
 because of a reduction in trade and   
 one shop has also closed.             
   But most of the people who live by  
 the once congested A358,are in favour 
 of the new by_pass. Now, Hatch        
 Beauchamp is quieter and the risk of  
 accidents caused by heavy traffic has 
 been reduced considerably. As the     
 village is quieter more people may    
 come to live here and perhaps we shall
 have improved facilities as a result. 
 Already a house is being built on the 
 site of the garage and there are plans
 to build fifty new houses. In general,
 most of the people in Hatch Beauchamp 
 think that the opening of the new road
 has improved the village and the      
 quality of village life.
