		<content> Involvement in local clubs and        
 societies is strong - sports clubs,   
 social clubs run by political         
 organisations, athletic clubs, local  
 parent/teacher associations, amateur  
 dramatics, Round Table, British Legion
 and church youth groups.  There is    
 also a local Canal Society.           
 There is a thriving Girl Guide and Boy
 Scout Association in the area.  Most  
 popular are the Brownie and Cub       
 sections, which cater for children    
 between the ages of 7 and 10.         
 Actvities organised for the children  
 include venture walks and outdoor     
 games.  Achievement badges can be won 
 and are shown on a special uniform.   
 In this area lies Linnet Clough County
 Scout Camp, which is used by Scouts   
 and Guides from all over the Country  
 as well as Manchester school children 
 as a base for field studies.          </content>
