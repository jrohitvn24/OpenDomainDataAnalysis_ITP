		<content> We had a visit to Mr.Sandercock's farm
 and he said he grew grass and corn,   
 mainly barley.He has sixty acres to   
 grow crops and keep his animals.He has
 20 cows and 20 calves.Two of the cows 
 are Guernseys,two are Jerseys and the 
 rest are Friesians.There were too many
 males so he had to sell them to the   
 market.Mr.Sandercock goes to the {    
{Royal Cornwall Show}most years.Each   
 day he gets up at 6-30a.m.He has 2 and
 a half tractors and one combine       
 harvester.The half of a tractor is    
 used for parts.We went into one of the
 fields and the friendliest cow,which  
 is a Jersey,came up to us.We were able
 to stoke her.We went to a field to see
 this year's corn crop.We could see our
 school from the hill.It was a very    
 nice afternoon.
