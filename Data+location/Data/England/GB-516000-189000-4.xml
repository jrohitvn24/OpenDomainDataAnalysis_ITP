		<title>04TWO SENIOR CITIZENS</title>
		<content> SENIOR CITIZEN 1 has lived in Stanmore
 for 35 years. She intends to retire to
 Ipswich. Although she likes the area  
 she thinks it too noisy. She is also  
 worried that the streets are unsafe   
 and inadequate for traffic. She would 
 like to see a supermarket nearby to   
 improve the shopping.                 
                                       
 SENIOR CITIZEN 2 has lived in Stanmore
 for 21 years. She likes its village   
 atmosphere. She thinks the only       
 amenity lacking is a library. She     
 worries about overcrowding and the    
 amount of building. She also feels    
 public transport is inadequate. Her   
 final words were that she would like  
 to "combat the building".{            
{                                      
 BOTH of them would like to see a      
 shopping centre for pensioners and    
 more entertainment for young people.  </content>
