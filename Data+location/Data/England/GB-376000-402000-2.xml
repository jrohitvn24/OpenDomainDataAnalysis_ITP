		<content>    {St. Augustines}school is built    
 beside the church. The school is a    
 mixture of infants and juniors and a  
 nursery class. The old school and the 
 church were built in 1873. The school 
 we are in now was built in 1937.      
 everybody brought a penny to school to
 pay for a brick.All the children and  
 teachers go into church for services  
 sometimes. It is getting a new roof   
 now because the old one was rotten.   
 There is a{Kestrel}nesting on the     
 church, behind a statue of a saint.   
 The church is famous because it was   
 designed by a famous architect called 
{George Frederick Bodley.}People come  
 from all over the world to look at it.
 There was another famous building     
 called the{Acme mill}next to the      
 school.An artist called{L.S.Lowry}used
 to paint it but it was demolished two 
 years ago.                            </content>
