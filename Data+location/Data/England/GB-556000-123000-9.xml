		<title>09A HOUSE IN EAST SUSSEX</title>
		<content> THE HOUSE IS SET IN A RAMBLING GARDEN 
 SURROUNDED BY WOODS. IT IS BUILT IN   
 TWO PARTS, THE ORIGINAL DATING BACK TO
 1726. THE OUTER WHITE BRICK CONCEALS  
 WATTLE AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE        
 ORIGINAL BEAMS WHICH ARE REPUTED TO BE
 OF THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE WOOD USED 
 IN DRAKE'S NAVY. THEIR GUNS WERE BUILT
 WITH IRON TAKEN FROM MINES IN THE     
 HEATHFIELD AREA AND WERE TESTED AT    
 HORAM. THE EARLY WALL PAPER WAS HAND  
 PAINTED IN PATTERNS OF BIRDS, FLOWERS 
 OR ANIMALS. THE WATER SUPPLY IS TAKEN 
 FROM STREAMS OR WELLS AND IT IS       
 PURIFIED WITH CHLORINE. THE OCCCUPANTS
 DISPLAY AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN ALL
 FORMS OF NATURAL HISTORY. SOMETIMES   
 WILD ANIMALS BECOME TAME IN THEIR     
 GROUNDS. THEY APPRECIATE THINGS OF THE
 PAST ESPECIALLY OLD BUILDINGS AND     
 FURNITURE REPRESENTATIVE OF PEOPLES'  
 WAY OF LIFE.                          </content>
