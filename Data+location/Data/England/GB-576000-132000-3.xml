		<title>03BENENDEN WEALD, LANDSCAPE.</title>
		<content> This small portion of the High Weald  
 of Kent is a hilly one lying along the
 watershed of the Medway and the       
 Rother. It rises to over 300feet (120 
 metres) along this line which is      
 followed by the Swattenden Road, (B   
 2086).  This higher area is better    
 drained and mainly cultivated. Even so
 deciduous woodland with the various   
 varieties of oak predominating is a   
 marked feature of the landscape, with 
 trees and small shaws forming wide    
 green hedges between the fields, so   
 that even  farmed land takes on the   
 guise of woodland. We had great       
 difficulty in finding wide views to   
 assess the land-cover of our grid     
 squares. Here the idea of dens as     
 clearings in the forest is well seen  
 on a map or from the air, and the     
 landscape of Adreasweald or Domesday  
 Book is still a reality.              </content>
