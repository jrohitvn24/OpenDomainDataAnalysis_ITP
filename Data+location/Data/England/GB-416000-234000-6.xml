		<content> The policeman in Blockley.He wanted to
 be a policeman because he wanted to   
 help and be part of a community.The   
 qualities to be a policeman are to be 
 helpful patient and a good listener.  
 He doesn't work at a set time but he  
 is his own boss.You don't have to have
 qualifications  to join the           
 police force  although Mr.Butcher     
 did.And he  still takes exams as a    
 policeman now.

 and is on Greenway Road.
