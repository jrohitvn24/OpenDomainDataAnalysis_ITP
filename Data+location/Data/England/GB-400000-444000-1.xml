 The D block consists of a large amount
 of flat land. This is because it is in
 the valley bottom.Through the centre  
 of the D block runs the River Aire and
 the Leeds to Liverpool Canal. Around  
 Kildwick and Farnhill there is a lot  
 of farmland which is used for cattle  
 farming.The main shopping centre is   
 Crosshills. This is convenient because
 it is in the middle of the other      
 villages.The main road also runs in   
 the middle of the D block following   
 the river and canal.Most of the people
 who live in the D block are           
 commuters,commuting to the cities.This
 is because most of the old industries 
 have declined.In recent years the     
 population of these villages has      
 increased so more houses have had to  
 be built.                             </content>
