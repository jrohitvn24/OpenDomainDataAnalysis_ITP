		<content> There are about{150 caravans}on the   
 site at Plucks Gutter. Their owners   
 come down at weekends and for holidays
 and are joined by{'tent campers'}in   
 the summer. During the warm months a  
 kind of village community appears,    
 whose local point is the Dog and Duck.
 The 'Caravaners' have little contact  
 with Stourmouth as their is no shop or
 post office. They drive to Canterbury 
 on Thanet for all their needs. It is a
 happy community, likened to the{East  
{End of London.}Everyone knows and     
 helps their neighbours, and there are 
 some wonderful 'characters'. On       
 retirement some Caravaners buy houses 
{in the village,}but often regret doing
 so. They say they find no friendly    
 atmosphere since few of the old       
 farming population remain. The        
 'weekenders have come here to get away
 from people anyway.                   </content>
