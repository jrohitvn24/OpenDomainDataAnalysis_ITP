		<content> After William the Conqueror had become
 King of England he set about making   
 the first{Domesday Book.}In our area  
 there are three places that are       
 mentioned in the Cheshire section of  
 the original {Domesday Book}.They are 
 Aston Juxta Mondrum,Poole and         
 Worleston. These places were          
 originally manors where people lived  
 and worked on the land.They were very 
 small places and very few people lived
 there. There may have been about 100  
 people altogether, because 800 years  
 ago Cheshire was a very wild and      
 lonely place that was covered with    
 forests and waste land.There were very
 few people living in the County and   
 those that did lived near Chester or  
 up on the Wirral.                     
 Nowadays, Cheshire is a very crowded  
 County and in our area alone there are
 nearly 100,000 people.                </content>
