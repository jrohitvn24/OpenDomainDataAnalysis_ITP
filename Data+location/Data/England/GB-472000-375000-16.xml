		<content> The land in this area is vary good for
 arable farming. This is because it is 
 mainly flat and has been derived from 
 river alluvium and sedementary bed    
 rock. Machinery has little trouble    
 from wet land or steep slopes.        
  The streams coming from the villages 
 all drain into the River Trent. This  
 then flows into the Humber and into   
 the North Sea.                        
  Very little erosion takes place. In  
 fact the only erosion is that of      
 the wind blowing loose surface soils  
 off the fields, but this does not     
 create any problem.                   
  The old villages each had a woodland 
 area. This is why small stands of     
 trees can be seen as well as the      
 established woods of Gamston and      
 Eaton. These all act as a haven for   
 wildlife and game birds.
