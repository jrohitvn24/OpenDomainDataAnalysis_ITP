		<title>15COLBRED SHEEP -ABLINGTON</title>
		<content> The large, white-faced sheep which    
 graze on land belonging to Crickley   
 Barrow Farm are the result of a       
 careful, scientific breeding programme
 which started in the 1950's. The aim  
 was to produce a type of sheep chiefly
 designed for the meat trade, the      
 carcass being leaner and heavier in   
 comparison with many pedigree sheep.  
 The Colbreds are docile and           
 particularly trouble-free at lambing  
 time. Recently they have been used for
 the production of milk which is sold  
 in England on a commercial basis. The 
 sheep are now being exported to Italy 
 and Ireland, and their commercial     
 qualities are increasingly being      
 recognized in all parts of Great      
 Britain.
