		<content>{Court Lodge Farm}is a 680 acre strip  
 of land running up one side of the    
{Darent Valley. }The valley bottom is  
 fertile gravel soil, but as the ground
 slopes up above the 100 feet contour  
 this is replaced by light flinty soil 
 only about 6" thick above the solid   
 chalk.                                
    The farm grows wheat, barley,      
 oats, peas, oil seed rape, potatoes,  
 maize, grass, lucerne, kale and hops. 
 Cattle are bought in the autumn and   
 fattened on home-grown produce.  In   
 late spring the bullocks are sold for 
 beef at 16-20 months old.             
    The farm has a flock of about 400  
 breeding ewes of the Masham and Mule  
 breeds. The lambs are fed on grass    
 leys and on kale.  They are sold fat  
 at 3 -10 months old.                  
    The farm employs eight men and     
 about 12 part-time women and students.</content>
