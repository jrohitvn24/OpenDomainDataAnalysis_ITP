		<content>                                       
  The Fox is the only public house in  
the area under review and is a good    
example of a typical English country   
pub. One of the features of our age is 
the changing character of local pubs.  
Darts are still played as are dominoes 
and crib but pool tables are now a     
common feature so are electronic games 
and duke boxes which provide LOUD      
music, not enjoyed by all|   Food,     
particularly basket snack meals are    
widespread and many, including the Fox,
provide more formal meals of a very    
high standard. Typical prices in 1985:-
   Pint of bitter beer  ...... 78p     
   Tot of spirits ............ 68p     
   Glass of wine ............. 60p     
   Fruit juices ...............30p     
Ploughman's lunch 1.50: Sandwiches 70p 
Scampi &amp; chips 2 pounds:Sausage        
                        &amp; chips 1.50   </content>
