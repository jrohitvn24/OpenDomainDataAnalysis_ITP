		<title>04Down By The River Avon.</title>
		<content>    Most of the housing by the{River   
{Avon}in the{Milston}area was thatched.
 We studied a good example of this     
 style.The thatch had a covering of    
 chicken wire and the walls of the     
 house were made of flint and brick.   
    Near the house a narrow path winds 
 away to reveal the{landscape}by the   
 River Avon to be mainly tree and      
 flower.                               
    On the sides of the path there were
 a great many Jack-O-The-Pulpit.Down   
 the same path we saw a strange tree   
 that had fungi growth all over it.    
    At Milston the River Avon was about
 20 metres wide.In the fields nearby   
 the majority of the{trees}were        
 Horse-Chestnut.Others included        
 Sycamore,Oak and Beech.
