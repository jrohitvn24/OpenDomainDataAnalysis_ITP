		<title>13The Railway of Endon (3).</title>
		<content>    When steam trains were operational,
the railway plate layers cut the grass 
at the sides of the track because of   
the fire risk from flying sparks.The   
grass was given to the railway horses. 
    In 1921 there was a cloudburst in  
the area  and the level of water in    
Stanley Pool rose so much that it      
overflowed.A bridge was badly damaged  
and railway lines were ripped up       
causing a passenger train derailment.  
    In 1970 the booking hall was taken 
down and on the site,a newsagents now  
stands.The signalbox was demolished in 
1974 and the level crossing over the   
Endon to Stanley road was converted to 
a more modern open type crossing       
controlled by lights and operated by   
the train crews when required.         
    Now all that remains of the railway
era in Endon is a mineral line.
