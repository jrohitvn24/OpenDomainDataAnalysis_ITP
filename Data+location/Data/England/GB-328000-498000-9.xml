		<content>    Cumbrians are renowned for their   
 interest in all forms of sport, and   
 this area is no exception. The        
 tradition of{fell-running}is carried  
 on with annual races taking place on  
 the adjoining Coniston Fells.  Even   
 the local secondary school has its own
 fell-race.                            
    Field sports, in the form of       
{fox-hunting}with foot-followers (too  
 rugged for horses) are an accepted    
 and important part of the local scene,
 since the fox population has to be    
 controlled.{Fishing}for trout in the  
 becks,{shooting}and{deer-stalking}are 
 also to be found, but on a smaller    
 scale. In nearby Coniston, the        
 traditional sports of{cricket}and     
{football}are very strongly represented
 with{sailing}on Coniston Water as a   
 further attraction.
