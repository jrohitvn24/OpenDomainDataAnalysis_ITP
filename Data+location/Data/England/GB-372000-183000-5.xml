		<title>05Housing in the Horton Area.</title>
		<content> The main housing is farmhouses but new
 expensive houses are being built for  
 the rich.There are some very old      
 houses.There is one which was built in
 the 1400's.There is a housing estate  
 in the area to the southwest of our   
 square.This is some of the new housing
 estate of north Yate.The design of the
 houses are similar to many of the     
 other houses in Yate.The older houses 
 are more traditional to the area but  
 the new houses with new designs make  
 the older houses odd and out of place.
 The new people make life for farmers  
 very diffcult because they do not     
 respect the land.The new houses are   
 priced at an average of about Â£50,000 
 but some new executive houses may cost
 Â£130,000.At Yate Rocks there is a     
 small community of older houses which 
 have been there for about a hundred   
 years,built around the Ford.          </content>
