		<title>02Cropwell Bishop Quarries</title>
		<content>{Gypsum }has been mined and quarried in
 Cropwell Bishop since about 1900.All  
 land from Pasture Lane to Kinoulton   
 Road and towards Nottingham Road was  
 mined originally but No:1 Quarry was  
 opened in 1948 by{Pipewell Ploughing  
{Company,}who worked it until 1953 when
 the{Gotham Company}put in its own     
 draglines.Water from mines and        
 quarries was pumped through dykes to  
 enter the River Smite at Colston      
 Bassett. The quarry was closed in 1958
 due to the closenes of the            
 mineworkings, with a danger of{       
 flooding. The quarry had an average   
 depth of 50feet.The main use of the{  
 gypsum was for plaster of paris,      
 surgical use, etc. The land is now    
 used for cereal crops, in rotation    
 with root crops, having been restored 
 to agricultural use in 1959.
