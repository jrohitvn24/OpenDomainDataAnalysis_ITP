		<content>   Ossett town centre is not a very    
 good place to find animals but you    
 will find a lot of                    
 insects,e.g.ants,woodlice,beetles etc.
   A good place to find wild animals is
 the railway banking.In addition to the
 normal garden birds you will see      
 Kestrels.The banking also has a lot of
 flowers.There are mammals such as     
 rabbits,mice,voles,hares and sometimes
 foxes.You can find many of these      
 animals on Storrs Hill Rocks.         
   There are a lot of footpaths around 
 the banking and surrounding           
 fields,young trees have been planted  
 to encourage wildlife and improve the 
 area.                                 
   There is a fishing area called      
 Healey Dam in which you find          
 bream,pike,freshwater trout and       
 stickleback.
