		<content> Both Walkern &amp; Ardeley have ancient   
 churches: St Mary's &amp; St Lawrence both
 founded in Saxon times, with Saxon    
 remains in the former. They attract   
 good congregations (40-60) with many  
 more on special occasions &amp; are       
 generally well regarded by non-church 
 goers who see them as focal points of 
 village life &amp; who value the          
 historical continuity &amp; stability     
 which they represent. Walkern has a   
 good &amp; keen choir &amp; both churches have
 a strong bell-ringing tradition. The  
 tenor bell at St Lawrence was rung to 
 celebrate the victory at Agincourt. A 
 Roman Catholic chapel in Walkern has  
 recently closed. There is an active   
 'free-church' which has bplayed a part
 in village life for several hundred   
 years. Though community is largely    
 secular &amp; church goers in a minority, 
 religious life is still important.    </content>
