 churches - Anglican and Baptist - a   
 post office and three village stores, 
 an R.C. teaching convent and a        
 residential hospital school for       
 epilectic children, the biggest in    
 Europe. There are also recently built 
 private houses and two local authority

 population of around 1750 is a good
