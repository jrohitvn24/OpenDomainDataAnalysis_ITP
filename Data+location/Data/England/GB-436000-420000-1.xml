		<content> A permanent settlement has been       
 present since Saxon times(POST A.D.   
 400) at Normanton.The remains of an   
 ancient Saxon protective wall exist   
 near the libary in Haw hill park.     
 It is thought the name Normanton      
 is derived from a Norwegian           
 settlement.The word "tun" signifies   
 on enclosure of the Northmen whilst   
 the prefix"Norman" could be widely    
 interpreted to mean Northmen.Altofts  
 lies one mile North West of Normanton.
 The name Altofts helps support this   
 theroy as the word "Toft" means a     
 Scandanavian Encolsure.               
 The river Calder meanders North then  
 Eastwards along its flood plain whilst
 Normanton is situated South and East  
 of the river which was called the     
 Keldre (rapid water)in 1052.          
 Normontunne is mentioned in the       
 Domesday book of 1086.                </content>
