		<title>01OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Our area has three villages,Kirkburton
 which has most shops, Highburton which
 is mostly residential, and the small  
 village of Farnley. Many people travel
 to work in nearby towns like Leeds,   
 Huddersfield and Sheffield. We like to
 look after our villages and gardening 
 is a very popular hobby. In Farnley   
 all the houses have gardens and most  
 people do some gardening at least once
 a week. They like to have flowers and 
 lawns best, but a quarter of them also
 grow their own vegetables.            
   There are many other things to do   
 in our area. You can go horse riding, 
 join the village cricket team or even 
 go bowling. At Farnley there is a     
 bowling green and you can take        
 sandwiches and sit on the terrace to  
 watch.                                
   Really we are very lucky to live in 
 such a beautiful part of Yorkshire.   </content>
