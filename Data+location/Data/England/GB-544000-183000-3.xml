		<title>03BARKING ABBEY &amp;THE CHURCH</title>
		<content>     The abbey is in ruins because it  
 was demolished in 1539 by King Henry  
 VIII. This summer people have been    
 excavating there before the ruins are 
 built upon. The foundations can still 
 be seen. It was one of the main abbies
 in England, and a local secondary     
 school is named after it. {William the
{Conqueror}stayed there while the Tower
 of London was being built. Next to the
 ruins stands {St. Margaret's Church}  
 which was the medieval parish church. 
 This building dates from the 1700s.   
 The people of Barking used the church 
 while the nuns prayed in the abbey    
 itself. The explorer,{Captain James   
{Cook,}was married in the church on    
 21st of December, 1762.
