		<title>16BUNNY AND BRADMORE CHARITIES</title>
		<content> The Bunny and Bradmore Charities were 
 set up when Lady Anne Parkyns died in 
 1711. Her son Sir Thomas Parkyns built
 the Armshouses and the old Bunny      
 school in 1700. The Charities provided
 money each year for the school and    
 apprentices in Bunny, Bradmore and    
 Costock. For a salary of Â£10 a year   
 the headmaster taught the three "R's" 
 and the Catechism. Before Christmas a 
 Love_feast of cakes and ale was held. 
 Children started school at 5 unless   
 they could read. The schoolmaster     
 lived on the first floor of the Arms- 
 houses. The Armshouses included four  
 rooms for four poor widows who got a  
 new petticoat and gown every year at  
 the love_feast. By 1908 the Charities 
 gave Â£47 to apprentices living in     
 Bunny, Bradmore and Costock. Today    
 the Charities provide money for books 
 and equipment for use in the school.  </content>
