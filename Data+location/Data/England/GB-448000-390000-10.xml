		<content>  On{Friday}when I got home I fed the  
 ducks with bread, lettuce, mixed corn 
 and mash.Then I played at schools.    
 Hannah came at 4.45. She pretended to 
 be the teacher and I got a smack for  
 talking in lessons. At{6.00}I had{tea.
 I had tomato soup, horseshoe surprise,
 chips and a cup of coffee. After that 
 I watched T.V. After that I went round
 to see my Grandad. I had a cup of tea 
 and a biscuit.We got back at{9.45 pm  
 and I went to bed.                    
  On{Saturday}morning I got up at{10.30
 and went to town with Kerry to buy new
 shorts.At{1.30pm}we had sausages and  
 mashed potatoes for dinner. After my  
 dinner I phoned Jennifer to see if her
 Mum would bring her around in the car.
  Later we went to the shop to buy some
 stamps for some letters I had to post.
 We thought Jennifer had lost one of   
 the letters _ I nearly murdered her!  </content>
