		<content> The B.M.X. track is next to our school
 with the school fence separating them.
{It was built in 1984 and attracts     
{competitors from all over the North of
{England}to race meetings,which are    
 held every Tuesday and fortnightly on 
 a Sunday during the racing season.    
 On arrival competitors have to        
 register and have their bike checked  
 for safety.{All racers must wear      
{protective clothing.}Racing is done in
 age groups and when competitors are   
 called they must go to the top of the 
 start hill.Races are started with the 
 words,"Riders ready.Pedals ready.Go!" 
 The gate drops and the race begins.   
 Track Marshalls stand on each corner  
 and hold up a green flag for a clear  
 track and a red flag if an accident   
 occurs.When all the races have been   
 completed there is a trophy           
 presentation to race winners.         </content>
