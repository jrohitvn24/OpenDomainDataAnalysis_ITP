		<title>09The Bell Ringers, Stoulton</title>
		<content>   A married couple who have lived in  
 Stoulton for forty years are          
 companologists. They provided some    
 interesting information about the     
 bells in their house.                 
   At the end of their house, there is 
 an extension to provide a bell tower. 
 He became interested in bells in 1936 
 when he first started ringing church  
 bells. Then he was given two bells by 
 a friend which developed his interest.
 Today, he owns ten small bells which  
 were originally part of a carillon in 
 Australia. His bells are usually used 
 for a practice on Friday night by     
 local people. They are also used for  
 peals and family occasions, such as   
 birthdays. He is fortunate enough to  
 have his own foundry in the garden    
 where he makes his own bells. Visitors
 have come from Australia and New      
 Zealand to see his bells.             </content>
