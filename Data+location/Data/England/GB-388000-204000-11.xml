		<content> In the play-ground I play elastic. You
 need a piece of elastic and three     
 people.  You put the elastic around   
 their ankles. The third person has to 
 jump over and into the spaces without 
 touching the elastic.  Stage two is   
 jumping onto the elastic.  The third  
 step is to put your feet under the    
 elastic and jump over the second      
 piece taking the first piece over it  
 with your feet.  Having crossed the   
 elastic you step back separating the  
 elastic, jump up and on to the first  
 piece.  Having successfully completed 
 all the steps it is the turn of       
 another child. British Bulldog is a   
 game of chase in which there are two  
 safe places to stand.  Two people are 
 on it.  If they tag someone and say"  
 British Bulldog", the tagged person is
 also on it.  The game continues until 
 everyone is caught.                   </content>
