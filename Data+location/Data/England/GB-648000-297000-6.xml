The village store in Lound is also the 
Post Office. It is owned by Mr. Searby 
who has run it for eleven years. It    
sells many different things such as    
meat, bread, milk, fruit, vegetables,  
canned goods, icecreams, sweets,       
crisps, bottled drinks, tobacco,       
cigarettes, newspapers, comics,        
magazines, cards and wrapping paper.   
Outside the shop is a post box and a   
telephone box. There is also a notice  
-board which is well used by village   
people. Mr. Searby gets most of his    
goods from Nurden and Peacock in       
Oulton Broad and from a wholesaler in  
Great Yarmouth. He thinks his prices   
are reasonable for a village store.
