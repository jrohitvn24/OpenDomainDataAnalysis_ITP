		<content>  On Thursday 11th July we went to     
Hodgemoor Woods which is owned by the  
Forestry Commission with 31 byelaws    
made in 1982.There are horse tracks    
marked with a horseshoe and footpaths  
marked with a white arrow or circle.   
There are lots of different trees;oaks 
with acorns and sycamores with seeds   
called helicopters.There are elders    
and when the berries are ripe,you can  
make elderberry wine.There are silver  
birches,holly,rowans,hazels which have 
nuts in the winter and larches which   
have cones.The conifers are evergreen  
except for the larch which is          
deciduous. There is a small plantation 
of beech trees and the trees are about 
3 metres apart.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
