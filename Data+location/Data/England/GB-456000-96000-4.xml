		<content>      Our 'D' block serves quite       
 different housing needs.              
      On the western side, near the    
 Browndown Training Camp there are two 
 caravan parks.Each of the parks are   
 maintained by Gosport Borough         
 Council and serve as both a permanent 
 home and a seasonal base for both     
 residents and holidaymakers.          
      Behind the Stanley Park caravan  
 parks and the Stanley Recreation park 
 is a large residential area. There are
 many large detached houses built in   
 the early part of the century and     
 there is more modern development where
 people have sold off their extensive  
 gardens.                              
       The old Alvercliff house is now 
 a retirement and rest home for former 
 Royal Navy personnel and is an        
 attractive development within the     
 original wallls of the old house.     </content>
