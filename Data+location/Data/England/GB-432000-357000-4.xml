		<content>   The construction of Lea Wood Hall   
 was begun in 1870 and completed in    
 1874, being designed by the architect 
 Nezfield. It was originally built for 
 William Walker who owned factory next 
 to John Smedley's (wool factory) which
 made army hats for the Crimean War.   
    The hall stands in approximately   
 eight acres of land. Lea Wood Hall is 
 built from{Derbyshire Sand Stone.}It  
 was originally built as a house with  
 twenty rooms in it.                   
   At the moment the hall is owned by  
 Mr. and Mrs. Green. They say they     
 enjoy living in the hall because it   
 is spacious and away from the hustle  
 and bustle of every day life. They    
 also like the attractive views over   
 the fields that it stands in. The     
 house next door was originally built  
 as the hall's coach house.
