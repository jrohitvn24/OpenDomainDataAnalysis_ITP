		<content> The church of{St. Mary the Virgin}in  
 Sawston. There are many big stone     
 arches and when you rub them chalk    
 comes off on your hands. One part of  
 the church is 200 yrs. younger than   
 the main part which is Norman, dating 
 back to AD 1150. In the chancel       
 thereis a back to front door which    
 once led into a chapel. Under the     
 carpet there is a small brass which   
 tells of John Huddleston, Knight of   
 the bedchamber to King Philip of      
 Spain.The greater part of the church  
 of{St. Peter's in Babraham}is 485 yrs.
 old. Parts of the tower are Norman.   
 There are examples of 12th Century,   
 Gothic and perpendicular architecture.
 The Bush and Benet tomb and the       
 Reredos, given in 1700 by Lady        
 Benet,are features of interest. The   
 vicarage was sold in 1982 to a private
 buyer.                                </content>
