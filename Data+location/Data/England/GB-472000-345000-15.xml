		<content>{Flintham church}is linked with Car    
 Colston and Screveton and is without a
 vicar at the moment. The church, not  
 visible from the Main Street, is in   
 close proximity to Flintham Hall and  
 until 1985 had a Georgian vicarage    
 when it was sold to Flintham Hall     
 Estate. A modern vicarage is being    
 built in Woods Lane, to the chagrin of
 most of the village. The congregation 
 rarely reaches double figures and it  
 is debateable whether the new vicar   
 will improve numbers.{The Chapel}in   
 Spring Lane has a handful of retired  
 people who meet in one of their homes 
 in the winter where it is warmer.     
                                       
{Syerston's church}on their Main Street
 is linked with Sibthorpe, Elston, East
 Stoke and Shelton. Their congregation 
 is frequently one lady with her goat.
