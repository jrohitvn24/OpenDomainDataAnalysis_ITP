		<title>08Godalming Fire Station</title>
		<content> At Godalming Fire Station there are 20
 men, 8 of them full-time. No-one is on
 duty as all the calls go to Reigate   
 then are sent to the stations. Each   
 fire station has a number, Godalming's
 is 24. Each vehicle has a number,     
 Godalming's are 242 and 243. The      
 engines are made by Dennis and Ford.  
 They have approximately 10 call-outs  
 each week, 500-1000 in a year. Our    
 firemen have never been to rescue a   
 cat from a tree but have fought some  
 fierce fires. There is much equipment 
 on each appliance such as pumps,      
 generators, breathing apparatus,      
 winches, lights, ladders etc.. The    
 furthest they have travelled to a fire
 was to the Royal Holloway Sanatorium.
