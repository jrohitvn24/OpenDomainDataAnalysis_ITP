		<title>13Wick Court</title>
		<content> There is a large country house in Wick
 called{Wick Court}.It stands in the   
 middle of the village and was built in
 the first half of the seventeenth     
 century.  The main entrance on the    
 eastern side goes into a square hall  
 which has a floor made of flagstones. 
 To the right of the hall is the dining
 room, to the left is the library.  The
 kitchens are at the rear of the house.
 It has the most important relic.  On  
 the ground floor is a spit wheel which
 originally was turned by a small dog  
 walking around in a space.  Upstairs  
 there is a hidden compartment which   
 still opens at the slightest touch.   
 It is now used as a residential centre
 for school children ,mostly from city 
 areas,who can come and enjoy life in  
 the countryside.
