		<content>{Helston}climbs the slopes of the {    
{Cober Valley}and is situated in the   
 south-west of {Cornwall}.It has a     
 population of about 10,000 people. The
 quaint old market town is surrounded  
 by lush green fields and farms, many  
 of these still owned by the great     
 grandchildren of the original owners. 
                                       
    The older buildings of the town are
 built of {granite}whilst the more     
 modern buildings lack character being 
 built from modern material available  
 throughout the country.               
                                       
  { Helston}is a very old town and     
 originated from the old Celtic Court  
 of {Henlys}. Later it became the Saxon
 manor of {Henlyston,}which in turn    
 became known as the town of Helston.  
 It received its first charter from    
 King John in 1201.                    </content>
