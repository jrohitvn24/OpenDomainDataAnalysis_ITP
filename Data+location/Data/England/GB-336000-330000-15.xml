		<title>15Our part of Ellesmere R.P.C.</title>
		<content>  Since the infamous  Poor Laws and the
 formation of Poor Law Unions, our area
 has been part of a  ring shaped parish
 extending around  Ellesmere. Ellesmere
 Rural Parish  Council  has  12 members
 and  meets  every  month in  Ellesmere
 town  hall. The parish is divided into
 5  wards - Frankton, Tetchill, Lyneal,
 Criftins and Duddleston Heath with the
 first two forming part  of  our  area.
 The role  of  the  parish  council  is
 essentially  that of a pressure group.
 They make  representations to the NSDC
 and  their planners  at  Wem, although
 some  feel that communications between
 parish  and  district could be better.
 Nevertheless,  it  is  felt  that  the
 parish council performs a  vital role,
 fighting for the retention of services
 and the maintenance of roads in a time
 of economic stringency.
