		<title>16The Youth Club:O.&amp; N.Silton</title>
		<content> The Youth Club is held in Kepwick     
 every Wednesday (apart from during    
 school holidays) for children from    
 Over Silton,Nether Silton and Kepwick 
 itself.There are about 40 members aged
 between 7 and l5 and one organiser.   
 My name is Steven and I am 9 years    
 old.I go to the club with my friend   
 Philip in my Dad's car,it takes about 
 5 minutes from Over Silton.When we    
 arrive we help to get out the         
 equipment.We have games such as pool, 
 snooker,table football,darts and      
 dominoes.There are board games too in 
 a wardrobe.After we have had a game I 
 like to buy a drink of coca-cola and  
 sit and talk with Philip.Crisps,sweets
 and chocolate are also available.When 
 Robert comes in we put his breakdance 
 record on the juke box and then we    
 breakdance.Philip's Dad comes to      
 collect us at 8 p.m.                  </content>
