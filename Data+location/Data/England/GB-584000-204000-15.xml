		<title>15SALT WORKS</title>
		<content>   Centuries before Brithnoth fought   
 the battle of Maldon,the Romans sett- 
 led here.One of the reasons they chose
 Maldon was because of the salt which  
 was more valuable than money in those 
 days.The salt water was trapped in    
 little creeks and the sun and wind    
 dried it leaving the salt behind.In   
 the original Domesday Book it says    
 that the Maldon area had 45 salt pans.
  Today Maldon is the only place in the
 country where sea salt is manufactured
 The Maldon Crystal Salt Company have  
 been producing salt for more than 200 
 years.The factory has been modernised 
 but it still makes salt in the same   
 way.The factory is close to the town  
 centre.It is built on the Hythe and is
 one of the main areas where the river 
 can be seen at work.
