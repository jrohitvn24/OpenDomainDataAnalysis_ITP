		<content> The Halstead cycle race started in    
 1953 and so far 32 races have been    
 held. The route travels through the   
 North East Essex countryside. The date
 it took place this year was March     
 17th. Normally the race starts at 11  
 o'clock but due to snow blocking the  
 roads it was delayed until 12.15pm.   
 The Halstead cycle race was sponsored 
 by Hurst the French Derailleur gear   
 concern. This years winner was        
 Gornall. The route was cut down       
 because of the delays caused by the   
 snow on the roads. The winners time   
 was 2hours 30minutes and 34seconds    
 which is very fast as the route is    
 very long.
