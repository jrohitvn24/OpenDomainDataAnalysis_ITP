		<content>     In recent years there has been a  
 dramatic reduction in the number of   
 elm trees, as a result of Dutch Elm   
 Disease.   Fortunately, some of the   
 mature elms have so far survived, but 
 the ash now rivals the elm as the main
 native species.   The ravages of Dutch
 Elm Disease, coupled with the fact    
 that the farmland in the South was    
 once part of a wartime airfield, give 
 the area a rather bare appearance, in 
 which Stow Longa alone remains as a   
 green oasis.                          
     Local residents are making a      
 determined effort to replace dead elms
 with other species, especially near   
 roads.  In particular, the planting of
 horse chestnuts and sycamores on the  
 outskirts of Stow Longa and along the 
 lane to Little Catworth should, in    
 time, restore the leafy appearance of 
 the countryside.                      </content>
