		<title>03BADDESLEY CLINTON MANOR -2-</title>
		<content>  In 1980 the{National Trust}took over 
 the manor house, and opened it to     
 the public in{1982.}It is now in very 
 good condition, thanks to the Trust   
 itself and the help of two very       
 generous local donors who gave an     
{endowment}of Â£300,000.                
                                       
 The house is still{furnished}as it    
 was when the Ferrers family lived     
 there,and therefore it gives an       
 excellent idea of what life used to   
 be like in a small country house. It  
 is as though the family had gone out  
 for a while.                          
                                       
 It costs Â£1.40 to visit the house,and 
 about{44,000 people}do so each year,  
 mainly by car.  This is a very good   
 number for a small and rather remote  
 National Trust property.
