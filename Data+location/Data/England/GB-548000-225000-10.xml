		<title>10School meals</title>
		<content> In our school, we have our own kitchen
 and cook, who caters for whoever      
 wishes to have school meals. People   
 who don't have them either go home for
 dinners or bring sandwiches. A dinner 
 for one day costs 63p, so for a week  
 it costs Â£3.15p. The school uses a    
 cafeteria system, where children can  
 choose what they want from a wide     
 range of foods. One meal consists of  
 10 'points'. The main part of the meal
 consists of 4 points, the next (such  
 as chips or a salad) is 2 points, and 
 you can have something like peas or   
 baked beans for one point. On the next
 course you can use up the rest of your
 points on a pudding and a drink.
