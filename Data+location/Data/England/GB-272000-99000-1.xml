		<title>01BOW VILLAGE IN 1985</title>
		<content> Bow bridge has been rebuilt to cope   
 with floods and road widened to take  
 the traffic passing through the main  
 street.The village is gradually       
 spreading itself in all directions,but
 mainly southwards,where new bungalows 
 council and private are being built.  
 The village shops are still being used
 but many people go to the towns for   
 shopping.The raised cobbled bank      
 running down one side of the village  
 has become a conservation area and a  
 pathway of nonslip bricks laid        
 throughout its length.Listed buildings
 include the old School House,Winsor   
 House and Top Chapel House.The Parish 
 Council enter the best kept village   
 competition each year.
