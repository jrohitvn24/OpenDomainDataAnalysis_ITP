		<content>      Although Bedlington does not have
 a book shop, it holds an annual Book  
 Fayre, which is organised by          
 Mid-Northumberland Arts Group and our 
 library.  Sinces its conception in    
 l983, the Fayre has increased in size 
 and scope.  This year it lasted a     
 week, attracted 2,000 people and      
 provided a wide variety of cultural   
 events* these included a potter       
 display: recitations by Carol Wensby  
 Scott, a local author, a concert by   
 Johnny Handel, a local musician: a    
 magic lantern show; various book      
 displays.  The Fayre has attracted    
 many celebrities from the world of    
 literature, theatre and television.   
 The annual (Bedlington Miner's Picnic)
 provide the community with a focus    
 for political debate and family fun.  
 There has been no picnic this year due
 to lack of funds.                     </content>
