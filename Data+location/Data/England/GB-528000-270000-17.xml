		<title>17Health food shop, St Ives</title>
		<content> This health food shop in St Ives is   
 called The Good Life. It is open six  
 days a week from 9.15 am to 5.00 pm.  
 It contains a wide variety of         
 unprocessed food, dried fruit, herbs, 
 spices, nuts, beans and various types 
 of unprocessed flour. The products    
 come from all over the world. Some    
 roots, to flavour cooking come, from  
 China whilst many herbs are grown in  
 Britain. The shop owner believes that 
 people are now more careful about what
 they eat - wanting less heavily       
 processed food which has much natural 
 goodness taken out. He enjoys advising
 people on the use of herbs and spices 
 in cooking and sells a number of books
 on this subject. He stocks homeopathic
 medicines and herbs with medicinal    
 properties and will give information  
 on their use but does not go against  
 the advice of a qualified doctor.     </content>
