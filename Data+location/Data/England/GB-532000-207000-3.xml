		<title>03BRICKENDON CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The Chapel was built in 1931/32 and   
 consecrated in 1933.It was designed to
 simulate a converted timber barn,in   
 keeping with the surroundings.The     
 dedication is to "The Holy Cross and  
 St.Alban",the former because          
 Brickendon Manor used to belong to the
 Abbey of Waltham (Waltham Holy Cross) 
 and the latter from the Patron Saint  
 of the diocese.The vicar and curates  
 are shared with the neighbouring      
 churches of Bayford and Essendon and  
 the present vicar's wife is a         
 Deaconess.A prominent feature of the  
 grounds of the Chapel is a Great Cross
 of oak,designed by Alexander Nairne,  
 erected in 1931.                      
 Evensong is the most popular service  
 each Sunday.
