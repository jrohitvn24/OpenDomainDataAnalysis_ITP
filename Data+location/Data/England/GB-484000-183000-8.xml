		<title>08PIG FARMING.</title>
		<content>   Pinkneys Green Farm, Maidenhead is  
 quite an old farm, some of its        
 buildings are over 100 years old. It  
 is chiefly an arable farm, but it does
 have a small herd of pigs.            
   You can hear the noise from the     
 three pig-sties from quite a distance.
 We were allowed to stroke the animals.
 Their noses felt wet and quivering,   
 and their skins were very hard and    
 bristly. The pigs often get angry and 
 fight each other, and although their  
 skins are very hard, they get lots of 
 cuts. If they see blood, that makes   
 them even angrier, so the walls of the
 pig-sties are painted red to hide the 
 blood splashes.                       
   The pigs are reared on dried pig    
 pellets, and on any waste food that   
 the farmer can get. When they have    
 been fattened they are then marketed  
 for pork and bacon.                   </content>
