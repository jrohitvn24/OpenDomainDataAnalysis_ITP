      My grandad remembers that it was 
 the last Wednesday in June 1940 when  
 the German planes arrived from Lessay 
 in nearby France.  They dropped 3     
 bombs in La Rocque.  One landed on the
 slipway, another on the beach and the 
 last one landed on the road.  Three   
 people died as a result.  A Mr        
 Pilkington got his foot blown off and 
 was taken to hospital in St. Helier,  
 where he died.  As the planes swooped 
 down, people ran into the tomato crops
 to hide.  My grandad had left his     
 handcart on the slipway at La Rocque. 
 The bomb that landed on the slipway   
 blew it to bits.  When he returned he 
 couldn't find even a splinter left.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
