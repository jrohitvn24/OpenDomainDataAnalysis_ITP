		<content> It is thought that there are about 13 
{fallow deer}on the Halsey estate and  
 also some{barking deer.}They are very 
 small. They are protected on the farm.
 A deer has been seen near Ledgemore   
 Lane. Watkins Pightle,the field behind
 the school, is full of rabbits. Moles 
 too! Our Headmaster saw a fox when he 
 was giving out leaflets for the car   
 boot sale. There are many pheasants   
 too. One of the parents raises        
 pheasants. Mr.Halsey is going to as   
 well. Birds nest all round the school 
 buildings. A swallow is nesting over  
 the canteen door. Grey squirrels are  
 common too. Mr.Badcock grows nettles  
 for the{wall brown butterfly.}There   
 are bluebells down School Lane, and   
 there are old meadows nearby with{rare
{orchids.}We haven't seen a badger but 
 we know they are around. There are    
 lots of thick woods.                  </content>
