		<title>09Employment in Shenstone</title>
		<content>I don't no how many unemployed there   
are in Shenstone, I expect there are a 
few  but I know the majority of working
people go out of the village to work.  
There aren't many places in Shenstone  
to work. Most of the shop owners live  
in Shenstone, only a couple live out of
the village, but most of the teachers  
live out of the village, only one lives
in the village. If the plans for more  
development go ahead, will Shenstone   
become a dormatory? I asked 7 people if
there mums and dads work in the        
village. The majority did say there    
mums and dads worked out of the        
village. A couple of mums don't work.  
This is a chart of the 7 couples I     
asked.                                 
   PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE VILLAGE: 4  
   PEOPLE THAT DON'T WORK IN THE       
VILLAGE: 7                             
   PEOPLE THAT DON'T WORK: 3. J.BASS   </content>
