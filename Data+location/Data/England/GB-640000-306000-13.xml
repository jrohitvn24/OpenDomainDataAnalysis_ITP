		<title>13Rural Landscape</title>
		<content> The landscape of the area has changed 
 over the last thirty years due to the 
 increase in field size as a result of 
 mechanisation. This change has been   
 slow and not too harsh.               
 The woodland has remained unaltered   
 and although some marshland has been  
 ploughed the overall effect remains as
 it did years ago. The area is         
 considered to be of great natural     
 beauty wiht its gently sweeping arable
 fields interspersed with alder carr   
 and woodland, and the wide open       
 marshes to the east.                  
 Many old farm buildings remain eg.    
 thatched barns, cartsheds and farm    
 cottages. Modern buildings such as    
 asbestos sheds and corn silos have    
 been erected but within a couple of   
 years they become covered with        
 litchens or mosses and this helps to  
 blend them into the landscape.        </content>
