		<title>14PIGEON BREEDING IN HAUGHTON.</title>
		<content> The members of Bunbury Homing Society 
 breed their own pigeons and take great
 interest in improving the strain and  
 therefore the birds performance. Two  
 of our fanciers race in National races
 which are a great test for the birds. 
 Clear water and fresh corn are        
 provided daily and much care must be  
 given to the pigeons' loft,especially 
 cleanliness, correct lighting and     
 heating. The sexes must be separated  
 except in the breeding season and     
 young birds must also be kept separ-  
 ately after weaning. They must be     
 given regular flying time and have to 
 be tossed away from home in prep-     
 aration for races, to develop muscle  
 and the homing instinct. Prizes are   
 awarded within the club and the       
 federation. Pigeon racing is a sport  
 for all ages and raises a lot of money
 for charities.                        </content>
