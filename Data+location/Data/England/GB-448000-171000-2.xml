		<title>02CURRIDGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Curridge school was originally a      
 church and a school house owned by    
 Prior's Court for family worship. It  
 was donated to the village by the     
 Parish of Chieveley in the late 19th  
 century. In 1965 the church closed and
 there is now a Primary school there.  
 One end of the junior classroom is    
 semi-circular and used to have stained
 glass windows and contained the altar.
 On the outside walls there are cross  
 shaped patterns made with different   
 brick. It is a small school with only 
 40 pupils and 2 full-time teachers.   
 This year the oldest children have had
 the opportunity to do a science       
 project in other schools with other   
 children, but mostly our school day is
 spent here. 21 of the pupils live at  
 the School of Military Survey and may 
 well move to or from other parts of   
 the world.                            </content>
