		<title>15Farmers' Attitudes</title>
		<content> All Dairy Farms have had to cut their 
 milk quota by{9%.                     
 In this area some actually reduced the
 milk yield and some reduced the size  
 of their herd.One small farmer felt   
 the quota was unfair as the government
 assessed the yield on a poor year for 
 him.All the farmers felt that they    
{would not}wish to leave the{E.E.C.    
 All our farmers felt that they should 
 respect the country side within reason
 and that wildlife should be controlled
 if necessary.{Foxes}and particularly  
{rabbits}were a nuisance.The Hunt,a    
 pack of hounds and guns,were some     
 methods used.{Badgers}were not a      
 problem at present.                   
 One farmer was upset at{losing}good   
 land to road improvements and had     
 major problems with{litter}and{rubbish
 being dumped on his farmland.It was a 
 danger to his animals.                </content>
