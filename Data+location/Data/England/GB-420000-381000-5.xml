  THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE REC
 WAS HELD AT THE INSTITUTE ON THE 22ND 
 OF MAY 1985.THE CHAIRMAN,MR.J.E.      
 COCKING,GAVE THE FOLLOWING REPORT.    
 "THE YEAR UNDER REVIEW HAS BEEN A     
 RELATIVELY QUIET ONE BUT THE          
 MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE  HAS BEEN LOOKING
 INTO THE FUTURE AND PLANNING AHEAD,   
 SO AS TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE     
 RECREATION GROUND.SMALL ,BUT USEFUL   
 IMPROVEMENTS TO THE GROUND HAVE       
 BEEN MADE, NOTABLY THE NEW CARPARK, IN
 THE N.W. CORNER OF THE GROUND.        
 THE SIDE CUTTING GRASS MOWER WE       
 OBTAINED HAS PROVED VERY USEFUL AND   
 CAPABLE OF OPERATING EVEN WHEN SMALL  
 STONES ARE PRESENT.
