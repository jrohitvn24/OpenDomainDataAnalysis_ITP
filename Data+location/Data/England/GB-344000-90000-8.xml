		<content>      Bridport's traditonal rope and   
 net making industry is now almost     
 entirely sited in the northern half of
 the town outside this survey area.    
      The oldest industry in the       
 southern half of Bridport is Palmer's 
 Brewery which stands on the site of an
 old mill dating back to 1794. The     
 Brewery today serves about seventy    
 Palmer's Houses in Bridport and West  
 Dorset. It produces traditionally     
 brewed draught and bottled beers.     
      The main trading estate is named 
 St. Michael's. It contains many small 
 businesses including D-I-Y, a tyre    
 company, a carpenter's workshop, a    
 printing works, warehouses, etc. To   
 the west is the newer Dreadnought     
 trading estate which also contains a  
 number of small businesses including a
 wholesale fruit market, a car         
 repairers, engraving works, etc.      </content>
