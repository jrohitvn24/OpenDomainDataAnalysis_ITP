		<title>05 THE THORLEY DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content>                                       
 Bishop's Stortford's new suburb at    
Thorley was conceived in the 1960s     
when Government said money would be    
given for development. The  project    
was designed to provide 3000 houses &amp;  
increase population by 9000. In 1973   
the council bought 104 acres of        
farmland to the south west of          
town.However the project was halted    
until 1977.Elliot Ltd.constructed the  
first 123 houses.The council then      
negotiated with several building       
firms.Land remained in the council's   
ownership until each house             
sold.Recently land has been sold       
outright while planning control has    
been retained.The boom at Thorley      
began in 1981 &amp; the area has rapidly   
developed on the fringes of an old     
market town.
