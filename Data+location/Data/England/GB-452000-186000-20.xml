		<title>20E.Hagbourne area-conclusions</title>
		<content>It is important to note that although  
East Hagbourne and the other villages  
are close to Didcot, with its fast and 
frequent rail services to London and   
Oxford, the majority of residents have 
lived in the area for at least 6 years 
and many of them for over 20years.     
There have been few newcomers to the   
area and generally it has not seen the 
new housing developments that have     
marked the expansion of many South     
Oxfordshire villages in recent times - 
a fact most residents applaud!         
This survey has been carried out by    
pupils at St Birinus School for boys,  
Didcot, with the aid of Humanities     
staff. Most of the work was carried out
by first year boys, but boys from other
years have made significant            
contributions.
