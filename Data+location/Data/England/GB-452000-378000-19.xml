 the same time, when sets were all     
 black and white. As a child she lived 
 at{Spinkhill,}near{Killamarsh,}where  
 she attended{school}and learned       
 reading, writing, arithmetic, sewing  
 and knitting. In the playground the   
 favourite games were skipping, whips  
 and tops, badminton, battle board,    
 which was a type of wooden racquet,   
 and hoops. After{school}she would help
 her mother with the housework and with
 preparing the{meals,}which were often 
 porridge or soup. After leaving       
 school she was employed in service as 
 a maid, having a holiday once a year  
 at{Cleethorpes.}She finds much of     
 todays fashions "silly", especially   
 the young people who have coloured    
 hair or wear it in a spiky, Mohican   
 style. Changes in services are now    
 worse, with no shops or Post Office.  </content>
