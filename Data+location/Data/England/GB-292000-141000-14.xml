		<content> The Minehead Harriers have their      
 kennels in Huntsham, between          
 Timberscombe and Wooton Courtenay.The 
 kennels used to be in Minehead but in 
 1956 they moved to Huntsham and rented
 it from Mr. Gooding. In 1965 Miss Lumb
 bought the kennels and gave it to the 
 Harriers as their permanent home. The 
 hunt covers 33 square miles from      
 Dunster to Wheddon Cross, Bladgon     
 Cross to Webbers Post, Horner to      
 Porlock.They start hunting cubs in    
 September but they really start to    
 hunt in November. They hunt from      
 November to March. They hunt twice a  
 week, on Wednesday and Saturday. The  
 subscription is $75.00 a year.
