		<content>    Arreton School was established in  
 1833. The original classroom is stone 
 built and the school house is a       
 mixture of stone and brick. The second
 classroom is brick built and the hall 
 is a timber building.                 
    The 43 children at present on roll 
 are aged between 4 and 9.  There is   
 one head teacher, one class teacher   
 and a half_time teacher.              
    The school catchment area          
 encompasses the two villages of       
 Arreton and Merston and the           
 surrounding areas of Hale Common,     
 Bathingbourne, Downend and Blackwater.
    The school meals are delivered from
 the central canteen at Nine Acres     
 school, Newport.
