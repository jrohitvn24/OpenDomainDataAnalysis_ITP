		<title>15AT LITTLE PLUMSTEAD SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We visited Little Plumstead{school    
 which is in a{rural}area. When it was 
 first built in{1865}there was one     
 classroom. That is now the dining     
 room. Since the school was built three
 extensions have been added to it. The 
 first was in 1881 when it was enlarged
 to take 120 pupils.Today there are 97 
 children in the school. The site      
 covers about 2 acres,including the    
 playing field across the road. Here   
 they have a running track and a       
 jumping pit. There are four classes in
 the school,the age group is 5-11.     
 There are 18  in the first class,25 in
 the second,26 in the third and 28 in  
 the fourth class. The children do lots
 of activities including swimming at a 
 senior school near Norwich. The school
 has 4 staff and a secretary.They do   
 not have a crossing patrol or a can-  
 teen;but the children like the school.</content>
