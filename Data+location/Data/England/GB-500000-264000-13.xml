		<title>13Oakley Hunt, Melchbourne</title>
		<content> The Oakley Hunt Kennels are situated  
 on the Knotting Road, approximately   
 1.5 miles west of Melchbourne.        
 The Kennels moved here from Milton    
 Ernest in 1974. The buildings were all
 purpose built and include; housing for
 the staff, lodges for the             
 hounds,stables for the hunt horses    
 plus many barns and outbuildings.     
 The hunting season begins on 1st.     
 November and Meets take place on      
 Tuesdays and Saturdays.               
 Prior to the hunting season  andas    
 soon as the harvest has been          
 completed, cub hunting starts. This   
 spreads the litters of cubs and is    
 also used to train young hounds. It is
 done over a limited area, unlike      
 hunting where the hope is to run a    
 long way. The O akley Hunt covers     
 North Bedfordshire and parts of       
 northants and Bucks.                  </content>
