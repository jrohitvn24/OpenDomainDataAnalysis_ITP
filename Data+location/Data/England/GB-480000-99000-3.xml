		<content> Shipton Green is a small hamlet about 
 1 mile West of Birdham.  It consists  
 of private dwellings set back from the
 road with a wide stretch of grass in  
 front of many of the houses. The      
 houses are either converted and       
 enlarged agricultural cottages built  
 late 19th or early 20th centuries with
 more modern detatched or              
 semi-detatched houses built between or
 after the wars. There is a builders'  
 merchants which has developed over the
 past few years from a building firm   
 through a "do-it-yourself" shop to its
 present function. The Itchenor Caravan
 Park has caravans for sale or hire.   
 There are 2 nurseries, one growing    
 flowers and the other providing       
 vegetables for sale in its own shop.
