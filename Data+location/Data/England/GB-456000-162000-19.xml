		<title>19A NEWCOMER TO ALDERMASTON</title>
		<content> Blue Circle Industries PLC are        
 newcomers to the area. Their new      
 international headquarters at         
 Aldermaston opened in September 1985. 
 The 137 acre Aldermaston Court Estate 
 with its listed mansion, lake and park
 has been transformed by architect     
 Richard Gilbert Scott at a cost of Â£12
 million. His new office complex       
 overlooking the lake is both very     
 modern and attractive! The restored   
 mansion will provide restaurant and   
 conference facilities. Half the staff 
 of 400 have been recruited locally.   
 The move to Aldermaston has united    
 many formerly dispersed sites with an 
 estimated saving of 40% on admin      
 costs. Aldermaston was chosen because 
 the proximity to airports and major   
 roads gives easy access to all parts  
 of the country while still being only 
 an hour from London.                  </content>
