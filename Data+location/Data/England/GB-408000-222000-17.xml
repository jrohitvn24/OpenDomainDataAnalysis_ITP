		<title>17GUITING POWER.LIGHT INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>    In our village is an agricultural  
 contractor. He injects ammonia into   
 straw to make it fit for animals to   
 eat.He transports the ammonia to the  
 farm and works there. He uses a Unimog
 to pull the trailer which carries the 
 ammonia tank.                         
    The Unimog is like a tractor and   
 runs on tractor tyres. It runs on     
 diesel and uses 50 gallons of fuel    
 weekly. Its motor is 100 h.p. and     
 could pull 100tons but the legal      
 weight is 24 tons.                    
    The contractor has an agent who    
 advertises for him,and fixes his jobs.
 He likes working in a village,as there
 are many farms around, and the farmers
 know him. He thinks that light        
 industries are important in a village,
 and help to keep it alive.
