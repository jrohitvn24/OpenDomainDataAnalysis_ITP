		<content>   On Saturdays,I wake up at 8.30 a.m. 
 and have breakfast -branflakes and    
 milk,toast and a cup of tea.I then get
 washed and dressed.                   
  At 10.00 a.m.I go to my friend's     
 house where I play on his computer    
 until lunch. I go home for lunch and  
 in the afternoon I go to Maidenhead   
 for Breakdancing.After this I go home 
 for tea and sometimes go out on my    
 bike.                                 
  I stay at home in the evening and we 
 normally rent a video film for        
 Saturday, and then I go to bed at     
 11.00 p.m. which is later than my     
 weektime bedtime at 10.00 p.m.        
  Sundays are very similar, but I spend
 more time on my B.M.X.bike and do not 
 go "breaking".                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
