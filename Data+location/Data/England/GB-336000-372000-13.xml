		<title>13ELLESMERE PORT-THE PLAYBUS.</title>
		<content> The Playbus is an ordinary double-    
 decker bus converted to accommodate a 
 pre-school playgroup with toys,books, 
 games,sand,paints &amp; basic crafts.It   
 has nine sessions a week during the   
 school term and is staffed by three   
 paid helpers including a teacher.The  
 rest of the work is done by parents as
 a charity group.At present 58 children
 attend &amp; there is a long waiting list.
 Working in such confined space,with a 
 ratio of five children per adult,there
 is an infant class atmosphere where   
 children can be taught basic skills in
 preparation for school.This includes a
 certain amount of discipline and the  
 social aspect of co-operation.Children
 are taught an awareness of texture,   
 colour,weather &amp; time of year etc.They
 make their own cards &amp; presents for   
 special days.There are only nineteen  
 registered playbuses in Great Britain.</content>
