{of 55,000;}2 distinct shopping centres
 several public open spaces including  
 the North Downs, &amp; much high class    
 housing. The estimated product of     
 penny rate for 85/86 is Â£192,700.     
    This{prosperous area}has regular   
 train services to London, Brighton,   
 Tonbridge &amp; Reading, and a good road  
 net-work. Gatwick airport is 5 miles  
 south.  The rapid growth of offices &amp; 
 light industry has resulted in low    
 unemployment - 5.1% - in the area.    
   {Reigate}has several interesting    
 features - the Old Town Hall (1728),  
 the Priory, the Baron's Cave &amp; the    
 medieval church of St.Mary Magdalene. 
   {Redhill}was built after the coming 
 of the railway. The town centre is    
 being re-developed &amp; a new shopping/  
 civic centre opens later this year.   
 There is an excellent sports centre.  </content>
