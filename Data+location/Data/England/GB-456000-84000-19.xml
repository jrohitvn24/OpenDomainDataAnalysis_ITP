		<content>{3.WATER MEADOWS}Water meadows cover   
 quite a large part of the area and    
 many damp loving plants can be found  
 here.  They include bullrushes, reeds 
 of different types, watercress, and   
 marsh marigolds.  Water birds such as 
 coots, ducks and moorhens can be seen 
 and water voles and foxes are common. 
                                       
{4.ROUGHLAND}These areas of coarse,    
 long grass hide many small mammals,   
 insects and birds.  A large variety of
 different plants grow in a jumble.    
 Roughland tends to look very wild but 
 it is often the home of more plants   
 and animals than the other areas.
