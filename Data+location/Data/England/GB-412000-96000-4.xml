		<title>04THE NORTH LODGE</title>
		<content>    The North Lodge stands at the      
 Northern entrance to{Hurn Court}on the
  ite of the original single storey    
 gate house.                           
    The new house is made of red brick 
 which has some blue and yellow in it. 
 The house has two bay windows, one at 
 the front and one at the side of the  
 house. It has red drainpipes and all  
  he woodwork is a creamy yellow. This 
 is because Lady Malmesbury wanted this
 house to be different to all the rest 
 because this is the house where she   
 stayed.  The other cottages are cream 
 and green .                           
    The house has nine rooms three of  
 which are bedrooms, and there is a    
 modern kitchen.  The fireplace in the 
 lounge is a new one but it has been   
 made to look old.
