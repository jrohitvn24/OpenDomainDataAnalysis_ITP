		<content> On most mornings my mam,sister and I  
 have breakfast;usually my dad is in   
 bed after working on nightshifts.My   
 mam usually takes us to school in the 
 car.I get there just in time for a    
 game of football before the bell      
 goes.We all have to get lined up in   
 the yard before we go in.In class,we  
 do topic work which is about different
 countries.                            
  Most of the class enjoy it.On Monday 
 nights I go to the school computer    
 club.It runs on two nights Mondays and
 Tuesdays and I enjoy it because you   
 can learn how to programme and        
 understand computers.                 
  My dad is a policeman and I dont see 
 much of him because his shifts are    
 changing all of the time.             
  On Saturday I go to the swimming     
 baths at the Galleries while my mam   
 and sister are shopping.              </content>
