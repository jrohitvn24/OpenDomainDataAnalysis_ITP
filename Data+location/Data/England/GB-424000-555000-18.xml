		<content> In Birtley there are two main         
 churches. One is called St. Josephs   
 which is a Roman Catholic church, the 
 other main church is St Johns which is
 a Church of England church. There is  
 also a Methodist church in Birtley,   
 which was built on Station Lane. There
 are two little churches, the Salvation
 Army which is on Lansbury Drive, and  
 the Assembly of God which is near the 
 Salvation Army.                       
    There is a church in Lamesley which
 is called St Andrews. There are two   
 churches in Kibblesworth. One is      
 Methodist.                            
    The vicar from St. Johns comes to  
 our school every week. He used to take
 the service, but now he takes some    
 pupils for singing. Churches also have
 clubs like Boys Brigade, Cubs and     
 Guides. Our Headmaster was ordained a 
 priest on June 3Oth 1985.             </content>
