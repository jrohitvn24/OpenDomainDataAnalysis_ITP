		<content>{Fishing and the beach:}Most of the    
 fish caught is cod,haddock,halibut    
 or plaice.We occasionaly get seals and
 whales and sharks have been seen      
 further out to sea .Most of our       
 fishing is done in Norwegian water.We 
 have a large problem with ships       
 getting stuck in the Humber on the    
 sandbanks which are very near the     
 surface.There isn't a speed limit in  
 the sea but you aren't allowed to go  
 to fast when you are coming into      
 dock.At Sutton we have groins or      
 breakerwaters to stop sand            
 drifts.These are placed diagonally    
 across the beach about 13metres       
 apart.We used to have a lot of        
 fish near here but most of them have  
 been killed.
