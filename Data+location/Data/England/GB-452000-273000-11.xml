		<title>11Abbots or Abbotts</title>
		<content>    Why is there a difference in the   
 spelling of "Abbot" in Abbots Farm    
 School and "Abbott" in Abbotts Way?   
 Both spellings occur in the minutes of
 the Borough and County Councils.      
    It has been Suggested that the name
 derives from the Abbot of Pipewell or 
 a family called Abbot(t) who used to  
 own the land on which the estate and  
 schools were built. In the old days   
 there were frequently variations in   
 the spelling of surnames. A map going 
 back to the end of the last century   
 shows a house called "Abbots". There  
 is also reference to an "Abbott       
 Charity" at around the same time.     
    No doubt both versions can be      
 justified, but it would have been     
 tidier if only one of them had been   
 adopted for both school and road.
