		<title>10MRS WATSON AND THE REST</title>
		<content> The current{population}of Doddinghurst
 and Kelvedon Hatch is 5659. Few of the
 population have lived here all their  
 lives. Our survey shows that 50% moved
 here from London, 32% from surrounding
 districts and 18% from other parts of 
 Britain. 8 of our children have       
 parents who originate from other      
 countries.                            
{Mrs Watson}is one of our oldest and   
 best known citizens. She is now in    
 her 86th year and works 7 days a week 
 in her shop. Mrs Watson moved to the  
 area on her marriage in 1934; she and 
 her husband opened the shop and       
 started a cafe. At that time this was 
 the only building around. The cafe was
 used particularly by cyclist touring  
 the country side. The cafe closed in  
 1970 when her son took over the       
 running of the shop, but Mrs Watson   
 still takes a very active part.       </content>
