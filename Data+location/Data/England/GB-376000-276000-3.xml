		<content>      Much of the housing in the area  
 is expensive commuter housing, the    
 value being enhanced by the rural     
 surroundings and close proximity to   
 the West Midlands towns. There are    
 still some farm houses and farm       
 workers' accommodation, but there is a
 trend towards older properties being  
 converted into luxury accommodation,  
 making it difficult for young couples 
 to buy homes near their families. The 
 exception is the Meadow Rise          
 development in the SW corner of the   
 area where there is a range of        
 moderately-priced housing and rented  
 Council property. Sample prices are:  
   5-bedroomed luxury house in Trimpley
 with 2 bathrooms and 1 acre of land:  
 Â£125,000                              
   3-bedroomed house in Meadow Rise    
 with central heating and small garden:
 detached Â£29,000;semi-detached Â£26,000</content>
