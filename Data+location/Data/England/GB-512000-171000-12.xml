		<title>12LOCAL AMENITIES AND USERS</title>
		<content> Within the area surveyed there are    
 only two important amenities.         
 1. two adjacent golf courses          
 2. A portion of Royal Bushy Park      
 Most of the visitors we interviewed   
 stay for over 30 mins and go to the   
 park every day, usually by walking or 
 cycling and take over 30 mins to reach
 it. All thought facilities were good  
 but suggestions for improvements      
 included more toilets drinking        
 fountains litter bins and more staff. 
 Of the golf clubs one is is a first   
 class private championship course. The
 second is municipal owned.Most golfers
 play regularly, several daily. Most   
 players arrived by car, only one by   
 train. Facilities were rated          
 excellent, but suggested improvements 
 were better bunkers, course lock up at
 night,better clubhouse and greens.
