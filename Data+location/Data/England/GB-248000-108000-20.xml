		<title>20PETROCKSTOWE FARM MACHINERY</title>
		<content> There are no working horses on the 14 
{Petrockstowe}farms, but{39 tractors,  
 which with their many attachments do  
 so much work,from ploughing to harvest
 &amp; enable the large area to be farmed  
 by so few people. One farmhouse dates 
 back to l3th Century, 5 to the 17th &amp; 
 3 to the 19th. There are at least 28  
{cob outbuildings}still in everyday use
 - shippons, barns &amp; looseboxes - but  
 also plenty of traditional stone &amp;    
 numerous modern steel-frame buildings.
 Four farms do not have mains water,   
 but there are 16 wells &amp; many springs.
 Only 3 farms have a generator but 8   
 have a mechanical milking parlour &amp; 10
 have a roller mill. Most farms use    
 outside contractors to shear and for  
 ditching/drainage work. Milk is col-  
 lected daily from farms by a tanker   
 lorry. Seed, fertilisers &amp; most equip-
 ment is bought from farm co-operatives</content>
