		<title>01WADE MARSH,ISLE OF THANET</title>
		<content>     The area lies near the Thanet     
resorts next to Minnis Bay and is      
virtually uninhabited.                 
     It consists of coastal farmland   
intersected by drainage channels       
including the large Wansum channel,    
the original boundary of the Isle of   
Thanet dividing it from the mainland   
of Kent.                               
     Having been subjected to          
inundation by the sea, notably in 1953 
in recent times, it is now protected   
by a sea wall surmounted by a narrow   
roadway. This has changed the nature   
of the area from a wetland into        
farmland, mostly intensively           
cultivated.                            
     The high fertility of the area    
produces up to three crops in two      
years - mostly barley, root crops and  
brassica varieties.
