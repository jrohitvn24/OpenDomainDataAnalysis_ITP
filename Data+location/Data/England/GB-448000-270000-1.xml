		<content>   This area is mainly of a rural      
 nature,with a pocket of new housing   
 estates to the north-west and the old,
 attractive village of{Dunchurch}      
 (mentioned in the original Domesday   
 book) in the west.                    
   Mixed farming is the predominant    
 form of agriculture.                  
   The M45 motorway,which connects     
 south Coventry to the M1 motorway,    
 passes east to west through the center
 of the area.                          
   In the east of the block,a disused  
 railway line,once part of the Great   
 Central Railway between Nottingham and
 Marylebone Station,London,runs north  
 to south. Onley Youth Custody Center, 
 which houses approximately 400 young  
 offenders,is another major feature of 
 the area.
