		<title>11Geology around Heybridge</title>
		<content>    The town of Maldon itself sits on a
 hill which is composed of boulder clay
    Around Heybridge the soil is mainly
 sandy loams which means the soil is   
 very gravelly.Sandy loams occur along 
 the main river valleys such as the    
 Blackwater and Chelmer.               
    Underneath sandy loams are layers  
 of gravel and sand.They are extracted 
 by companies and are sold to help     
 build roads and houses.The main two   
 gravel pits in the area are at Loft   
 Farm (Grid ref. 8607,0901) and        
 Chigborough Pits (Grid ref.           
 8706,0804).                           
    There is some local opposition to  
 further gravel pit working which is   
 now a thriving local{industry.}       
 However, the companies have landscaped
 and stocked with fish exhausted       
 workings and have thus increased the{ 
 area's{recreational}facilities.       </content>
