		<title>07RIVENDELL NURSERIES Ltd.</title>
		<content> We went along to Rivendell Nurseries  
 and interviewed the manager Mr.       
 Christopher Wright . The Nursery      
 started off small but grew quite      
 rapidly and is now a large garden     
 centre with many customers .It grows  
 about 80% of their own plants and get 
 the rest from nurseries abroad .The   
 manager and his staff are trying to   
 improve performance by using a        
 computer to help them water the       
 plants.This change will help business 
 by saving time and trouble .The       
 nursery is very popular,it sells many 
 things ranging from garden fertilizers
 to Japanese ornaments.However,        
 Rivendell is'nt the only nursery in   
 the area ,Pilkingtons 1km to the north
 is much bigger and more popular so    
 Rivendell has a bit of competition.
