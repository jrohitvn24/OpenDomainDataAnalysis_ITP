		<title>05THE FARMING YEAR LAMBING</title>
		<content>   My name is Sonia Richards.We live on
 a mixed farm.{It is lambing time.     
   Dad has to get up at 5.00 am.       
 First he looks round the building     
 where we keep the sheep that will soon
 lamb.                                 
                                       
  Some lambs are too big and get stuck 
 in their mothers then Dad has to      
 help.He finds the leg of the lamb and 
 pulls on it until the lambs head is   
 out then the sheep does the rest.     
                                       
  A sheep sometimes has twins and      
 hasn't enough milk forboth of them so 
 we take one of them and they are fed  
 by us from a bottle.We keep them warm 
 by using four bales of straw in a     
 square with a sheet of tin over the   
 top.Dad checks them six times         
 a day.                                
                                       </content>
