 This is an area of very broken country
 dropping away to the North of a high  
 ridge, rising again, slightly, to     
 a more level area running NW to SE. It
 contains three small villages and     
 a number of farming hamlets, the NW   
 corner just touches the residential   
 outskirts of the town of Ilminster.   
 The land cover is predominantly       
 pasture, a mixture of enclosed rough  
 grazing in the bottoms of the coombs  
 and valleys, becoming intensively     
 managed grassland as the land rises   
 and levels out. On the higher area the
 land cover becomes arable with a      
 variety of grains and root crops,     
 including potatoes, and commercial    
 orchard.                              
 There is a small amount of mainly     
 deciduous woodland and a large number 
 of hedgerow trees.                    </content>
