		<content>{BRIDLEPATHS}- THESE ARE PUBLIC RIGHTS 
 OF WAY FOR HORSES, PEDESTRIANS AND    
 CYCLISTS.                             
                                       
 BRIDLEPATH TO HARDWICK. - THIS IS     
 SIGNPOSTED AT ROAD NEAR JASON FARM    
 KENNELS.  IT IS A VERY PLEASANT WALK  
 IN DRY WEATHER,ALTHOUGH THE SHORT     
 STRETCH ALONGSIDE HARDWICK WOOD SEEMS 
 TO STAY MUDDY ALL YEAR ROUND. DURING  
 THE WINTER THE WHOLE WALK CAN BE      
 RATHER MUDDY, THIS SITUATION BEING    
 AGGRAVATED BY HORSES USING THE PATH.  
 THE FIRST SECTION OF THE WALK IS      
 ALONGSIDE PASTURE AS FAR AS HARDWICK  
 WOOD, THEN THROUGH ARABLE FIELDS.     
 THERE ARE GOOD VIEWS TOWARDS TOFT AS  
 THE RISE NEAR HARDWICK IS REACHED,    
 FIELDS STRETCHING AS FAR AS THE EYE   
 CAN SEE.   {
