		<title>13Keadby Lock</title>
		<content> It is situated at the eastern end of  
 the canal where it meets the River    
 Trent.Notices displayed remind one of 
 the danger of rabies.The lock sides   
 were built by masons who milled the   
 stones exactly so metal ties sufficed 
 instead of mortar.On the river side of
 the lock gates roman numerals have    
 been carved into the stone side to    
 indicate the depth of the river.The   
 lock keeper cannot pen when the river 
 gets to a depth of 6.3m as that is the
 height of the canal.The 1st and 3rd   
 gates of the lock are flood gates,the 
 others being canal gates.The gates and
 balancing beams are made of solid oak.
 It is a wide beam lock 6.6m wide;the  
 canal lock is 26.1m long and the flood
 lock 22.8m long.The floor of the lock 
 is oak panelled.In November this year 
 it is due to be dewatered for repair- 
 work and the sides will be landscaped.</content>
