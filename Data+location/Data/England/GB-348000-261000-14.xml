		<content>  In Luston the{District Nurse}comes   
 around every week.Lucky for us there  
 has never been anything serious,but   
 we still have the odd bugs that go    
 around but they soon get better and   
 it's back to normal.                  
  If you do need the{doctor}you have to
 go to Orleton,Kingsland or Leominster.
 In Leominster there is a cottage      
{hospital}, if there is any major      
 illness you have to go to the County  
 or General Hospital in Hereford.      
  To be a district nurse you have to   
 pass a qualification or exam.The      
 district nurse is also for Eyton,     
 Leominster and Yarpole as well as     
 Luston.The school children have       
 regular check ups on their sight,     
 hearing,teeth,heads,hands and their   
 development by doctors and health     
 workers.The{physiotherapist}helps     
 children who have been referred to her</content>
