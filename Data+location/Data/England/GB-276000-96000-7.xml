 cost Â£100 to build. It was built in   
 1901 and is made of brick. There are  
 32 benches in the{chapel,}so there is 
 plenty of room.The{chapel}has suffered
 only minor damages, such as a broken  
 window.They have both a piano and an  
 organ so they can play all the songs  
 and hymns they want.Quite a few years 
 ago there was a flood around the      
{chapel}in the middle of a service.    
 Someone rushed in and told everybody  
 and then everybody rushed out. They   
 do not have a bell in the{chapel      
 but bells are expensive. There were no
 other buildings before the{chapel}    
 but the Christians used to meet in the
 house of a kind person.               </content>
