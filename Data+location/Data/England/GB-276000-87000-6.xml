		<content> The caravan site provides a good range
 of facilities including a swimming    
 pool and small zoo.  It is situated on
 the river Teign, has spaces for eighty
 tents and caravans, and is popular for
 its scenic surroundings, isolation,and
 easy accessibility to the Dartmoor    
 National Park.  Fishing is permitted  
 by licence obtainable from the Fingle 
 Bridge Park Information Centre.Many of
 the campers and caravaners return each
 year,and despite the poor weather of  
 the summer of 1985,the site was fairly
 full during August although the       
 weather deterred many possible campers
 with tents.  Apart from the site      
 owners, there are less than six other 
 permanent residents, most of whom have
 moved there from other parts of       
 Britain.  They live in houses mostly  
 converted from some of the farm       
 buildings.  Only one is a Devonian.   </content>
