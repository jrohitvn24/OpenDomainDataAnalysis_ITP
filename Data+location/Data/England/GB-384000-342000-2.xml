		<content>The Sentinel is our local newspaper.The
main offices are in Hanley.A Sentinel  
reporter came to our school to talk    
about his work.He brought photographs  
of famous people who had visited our   
area.He also showed us a negative of   
tomorrow's paper!                      
  In the Sentinel Thursday July 11th   
1985 the headline was,No!Stoke's Asda  
lifeline gets the boot.The article is  
about plans for an Asda superstore to  
be built at the local football ground. 
The store would have provided many jobs
and helped Stoke City's money problems.
  City councillors rejected the plans. 
Just before the meeting members of the 
Stoke Supporters Club gave in a        
petition of 33,000 names to the town   
hall.                                  
  Asda is still fighting for a         
superstore in Stoke.
