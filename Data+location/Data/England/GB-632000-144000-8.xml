		<title>08GUSTON VILLAGE AND SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The settlement predates the Survey of 
 1086 in which it appeared as Gocistone
 a derivation of the earlier "Guosiges 
 farmstead." There is now 1 church,1   
 pub,1 farmhouse,64 post war houses,15 
 older houses and numerous barns,      
 garages and sheds. The loss of the    
 village school and shop has led to a  
 feeling of neglect amongst villagers. 
 The school closed in 1981,it is now   
 moved to newer buildings in the       
 barracks 2kms away. Some parents      
 choose to take their children across  
 to St Margarets at Cliffe. Other      
 youngsters join the secondary pupils  
 for the journey down into Dover       
 usually by car. The closure of the    
 shop in 1981 was another blow to the  
 community. 9 out of 10 people now     
 drive into Dover to shop whilst the   
 others shop near their place of work. 
 32 cars were parked on a Saturday am. </content>
