		<title>17THE RAILWAY</title>
		<content>   A single track{railway}crosses the  
 area.There were stations at Constable 
 Burton and Finghall,but the former is 
 now derelict and the latter has been  
 converted into houses.                
                                       
   The line is no longer used for a    
 passenger service except for          
 occasional special trains,for example 
 for Christmas shopping.The line is,   
 however,still in use as a freight     
 service,daily trains carrying rock    
 from the quarry at Redmire.It is also 
 used to carry coal to the depot at    
 Leyburn.                              
                                       
   Constable Burton was the more       
 important station as it was the       
 passing place and had a cabin and 28  
 levers.These have gone leaving only   
 one signal and a derelict building to 
 mark former glories.                  </content>
