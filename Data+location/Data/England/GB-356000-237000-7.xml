		<title>07MORDIFORD CHURCH</title>
		<content>   There is a single church within the 
 D-Block situated in the village of    
 Mordiford. A single service is held   
 every Sunday by the vicar although    
 additional services are conducted on  
 Christmas Day, Good Friday and Easter 
 Day. The church enjoys a regular      
 attendance at these services but it is
 regarded by most only as a place to be
 Christened,married and buried in.     
   The Rev. McDonald has been priest   
 in charge for 15 years but is now     
 retiring and it is not known as yet   
 who will take his place.              
   The choir is made up primarily of   
 adults although a number of children  
 are also members. It is said to be    
 very good.                            
   The parishioners are involved with  
 the Church in many ways including     
 meetings of the P.C.C., fetes and     
 sales in aid of Church Funds.         </content>
