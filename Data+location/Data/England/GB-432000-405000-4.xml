 went to church every week.Out of 82   
 children in the junior classes,21 go  
 to church or Sunday school once a     
 week.Four go with one or more of their
 parents.No one went twice a week.Which

 minutes,3 said it was more than 2 but 
 less than 5 miles.15 people walked ,5 
 went by car and 1 walked.
