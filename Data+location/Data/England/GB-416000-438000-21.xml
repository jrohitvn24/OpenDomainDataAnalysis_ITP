Not much has changed since 1986. Many new houses built but the proposed by-pass road was cancelled.Modern electric trains run on the railway and pleasure craft still sail along the canal.Many of the shops have changed but the newsagents and the three pubs are still serving their customers.The speed limit along the main road was recently reduced to 30mph.   &lt;br />
