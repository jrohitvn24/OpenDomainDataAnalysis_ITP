 All school children from Bicker need  
 to travel into the next village of    
 Donington,for Bicker school was closed
 in 1964 and is now used for storing   
 fertilizers.                          
                                       
 When the school closed , children were
 promised free transport to Donington. 
 About 12 months ago an argument broke 
 out concerning this promise.          
                                       
 A protest march took place but to no  
 avail and parents have to pay to send 
 their children to school.             
 The fare is Â£4.00 per child per term. 
                                       
 The Donington schools are a primary   
 and secondary school.Those pupils who 
 pass the 11+ exam. have to travel into
 Boston to attend the Grammar school.  </content>
