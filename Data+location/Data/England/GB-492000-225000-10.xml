		<title>10BLACK HORSE PUB. L. BUZZARD</title>
		<content> The Black Horse, one of the oldest    
 pubs in Leighton Buzzard, stands by an
 extremely busy junction of the        
 Leighton Ring Road. The 17th century  
 pub in North Street closed in 1979 and
 re-opened again in February '81 and   
 once again established itself as      
 popular with the younger age group    
 18-30. The old barn behind the pub was
 under rennovation into housing        
 accomodation for the landlord when the
 pub and barn were badly burned in Oct 
 '84 and once again the pub was forced 
 to close. By January 1985 the pub's   
 thatched roof was restored to beauty  
 and the interior ready for re-opening.
 Now the barn is being restored again  
 but it is doubtful if it will be      
 thatched. Because of financial        
 constraints it is being restored with 
 a view to providing overnight         
 accomodation in the town.             </content>
