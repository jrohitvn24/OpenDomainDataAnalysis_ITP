		<title>14BROOMFIELD HOSPITAL I</title>
		<content>{ Broomfield Hospital}was built in the 
 1940's on the site which was owned by 
 the Nash family.The mansion which they
 lived in is now the nurses' residence.
 It was built as a{Tuberculosis        
{Hospital}and because of this there    
 were two south facing wings so that   
 the beds could be pushed out onto     
 verandahs for fresh air,as doctors    
 thought this would help the patients. 
    The Hospital used to grow their own
 vegetables for the patients and staff.
    In June-July 1983 the C.A.T.       
 Scanner was officially opened by      
{Princess Anne,}but it was running     
 twelve months before hand.It cost over
 one million pounds.The money for this 
 event was raised by the public and    
 some charities.The C.A.T. Scanner is  
 a large X-ray machine which examines  
 the whole of your body whilst rotating
 you round and round.                  </content>
