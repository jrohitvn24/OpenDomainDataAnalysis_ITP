		<content> The centre 6 squares of the survey    
 area form a Home Beat, known as Mill  
 Ward and St.James East Ward, policed  
 by the Bushey Police Station.  Bushey 
 is in the Barnet Division of the      
 Metropolitan Police Force. The police 
 contrast central London where         
 "travelling" crime is predominant with
 Bushey where 50% of the population    
 live in their own homes and           
 "residential" crime is a problem.     
 The most common offences commited in  
 the area include burglary (140 reports
 in 1984), criminal damage and vehical 
 crimes. 50% of the Beat constable's   
 arrests in 1984 involved teenagers in 
 crime but drug offences, drunkeness   
 and solvent abuse are rare. There are 
 no significant racial minorities in   
 the area but the large and growing    
 Jewish community is occasionally the  
 target for vandals.                   </content>
