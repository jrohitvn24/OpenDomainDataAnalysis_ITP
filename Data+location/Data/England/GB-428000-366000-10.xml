 during periods of snow. All the farms 
 are approximately 2 miles from a bus

 necessary. Refuse is collected fort-  
 nightly. Three farms have cesspools   
 and two have septic tanks. All have   
 electricity but no gas is available   
 except bottled gas. Four farms have a 
 daily newspaper delivered by the      
 postman and four use the mobile       
 library. Shopping is done in Matlock, 
 Chesterfield, Bakewell and Clay Cross.</content>
