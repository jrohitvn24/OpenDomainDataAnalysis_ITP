		<title>16ECOLOGY WELBURY &amp;DEIGHTON</title>
		<content> This gently undulating area lies 5    
 miles west of the Cleveland Hills and 
 is drained by the River Wiske. There  
 are several small ponds some occupying
 disused clay pits. Deighton &amp; Welbury 
 are on higher ground,the latter being 
 named because of its many springs &amp;   
 wells. There is little natural        
 vegetation;fields have hawthorn hedges
 broken by ash or oak.Green Lane is    
 popular in Welbury for collecting     
 brambles,sloes,damsons &amp; hazelnuts,   
 while children prefer Deighton        
 for"conkers"collected from horse-     
 chestnut trees bordering the          
 road.Deer,fox &amp; heron are occasionally
 seen.Pheasants are common game        
 birds.It is a cool windy area         
 affected by the North Sea.However it  
 is a green ,pleasant &amp; peaceful       
 environment,out of the pollution of   
 Teesside. .                           </content>
