		<content> Bentley Parish is very small and there
 was no sign post to the village. On   
 the very old maps you will find either
 Bentley Mill or Bentley Common but    
 Bentley as a parish did not exist     
 until 1953.Before that time it was    
 part of South Weald Parish. The mill  
 is shown on Chapman and Andre's map of
 Essex dated 1777. On the Ordnance     
 Survey map of 1881 the mill is marked 
 "wind and steam".The mill was pulled  
 down in l885.                         
 The school badge still has an emblem  
 of a windmill in gold.
