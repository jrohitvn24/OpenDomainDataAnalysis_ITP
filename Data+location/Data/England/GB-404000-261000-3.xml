		<title>03A WALK NEAR ASTWOOD BANK-2</title>
		<content> At the end of the field there is a    
 small stream which you have to cross, 
 but this soon disappears.In the       
 past,if a farmer had a stream in his  
 field, he would plant a hedge         
 along-side.                           
 You continue walking south and the    
 hills build up gently.You climb over a
 gate and walk along a mud track.This  
 soon finishes and you come to the     
 Saltway.This was a road going back to 
 Roman times,when Droitwich was an     
 important town for salt.Evesham,      
 Pershore and Worcester were all       
 market centres because of better      
 farming.We soon came to Sambourne.    
 Most of the woodland has been cut down
 in Sambourne to make space for        
 housing.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
