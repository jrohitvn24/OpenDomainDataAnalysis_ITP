		<content>  Entertainment within Longfield takes 
 place mainly in the home. For the     
 theatre,concerts,and films,residents  
 must go outside the area.             
 Ownership of televisions and          
 video-recorders is high,as is         
 ownership of radios, music-centres and
 computers. Many households have two   
 televisions and children often have a 
 portable television in their bedrooms.
 The Parent Teacher Associations of the
 three schools often organise          
 disco-dances and barn-dances;the      
 Hartley Country Club provides a venue 
 for sporting activities and relaxation
 afterwards in the bar. The public     
 houses provide the traditional focal  
 point for many residents.
