		<title>07Problems of open air theatre</title>
		<content> Being an open air theatre, the weather
 probably poses the greatest problem.  
 Therefore an alternative night system 
 was introduced in 1967. Transport is  
 as much of a problem- if the winds and
 tides are wrong, the boats cannot     
 travel, so the performances cannot    
 take place. If the tides become       
 dangerous during a performance, the   
 play may end early. Mosquitoes are    
 also a problem- the whole acting area 
 is sprayed with repelent half an hour 
 before every performance. Make-up also
 has to be applied twice as the        
 performance starts in daylight and    
 continues under artificial light, as  
 night falls. The actual lighting too  
 can pose problems, as being on an     
 island, the electricity supply is     
 limited. Voice projection is sometimes
 hampered by wind direction.
