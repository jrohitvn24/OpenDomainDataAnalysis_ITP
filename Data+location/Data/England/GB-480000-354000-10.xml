		<content>   The Jubilee Plantation is 2.7 acres 
 of land which became a {conservation} 
 area in 1977, Jubilee Year. Formerly a
 rubbish dump, Mr.&amp; Mrs.G.Page obtained
 permission from the Parish Council to 
 designate the land as a{Nature Reserve
   Many saplings of oak, wild cherry,  
 field maple, sycamore, whitebeam and  
 crab-apple planted seven years ago    
 survive today. Great-tits, sparrows,  
 yellow-hammers, whitethroats, wrens,  
 thrushes and blackbirds nest there.   
 The caterpillars of red admiral and   
 small tortoiseshell butterflies feed  
 on the nettles. Tufted vetch,         
 speedwell, shepherd's purse and       
 pepperwort grow freely.               
   Mr.&amp; Mrs.G.Page live next to the    
 plantation caring for sick and injured
 birds, many of which swim on the      
 Medieval moat, listed as an {Ancient  
{Monument}.                            </content>
