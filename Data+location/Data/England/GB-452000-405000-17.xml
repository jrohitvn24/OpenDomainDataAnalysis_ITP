		<content>    In their spare time many people    
 enjoy playing sports like squash,golf,
 tennis,football,snooker,cricket,darts,
 swimming,running and athletics,       
    Some sports are watched a lot on   
 the television which also gives us a  
 lot of our entertainment. We watch    
 things like cartoons,films,sports and 
 series. Small children tend to watch  
 cartoons about animals that can talk  
 and make believe like that. Older     
 children like adventure cartoons.     
    The most popular programmes are    
 detective stories and films. We watch 
 films about James Bond - a secret     
 agent, horror and war films. Many     
 people watch soap operas like Dallas  
 and Dynasty which are about the lives 
 of American millionaires, others watch
 things like Coronation Street and     
 Eastenders which are about the lives  
 of British people in certain areas.   </content>
