		<title>11Sports in Tiverton</title>
		<content> In Tiverton there are quite a few     
 sporting facilities:  Eight           
 Public Tennis Courts (+ 3 at School). 
 Swimming Pool.  Rugby pitches and     
 recreation grounds.  The local Rugby  
 team is quite good and plays teams    
 from all over the South West.  There  
 are two main Soccer teams: Tiverton   
 Town and Elmore, but there are lots of
 local league sides as well.  Football 
 is a very popular sport.  So is       
 cricket in the summer.  A lot of      
 people go angling on the Canal nearby.
  Others play squash at Blundell's     
 School.  The Tiverton Harriers        
 are the local athletics team.  There  
 is even a Rifle Club in the town.  Our
 only famous local sportsmen are Vic   
 Marks who plays cricket for Somerset  
 and England and Chris Maddocks a long 
 distance walker who was in the Los    
 Angeles Olympics.                     </content>
