		<title>06THE A340 - PANGBOURNE ROAD</title>
		<content> The A340 is the main north-south      
 access road in the area. It provides  
 people in villages like Pangbourne    
 with quick and easy access to the M4  
 and Reading. 295 vehicles went onto   
 the A340 from the roundabout. 195 had 
 come from the Theale by-pass, 10 from 
 Wigmore Lane, 68 from the             
 A4(Thatcham), 2 from the A4(Theale)   
 and 20 had gone once round the        
 roundabout. 245 had come from the     
 Theale by-pass, 9 from Wigmore Lane,  
 73 from the A4(Thatcham), 24 from the 
 A4(Theale) and 20 had gone once round 
 the roundabout. There is no obvious   
 reason why so many cars should go once
 round the roundabout, unless the      
 drivers had missed the ill-signposted 
 road to Bradfield.
