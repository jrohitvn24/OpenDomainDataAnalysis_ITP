		<title>10PADSTOW GIRL GUIDES</title>
		<content> Guides start at 7.00 p.m. on Monday   
 nights and finish at 9.00.We have     
 three patrols called Swallow,Chaffinch
 and Canary.When we arrive at the Guide
 Hut we walk smartly into a horseshoe  
 and our Guider collects our subs of   
 20p.Next we go to our Patrol Corner   
 where we have a Patrol Box and a      
 table.In the Box are paper and pencil 
 and Guide Books.We learn about the    
 Guide Laws and Promises (which are    
 hard to obey all the time) and find   
 out what we have to do for our badges.
 While we are doing this the Patrol    
 Leaders often go out and lay trails   
 for us to follow.Sometimes we play    
 games or have quizzes.At the end of   
 the meetings we sing songs before     
 going home.Guides are 75 years old    
 this year and there is an old lady    
 living in Padstow who was a member of 
 Padstow's first Guide Group.          </content>
