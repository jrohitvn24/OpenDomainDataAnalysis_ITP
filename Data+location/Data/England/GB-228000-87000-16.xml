 becomes                               
  { "Oh!'ers 'ad 'er 'air 'cut."       
                                       
  { "We are going to town"}becomes     
  { "Us be goin' to town"              
                                       
 Asking{"Where is it?"   }becomes      
       {"Where's it to?"               
                                       
 A farmer would say{"Cows 'av got wap" 
 meaning they are being tormented by   
 the Warble fly.

 be{"Drixie."

    {"Emmits."
