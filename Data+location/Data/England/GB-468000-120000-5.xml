		<content> The 1981 Census showed that in the    
 Enumeration Districts covering East   
 Meon and Langrish there was a total   
 population of about 1300.The sexes    
 were evenly balanced with slightly    
 more females.Of these,about half were 
 married.Approximately 25% of the      
 population consisted of children aged 
 under 16 and nearly as many - about   
 22% - were aged 60 or over,of whom    
 about 80 were retired males. The 2    
 biggest age groups were firstly       
 children aged 10-14,of whom there were
 about 125 and secondly the group of   
 adults aged 30-34,of whom there were  
 about 110.The numbers in the older age
 groups showed a general decline,apart 
 from the sudden and unexpected rise in
 numbers starting with the 50-54 age   
 group.This reflects the fact that this
 area is popular with people seking    
 somewhere to retire to.               </content>
