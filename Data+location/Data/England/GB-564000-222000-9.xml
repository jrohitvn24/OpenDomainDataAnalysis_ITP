		<title>09The Water Mill,Stebbing</title>
		<content> Town Mill was built in 1750 on the    
 site of a Saxon mill mentioned in the 
 Domesday Book.                        
  It is weather boarded with clay tile 
 roofing.{Still a working mill,}it     
 grinds oats,barley and beans for      
 animal feed,producing nearly 50 tons  
 per week,which is sold locally.       
   Since 1960 the mill has been run by 
 electricity,but the old machinery is  
 still used on special occasions.      
   The old wooden wheel was replaced in
 1877 by a cast-iron{pitch-back wheel} 
 which does not rust.There{are only two
{such wheels in Essex.}It measures 14ft
 8ins in diameter and is 8ft 4ins wide.
 It weighs 7 tons and turns at 6.25    
 R.P.M.when 25 to 30 tons of water pass
 through each minute.                  
  {The mill pond}was hand- made and the
 flood gates and flashes control       
 the level of water.                   </content>
