 With his partner he keeps l02{Dairy   
{Shorthorn cows}and three{bulls,}also  
 ll5{heifers}for replacements. He also 
 keeps a few hens and ducks.           
                                       
     Of the three{bulls,}only one      
 is a{Shorthorn,}the other two bulls   
 are crossing bulls, one{Red Holstein  
 for milk and the{Limousin}for beef.
