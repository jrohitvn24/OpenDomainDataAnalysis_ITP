		<title>10ROBSON'S FARM, HOPTON</title>
		<content> Robson's Farm is owned by Mr. Capon.  
 The farm is over 100 years old.  It   
 is quite a small farm with a few cows,
 calves, geese and chickens.  The farm 
 has 80 acres altogether.  The cows are
 milked twice a day and there is one   
 tank in the dairy.  In the morning the
 farmer's duty starts at about 6.30am. 
 and he mostly always feeds the animals
 before his breakfast.  The worst      
 trouble on the farm was the gales.    
 The farmer works on his own but his   
 son helps him sometimes.  On the farm 
 they grow oats, barley, sugar beet and
 grass for feed for the cows.  There   
 are two tractors.  Mr. Capon enjoys   
 his work on the farm.
