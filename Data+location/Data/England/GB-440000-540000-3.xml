 The council are allowing the building 
 of more houses to make{Peterlee       
 bigger. Most of them are being built  
 next to{Castle Eden Dene.             
                                       
 The{Chemical factory}that is close to 
 my house makes a horrible smell that  
 the wind sometimes carries over. At   
{Fisher_ Price}there was a{chemical    
{leakage}and a gas escaped. Six women  
 were taken to hospital for treatment. 
                                       
                                       
{Peterlee}could be improved by having  
 more swimming pools, that also are    
 cheaper, and more curcusses, fairs and
 carnivals. There should be more       
 playgrounds with a lot of swings and  
 more roundabouts, because the swings  
 are always full.
