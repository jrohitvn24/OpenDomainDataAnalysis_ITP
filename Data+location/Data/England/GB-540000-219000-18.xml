		<content>   The water table is high in the area 
 and in times past Much Hadham has been
 subjected to flooding.There are a     
 number of fords in the area but       
 several only have water flowing in    
 times of flood rather than genuine    
 fords. Extensive dredging has been    
 undertaken in 1985, and the flooding  
 problem has hopefully been alleviated.
   In the last two years there have    
 been cases of river pollution, which  
 on one occasion devastated the stocks 
 of trout at Gingercress Farm south of 
 the village.                          
   One of the fords marks the northerly
 boundary of the block at the hamlet of
 Hadham Ford where the River Ash       
 crosses the lane from Little Hadham to
 Much Hadham. Here, several attractive 
 houses line the edge of a small       
 sloping green, on which stands the war
 memorial.                             </content>
