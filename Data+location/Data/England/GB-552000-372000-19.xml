		<title>19Fiona Jackson's Saturday.</title>
		<content> On a Saturday when I wake up I lay in 
 bed for about 20 minutes thinking "I'm
 glad its not school".When I get up I  
 sit and watch television whilst eating
 my toast which I have for my          
 breakfast.Then I get dressed.Sometimes
 I take the dog a walk and sometimes I 
 clean up.I go up to Chapel Point beach
 and round the village centre with the 
 dog.Then we have a quick snack        
 lunch.After lunch I play with my      
 brother or sometimes I help my mum    
 with the pots and then sit down and   
 read.Sometimes i might go and play    
 with my freind.I play with Kay Winson 
 most of the time.We play Monopoly or  
 racing outside she wins because shes  
 older than me.When it gets dark I come
 in from playing."My mum says so".When 
 I come in I have a big cooked meal    
 then I watch television.I go to bed at
 9.00.,not cleaning my teeth.          </content>
