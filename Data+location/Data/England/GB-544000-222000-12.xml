		<title>12ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content>     Arable farming is far more        
 important than livestock in this area 
 primarily because of the favourable   
 climatic conditions for cereal crops  
 such as wheat and barley. Other       
 factors of importance are the gently  
 undulating landscape which allows     
 large machinery to be used and the    
 heavy clay soils which retain the low 
 rainfall in an area of permeable rock.
 Of the cereals barley is the most     
 important, large quantities are now   
 used for animal feed in addition to   
 the traditional use for malting. Other
 crops include potatoes, field beans   
 and increasingly rape seed. These are 
 used in rotation with the cereals and 
 like them are usually cash crops.     
 Potatoes are grown for local          
 consumption but some are marketed as  
 far away as Sweden. The good road     
 network helps long distance transport.</content>
