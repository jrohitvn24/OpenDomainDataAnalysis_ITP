		<title>11Housing situation in Thurlow</title>
		<content> Many houses are owned and maintained  
 by the estate, but others have been   
 sold privately as the estate need     
 fewer employees on the land. Now      
 estate houses are occupied by both    
 estate workers and also their grown up
 families. Little Thurlow has a few    
 Council Houses, controlled by St      
 Edmundsbury Borough Council, and      
 awarded as in the country by a points 
 system. Applications for new          
 buildings or alterations are passed   
 before the parish and borough         
 councils, who both take the           
 responsibility seriously, trying to   
 keep the harmonious appearance of the 
 area. There is no structure plan for  
 development here, unlike many nearby  
 villages. The village land is listed  
 and the environs of Thurlow are in a  
 conservation area, so any new building
 is limited to infill former sites.    </content>
