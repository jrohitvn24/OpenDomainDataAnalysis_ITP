  The local landowners provided the    
 original room in 1921 as a rest room  
 for Irishmen working in this country  
 picking potatoes on local farms.An    
 extension was built in 1926 at a cost 
 of Â£176-16s. It became the local      
 working mens' club in 1931 when the   
 Bar area was added costing Â£186-19s.  
 The present club is still situated on 
 land owned by The London Distillers   
 Public Limited Company but four       
 trustees are now responsible for it.  
 It is open seven evenings a week as a 
 club and is rented out to other       
 gatherings for daily or evening       
 use.The Local Ladies Guild meets once 
 a month and the Annual Village Flower 
 show is held there.
