		<content> A popular leisure time activity in the
 1980s is Martial Arts. This is        
 learning to defend yourself if you are
 attacked. The art is only used for    
 self-defence or to defend the weak. In
 the club you must wear a white suit   
 with a certain coloured belt which    
 signifies your grade or importance. We
 do sparring and patterns for different
 belts or grades. Sparring is where two
 people put on boxing gloves. You can  
 also wear feet guards and head guards 
 for extra protection. This is to      
 practise defending yourself in case   
 you are in a real fight. A pattern is 
 where one person does a sequence of   
 movements in attack and defence       
 against an imaginary opponent. The    
 club that I attend takes place on     
 Wednesdays and Fridays from 6.00p.m.  
 until 8.00p.m.                        
                                       </content>
