 Dean but are open to all.             
 The open air swimming pool at Eileen  
 Wade Lower School is provided by the  
 Education Authority but is open for   
 use to all members of the Parent      
 Teacher Association and all residents 
 of Upper and Lower Dean and Shelton.  
 It is open from May to September till 
 8pm (5pm on Sundays) and is looked    
 after by people in the village. It is 
 extremely well used in good weather.  
 The Sports Ground, formerly used by   
 the cricket and football clubs and the
 Young Farmers, by permission of the   
 tenant farmer, has now been bought for
 the village by the Dalton Trust.It    
 will now be available to all members  
 of the village. The Brownies have     
 already held their sports day there.  
 Young members of the cricket club also
 use it for coaching sessions.         </content>
