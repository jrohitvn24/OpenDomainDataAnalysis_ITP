		<title>19School Closures and Changes.</title>
		<content> The National School at West Stour     
 closed in 1927 and at East Stour in   
 1954.Kington Magna village school was 
 closed in 1968.The children were      
 transferred to Stour Provost.Able     
 pupils took the 11+ examination and   
 attended Gillingham Grammar,four miles
 away.On an adjoining site the         
 Secondary Modern opened in 1940.This  
 had its own smallholding and Rural    
 Science was taught.All children over  
 11 years left their villages in buses 
 for Gillingham.The two schools merged 
 in 1958 as Gillingham School but the  
 smallholding closed in 1982 as part of
 Government economies. In the near     
 future schools may well use the system
 of Continental Day to solve the       
 present conflict over responsibility  
 for children during lunchtime at      
 school.
