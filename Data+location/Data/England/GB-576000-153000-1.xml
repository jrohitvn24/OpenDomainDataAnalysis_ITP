 the town's major street intersection  
 at the{QUEEN'S MONUMENT}(761558) to   
 the separate village of{OTHAM}in sq.  
 7953. Housing varies from Victorian   
 terraces and newer tower blocks in sq.

 estate and private housing still being
 built at{GROVE GREEN, DOWNSWOOD}and   
{THE SPIRES.}These private developments
 including post-war estates in the     
{ROSEACRE}and{MADGINFORD}areas of      
{BEARSTED,}are separated from the core 
 of Maidstone by{MOTE PARK,}a protected
 public amenity of 2.5 sq.km.          
   To the North and South of this park 
 run two major, often congested, road
