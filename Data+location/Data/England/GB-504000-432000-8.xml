		<title>08  Orchard Park - Reality</title>
		<content> The spaceousness is a myth.  The      
 countryside is not readily accessible 
 to the suburban "towny".  The invasion
 of adjacent farmland by youthful      
 motorcyclists and even younger        
 children wanting to play in the hay at
 harvest time is not appreciated by the
 local farmers.  And a  well planned   
 adventure play park and mini-golf     
 course on the edge of the Estate seem 
 little used.  True the Barmston and   
 Beverley land drain that skirts the   
 eastern edge of the Estate is a rod   
 fisherman's haven and some young      
 people even swim there.  But sadly it 
 seems its greatest use is as a rubbish
 dump especially for supermarket       
 trolleys, old washers and cookers. The
 ordered ranks of pebble dash terraces 
 present a dull prospect at ground     
 level and only 20 years on the sub-   
 urban estate is fraying at the edges. </content>
