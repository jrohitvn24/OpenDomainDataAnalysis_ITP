		<title>13HIGHDOWN HILL cont.</title>
		<content>   People were attracted to Highsown by
 the {chalk gardens} , the views, the  
 garden's ponds, the open space, the   
 peace and quiet, the availability of  
 refreshment after a walk due to the   
 little cafe next to the garden.       
   Any changes that were commented on  
 were seen to be for the better, for   
 example the new cafe and the improved 
 gardens.                              
   Despite the tremendous amount of    
 people using Highdown, the amount of  
 abuse in terms of litter was very     
 small.  It seemed most people         
 respected the ground and treated it   
 well.                                 
   Other things of interest on the hill
 are the {Anglo-Saxon }burial ground,  
 Britain's first export commodity in   
 the {neolithic flint mines} and also  
 the {miller's tomb}.(See Ferring)
