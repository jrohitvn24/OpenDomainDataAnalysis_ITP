		<title>09 THORLEY NEEDS A HALL</title>
		<content>                                       
Thorley Manor Residents' Association,  
Bishop's Stortford,has asked East      
Herts.District Council to help finance 
the building of a community centre for 
the new 284 acre residential           
development.Two possible sites are     
near the Sainsbury shopping centre or  
close to the Harvest Moon public house 
at the former Piggott's Farm where     
land is now available.  There          
is,however,no money in the council     
community services capital spending    
for the next 5 years.Leaders of St.    
James the Great church,Thorley, which  
is outside the new built-up area could 
provide the necessary cash for a new   
hall to replace an old one beside the  
church but residents would prefer a    
hall where it could be easily reached  
by many people such as scouts,guides &amp; 
mother/toddler groups.                 </content>
