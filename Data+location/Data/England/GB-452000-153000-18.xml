		<content> We have many clubs in Hannington, all 
 of whom meet in the wooden village    
 hall, which they hire from the Village
 hall Committee. The W.I. meet monthly 
 with an average membership of 15. This
 is one of the first established W.I's,
 having been formed in 1918.           
 Our Playgroup called the 'Ten 0'clock

 12 children supervised by a PPA member
 &amp; a Mother-helper. This is for the two
 years to four years of age. The Keep- 
 Fit Class, is for both young &amp; mature,
 averages 8 members and meet weekly in 
 the evenings.
