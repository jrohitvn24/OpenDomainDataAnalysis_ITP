		<content> As our headteacher retires this year, 
 he is the focus of our attention. He  
 has lived most of his life in this    
 area and has been at Hallam Middle    
 School since 1966. He served in the   
 Royal Navy during  the war, as a      
 wireless operator, and was trained as 
 a teacher at the end of the war. He   
 took over at Hallam in 1966 after the 
 school had been open just 18 months   
 and has been here ever since. In that 
 time, the school grew so rapidly that 
 a separate First School had to be     
 built and the Middle School moved into
 their vacated premises. In 1978 there 
 were 16 classes in the Middle School, 
 with 4 classes accommodated in mobile 
 outbuildings. By 1985, the school has 
 shrunk to nine classes because of the 
 fall in birth rate.
