 People who live in the country are    
 usually some distance away from the   
 nearest place of entertainment. They  
 sometimes go by car to the nearest    
 town to see a film or a show but      
 more often they support the events    
 which happen in their own or a        
 neighbouring village hall. Different  
 groups put on events like socials and 
 discos. There is usually a branch of  
 the Women's Institute in a village and
 also a club for old people. The       
 village hall often has classes run by 
 the County Council in the winter.     
 The other main place for social       
 evenings is the village inn. In the   
 days when few people had cars everyone
 would go to their nearest public      
 house, but nowadays you meet people   
 from other places who have come out   
 for an evening in the country.        </content>
