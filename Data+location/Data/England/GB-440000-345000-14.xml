		<content> At the bottom of Marlpool housing     
 estate there is a disused railway     
 line. It is now used a a public       
 bridleway. The path is about 1000     
 metres long. They took the lines up   
 about 30 years ago. The trains ran    
 from the coal pit surface to Ilkeston 
 station. They used ponies to pull the 
 cages to the surface. The Coppice     
 restaurant near Marlpool was a pit    
 manager's house. Down near Osborne's  
 pond the pumping house used to stand. 
 Right down the footpath there's a     
 station under the bridge. The trains  
 they used were steam trains from      
 Nottinghamshire. The land that was    
 used for mining is now Shipley Park.  
 In Shipley Park there is a visitors   
 centre with a range of books and      
 displays by local children. Since it  
 was opened about 400 visitors have    
 been there.It is also a ranger station</content>
