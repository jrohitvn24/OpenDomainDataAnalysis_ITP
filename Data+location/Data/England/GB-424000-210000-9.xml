		<title>09'The Countryman' Magazine.</title>
		<content>BÂ£The Countryman' is a quarterly        
magazine edited in Burford by          
Christopher Hall.It is taken by 81000  
people.Articles are sent in about the  
countryside, animals, birds,           
flowers and different parts of         
Britain.Chris Hall sorts these out and 
selects suitable poems and             
illustrations for the magazine.The     
writers are usually different for each 
issue.The magazine is available in     
newsagents or by annual                
subscription.Few children or very      
young people take the magazine,but it  
retains its readership and copies are  
sent abroad.The business started in    
1927 and the copies are printed in     
Luton using photocomposition           
machinery. The format has changed in   
the last forty years,but Chris Hall    
thinks it will keep its present design 
during the next few years.             </content>
