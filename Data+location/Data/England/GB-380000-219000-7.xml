 auctioneering room he sells cows,pigs 
 sows,sheep and lambs.The busiest times

 he has to know the value of the       
 animals,what each farmer is looking   
 for,whether they have enough money to 
 buy what they are bidding for,and when
 a person is bidding eg.nods,winks or  
 other signs.The rest of the week he
