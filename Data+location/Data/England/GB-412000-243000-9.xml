		<title>09Machines on the Farm.</title>
		<content> There are many machines on the farm   
 and many attachments. These are some  
 of the more important ones.           
                                       
{Tractors.}                            
                                       
 Mr Price has six tractors. One is     
 thirty years old. It hasn't a cab for 
 the driver or a cover for the engine. 
 It is smaller than the new ones. The  
 modern ones are bigger, more powerful,
 and more comfortable. They have many  
 electical controls as well as         
 hydraulic and mechanical ones. The    
 tractor is the modern horse.          
                                       
{Attachments.}                         
                                       
 We saw a tractor with a double spike  
 at the front lifting large, round     
 bales of straw from a trailer onto a  
 stack.                                </content>
