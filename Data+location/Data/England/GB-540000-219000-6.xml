		<title>06The Parish Church part 3</title>
		<content>   On Tuesday May 14th. Class 4 of St. 
 Andrew's School visited the Parish    
 Church of St.Andrew, Much Hadham. We  
 are hoping to gather information about
 the church and to draw and make brass 
 rubbings, for our Domesday record.    
   A few brasses still remain in the   
 church and most of these are to the   
 Newce Family, who lived in Henry      
 V111's, Mary's and Elizabeth's time.  
 Interestingly, one of these Newces    
 seems to have embezzled church        
 property, in the shape of a bell.     
   The church building  is of flint    
 with stone dressing. The embattled    
 western tower with pinnacles and      
 spire,  houses a peal of eight bells  
 installed in 1950. (Six bells were    
 recast and two new bells added as part
 of Much Hadham's war memorial).The    
 peal was originally 5 bells,each bell 
 inscribed with the donators name.     </content>
