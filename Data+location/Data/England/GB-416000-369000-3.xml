		<content>{Monsal Dale }is sometimes called the  
 Queen of the Derbyshire Dales. The    
 River Wye flows through the dale which
 is famous for its wild flowers and the
 wild orchids. The Dale is well known  
 for the river birds which gather      
 there. Coots, ducks, dippers and      
 Kingfishers are commonly seen.        
 The Dale is crossed by the Monsal     
 Viaduct which carried the Midland     
 Railway  between Matlock and Buxton.  
 The Viaduct is 40 metres high, 100    
 metres long and has five arches.      
 The railway entered the Dale after    
 passing through the 540 metre long    
 Headstone Tunnel.                     
 The coming of the railway caused great
 controversy when it opened, but the   
 line closed in the 1960's and the     
 track bed forms the Monsal Trail      
 which is now used by walkers and      
 cyclists.                             </content>
