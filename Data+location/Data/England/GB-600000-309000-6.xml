		<title>06Farming in the Yaxham Area</title>
		<content>                                       
 The farming activity of this area is  
 truly 'mixed'.  Although there are a  
 number of farms which have an equal   
 balance of stock breeding, rearing and
 arable crops, most tend to specialize 
 to some degree.  At the present there 
 is considerable acreage devoted to    
 cereals, sugar beet and oil seed rape,
 but potatoes and smaller amounts of   
 strawberries and sweet corn can be    
 found. There is a large Dairy herd of 
 Freisian Cattle in Yaxham as well as  
 three farms with considerable pig     
 units involved in breeding and        
 fattening. Although many hedges have  
 been removed to increase acreage and  
 save work, and many elm trees have    
 been killed by the elm bark beetle    
 the area has been spared the bleak    
 'prairie' look by the retention of    
 some coverts and hedges.              </content>
