		<content>  In the infants we play tiggy &amp; sing  
 nursery rhymes but in the juniors we  
 have piggy back fights and play       
 bulldog, but it's banned now as it's  
 dangerous.                            
  To play streethawk you need a bike.  
 The goodie goes on the bike and tries 
 to catch the baddie who runs with a   
 100 second start.                     
  Mafia is a game played where one team
 makes up a code word and the other    
 team has to catch them and 'torture'  
 the code word out of them.            
  Another game is fireball. Everyone   
 stands in a circle and throws a ball  
 round. If someone drops it she runs   
 round the circle while the others     
 throw the ball around. If it gets back
 to her place before she does she's    
 out. In french skipping you sing a    
 special song while you jump. You also 
 sing songs while playing two-ball.    </content>
