		<content> There are no shops in Swineshead but  
 the village is well served by mobile  
 shops, there is a post office and a   
 pub. The centrepiece of the village is
 the church of St Nicholas. There has  
 been a church in Swineshead since the 
 12th century the present church being 
 completed in the 14th century. The    
 church is undergoing extensive        
 restoration at the moment and the     
 village is busy organising various    
 fund raising events to boost funds.   
 Over the last few centuries very      
 little development has taken place. In
 fact it is a smaller village in 1985  
 than it was 100 years ago. Quite a few
 of the cottages have disappeared and  
 the emphasis has changed from a       
 predominantly farming community to a  
 commuter village.                     
 Even so Swineshead still has a village
 spirit and a timeless feel about it.  </content>
