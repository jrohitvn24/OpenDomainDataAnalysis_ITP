		<title>07PETS IN THATCHAM.</title>
		<content>  A  survey was carried out when 363   
 children were interviewed about their 
 pets. We thought the most popular pet 
 was the dog then the cat, but we were 
 surprised to find the dog came first  
 then the{FISH!}with the cat coming    
 third. The most unusual pets were a   
 chameleon,lizard,tortoise and a horse.
 Rabbits were the next most popular pet
 then the birds then the rodents. We   
 asked a vet his opinion about buying  
 pets in a pet shop. He recommended    
 you should buy them from a breeder,   
 because the pets in the pet shops may 
 harbour more germs being caged        
 together. Some people buy their pets  
 from Animal Rescue societies.         
   Most dogs are taken for walks in    
 parks or fields. Many people get their
 pet food from a pet shop or Co-op, but
 some buy it from other places besides 
 the kennels.                          </content>
