		<title>11Portrait of a farm(NUMBER 3)</title>
		<content>This is Newbold Grounds Farm,in the    
N.of our block.Its 151 acres are almost
all in the block.It is all arable land.
This area was known as 'Little Wales'up
till 1946,because all the tenant       
farmers were Welsh.Cattle were         
transported from Mid Wales to be       
fattened here.(There was good grassland
based on the heavy clay soils,worn from
the underlying ironstone) After 1946,  
potatoes were no.1 crop but waterlogged
soils made harvesting difficult.Now the
accent is on wheat and barley,both sown
in Autumn.Peas,tic beans and oilseed   
rape are all grown for cattle feed.The 
tic beans are sent to a kibling mill,to
be 'kibbled'.Oilseed rape is quite a   
modern crop.It was once left to grow un
picked,for sheep to feed on, because it
was thought that the crop would not    
ripen in this country.
