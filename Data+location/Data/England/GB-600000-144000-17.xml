		<title>17 TRANSPORT IN KENNINGTON</title>
		<content> There are many bus services in        
 Kennington. All of them run through to
 Ashford. After a survey we conducted  
 on first year classes of the Towers,  
 we came to a decision that the bus    
 service is not very popular: the fare 
 is not reasonable, the buses are      
 dirty, but on the contrary to this it 
 is quite reliable and the drivers are 
 polite at times. The buses come every 
 hour. The numbers are as follows: 503 
 Towers View 505 William Harvey        
 Hospital, 666 Tritton Fields, 666     
 Faversham, 400 Canterbury. These buses
 vary from single and double deckers.  
 The bus station is in Station Road,   
 Ashford. Every bus comes hourly from 7
 am to 7pm. No buses run on a Sunday.  
 There are also taxi services which run
 to Kennington. The two taxi services  
 which cover Kennington are Arrow &amp;    
 Star. Most families own &amp; use a car.  </content>
