		<title>07Chaff Barn _ Eartham.</title>
		<content> The Chaff Barn is a small furniture   
 workshop in a converted barn. It was  
 opened in 1982 by Mr. Hankey, and he  
 works here with one other man making  
 quality furniture. The timber which he
 uses is all local and includes beech, 
 oak,elm and ash which he often buys   
 from the Forestry Commission as trees 
 then fells himself. The timber is then
 seasoned and kiln dried, with often as
 much as 50 gallons of moisture being  
 extracted from a 20 cubic foot load!  
 Within the workshop,Mr.Hankey has a   
 circular saw,a power plane and a      
 moulding machine.                     
 The furniture which he produces is    
 tables,dressers,cupboards and even    
 toys,usually after receiving special  
 orders rather than piling up stocks.  
 Examples of these are on show in what 
 was once the hay loft of the barn.
