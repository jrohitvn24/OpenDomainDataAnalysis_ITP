		<title>06The Beach in July</title>
		<content> Yesterday we went to the beach at     
 Jackson's Corner.We were asking people
 questions about what they thought of  
 Ingoldmells and where they came from. 
 Jackson's Corner is near the Lookout  
 with a restaurant.Towards Skegness on 
 the sands was an icecream van and a   
 man selling things to eat.For about 60
 metres the sand is soft where lots of 
 people sit in the sun.A bit further   
 down is a bank and wet sand where     
 no-one is sun bathing.The sea defences
 are strong.The steps stop some of the 
 waves in rough seas and the concrete  
 walls are curved and throw the waves  
 back.The breakwaters stop all the sand
 from washing away and leaving clay and
 stones.When we were walking along the 
 beach most of the children were       
 playing with balls and kites or       
 digging in the sand in front of the   
 dunes.                                </content>
