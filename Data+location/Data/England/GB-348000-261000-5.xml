		<content> In the morning I get dressed and go   
 downstairs and have my{breakfast}of   
 cereal,toast and a cup of tea.While I 
 am having my breakfast I listen to the
{radio.}Then my Mum{hoovers}the house  
 and dusts.Dad then uses a{telephone}to
 phone people up.My Mum makes dinner   
 on the{eletric cooker}.After dinner in
 the winter we light the log fire and  
 put the heaters on then we sit down   
 and watch{T.V.}While we are watching  
 T.V.{mum}makes tea which is           
 beefburgers,beans and chips.After I   
 have finished my tea I play a game    
 called monopoly until 9.00 p.m.Before 
 I go upstairs I have a drink of milk  
 which I get out of the{fridge}and I   
 also feed my{cat}.I then go and clean 
 my teeth and have a wash and go to the
 toilet in the bathroom.Then I go to   
 bed in my bedroom,read for half an    
 hour and then put out the light.      </content>
