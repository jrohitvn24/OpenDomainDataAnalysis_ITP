		<content> When they closed down the steelworks  
 ,I tried to get a job using the skills
 that I had there. I tried to get a job
 in a local hydraulics firm but there  
 were so many for interview that I was 
 unsuccessful. After five years of     
 being unemployed I decided to move out
 of the area. I got a job working for a
 building firm in Newcastle, twelve    
 miles away and had to travel there    
 each day. That job only lasted a few  
 months. Luckily my wife has opened a  
 shop of her own selling knitting wool.
 As business  seems to be doing well   
 she now employs two more women.       
    My daughter works in a local       
 factory as a machinist.{There seems to
{be more work for the women!           
    My son wanted to be a miner like   
 his grandad but{all the local mines   
{have been closed.                     
                                       </content>
