		<title>10Smarden - Transport</title>
		<content> A shortage of public transport for    
 people without cars or motor-cycles   
 causes real problems, especially in   
 emergencies or for young people       
 getting to work or college. Bicycles  
 are sometimes used for transport but  
 more often for leisure. Two buses a.m.
 and one p.m. go to Ashford daily, a   
 private bus to Maidstone on Tuesdays  
 and to Canterbury on Wednesdays.      
 Private car owners run a service to   
 Headcorn on Thursdays for shopping.   
 The main railway line runs through the
 area but the nearest stations are at  
 Headcorn and Pluckley, both about 3   
 miles from the village centre.        
 Transport of goods in over-large      
 vehicles trying to pass through the   
 village caused much concern, one      
 corner house being damaged almost     
 weekly until very heavy lorries were  
 prohibited.                           </content>
