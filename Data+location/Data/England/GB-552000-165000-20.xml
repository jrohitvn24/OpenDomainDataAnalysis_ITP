		<title>20RELIGION-EYNSFORD FARNINGHAM</title>
		<content>Our parish churches of Eynsford and    
Farningham share the same rector, the  
Rev.D.Sweetman. Parishioners enjoy     
family services, prayer, discussion and
a magazine. Anthony Roper school is    
lucky because Rev.Sweetman is their    
chairman of governors. He takes an     
active role in the school,takes        
assemblies and lends an ear to         
children and adults who want to talk   
to him. The minister from Eynsford     
Baptist Church also comes to our       
school. His church has activities for  
age groups throughout the week. A youth
club ends its activities with the      
minister speaking to them each Friday. 
There is a mid-week service, house     
groups meet for discussion and prayer. 
Services are informal, Sunday evening  
is a time for sharing of fellowship and
love.                                  
                                       </content>
