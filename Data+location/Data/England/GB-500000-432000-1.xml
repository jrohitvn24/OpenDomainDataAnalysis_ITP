		<title>01Cottingham and Skidby.</title>
		<content>  The area covered includes part of    
 Cottingham, the whole of the village  
 of Skidby and the tiny hamlet of      
 Risby.                                
                                       
  The part of Cottingham covered       
 contains a great deal of housing built
 in the last twenty years and part of a
 small estate of council housing.      
                                       
  The village of Skidby, nestling in a 
 dip in the Yorkshire Wolds, is very   
 pretty. Its most obvious feature is a 
 windmill, standing on a site where    
 there has been a mill for several     
 hundred years.                        
                                       
  Risby now consists of one farm but is
 shown on maps as a small hamlet. The  
 fields on either side of the farm     
 contain the earthworks of Risby Hall.
