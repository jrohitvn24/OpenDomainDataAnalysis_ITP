		<content> VERNON PARK-Nearly everyone in Basford
 uses Vernon Park in some way.Children 
 can play on the swings,roundabouts    
 &amp;the assult course.There is a large   
 pond &amp; some people fish there. Adults 
 can play cricket,tennis &amp; bowls or    
 just walk the dog &amp; sunbathe.         
 NORTHERN BATHS-There is also a        
 swimming pool on Vernon Rd. where     
 local people swim &amp;a successful       
 swimming club is based here.          
 CLUBS&amp;SOCIETIES-We can choose from    
 several clubs to go to in our spare   
 time &amp; this makes us luckier than the 
 adults who do not have much to do,    
 nearly all of them feel that there    
 could be more facilities.They can play
 darts or chat in a pub but must go out
 of the area for other amusements      
 outside the home.
