		<content> During a visit to the church of       
 St Mary the Virgin in Pillerton Hersey
 we discovered that the village used to
 be a Saxon settlement called          
 Pillhard.In the previous Domesday Book
 in was mentioned as Pillhardington.The
 word Hersey comes from Hugh,de        
 Hersey to whom the village was granted
 to him in 1193 by Richard 1.In        
 Pillerton Priors (Pillerton Hersey's  
 neighbouring village) there used to be
 a church dedicated to St Mary         
 Magdeline.In 1666 Prince Rupert burnt 
 the church down on his way to the     
 battle of Edgehill.The roof of the    
 nave was carved in the (15th          
 century.)The roof of the chancel has  
 hammer beams.There are three bells one
 was made in 1602,another in 1668 and  
 the last in 1672.
