		<title>06WILBERFOSS SPORTS CLUB</title>
		<content>    The sports club is one of the      
 centres of social life in the village.
 It sells the cheapest beer for miles  
 around and has excellent cricket and  
 football facilities. Each year Wilber-
 foss teams take part in local soccer, 
 cricket and darts leagues. A grounds- 
 man keeps the turf in good order. The 
 pavilion has changing rooms and       
 toilets in one part and has just had  
 an extension added.In the main bar    
 well upholstered seats surround a     
 central area complete with pool table 
 and dancing square. Dart boards and   
 "fruit machines"are provided. In      
 school holiday times films are often  
 shown for the benefit of the children.
   The best selling drink in the club  
 is bitter beer at 52p per pint and    
 the best selling snack is salted pea- 
 nuts. The pavilion has twice been     
 burgled and money and goods taken.    </content>
