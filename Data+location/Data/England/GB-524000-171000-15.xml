		<title>15The Wimbledon Championships</title>
		<content>The first reaction from people in many 
countries to "Wimbledon",is "ah yes,   
tennis".When the Championships begin,  
fans sleep out on the pavements near   
the courts,sometimes for several nights
in order to get good seats.They sit    
there looking very tired with hundreds 
of coke cans and other litter around.  
Along the queue,tickets touts wander.  
Buses and taxis crowd the road and     
every parking place for a mile around  
is full.Shops on the way to the courts,
and public transport, do good business.
Going in, the fans search the crowds,  
hoping to see a famous face from the   
glamorous tennis world. The outer      
grass courts are surrounded by so many 
people that it is almost impossible to 
move to find the game you want to      
watch.There is clapping and shouting   
on all sides and everyone looks happy.
