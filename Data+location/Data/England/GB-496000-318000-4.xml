		<content> The school is behind St.              
 James'church at the top of a steep    
 lane.There are 43 children in the     
 school at September 1985.There are two
 full time teachers and one part time  
 teacher.Children start school at four 
 + years and finish at 11+ .It has     
 one large junior playground and one   
 grassy orchard for the infants.The    
 school is built of stone and is quite 
 old.There are three classrooms.In the 
 junior classroom there is a hole in   
 the wall with a glass cover and inside
 it there are two coronation mugs      
 and two medals.There is also a bill   
 showing how much the local            
 celebrations cost.This is very faded  
 now.These things have been in the wall
 for 74 years for they are from        
 King George's and Queen Mary's        
 coronation. (1911)
