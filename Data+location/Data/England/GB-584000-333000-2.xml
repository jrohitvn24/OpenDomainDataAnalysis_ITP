		<content> The climate, and the nature of the    
 soil, have been major factors in the  
 development of the village, Hard      
 winters, prevailing East winds, low   
 rainfall, and light soil, have        
 combined to produce an arable economy.
 The effect of the removal of hedges   
 adjoining roads, has been an increase 
 in the chances of the village being   
 cut off by drifting snow.             
 For some years a conservation area,   
 the worst effects of development are  
 being controlled.                     
 Pollution is not a problem, except for
 straw and stubble burning.  However,  
 trout in the River Burn were killed by
 accidental spillage of agricultural   
 chemicals in 1984.                    
 Footpaths have gone; of more concern  
 to ramblers than to inhabitants; their
 original purpose of passage to church 
 and school, being no longer required. </content>
