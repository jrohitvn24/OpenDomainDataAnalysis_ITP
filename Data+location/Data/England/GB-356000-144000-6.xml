		<title>06QUARRYING AND CONSERVATION</title>
		<content> Stone has been quarried for centuries 
 on Mendip - at first for building but 
 now for road stone. {Dulcote Hill}was 
 being extensively quarried earlier in 
 the century and would have been       
 completely removed which would have   
 ruined an attractive view from Wells. 
 Eminent local geologist,{H E Balch,   
 campaigned for the hill to be saved   
 and the northern and western slopes   
 were retained although the height     
 the hill was reduced.  The quarry has 
 now closed and is used as a council   
 rubbish dump.                         
 Current conservation issues include   
 the work of the{Somerset Trust for    
{Nature Conservation}which has taken   
 over the overgrown cemetery in East   
 Wells. Controversially they have begun
 cutting down much of the vegetation.  
{Wells Golf Club}is expanding to l8    
 holes at the cost of local woodland.  </content>
