		<content> The survey of the North Nibley area   
 was made by third year pupils of      
 Rednock School,Dursley.Two classes,3D 
 and 3U used time in History and       
 Geography to prepare and conduct the  
 survey.This amounted to 3 hours a week
 but many gave more time.None of the   
 pupils live in Nibley and expeditions 
 in the school minibus proved to be    
 both essential and interesting.A day  
 at the shop;a morning on the farm;a   
 tour of the pub;interviewing residents
 at home:all proved to be valuable to  
 both interviewers and interviewees.One
 parent had been brought up in the     
 Black Horse and was able to highlight 
 the changes that have taken place in  
 the last 30 years.History,via the     
 survey,was being made and being       
 remade.To ALL who helped,especially   
 the people of Nibley,MANY THANKS.
