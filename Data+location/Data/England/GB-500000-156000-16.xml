		<content>{The sewage works.}On Wednesday 22nd   
 May we went to the sewage works in    
 Carters Lane. Mr Parrott showed us    
 around and told us the sewage from all
 our Woking drains comes to these works
 and is purified. The water that is    
 clean enough goes back into the river.
 The first job at the works is to      
 remove rags, wood, and large objects  
 which could damage the machinery. Grit
 and sand gets into the drains from    
 roads and gardens. As it can wear out 
 pumps very quickly it is removed,     
 washed, dredged, and buried. After    
 that the sewage flows into primary    
 sedimentation tanks where the solids  
 will settle to the bottom. The liquid 
 that is left over is taken to the     
 secondary treatment plant. Special    
 microbes are grown which feed on the  
 sewage. They destroy harmful germs and
 leave only water and gas.             </content>
