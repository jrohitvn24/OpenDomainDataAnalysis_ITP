		<title>19LOCAL ISSUES IN THE VILLAGES</title>
		<content>   The old village families regret the 
{ influx of town people}who do not     
 understand the ethos of village life  
 nor the country code!The loss of vill-
 age self-sufficiency and the coming   
 of "commuterland" is also mourned.    
   Another large concern is the{high   
{ cost of housing}which prevents the   
 young staying or moving in:the sale of
 Council houses is criticised.The lack 
 of a full social and age range is lead
 -ing to{dying communities}with bus    
 services and local shops put at risk. 
   There is concern at the removal and 
 spraying of{hedgerows}and their harm- 
 ful effect on flora and fauna and the 
 loss of ploughed-up{footpaths.        
   There is the problem of{dogs}barking
 and fouling in public places where    
 there is also increased litter.{Cars  
 going too fast and late at night are  
 condemned.One or two see{no problems. </content>
