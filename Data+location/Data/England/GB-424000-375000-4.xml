  Saturday is the main day for the     
{carnival}.It has a{fancy dress}and a  
 lot of side stalls in the afternoon.In
 the evening there is a{boat race}and  
{barbecue.}The fancy dress has a lot of
 age groups .Even some grown-ups dress 
 up.                                   
  After the prizes there is a{parade.  
 There was a large roundabout that     
 attracted a lot of people although one
 or two were sick on it.The boats in   
 the{boat race}are usually home-made   
 ones so some of them have to be       
 pushed. The winner got a bottle of    
 wine and so did the first girls       
 in.After this was the barbecue.       
  Hot-dogs were 25p,beefburgers were   
 30p and soup was 15p.There was pop    
 music as well.
