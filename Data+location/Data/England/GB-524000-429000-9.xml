		<content>      When Mr. Wray and Mrs. Wright    
 were young the village was made up of 
 a scattering of farms and a small     
 number of houses close to the Church  
 and the village pub. Everyone knew    
 everyone else - in fact, most people  
 were related to one another. This gave
 a strong sense of community spirit    
 that was totally classless.           
      It is this same quality which    
 makes the village so popular          
 today.Everyone may no longer know     
 everyone else, but there are many     
 opportunities to meet for those who   
 wish to do so. Some people believe the
 village has grown too large, but the  
 majority still feel that it has       
 managed to retain its friendly village
 atmosphere.                           
      Unfortunately services haven't   
 kept pace with development and this   
 makes a car essential for villagers.  </content>
