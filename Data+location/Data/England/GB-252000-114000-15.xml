		<title>15EMPLOYMENT AT BEAFORD</title>
		<content>   The main employment in Beaford      
 parish is of course farm work. Most of
 the 18 farms covered by the grid area 
 are family concerns, and very few farm
 workers outside the families are      
 employed. Of the electoral roll       
 population, 283 adults, about 15% work
 on the land. Beaford has a high       
 proportion of elderly and retired     
 people, perhaps 25%. Other employ-    
 ment in the village is limited. The   
 Garage, Post Office, the Beaford      
 Centre, School, Beaford House Hotel,  
 and the Pub can only account for some 
 20 full and part-time jobs. The       
 majority of workers have to travel to 
 work in nearby towns, using their own 
 transport, and cover a wide variety of
 jobs. Employment for married women is 
 very limited, and school leavers have 
 to search for jobs in the towns, and  
 find some means of transport as well. </content>
