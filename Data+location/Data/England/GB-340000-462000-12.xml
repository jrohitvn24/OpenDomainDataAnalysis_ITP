		<title>12Flooding in Morecambe</title>

 One night in February 1983 the sea    
came over the promenade and Morecambe  
was flooded. There was no sea wall up  
then and all the houses on our road    
were flooded except for our hotel. My  
uncle John came in the middle of the   
night to see if we were alright. We    
were all asleep but he woke us up by   
ringing the doorbell . He was wet from 
head to toe and he stayed for a bit    
then went home. In the morning some    
people had cars in their gardens. Lots 
of cars were ruined because of sea     
water in their engines and there was no
electricity. The next day the wind was 
still blowing and at high tide the sea 
was sending high waves over the        
promenade. A policeman was stopping    
cars going past Regent Road and he was 
getting soaked.                        
                                       </content>
