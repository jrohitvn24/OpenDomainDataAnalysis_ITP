		<title>16CONINGTON - EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> The only jobs in Conington are        
 agricultural and as there are only    
 three farms the majority of people    
 commute to local towns such as        
 Huntingdon and Cambridge.             
 The farms are basically arable but one
 farmer, Lilly, has a herd of Blanche  
 d'Aquitaine cattle and keeps sheep.   
 Another, Papworth, has a dozen long   
 horned cattle and  also keeps         
 chickens and geese. Farmer Wright's   
 farm is purely arable with just one   
 horse.                                
 Some of the occupations of the        
 commutors are: computer salesman, book
 shop owner, university lecturer,      
 college staff, head of a major        
 department store in Cambridge, doctor,
 pilot, navigator.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
