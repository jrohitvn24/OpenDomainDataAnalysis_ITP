		<content>Barry Tump.                            
Barry Tump is a very old hill.It is in 
a field which used to be a Roman burial
ground.It has a round slope,not much   
grass and some trees .People say there 
is a wall through the middle and a     
black ghost one side and white ghost   
the other and they have a battle every 
evening.There is a stone on it which   
shows its height above sea level.      
The cross.                             
   The  cross is on the village green. 
It looks old and has lots of moss and  
lichen.The people that survived        
smallpox put it up in 1873.It says:    
 In the name of the Father and of the  
Son and of the Holy Ghost,Amen.        
 THIS ANCIENT CROSS WAS RESTORED BY THE
INHABITANTS OF LEAFIELD AS A MEMORIAL  
OF THEIR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SCOURGE  
OF SMALLPOX.
