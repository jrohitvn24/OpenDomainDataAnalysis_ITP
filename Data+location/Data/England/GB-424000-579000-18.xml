		<title>18Children's Games</title>
		<content> A report based on a study of children 
 between the ages of 5 &amp; l2            
 (Traditional Games) are played, some  
 involving simple equipment like a ball
 or some rope. Boys enjoy sporting     
 games and girls enjoy hopscotch,      
 skipping, leap frog and "two bally".  
 Chants are used to enhance play.      
 Children also copy the exploits of    
 their television heroes. Not all      
 schools have a grassed area. Outside  
 school, parks and playing fields are  
 available. A lot of children play in  
 the streets. Bikes are popular and    
 boys would like to take them to school
 for play purposes. (Family Games) are 
 played at home. Some children read at 
 nights and some play on their         
 computers. Group games are very       
 common, usually, but not always,      
 children tend to play games which     
 get them into trouble.                </content>
