		<content>  There is a variety of Christian      
churches to be found in and around     
Southborough. Two of the largest are   
St.Thomas's and the united parish of   
St.Peter with Christ Church and        
St.Matthew, with three vicars.         
  There is one Methodist church, the   
only one remaining from a selection    
that once served the area. Several     
redundant chapels can be found in      
amongst the Victorian and Edwardian    
housing.                               
  A modern Roman Catholic church,      
St.Dunstan's, serves the surrounding   
area. One small Jehovah's Witness Hall 
is based in an old shop on London Road.
  Over the last 10 years congregations 
have been falling. Some churches have  
active youth groups but most seem to   
have support from the older age group. 
There are however no redundant churches
in the area.                           </content>
