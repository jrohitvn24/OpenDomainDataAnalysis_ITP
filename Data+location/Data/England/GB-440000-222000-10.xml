		<title>10Footpaths and Bridleways</title>
		<content> There are five marked footpaths, three
 of which are also bridleways (you can 
 take horses down a bridleway but not  
 down a footpath). One of the          
 bridleways is a 'Green Lane', formerly
 a 'Carters' Lane', along which the    
 cattle were taken to market without   
 having to go on the 'main' roads. Many
 footpaths lead to bridges, so that you
 can cross the rivers, and some,       
 including two new footpaths, lead to  
 the historic Hoar Stones in the       
 grounds of Barton Lodge. The new paths
 also link up the main A34 road with   
 Middle Barton village.                
 A local fieldpaths group helps to keep
 the paths clear and often walks them.
