		<content>Arable farming, characteristic of much 
of East Anglia, is the major land use  
locally. We found crops of Wheat,      
Barley, Sugar Beet, and some potatoes. 
There is some stock farming, a herd of 
Fresians is kept at the farm opposite  
the school gates. Many fields of hay   
were seen on our walks, providing      
winter feed, and some for conversion   
into silage one clamp of which we      
saw near Taylor's Grove above the      
village. Many of the Meadows near the  
flood plain of the Black Bourn were    
used for this purpose. We were         
especially fascinated by a bailer which
made large circular bales, as though it
was laying an egg!                     
Though a lot of hedges have disappeared
fortunately a number of local farmers  
have retained theirs, giving a rich    
source of wildlife, noticeable on walks
in the area.                           </content>
