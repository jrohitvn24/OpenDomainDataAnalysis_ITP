		<content>Feather's Caravan Site is situated on  
the north side of Whitley Bay.         
  The site was used as a P.O.W. camp in
the Second World War and then as a     
Territorial Army barracks before the   
caravan site was opened in 1960.       
  It is 13 hectares in size and has 525
caravans, some of which can house 8    
people. Prices range from 45-125 pounds
per week for hiring. 86% of visitors   
are local(within a 20 mile radius),out 
of approx. 20,000 visitors per year.   
The site is at its fullest during July 
and August, and at other times during  
school holidays.                       
  Facilities available on site include 
2 clubs, a swimming pool, an amusement 
arcade, a supermarket, a playground, a 
hairdresser, a laundrette, a chip shop,
a nurse and a bingo hall.
