		<title>12Entertainment in Rishton</title>

  The general opinion is that there is 
not much entertainment in Rishton. Most
people go out of the town for their    
entertainment.  Once a year there is a 
big fun day where there are stalls,    
music and other entertainment for all  
the family. This is well supported.    
  For young people there are youth     
clubs but for older people there are   
only pubs and clubs for entertainment. 
Most people stop at home and do such   
things as watching T.V. and doing      
crafts. Other people enjoy visiting    
their friends.                         
  There are a few spectator sports such
as bowls, football and netball, Clayton
Harriers and Rishton Cricket Club. The 
cricket club in Rishton has a very good
reputation.
