   Waitrose opens at 6.00 a.m. when the
 cleaners start they finish at 8.00 am 
   The goods are delivered to the store
 by the back door into the loading bay.
 Then they are taken in the lift to the
 warehouse where they are priced and   
 taken to the shop floor to be sold.   
   In the warehouse there are two      
 freezers,one for keeping all the      
 yoghurts and drinks in and the other  
 is for keeping frozen foods like peas 
 and chips in.                         
   Waitrose has 120 workers but many of
 them work part_time.The store has a   
 board to show which part of the store 
 sells the most.                       
   This was how they made it this week.
