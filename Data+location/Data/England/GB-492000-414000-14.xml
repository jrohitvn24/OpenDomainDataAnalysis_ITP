		<title>14STRAW BURNING-DISADVANTAGES</title>
		<content>    There are disadvantages for the    
 general oublic and in an attempt to   
 reduce these the{National Farmers     
{Union}issued a{straw burning code}    
 which was followed in 1984 by{model   
{by_laws}laid down by the{Home Office.}
 They were intended to reduce smoke and
 ash in the air, to minimise the hazard
 of smoke on the Highways and to curb  
 damage to the trees and hedge rows and
 wild life in them. Some of these      
 hazards were the result of careless   
 burning but many were caused by wind  
 change and flying sparks. The by-laws 
 carry a{maximum penalty of Â£2000}for  
 each offence.                         
    Burning of straw and stubble is    
 still legal but another method of     
 disposal now used is to{incorporate   
{the straw}into the soil immediately   
 after combining.
