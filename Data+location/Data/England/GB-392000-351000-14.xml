		<title>14Local Endon History.</title>
		<content>     In Saxon times Endon belonged to a
chieftain named Dunning and it was in  
the Kingdom of Mercia. In the original 
Domesday Book of 1086, Endon is called 
Enedun. (Heandun is the Anglo-Saxon for
"high hill"). It was described as      
wasteland.In the reign of Henry 111,the
village belonged to the Audley family  
and was part of the Manor of Horton. A 
manor house was built at the bottom of 
Park Lane but nothing is left now      
except the remains of the moat.        
     The name Stanley is derived from  
Stonelegh, meaning "stony ground." In  
1596, Sir Roland Stanley was Lord of   
the Manor.
