		<title>14    BIRTHDAY PARTIES.</title>
		<content>   An increasingly popular activity in 
 1985 is for junior{birthday parties}to
 be organised outside the home. Leisure
 Centres such as the one in{Cleethorpes
 now provide a very good service for   
 parents who are trying to protect     
 their homes from excited and sticky   
 children.                             
   When the leisure centre organises   
 the party, parents do not need to do  
 any work and there are many activities
 to take part in. Swimming is the most 
 popular activity which is usually     
 followed by a meal in the restaurant. 
   Parties are not always organised for
 the actual day of the childs birthday.
 For working parents Sundays are most  
 popular between 2 and 4 o clock.      
   Teenagers and adults can hire       
 equipment in the centre which is      
 becoming more popular together with   
 the trend for keeping fit.            </content>
