		<title>11TROON Cornwall - Climate</title>
		<content> The climate of the area is very much  
 dominated by Copper Hill and the high 
 ground to the south east.  The        
 prevailing wind is from the south     
 west, and TROON and its surrounding   
 area often suffers from being on the  
 weather side of the hill.  Four Lanes,
 just to the south east of the area, is
 often shrouded in mist and low cloud  
 for days at a time.  However the high 
 ground does help to protect the area  
 from cold easterly winds, and hard    
 frosts are virtually unknown.  In fact
 most of Cornwall has very mild        
 weather, being surrounded on three    
 sides by sea.
