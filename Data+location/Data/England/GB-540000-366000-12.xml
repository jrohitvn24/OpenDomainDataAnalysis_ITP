		<title>12CHANGES IN PARTNEY</title>
		<content> We intervieawed Miss Maddison         
 In Partney the roads have changed     
 a lot.Since Miss Maddison was young.  
 When she was little the roads were    
 very rough and people rode horses and 
 traps. She has lived in Partney all   
 her life except for a short time in   
 the War when she went to Spilsby with 
 her family.The church had 3 sevices   
 each Sunday at 8:00 to 12:00 and 6:00 
 Miss Maddison is a church warden.She  
 is responsible for the church and     
 every thing in it. Maddison Lane was  
 named after her farther because he    
 helped the council.When she was a     
 little girl the sheep fair was held 3 
 times a year and there were a lot less
 sheep. The village hall was built in  
 1920 and there were bakery shops an   
 ordinary shop and another pub.
