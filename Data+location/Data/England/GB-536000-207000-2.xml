		<content>{ The River Lea}used to provide a      
 means of transporting grain to London 
 but is now mainly used for recreation.
 It forms pt. ofthe Lea Valley Regional
 Park which provides a whole range of  
 recreational activities for the area. 
{ Hoddesdon}is an old market town and  
 was at one time a coaching station.   
 There are a variety of light          
 industries upon which the local area  
 is very dependent.                    
  To the east of the river, farming and
 nurseries have given way to sand and  
 gravel quarries which cover a large   
 part of the eastern area of the grid. 
 The nurseries still make a useful     
 contribution to the economy of the    
 area.                                 
 The urban population has increased    
 considerably during recent years      
 mainly because of industrial growth.  
 Many new housing estates now exist.   </content>
