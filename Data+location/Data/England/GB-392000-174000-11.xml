		<title>11 Langley Fitzurse School</title>
		<content>{ Langley Fitzurse School}is the       
 village school in Kington Langley,    
 taking its name from that of the      
 ecclesiastical parish.{Reginald       
{Fitzurse}was one of the knights       
 involved in the murder of Thomas a    
 Becket. For this deed Henry II who    
 was king of that time (1170) gave     
 him some land which is now Kington    
 Langley.                              
  As the school took its name from     
 Reginald Fitzurse, the school's       
 badge is Reginald's crest: three      
 bears' heads on a yellow background.  
  The school is built of Cotswold stone
 and the original buildings were       
 erected in 1856. Enlargments on the   
 school were done in 1969 and 1984.    
  The school has a main building with  
 two classrooms added and there is a   
 mobile as well. There are 90 pupils.
