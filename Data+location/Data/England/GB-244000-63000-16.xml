		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN BERE FERRERS.</title>
		<content>    From a fascinating past,when Bere  
 Ferrers Parish employed local men and 
 those impressed from Derbyshire mines 
 in its highly productive silver and   
 lead mining industry,Bere Ferrers has 
 now become the place of which the     
 local hotel proprietress said,"To stay
 here you've got to be self-employed - 
 that includes farm labourers".The farm
 labourers are now contract farmworkers
 -the farms being mainly family run .  
   Horticulture,which used to be a     
 wholesale market stopped because      
 labour was scarce and the railway     
 freight service was discontinued.The  
 early morning train carries employees 
 and other commuters to Plymouth.The   
 repair garage is family run.Other     
 self-employed people are a builder,   
 picture framer, market seller and     
 potter.There is also a hairdresser and
 a barber.                             </content>
