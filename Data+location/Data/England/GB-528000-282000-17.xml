		<title>17EDUCATION,THE COMMUNITY.</title>
		<content> The Community classes are run in the  
 youth centre which is next to the     
 school.There are classes for all ages 
 groups. The community centre was built
 in 1963,and the class es where started
 because the surrounding people wanted 
 the classes.Mr Ball runs all the      
 classes and joins in with some of them
 .Mr Ball has a lot of help from the   
 people who have school and the        
 teachers.The community classes are    
 mostly run in the evening,but a couple
 are run during the day for older      
 people.Most of the people who use  the
 community centre come for the         
 Ramsey/Bury area. There are a great   
 variety of classes offered both       
 practical and intellectual,physical   
 and spiritual.Despite increasing costs
 and educational cuts the Community    
 Centre thrives and provides a much    
 needed service to the area.           </content>
