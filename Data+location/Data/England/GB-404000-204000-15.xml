		<title>15INTERVIEW WITH A GARDENER</title>
		<content> We interviewed John Clark, who is the 
 gardener to Mrs D. Verey  who         
 owns Barnesley House and gardens open 
 to the public. It has a Tudor knot    
 garden and a medieval vegetable       
 garden.The gardener John works eight  
 hours a day. He starts work at 7.30 am
 and works till 3.30 pm.He lives in    
 Cirencester and he comes in his car to
 work. He has worked there all his     
 life. He said it is hard work in the  
 winter when it is snowy and frosty.   
 All the tools are supplied by the     
 owners. The Vereys have lived there   
 since 1939 and the garden was started 
 in 1960. Altogether the garden is 4   
 acres.It is very popular with visitors
 and tourists,and about 500 people go  
 there during the week about 1000 at   
 weekends in summer. The gardener has  
 to answer a lot of questions about the
 garden.                               </content>
