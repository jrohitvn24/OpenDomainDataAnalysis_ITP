		<title>20SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>   The{community}makes intensive use of
 the{school buildings}in our area.     
 Sunningmead First School,for example, 
 is used 3 times a week by a{dance     
{group.}The{Christian Fellowship}use   
 the school for study groups and       
 services, and{local retired people    
 come on Wednesdays for a{lunch club. }
   Staff at the school are glad that   
 the building is used for worthwhile   
 purposes and the headteacher is able  
 to use the{money}from{rental charges  
 to buy extra equipment for the school.
   All the groups are pleased to use a 
 warm, modern building, but the old    
 people are especially appreciative.   
 They enjoy the contact with the       
 younger generation and are pleased    
 that they do not have to walk far, or 
 wait for buses.{
