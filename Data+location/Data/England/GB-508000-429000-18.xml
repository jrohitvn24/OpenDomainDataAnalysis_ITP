		<title>18HULL'S TELEPHONE SYSTEM</title>
		<content>      The visitor to Hull will         
 immediately notice the difference in  
 the colour of the City's telephone    
 boxes.   All other parts of the       
 country may have red telephone boxes -
 in Hull they are a cream colour.   The
 reason is that the city maintains the 
 only privately owned telephone system 
 in the country.   Kingston upon Hull  
 City Council administers the system.  
      Subscribers have access to       
 British Telecom's services and        
 telephone network around the country  
 and at one time the cost of telephone 
 calls was thought to be cheaper than  
 within the old G.P.O. system.  Local  
 phone boxes are being fitted with the 
 most modern "push button" style       
 telephones.
