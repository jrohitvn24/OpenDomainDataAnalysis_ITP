		<title>05Park Top Farm</title>
		<content>  Mr. and Mrs Wallis own Park Top, the 
 actual farmhouse was built in the     
 nineteenth century.The farm consists  
 of 300 acres.They keep sheep and cows.
  Sheep is the main livestock, they    
 have 10 rams and 280 ewes,they keep   
 sheep for their wool, not their meat ,
 though about four or five lambs are   
 killed for meat for themselves.       
  They keep cows for milking .They have
 Freisians, Limousins, Charolais and   
 one Jersey cow and her calf. They use 
 modern machinery for the milking.They 
 have 30 bullocks, which they fatten   
 to sell at market. A good cow costs   
 Â£650.                                 
  They grow grass for hay and silage.  
 They have sold some land              
 to the army for a firing range (Feldom
 Range) and now rent it for grazing.   
  The Wallis' farm is mixed and quite  
 prosperous.                           </content>
