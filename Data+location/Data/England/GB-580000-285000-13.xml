		<title>13NATURE IN SANTON DOWNHAM (1)</title>
		<content> Since the block is in the heart of    
 Breckland, it has a climate unique to 
 the British Isles. It has a low       
 rainfall of 600mm per year, in        
 particular only 160mm between April   
 and September; Warmer summers and     
 colder winters than elsewhere with    
 frost recorded in every month of the  
 year. These figures are for 1960_64   
 and were recorded at Santon Downham.  
 The soil is generally sandy, with     
 flints on top of chalk and varies     
 considerably in thickness. Much of the
 sand arrived during great sandblows of
 the 17th century. The surrounding land
 then was sparse heathland with many   
 rabbit warrens and enough sand was    
 blown from Lakenheath Warren in 1668  
 to bury buildings and block the L.    
 Ouse at Santon.
