		<content> West End Green is a small, quiet      
 village on the outskirts of Stratfield
 Saye. There is one tiny village shop  
 that sells everything for the local   
 house owner. There are two rows of    
 houses in a small close. The          
 population is roughly one hundred. The
 whole village is surrounded by        
 picturesque countryside. There is one 
 lovely pub called "The Four           
 Horseshoes". Lovells farm is          
 approximately 150 yards from the      
 village shop. There is no local       
 transport but there are train and bus 
 routes in Bramley (a  nearby village).
 There is plenty of wildlife around {  
{WEST END GREEN }. Wild flowers grow   
 everywhere. There are a lot of wild   
 animals. If you like a quiet life in  
 an untouched village with character   
 this is the place to go.
