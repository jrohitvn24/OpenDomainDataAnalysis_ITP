		<title>05TOURISM IN HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> As people's holiday habits have       
 changed so the nature of Herne Bay's  
 tourist industry has also changed. No 
 longer do rows of boarding houses     
 cater for a vast influx of holiday    
 makers every summer. Certainly many   
 houses along the front do still cater 
 for the Bed and Breakfast holiday and 
 in many cases it is the older people  
 who would still stay at Herne Bay for 
 a quiet holiday. The bulk of the      
 holiday trade in 1985 would be from   
 fairly local people taking advantage  
 of the odd sunny day to visit the     
 beaches. Although the beaches are     
 stoney and the water is very shallow  
 when the tide is out  at least the    
 swimming is very safe and there are   
 two wooden diving boards for use at   
 high tide.
