		<content> The hall which is in a prominent      
 position was erected in memory to men 
 and women who died in the first world 
 war.It was opened in 1919 and has been
 the venue of all social               
 activities since.Following the        
 second world war a further tablet was 
 added showing the names of those      
 killed on active service. The hall has
 recently been extensively renovated   
 and is again fully used by            
 organisations in the village. A       
 committee consisting of               
 representatives of all the village    
 organisations meet each month .They   
 arrange some social event each month  
 as a fund raising effort .The village 
 band use it for practice and for      
 concerts. The womens institute meet   
 monthly and the friendly circle hold  
 meetings twice monthly.
