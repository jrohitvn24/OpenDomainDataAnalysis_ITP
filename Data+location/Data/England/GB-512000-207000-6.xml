		<content>  These have had a lot of criticism.   
 First was{Heritage Close,}built to    
 replace a department store.The cleared
 site made some people want a garden,  
 leading to the Abbey,but{15 shops}were
 built.We found{4 unlet,}few shoppers  
 and pessimistic shopkeepers, blaming  
 lack of parking and high overheads    
 for the poor business.                
  {The Maltings}opened in{1984,}has    
{16 shops}now and{53 coming,}but not   
 the department store most people had  
 hoped for and still want.{Shoppers }  
 wanted fewer fashion shops,they had   
 hardly any customers,and a large      
 supermarket.                          
{  Christopher Place}built in{1984}has 
{30 shops}and{17,}mostly fashion, are  
{open so far. Health and Beauty}has{400
{customers}a day.Others are not so     
 popular. Shoppers find car park       
 charges high and want a supermarket.  </content>
