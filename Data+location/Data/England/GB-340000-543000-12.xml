		<title>12LIFE STYLE - TRAVEL &amp; FAMILY</title>
		<content> 72% of families in our survey claimed 
 to go away from home for relaxation.  
 Apart from walking from home, other   
 activities required the means of      
 transport appropriate, be it car,     
 bicycle or bus.                       
                                       
 Some of our families enjoyed swimming,
 some visiting places of interest,     
 others enjoyed riding, music lessons, 
 attending church or Sunday School,    
 visiting relatives, shopping, and     
 attending Brownies.                   
                                       
 Possibly because of the expense of    
 travel, comparatively few families    
 managed to go away from their homes to
 relax each week. Most families managed
 at least once a month away, and some  
 only very irregularly.
