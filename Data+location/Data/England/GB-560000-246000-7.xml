		<title>07THE POSTMASTER</title>
		<content> The Post Office is owned by MR.and    
 MRS. LOXHAM. This a new venture for   
 them.MRS. LOXHAM used to be a teacher,
 and MR. LOXHAM used to be in          
 International Technical Recruitment   
 They obviously enjoy working together;
 when they embarked on this new        
 venture, they were told it would put  
 great strain on them as a married     
 couple and should not be entered into 
 lightly!  They have a very friendly   
 and helpful manner and are obviously  
 in the process of successfully        
 building up the business. The majority
 of the P.O. business consists of      
 dealing with pensions and benefits,   
 and handling the incoming and outgoing
 mail.They do not employ anyone, and   
 live behind the shop. The room above  
 the shop being used as a store room.
