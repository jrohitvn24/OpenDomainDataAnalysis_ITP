 My father has to get up for work and a
 little bit later I get up.My mother   
 and my sister are last.My father has  
 cornflakes and a cup of tea.I have a  
 fried breakfast and a drink from the  
 Sodastream,a machine that uses gas to 
 make fizzy drinks.My mother just has a
 bacon sandwich for breakfast.Then I   
 pack my bag for school.               
 After school I get changed and have   
 tea.Sometimes I read but other times I
 go out and play.My father gets home   
 from work at a quarter past five.Then 
 I stay with him until he goes to work 
 again at seven.My mother gets home    
 from her job at eight o'clock.At ten  
 o'clock I go to bed.
