		<title>07HITCHIN BY-PASS (1)</title>
		<content> Hitchin Priory By_pass, sometimes     
 called Tilehouse St. Relief road,     
 was opened to the public on Monday    
 December 7th 1981 at a cost of around 
 Â£2.5m. Work continued on the          
 roundabout at Tilehouse St., which    
 was finally opened to traffic on      
 Wednesday 7th April 1982. The By_pass 
 is just over half a mile long and     
 skirts the W.part of the town.It was  
 designed to relieve traffic congestion
 in the centre of Hitchin particularly 
 in the Tilehouse and Bridge St. areas 
 where it was believed traffic was     
 damaging several historical buildings.
 Tilehouse St. is Hitchin's oldest St. 
 and has been for centuries the resi_  
 dence of the town's leading people.   
 It was also thought that with a       
 By_pass built the old centre of       
 medieval Hitchin could once again     
 become an attractive area.            </content>
