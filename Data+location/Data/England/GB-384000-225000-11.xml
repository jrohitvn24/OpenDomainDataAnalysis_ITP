		<title>11         WAINLODE</title>
		<content>   Wainlode is an isolated hamlet lying
 at the foot of Wainlode Hill on the   
 east bank of the River Severn. There  
 is just a public house called the Red 
 Lion with a caravan site behind it and
 a couple  of farms called Hill Farm   
 and Green Farm.There are a few other  
 cottages which appear to be used as   
 holiday homes or weekend cottages for 
 people fishing along the River Severn.
 The houses are just above normal flood
 level but even so the narrow road     
 from Norton to Lower Apperley is often
 cut by floodwater in winter. The Red  
 Lion public house has a flood marker  
 on it showing exceptional flood       
 levels.                               
   The hill to the south of the hamlet 
 is covered in a mixture of coniferous 
 and deciduous woodland.
