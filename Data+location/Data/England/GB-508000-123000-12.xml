		<content> Employment in the district{(see also  
{p.11)}falls into 3 categories:{       
{service, agricultural &amp; light         
{industrial/engineering.}Estate agents,
 shops, banks &amp; offices employ mainly  
 female labour, often on a part-time   
 basis. Some women are involved in{    
{domestic}work and also{voluntary play 
{group}activities. Other service work  
 draws men to Horsham{(eg with the     
{insurance group Sun Alliance).}       
 Agricultural work is less dominant now
 because machinery usage has increased.
 A range of factories offers work for  
 men and women on research, production 
 (often assembly-line) and despatch.   
 There is one old-established tool     
 making firm, several light engineering
 works, a specialised chemical firm,two
 electronics firms, printers &amp; builders
 etc.{Apprenticeships}are dwindling and
 much factory work is temporary.       </content>
