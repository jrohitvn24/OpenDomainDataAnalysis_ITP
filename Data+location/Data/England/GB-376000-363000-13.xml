		<title>13Jayne Allens Weekend (cont).</title>
		<content> After dinner,the afternoon seemed to  
 go quite quickly.Dad replaced a       
 punctured wheel on his car and Mum did
 some washing and baking.We sat down to
 tea at about 5.30pm and ate chips,meat
 and cabbage,there was cake for seconds
 After washing-up we settled down to   
 watch television.But the dreaded      
 9.15pm came and I was sent to bed.    
     Sunday started in very much the   
 same way as Saturday.After breakfast I
 decided to watch the T.V.,I taped the 
 programme because my sister was       
 revising (as usual).I then went to    
 help Mum make lunch,I had sandwiches  
 and a yoghurt.The time seemed to fly  
 by,I did some housework then read for 
 a while.Later I tidied my bedroom     
 properly,which took quite a time      
 because it was a mess. Then I forced  
 myself to learn my Spellings until tea
 We watched TV until bedtime came again</content>
