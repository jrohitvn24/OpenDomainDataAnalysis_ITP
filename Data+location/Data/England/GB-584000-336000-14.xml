		<title>14TRANSPORT, NORTH CREAKE</title>
		<content> There is a dependence on private cars 
 for personal transport. The nearest   
 railway station is at Kings Lynn,     
 twenty four miles away. School buses  
 take infants to Burnham Market,       
 seniors to Wells, and students to the 
 Technical College at Kings Lynn.      
 Public transport has a Thursday bus to
 Fakenham, for market day.             
 Those without cars who need to shop in
 the County towns, rely on neighbours. 
 However, a community bus service      
 manned by volunteer drivers, has      
 started to operate.  If it is to      
 become established a large number of  
 amateur drives will have to be found, 
 to be trained to pass driving tests   
 for Public Service Vehicle licenses.  
 There is a taxi service, operating    
 from Fakenham.  The elderly without   
 cars are unable to afford the cost of 
 hiring such vehicle                   </content>
