		<content> The tourist potential of the line is  
 enormous. At nearly all times of the  
 year at weekends the trains which go  
 from Skipton and Settle to Appleby and
 Carlisle are crowded; in the summer   
 they are crowded every day as people  
 take advantage of the chance to see   
 the scenery of one of the most        
 spectacular railways in Britain. In   
 summer, too, steam trains ply the     
 line, and people come from far and    
 wide to watch and to photograph them. 
 The trains can be seen from the       
 windows of Settle High School, and    
 when a steam train passes there is    
 always great excitement. The line is  
 also used when there is a blockage on 
 the east or the west coast routes to  
 the North--and the viaduct still      
 holds!
