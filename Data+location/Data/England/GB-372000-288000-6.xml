		<content>{ Quatt}is a small linear village on   
 the A442. It was a{Roman settlement   
 which has not been really developed,  
 because it is on National Trust land, 
 where{development is limited.         
  The only notable event to have       
 occured at Quatt was during the 2nd   
 World War, when an RAF camp was there.
 As a result Quatt Cricket Club has    
 seen several famous cricketers, such  
 as{Cyril Washbrook.}The cricket pitch 
 is very small and is the only leisure 
 facility in Quatt.                    
  Nowadays Quatt is a residential area,
 where pensioners live. The only new   
 buildings are the water-works and     
 telephone exchange. The only other    
 buildings are a church, garage with a 
 village shop and sub-post office.There
 is one bus service although the main  
 transport is by car.Young people view 
 the village as{"boring".              </content>
