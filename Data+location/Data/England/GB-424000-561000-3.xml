		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN GATESHEAD</title>
		<content> (Old Fold is a district of Gateshead) 
   In Old Fold there are many people { 
{unemployed}as there are all over the  
 country. We asked St.Wilfrid's        
 children about the people in their    
 families. Of the ones that have jobs  
 the most common are{factory workers,  
{caretakers, welders and abbatoir      
{workers}for fathers and brothers and {
{barmaids, cleaners, shop assistants   
{and helpers in old peoples homes}for  
 mothers and sisters.                  
   Not many children or women can get  
 jobs at all. A lot of school leavers  
 try for a place on a {youth training  
{scheme }which lasts for 6 months or a 
 year.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
