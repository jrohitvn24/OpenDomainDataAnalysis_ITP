		<title>03SKEGNESS LIFEBOAT</title>
		<content> The{Skegness Lifeboat}is not an       
 ordinary Lifeboat because it has to be
 launched by tractor.Because{Skegness} 
 beach is flat the tide goes out along 
 way and therefore the{Lifeboat}can't  
 be launched down a slipway,it has to  
 be towed into the water by a special  
 sort of waterproof tractor.The name of
 the boat is{Charles Fredrick Grantham.
 There are eighteen crew men altogether
 which includes seven crew and eight   
 Land and Launch men,two tractor       
 drivers and one permanent man.{Ken    
{Holland}is the{Coxswain}of Skegness   
 Lifeboat.The most common accident is  
 inflateable airbeds and dinghies      
 drifting out to sea.Airbeds if found  
 are saved by the{Inshore Lifeboat.The 
{goverment does not help to pay any of 
{the money spent on the Lifeboat}and   
 equipment.The crew are not paid for   
 their work.They are all volunteers.   </content>
