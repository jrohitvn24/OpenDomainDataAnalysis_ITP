		<title>01Twyford &amp; Poundon Landscape</title>
		<content> Our block is a rural area.The main    
 village is{Twyford}population 550     
{ ,Poundon}90 people and small hamlet  
 of{Godington.}The land is used for    
 mixed farming i.e.animals and         
 cereals.The dominating skyline feature
 is{Calvert Brickworks chimneys}just   
 out of our block.The area's           
 accomodation is attracting an         
 increasing number of people who work  
 in nearby towns and cities.A few      
 people work as far away as London or  
 worldwide.We think our area is a      
 pleasant place to live with no        
 particular social problems,little     
 noise or heavy traffic i.e. no        
 airport,motorway or heavy industry    
 other than the brickworks which is not
 noisy but does cause some air         
 pollution from time to time.It is a   
 place where young and old can walk    
 without fear for their safety.        </content>
