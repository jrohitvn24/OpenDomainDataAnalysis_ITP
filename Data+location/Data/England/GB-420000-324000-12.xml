St.Johns Church is an Anglican church  
built in 1866.It cost 20 000 pounds to 
keep the church running last year.The  
9.15.am.Parish Family Mass is the most 
popular service.On Sunday about 300    
people go to the services and during   
the week up to 50 people go to the     
various other services.There are about 
3 Weddings and 5 Baptisms each month.  
The choir is all male and is made up   
of 14 boys and 8 men.Apart from 18     
weekly services the priest Father      
Jefferies takes Holy Communion to the  
sick, teaches the Christian faith,     
prays and helps people.This church has 
a large membership but Father          
Jefferies says, 'The church doesn't    
set out to be successful like a        
business, it sets out to be like Jesus 
and to show the love of God.'
