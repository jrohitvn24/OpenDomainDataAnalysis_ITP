		<title>05Living in an Oast House</title>
		<content> My family and I first came to live in 
 an oast house in 1982.It was once     
 owned by Whitbread.                   
 My dad has worked very hard turning it
 into a house.                         
 The roundel was used for drying the   
 hops to make beer.We now use the      
 roundel as our dining room and above  
 is my mum and dad's bedroom.          
 We still have the hop press in our    
 house which was used to hang a large  
 sack called a hop pocket.             
 In what is now our garage there are   
 dates and numbers stamped on the      
 beams.The numbers tell us how many hop
 pockets were in our oast each year.   
 When it was being used in 1930 there  
 were 384 hop pockets.                 
 I do like living in an oast house.    
 There's a lot of room.We have six     
 bedrooms,three bathrooms,a dining     
 room,a sitting room and large kitchen.</content>
