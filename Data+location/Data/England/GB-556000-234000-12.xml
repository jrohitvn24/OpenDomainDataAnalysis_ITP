		<content> This is known locally as the School   
 Green (grid ref:0559202355).It has    
 been used for play by the village     
 children for over 100 years.The County
 Primary School,built in 1876,is on the
 North side,whilst the original village
 school,now St.Pauls Chapel,is near the
 West side of the green.In front of the
 school wall is the village pump.This  
 was placed here a few feet from its   
 original site 10 years ago.Next to the
 pump is a barn like structure called  
 the Stable because the School Managers
 kept their horses in it when visiting 
 the school before motor cars.Now the  
 children use it for shelter in wet    
 weather.On the South and East sides   
 are a group of 7 trees(4 chestnut,3   
 flowering cherry)planted by the school
 children in National Tree Planting    
 Year 1973 when the slogan was"Plant a 
 tree in 73,plant some more in 74".    </content>
