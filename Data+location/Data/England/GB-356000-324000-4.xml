 Most  people in this area rely on     
 their own transport as there is little
 in the way of public services. Almost 
 all every day amenities are beyond    
 walking distance so peoplle without   
 cars rely on friends or neighbours or 
 on the local bus service.  For those  
 people in or near the village there   
 are three buses a day, a National Bus 
 Company service. For people in        
 outlying areas there is one bus a     
 week. No buses run on Sundays or after
 early evening.  There is a small rail 
 halt about seven miles away, although 
 the main line station twelve miles    
 away at Shrewsbury would probably be  
 reached as quickly.  There are no     
 petrol facilities within the area, and
 although the village boasts a car     
 repair workshop, it appears to be a   
 rather run down affair.               </content>
