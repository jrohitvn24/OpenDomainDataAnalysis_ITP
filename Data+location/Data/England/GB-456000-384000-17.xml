		<title>17GIRLS IN CARLTON IN THE '80S</title>
		<content> Girls should have more{equal}rights.A}
 lot of girls and boys,when asked,say  
 women should not be mechanics.I       
 disagree with them,they say women     
 shouldn't get dirty,and it's a man's  
 job which is wrong.If men think it is 
 too dirty for women to be mechanics   
 they are wrong because who changes the
 nappies of young children?{Women!Thats
 about the{dirtiest job I can think of.
 There are still some jobs which are   
 difficult to get or which women       
 aren't allowed to do.Most people say  
 women{should be able to do computer   
 work. Some boys say that girls should 
 not play certain sports like football 
 and cricket.They say yes but{not with 
 us.That is worse than saying no.Most  
 boys say girls are terrible at sport  
 if so thats because they don't get any
{practice.A lot of women give up hope.
