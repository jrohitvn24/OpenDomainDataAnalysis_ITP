		<content>    Morland had three main growth      
 periods. The first permanent stone    
 built houses and farms date from about
 1700 and were constructed of local    
 limestone and mortar with             
 "imported"sandstone for door and      
 window surrounds and slates for the   
 roof.Many of these buildings were     
 village farms that had a house,byre   
 and stable and a larger barn          
 attached.There are at least twelve of 
 these "in" farms remaining.           
    The second growth period was about 
 1950 when council houses were built.  
 The builders took great care to make  
 these fit into the traditional        
 pattern.                              
    During the past twenty years a     
 sewerage system was installed that    
 gave rise to a large number of mixed  
 dwellings being erected.The Council   
 have insisted they all fit the pattern</content>
