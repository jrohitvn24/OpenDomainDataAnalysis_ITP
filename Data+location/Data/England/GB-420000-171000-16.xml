		<title>16WOODLANDS DOWNLAND MINAL</title>
		<content> The planted woodland consists mainly  
 of windbreaks, which are largely      
 beech, but there ia a coniferous one  
 in  an exposed hill-top position. New 
 planting in the hedgerows is English  
 ash and wild cherry, almost certainly 
 used to replace the elms lost through 
 Dutch elm disease. By Thicketts Road  
 is a whitebeam plantation, and there  
 is a large area of ash -planted by    
 Dean Lane.  On the northern edge of   
 the sector studied there is an area of
 managed woodland, and this appears to 
 be for pheasant rearing rather than   
 for foorestry purposes. Stands of ash 
 and beech, interspersed with conifers,
 soar above the old coppiced hazel     
 which provides ground cover for the   
 game.
