		<title>05THE U.T.S.C. BOURNE END</title>
		<content>Some well-known riparian owners founded
the Upper Thames S.C. in 1884.The      
clubhouse soon became too small ,so    
the present clubhouse was built in     
1890,along a stretch of river long     
recognised as an attractive boating    
and sailing reach. Prospective members 
are interviewed and must own a boat.   
Presently there are about 340 members, 
including non sailing members.Members  
can leave their boats at the club by   
paying a mooring fee.About 90 boats    
form 6 different classes,which enter   
4 leagues annually, called series.They 
race for series points every Sunday,   
eventually competing for a trophy.     
During the annual 'Bourne End Week',   
members and visitors race for 15       
different cups,one of which is the     
'Queens Cup',presented by Queen        
Victoria.On Saturdays teaching classes 
help less experienced racers.          </content>
