		<title>04OLD AND NEW CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content>    Games have changed since 1945      
 except one of the most popular games  
 in those days,{Hopscotch,}which we    
 still play now. Some of the other     
 games which we don't play now were    
{Whip and Top, Checks, Blocks and Shine
{-a-light.}To play{Checks}you had to   
 mark circles on the ground with scores
 in them then you would throw coloured 
 discs into the circles, whoever got   
 the highest score won. They didn't use
 all the modern equipment we use now.  
 They used mostly sticks and stones .  
 Some of the most interesting games    
 were played by the boys such as{Hunch 
{Cuddy Hunch, Guinea Pig, Tin Can Spot,
{Run Sheep Run and Shine-a-light.}About
 three years ago{Christ Church School  
 started to play{Boule or Petanque,}a  
 French game which was first played in 
 Provence.We hold annual Singles and   
 Doubles Boule Championships in school.</content>
