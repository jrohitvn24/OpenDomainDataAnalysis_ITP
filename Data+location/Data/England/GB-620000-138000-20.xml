		<title>20Holywell Area</title>
		<content>  The majority of landcover in this    
 block is agricultural.However,the     
 section of land nearest to Folkestone 
 is open grassland with a series of    
 very steep hills and deep valleys.The 
 most well known of the valleys is     
 known as Holywell.                    
  Holywell has many trees,a stream runs
 along the bottom of the  valley and is
 very grassy. There are lots of wild   
 flowers including the Late Spider     
 Orchid                                
 There are many small wild animals     
 such as rabbits,stoats,voles and      
 mice.There are many birds and nests   
 everywhere.                           
  The surrounding hills are made of    
 chalk and are very difficult to       
 climb.When you get to the top you have
 a marvellous view of Folkestone and   
 the English Channel.The most well     
 known hill is Sugar Loaf Hill.   CR885</content>
