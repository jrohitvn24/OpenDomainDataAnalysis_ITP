		<title>12Bromley College</title>
		<content>Bromley College is one of the oldest   
buildings in Bromley being used for    
its original purpose.In 1666 Dr.John   
Warner,Bishop of Rochester died and    
left money to build a college"As good  
as hands could make it"to house twenty 
widows of Church of England Clergymen. 
Sir Christopher Wren is thought to     
have designed the four storey houses   
built,with a chapel,round a quadrangle.
Extensions were added in 1788 and 1821 
and the chapel has been built three    
times.In 1972 the houses were converted
into flats and a common room,laundry   
and shop were made.Retired Clergy and  
their wives or widows now live there.  
The college is administered by Trustees
who appoint a Chaplain as warden,a     
nurse and home helps to aid the members
.This is now sheltered accomodation and
continues the care begun by John Warner
320 years ago.                         </content>
