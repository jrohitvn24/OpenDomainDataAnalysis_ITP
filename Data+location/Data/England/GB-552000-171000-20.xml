		<title>20HAWLEY - GRAVEL PITS</title>
		<content>                                       
In the Hawley area a sand and gravel   
contractor excavates aggregate which   
is sorted and sold locally.  The firm  
has been established for about 60      
years.    As each excavation is        
completed the hole is filled in with   
rubble and refuse and eventually       
covered with top  soil, before being   
returned to agricultural use.    This  
process is interesting, especially for 
the conservationists. S.A.G.A. have    
given   awards for such schemes. The   
minerals for concrete production are   
available under the fields - they are  
needed for the building industry.      
Understanding between farmers and      
gravel workers has led to the speedy   
return of agricultural land once the   
gravel has been extracted. In Hawley   
an excellent example of this operation 
can be seen.                           </content>
