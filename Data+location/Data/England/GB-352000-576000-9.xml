		<content> In addition to the domestic animals   
 kept on the many farms, the area is   
 rich in wild animals. These range in  
 size downwards from the roe deer to   
 common fieldmice and shrews.The roe   
 deer live in the natural woodland to  
 be found bordering the rivers and in  
 the planted coniferous forests, but   
 they can frequently be seen crossing  
 roads , especially in the evening or  
 early in the morning.Limited numbers  
 are culled by the Forestry Game Warden
 to limit the amount of damage caused  
 to young trees.Next in size is the    
 fox, of which one or two inhabit this 
 area causing losses to the farmers of 
 poultry .Rabbits and hares are common 
 , and some say, increasing in         
 numbers.Hares live above ground making
 nests in long grass or rushes ,       
 rabbits have burrows in the dykes     
 (local name for field boundary).      </content>
