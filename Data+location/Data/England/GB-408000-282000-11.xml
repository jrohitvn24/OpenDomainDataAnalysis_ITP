		<content>We carried out a questionnaire survey  
into the recreational pursuits of      
famillies in our area. We discovered   
that:                                  
    watching T.V., listening to the    
radio and reading newspapers/books was 
carried on in most homes;              
    gardening was popular;             
    visiting the local park, library   
and swimming pool was very popular;    
    pop music was the favourite form   
of music listened to;                  
    few people rode a bicycle;         
    some people liked to visit the     
amusement arcade on the Stratford Road;
    half the people questionned went   
for a holiday away from Birmingham;    
    half the people interviewed had    
visited local museums/art galleries.   
                                       
    Recreation took place mainly in the
Home.                                  </content>
