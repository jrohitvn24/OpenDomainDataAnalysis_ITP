		<content> The Skipsea area is popular in summer 
 for holiday makers.Many people from   
 the West Riding have caravans on one  
 of the camps around here.The biggest  
 camp is the Far Grange camp owned by  
 the McCanns.It holds statics and has  
 room for touring vans.To attract the  
 visitors,the camp has a number of     
 attractions such as a clubhouse,a     
 shop,a games room and an arcade.The   
 sands at Skipsea are not as wide as in
 Bridlington Bay.The people who stay in
 the caravans often drive off for the  
 day to places of interest around, such
 as Bridlington.Some people go out on  
 the sea on boats or inflatables.During
 the summer months,the roads are very  
 busy with many more cars. Lots of     
 people drive through on their way to  
 look around Hornsea Pottery.          
 Withernsea is also popular,especially 
 on the market days. by Sam and Adrian.</content>
