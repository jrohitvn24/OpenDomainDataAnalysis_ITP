		<title>04THE ASLOCKTON PLAYGROUP</title>
		<content> The Aslockton playgroup has been going
 for 2 years now.The playgroup is on   
 Mondays,Wednesdays, and Friday.       
 They take 20 children, under 5 years  
 old, per day and they go on lots of   
 outings to farms,parks and they go on 
 walks.The children have lots of       
 activites like playing in the water   
 and sand and playing with             
 "playdoh".The children come from all  
 round the Whatton and Aslockton area  
 and some come from the Bottesford     
 area.  The playgroup meets in a spare 
 classroom in Aslockton school.  It is 
 privately run but watched over by the 
 church.
