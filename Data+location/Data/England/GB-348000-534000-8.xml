		<content> something with it so I listened to the
 radio instead.At 8:45 I put on my coat
 got my bag and went to school.When the
 bell rang,we sat down and Mrs         
 Tallontire marked the register. We    
 went into the hall to Assembly and    
 sang,"Oh Praise".Mr Clifford talked   
 .Then we said our prayers.After       
 Assembly we did spellings.After break 
 we did maths till dinnertime when we  
 had beefburgers, potatoes and         
 spaghetti and for pudding we had plums
 and custard.After break we did Singing
 Together.Then we went for a walk.I had
 to draw a picture of Boxwood House.   
 When we came back from the walk it was
 time for home.I went into the hall for
 Brownies.We sang the Brownie  song and
 then we went outside and played cat   
 and mouse.At 7:30 I went to bed.
