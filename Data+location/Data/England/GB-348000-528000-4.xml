		<title>04Castletown Week</title>
		<content> Castletown is an area of Penrith that 
 is a very close community, with a     
 great community spirit, that continues
 throughout the year,  but is shared   
 with everybody once a year in July it 
 is called "Castletown Week".  This    
 started at the end of the second world
 war, when Castletown decided to do    
 something to welcome home the soldiers
 at the end of the war. it was such a  
 sucess that it was decided to carry on
 until people were not interested, or  
 not enough people came forward to help
 with the great amount of organising   
 needed.  This has not happened and the
 annnual event is still going strong.  
 There are many different events each  
 day of "the week" which ends on a     
 Saturday with a great 'Gala Day'.     
 Great care is taken, because it is a  
 community that young and old alike are
 involved and enjoy themselves.        </content>
