		<content> Skirlaugh stands on fertile alluvial  
 soil which is excellent for arable and
 mixed farming. Our land cover survey  
 shows that the area around the village
 is mainly used for growing crops such 
 as grain, oil seed rape and           
 vegetables.                           
 Some animals are kept, especially pigs
 and there are supposed to be more pigs
 than people in the area. Most animals 
 are reared in indoor units but a few  
 cows and horses can be seen sometimes.
 About a hundred years ago nearly      
 everybody in the village would        
 probably have worked on a farm, now   
 hardly any do as so many jobs are done
 by machines.                          
 Many farms to day are made up of      
 several smaller farms and many of the 
 hedges and fences have been taken down
 to make it easier to use machinery.
