		<title>02HOUGHTON PARK_LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Houghton Park covers about 3 square   
 kilometres.I live at a cottage in the 
 park.There is an ancient wood in the  
 park called Kings Wood because{Henry  
{VIII}used to walk there .Houghton     
 House is a famous land mark in the    
 park.It was built in{1743,}but the    
 Duke of Bedford pulled the roof off   
 because he thought Woburn Abbey was   
 the prettiest house in all the        
 land.The farm cottages in Houghton    
 Park were built in{1950.}There is one 
 farm with 110 acres,2 small holdings  
 with 20 acres each.Living on top of   
 Ampthill hill is great,you can see for
 miles. Houghton Park is right on top  
 of Ampthill hill. Kingswood Cottage,  
 where I live,was built in{1843}and is 
 on the very top of the hill.
