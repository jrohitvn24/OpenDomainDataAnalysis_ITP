 many hundreds of acres of good farm   
 land.The main arable crops are        
 cereals,potatoes,peas,sugarbeet and   
 oil seed rape.Some fields are used to 
 grow Pick Your Own Fruits.There are   
 not many grazing animals here now but 
 most farms have pigs and chickens.    
 There are just a few horses,cows and  
 sheep.When the Bypass was being built 
 some fields were disturbed.It cut     
 through two belonging to Monkdown Farm
