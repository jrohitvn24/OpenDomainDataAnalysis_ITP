 You need about 10 to 20 people to play
 this game.All the players sit in a    
 circle.One player is picked to be     
 "It"."It" skips round the circle and  
 "tigs" or pats people on the head and 
 says "Duck". If "It" says "Goose" the 
 "Goose" has to chase "It" in and out  
 of the circle.You can change the      
 rules.                                
{War.                                  
 You need about four or more. You need 
 a toy gun or a stick. The game begins 
 when you make a barricade and hide    
 behind it. Then we all pretend to     
 shoot each other.If you are shot you  
 are not allowed to keep running. You  
 have to count to fifty before you are 
 allowed to join in again.
