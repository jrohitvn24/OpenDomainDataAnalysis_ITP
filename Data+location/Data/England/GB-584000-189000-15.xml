		<title>15Roads/pavements in Rochford.</title>
		<content> Rochford Town Centre is square.On     
 Tuesdays they have a market.Otherwise 
 it is used as a car park.We looked at 
 the street and the pavements.First of 
 all we looked at the ground,it was    
 quite uneven and the road was sloping 
 as well.The pavement was wide enough  
 for people  to walk on but in places  
 it was quite narrow.There were things 
 like bus stops, fruit displays, signs 
 that obstructed the pavement.The speed
 limit is 30 m.p.h on the road and     
 there are double yellow lines and     
 white lines. There aren't any pelican 
 crossings or zebra crossings.Cars can 
 only park when the market isn't there 
 and the only time when vehicles unload
 on the street is when the market is   
 there.There are signs for traffic     
 along the street,there are also       
 manholes and drain covers on the road 
 which is quite dangerous for cyclists.</content>
