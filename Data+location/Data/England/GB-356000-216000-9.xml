		<content> Our favourite games at school are     
 Cabbages,Polo,Free Denno, Quick Jack  
 and Eggy Peggy.                       
{Tag                                   
 One person is chosen to chase the     
 other people.When she succeeds in     
 touching one of the other players,the 
 game is repeated, with the person who 
 was touched chasing the others.       
{Cabbages}                             
 This game is a bit like tag.Each      
 person starts off with ten lives.One  
 person has to try and touch the other 
 people.If the person who has to touch 
 comes near then you shout "Cabbages", 
 and sit down.You then lose one life.  
 The game finishes when a person is    
 caught standing up or when somebody   
 loses all their lives.
