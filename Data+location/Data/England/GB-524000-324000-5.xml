		<content>{THE FUTURE FOOD PRODUCTION IN THE AREA
{______________________________________
    At the present time there is       
 surplus production of many types of   
 food grown in this area such as Wheat 
 and Potatoes. It is likely that there 
 will be a limit to the future increase
 of these crops and possibly even a    
 reduction. If this is the case then   
 the land currently used for growing   
 these crops will need to be used for  
 other things. In this part of the     
 country the land is too valuable and  
 fertile to be left fallow and so there
 is likely to be a search for new types
 of food crops to fill the gap caused. 
    It is not foreseen that the land in
 our area will be used for any         
 purpose other than agriculture. It is 
 one of the most fertile areas of the  
 country.
