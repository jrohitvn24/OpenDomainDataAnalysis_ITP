		<content> There are {Facilities} to help the {  
{Unemployed} in Heywood. There is a    
 D.H.S.S. Benefit Office and a Job     
 Centre in the town. There is also a   
 Drop-in Centre, specifically for young
 people, with expert help available. It
 is situated just under the {Careers   
{Office} where more help is at hand.   
 Although there are {Community Centres}
 in Heywood, at Darnhill and at Back O'
 the Moss,there are none in our        
 block,except  the Education and       
 Training Centre at Hind Hill Street,  
 the site of the Careers Office.       
 There are few {Entertainment          
{Facilities} available in Heywood.     
 Apart from the pubs, a few of which   
 have discos, most people travel to    
 Manchester, Bury or Rochdale. The town
 has fairly good {Sports Facilities,   
 but,apart from the cricket team, all  
 spectator sports are in Manchester.   </content>
