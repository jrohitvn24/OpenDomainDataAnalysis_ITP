		<title>01Braybrooke and Desborough</title>
		<content>The area covered by our survey is      
mainly open country with woodland      
confined to a few spinneys.The farms   
are increasingly concentrating on      
arable crops with the exception of the 
fields immediately surrounding         
Braybrooke which are down to permanent 
pasture.The 2 farmers concerned still  
continue the tradition of buying cattle
from hill farms mainly in Wales and    
fattening them for slaughter. The      
centres of population are the village  
of Braybrooke and part of the small    
town of Desborough.The road that       
connects the 2 was in ancient times the
main road to London and the area is    
crossed by the main railway from       
London to Derby and the north.To the   
east of Braybrooke lie the earthworks  
connected with the Medieval fishponds  
and the castle of Braybrooke of which  
there are no upstanding remains.       </content>
