 The basis of livestock rearing here is
 usually a flock of ewes, the number of
 which will often remain constant from 
 ,with losses due to old age, lambing, 
 and infertility, being made up from   
 the ewe lambs produced by the flock.  
 The flock must be{"dipped"}twice a    
 year against sheep scab etc.A police  
 officer must be present at the dip.   
{Lambing}takes place in early spring,  
 with the ewes kept in the open until a
 week or two before lambing starts.The 
 lambs are reared on the farm until the
 autumn when they will be sent to the  
{market,}usually at Melton Mowbray for 
 meat.The farmer receives a subsidy    
 from the govt. to top up the market   
 price A supplementary income is       
 gained in early June when the ewes    
 are{sheared.}The main breeds here are 
 Masham, Border-Leicester and Suffolks.</content>
