		<title>10VILLAGE FETE:DANE END &amp; AREA</title>
		<content> On the 15th June, 1985, the{annual    
{village fete,}at which all the local  
 clubs and organisations have a stall, 
 was held at{Little Munden}School.Canon
 Bennett, who used to be the Rector,   
 opened the fete. The school children  
 did country dancing, maypole dancing  
 and a Mummer's play.                  
{REPORT BY ADRIAN:}I met Andrew and    
 James by the Guide's stall. Andrew had
 a go  on the ladder stall and scored  
 830 which put him in pole position. We
 then went to the Youth Club sweet and 
 drink stall. I had a pineapple drink, 
 traffic light lolly and dracula fang  
 and then it was time to get ready for 
 the Mummer's play. The play didn't go 
 exactly to plan because I broke the   
 Turkish Knight's balsa wood sword     
 during a duel! A collection by the    
 children raised Â£20 for{Bangladesh
