 ==============                        
   The Women's Royal Voluntary Service 
 organise many services, one being     
 meals on wheels. the meals are        
 prepared at a local school and are    
 placed in individual containers which 
 are thn housed in a "Hot-Lock" which  
 is a galvanised container about 2'6"  
 square which is kept hot by charcoal  
 in a lower section of the container.  
 The meals are delivered twice a week  
 to elderly and infirm people,the      
 majority of whom live on their own.   
 There are an average of sixteen       
 drivers and helpers who call at their 
 houses, serve the meals and make sure 
 they are alright in every respect.    
 A lunch club is held once a week for  
 the more ambulant senior citizens     
 enabling them to meet each othe and   
 hae a meal together.                  </content>
