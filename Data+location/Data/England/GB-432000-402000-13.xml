		<title>13WORSBROUGH CANAL</title>
		<content>{Worsbrough Canal}was opened in{1804   
 and closed early this century.        
{Worbrough Reservoir}was built to      
 supply the canal with a constant      
 supply of water.The canal was part of 
 the{Dearne and Dove}system,most of the
 canal has now been filled in and has  
 been restored to farmland.Boats used  
 to go along the canal taking coal and 
 other goods to places such as         
 Manchester,Leeds and London.There is  
 only a short stretch of water left    
 now, about 60 metres long,but we can  
 tell that there was once a flourishing
 canal trade in the area because of the
 names of some of the public houses    
 along its course .There is the{Ship   
{Inn,Wharf}and the{Boatmans Rest}.In   
 summer time people go fishing and     
 swimming in what is left of the canal 
 this is known locally as the{"Cut"}   
 .                                     </content>
