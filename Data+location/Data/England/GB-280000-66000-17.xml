		<title>17Maypole Ipplepen Flower Show</title>
		<content>  When I was five I was an attendant to
 the Maypole Queen. She had 4 boys and 
 6 girls from my class to attend her.  
{The queen and Maypole Dancers'        
{procession started from the village   
{square at 2.00.}We walked behind the  
 brass band to the playing field. Then 
 we sat at the base of the maypole. The
 dancers walked to their ribbons. They 
 started to dance around and around,   
 they did the{Big Chain,}the{Cobweb}and
 other dances. The brass band played   
 the music.                            
  I had a lovely dress on. It was long 
 and white.{The boys and girls were all
{in white.}We carried posies of fresh  
 flowers. The maypole ribbons were red,
 yellow and blue.                      
  The maypole{dances were at 3.00 and  
{at 5.30.}They made a collection, I    
 don't remember what I had. This year  
 the dancers had Â£1.81 each.           </content>
