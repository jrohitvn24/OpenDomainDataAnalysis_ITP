		<title>18CHAIR MAKING</title>
		<content> For many years,Holcombe Rogus was a   
 most important centre for chair       
 making.I have decided to write about  
 this,not because it is still going on 
 but because there is hardly anything  
 written about it and I think that it  
 could easily be forgotten that this   
 industry ever existed.                
                                       
 Until the early years of this         
 century,this was all organised in     
 Holcombe Rogus as a Cottage Industry. 
                                       
 It was very well organised and        
 everybody had their own particular job
 to do.The chairs were stacked on the  
 verges outside the village as they    
 awaited the next stage of work.All of 
 the chairs for Exeter Cathedral were  
 made in Holcombe Rogus.
