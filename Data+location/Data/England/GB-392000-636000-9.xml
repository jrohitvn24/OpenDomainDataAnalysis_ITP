		<content>      FORD SCHOOL BUILDING.            
   There was a school in Ford many     
 years before the 1870 Education Act   
 and the first school was on the same  
 site as the present one.The walls of  
 the original building form parts of   
 some of the present walls and in the  
 school corridor there is an alcove in 
 one of walls which was a window in the
 first building.Later,the school was   
 transferred to another building in the
 village and the building became an    
 inn.When the inn moved out of the     
 village the building was enlarged and 
 about 1900 it became the Rectory.It   
 was used for this purpose until 1955  
 when a new rector felt it was too     
 large.The building was then converted 
 into a school and has been used as    
 such since 1957.
