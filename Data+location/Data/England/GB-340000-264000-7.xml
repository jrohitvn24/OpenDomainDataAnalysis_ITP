   There has been a Mill at Aymestrey  
 since at least the 10thC, the original
 Mill being mentioned in the Original  
 Doomesday Book. The present Mill dates
 back to the early 1800s and was       
 producing flour until the mid 1960s   
   Today the Mill is in a good state of
 repair and in working condition.      
   The old stables adjoining the Mill  
 have been converted into a{printmaking
{studio,}producing hand printed        
 lithographic limited editions for     
 artists. The Flat-bed{lithographic    
{press}is driven by gears, belts and   
 pulley wheels from the{water wheel.   
   In 1983 the present owner installed 
 a{Water Turbine}which generates       
 electricity for the heating and       
 lighting of the property which he     
 bought in 1974.
