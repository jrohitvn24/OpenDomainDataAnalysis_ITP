		<title>09FISHING IN SELSEY</title>
		<content>    Selsey has been famous as a fishing
 village for centuries.In the centre of
 East Beach are the fisherman's huts,  
 an untidy group of tar_pitched wooden 
 shacks,nets,lobster pots,small        
 punts.Some of the fishermen have      
 joined together to form a syndicate   
 and operate the larger boats which    
 ride at anchor opposite the huts      
 between February and November.The     
 fishermen mainly catch lobsters,prawns
 and crabs but also a variety of       
 different fish including skate,plaice 
 and mackerel sometimes.Winkles are    
 found in the sea area to the          
 North.They breed on the salt marsh and
 gradually move down. The best beds are
 just off_shore and this area is known 
 locally as the Winkle Beds.
