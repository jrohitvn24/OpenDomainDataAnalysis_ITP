		<content>   The area is rather flat, and slopes 
 gently to the coast and a large area  
 made up of many small islands and     
 extensive mud flats. The largest      
 island, Horsey Island, is private, and
 can be approached at low tide by a    
 causeway.                             
   This area contains the oldest       
 buildings in Kirby, many of them      
 dating from the 15th century.         
   There is a small boatyard and       
 launching area which used to be a     
 thriving quay before the river silted 
 up and motor transport became popular.
   One unusual feature is the free     
 supply of soft spring water to a      
 number of taps along the road.The     
 water comes from a spring on private  
 land.It was inaugurated by a local    
 landowner as a gift to the village.
