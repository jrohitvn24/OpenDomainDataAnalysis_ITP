		<content> In Repton a kind of monument was found
 in 1982. In this year, after 10 years 
 of excavation,{Professor Biddle}of    
 Oxford found a battle cemetery which  
 contained the bodies of over 150      
 Anglo-Saxons. The mound was discovered
 in the local vicarage garden.         
 A defensive ditch was also discovered 
 running through the church and        
 connecting to the Old Trent. This is  
 thought to be the site of the Viking  
 winter camp in 874-875 and the Church 
 itself is supposed to be the gateway  
 for the defenses. The mass burial is  
 thought to be the result of the defeat
 of the Mercian Army by the Vikings. In
 the Anglo-Saxon chronical it days "the
 Vikings came from Linsey to Repton and
 conquered the land"                   
 Near the church, St Wystan was        
 originally buried but was moved by    
 King Canute to Evesham.               </content>
