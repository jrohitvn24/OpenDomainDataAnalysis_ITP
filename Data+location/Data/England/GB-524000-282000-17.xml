		<title>17UPWOOD MANOR (PART 2)</title>
		<content> Mrs. Woodward's house used to be a    
 barn. It was covered in dirt. They    
 stripped it down to the wooden        
 structure and rebuilt it. It had a    
 small row of rooms built onto the     
 barn. No-one ever lived in the barn.  
 They used the row of rooms as a place 
 for trading animals. There was a fire 
 in the middle of the room and the     
 smoke went out of the roof. The beam  
 over the fire-place had three roses   
 carved out of the wood. There used to 
 be cows im the barn. There is a hole  
 in the garden. Mrs. Woodward puts     
 leaves in it but it sinks down. We    
 think it is the tunnel that leads to  
 the Methodist Church.
