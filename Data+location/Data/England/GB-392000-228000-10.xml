   The demand for 'local' shops selling
 convenience goods has declined even   
 though the population has risen.      
 People travel to Cheltenham,          
 Gloucester, and Tewkesbury for major  
 entertainments. Primary schools are   
 found in Bishops Cleeve, Treddington, 
 and Gotherington (all on the edge of  
 the survey area). Older children (aged
 11 to 18 years) attend the            
 comprehensive school in Bishops       
 Cleeve. Many children are taken to and
 from school by two local bus          
 companies; Perretts of Andoversford   
 and Marchants of Cheltenham. For many 
 children, having to catch the bus at  
 the end of the school day prevents    
 them from taking part in out of school
 activities.                           
      Public transport to the larger   
 villages is generally good.           </content>
