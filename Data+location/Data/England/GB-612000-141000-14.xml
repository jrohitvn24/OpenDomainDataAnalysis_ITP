		<title>14My Mum</title>
		<content> My name is Mark Ketchell. My Mum works
 at Sibton Park School and she is a    
 dinner lady. I live in Church Cottage.
 My Mum goes to work at 8.30am. When   
 she goes to work she asks the chef    
 what is for dinner so that she knows  
 what to put on the table. She lays the
 tables and serves the dinner. The     
 girls have dinner at 1pm and finish at
 about 2pm. Then they start work again.
 My Mum does the washing up. Sometimes 
 the machine breaks down and my Mum has
 to wash by hand, and that is hard     
 because there is lots of washing up.  
 Then she washes the pans and cleans   
 the kitchen. When she has finished she
 has her dinner. At about 3pm she goes 
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
