		<content> My name is Joan Oxberry and I am a    
 housewife.  At 7.50 a.m. I got up,    
 breakfasted with my husband George on 
 muesli and coffee and woke Amanda my  
 daughter and our spaniel Gwynne.      
 After making a feed for Kizzy, my     
 horse, I drove to the stable at       
 Hampton Fields, to groom her.  We rode
 past Gatcombe Farm and then I went    
 home to tidy the house.  I was ready  
 for my lunch of toasted cheese,       
 yoghurt and coffee.                   
 Then it was time for a walk with      
 Gwynne through the wet Cherington     
 Woods.  Kizzy had to be fed again and 
 I mucked her out.  For tea George had 
 bread and cheese and I had fish       
 fingers and baked beans.  We watched  
 television and I made hot chocolate.  
 Amanda showed us her costume for a    
 play and then at midnight it was      
 bedtime.                              </content>
