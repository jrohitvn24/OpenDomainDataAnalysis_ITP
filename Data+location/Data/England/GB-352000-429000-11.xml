		<title>11A LEISURE AREA IN PRESTON</title>
		<content>    People wanting some form of outdoor
 recreation can enjoy themselves in    
 different ways at the Deepdale leisure
 area between Watling St. Road and     
 Deepdale Road. The main feature is    
 cycling. There is a track where B.M.X.
 enthusiasts can race and perform      
 stunts. Children from 7 to teenage use
 the track and races are organised on  
 Sundays. The playground has three lots
 of swings, two roundabouts, climbing  
 frames, a slide and a helter-skelter. 
 Local mums bring their toddlers during
 the day and schoolchildren use it in  
 the evenings. There is also a nature  
 trail along the Eaves Brook, through  
 Happy Valley. You can see a lot of    
 different trees and plants and there  
 is a variety of bird species.
