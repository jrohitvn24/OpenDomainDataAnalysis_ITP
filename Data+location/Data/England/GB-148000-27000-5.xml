		<title>05LIVING ON ST.MICHAEL'S MOUNT</title>
		<content> The Mount is a very special place to  
 live. It is fun for children to have  
 friends to stay and children from the 
 mainland enjoy going there.           
                                       
 There are some disadvantages. The     
 children go to school in Marazion.    
 With care, a car or Landrover can be  
 driven across the narrow causeway at  
 low tide, but at high tide people have
 to cross by boat to the mainland.     
 There is an amphibious vehicle, or    
 "duck", for use when the sea has      
 covered the causeway but is too       
 shallow for a boat. In really bad     
 weather people can be stranded for    
 several days in Marazion or on the    
 Mount. This could be particularly     
 serious if someone was ill or injured 
 and needed medical help. In the winter
 the sea can come right up to the front
 doors of the cottages and flood them. </content>
