{  }Link was started 14 years ago in   
 1971. A committee of people from the  
 village are elected to operate the    
 scheme. Its purpose  is to help people
 who encounter difficulties in their   
 day to day lives.They act as'good     
 neighbours' by arranging transport for
 medical visits or collecting          
 prescription items from a chemist etc.
    Village people are asked every few 
 years if they will volunteer to help  
 run this village service on a rota    
 duty basis. Appointed Area Wardens    
 receive requests for help from needy  
 villagers ;they then approach a       
 volunteer to lend help in an          
 appropriate way.
