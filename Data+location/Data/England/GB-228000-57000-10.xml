		<content>  St.Ann's Church,Hessenford,was built 
 in 1832.It was taken down in 1870 and 
 rebuilt in 1871.Local stone was used. 
 Bath stone was used on the arches.This
 is crumbling.Long eared bats live in  
 the roof.It costs Â£40 a week to run   
 the church.                           
  The Methedist chapel was built in    
 1860.It's roof is in a poor state of  
 repair needing Â£2,000 to renew the    
 plaster on the walls and ceiling.The  
 committee have tried to claim         
 insurrance as the many heavy lorries  
 that passed while the building of a   
 large holiday complex caused much     
 vibration.The claim was not granted.  
 Â£100 has been raised so far.The chapel
 has little future.                    
  Widegates Methodist Church was built 
 in 1878,the Sunday School was added in
 1924
