		<title>07THE NEEDLES BATTERY</title>
		<content>  The Needles Battery is on the western
 point of the island overlooking the   
 Needles lighthouse.The Needles Battery
 was built in 1861-63,250ft above sea  
 level.The Battery which cost Â£6,958,  
 was designed by Major James Edwards,  
 Royal Engineers,and built by George   
 Smith of Pimlico, London .Mr.Smith    
 did not begin work until September    
 1861 by which time he should have     
 completed a third of the contract.In  
 1893 the new Needles Battery  was     
 built at the top of the ridge,where   
 the original Needles lighthouse had   
 stood until 1859. The chalk of the    
 Needles had proved too unstable to    
 withstand the concussion of the new   
 guns being installed to replace the   
 old 9in.
