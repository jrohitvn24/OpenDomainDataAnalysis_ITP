		<title>05Main Roads near Weston</title>
		<content> The A43 Oxford to Northampton road    
 skirts Weston and meets the A421      
 Bicester road at a round-about just   
 south of the village. Both roads are  
 extremely busy with local commuters   
 and long distance traffic heading     
 north to the M1 or south to the M40   
 and A34.  Race meetings at Silverstone
 cause extra congestion at weekends.   
                                       
 Although there is a 40 mph speed limit
 on the A43 at Weston, many accidents  
 occur and children and old people from
 the edges of the village feel cut off 
 because of the difficulties of walking
 or cycling along the road.  Car owners
 experience difficulty in crossing the 
 traffic. All the villagers questioned 
 considered the A43 dangerous and most 
 had witnessed accidents.  Residents   
 of Weston strongly support government 
 proposals to extend the M40 motorway. </content>
