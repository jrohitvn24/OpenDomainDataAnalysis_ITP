		<content> Every Monday from 6_ 0 clock till     
 8 _ o clock at the Methodist church   
 a group called Girls Brigade is held. 
 To open we  sing a hymn and say a     
 prayer .Then we split up into         
 explorers _ juniors and seniors .I am 
 in the juniors and over the last two  
 months I have been studying care of   
 pets,bible study and drill .Last night
 we had a get together and we had a    
 quiz and some skipping games .Then we 
 sat round a pretend camp fire and sang
 songs and after that we went into the 
 meeting room and Mrs Buroway gave us  
 some chocolate .Then we went home.I   
 enjoy going to girls brigade very     
 much.Also in the village for girls    
 tthere are Brownies,ballet and tap    
 dancing and for boys there are scouts,
 boys brigade and Wootton Rangers      
 Football Club and for boys and girl   
 there is explorers.                   </content>
