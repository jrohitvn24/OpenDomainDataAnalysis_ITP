		<title>12Dunton Village.</title>
		<content>   Dunton is built along part of the   
 Biggleswade to Cambridge road. It is a
 linear village. The High Street       
 hasfive cul-de-sacs leading from it,  
 and down one of these (Church Street) 
 is the only church.                   
   The church was built in 1499 and its
 organ was built in 1879. It holds many
 fund raising events for the           
 restoration and repair of the church. 
 The east windows were restored in     
 1959. The original windows had been   
 destroyed during the Reformation.     
   The local public house called The   
 March Hare was originally called The  
 Wheatsheaf and was one of five other  
 public houses in the village. Today   
 only one remains.                     
   In Chapel Street there was a chapel 
 but it is now a builders yard.
