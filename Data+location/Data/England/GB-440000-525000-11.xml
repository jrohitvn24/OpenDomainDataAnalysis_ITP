		<content>  THE TYPE OF FARMING FOUND IN AN AREA 
 DEPENDS ON THE CLIMATE, THE SOIL AND  
 THE RELIEF OF THE LAND.               
 IN THIS AREA OF TEESSIDE THE AVERAGE  
 NUMBER OF MONTHS A YEAR WITH A        
 TEMPERATURE OF MORE THAN 6 C (THE     
 MINIMUM FOR GROWTH), IS 6.8. THIS     
 MAKES ARABLE FARMING SUITABLE BECAUSE 
 THERE IS A LONG GROWING SEASON. THE   
 AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS OF SUNSHINE IS
 5.5 hrs A DAY. THIS MAKES ARABLE      
 FARMING EVEN MORE SUITABLE BECAUSE THE
 CROPS WILL RIPEN EASILY. THE AMOUNT OF
 RAIN FOR A YEAR IS 750mm WHICH IS GOOD
 FOR BARLEY AND RAPE BUT TOO MUCH FOR  
 WHEAT. THUS THE MAIN CROPS ARE RAPE   
 AND BARLEY. TWO OTHER REASONS FOR     
 THERE BEING MAINLY ARABLE CROPS IN    
 THIS AREA ARE THE GOOD SOIL (TILL)
