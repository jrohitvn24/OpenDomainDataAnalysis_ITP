		<title>02Mayfield's New Path</title>
		<content>In Mayfield we needed a new footpath   
because if you wanted to walk to Middle
 ayfield from school you had to walk   
partof the way on the road.The road is 
narrow and very busy,so it was highly  
dangerous.Staffordshire County Council 
paid for a new footpath.It took three  
months to complete and it is 1160      
metres long. A new post and rail fence 
has been built along part of the side  
of the path so that the farm animals   
are kept secure.Thorn bushes were      
planted too and Mr. Pinfold,a local    
inhabitant, has replaced some wild     
flowers along near the hedge.These     
include foxgloves,cornflowers,dog      
daises and vetch.The new path is very  
popular with those people who like to  
take a drink at the Rose and Crown,a   
pub in Middle Mayfield.
