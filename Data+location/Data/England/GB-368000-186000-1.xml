		<title>01Introduction, N. Rangeworthy</title>
		<content>{This area covers}the northern part of 
 Rangeworthy village and the hamlets of
 Bagstone and West End. The countryside
 consists almost entirely of flattish  
 grassland broken up by hedges, stone  
 walls and clumps of deciduous trees.  
 There is higher ground to the East as 
 you approach the Cotswold Hills.      
{Both Rangeworthy and Bagstone}are     
 rather linear in character running    
 alongside the Wotton Road with farms  
 and other buildings scattered over the
 rest of the countryside. There is a   
 church, a school, a hotel, a public   
 house,nurseries and a garage but no   
 shops in this particular area.        
{Many of the houses}are old but most   
 have been renovated and many extended.
 There is very little new building.    
 There are a few long-established local
 families but also many newcomers who  
 have moved in in recent years.        </content>
