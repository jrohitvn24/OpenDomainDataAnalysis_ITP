		<content> North  Bradley village has no shops in
 it. It only has a Post Office. In a

 families where they buy their clothes.
 It showed that  sixty three people    
 bought their clothes in Bath, twenty  
 seven people bought their clothes in  
 Trowbridge, five families bought their
 clothes in Swindon, three families    
 bought their clothes in Bristol and   
 two families bought their clothes in  
 Frome.We sent out a questionaire too  
 see where families did their main food
 shopping. We surveyed one hundred     
 people and the results showed that    
 ninty four families bought their food 
 in Trowbridge, three families bought  
 their food in Warminster, one family  
 bought their food in Frome and one    
 family bought their food in
