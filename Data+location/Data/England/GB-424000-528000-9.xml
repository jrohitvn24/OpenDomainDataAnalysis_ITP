		<content> Our street is quite untidy. Lots of   
 people throw anything on the floor. It
 is a hazard to old people as they can 
 slip on some rubbish and fall over. It
 has been known to happen. The teacher 
 in our street often lets me play on   
 her computer. I enjoy it. Lots of     
 friends come to play with me in my    
 street. One is Paul Gibson. We play on
 my computer most of the time. Paul and
 I go for bike rides. We both have a   
 racing bike. At the top of our street 
 is a green. I play on the green with  
 Tyson Errington. He is 7 years old.   
 His little brother Warren is only 4.  
 Carrie Errington is 10. During the    
 school holidays I play football with  
 Paul Eales. We have a good game in the
 field.
