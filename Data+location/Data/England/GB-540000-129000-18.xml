		<content> A Good Neighbour Scheme exists;       
 organised by the Church to help those 
 in need when they are ill or infirm.  
 Meals-on-wheels are taken to the      
 elderly.                              
 The lack of facilities for the young  
 in the evening is of concern to       
 parents.                              
 The inhabitants wish to keep the rural
 character of the village. There is    
 great pressure, particularly from     
 Gatwick Airport, to build more houses 
 on avaiable plots - most of which are 
 too expensive for local families who  
 would like to remain here.            
 There is great opposition to the      
 expansion of the Red Lion pub,        
 which would increase traffic, crowds, 
 noise and litter in the area which is 
 of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
