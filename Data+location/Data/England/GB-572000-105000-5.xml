		<title>05Family life in Bexhill</title>
		<content> Family life is alive and well in      
 Bexhill. With many estates, most of   
 Bexhill's community is close-knit.    
 People are always on hand to help sick
 or{disabled}neighbours.               
 During the week{school}ends at about  
 3.30pm. As children make their way    
 home, the adults are winding up their 
 day. For those families with working  
 parents, the evening meal usually     
 comes at about 6.30pm. {Church}groups,
 scouts,cubs,guides and brownies occupy
 people during the evening hours.      
 At weekends people in Bexhill like to 
 get outside and around the town. Of   
 course in summer months the locals    
 like to share the beach with holiday  
 makers. A lot of shopping is done, but
 people usually take a trip to either  
 Hastings or Eastbourne. Sunday is     
 spent quietly at home eating Sunday   
 dinner and going to Church.           </content>
