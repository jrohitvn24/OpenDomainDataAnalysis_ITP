		<content>   The area we have been looking at is 
 mostly farming country.The land is not
 top quality and so much of it is layed
 to pasture for sheep and calf rearing.
    The word{Spreyton}where most of    
 us live,means{"Farm in the Brushwood."
    Spreyton is the highest village    
 in Devon,off the moor,above sea       
 level.The church tower used to be     
 painted white so that it could be seen
 from the Bristol Channel.             
    Thomas Cobley of the famous song   
 was born here in 1762 and became known
 as Uncle Tom Cobley. His grave can be}
 seen in the churchyard.He died in 1844
    Since the arrival of the new A30 to
 Whiddon Down and the planned extension
 to by-pass Okehampton, Exeter and     
 beyond is easy to get to and so more }
 people are moving in. The pretty      
 thatched houses and others are being  
 sold to people who work in towns.     </content>
