		<title>16The Hand and Cleaver Barmaid</title>
		<content>                                       
The  barmaid whom we interviewed  knows
most of the customers by name and  also
what they usually have to drink. She is
friendly  with the customers and  often
talks  to  them while she  is  working.
She lives in Gnosall and gets a lift in
with some of the other employees.      
She sometimes serves the food and takes
orders in the restaurant. Her main work
includes   collecting   the    glasses,
emptying  ash  trays,  wiping   tables,
serving drinks and refilling the spirit
bottles behind the bar.
