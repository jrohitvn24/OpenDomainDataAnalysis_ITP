		<content>           Our school, Lady Anne Cheyne
{Middle School}For Girls, shares the   
 same site as Sir Thomas Cheyne Middle 
{School}For Boys and Richmond Street   
 Primary School. There is a three tier 
 system of{education}on Sheppey.       
           The school was built in 1931
 with the main part of the building    
 being two storeys brick and a single  
 storey of wooden{buildings}around a   
 quadrangle.                           
           It was built as a girls     
 secondary school and became a middle  
 school during reorganisation in 1970. 
           Temporary additions in the  
 form of Horsa huts are still in use   
 today.                                
           An assembly hall was added  
 in the mid sixties to serve also as a 
 gymnasium.                            
           The land on which the school
 is built is below sea level.          </content>
