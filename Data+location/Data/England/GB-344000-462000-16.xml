		<title>16Music Festival at Morecambe.</title>
		<content> Each year The Regional Music School   
 organise a day of music at the College
 of Further Education on Morecambe     
 Road. All children who attend music   
 lessons in this area will be at one   
 music making day. The children will   
 learn music throughout the day and in 
 the evening will perform a concert    
 also at the college. This day is an   
 important part of the childrens music 
 career. The date the concert took     
 place this year was Wednesday 3rd of  
 July. All the children were split up  
 into either Brass Bands, Orchestras,  
 Wind Bands or Ensembles. It was very  
 successful. We played a different     
 assortment of music on this day with  
 the music teachers and children       
 enjoying the day and a great deal of  
 effort being put in. The day and      
 concert were enjoyed by parents,      
 teachers and the children.            </content>
