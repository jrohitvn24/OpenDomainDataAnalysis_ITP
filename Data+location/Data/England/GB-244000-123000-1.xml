		<content>The River Torridge, flowing centrally  
from south to north,is the most        
striking feature of this area.Farming  
is the predominant activity here mainly
on land classified as Grade 3 M.A.F.F..
Urban  development is confined to a    
small encroachment in the north on     
both sides of the river.The only other 
settlement is the small village of     
Landcross,the hamlet of Hallspill,and  
a small part of the dispersed village  
of Littleham.There is oneÂ£ national'   
route through the area the A386, which 
partly because of its Â£scenic' status  
attracts a large flow of traffic in the
summer.Both the estuary of the river   
and nearby woodland, provide important 
habitat for wildlife.Much of the salt- 
marsh has been constituted an S.S.S.I..
The richness and fascination ofthe area
is threatened by some current plans un-
less Conservation is firmly adhered to.</content>
