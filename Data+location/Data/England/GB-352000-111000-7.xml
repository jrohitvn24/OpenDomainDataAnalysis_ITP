		<content> Between 1971 and 1981 there was a{fall
{in population}in the parish of{2.98%. 
 The total number of residents is 1738;
 of these 843(48.5%)were male and 895  
 (51.5%)were female,which gives a      
 difference of 3% more females than    
 males.                                
  In 1981 almost a quarter of the      
 population (i.e.{24.6%}) was of       
{pensionable age.}This is a fairly high
 proportion which might indicate that  
 the average age of the population is  
 increasing.This is also shown by the  
 relatively{low proportion}(17.8%) of  
 children{under}the age of{16.         
  These trends may arise from the      
 decline of industry in the parish     
 (closures of the saw mills and rope   
 works),and the{popularity}of the      
 village for{retirement.               
  A residential home for the elderly   
 has recently been opened.             </content>
