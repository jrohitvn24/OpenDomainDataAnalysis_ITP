		<title>18A DAY IN MY LIFE PART 2</title>
		<content> When the bell goes we go into class,  
 write our spellings and do mathematics
 until playtime. In the 15 minute      
 playtime I eat my apple and play      
 football. After playtime we will      
 either do Swimming, English, Story    
 Book or finish off what ever we were  
 doing before play. At 12 o'clock we   
 eat our lunch . The hall is set out   
 with chairs and tables .When we have  
 finished our lunch we stack the chairs
 into piles of ten. Next we go out to  
 play or we have Recorders, Guitar or  
 Rounders Practice. After play we might
 carry on with our Project or have a   
 game of Rounders. At the end of school
 we put our chairs up on our desks and 
 very often we have a letter to take   
 home. After school we can go to Gym,  
 Drama or Swimming but I usually go to 
 William's and play on his Juno 6O and 
 mess around with the stream.          </content>
