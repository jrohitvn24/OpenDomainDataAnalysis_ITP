 The Music Workshop was started in     
September 1974 to give people learning 
musical instruments the opportunity to 
play together in small groups.         
 Oxfordshire County Council allow the  
use of Icknield Hall,Wantage School on 
Saturday mornings.At present 70        
children and 15 adults attend.There    
are  12 instructors.                   
 Activities include lessons on the     
guitar,recorder,violin,saxophone,French
Horn,trumpet and trombone.After a break
we make music in groups.We call this   
"scrape,bang and blow" There are two   
choirs as well as solo singing,a wind  
band and ensembles for woodwind,guitars
saxophones and recorders.              
 Dramatic productions, such as "Noye's 
Fludde" by Benjamin Britten, are       
produced and performed for parents and 
friends.                               </content>
