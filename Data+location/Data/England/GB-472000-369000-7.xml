 cleaning company.  On the L.N.E.R.    
 railway the station (Junction) has    
 been razed by B.R. and the level      
 crossing, so a long traffic hold up   
 has been replaced by a bridge.        
 To the east of the railway line at    
 (75.7l.4) are the remains of the old  
 gas works.  If one stands there on the
 site of l9th century technology and   
 looks eastwards we can see the power  
 stations that represent the technology
 of the 2Oth century.  To the north of 
 Lincoln Road at (74.4.7l.4) the Holy  
 Well, little evidence of the well can 
 now be seen, but footpaths to East    
 Markham are still clear.  The ribbon  
 development along the roads appear to 
 be coming to an end.  The Al cuts the 
 village N-S and is under repair today 
 (a new hard shoulder is being built - 
 2nd July, l985).                      </content>
