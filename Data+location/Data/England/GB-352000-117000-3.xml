		<title>03LARKHILL ESTATE</title>
		<content>  I questioned my Mum about the        
 difference between the Larkhill Estate
 35 years ago and now.                 
  Larkhill Estate was mostly fields    
 then.The Road was made up as far as   
 Abbey Road and then petered out to    
 just a lane. On the left hand side    
 there was the only shop owned by a    
 Mr.and Mrs.Collins. A little further  
 up,a small estate of Prefabs were put 
 up.These were still there 30 years    
 later.                                
  The only buildings on the right hand 
 side were a few very old cottages and 
 also an old farm called{'Brakes Farm'}
  The farmer used to deliver the milk  
 and people had to collect in jugs     
 outside their homes.This farm fell    
 derelict later.The housing estate is  
 still growing,with industrial         
 development to provide work.
