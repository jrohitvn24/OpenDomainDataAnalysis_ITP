		<title>16SUDELEY- VISITORS' GUIDE Pt3</title>
		<content> Visitors from all over the world visit
 Sudeley Castle. As well as tourists   
 who come just because they have seen  
 the sign at the top of the road, there
 are visitors from America, Ireland and
 New Zealand. Most people are visiting 
 for the first time. Some are          
 interested in Castles, others come to 
 see the exhibition of toys and dolls. 
 The first part of the castle that they
 go to is the Chapel. One part that    
 many find interesting is the Falcon   
 Centre.
