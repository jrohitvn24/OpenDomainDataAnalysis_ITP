		<title>14COMMUTING FROM HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> Since the War the increasing price of 
 property in London, added to the speed
 of travel after electrification of the
 railways prompted many London workers 
 to live well outside the capital and  
 travel daily by rail. Although it is  
 about sixty miles from London many    
 people commute from Herne Bay and the 
 station is particularly busy between 7
 and 8 a.m. and between 6 and 7 p.m..  
 From our class of 28 pupils at Hampton
 three had parents (two fathers and one
 mother) who travelled daily to London.
 One worked in a bank, one for the     
 B.B.C. and one for British Rail.      
 Although it means a very long day most
 commuters say that if they have to    
 work in London they would rather live 
 in the country near the coast. In this
 Block many commuters live in the      
 Beltinge area because although further
 to the station the houses are good.   </content>
