		<title>13LEVER'S CASTLE</title>
		<content>    William Hesketh Lever,Viscount     
 Leverhulme,provided much of interest  
 in his country park.Permanent         
 memorials to him were erected by his  
 son in the form of two pylons pitched 
 like giant gateposts at the foot of   
 Lever Park Avenue,initially his       
 carriage drive to the bungalow.One of 
 Lever's own memorials was the castle  
 he built at the edge of the geeat lake
 of Rivington reservoir.               
    Ir comes in the tradition of       
 Victorian follies for it is a mere    
 copy of Liverpool Castle.As this had  
 been severly damaged in the English   
 Civil War, all that Lever could copy  
 was a ruined shell with battered      
 ramparts. Yet copy it he did and it   
 does provide a sudden surprising sight
 on a hillock close to the Rivington   
 reservoir.You approach it along one of
 his tree-lined avenues.               </content>
