		<content>   Horsted Keynes is a very active     
 small community having several dozen  
 recreational and special interest     
 groups which meet periodically or     
 regularly. Clubs for young people     
 include Brownies, Scouts and Cubs     
 (with Danehill), and the weekly Youth 
 Club. Women's organisations abound:   
 there are Housewives Register and     
 Mother and Toddler groups, monthly    
 meetings of the W.I. and Young Wives, 
 and a Women's Fellowship.             
   The Horsted/Cahagnes Society has    
 re-established links with the place in
 Normandy which gave the village its   
 name. Exchange visits are arranged    
 from time to time. The Bonfire Club   
 holds regular functions to support the
 annual village fireworks festivities.
