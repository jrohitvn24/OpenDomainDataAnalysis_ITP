		<title>08Commuting to work</title>
		<content> As our grid squares cover a rural area
 we wished to find out whether people  
 travelled to{work}in other towns or   
 worked locally.To do this we{         
{interviewed}local residents  of the   
 four main villages ( Upper and Lower  
 Cumberworth,Denby Dale,Skelmanthorpe).
 Our survey results showed that many { 
 people  worked in Huddersfield and the
 surrounding districts and those who   
 worked further afield eg Sheffield,   
 Manchester, Leeds lived where there   
 was good access to major routes and   
 also occupied larger detached houses. 
 There is also a significant number of 
{retired people}for whom housing and   
 welfare provisions are made. Increases
 in the level of commuting are due     
 mainly to the comparatively low       
 housing costs, the increase in car    
 ownership and the general improvement 
 in trunk and motorway routes.         </content>
