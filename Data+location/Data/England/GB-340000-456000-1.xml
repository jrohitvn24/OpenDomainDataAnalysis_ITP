		<content>The block comprises most of the parish 
of Overton,Middleton,and some of       
Sunderland Point.The villages of       
Overton and Middleton can be found in  
the North-West corner of Lancashire,   
3 miles south of the city of Lancaster,
near the resort town of Morecambe.     
The small settlement at Sunderland     
Point,lies 2 miles south of Overton,and
is accessible only at low tide.        
The area is dominated by the salt-     
marshes of the Lune Estuary.The        
villages are very low-lying,and rural  
in character.Overton and Middleton were
mentioned in the original Domesday     
survey.OvertonÂ£s chapel dates from     
Anglo-Saxon times-it is the oldest     
church in Lancashire.Many of the       
present families can trace their       
descent back for 300 years or so.
