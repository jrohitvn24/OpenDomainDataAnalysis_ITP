		<content>{Stag}is an out door game  you can play
 in a large or small area. You need    
 about 10 or more people to play and 2 
 people,a boy and a girl, are on to    
 start the game. These people run      
 around trying to tig other people. You
 do this by touching their back or arm 
 and saying 'STAG!'. When everybody is 
 caught the game is over. The first two
 people caught are on at the start of  
 the next game.       J. Sullivan      
{Marbles}is a seasonal game played by 2
 people each with a marble. The object 
 of the game is to win your opponents  
 marble by hitting it. You take it in  
 turns to take shots. We play among the
 rocks to stop other people from       
 kicking them. There are many types and
 sizes of marbles. They have different 
 colours and patterns. Big marbles are 
 called Pharoahs or Kings. The rarest  
 are plain, coloured marbles.   J.Smith</content>
