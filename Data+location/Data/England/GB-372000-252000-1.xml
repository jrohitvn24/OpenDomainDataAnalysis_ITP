		<title>01THE AREA.</title>
		<content>  This block is in a rural area.It is  
 rolling countryside with a ridge of   
 high ground running through the centre
 from The Warren in the north to the   
 Suckley Hills in the south.The hills  
 are densely wooded,mostly with broad  
 leaf trees, though there are a few    
 stands of conifers and areas of mixed 
 woodland.                             
  Suckley Green is in the N.W.and      
 consists of isolated houses and farms.
 The village of Alfrick is in the E.and
 is a large community with Alfrick     
 Pound to the south.                   
  Alfrick is an isolated village.There 
 is only a limited bus service-four    
 times daily Monday-Saturday with no   
 buses on Sunday.The village school    
 closed two years ago,so children      
 travel to Suckley on the school bus.  
 There is one shop/post office and one 
 public house.                         </content>
