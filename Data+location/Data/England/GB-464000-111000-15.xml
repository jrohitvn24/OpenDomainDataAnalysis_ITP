		<title>15Motor Cars In Denmead.</title>
		<content>  Transport in Denmead is a case of    
 needing a car because the bus services
 are so poor. However, it can be argued
 that the poor standard of bus services
 is only a reflection of the high      
 rates of car ownership in this area.  
  In Denmead nearly 60% of the         
 population have 2 cars or more; in    
 Wecock this figure is 30%. Only about 
 5% of the population do not have a    
 car.                                  
  As such, the dominant mode of        
 transport to and from work is by car. 
 Some people travel to work by bicycle 
 but very few use the bus.             
{N.B.}For information about bus        
 services in this area see Page 14.
