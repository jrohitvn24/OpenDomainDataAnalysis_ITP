   When we paid a visit, we noticed    
 that it hadn't changed very much since
 we left 5 years ago. As we arrived it 
 was break time and the pupils were    
 playing in the playground. They were  
 playing 'Kisscat','Stuck-in-the-mud',&amp;
 'Touchy'.There were also empty Car    
 Tyres to play on. At the end of break 
 the handbell was rung for the children
 to return to their lessons.           
   During lunchtime at the school, many
 of the pupils bring a packed lunch as 
 School Dinners are becoming quite     
 expensive.                            
   Looking at the school now, the      
 outside appearance is just as it was  
 when built 56 years ago, &amp; it would be
 interesting to know if it will stay   
 the same in the future.
