 There are two local controversies in  
 this town.                            
 The first is a plan to build a car    
 park on a piece of land called Swan   
 Meadows. It is five minutes walk from 
 the town centre. People like to go    
 their to feed the ducks. Although it  
 is of no great ecological importance  
 it is pleasant to have a rural corner 
 almost in the town centre. On the     
 other hand parking is a problem.      
                                       
 The second controversy centres on the 
 Parish Church. The choirmaster has    
 been dismissed and the choir suspended
 and there is a contested plan by the  
 church to sell the old rectory which  
 is a listed building and build houses 
 on the site.                          
                                       </content>
