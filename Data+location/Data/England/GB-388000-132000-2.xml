 0nce there was an assizes in Hindon.  
 Later we had just a police station.   
 Until recently we had a policeman who 
 lived in a police house. We haven't   
 got any of that now. Now we have to   
 phone Tisbury or Mere police stations.
 They are not open all the time but    
 Salisbury police station is.          
 Neither Tisbury or Mere have their own
 police dogs but they have their own   
 patrol cars. We don't have any serious
 crimes or murders. Sometimes we have  
 burglaries. They have a lot of        
 accidents on the A303. They are caused
 by children screaming in the backs of 
 cars and people overtaking in the     
 wrong place. In Salisbury police      
 station they have computers that can  
 tell them details about burglaries.
