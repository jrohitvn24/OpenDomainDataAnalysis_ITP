		<title>08CHATFIELDS TIMBER YARD</title>
		<content> Over 200 years after its beginning,   
 Chatfields of Cooksbridge is still    
 owned by the same family and{employs  
{25 people.}12 years ago the whole yard
 was destroyed by a tremendous fire,   
 so hot that the curtains in the houses
 opposite caught alight. Fire engines  
 came from Kent and Surrey.            
 Chatfields timber comes from North and
 South America, USSR and Scandanavia.  
 It is{mostly soft wood,}as hard woods 
 are too expensive, and comes in 10-12m
 lengths. Chatfields many circular     
 and band saws are sharpened twice a   
 week.After being treated, wood is made
 into skirting boards,window and door  
 frames and other pieces of carpentry. 
 Apart from wood{Chatfields sells other
{building materials}like concrete and  
 bricks. Chatfields deliver within a   
 hundred mile radius,mostly to builders
 but will also sell to the public.     </content>
