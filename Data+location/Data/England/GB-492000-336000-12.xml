		<content> Recently, members of the Ramblers     
 Assoiation in this district have      
 reported that footpaths and routeways 
 are in need of attention. Causes of   
 deterioration are due both to man and 
 nature.  Some public ways become      
 overgrown.  Others have been ploughed 
 out by local farmers as hedges are    
 torn out fields enlarged and new      
 farming systems introduced. Sign posts
 and direction markers are sometimes   
 removed or allowed to fall into misuse
 or simply vandalised. There are parts 
 of the area however which are very    
 well cared for.  Belton Park estate   
 lands are once again open to the      
 public thanks to the National Trust.  
 Some restrictions have to be imposed  
 for the safeguarding of livestock,    
 mostly sheep, but the park offers a   
 rich and varied rambling environment.
