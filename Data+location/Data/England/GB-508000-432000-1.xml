		<title>01 BRANSHOLME SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The central shopping zone, still under
 development after fifteen years, shows
 the bleak aspect typical of 1960's    
 "big is beautiful" town planning. Only
 people arriving by car can arrive     
 nearly dry and unruffled in bad       
 weather.The interior of the shopping  
 centre, in complete contrast, reduces 
 the scale, to a cosy, enclosed human  
 scale, especially the covered market  
 at the heart of the complex.          
                                       
 The surrounding monotonously uniform  
 housing, much of it of "unit          
 construction", now is beginning to    
 show signs of individuality, as people
 replace standardised window frames and
 doors, but the open spaces remain as  
 spaces rather than playing or meeting 
 areas and the abundant blank walls    
 invite spray-can graffiti.
