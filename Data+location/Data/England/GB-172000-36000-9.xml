		<title>09Shopping In Stithians</title>
		<content> Stithians has three shops, a post     
 office, a newsagents/ general store   
{(VG)} and the corner store. All the   
 shops are run by married couples who  
 seem to enjoy being shopkeepers. The  
{VG}and corner stores are handy for the
 villagers because it saves petrol or  
 bus fares. The{Corner Stores}also     
 called{Macs,}sells everything from    
 bread to umbrellas. Bread was their   
 best selling item, they sell a lot of 
 sweets especially Mars Bars. They also
 accept telephone orders especially    
 from pensioners and deliver them.     
 Suprisingly this shop had a defence   
 siren in case of an attack. The paper 
 shop sold more papers than anything   
 else and their most unusual item was a
 watering can. The{post office}sells   
 more 17p stamps than they do sweets,  
 toys and stationery.
