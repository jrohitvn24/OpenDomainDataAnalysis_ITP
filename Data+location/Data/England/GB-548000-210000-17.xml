		<title>17Lady Gibberd's Garden</title>
		<content>{Lady Gibberd's}house is in Marsh Lane.
 The garden covers 7 acres.{Pincey's   
{Brook,}a tributary of the{River Stort,
 runs through the garden.              
                                       
{Sir Frederick Gibberd}designed the    
 garden to hold statues and sculptures 
 which he used to buy to help young    
 artists. The garden also has many     
 fountains.                            
                                       
 Near the brook is a model fort made   
 from the trunks of elm trees which had
 died from Dutch Elm Disease. Sir      
 Frederick built the fort for his      
 grandchildren.                        
                                       
{Lady Gibberd} opens the garden to the 
 public each year to raise money for   
 charity.
