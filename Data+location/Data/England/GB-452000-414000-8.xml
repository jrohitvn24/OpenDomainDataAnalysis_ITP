		<title>08NORTON SEWAGE WORKS.</title>
		<content>   At present Norton and Campsall are  
 served by a fairly small sewage works 
 serving 3800 people and Askern and    
 Sutton by a 65 year old works serving 
 5700 people. Both systems are         
 oversubscribed and therefore prevent  
 either industrial or housing develop- 
 ment.  In 1980 the {YORKSHIRE WATER   
{AUTHORITY} decided to build a new     
 sewage treatment plant at Norton to   
 replace the two existing plants.      
 Sewage from Askern will be pumped to  
 the new system at Norton and the new  
 system will enable to capacity to be  
 increased to serve 13500 persons.     
    The work on the new plant commenced
 in September 1984 and the work is due 
 for completion in September 1986      
 although it is ahead of schedule at   
 present.  The consultant engineers    
 are Balfours of London and the civil  
 engineers responsible are Henry Boot. </content>
