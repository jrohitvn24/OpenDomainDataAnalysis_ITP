 The South Downs stretch for many miles
 from just north of Southhampton to    
 Beachy Head.                          
  They provide excellant shelter for   
 many villages which are tucked under  
 the scarp slope.Also they shelter     
 numerous coastal towns which are      
 situated between the sea and the dip  
 slope.                                
  The rolling south downs are scattered
 with lots of farms.Farm machinery     
 cannot operate on the steep scarp     
 slope and so this land is often used  
 for grazing,sheep and cattle.         
  Crops are often grown on the top     
 flats of the Downs and the most common
 are barley and rape.                  
  The rape is grown for the oil which  
 is contained in it's seeds.The yellow 
 flowers of the rape provide a blaze of
 colour which can be seen from thecoast</content>
