		<title>01Swineshead, Location</title>
		<content> Swineshead lies 12 miles north of     
 Bedford, being formally part of       
 Huntingdonshire.                      
 In 1888, it was transferred to        
 Bedfordshire, the county to which it  
 always geographically belonged.       
 It is a small unspoilt village        
 consisting mainly of old colour washed
 thatched and tiled cottages, dating   
 between 17th and 19th centuries       
 originally under the ownership of the 
 Duchy of Manchester.                  
 Many of the cottages have been        
 extended by widening the upper storey 
 and enclosing this into a shallow     
 pegged tile roof. Several of the      
 houses were formally working farms.   
 All have recently been renovated.     
 The land around Swineshead is used for
 arable farming main crops being wheat,
 barley and rape, a more unusual crop  
 is evening primrose.                  </content>
