		<content> The area is rich in birdlife  on      
 moorland, farmland and woodland as    
 well as near numerous small streams.  
 Blackbirds, robins &amp; thrushes are seen
 in profusion, as are flocks of yellow 
 hammers, chaffinches, sparrows &amp;      
 starlings. Many species of the tit    
 family, blue, great, long tailed &amp;    
 blackcap, breed happily. On farmland &amp;
 moorland, pheasants &amp; partridge, red  
 grouse &amp; curlew can be seen with a    
 lesser number of woodcock. Redwings &amp; 
 fieldfares are winter visitors &amp; in   
 summer swallows, swifts &amp; cuckoos     
 come. Pigeons &amp; collared doves breed  
 in profusion in the woods together    
 with other members of the crow        
 family.By streams the occasional      
 kingfisher &amp; heron may be seen.       
 Kestrels hunt by day &amp; owls by night. 
 Magpies are increasing. A snow bunting
 was sighted in 1979.                  </content>
