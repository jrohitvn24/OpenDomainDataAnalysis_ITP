		<content> At first sight there is little to     
 suggest that Sale possesses historical
 origins outside the 20th century.     
 However, some traces of its earlier   
 history remain, eg the main highway,  
 the A56 which follows the course of   
 the Roman road, Watling Street; the   
 Bridgewater Canal, substantially      
 unchanged in appearance, but now used 
 solely by pleasure craft; several     
 houses and cotages dating from the    
 18th and early 19th centuties; a dove 
 cote near the M63 roundabout, marking 
 the site of Sale Old Hall. The most   
 important pointers to Sale's develop  
 -ment are the stations at Sale and    
 Brooklands. Sale opened in 1849 and   
 turned a rural community into a       
 dormitory and commuter suburb for     
 Manchester. Ther many fine, large     
 Victorian houses(sought-after)witness 
 Sale's 19th century development.      </content>
