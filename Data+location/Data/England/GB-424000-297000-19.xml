		<title>19MODERN SEQUENCE DANCE CLUB.</title>
		<content> We meet at Grendon Working Men's Club 
 on Tuesday evenings at 7.30.We pay 30p
 each week;there are 90 members,aged   
 between fifty and seventy,from all    
 walks of life. The first half hour is 
 tuition time when Colin and Carol walk
 us through a new dance,which perhaps  
 takes three weeks to learn.The fun    
 starts when he puts the record on and 
 we are not very sure of the steps!    
 From 8.00-10.30 we dance those we have
 learned over the past 5 years,such as 
 Happy Feet Quickstep,Honeysuckle      
 Saunter,Rumba Victoria,Iris Foxtrot,  
 Beverley Ann Waltz,Sally Ann Cha Cha, 
 Cindy Swing etc. Lots of members are  
 widows,so some ladies 'take' as a     
 man,NEVER two men together.Most ladies
 drink 'Slimline' orange while the men 
 enjoy a pint of beer.Colin holds a    
 Saturday evening Dance once a month to
 which we all look forward.            </content>
