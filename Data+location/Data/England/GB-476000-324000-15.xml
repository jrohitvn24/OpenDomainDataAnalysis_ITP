		<title>15Teenage view of Village Life</title>
		<content>  Most of the teenagers interviewed in 
 the past few weeks seem to enjoy      
 living in a village like Scalford,    
 especially in the summer time. At that
 time of the year everyone hangs around
 together and it is easy to find things
 to do in the village. Sometimes       
 everyone joins in water fights which  
 are great fun,or in other outdoor     
 games.                                
     Village life is not so popular    
 with teenagers in winter time. They   
 have problems in getting transport to 
 events in the town and there is less  
 to do in the village. Badminton and   
 Youth Club are the only organised     
 entertainments available.             
     A few teenagers do not enjoy      
 village life at all, they would rather
 live in a town where there is more    
 entertainment.
