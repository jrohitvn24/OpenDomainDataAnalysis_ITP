 groceries from Cheltenham.            
    They have eight machines,bun       
 divider,dough mixer,tart maker,cake   
 mixer,pastry roller,ham slicer,bacon  
 slicer and scales.The fuels used are  
 diesel, oil and electricity.          
    The bakery was once a police-      
 station and the oven was the prison   
 cell. The oven can hold 230 loaves.   
    The baker starts at 3a.m. on       
 Saturday,5.30a.m. other days.         
    There are 200 customers in the 11  
 villages visited by the van.The van   
 round takes 5 hours to do.They like a 
 village business because they know all
 their customers. Old people without   
 transport can shop in the village.
