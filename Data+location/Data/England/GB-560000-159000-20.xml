		<title>20HOUSING.Vigo Village.</title>
		<content>     In our D block is included a part 
 of Vigo Village.The village,set in    
 woodland,is relatively new.The first  
 houses being built about 19 years     
 ago.All houses are privately owned and
 range from terraced to detached       
 properties.Although the amenities of  
 the village are outside our area      
 naturally all people living in the    
 village use these facilities.         
     All of the children questionned   
 enjoy living in the village.They      
 particularily like the village        
 atmosphere with its social amenities  
 and the proximity to Trosley Park.    
    As yet there is no church in the   
 village but the village hall is used  
 for religious meetings.A public house 
 has just been built.The main complaint
 was that the local bus service was    
 unreliable and expensive
