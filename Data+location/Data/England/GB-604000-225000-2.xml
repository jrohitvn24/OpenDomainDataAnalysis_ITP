		<title>02PARISH CHURCH,ELMSTEAD.</title>
		<content>    Elmstead{Parish Church}is next to  
 Elmstead{Hall.}It is mainly a{14th    
{century}building.One interesting      
 feature of the church is the{wooden   
{effigy,}possibly of{Sir Thomas Weston.
 It dates from between 1345 and 1360.  
 It is solid wood and the feet rest on 
 a child's lap.Another feature is two  
 tiny{windows}in the chapel dating back
 to the 14th century with the original 
 glass intact.It was supposedly used by
 people who had a disease and were not 
 allowed to come into the church.      
    The latest addition to the church  
 is an{octagonal extension}built in    
 1982.It is used for providing         
 refreshments, meetings and Sunday     
 school;40 people attend Sunday        
 services and 30 children go to Sunday 
 School.The present{incumbent}is the   
 70th. Vicar of Elmstead.
