		<content> In winter the roads are deserted      
 because the East wind is too cold for 
 the holidaymakers.All the caravan     
 sites and amenities are closed        
 down.When the weather is not too bad  
 my friends and I go for a bike ride to
 the beach and gaze out at the sea.    
 Often in the afternoons I take our dog
 for a walk to the park.He is usually  
 quite lively in the mornings so I get 
 the ball and play with him in the back
 garden.Some winter days it is too cold
 to be outside so I go and call for my 
 friends.Then we watch television or   
 play with our games.When there is     
 nothing to do,instead of just being   
 bored, I help my Mum.Sometimes I dust 
 the furniture or at other times I bake
 some cakes for tea.
