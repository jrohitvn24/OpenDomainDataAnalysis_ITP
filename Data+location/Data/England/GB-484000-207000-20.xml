		<title>20Rothschilds And Wendover</title>
		<content>Victorian millionaire banker Alfred de 
Rothschild created a continental       
chateau at nearby Halton, bringing     
Royalty and extravagance.  In 1914,    
Alfred lent his parkland to            
Kitchener's army who mustered and      
trained before facing the mud of       
Flanders. The RFC took over and on his 
death in 1918 Alfred's estate which    
had seen a staff of hundreds,          
performances by Melba, agricultural    
shows, circuses, hunting parties and   
champagne picnics became RAF Halton,   
his chateau the officers' Mess. The    
 uildings, hostelries and life in 1985 
Wendover still reflect Rothschild'     
philanthropy and the effects of        
providing "out of camp" needs of       
countless soldiers and airmen.         
Words, impressions and photographs by  
pupils, staff and parents of Wendover  
Middle School.                         </content>
