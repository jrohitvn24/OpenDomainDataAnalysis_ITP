		<content> Wooler First School celebrates its    
 25th Anniversary in September 1985.To 
 mark the occasion they have started a 
 Silver Jubilee Fund to raise money for
 computers in the classroom.Local      
 businessmen have already given genero-
 usly to the fund.                     
    A run away horse charged through   
 Wooler after escaping from its field. 
 It ran out of a dark alley straight in
 to a car.The car was badly damaged but
 both the driver and the horse were un-
 hurt.
