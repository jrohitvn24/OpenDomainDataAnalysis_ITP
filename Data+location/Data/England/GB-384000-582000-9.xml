		<title>09REDESMOUTH</title>
		<content>  Redesmouth is a{hamlet}about two     
 miles from Bellingham. It is so called
 because the River Rede meets the River
 North Tyne here.                      
  There are twenty two{houses}all of   
 these except one were owned by the    
 railway.They were built for railway  }
 workers.                              
  It used to be a very busy place      
 because two railway lines met         
 here.Children from Bellingham used to 
 come on the train for a penny,run     
 across the bridge and go back with the
 new driver who changed trains at      
 Redesmouth.                           
  The lines and bridge have gone but   
 the station,signal box,turntable,     
 platform and engine sheds can still be
 seen although they are now used by the
 farmer.                               
  Now it is a quiet place where people 
 can enjoy the footpaths and scenery.  </content>
