  We asked some of the villagers what  
they would like to have in their       
village in the future.Here is a list   
of them.                               
Childrens play area, a sports ground,  
mains gas ,a proper library and a      
public telephone box that works        
properly.                              
 Many people we spoke to said they     
wished they had a doctors surgery in   
the village.Wellingborough was too far 
to travel to see a doctor.However the  
doctor did visit the village twice a   
week.                                  
                                       
                                       
           o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
