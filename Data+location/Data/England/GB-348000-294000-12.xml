		<title>12MUSIC IN CARDINGTON,ctd.</title>
		<content>    Between the secular and the sacred 
 lie the occasional village hall/bell  
 fund and organ fund/ musical evenings,
 the last one being a particularly     
 unusual one - the gift of a grand     
 piano,all the way from Jamaica! Every-
 one participated in his/her own style,
 the result being a complete mixture of
 classical,folk,sacred,pop and saucy   
 which was received with warmth and    
 unity and in the best kind of village 
 tradition.                            
    The singing of the birds,the voices
 of children,the sounds of artisans'   
 machinery,church bells,villagers      
 exchanging accepted cliches against   
 the background of spring lambs,the    
 howl of the wind and the beating of   
 rain,all mingle with the formal and   
 informal attempts at the music making 
 of this community.
