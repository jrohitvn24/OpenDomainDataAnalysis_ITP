		<title>11Employment in our area</title>
		<content> Employment is difficult to find in our
 area and many people are self employ- 
 ed,starting small businesses or hiring
 themselves out at peak times e.g.to   
 farmers at haytime or lambing.        
    At one time British Gypsum was the 
 main employer for people livimg here  
 but they are cutting down on their    
 workers.Farmers too are cutting down  
 on their workers they employ and runn-
 ing farms as a family business.       
    Unemployment is causing concern in 
 the whole country but in rural areas  
 there are fewer companies that people 
 can turn to for jobs.                 
    Young people leaving school with no
 hope of finding a job hang about the  
 village pub or institute and come down
 to watch,and sometimes join in,games  
 lessons.                              
    Many move away from the area to    
 bigger places to find work.           </content>
