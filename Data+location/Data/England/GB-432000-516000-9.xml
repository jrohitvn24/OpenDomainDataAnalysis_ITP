		<title>09THE TOP SHOP</title>
		<content> I live in one of the shops in the     
 village.It is called the Top Shop.The 
 only other shop is the  post office   
 our shop used to be a pub called the  
 Red Lion.In our shop we sell          
 newspapers and magazine.The newspaper 
 we sell the most of is the Northern   
 Echo we sell 120 copies of it a day   
 and it costs 18p,we also sell the     
 mirror,the star,the daily express and 
 the telegraph.The newspapers are      
 brought to the shop by a van at       
 5'o'clock in the morning so my dad has
 to get up at 6'0'clock and sort them  
 out.We have four paper boys to deliver
 to the houses.We also sell food bread,
 ham,beef frozen chickens,ice cream and
 lots of different tinned food.We sell 
 toys and other different things there 
 is one disadvantage I can never resist
 the sweets.   By Claire Monteith AGE 9
