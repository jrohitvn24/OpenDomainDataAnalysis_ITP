 Rams Hill House which at one time had 
 a shop attached to it is now purely   
 living accommodation                  
 Railway Line now disused              
 The Paddock Wood to Horsmonden railway
 line opened in October 1892 and was   
 used to bring the large numbers of hop
 pickers from London for the annual hop
 picking season and also for carrying  
 the harvest of fruit and vegetables   
 and plants to London                  
 The track has been removed over this  
 section of the line but the old       
 Railway Bridge is still standing in   
 Swigs Hole Lane making a very imposing
 entrance to Swigs Hole Farm           
 The track going back towards Rams Hill
 has been used as a refuse tip and only
 the road bridge is now visible        
 although this does not go over        
 anything                              </content>
