		<title>13SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Apperley has one shop which sells     
 everyday produce. For clothes and     
 groceries the villagers shop in       
 Tewkesbury (5 miles) or Gloucester (12
 miles) where national chain stores can
 be found. Better quality shops can be 
 found in Cheltenham, 10 miles away. As
 well as selling food the shop is      
 also a Post Office. Buses, operated by
 the private bus company,              
 'Swanbrooks' of Cheltenham, run nearly
 every hour from eight o'clock to six  
 thirty but in winter the buses run    
 later as snow and floods can hinder a 
 normal route. Many people own cars    
 and go to Gloucester to do their      
 shopping where there is a big         
 supermarket called 'Asda'.  This      
 new superstore also provides a free   
 Saturday bus service from Tewkesbury.
