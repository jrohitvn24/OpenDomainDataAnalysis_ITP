		<title>13The Miners' Strike</title>
		<content>   In March 1984 there was a strike.   
 People all over Great Britain were    
 affected, families split up and left  
 the area.Businesses went bankrupt,    
 shopkeepers had to shut down. In the  
 winter it was cold. They had no coal. 
   At Christmas the miner's children   
 were given second hand clothes and    
 toys.The children were always hungry. 
 Their mothers could not afford to feed
 them.                                 
   People sent money for them but it   
 could not help much.They were given   
 food parcels at least. Wives opened up
 soup kitcens for the men.             
   Over the holidays schools put meals 
 on for the miners' children. I thought
 that this was very kind.
