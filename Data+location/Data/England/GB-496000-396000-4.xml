 hut which was given to the village by 
 the army.                             
    The children of the village went to
 Waddingham school which was built in {
 1830. The children had two weeks off  
 school to go potato picking.          
    The only means of transport from   
 the village to Brigg was a horse and  
 cart until in 1937 a bus was bought.

 could afford it had electricity.A few 
 people had telephones and most had
