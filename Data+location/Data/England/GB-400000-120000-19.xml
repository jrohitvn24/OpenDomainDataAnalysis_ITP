		<title>19LIFESTYLE IN BOWERCHALKE</title>
		<content> Nearly a half of all households have  
 moved here within the last 15 years.  
 People choose to live here for its    
 peace, its clean air &amp; beautiful      
 surroundings. It provides many varied 
 walks on ancient trackways and foot-  
 paths, often maintained by            
 residents.Youths occasionally ride on 
 these paths on motor bikes. Litter is 
 collected by the Women's Institute,   
 but , so far, the "Best Kept Village" 
 has escaped us. For the Elderly, there
 is a monthly Club, and a weekly Day   
 Centre serves the whole Chalke Valley.
 There is no sport facility for child- 
 ren &amp; young people. Baptist &amp; Anglican
 Churches have loyal following. A      
 Mobile Library visits fortnightly. Day
 -time classes are held in Dressmaking,
 Upholstery &amp; Art. The whole Village   
 comes together for the Annual Flower &amp;
 Produce Show held in August.          </content>
