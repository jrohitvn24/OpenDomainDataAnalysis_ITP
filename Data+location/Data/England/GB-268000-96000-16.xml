   Andy Hampers have two computers an  
 Optin 200 and an Octopus,several      
 printers and lots of screens.The big  
 computer is linked to the Hull office.
   The holiday business is mostly for  
 Americans who want to stay on farms or
 in country houses.The holidays are    
 given star ratings and go up to five  
 star,which is the best.               
   There are 7200 agents all over the  
 country helping to sell all these     
 things and Andy Hampers do there own  
 advertising in brochures,newspapers   
 and on television.                    
   This year when we went to the       
 offices we saw some new buildings     
 being built to give them more         
 space.They have some plans to sell    
 other things next year as well, but   
 this is a secret at the moment.
