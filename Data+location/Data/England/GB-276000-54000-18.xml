		<content> At the moment the thing to have is a  
{BMX bike.} These are pedal bicycles   
 especially designed for trick riding  
 and cross-country.  Out of sixteen    
 boys in our class ten have got BMX    
 bikes.  They are great fun.  There are
 even national competitions to find the
 best riders.                          
                                       
 Lots of us have got or are getting    
{roller-boots.}These are like          
 roller-skates but the rollers are     
 fixed to a pair of boots which you    
 have to put on.  The wheels are made  
 of nylon.  You can go very fast on    
 them.  We are allowed to bring them to
 school and skate on the school terrace
 at play-time.  Sometimes we fall over 
 and cut our knees.  Mr Peach says he's
 going to start charging us for all the
 plasters we use from the first-aid.
