		<content>   Apart from the Royal Ordnance PLC   
 factory in the south west of the area 
 there are no large scale industries in
 the district. Most people who live    
 here work outside the area and commute
 to work daily in the surrounding      
 towns. There is a good network of     
 motorways for journeys to Preston,    
 Lancaster, Manchester, Liverpool and  
 Wigan.                                
   The workers at the ROF come in from 
 the surrounding areas and many are    
 carried by a private fleet of coaches.
   Many temporary jobs have been       
 created in the building industry by   
 the development of new housing areas  
 and their associated roads and        
 services.                             
   East of the M61, outside the New    
 Town boundary, the main source of     
 employment is still farming.
