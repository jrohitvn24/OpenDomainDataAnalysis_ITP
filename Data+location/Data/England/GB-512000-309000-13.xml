		<title>13THE MARKET</title>
		<content> The market is held on a Wednesday and 
 is very popular.Sometimes,the stalls  
 people need are not there but this is 
 not so always.The most used stall is  
 the sweets and cake stall.Some people 
 think that it would better if it was  
 held in the new Rainbow Supermarket   
 carpark.There are about 26 stalls     
 altogether.Most of the stall holders  
 said that they chose this job because 
 they wanted to be their own boss.The  
 stallholders come from quite a few    
 different places.For instance, the    
 owner of the  pet food stall comes    
 only a quarter of a mile while the    
 holder of the jacket and coat stall   
 travels 20 miles.The market is used by
 a lot of local people because it      
 offers an interesting range of        
 goods at competitive prices.
