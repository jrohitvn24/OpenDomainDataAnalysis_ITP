 and wanted to preserve a part of the  
 past.His oldest tractor is one that is

 over 100 people in his club. You can

 tractors to shows. He wins a lot of   
 prizes. He wins cups,medals and       
 trophies.The John Deer wins the most  
 trophies.He has 17 tractors.His       
 tractors come from the U.S.A.,the
