		<title>07LEVEN CANAL</title>
		<content> Our village has an unusual feature  we
 have a private canal. The canal was   
 built and opened in 1802, it was      
 promoted by Mrs Charlotta Bethell of  
 Rise, who was a very important        
 landowner.(The Bethell family are     
 still Lords of the manor of Leven).The
 canal runs in nearly a straight line  
 from the river Hull, where there is a 
 disused lock, for three &amp; a quarter   
 miles to its head.The canal was built 
  to improve trade links between Hull &amp;
 Leven, Humber Keel boats,up to 85 tons
 were able to use it, bringing cargoes 
 such as coal, lime &amp; manure from Hull 
 &amp; carrying corn &amp; bricks away.        
  Today the canal has no boats on it,  
 people come to stay at a small caravan
 site. Some people like to come to fish
 there is a Trout farm.Local people use
 the canal for walks &amp; birdwatching as 
 it is very pretty.                    </content>
