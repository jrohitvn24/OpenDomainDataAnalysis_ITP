		<title>10Thatching in Ropley</title>
		<content> Jim Coomber is a thatcher who came to 
 tell us about his job.He worked with a
 master thatcher for 4 years to learn  
 but now he is on his own.Jim likes to 
 use straw for his roofs.He thinks it  
 looks nicer than reed.Norfolk reed is 
 the most expensive - it comes from    
 Austria now.Jim used it to thatch the 
 Old Parsonage Tythe Barn.Jim showed us
 his tools.Some were very old &amp; some he
 made himself from simple things like  
 an old chair leg &amp; flat piece of wood 
 with nails in to comb the straw.Straw 
 &amp; reed are sharp and cut you so Jim   
 wears leather kneepads.Hazel pegs are 
 used to keep the bundles of reed or   
 straw on the roof.Jim split some hazel
 twigs to show us.Jim puts a special   
 pattern on the thatch to show it is   
 his work.Jim has just got married and 
 has bought a house near the shop which
 he is re-thatching.                   </content>
