		<content> At the age of four ,or nearly five ,  
you start in the First School. Then    
when you are nine you start in the     
Middle School. When you are thirteen   
you leave and start at the High School.
 You can leave the High School when you
are sixteen ,or you can stay on at the 
High School until you are eighteen.    
 Valley Gardens is a Middle School with
children aged nine to thirteen. My     
sister is already at Valley Gardens and
I am starting in the first year in     
September. I am going to look around   
the school on Wednesday. My Mum was at 
Valley Gardens when she was at school. 
That shows how old Valley Gardens is. A
few years ago a new building was built.
It is now the first year block.
