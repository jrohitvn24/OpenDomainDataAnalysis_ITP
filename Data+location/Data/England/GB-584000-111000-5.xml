		<title>05FARMING FAIRLIGHT, E. SUSSEX</title>
		<content> There are 21 farms in Fairlight, parts
 of Guestling and Pett, East Sussex.   
 They are family farms of between 120  
 and 170 acres.                        
                                       
 The main farming activity is sheep    
 rearing.   The secondary activity is  
 growing cereals, mainly oats with some
 barley and wheat.   More oats are     
 grown here than any other part of     
 Sussex, or perhaps more than any other
 part of the south-east.   Some of the 
 farms also grow one or two vegetables 
 and early potatoes.                   
                                       
 One farm has four Charolais cows.   A 
 few of the farms have calves for      
 fattening but there are no dairy farms
 here.   Several of the farms have two 
 or three ponies for the family to     
 ride.   A livestock market is held    
 nearby in Rye.                        </content>
