		<content>   Arable farms  predominate.  The main
 crops being  wheat, barley and oilseed
 rape.  There  has  been an increase in
 the amount of fertiliser used so as to
 produce  optimum  yields.  The  use of
 insecticides  has  been  kept  down by
 using  crop  rotation  as  a  way  of 
 avoiding disease.                     
   Silage  is  produced  by those farms
 with cattle: they are grazed on fields
 near the river.  There  is one outdoor
 pig unit which  reflects the  changing
 methods of modern  farming as units of
 this  type  have  only  been developed
 during the last twenty years.         
   EEC regulations have reduced  cereal
 prices  but  local  farmers  have been
 fortunate  with  milk  quotas.  Wet   
 weather  in  June  this  year,  which 
 flattened  barley  and  spoilt much of
 the  hay, is thought to have  had more
 effect than the Common Market.        </content>
