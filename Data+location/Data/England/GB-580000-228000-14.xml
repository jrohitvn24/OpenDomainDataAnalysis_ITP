		<content> My favourite {Playground games }are   
 French skipping and Red Rover.{French 
{skipping}is a girls game really. Two  
 people have to get a long loop of     
 elastic and stand facing one another  
 with the elastic round their ankles.  
 You have to jump the lines. If you    
 tread on the lines of elastic you are 
 out and it is the next persons go. You
 have to do it all on anklesy, kneesy, 
 and thighsy and then anklesy, hopsy,  
 linesy, thinsy and fatsy.             
 In{Red Rover}you have two sides of    
 five or more. One side calls out a    
 persons name and they have to run over
 to your side and you join hands and he
 or she has to try and get through your
 hands. If they do not get through they
 stay on your side. If they get through
 they take one of your side to their   
 side.
