		<content>  Most farmers keep Friesian cattle and
 cross their heifers  with  beef breeds
 such as  Herefords  but  other  calves
 are  pure Friesian. Where farmers keep
 beef  cattle they  normally  sell them
 when they reach 480-500Kg., mostly  at
 Oswestry market.Milk goes to Ellesmere
 dairy by bulk tanker.                 
  Over half of the land  is  grass with
 some for silage,some for strip grazing
 and some is more extensive. Some crops
 such as barley are mostly for feed but
 cash crops  such as rape, potatoes and
 sugar  beet are  grown. An interesting
 experiment  has  been the  small scale
 growing of maize but, so far, not very
 successfully.                         
  Mechanisation  has increased greatly,
 resulting in fewer farm workers. Small
 farmers  harvest grain and  beet using
 local specialist farm contractors,thus
 avoiding the purchase of costly plant.</content>
