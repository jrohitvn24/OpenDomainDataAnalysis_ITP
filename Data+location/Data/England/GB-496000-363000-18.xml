		<title>18R.A.F. POLICE - WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   The Corporal gets up around 6.00am, 
 puts the kettle on and has breakfast. 
 He then watches TVAM before shaving.  
   The Corporal leaves his house, just 
 across the road from the camp, at     
 about 7.00am. He enjoys his work      
 because but does not like it when he  
 arrives to find something has happened
 that he can do nothing about.         
   Much of the day is spent patrolling 
 the camp in his jeep. The policemen   
 are trained to fight and are armed but
 rarely have to use their guns. They   
 rely on intelligence reports of       
 imminent danger before stepping up    
 protection of the camp. In the case of
 a war alert the whole area for several
 miles around the camp may be isolated.
   Before entering the R.A.F. the      
 Corporal worked at the clothes        
 department at Debenhams. His son also 
 wants to be a policeman.              </content>
