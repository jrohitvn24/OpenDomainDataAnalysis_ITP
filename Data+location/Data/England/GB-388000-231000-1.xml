  Tewkesbury is a quaint old market    
 town that lies on the junction of the 
 rivers Severn and Avon. A Norman Abbey
 dominates the area and along with     
 Tewkesbury's many fine old black and  
 white buildings, the town has become a
 picturesque attraction for thousands  
 of tourists each year.                
  Tewkesbury lies close to the M.5     
 motorway,thus being ideally placed for
 easy access from most parts of the    
 country. The industrial areas of      
 Tewkesbury are kept away from the town
 centre,and therefore do not affect its
 olde worlde character.                
  The town lies in a region of         
 outstanding beauty with such areas as 
 the Cotswolds,the Vale of             
 Evesham,Cheltenham and Gloucester,and 
 the Forest of Deanbeing within easy   
 reach.                                </content>
