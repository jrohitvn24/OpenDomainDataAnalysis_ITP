		<title>10A Farmer's Day.</title>
		<content>  The day starts at 6 a.m.in the early 
 summer. There are calves to feed and  
 the poultry to let out and feed. This 
 is a job shared by husband and wife.  
  Next the dairy herd are brought up   
 from the fields for milking.By the    
 time the cows are milked and the      
 parlour swilled and cleaned it is     
 10.30 a.m. and time for a cooked      
 breakfast.                            
  At this time of year there is silage 
 to cut  and make and the hay to be    
 baled and stored. Silage making       
 continues until it is dark. The       
 farmer's wife is busy cleaning eggs   
 and preparing poultry for customers,  
 before doing her normal household     
 chores. By early evening the cows must
 be milked again.                      
  It is a hard life. The farmer's wife 
 said ,"You need to be brought up to it
 but I wouldn't change a thing."       </content>
