		<title>18Poynton Station</title>
		<content> Poynton Station opened on 1st         
 September, 1887.   It replaced an     
 earlier station built in Lostock Road 
 in 1845 by the London, Manchester and 
 Birmingham Railway. The present       
 station was built by the London       
 North_Western Railway Company. It has 
 first and second class waiting rooms,a
 station master's office, a porter's   
 rest-room and ticket office. There are
 canopies to provide covered portions  
 to the platforms.   The substantial   
 and elaborate nature of the buildings 
 is the result of the influence of Lord
 Vernon, the local landowner.   There  
 was a petition in 1979 to make the    
 station a listed building but this was
 not successful.                       
 It is a suburban station mainly for   
 commuters.
