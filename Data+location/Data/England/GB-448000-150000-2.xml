 Parts of the church building are 900  
 years old and it is the most imposing 
 building in the village. The present  
 incumbent is also responsible for the 
 parish church of the village of       
 Laverstoke. There is a graveyard which
 is still being used as a burial ground
 but not all the people in the village 
 who die are buried there. There are   
 many regular weekly services held,    
 most of them on Sunday. The Church    
 which is dedicated to St. Mary is the 
 only church in the village. There is a
 Methodist Chapel and other religious  
 groups use various halls in the       
 village except the Roman Catholics.   
 They use St. Mary's to celebrate Mass 
 every Sunday at 9 a.m. in a practical 
 example of the current ecumenical     
 movement.
