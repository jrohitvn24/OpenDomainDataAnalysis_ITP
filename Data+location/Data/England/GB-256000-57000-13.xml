		<content>   Cubs is for boys between the ages of
 eight and eleven.                     
   We wear a uniform which is a dark   
 green jumper, a green and yellow tie  
 and cap.                              
   To become a member you must know the
 Cub Law and Promise, all the animals  
 in the first chapter of the Jungle    
 Book and the Grand Howl.              
   The Law is:- A cub scout should     
 always do his best, think of others   
 before himself and do a good turn     
 every day. The Promise is:- I promise 
 that I will do my best to do my duty  
 to God and to the Queen, to help other
 people and to keep the Cub Scout Law. 
   At cubs we play games, make things  
 and have homework every week. The     
 activities go towards your awards -   
 bronze, silver and gold arrows. You   
 can also win red proficiency badges.
