		<title>07WOODBURY HILL AND FAIR</title>
		<content> Over 2000 years ago,Iron Age tribes   
 built a fort on Woodbury Hill.A long  
 time after an Anchoret's Chapel was   
 built there.There was a very deep well
  next to it.Legend says that a golden 
 tablet was once hidden there.Sick     
 people believed that if they drank the
 water on September 21st they would be 
 healed.The story goes that a traveller
 who sold cloth was caught in a storm  
 and dried his cloth by the well on    
 that day.He sold his cloth and so came
 back the next year.So the fair grew   
 up.Three hundred years ago it was one 
 of the biggest fairs in the south.It  
 lasted 5 days.The last fair was held  
 in 1951.The 1st day of the fair was   
 called Wholesale day the 2nd day was  
 Gentlefolk's day the 3rd day was      
 Allfolks day the 4th day was Sheepfair
 day and the last day was Pack and     
 Penny day.                            </content>
