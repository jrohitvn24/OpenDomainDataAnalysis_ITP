		<title>20Events in Yewdale</title>
		<content>    On May 24th 1985,{H.M. the Queen   
 visited Cumbria and passed through our
 block, stopping at{Tarn Hows}to meet  
 representatives of the National Trust;
 from there she went to{High Yewdale   
{Farm}to meet the tenant, Mr. Birkett, 
 and his family, who gave her an       
 insight into the workings of a fell   
 farm. Due to the heavy rain, a        
 demonstration of shearing a Herdwick  
 sheep had to be carried out under     
 cover. Her Majesty travelled along    
 Yewdale to Coniston, where the streets
 were lined with local schoolchildren. 
    The potential danger of the fells  
 was underlined by the search for a    
 missing woman who disappeared on      
 September 28th 1985. A number of      
{mountain rescue}teams combined in a   
 week-long search, aided by helicopter,
 until the body was found. This was but
 one incident of many over the years.  </content>
