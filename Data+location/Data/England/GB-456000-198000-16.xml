		<title>16HEALTH AND BEAUTY FARM</title>
		<content>The farmhouse of Little Baldon Farm has
been converted to a non-residential    
beauty farm. It provides excercise,and 
beauty treatments. It is not a club,   
anyone may make an appointment.        
There is a gymnasium with weight       
lifting and excercise gear. Nearby is a
sauna and shower. The oak floored      
dining-room is used for keep-fit.      
Upstairs is a hairdresser,solarium and 
steam-bath. There is a massage room    
with an expert masseuse and beauty     
rooms for facials, make-up, pedicures  
and manicures.                         
The house,parts of which are Tudor, has
maintained much of its original        
character and sits in immaculate walled
gardens.
