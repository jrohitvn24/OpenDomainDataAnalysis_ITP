		<title>07The Manor House</title>
		<content> This is now a private residence,      
 Previously owned by British Steel and 
 used for administration. It is thought
 it was built as a Royal shooting box  
 in the 15 C.  It would have been      
 situated with the rest of the village 
 in a clearing in{Rockingham Forest. } 
 In the first half of the 16 C {Edward 
{,son of Thomas Montague}was born at   
 Brigstock and later became {Speaker of
{the House of Commons.}One of his      
 younger sons was known as Roger of    
 Brigstock and it was to him and his   
 heirs for ever that James I was       
 granted the manor of Brigstock.  Roger
 died without issue and the manor      
 passed to his nephew Sir Edward       
 Montague. The property was surrounded 
 by a moat fed by the waters of{Harpers
{Brook, }which flows through the       
 garden. The moat is in a good state of
 preservation.                         </content>
