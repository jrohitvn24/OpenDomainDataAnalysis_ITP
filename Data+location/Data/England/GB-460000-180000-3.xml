		<title>03Goring &amp; Streatley Station</title>
		<content>In 1887 the new Goring station was     
built.It only had two tracks and one   
platform.Just before the second world  
war started two more tracks,two more   
platforms and a footbridge across the  
railway were added.The station master  
has worked thirty five years for       
British Rail and has two               
assistants.About twenty three trains   
which stop at Goring on weekdays are   
going to Reading and twenty five  to   
Didcot.On weekdays 384 trains(stopping 
and nonstopping)go through Goring but  
only thirty on Sundays.On weekdays 520 
people go on trains to Reading and a   
hundred go to Didcot.If you buy a      
season ticket to London it costs 1255  
pounds.Fifty years ago there was a     
coal yard with sidings leading into it 
at Goring and eighteen people worked   
there.
