		<title>16MURDER IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> There is a hole in a hedge known as   
 Bodger's Gap. In 1911 young Mr Bodger 
 took an axe and chopped up his father 
 in Long Yard. When a Mr Ford tried    
 to stop him, he was chopped up too,   
 and the murderer fled through the gap.
 Much blood was spilt, and nothing has 
 grown since at this place in the      
 hedge.                                
 The investigators must have had a hard
 time as a local motto tends to be     
 'Never know narthing (nothing)'.
