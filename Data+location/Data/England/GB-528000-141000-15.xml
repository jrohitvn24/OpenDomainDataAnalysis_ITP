		<title>15WORK IN THE HORLEY AREA</title>
		<content> Whilst the national unemployment      
 figure stands at an average of 13.3%  
 with some northern and rural areas    
 considerably higher, that in Horley is
 well below average at only 5.3%, this 
 figure being maintained during the    
 last two years. Several factors have  
 led to this advantage. The location of
 Horley on a main railway line only 30 
 miles from London, with the use of    
 Gatwick Station, serving the airport, 
 has led to its development as a       
 commuter town, whilst the rapid       
 development of Gatwick has provided   
 employment to thousands of people both
 at the airport and in work related,   
 providing the services and amenities  
 of an ever expanding community. Few   
 people living in the Horley are       
 without at least one member of their  
 family whose work has some connection 
 with Gatwick and its services.        </content>
