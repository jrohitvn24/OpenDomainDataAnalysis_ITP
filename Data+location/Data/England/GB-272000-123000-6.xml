		<content>{Impressions of Bishops Nympton School.
   I have been going to Bishops Nympton
 School for nearly a year now,on       
 Thursday mornings.Along with seven    
 others from different schools,I am    
 taught by Mrs Wraighte.We do projects 
 on every day things like Transport and
 Weather.                              
   I find their slang weird and their  
 games odd,one of their games is called
 forward and back one team kicks away  
 from the goal,while the other team    
 tries to score.Ithink that the Bishops
 Nympton kids are lucky because they   
 have stilts &amp; the geodomes.In fine    
 weather,play is on the field where    
 there are some tyres and a football   
 pitch.                                
    When I first went to the school I  
 thought I was going to be teased. I   
 was by my old class but not by my new 
 class.{By Giles WESTAWAY.             </content>
