		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE BLOCK</title>
		<content> This block is within the Tyne and Wear
 conurbtion:a typical urban area based 
 on long established industries which  
 are now in decline.  The R.Tyne flows 
 through this block which is about     
 eight kilometres from the coast.  The 
 land is gently sloping although the   
 immediate sides of the rivers are     
 steep.                                
 The economic growth of the area was a 
 result of the development of the      
 Northumberland and Durham.  Coalfield 
 and the rivers as a means of transport
 and trade.                            
 The block is with in the N.E. regancy 
 of England.  This region has          
 traditonaly had a very strong local   
 identity via dialect, customs, jobs   
 and social and economic problems.
