		<title>03Mr Pleece's Farm: Background</title>
		<content>    The{farmhouse}that Mr. Pleece lives
 in is  quite  new. The old farmhouse  
 was 250 years old but now has been    
 converted into three houses. The new  
 house was about 100 yards from the old
 one. Most of the farm (50 acres in    
 total) is now being leased. From March
 25th to December 25th for Â£70 an acre,
 Mr. Pleece sells his grass for other  
 people to use.                        
   When Mr. Pleece did more{farming    
 himself the farm was a{dairy}one. Now 
 though, heonly has 15 cows as none of 
 his sons want to take over the farm at
 the moment.

   Mr. Pleece himself doesn't grow any 
{crops}except for a small amount of    
 hay for his cows.                     </content>
