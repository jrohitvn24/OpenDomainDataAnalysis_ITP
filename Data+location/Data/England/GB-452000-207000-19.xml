		<content>  The{Rev. Rimmer}is the{Parish Vicar} 
 for{Old Marston.}His church,{St.}     
{Nicholas'}is the church that{Oliver}  
{Cromwell}used to keep watch over the  
 Royalist troops during the{Civil}     
{War.}He is a very busy man who apart  
 from conducting services, visits the  
 old and sick.                         
  When asked if anything{embarrassing} 
 had happened during his services, he  
 replied, "A visiting ringer once went 
 up on the end of the bellrope ... A   
 preacher with his leg in plaster fell 
 up the pulpit stairs, as the choir    
 sang, 'Let not my slippery footsteps  
 slide, and hold me lest I fall' ... A 
 bride fainted{3}times during her      
 marriage ... and the organ caught fire
 at the end of a children's service!"
