		<content> We asked their opinion about the      
difference between state and private   
schools.They believed that private     
schools probably provided a better     
academic education but that it was     
geared too much towards examinations.  
They thought that they had a better    
general education with more varied     
topics which prepared them better      
for the world outside school.A state   
school was better socially.They hoped  
toget 8 "O"levels and get a good job   
or go on to do "A" levels and go       
to university. They believed that      
everybody should get a "fair"          
education and that the privileged      
sector of society should not get a     
better education.They would not want   
to go to a private school and would    
not send thier children to a private   
school.
