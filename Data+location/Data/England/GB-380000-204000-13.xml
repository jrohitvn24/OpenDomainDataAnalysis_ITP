		<content> Many children and adults spend their  
 leisure at a "Leisure Centre".  A     
 leisure centre is a complex of        
 buildings where people can take part  
 in various sports such as Badminton,  
 Tennis, Rollerskating, Putting and    
 Swimming.  There are two swimming     
 pools and a bar only open to adults.  
 At home a lot of adults do Gardening, 
 Do-it-Yourself and watch television.  
 Some take part in sports such         
 as Football, Rugby and Cricket.  Some 
 have hobbies - stamp collecting,      
 photography, crafts and breeding      
 birds.  Most children watch television
 at some time of the day.
