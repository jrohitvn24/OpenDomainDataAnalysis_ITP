		<title>15Flower Festival, Eaglesfield</title>
		<content> At{St Philip's Church,}a{flower       
{festival}was held between{25th}and    
{28th May.}Every window had a different
 scene.The porch had a hamper with     
 flowers from the garden in it and     
 stone boots with blue bells and       
 greenery.I liked where the flowers had
 been arranged as if they were falling 
 out of the font. At the ends of the   
 pews were little circles of flowers . 
 The altar flowers were red and white  
 and represented{Pentecost.}At the side
 wild blooms were the{Quaker's}flowers.
 Beside that was a{hunting scene.}A fox
 and a mink, a group of carved walking 
 sticks and a huntsman's coat were in  
 the corner.There was a{farming        
 arrangement and,at the back of the    
 church was{'Great Grandma's Kitchen'. 
 On the window opposite the door,the   
 theme was{John Dalton.}The best       
 display was about{Pitcairn Island.    </content>
