 Ganger Farm is used for growing pick  
 your own fruit and vegetables and for 
 breeding beef cattle. The farm covers 
 a total of 143 acres set out so: 25   
 acres rough grazing; 15acres fruit and
 veg.; 21 acres barley; 13 acres       
 woodland and the rest grass. 80 head  
 of cattle are kept on the farm. 60-70 
 of these go to Salisbury or Winchester
 market or straight to the slaughter   
 house. The soil is clay over gravel   
 and due to a valley drainage is       
 natural. Every year 500,000-800,000   
 gallons of water are used on the      
 crops. This is pumped from reading    
 beds by a deisel pump. Many different 
 machines are used on the crops such   
 as: hay bailers, cabbage planters, and
 ratovaters. The crops are sprayed and 
 the cattle are innoculated annually.
