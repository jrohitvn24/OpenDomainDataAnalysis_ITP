 people, some to work in an office,    
 others to work in a yard. They sell   
 soils for growers and for sports field
 use, cricket wickets, bowling greens, 
 golf courses, football pitches, rugby 
 grounds and tennis courts including   
 Wimbledon.                            
    They supply soil and compost to all
 parts of the country. The plant       
 includes five delivery lorries, five  
 tractors and three loading shovels.   
 There is also specialised machinery   
 for shredding, sterilising, mixing,
