		<content> BCIRA, the British cast iron research 
 association is the largest industry   
 around the Rowney Green area.  The    
 company arrived at Rowney green in    
 1941, but the company was establlished
 in 1921.  The company's main building 
 and surounding buildings took up      
 fiften acres out of 270 acres.  The   
 company has expanded since the first  
 buildings, a new block was built in   
 1962 for science research into cast   
 metals.  Some people had questioned   
 about the presence of gases and       
 pollution, which may harm the         
 countryside and the surrounding       
 wildlife,  produced by the chemicals  
 etc, which may be produced by the     
 smelting and other processes.
