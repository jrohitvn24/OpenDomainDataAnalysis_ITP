		<content> My mum and dad sometimes take our dog 
out for a walk on a Sunday. And other  
times they go out somewhere in our van 
in their spare time. I go to my friends
or to the swimming baths or I watch    
television, when I am bored. My nana   
and grandad go out to bingo on a       
Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday. My    
other nana and grandad do their garden 
on a Wednesday and a Sunday. They get a
lot of enjoyment ou of that. My uncle  
sometimes makes things out of wood and 
he makes some very nice things and he  
enjoys his work and my other relatives 
do all sorts of things.
