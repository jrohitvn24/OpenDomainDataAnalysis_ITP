		<content>        In our area it was found that  
 Catherine Cookson was the most popular
 writer but although this conclusion   
 was reached most people asked did not 
 have a preference.Next most popular   
 were Steve Jackson,Douglas Reeman     
 Thomas Hardy, Wilbur Smith,Richard    
 Adams,Kenneth Graham,Alastair Mclean  
 and James Herriot.                    
        Romantic novels,thrillers and  
 biographies seemed to be the favourite
 types of books amongst adults - with  
 children the new adventure/game book  
 is becoming increasingly popular      
        The reading of daily newspapers
 appears to be on the decline.Those who
 read one are in the minority according
 to our survey.The tabloids,notably THE
 SUN,was most popular.On Sunday,the    
 "heavier"papers did better with THE   
 SUNDAY TIMES prominent.
