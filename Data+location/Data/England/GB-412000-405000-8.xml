		<content>  The two most popular playground      
 games:                                
  The infants like to play{Star Wars   
 best. For this game you have to       
 pretend to be characters from the film
 "Star Wars". Everyone goes around     
 chasing each other and having battles.
 They pretend to have guns and shoot   
 each other and then they pretend to be
 dead. The girls just run around       
 screaming or getting chased by the    
 boys.                                 
{ Skipping games}The children see how  
 long they can skip with a skipping    
 rope and they do skipping patterns as 
 well. The children use the skipping   
 ropes for playing horses. A lot of    
 children play skipping and there is   
 one game were you jump off the rope   
 and say a colour. If you guess the    
 right colour then you have a turn.
