		<title>05FARMING - CROPS</title>
		<content> Park Farm is a mixed arable farm and  
 the crops are wheat and barley, sugar 
 beet and maize for maize sillage to   
 feed the bull beef reared. The        
 proportions are two thirds corn to    
 about one third beet.                 
 We enjoyed a ride in a landrover to   
 look at the crops. The average field  
 size  is 45 acres and yielded 3.5 tons
 per acre last year, a record. We saw a
 field of winter wheat which had been  
 in the ground for 11 months,          
 fertilized three times, sprayed five  
 times and intended for turkey feed.   
 The maize we saw would be chopped up, 
 blown into an air-tight silo (14 years
 old) and fed to cattle. The sugar beet
 should be lifted aboyt the 3rd week in
 September.
