		<title>06PRUDHOE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> One of the major employers in Prudhoe 
 is Prudhoe Hospital for mentally      
 disturbed people. The Hospital, which 
 caters for 1000 patients, aged between
 5 and 75, consists of approximately   
 50 different homes, each with their   
 own dormitories and bathroom. Each    
 home has facilities for cooking,      
 washing and a staffroom.              
   Nurses work shift work - three      
 days on then three days off. Therefore
 if a nurse is working one Tuesday then
 that nurse will work on the following 
 two Saturdays. Apart from the nurses/ 
 charge nurses, there are also domestic
 staff who are employed very cheaply.  
   In Prudhoe Hospital, apart from the 
 homes, there are also independant     
 homes where patients whose condition  
 has improved dramatically prepare for 
 independant life in society.
