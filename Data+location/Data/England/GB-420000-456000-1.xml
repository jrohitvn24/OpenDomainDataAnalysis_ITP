		<title>01Kettlesing Area - A Panorama</title>
		<content>   This is a 3 x 4 km. area of rolling 
 hillsides, cut by moorland becks,     
 e.g., Tang Beck. The moor rises to    
 over 230 metres at Menwith Hill. It is
 approx. 6 miles NW of Harrogate; the  
 A59 cuts through the block W to E.    
   It is a rural area, mainly agricul- 
 tural especially dairying, with sheep-
 farming on the higher land, and inter-
 spersed with natural and planted      
 woodlands, mainly deciduous.          
   It is an area of scattered hamlets, 
 centred on Kettlesing, but            
 encompassing High Birstwith and Men-  
 with Hill, its population engaged in  
 agriculture or commuting to jobs in   
 the Harrogate area.                   
   The M.O.D./U.S. communications      
 station at Menwith Hill lies in the   
 western quarter of the block. This is 
 a self-contained base of resident U.S.
 citizens.                             </content>
