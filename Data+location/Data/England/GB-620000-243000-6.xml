subscription fee of 117.50 Pounds apart
from  the  first  year  of joining when
they have to pay 190 Pounds.           
Non-members  are  allowed  to play on a

expensive with different  machines  for
cutting the rough grass,  the  fairways
and thee greens.   Water sprinklers and
fertilizers are also used  to  maintain
the condition of the golf course.      </content>
