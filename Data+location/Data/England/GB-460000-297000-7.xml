		<content>{A Typical Day}                        
 I get up at approximately 7.30am every
 schoolday.I have a wash,wash my       
 hair then go downstairs.I cook my     
 breakfast,two slices of toast and a   
 cup of coffee,I then set my school-bag
 for the day ahead.At 8.00am my friend 
 calls for me and we talk about what   
 happened the night before.At 8.15am   
 I call on a boy over the road and we  
 walk to school.We wait at the shop    
 Lanes for our other friends and then  
 we walk the rest of the way to school.
 After school I wait at Lanes for my   
 friends and then walk home.I reach my 
 house about 4.15pm.I get changed into 
 some much nicer fashionable clothes   
 and go round to my friend's           
 house.After tea at 6.30pm I either go 
 to the Boys Club,Uplands Park or I    
 invite friends into my house.I go to  
 bed around 10.30pm.                   </content>
