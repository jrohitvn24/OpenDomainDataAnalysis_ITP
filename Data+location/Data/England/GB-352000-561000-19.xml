		<content> north of the town again of brick      
 semi-detached houses with gardens. In 
 1960, a small block of flats was built
 close to the town centre. It is only  
 three storeys high and brick built    
 with a rendered and painted exterior. 
 The latest development of housing is a
 small estate of light-coloured brick  
 and flat-roofed houses built in small 
 terraces with a large green in the    
 middle and a network of footpaths.    
 Privately owned housing is to be found
 in small developments on the outskirts
 of town, in three directions. It      
 consists of detached and semi-detached
 houses with garages and small         
 gardens.Interspersed with the old     
 stone houses and the modern housing   
 estates are pockets of Victorian      
 terraced housing made from red        
 brick with very small garden to the   
 front and small yards to the rear.    </content>
