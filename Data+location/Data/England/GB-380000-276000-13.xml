 When we went to the Leisure Centre a  
 man called Roger gave us some safety  
 hats to wear. we went to look at the  
 pool - it was fantastic! When it is   
 finished there will be a big slide    
 like a helter-skelter with water      
 sliding down, and a big whale in the  
 shallow end with water coming out of  
 its spout. We went to look at the     
 squash courts from above and the bar, 
 cafe and fire exit. It was a very big 
 building with an arched roof. I can't 
 wait till it's open because I want to 
 slide down the slide and have a good  
 swim.
