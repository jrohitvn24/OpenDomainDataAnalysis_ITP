		<title>01Review of Bookham &amp; Fetcham</title>
		<content> This Block lies on the dip slope of   
 the North Downs between the heavy clay
 landscape of{Bookham Common}in the NW 
 and the chalk of{Fetcham Down}in the  
 SE.{Leatherhead}is just to the NE and 
 the A246 joins this town to the       
 villages of Fetcham, Gt.&amp; Lt. Bookham 
 and Effingham and continues westward  
 towards{Guildford.}                   
 1985 marked the centenary of the      
 opening of Bookham station on the     
 Leatherhead to Effingham Junction     
 line. In 1985 the M25 motorway is to  
 be opened just to the N of the area.  
 London is within 25 miles and the area
 is predominantly part of the commuter 
 or "gin &amp; tonic" belt. The{Green Belt}
 starts at the W edge of the block.    
 Plenty of open spaces exist N and S of
 the houses. Bookham Common is owned by
 the {National Trust}and{Norbury Park} 
 by Surrey County Council.             </content>
