		<content> The bus service in our area is run by 
{West Midlands Passenger Transport.}We 
 have two types of buses. We have      
{single deckers}which hold 43          
 passengers and{double deckers}which   
 hold 76 passengers. Adults pay full   
 fare but children pay half fare       
 between the age of 4 and 16 but{Old   
{Age Pensioners}travel free with a bus 
 pass. You can get{Daytripper tickets  
 from the{Enquiries Office}which are   
 75p for children and Â£1.75 for adults,
 which will enable you to travel       
 anywhere in the{West Midlands.}You    
 must have the correct fare to put in  
 the slot when you get on a bus. The   
 driver scans it, if it is correct a   
 ticket comes out of a machine. The    
 buses run from about 5.00 am to about 
 12.00am for seven days a week         
 throughout the year.
