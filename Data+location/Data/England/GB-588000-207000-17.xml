		<title>17THE BENTALL PLOUGH</title>
		<content> In the late eighteenth century        
 William Bentall established his       
 engineering works in Goldhanger.At    
 first he only mae small items for his 
 own farm and those of his neighbours, 
 but around the turn of the century he 
 was able to expand his business and he
 was forced to move to new premises in 
 the nearby river town of Heybridge.The
 reason for this expansion was the     
 invention of what became known as the 
 "Bentall Plough".He managed to find a 
 way of successfully bolting the cast  
 iron plough to the wooden frame and   
 created a plough which was more       
 durable than itd predecessors.The fame
 of the plough spread throughout East  
 Anglia and the expression "to bentall 
 the land" was in common use.The firm  
 remained in Heybridge until l984 when 
 it was forced to close thus closing a 
 chapter in the history of the area.   </content>
