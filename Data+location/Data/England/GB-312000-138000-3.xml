		<content>     Much of the charm of this wooded  
 combe surrounded by moorland has its  
 origin in history. The{oaks}were      
 coppiced every forty years for{bark   
{for The Tannery _}now known as the    
{Combe House Hotel,}while the{wood}was 
 burned on the hills for{charcoal}which
 was made into{gunpowder.}             
    The{Orchards of Combe House Hotel }
 were originally{Enclsures.}When a     
 severe economic depression caused a   
 food shortage  small areas of the     
{Quantock Common}were enclosed by the  
 people to grow crops.                 
      The{Tanyards}27 foot{water wheel 
 is still part of Combe House. After   
 the Tanyard closed it drove a{dynamo} 
 which supplied{light}to Combe House It
 also powered a stone cracker in the   
 quarry,a chaff-cutter and circular    
 saws and continued to work until 1953
