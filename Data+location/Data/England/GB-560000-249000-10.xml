		<content>     All aspects of government affect  
 this area although the national and   
 regional decisions seem remote when   
 read about in the newspapers. Current-
 ly local County and District (South   
 Cambridgeshire) councillors both live 
 in nearby villages and regularly      
 attend the local Parish council meet- 
 ings and seem to be helpful.They have 
 less to do here as this is a rural    
 area with limited facilities and only 
 two small population centres.There is 
 a very high proportion of council     
 housing in West Wickham(40 houses in a
 population of 350).In both of the     
 villages covered there is a wish by   
 the District Council to build a few   
 bungalows for old people, which would 
 vacate some of the larger houses for  
 families.All the government offices   
 and Social Service departments are a  
 few miles away in the towns.          </content>
