		<content> Running North/South through the centre
 of our area is the busy dual          
 carriageway A38, built a few years ago
                                       
 to link the M1 and the A5. The volume 
 of traffic  on this road has led to   
 repairs already and a high noise      
 level. Slower_moving traffic, more    
 local traffic, uses mainly the A61    
 Ripley_Derby road and the A609        
 Belper_Ilkeston. The area is          
 well_served by public transport, not  
 all homes possessing a car and there  
 being a significant proportion of     
 elderly residents. There is no public 
 railway service in the area, Belper   
 being the nearest station. There is a 
 small mineral railway which has a     
 small number of trains daily.
