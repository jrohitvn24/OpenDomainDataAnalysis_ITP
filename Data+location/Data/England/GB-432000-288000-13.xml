		<title>13BEING ILL</title>
		<content>  My name is Deena Morgan.I am eleven  
 years old,and I have just recovered   
 from tonsilitis.Tonsilitis is a throat
 infection.When you get it you have a  
 high temperature,but you feel         
 cold.I went to bed and my mum gave me 
 a Locket which she had bought from the
 shop.Lockets are sweets,but they have 
 a kind of medicine inside them.The    
 next day I had to go to the doctors.A 
 doctor is a person you go to see if   
 you are ill,and he gives you tablets  
 or medicine.Medicine is a liquid that 
 makes you better.Tablets are little   
 hard cubes of medicine,but mostly they
 are round.I had medicine which was    
 yellow and it tasted nice.Most        
 medicines taste horrible!I had to take
 my medicine three times a day.I had   
 two days off school,but now I'm back  
 thanks to the doctor.I still have to  
 take medicine to make sure I'm well.  </content>
