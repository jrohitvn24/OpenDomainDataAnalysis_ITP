		<title>13WILDLIFE OF BARLING</title>
		<content> Barling is a good place for wildlife. 
 There are many different kinds of     
 birds to be found here.  Many         
 marshland birds, ducks and geese come 
 to the creeks particularly in winter. 
 There is often a kestrel hovering over
 the fields. There is a heronry in     
 Barling. This year it had 4 nests.    
 When we went there we found some      
 bones. We saw a baby heron being fed. 
 Lee and Ryan saw one eating an eel. In
 1982 many herons were killed by       
 farmers because they ate their fish.  
 The R.S.P.B. wished to protect the    
 birds. They  made a survey and found  
 that by making the banks of the fish  
 lakes vertical it would make the      
 herons leave them alone as they like  
 to wade in shallow water. Barling is  
 also good place to find animals like  
 foxes. There is even a coypu near the 
 creek.                                </content>
