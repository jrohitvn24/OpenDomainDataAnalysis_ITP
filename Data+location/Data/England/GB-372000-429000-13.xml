  The new road through Church linking  
Accrington with the M65 was opened     
recently. Traffic lights have been     
installed where the road crosses Dill  
Hall Lane.                             
  270000 pounds has been spent this    
year on replacing an 80 year old sewer.
The new 75 cm pipes will carry more    
sewerage and will prevent overflows    
which used to pollute the River        
Hyndburn. The extra capacity will allow
the area to be developed further.      
  The Elderly Sick and Mentally Infirm 
are now catered for in the new E.S.M.I.
unit at Accrington Victoria Hospital.  
The children's ward has not been so    
lucky however - it has been closed     
down.
