		<title>06FRILSHAM-MARLSTON LIFESTYLES</title>
		<content> Marlston lies south of Frilsham. It is
 really a hamlet and is the centre of  
 the{Marlston estate}which belonged to 
 the{Palmer family}who owned all the   
 land thereabouts. Its name was first  
 recorded as{Martels Manor.}It is much 
 smaller than Frilsham. Round the      
 church in the grounds of what was     
 Marlston Manor are the cottages once  
 lived in by the{estate workers}and now
 separately sold off. Many workers are 
 buried in the churchyard and also     
 commemorated in the church. In the old
 days{girls}went from school to work at
 the Manorhouse or Hawkridge House till
 they{married the men}who worked on the
 farms all their lives. Now there are  
 few domestics or farm workers. The    
 little Norman church of Saint Mary is 
 now a parish church where where       
 Brockhurst School boys sing in the    
 choir.                                </content>
