		<content>  Services that are taken for granted  
 by town dwellers are sometimes non-   
 existent in the country areas.        
  There are no schools here and child- 
 ren have to travel by bus provided by 
 the local authority.This applies to   
 both primary and secondary schools.   
  Public transport is available along  
 the A49.As this is only at two-hourly 
 intervals between morning and early   
 evening,even shopping can be a major  
 problem.                              
  The W.R.V.S. provide a welcome       
 service to the elderly but all medical
 services are provided by the Health   
 Centre in Church Stretton.All mail is 
 delivered once daily.                 
  There are no cinemas,theatres or any 
 other public entertainment centres.All
 social activities are provided by the 
 villagers themselves.
