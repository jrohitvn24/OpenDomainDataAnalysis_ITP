		<content>The debate about the local {by-pass}   
has gone on for years.A choice is to be
made soon from three possible routes.  
One would pass through the {trading    
estate},whilst two would pass through  
{strawberry fields}.Many fear that the 
choice will not be the local one.      
{Kids'games} will {change}-"We all     
pinched old Bert's apples, it wasn't   
the apples we were after.It was the    
chasing".Or - "Matches in one          
hand,sticks in the other, we moved     
slowly towards the wood" or -"Lets go  
{scrumping},you go in the back and I'll
keep lookout"."Off you go before I     
phone the police"."We were             
{cherry-knocking}.Me and my mate.We ran
away,got round the corner and started  
making faces at his door".Or - "We     
trespassed on a farmer's land.He saw   
us and came after us with a club".
