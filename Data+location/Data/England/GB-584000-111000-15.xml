		<content> There are four hotels, four public    
 houses, one restaurant and one cafe   
 in the Fairlight area of East Sussex. 
 All of the pubs have eating           
 facilities, two of them have          
 'restaurant' rooms.  These facilities 
 are well used by local residents all  
 year as well as visitors during the   
 summer months.                        
                                       
 The four garages not only provide for 
 the high percentage of the population 
 who own cars, but also the tourists   
 who come here from Easter to September
                                       
 Another local trade which depends on  
 tourism for it's success is the       
 roadside farmshop.  There are three in
 this area;  one on the main Hastings  
 to Rye road and benefits from through 
 traffic, and two on the scenic coastal
 route, Fairlight Road.                </content>
