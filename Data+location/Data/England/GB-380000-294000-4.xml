		<title>04CLIMATE IN THE SEISDON AREA</title>
		<content>   The climate of this district is     
quite normal for the west midlands  of 
England, rarely going to any extremes. 
Frost and snow do regularly occur in   
winter, the latter  tending to drift   
easily because of the flat ground and  
the strong winds which often sweep     
across the area, encouraged no doubt   
by the lie of the land.   The main road
is kept clear of snow but it can be a  
problem sometimes in the narrow lanes. 
   Rainfall is not very high, though   
probably average for this part of the  
country.   In drier summers some       
farmers irrigate their crops           
continuously.
