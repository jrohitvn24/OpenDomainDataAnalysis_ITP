		<title>05Communications in Laindon</title>
		<content>  The area is divided by the A127      
London to Southend road which is a busy
commuter and holiday route. This has   
been joined to Britain's motorway      
system 10 miles further west where it  
meets the M25.                         
  A new road, West Mayne, has been     
built to link the industrial estate to 
the A127. It is hoped to attract       
industry to Laindon to provide more    
employment.                            
  By contrast, the roads to the north  
of the A127 are country lanes serving  
the few farms to be found in this      
sector of the block. These minor roads 
are quite narrow and winding but they  
carry alot of traffic at peak times.
