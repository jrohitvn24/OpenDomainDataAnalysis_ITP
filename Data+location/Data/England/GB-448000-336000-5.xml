		<content>   The block has only one real shopping
 centre, Stapleford. Bramcote has a    
 small shopping area which caters for  
 mainly small item shopping;whereas    
 the part of Chilwell in this block has
 almost no shops at all.               
   Though Stapleford has the largest   
 number of shops, residents still      
 prefer to do the main weekly shopping 
 at the new Sainsbury's supermarket in 
 Beeston, or the Co-op supermarket in  
 Toton.                                
   Many people complained of the lack  
 of choice when shopping in Stapleford,
 particularly concerning clothes.      
   Many people also regularly use      
 Ilkeston and Long Eaton as shopping   
 centres. Shopping trips into          
 Nottingham are more rare, whereas     
 Derby is almost totally ignored.
