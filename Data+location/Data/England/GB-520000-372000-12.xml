		<content> Later in the year individual and      
 family portraits are taken.We went to 
 Gibraltar Point for three days in the 
 winter.We studied wildlife on the     
 marshes and dunes.We saw how they ring
 birds and how they catch them too.We  
 go swimming for about seven times each
 year.We get distance badges for the   
 how many metres we do.Soon we are     
 going to Belton House for a day.We    
 shall take a packed lunch,and go to   
 the adventure playground.We will go   
 around the house and go on nature     
 trail.The nurse comes to check our    
 hair every so often.If necessary she  
 gives you some special shampoo.She    
 also has lately been to show us some  
 films about our bodies.Sports day is  
 held every year as well as a sponsered
 run.All this term we have been very   
 busy with the Domesday Project.
