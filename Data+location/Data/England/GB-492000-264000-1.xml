		<title>01LANDSCAPE AROUND IRCHESTER</title>
		<content>Our area lies on the southern flanks of
the valley of the River Nene,which is  
pronounced "Nen" locally.It is a gently
rolling landscape drained by several   
small streams flowing northwards into  
the Nene.                              
                                       
The area straddles the border between  
Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire.It   
comprises the village of Wymington in  
Bedfordshire,the much larger village of
Irchester and the western half of the  
town of Rushden,both of which are in   
Northamptonshire.Between the settle-   
ments are large open fields used almost
entirely for arable farming.           
                                       
The main London to Leicester railway   
line runs through the area and two     
major roads,the A45 and the A6,pass    
through the margins of the area.
