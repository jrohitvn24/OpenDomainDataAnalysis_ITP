 has a sauna. The pool is used by 3000 
 people a week with 2000 school        
 children having weekly swimming       
 lessons. Close by is the Civic Hall   
 where films are shown, plays produced 
 and meetings held. Its restaurant is  
 open during the day. In addition to   
 books the library lends records and   
 music tapes. Some tapes contain       
 fiction books for listening to and
