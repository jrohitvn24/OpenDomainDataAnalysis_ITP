		<content> My name is M.Gibson. The year is 1985.
 On Monday 1st. July I got up at 7 a.m.
 washed and did my hair, then  dressed.
 When  I  got  downstairs,  my  brother
 Stephen  was leaving for work  on  his
 motor-bike.  I had breakfast, a  glass
 of milk and cup of tea,  then let Pep,
 my dog, outside.  I got my books ready
 for School, Jayne came and we went for
 the bus. We called for crisps and some
 "chuddy" on the way. The bus came at 8
 o' clock and we all got on and went to
 school at Silloth. We registered, then
 went to lessons.   First lesson for me
 was metalwork.   After break we worked
 on the{ Domesday Project.  }After that
 was P.E., when I practised putting the
 shot.  For lunch I bought a brown roll
 with cheese and solid cream - 37p.  At
 afternoon  assembly  we  talked  about
 'Openings Day'  activities.   For  the
 afternoon lesson, we had sci-mat.     </content>
