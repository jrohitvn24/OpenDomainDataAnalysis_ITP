		<content>   The Gorge is a deep ravine that     
 has been carved by the River Lyd      
 over thousands of years.It is about   
 2.5 miles long and averages 80feet    
 to 100 feet in depth.                 
   The National Trust owns the Gorge   
 and every year up to 80,000 visitors  
 come to see it.A Warden and his       
 Assistant and three full time workers 
 are employed and there are also three 
 part time workers.                    
   Once there were outlaws, called the 
 Gubbins,living in the Gorge,and before
 that,in Anglo-Saxon times,the Gorge   
 was used as a defence against the     
 Danes.                                
   There is a waterfall called "The    
 White lady" at one end of the Gorge   
 and among the rocks at the higher     
 end is a deep whirlpool called "The   
 Devil's Cauldron"
