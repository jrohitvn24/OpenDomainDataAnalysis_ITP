		<content>Good examples of typical Kentish       
architecture can be seen in the        
village. The long steep red-tiled roofs
of the nearby weavers cottages used to 
house their looms. The historic and old
beamed Star &amp; Garter hotel was once a  
monastic house near the tiny chapel of 
St.Mary, site of the ppresent church.  
The hotel has recently acquired the    
neighbouring pub for a restaurant      
extension. Spyways, next door, with an 
overhanging front is aptly named being 
a look-out for smugglers or the arrival
of the stagecoach. The large house     
opposite was a master weavers house,   
then barracks for troops during the    
Napoleonic wars, and a coffee tavern.  
The Rootes Motor Group had it's        
origins in the basement where William  
Rootes had a cycle repair shop in 1900.
A former oast in the village is the ex-
servicemen's club.                     </content>
