		<content> The village pub is called the Black   
 Bull. It sells Stones Beer, pies,     
 chips and other simple meals, snacks  
 such as crisps and peanuts and other  
 kinds of alcoholic drinks such as     
 wines and spirits. It has a beer      
 garden at the back for families to    
 use. Children under 14 are not allowed
 inside a pub.No one under 18 is       
 allowed to buy or drink alcoholic     
 drinks.                               
   The pub has a large car park which  
 is often full when the pub is open    
 despite laws against drinking and     
 driving.                              
   The shopping centre is very small.  
 All of the shops are within about     
 thirty metres of each other.          
   There is no footpath on one side of 
 the road near Yates' and the Black    
 Bull. This could be dangerous.
