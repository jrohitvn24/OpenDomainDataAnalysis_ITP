		<title>01LAND SOUTH EAST OF ALRESFORD</title>
		<content> This is an area of mixed farmland,    
 scattered houses and two villages,    
 Bishops Sutton in the North West and  
 Ropley Dean in the North East. The A31
 trunk road runs through the villages  
 and the River Arle rises East of      
 Bishops Sutton and Flows West through 
 meadows and watercress beds. The      
 highland to the South of the A31 is   
 farmland with large fields divided by 
 hedges, areas of wood and narrow lanes
 leading to hamlets and farms. There is
 a small area of grass common land     
 (Bramdean Common) at the southern     
 edge. Habitation is mainly along the  
 A31 and the road to Petersfield. The  
 buildings are mostly 20th Century but 
 include a few large Georgian and      
 Victorian residences and quite a lot  
 of old cottages. Farming employs a    
 small number of inhabitants, but most 
 travel daily to jobs in nearby towns. </content>
