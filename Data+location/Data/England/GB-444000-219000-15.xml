		<title>15TACKLEY PARK ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Tackley Park Estate}was built up since
 1950 when the Peak family bought Manor
 Farm in Tackley.  During the nineteen 
 fifties, 5 other farms were purchased 
 giving Tackley Park Estate{1270 acres}
 to farm. Until 1982 there was a{dairy 
{herd}at Hill Court Farm but the quotas
 introduced by the{European Common     
{Market}made this a financially poor   
 proposition. Some 500 sheep are kept  
 with the lambing season producing some
 800 lambs in a good season.{Arable    
{farming}fills the remaining fields:-  
 oil seed rape for cattle food, wheat  
 for bread making and barley being the 
 main crops. A limited amount of hay is
 made. 6 full-time workers are employed
 and an estate manager. The smallest   
 field is less than an acre while the  
 largest is 80 acres. Each field is    
 named-e.g.Pigeon's Field, Old Man Leys
 etc; some fields just have letters.   </content>
