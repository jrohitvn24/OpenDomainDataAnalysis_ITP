		<content> Most of the shops in the centre of    
 Hope have changed in the last century 
 and there are now fewer businesses.   
 The main shops are a greengrocers, a  
 butchers, two grocery stores plus a   
 Post Office and a Book/Craft shop.    
 There are two banks which only        
 open part time.                       
 Whilst Bradwell has a few more shops  
 than Hope most residents travel to    
 Sheffield for any major purchases.    
 Many will travel there each week even 
 for basic necessities.                
 Whilst most people travel by car, it  
 is possible to go by either train or  
 bus.  There are about four trains a   
 day in each direction and about six   
 buses.                                
 A bus travels to Bakewell each Monday 
 morning to take the villagers to the  
 large market held there each week.
