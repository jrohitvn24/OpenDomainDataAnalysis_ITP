		<title>19LYNE VILLAGE - THEN AND NOW</title>
		<content>     There have been many changes in   
 the village of Lyne during the last   
 fifty years, the most significant     
 being housing development.  Where     
 there were once green fields with a   
 few farm cottages there are now       
 houses, and although there is still a 
 small farming community the majority  
 of the inhabitants commute daily to   
 large towns.  Another significant     
 change is the disappearance of the    
 village shop and post office which    
 served as a meeting place for the     
 villagers.  The village school        
 although destroyed by fire on 5th     
 November l930 was rebuilt and has     
 remained unchanged apart from some    
 modernisation such as central heating 
 replacing open coal fires.  The       
 village Church has remained constant  
 throughout all this change and is now 
 the focal point of Lyne village life. </content>
