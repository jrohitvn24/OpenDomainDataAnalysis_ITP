		<content>{Housing.}All houses in the Meadowood  
 Estate have double garages and a      
 N.H.B.C 10 year protection.Some of the
 houses on the estate are The          
 Chatsworth,The Berford,The            
 Amberley,The Tonbridge and The        
 Malvern."Maidenhead" is located about 
 two and a half miles to the south west
 of the picturesque Berkshire town of  
 "Maidenhead" close to open            
 countryside.The Meadowood estate is   
 next to Cox Green.The houses in       
 Meadowood are made out of bricks.The  
 first house was built 4 years ago.    
 My family moved to the area because we
 like it and we have lived here before.
{Bedrooms.}I think that the sizes of   
 the bedrooms in our house are quite   
 good but I wouldn't mind if they were 
 a bit bigger. I would like another    
 room for sitting in when my friends   
 come round.                           </content>
