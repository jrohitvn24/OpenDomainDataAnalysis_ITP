		<content>   My mother-in Law is 81 years old.   
 She has to rely on me for transport to
 take her anywhere as she cannot walk  
 too far now. I take her every two     
 weeks to the Derby and Joan Club(a    
 club for old aged pensioners) in      
 Hamstreet, to the Women's Institute   
 meetings in Appledore once a month and
 to the "Good Companions" club also in 
 Appledore once a month. All of these  
 are clubs where she meets people for  
 two or three hours one afternoon and  
 they have people who come and give a  
 talk or demonstration on interesting  
 subjects. We also go out shopping     
 together once a week so that she can  
 get any shopping she requires.        
 Sometimes the clubs mentioned have    
 outings to various places and she goes
 out quite a bit on coach trips with   
 the people she meets at the clubs.
