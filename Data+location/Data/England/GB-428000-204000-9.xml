		<title>09DEANERY FARM NR. BAMPTON</title>
		<content> The farmer, his son and 2 employees   
 farm this 500 acre farm. They have a  
 herd of 90{Charollais}cows and rear   
 calves for{beef}. They also grow{     
{winter wheat and barley.}The cattle   
 are brought in out of the cold in     
 November and kept in a barn on straw. 
 The calves are born in February and   
 all the animals go out to grass in the
 Spring. The manure from the barn is   
 put out on the fields in Autumn.      
 Haymaking for Winter feed begins in   
 June/July and square bales are still  
 used as the farmer finds round bales  
 too large and heavy for the men to    
 lift. A{windpump}is used to provide   
 water for the fields. The farmhouse   
 was originally in{Bampton}but{public  
{pressure}from the village over the    
 farm's pigs persuaded the farmer to   
 move out of the present site. The old 
 farm buildings are converted to homes.</content>
