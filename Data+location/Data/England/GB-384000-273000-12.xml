		<title>12Building your own house.</title>
		<content>    We lived in a caravan for six      
 months while we built our own house.  
 It was cramped, with three children   
 and our parents.  Charlotte was only  
 two.  We had no water or electricity  
 in the van, and no TV.  Mum washed    
 outside with a tub and the mangle.  At
 night, the tables had to be folded    
 away before the beds were made.  Dad  
 did the foundations himself, and we   
 all poured in the hard-core.  In the  
 winter of '81, dad had to unfreeze the
 gas-bottle tap each morning.  The van 
 got wet and our things were damp.   We
 all wrote our names on our bedroom    
 walls before the floors were down.    
    All the children on the self-build 
 made dens with bricks and planks in   
 the mounds of dirt.  Some families are
 building second houses, but my mum    
 said "never again".
