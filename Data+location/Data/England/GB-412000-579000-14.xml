		<title>14WHALTON BAAL FIRE</title>
		<content> The most famous and unique annual     
 event in Whalton is the Baal or Bale  
 Fire. It is held on old midsummer eve,
 4th. July. The children of the village
 collect for and build an enormous     
 bonfire on the the village green just 
 east of the Beresford Arms. Local     
 teams of Morris Men dance in the      
 street before the fire is lit.        
 Recently the Baal Fire has been       
 followed by a Barn Dance in the       
 Village Hall with the proceeds going  
 to the church. Many people believe    
 that the origins of the fire lie in   
 pre-history and are concerned with a  
 pagan god, Baal. However, the Oxford  
 Dictionary states that Bale is derived
 from the Old English, Bael or the Old 
 Norse, Bal meaning a great fire.      
 During the black_out in the war a few 
 twigs were lit and quickly put out to 
 preserve the tradition.               </content>
