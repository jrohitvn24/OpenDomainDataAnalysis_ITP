		<content>   There are three places of Christian 
 Worship in Felsted.  Holy Cross Church
 dates from Norman times and contains a
 memorial to Lord Riche, First Earl of 
 Warwick, who founded Felsted School in
 1564.  The modern Chapel at Felsted   
 School maintains close links with the 
 Parish Church.                        
                                       
   Also in Felsted there is the United 
 Reformed Chapel which is a listed     
 building that has fallen into         
 disrepair and services are now held in
 what was previously the Church Hall.
