		<content>   We asked the children in our school 
 what kinds of jobs their Fathers and  
 Mothers had.  29% of Fathers were     
 unemployed. This was the largest      
 percentage. 15% were miners who       
 travelled to mines outside our block  
 on the map.  8% were mechanics. The   
 remaining numbers worked in a variety 
 of jobs which included drivers,       
 welders, bricklayers, joiners,        
 farmworkers and factory workers.      
   The largest percentage of Mothers   
 were housewives _ this being 57%. 14% 
 were machinists who worked at a       
 clothing factory on the local         
 industrial estate. The remainder      
 worked in a variety of occupations    
 which included domestic work, shop    
 assistants, canteen assistants,       
 nurses, secretaries and factory       
 workers.
