		<title>07SOFT FRUIT AT BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   Bere Ferrers used to be important   
 for strawberries, raspberries, black  
 and red cherries and gooseberries     
 etc.  Now the horticulture has        
 decreased considerably and trees have 
 even been planted in place of         
 orchards.  Most emphasis is on "pick  
 your own."  One lady takes the first  
 two weeks' crop to sell to the market 
 in Plymouth and whilst the "pick your 
 own"season is on,sells to the pickers.
   "It was a pleasant morning when we  
 picked our own.We began by walking    
 down a lane and on the right was the  
 produce shed.We were given some       
 punnets to collect our strawberries   
 in.Some people found huge strawberries
 : some were ripe and some were squashy
 and over-ripe.We had to bend down to  
 pick them and we decided we would not 
 like to pick all day for our living.My
 two punnets cost me 32p .             </content>
