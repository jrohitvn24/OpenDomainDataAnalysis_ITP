		<content>    Cressing Temple Farm is in the very
 northeast of our area and on the main 
 road between Braintree and Witham. It 
 has 666 acres and is up for sale at   
 the moment for{Â£2,000,000.}At one time
 it included about one thousand acres. 
    The history of the farm goes back a
 very long way to the days of the      
 Knight Templars who were given land by
 the king to provide them with money to
 help to get to the Holy Land and      
 Jerusalem. The land they were given   
 was known as a manor and others in    
 Essex were at Little Maplestead and   
 near Tilbury. The land grew crops and 
 these were stored in two very large   
 barns which are still in use today and
 are known as the Wheat Barn and the   
 Barley Barn. They also had the right  
 to tithes (which means tenths) from a 
 wider area.
