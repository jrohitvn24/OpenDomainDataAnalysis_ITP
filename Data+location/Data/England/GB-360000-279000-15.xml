		<title>15SHEEP ON THE COMMON.</title>
		<content>{RICHARD SAYS, }"Sheep on the          
 common are not looked after properly  
 because there's not enough grass to   
 graze on. They're all thin and tatty."
                                       
{Matthew says,}"The sheep on the common
 are malnourished . Farmers don't seem 
 to bother about their sheep. they     
 should take all the sheep off for a   
 few months to give the grass a chance 
 to grow. The council should do        
 something about this problem, I think 
 that the council  should be more      
 strict. Susans Dad does not approve of
 the sheep on the common. Kevins Dad   
 puts sheep on the common but Rich and 
 I do not approve."                    
    By Richard and Matthew.
