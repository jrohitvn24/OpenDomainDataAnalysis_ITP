		<content>Acres Open Space Children's Play Area. 
  About 15 years ago there was no play 
area at all in Gnosall. Some children  
played on the road. About 10 years ago 
a property developer gave 26 acres to  
the Parish Council to be made into a   
play and recreation area. The Parish   
Council made a play area about 5 years 
ago  and more recently an adventure    
playground.                            
  It took a lot of money to develop the
play area. The slide cost 1000 pounds; 
the swings 800 pounds; the climbing    
frame 500 pounds; the seat 150 pounds  
and the litter bin 30 pounds. Mounds of
surplus soil were put round the play   
area to keep out the wind.             
  The Parish Council has cut the grass 
and planted trees to create a village  
green. Dogs must be kept on a lead.    
There is no cycling or playing with    
boats on the brook.                    </content>
