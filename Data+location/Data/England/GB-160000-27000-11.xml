		<title>11TIN MINING (2)</title>
		<content>     The miners,however,were grateful  
 to Grylls for preserving their jobs   
 and when Grylls died 2,386 people     
 contributed money for the purchase of 
 a memorial arch to him at the bottom  
 of Coinagehall Street in Helston.     
                                       
     Between 1840-1850 1,200-1,400     
 people were employed in the mine. By  
 1837 2,638 blocks of tin had been     
 smelted (a block is about three       
 hundredweight). Output sometimes      
 reached 220 tons of block tin a month 
 when the average price of tin was Â£83 
 a ton. The deepest shaft in the mine  
 was at a depth of 266 fathoms.        
                                       
     In 1847 the mine was abandoned and
 "great distress was felt in the       
 neighbourhood and grass grew in the   
 streets of Helston" - an illustration 
 of how important the mine was.        </content>
