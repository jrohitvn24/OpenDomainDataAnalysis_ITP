		<content> Each year, the Laverstock Village Fete
 Committee, representing most of the   
 Clubs and societies - and the Church -
 at Laverstock, organise its annual    
 Fete during the month of June. This   
 has happened each year since 1977.    
 This year they helped raise funds for 
 the Blood Cell Seperator to help in   
 the fight against leukaemia. Over the 
 years over Â£3000 has been raised for  
 hospital associated projects. Money   
 though very impotant, is not the      
 committee's main concern.{It exists to
{give the village a Family Day Out.    
 There was this year, the traditional  
 Fancy Dress procession from the       
 village green and led by the Shrewton 
 Silver Band and Empress Majorettes to 
 the Social Club Field Site off Church 
 Road.Many families supported the event
 enjoying several displays from local  
 groups as well a comic football match.</content>
