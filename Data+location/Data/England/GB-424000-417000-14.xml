		<content>   We can tell what sort of{people}live
 around the rectangle we are covering, 
 not just by their clothes, because    
{Catholics}wear the same as{Christians,
 but by{churches, chapels}and{mosques. 
 If there are lots of churches then you
 can guess that there are a lot of     
 Christians living there. If there is a
 big Mosque and it is a very{religious 
 Mosque, you can tell it belongs to the
 Moslims. They also believe in a       
 different religion.  There are some   
 Moslims who act like Christians. They 
 can change their religion.            
   The area we are covering has a lot  
 of churches.  The churches are very   
 old, and they have a lot of           
{graveyards.}By looking at the         
{gravestones,}we think there must have 
 been a lot of disease, because many   
 children{died}when they were about one
 year old.                             </content>
