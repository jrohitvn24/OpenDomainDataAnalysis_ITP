		<title>06BESTWOOD LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Bestwood is so named because it was   
 the king's best wood.Bestwood was the 
 hunting ground for kings for          
 centuries.Richard 111 was hunting in  
 Bestwood when he heard the news that  
 Henry Tudor had landed in Wales with  
 an invasion army.                     
                  Charles 11 gave      
 Bestwood to Nell Gwynne.Their son     
 became the 1st. Duke of ST.Albans.    
 The Leen Valley was a flashpoint of   
 the industrial revolution.Cotton mills
 were set up along it.Two mills were in
 Bestwood,Forge Mill(site of an ancient
 forge)and Middle Mill.                
                       There wasn't a  
 village of Bestwood until 1878 when   
 the first colliers houses were        
 built.The village grew as the mine    
 became more important.The mine was    
 closed in 1962.
