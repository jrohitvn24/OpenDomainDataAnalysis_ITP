		<title>06THE WALL MOUNTED MONUMENT</title>
		<content>     Worth a visit is the wall mounted 
 monument directly opposite the church 
 door.It is of the period of James I,  
 undamaged through the church's        
 isolated position by Cromwell's       
 soldiers. It shows two kneeling       
 figures, Sir Patrick Hume of          
 Wedderbourne, a member of King James' 
 court, and his wife Elizabeth         
 Cockayne. It was a policy of the King 
 to marry his penniless Scottish nobles
 to wealthy English Ladies and the two 
 people figured in the monument were of
 those types.
