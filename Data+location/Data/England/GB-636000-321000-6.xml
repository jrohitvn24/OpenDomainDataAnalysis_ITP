		<title>06CATFIELD AND SUTTON BY PASS</title>
		<content> The only major road in this block is  
 the A149 which by passes the villages 
 of Catfield and Sutton. The road is   
 built on the course of the old Midland
 and Great Northern Joint Railway which
 closed in 1959. The road was built    
 about fifteen years ago. There are    
 many clues that tell us that this was 
 once a railway. In Catfield there is  
 an old station house, and to the south
 there is a weather-boarded crossing   
 keeper's bungalow. The road itself is 
 flat and straight. It is a very good  
 road but some people drive along it   
 too fast. There have been several     
 accidents on this stretch and some    
 parents do not allow their children to
 cycle along it. There is however, no  
 doubt that this road has eased the    
 burden of heavy traffic in the village
 centres.                              
                                       </content>
