		<title>12 School Life In Our Region</title>
		<content>  Our school was opened in 1978 and is 
semi-open planned. It is split into two
halves, each half having a wet area    
surrounded by 4 classrooms. We have a  
hall, T.V. room, library and field.    
  The school day starts at 9.00 a.m.   
with a break of 15mins at 10.30. Lunch 
is between 12.00 &amp; 1.20 p.m. and in the
afternoon we have another 15min break, 
school closing at 3.50 p.m.            
  For lessons we have S.M.P. Maths from
work cards, Language work - stories    
etc., and topic which everyone likes.  
  Children travelling to school from   
Avenue Rd, Newton Bromswold and Newton 
Rd need to catch a coach at 8.00 a.m.  
This arrives at school at 8.30. They   
could walk but it is a long way. The   
children don't have an afternoon play  
so leave at 3.30 p.m. arriving home at 
3.45. The coach buses infant, junior   
and senior children to various schools.</content>
