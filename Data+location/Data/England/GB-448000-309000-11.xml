		<content> Every Friday night is Scouts. You have
 to be 10yrs. 6mnths.to join. Before   
 that you are in Cubs. Flag Break is at
 7.00 p.m. but most people go at 6.15  
 to play around a bit.We usually have a
 game and then do something useful. The
 beginners go and talk to one of the   
 leaders about First Aid or safety in  
 the home. We have to pay 30p.a week   
 'subs'.This year there is an          
 International Camp at Loughborough    
 where Scouts and Guides from all over 
 the world will come. At this camp we  
 will go out for trips like            
 rollerskating and do activities like  
 karate. The camp is for 8 days and 26 
 Scouts are going from our troop.
