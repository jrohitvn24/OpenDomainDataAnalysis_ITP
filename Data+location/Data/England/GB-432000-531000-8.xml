		<title>08HOME ENTERTAINMENT</title>
		<content> Most people in the village have       
 television and this is the most common
 form of home entertainment. Many      
 people too, have video recorders which
 are used to record television         
 programmes and replay them at a later 
 date. Films are sometimes hired and   
 these cost about Â£2.                  
 Many children in the village now have 
 home computers. Younger children      
 use them mainly for games but older   
 children are able to write their own  
 small programmes.                     
 Records and tapes are also a popular  
 kind of home entertainment.A singer   
 called Bruce Springsteen is well liked
 by many of the children in the school.
 Quite a lot of homes now have a       
 snooker table and the game of snooker 
 is quite popular.
