		<content> Learning in Cookham Village was       
 provided, from 1800 in simple High    
 Street cottages, as a result of the   
 influence of the then encumbant {Rev. 
{Brown.}                               
 In 1858 Holy Trinity Primary School   
 was established, and by 1863 the      
 Infant School rooms were erected at   
 the sole expense of{'Misses Fleming'.}
 The school became 'controlled' by the 
 Berkshire Education Authority in 1952.
 The present day school comprises the  
 original buildings, although the      
 headteacher's house has been swallowed
 up in the general running of the      
 school and is now used for storage    
 rooms, resource areas and staff       
 facilities. Other buildings include;  
 an administration block, hall and two 
 classrooms; as well as, swimming pool,
 library, pavilion and two additional  
 free-standing classrooms.             </content>
