		<title>10THE EAST COKER SOCIETY</title>
		<content>  In 1975 the{East Coker Society}was   
 founded.At the first meeting it was   
 decided that{protection and welfare}of
 the village would be looked after;    
 i.e.preserving buildings and keeping  
 footpaths open.{Meetings}take place   
 about 4 times a year and a{newsletter 
 is delivered free about 4 times a year
 to all the 800 houses in the village. 
 Residence in the village confers      
{membership automatically,}there is no 
 membership fee.                       
                                       
  The society has given rise to many   
 other societies in the area which     
 support it with{donations.            
                                       
  As its current project the society   
 plans to produce a{village postcard   
 and is raising funds for this.        
 Photographs submitted by villagers    
 will be used.                         </content>
