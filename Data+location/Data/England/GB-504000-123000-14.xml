		<title>14WISBOROUGH GREEN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> There are two school buildings in     
 Wisborough Green, separated by School 
 Lane. The older part is Victorian and 
 has four classrooms but only two are  
 in use at present for teaching;       
 another is used as a library. At the  
 back is an asphalt playground. This   
 building is used by the younger       
 children who are from five to eight   
 years old.  Every day the children are
 met by their parents when they leave  
 school at 3.20p.m.  Those children who
 live further away are taken home by   
 the school bus.
