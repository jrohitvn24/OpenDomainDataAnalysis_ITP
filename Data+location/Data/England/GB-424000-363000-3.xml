		<content> 'My house is the Village Post Office  
 and general stores. It was built in   
 1932. My mother is the post mistress' 
 .. 'Our cottage is more than 3OO years
 old. It is a listed building. Upstairs
 were two big rooms with high beamed   
 ceilings. Downstairs is one room with 
 a low oak beamed ceiling, a kitchen   
 with a stone sink and a small pantry, 
 lots of stone shelves and hooks for   
 pig salting. Outside was a chemical   
 toilet in a shed. The windows are     
 stone mullioned, arched at the top. On
 the gable end are some large stones   
 sticking out like steps - witches'    
 steps. Long ago people believed that  
 if a witch came to the house she would
 climb the steps and go over the roof  
 to the next house. My dad who is a    
 builder, has fitted an upstairs       
 bathroom and added an extension       
 downstairs.'                          </content>
