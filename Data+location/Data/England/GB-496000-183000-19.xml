		<content> We are surrounded by a complex        
 structure of Motorways. There is the  
 M40,M4 and the new M25.The convenience
 of these Motorways also has           
 disadvantages.The A355 is a link from 
 the M40 to the M4. It bisects the     
 village of Farnham Common and is      
 extremely busy. Between 8.40 to 8.50am
 we counted 320 travelling towards the 
 M4. This dropped to 80 in ten minutes 
 during the day.                       
   Heathrow airport is also close by.  
                                       
  Pollution of the air from fumes is   
 already causing concern. We did a     
 simple test of wiping grass at the    
 roadside.  It was very black. We did  
 the same thing 3mback from the road   
 and our sample was grey.
