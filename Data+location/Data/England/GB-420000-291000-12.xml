		<title>12NETHER WHITACRE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    The Nether Whitacre School log     
 books show the changes in educational 
 ideas throughout this century. The    
 school was given to the village by    
 Charles Jennens, friend of the        
 composer Handel. The building now     
 used was originally a house with a    
 classroom at each end. It has         
 undergone many changes &amp; at present   
 caters for children from 5 to 11 years
 of age.                               
    In 1979 it was threatened with     
 closure but this was overruled. It was
 again scheduled to close in 1985 but  
 parental action opposing the move lead
 to a change of proposal; that of re_  
 organising to a first school(5_8). The
 Minister of State for Education       
 rejected this proposal and the school 
 remains at the moment as a 5_11 school
 but with a very unstable future.
