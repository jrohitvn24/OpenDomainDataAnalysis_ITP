		<content>{Rotherham's Football Club             
  Rotherham's football ground is 101   
 years old and is known Millmoor. It is
 situated at Masborough, near the      
 railway station which in past days    
 provided transport for many           
 spectators. A modern team needs an    
 army of personnel to support it       
 ranging from directors,managers,      
 coaches, physiotherapists and doctors 
 to clerical staff, ground staff       
 laundry and cleaning staff and the    
 ball boys.                            
 Sponsorship is a vital means of       
 financing,especially when the gates   
 have dwindled from 26,000 to 4,000.   
 Additional funds are raised through   
 the supporters clubs, refreshment bars
  and a football souvenir shop.        
 Football violence is not present in   
 Rotherham as rival teams are          
 segregated and the police are vigilant</content>
