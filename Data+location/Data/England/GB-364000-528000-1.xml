		<content> Milburn is a small isolated village on
 the Cumbrian Eastern Fellside, lying  
 underneath Cross Fell and Great Dun   
 Fell. It forms part of a chain of     
 Fellside villages running from        
 Appleby,north to Brampton,near        
 Carlisle. Amongst these it is unique  
 in that nearly all its houses look out
 onto the village green and onto the   
 school which is situated at the top of
 the village. Perhaps on account       
 of its isolated location,Milburn has a
 very strong community spirit and its  
 school is one of the fundamental      
 pillars of this community. It is a    
 fortified village with 2 Gin Cases,l  
 Maypole, Village Hall, Church,        
 Chapel,Village Shop and Antique       
 Shop.It has been  designated a        
 conserved village.
