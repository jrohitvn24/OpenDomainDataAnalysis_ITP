 area.St. Chad's C.E. Controlled in    
 Gladstone St.which was opened in Oct. 
 1909.Most of the 210 pupils on roll   
 live near to the school, the majority 
 from the Dene Estate. The Darnhall Co.
 Primary School is split between 2     
 separate sites.The most modern        
 site (1968) is in Sandyhill Rd., while
 in Darnhall School Lane is the second 
 school built in 1818 and enlarged in  
 1911 and currently used by children   
 below 7 years of age.The original     
 school founded at Darnhall Knobs in   
 1699 hs long since disappeared.At     
 present there are 340 children on

 ;proportions on the Glebe Green and   
 Swanlow Lane estates.At 11 years the  
 pupils of both schools transfer to one
 of 2 local comprehensive schools.
