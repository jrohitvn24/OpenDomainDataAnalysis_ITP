		<title>03THE VETERAN CAR RUN</title>
		<content>  The{Veteran Car Rally}is run every   
 year in November. About 300 cars enter
 but they have to be at least 80 years 
 old. The run is approximately 90      
 kilometres long and the cars that     
 finish before 4.00pm get a small      
 medal. They start at 8.00am. Motor    
 vehicles other than cars, e.g. fire   
 engines, vans and buses have a rally  
 of their own. The rally runs from Hyde
 Park in London to the sea front in    
 Brighton. The drivers and passengers  
 do not have to wear special clothes,  
 though the ride is rather cold and it 
 is a good idea to have blankets.      
 Children can ride in the cars too. All
 the vehicles have engines though some 
 are powered by pedals. The cars come  
 through Horley at about 9.15 to       
 10.10am and are greeted by crowds.
