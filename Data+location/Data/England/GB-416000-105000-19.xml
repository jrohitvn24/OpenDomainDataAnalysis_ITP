		<content> Q. What do you think of fox and       
    pheasant shoots?                   
 A.{I'm not a shooting man myself but I
{   do have to shoot animals as part   
{   of my job when they are in pain.}  
 Q. When you were at school was it your
    ambition to be a vet?              
 A.{Yes, I used to give lectures, breed
{   caterpillars and other small crea- 
{   tures and run little sales.}       
 Q. What is the worst condition in     
    which you have found an animal?    
 A.{I found a mare on the forest, she  
{   was foaling and just about alive   
{   but her foal was dead and foxes had
{   eaten the foal's head and some of  
{   the mother. She was too weak to    
{   kick the foxes away.}              
 Q. What do you do in your spare time? 
 A.{I receive so many phone calls that 
{   I don't get a lot of spare time but
{   I enjoy being with my own horses.} </content>
