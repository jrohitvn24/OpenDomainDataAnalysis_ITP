		<content>  (continued from page 16). There are  
 many residential activities including 
 a health centre, schools and shops.   
 Finally, there are parts of two urban 
 parks, Ashton and Haslam.             
 North of this area, square 5131, is   
 mostly residential with housing       
 varying in age from the 1930s uptil   
 today. The type of housing ranges from
 semi_detached to maisonettes.In the   
 area are found a variety of           
 residential features like churches,   
 schools (one secondary and two primary
 ), public houses and social clubs.    
 Much of the southern part of the area 
 is taken up by the urban park         
 mentionned previously, Haslam Park. It
 is separated from the residential area
 by the Lancaster Canal which passes   
 east to west through the area. The    
 south-west corner is crossed by the   
 Preston to Blackpool railway line.    </content>
