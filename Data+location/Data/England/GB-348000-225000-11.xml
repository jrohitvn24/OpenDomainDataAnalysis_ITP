		<title>11Farming - Fruit Orchards</title>
		<content> Wai-iti Orchards                      
      These were originally grassland, 
 25 acres purchased in l968 and l97l.  
 l2 acres were subsequently planted    
 with 6,500-7,000 apple trees.  The    
 remainder was occupied by house,      
 garden, farm buildings and grass      
 around and amid the orchards - giving 
 23 miles to be mowed regularly.  The  
 owner is the sole full-time worker    
 helped part-time by his wife with     
 picking, packing and orchard          
 maintenance.                          
      The orchard was one of the       
 first intensive ones in the area      
 growing Cox Orange Pippin, Golden     
 Delicious, Bramleys, Spartan and      
 Crispin, planted  in rows l2 ft.      
 apart. Shelter belts comprise TxT 32  
 poplars with black &amp; grey alders.     
 Oaks, horse chesnuts and silver       
 poplars have also been planted.       </content>
