		<title>11MODERN BUILDINGS NEAR BUDE</title>
		<content> Latest buildings are of 2 types, (a)  
 the totally new kind (b) the{renovated
 kind.New buildings are made of large  
 building blocks of{sand waste}from    
{china clay}quarries. The walls have a 
 cavity to allow air to circulate.     
 Styles vary considerably though cement
 rendered{bunglows}are the most common.
 Windows tend to be large and buildings
 of this type can be seen at Stibb.    
    {Renovated}buildings are made of   
 local grey and brown{sandstone}and    
 sometimes rendered with cement.The{N  
{Cornwall Planning and Development     
{Committee}usually suggest that they   
 have grey{slate}rooves.Windows are of 
 the Cornish small-pane type, and are  
 now commonly stained brown with wood  
 preservative.Such renovations have    
 taken place this year at Lower Halls.
