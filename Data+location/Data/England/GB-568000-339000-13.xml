		<content>{RINGSTEAD:}St. Peter's Church was     
 pulled down in 1771.All that remains  
 is a round Norman tower and some head-
 stones in a garden where the church   
 once stood.Other stone objects from   
 the church can be found in the walls  
 of barns and other buildings in the   
 village.                              
 St.Andrews Church,built in the 14th.  
 Century is now in use.The font is as  
 old as the church and there is a fine 
 brass portrait of a priest who served 
 twenty years at Ringstead until 1485. 
{OLD HUNSTANTON}The old village had a  
 church at the time of the Domesday    
 Book but almost all the old work in   
 the church today comes from the first 
 half of the 14th.Century,when it was  
 restored by Sir Hamon LeStrange and   
 his son.The Church was further        
 restored by Henry LeStrange in the    
 last century.       {CONTINUED PAGE 14</content>
