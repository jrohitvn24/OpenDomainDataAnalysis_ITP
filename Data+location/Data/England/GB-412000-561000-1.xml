		<content> In many ways this is an ideal place tp
 live, being within a short distance of
 a major city and yet bordering on the 
 great expense of countryside to the   
 west and north including the beautiful
 Tynedale. During the last ten years,  
 private housing estates have been     
 built on the south side of the        
 original linear settlement of         
 Crawcrook. These are in direct        
 contrast to the terraced colliery     
  houses still in good condition after 
 more than three quarters of a century.
 This area has few remaining signs of  
 the once thriving coal industry other 
 than disused wagonways, a monument    
 marking Chatherne Shaft at Westburn   
 and the Emma Colliery First Aid       
 building. Some small factories are    
 operating on the sites of Stargate &amp;  
 Greenside collieries but the main     
 industries   are farming and quarrying</content>
