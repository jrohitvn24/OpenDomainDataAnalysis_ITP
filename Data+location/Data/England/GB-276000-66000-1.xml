		<content>      The major occupation in this     
 block is{Farming}.There are a         
 number of farms and                   
 hamlets surrounded by farmland .The   
 small hills here are topped with small
 copses often hiding some the very     
 irregular quarrying of former years.  
 All the other land that is not        
 residential is cultivated .There are  
 four {plantations }in this block,but  
 the rest of the land supports         
 livestock and {agricultural }         
 pursuits.The other major concerns     
 include an agricultural hirer at      
 Bickaton and {pig}farm at Beara       
 producing a thousand plus carcases a  
 year. The social centres are at       
 Woolston Green and Woodland,the       
 Victory Hall ,Landscove being the     
 venue for various functions.Large     
 pylons are visible from most places in
 this block.                           </content>
