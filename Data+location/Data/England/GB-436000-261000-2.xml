  The name appears to be of Saxon      
origin with many changes since         
the {ULCHTUNE} of the Domesday Book.   
After the Norman Conquest Ufton        
passed from the Benedictine            
Monastery at Coventry to Coventry      
Priory.It belonged to many others      
before becoming the property of        
Balliol College Oxford in 1679.        
  In 1860 all but 90 acres belonged to 
Balliol.About 50 years ago the college 
began to sell off all parts of  the    
Estate.The wood was sold to Mrs.       
Chamberlayne of Stoneythorpe then      
other parts to the Blue Circle Cement  
Company &amp; so on.                       
  A church has stood on the site since 
1042.The Village stocks were last used 
about 1840.The Village Hall was built  
in 1923.Electricity arrived in 1936,   
water 1950,gas 1969.                   </content>
