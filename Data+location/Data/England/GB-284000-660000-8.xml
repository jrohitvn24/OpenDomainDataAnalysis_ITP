		<title>08LIFE STYLES SHOPPING TRIPS</title>
		<content> Shotts people do not think the        
 shopping facilities are good.         
 Twenty six shops are available at     
 present,one of which is a small       
 supermarket.A good number have closed 
 their doors.The{Co-operative Society }
 which used to be very prosperous has  
 contracted its operations severely.   
 There are:8 hairdressers,4 banks,4    
 fish and chip shops-eternally         
 popular-and 3 garages.                
 Mothers of young schoolchildren will  
 often combine the delivery of their   
 offspring to school in the morning    
 with a visit to the shops.            
 Those who desire a greater choice of  
 goods make the occasional trip to     
{Wishaw}or to{Glasgow.}A recent        
 development has been the occasional   
 organisation of busloads of shoppers  
 to visit{England,}even{France,}surely 
 a tiring if adventurous weekend trip. </content>
