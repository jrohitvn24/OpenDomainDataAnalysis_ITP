		<title>13Warren's Furniture Shop.</title>
		<content>Mr. Warren is an Antique Furniture     
Restorer.  He works in a small shop    
behind his house in Leiston High       
Street.  He runs the business with the 
help of his wife.  He repairs all kinds
of furniture.  There are chairs,       
tables, chests-of-drawers, cabinets,   
desks and bureaus.  He keeps all the   
damaged furniture in a storage room.   
When they are ready for repair, he     
takes it to his workshop.  In here he  
has machines for sawing up the new     
wood, shaping and planing it.          
sometimes table tops require leather on
their top surface.  It needs skill and 
patience to make a good job of it.     
First he cuts the leather to the       
correct size.  He paints the bare table
top all over with solvite.  Then       
carefully lays the leather down on top.
He decorates the leather with gold     
paint using a special instrument.      </content>
