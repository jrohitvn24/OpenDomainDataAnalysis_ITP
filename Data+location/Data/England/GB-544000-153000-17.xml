		<title>17CARE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Care Village is a home for handicapped
 people run by the Care Organisation.  
 The house was built in 1834 and called
 the Philippines after Philip Earl     
 Stanhope.                             
 The people who live there all have    
 their own room and during the day they
 work at different activities. The     
 women do sewing and make all different
 kinds of toys, cushions and patchwork 
 garments. The men do woodwork making  
 small items of furniture and some make
 bowls on the lathe.                   
 The house has large gardens where all 
 kinds of plants are grown to sell and 
 the grounds are looked after by the   
 villagers.                            
 The people who live there are very    
 well looked after and very happy.
