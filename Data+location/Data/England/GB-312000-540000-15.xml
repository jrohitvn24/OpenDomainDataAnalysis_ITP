		<content> Got up at 8 a.m. to get ready for     
 church.                               
 I had cornflakes and a cup of tea for 
 breakfast.                            
 Went to chuch at 9.20 a.m. where I    
 sing in the choir.                    
 I went to Sunday School at 10.45 a.m. 
 For lunch I had a packet of gammon    
 flavoured crisps,a jam sandwich and a 
 drink of an apple and blackberry      
 drink.                                
 After lunch I played out with Sharon  
 Greer at cards, 'Run,Rabbit,Run,'and  
 'Stay Alive.'Then we played on bikes  
 with Michael Hazelwood.               
 When Michael went in Mrs. Wooly gave  
 Sharon and I a merangue each, they    
 were lovely because they had cream in 
 the middle.She asked us if we had any 
 jam-jars because if we did we could   
 have some cinder toffee that she had  
 made.                                 </content>
