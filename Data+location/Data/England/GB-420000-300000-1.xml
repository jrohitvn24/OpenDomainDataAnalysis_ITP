		<title>01 General Description</title>
		<content> The area consists of part of the      
floodplain of the River Tame together  
with undulating land on either side.   
The floodplain itself is still         
agricultural land but on the higher    
land are the older settlements of      
Fazeley and Wilnecote.                 
 The area is crossed by the A5 Trunk   
road, the A51, the A4091 and the       
railway from Birmingham to Tamworth and
the north..                            
 Coal mining used to be important in   
the area and much of the newer housing 
is built on reclaimed mining land.     
These newer estates of Glascote and    
Belgrave are part of Tamworth expanded 
town and were planned to house         
overspill population from Birmingham.  
 There is some light industry in the   
area including the Reliant car factory.
