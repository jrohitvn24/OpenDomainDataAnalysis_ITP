		<title>02FARMING, THEBURTON</title>
		<content> The farms are arable with few cattle. 
 A farmer asked what made his choice of
 crops, the answer was profit and thus 
 the crops are wheat and barley and not
 many cattle, so minimising a milk     
 surplus. Some beet is grown and rape, 
 less beans and peas even though these 
 carry a government subsidy, but one   
 farmer said they are not easy crops,  
 labour intensive and more subject to  
 weather damage than cereals. To rid   
 the fields of stubble after           
 harvesting, it is often burnt, in     
 which case fires are strictly         
 controlled and the remains must be    
 ploughed in within 24 hours to lessen 
 pollution. A little oats and potatoes 
 are grown. 140 bullocks are reared,   
 and another farm has a small dairy    
 herd. Several farms have a few goats, 
 chickens, ducks and pigs. There is    
 some muck spreading &amp; chemical usage. </content>
