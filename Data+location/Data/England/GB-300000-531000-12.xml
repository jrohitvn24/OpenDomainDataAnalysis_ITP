		<title>12Industry _ Pollution</title>
		<content> The pollution in this area is very    
 dangerous to bathers who swim in the  
 Solway Firth.The radio active waste   
 gets washed up onto the shores of the 
 Solway Firth.People around this area  
 don't eat shell fish out of the sea   
 because the radio active waste gets   
 into their bodies.In 1984 bathers in  
 Siddick were sitting in a rock pool   
 for a short period and when they got  
 out they were covered in blisters     
 .Sellafield is very dangerous because 
 of the radio active waste.The worst   
 hit area is between Maryport and      
 Workington.In Flimby some becks that  
 are in the woods are polluted by      
 people who go for pick-nicks who throw
 things in.One beck near the woods is  
 full of paint and sewerage.
