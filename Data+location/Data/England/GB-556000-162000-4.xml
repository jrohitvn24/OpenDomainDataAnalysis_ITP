		<title>04The European Grand Prix 1985</title>
		<content> The{European Grand Prix}for motor cars
 was held at Brands Hatch on 6th       
 October 1985.  It was moved there     
 after insoluble problems at the       
 original venue.                       
                                       
 The organisation at Brands Hatch is   
 extremely efficient and the{whole race
{was organised in less than ninety     
{days.} This is the second time in     
 recent years that Brands Hatch has    
 stepped in to rescue the European     
 Grand Prix.                           
                                       
 The race was a memorable one, in which
 the British driver,{Nigel Mansell,}had
 his first ever Grand Prix victory in  
 over fifty starts. {Alain Prost,}by   
 finishing fourth, ahead of{Michele    
{Alboretto,}clinched the{World Driver's
{championship,}the first time a French-
 man had ever won the championship.    </content>
