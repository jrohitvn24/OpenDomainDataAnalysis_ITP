 Crockenhill has about 560 homes and an
 electorate of about 1200.It is well   
 balanced as far as age ,status and    
 social groupings are concerned.A 55   
 unit mixed development at Seven Acres 
 is being built now.There is a lively  
 village community though older people 
 say it was better in the past.Local   
 activities survive by relying on small
 bands of enthusiasts.It is easy       
 ,however,to underestimate the extent  
 of commitment because people tend to  
 concentrate on one activity without   
 knowing what else is going on.  The   
 village wants to preserve its identity
 from suburbia which ends at St.Mary   
 Cray.It has been called"The sleeping  
 dragon".It passes its days without    
 excitement until its status quo is    
 threatened and then it is aroused and 
 all go to its defence.                </content>
