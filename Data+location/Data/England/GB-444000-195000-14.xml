   Marcham has a dangerous double bend 
in the middle of the village (photo    
B). We wanted to find out something    
about people in Marcham who had cars,  
and what they used them for. We also   
wanted to find out what other transport
they used. We thought this would give a
good picture of what Marcham people are
like today.                            
   We took round about 500             
questionaires, and got answers from    
over half. We then used the {QUEST}    
computer program to analyze the        
figures. We took 100 answers, selecting
them from different parts of the       
village. The figures are on page 15.
