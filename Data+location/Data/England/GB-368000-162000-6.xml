		<content>      Newton Park house was built about
 1780, by a very rich man called Lord  
 Temple.  During later years other     
 buildings were added to the house.    
 During the war of l939 - 1945 it was  
 temporarily converted into a hospital.
 In the later 1940s it became a college
 but its official opening was not until
 l952.  It was a college to train      
 students to be musicians and teachers.
 Initially, all the students were      
 ladies.                               
      The College is now much bigger   
 and has more students than ever       
 before.  The college is now called the
 Bath College of Higher Education      
 Incorporating Bath Academy of Art.    
 There are both male and female        
 students studying a wide variety of   
 subjects.  The main subjects are now  
 Education, Music,Art and Home         
 Economics.                            </content>
