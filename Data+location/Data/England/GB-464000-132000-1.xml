		<title>01FOUR MARKS: ITS NAME</title>
		<content> HOW FOUR MARKS GOT ITS NAME:  At the  
 time of the Napoleonic wars( early    
 1800's), a line of beacons was        
 maintained (before Semaphore) from    
 Portsmouth to London. A fee was       
 payable for maintaining the beacon and
 the site at Telegraph Lane was claimed
 by the four parishes of Chawton,      
 Medstead, Farringdon and Ropley.  The 
 Bishop of Winchester decided that the 
 Beacon Area would be designated as    
 extra-parochial and bounded by Four   
 Stone Marks and he would take the fee 
 for maintaining the Beacon.  Hence,   
 Four Marks was originally the area of 
 the Beacon site. The name appears on  
 the 1897 Ordnance map and a Post      
 Office Guide for 1875 lists a public  
 house in Medstead called 'The Four    
 Marks' run by a John Wyeth.  In 1904  
 Four Marks was using its own          
 cancellation on letters.              </content>
