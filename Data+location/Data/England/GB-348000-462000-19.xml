sports centre. Inter-city swimming and 
water polo matches are held in the     
centre. The cost of improving Kingsway 
baths has come to &amp;500,000. In 1939    
the total cost of building a completly 
new structure was &amp;17,000. Now as the  
centre is nearly complete, the         
facilities availible are-Sports Hall,  
Minor Sports Hall,Activity Room,Creche 
Gymnasium,Swimming Pools,Intercity-
