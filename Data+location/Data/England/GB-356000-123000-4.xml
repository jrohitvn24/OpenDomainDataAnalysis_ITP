		<title>04CHANGES IN THE CAMELS AREA</title>
		<content>    The greatest change that has taken 
 place in our area during the past 40  
 years is the amount of traffic. The   
 A303 used to be quiet enough for      
 children to walk along, there were a  
 few cars and some horses and carts.   
 Now it is almost impossible to cross  
 the road particularly during the      
 summer months.                        
    There are now more people in the   
 area than 40 years ago with a sudden  
 surge in building in the last 12      
 years.                                
    Since people can travel easily     
 now, they no longer need so many local
 shops. There are now only small       
 general stores, and the butchers,     
 ironmongers, saddlers and blacksmith  
 have closed down. Prices in the shops 
 have risen tremendously but then so   
 have wages. Bus services have been cut
 in the past 15 years.                 </content>
