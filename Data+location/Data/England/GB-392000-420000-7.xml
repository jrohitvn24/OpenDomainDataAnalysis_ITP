		<title>07The Garden Centre.</title>
		<content>     One of the biggest employers in   
 Walsden is Gordon Rigg &amp; Son, with    
 their nursery.                        
     During the summer more than 30,000
 people visit the garden centre from   
 all parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire.
     It is one of the largest and best 
 garden centres in the North of        
 England. They grow bedding plants by  
 the million and cater for all kinds of
 people, the amateur gardener to the   
 connoisseur; the man with a small     
 garden who just wants a few plants, to
 the professional.                     
     While an industrial area might not
 be the ideal setting it is well placed
 for customers, sitting as it does in  
 the middle of a highly populated area.
     The nursery has everything you    
 could possibly want for your garden   
 from shears to sheds, from greenhouses
 to grass-seeds.                       </content>
