		<content> Relaxation for some means a visit to  
 a LOCAL HOSTELRY to play SKITTLES or  
 DARTS or merely to talk, when the main
 subject is invariably THE WEATHER.    
                                       
 Others tend GARDENS, growing flowers  
 and vegetables, with the keen         
 competitors entering the ANNUAL FLOWER
 SHOW held on August Bank Holiday.  The
 public-spirited sit on many Village   
 Committees such as VILLAGE HALL,      
 WOMEN'S INSTITUTE, WIVES CLUB, CANCER 
 RESEARCH CAMPAIGN, SCHOOL BOARD,      
 OVER-SIXTIES, PLAY SCHOOL, PARISH     
 COUNCIL and PAROCHIAL CHURCH COUNCIL. 
                                       
 The younger inhabitants play FOOTBALL 
 or CRICKET and there is much          
 HORSE-RIDING as well as a BROWNIE     
 GUIDE ORGANISATION.
