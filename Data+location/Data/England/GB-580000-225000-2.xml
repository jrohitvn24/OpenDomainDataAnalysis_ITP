		<content> Greenstead Green has two pulic houses 
 where refreshments and meals can be   
 purchased during licensing hours.  The
 Hare and Hounds has a garden area open
 to the public and provides a facility 
 of swings and slides for small        
 children, as well as seating and      
 tables for adults so they may enjoy   
 their drinks and meals whilst keeping 
 a watch over their children.  This    
 makes it an enjoyable family occasion.
 There is a garden nursery in          
 Greenstead Green which is very well   
 known for its magnificent display of  
 fuscias.  From early spring the public
 are invited to wander at their leisure
 and see and purchase some of these    
 beautiful plants.
