		<content> The majority of the land is used for  
 arable farming growing wheat and oil  
 seed rape.Many fine trees blend into  
 the{Essex}and{Herfordshire}countryside
 and are a notable feature of the area.
 There are four areas of population.   
{BIRCHANGER}:A small village with a    
 church,school and social club.        
{FARNHAM}:Surrounded by farmland with  
 a few thatched cottages and farms.    
{STANSTED MOUNTFITCHET}: Believed to be
 the largest village in Essex lying in 
 an agriculural area but has developed 
 into an attraction for access for     
 commuters to London and Cambridge.    
 The valleys of the River Stort and    
 Stansted Brook form the major         
 landscape elements to the west and new
 housing development to the north.     
{BISHOP'S STORTFORD}: The north part of
 the town has old and new houses,      
 playing areas and a swimming pool.    </content>
