		<title>19World War 2 Relics - Well</title>
		<content>  Well Vale Estate was used by the Army
 during the War as an Ammunition Dump. 
 The evidence of Mr.Hilton, father of a
 present member of staff at the Grammar
 School, who was stationed at Bilsby   
 from December 1942 until early 1943,  
 indicates that it was used to supply  
 surrounding gun sites. There were     
 several units there at that time,     
 comprising 3 batteries of 24 Field    
 Regiment, in transit to N.Africa and  
 8th. Army. Mr. Hilton was a signaller 
 and detached from the Royal Worcester 
 Regiment for use by No.1 Battery. They
 left in early 1943 for N.Africa. Later
 in the war the camp became a prisoner-
 of-war camp.                          
  There is little physical evidence of 
 the occupation, the Army having       
 withdrawn by 1950. All that can be    
 found are the camp front steps, some  
 building bases and concrete roads.    </content>
