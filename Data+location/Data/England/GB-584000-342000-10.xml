		<title>10HOLKHAM PARK</title>
		<content> There is a nine mile wall all the way 
 round the park.  A large part of the  
 park has been converted into arable   
 land, but there is still a great area 
 of grazing land.  Lord Coke's father  
 left Holkham Hall to his son Edward   
 Coke and retired to South Africa 15   
 years ago.  The park was in a shambles
 before Edward Coke took over.  Holkham
 is famous for its deer.  The most     
 popular crops to be grown on the      
 estate are sugar beet and winter      
 wheat.  There are over 800 sheep.     
 When you come into the park you may   
 see that there are a few cattle grids 
 instead of gates to keep the deer in.
