		<title>09THE DANBURY 3-DAY EVENT</title>
		<content> In the past Danbury schools and       
 assoiciates have offered a wide range 
 of fun and activities such as squash  
 clubs but the greatest of them all was
 the Danbury 3-Day Event.This was held 
 at the Danbury Youth Camp.It was an   
 enjoyable event.On Friday the 28th all
 the schools that chose to particapate 
 had a day of showing their talent     
 and hard work off.There were schools  
 from as far off as Colchester.The     
 atmosphere was happy and              
 lively.Barclays Bank,TSB Bank and     
 Essex Radio were the main sponsors    
 and the event was held in             
 commemoration of International Youth  
 year.There were exhibitions of        
 handi-crafts.Some professional Chinese
 kite flyers came to fly their kites   
 and the biggest hot air balloon in the
 world was realeased into the sky.All  
 in all it was an excellent day!       </content>
