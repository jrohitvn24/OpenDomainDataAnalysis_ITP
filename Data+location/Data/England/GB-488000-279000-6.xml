		<title>06Boughton Estate, Kettering</title>
		<content> Boughton is a highly efficient and    
well managed estate and the focal      
point of an active rural community.    
 The Estate employs many able people   
and technicians who are expert in their
various fields and has much specialised
equipment for the various activities it
undertakes.                            
 Estate management is concerned with   
food and timber production, nature     
conservation, the protection of the    
environment, sport, recreation and     
public amenity.                        
 The Estate Office is situated in the  
village of Weekley and it is here that 
the various activities are co-ordinated
under the direction of the Agent.      
 Conservation of a number of villages  
has been a priority.   Without the     
financial backing of the Estate and its
skilled craftsmen some of our national 
heritage might have been lost.         </content>
