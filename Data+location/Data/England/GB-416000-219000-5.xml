{generation}who come by car or coach   
 for a day trip. Many{retired people}  
 visit the village in the{early or late
{season}and many{school parties}come   
 for outings in{June and July.}A large 
 proportion of the{overseas visitors } 
 are{American}or{French}but many       
 nationalities are here in the most    
 popular months of July and August.    
 Many of the gift shops and cafes close
 during the winter months, reopening at
 Easter for the holiday season.There   
 are several hotels and inns with      
 accommodation, restaurants and cafes. 
 Many local pubs have adapted to the   
 tourist trade by building extensions  
 and by extending their range of snacks
 and bar food. One pub on the Fosseway 
 supplies 140 meals on an average day  
 in August compared to only 40 in June.</content>
