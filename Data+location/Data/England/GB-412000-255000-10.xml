		<title>10SCHOOL HASELOR, WARKS.</title>
		<content> At school we have adopted the charity 
 Action Research for the Crippled Child
 as the charity we support. Over the   
 last few years we have raised between 
 Â£100 and Â£400 a year.Every Autumn Term
 we elected officers for the Action    
 Committee from the 4th year pupils. We
 hold meetings to decide what events we
 will hold to raise money for Action.  
 When we have decided we ask Miss Fox  
 if we can go ahead to arrange them.If 
 possible we do everything ourselves   
 but,of course,we have to have adult   
 help for such things as barbecues.Most
 years we have a Hallow E'en party or  
 disco,we dress up as witches,wizards  
 or cats etc. Once we had a Sponsored  
 Backwards Walk.We have a sponsored    
 events. During the Summer Term we have
 a 'Penny Party' when we run sideshows 
 and sell things we have made,but it is
 really a 3p now because of inflation. </content>
