		<content> Whilst the onslaught reigns I'm       
 assembling dinner for Rob's arrival   
 around 5 or 6 or 6.30.Not bad         
 today,positively early,enabling him to
 do his PTA stint of putting up their  
 new curtains.Several hours later      
 family returns.Almost done,two kids in
 bed,one small hand clasped tightly in 
 mine whilst the nightly story is read,
 Kit falls asleep.Jo chatters on about 
 little experiences,Rob continues with 
 school work,I load the washing        
 machine,make tomorrow's sandwiches,   
 snatch some TV and take the paper to  
 bed hoping to read some before sleep  
 defeats me. Well, that was the day    
 that was. Goodnight.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
