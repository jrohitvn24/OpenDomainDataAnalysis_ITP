		<title>06Banwell Volunteer Fire Crew</title>
		<content>    There are ten men in the fire crew 
 at Banwell, all volunteers. They are  
 great friends and they are always     
 joking and messing around. My dad is  
 the chairman of the fire crew and is  
 known as Wally Rice. My uncle is also 
 in the crew. Mr.D.Colbourne, the      
 secretary, is teaching me photography.
 I like the nickname of the Chief Fire 
 Officer, Mr.C.Hornett, it's "Stinger".
    The fire crew managed to get a Fire
 Engine from Board Mills of Bristol    
 which had closed down. It is a Land   
 Rover well equipped with a pump able  
 to pump over 160 gallons of water a   
 minute. It also has lots of different 
 sized branches to fit the hoses onto. 
 There is also a ladder on board.      
    The Fire Crew all paraded in the   
 1985 Armistice Day Parade and also    
 attended the service in Banwell Parish
 Church.                               </content>
