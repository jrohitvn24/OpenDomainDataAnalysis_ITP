		<title>03THAMES-SIDE FORTS</title>
		<content> In this particular area three forts   
 were established in the eighteenth    
 century to defend the river approaches
 to London but these are now disused   
 and most are in disrepair. The three  
 forts together formed the first line  
 of defence. They were subsequently    
 strengthened in the 1860's. One,{     
{Shornemead Fort},in Kent,was still    
 used as a defence post in the First   
 and Second World Wars in this century.
 Now only part of the structure remains
 but the facade gives an impression of 
 completeness.{Cliffe Fort}is in a bad 
 state of repair and is fenced off from
 the public. The{Coalhouse Fort}in     
 Essex is being refurbished by Thurrock
 Council;a small Aircraft Museum has   
 been established there and the fort is
 surrounded by an attractive public    
 park which includes a boating pool.
