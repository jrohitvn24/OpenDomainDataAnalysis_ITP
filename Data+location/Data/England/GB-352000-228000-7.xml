		<title>07RIVERSIDE WALK AT HOARWITHY</title>
		<content> There is a good network of public     
 footpaths at Hoarwithy which are used 
 by visitors and ramblers. Most paths  
 are signposted, but many stiles need  
 repairing.   A pleasant two mile walk 
 starts from the iron bridge at        
 Hoarwithy. Cross the stile opposite   
 the tall house and follow the signed  
 path along the banks of the River Wye.
 At a small ruined shed turn left      
 across an awkward hurdle onto the     
 road, which you cross and immediately 
 turn left up a steep winding lane to  
 Altbough.At the next road junction    
 turn right, and at the brow of the    
 hill take the signed bridlepath on the
 left leading between hedges. After a  
 narrow gate the path enters a field   
 with good open views. Keep to the left
 hand side, then steeply descend the   
 sunken track to the lane. Turn left   
 past Tresseck Farm to Hoarwithy.      </content>
