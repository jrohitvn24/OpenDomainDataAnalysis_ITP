		<title>02      WIGHILL VILLAGE</title>
		<content>       Wighill is only a small country 
 village . It has no shops not even a  
 post office, only a pub The White Swan
 which is popular with the visitors    
 from other places.  All the houses    
 line the roadside so it is a long thin
 village.  Many of the houses are old  
 and used to have thatched rooves.     
 These were mainly the cottages and    
 farms.                                
      Altogether there are sixty       
 houses and a total population of two  
 hundred. There are all sorts of       
 houses from council semis, to old     
 stone detached's. The modern houses   
 and bungalows that have been built in 
 the last 20 years are brick built.    
 The church is at the end of the       
 village sited on a hill. It has one of
 the best preserved Norman doorways in 
 Yorkshire.
