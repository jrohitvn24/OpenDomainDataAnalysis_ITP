		<title>01The River Maun</title>
		<content>  The river Maun rises in Sutton where 
 it is called the Idle.It joins Kings  
 Mill reservoir and then,as the Maun,  
 flows through the Mansfield area,     
 through{Clipstone}and Edwinstowe      
 before finally joining the river Meden
 near Bothamsall.                      
  In the past the Maun supplied water  
 to a system of{flood dykes}which,by   
 the use of sluice gates, allowed water
 to irrigate the farmland.The high     
 sewage content of the water made it   
 ideal for this purpose.These dykes are
 no longer in operation and those      
 running parallel to the river in the  
 area we surveyed are now simply lakes 
 which the local farmer is converting  
 into a{wildfowl}reserve.At the time we
 made one of our visits he was         
 supervising the digging of a channel  
 on the far bank of one of the dykes to
 form an island to encourage breeding. </content>
