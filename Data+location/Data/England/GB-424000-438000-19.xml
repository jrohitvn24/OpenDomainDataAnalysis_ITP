		<content> The majority of the people are        
 Christian i.e.Church of               
 England,Methodist or Catholic.However 
 alot of other religions are           
 thriving,because they seem to have    
 overcome being taunted by others who  
 think they are inferior.              
 The Norman church,now Church of E     
 ngland,was built in 1150 and there are
 still remains from the original       
 building:the font,the altar and both  
 of the arches.At a glance graves can  
 be seen from 1650 and earlier.The     
 Methodist churches are not,of         
 course,quite so old as the religion   
 was only formed in the mid-1700's.
