		<content> Premier Drum-1st in Percussion is one 
 of the biggest factories in South     
 Wigston.It is on the main Blaby Road  
 and covers an area of 100,000         
 square feet.The factory moved to its  
 present site about 10 years ago.Before
 that it was on 3 separate sites - in  
 Canal Street,Pullman Road and Magna   
 Road.At present there are 180         
 employees.It is the largest           
 manufacturer of acoustic percussion in
 Europe,and probably in the world,     
 exporting to 120 different countries. 
 The founder of the firm began         
 producing percussion instruments in   
 London in 1922 and the firm was sited 
 in London until it was bombed in      
 1939-40. It had been engaged in war   
 work and after the bombing the        
 Ministry of Works moved it up to a    
 vacant site in South Wigston.
