		<content> IN SALISBURY THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF
 ENTERTAINMENT.  IN OUR BLOCK WE HAVE  
 APPROXIMATELY FIVE KINDS OF           
 ENTERTAINMENT.  THE AMATEUR STUDIO    
 THEATRE  PRODUCE SHAKESPEAREAN PLAYS

 YEAR IT IS THE TEMPEST.  AT CHRISTMAS 
 EVERY YEAR OUR SCHOOL PUTS ON A       
 NATIVITY PLAY.  SOMETIMES CLASSES JOIN
 TOGETHER AND PUT ON ONE PLAY BUT      
 SOMETIMES EACH CLASS PUTS ON ONE ON   
 ITS OWN.  WE HAVE A CONCERT WHERE THE 
 CLASSES SING THE SONGS THAT HAVE BEEN 
 LEARNED THROUGH THE YEAR.  WE ALSO    
 HAVE A FETE WITH BOYS AND GIRLS       
 RACING.  IN HUDSON FIELD EVERY YEAR A 
 CIRCUS COMES FOR THREE DAYS.  AT FIRST
 THE ENTRANCE FEE IS ONE POUND BUT THEN
 IT GOES UP TO THREE POUNDS.  INSIDE   
 PEOPLE COME ROUND AND GIVE YOU SWEETS 
 ETC.  WHILST THEY DO THIS THE ANIMALS 
 DO THEIR PART.                        </content>
