		<content> There was a church on this site as    
 early as 1085 A.D. Parts of this      
 building,and of an even earlier saxon 
 church,are still in evidence.         
                                       
 Every July there is a special service 
 known as the 'Clippings'.Together with
 this service a fair is held with many 
 different stalls and activities.      
                                       
 Each year the pupils of Tankersley    
 Junior School are given a test on     
 their knowledge of the New            
 Testement.The four children with the  
 best marks are awarded the Fenn       
 Bible.The award is made at a special  
 service at which the congregation join
 hands around the church and sing      
 hymns.Inside the church a trumpeter   
 plays from the balcony.
