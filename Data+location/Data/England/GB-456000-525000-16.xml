		<title>16Housing Survey</title>
		<content> The majority of houses were built     
 before 1930, many dating back to the  
 beginning of the century. The most    
 recent are two bungalows which were   
 built in 1979. Most are large terraced
 houses, many of which have been turned
 into flats or used as Bed and         
 Breakfast accommodation.              
                                       
 There were twelve terraced streets in 
 Warrenby but these were demolished in 
 the 1970's because of their poor      
 condition.                            
                                       
 There are very few gardens in the area
 because of the terracing although all 
 the houses have backyards. The more   
 recent houses, mainly small           
 semi-detached, have small gardens back
 and front. Not many houses have front 
 garages. Most are behind the houses   
 with access via back alleys.          </content>
