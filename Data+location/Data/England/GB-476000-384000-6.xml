		<content> WEST BURTON Power Station.            
                                       
 West Burton Power Station was built in
 1965. It was built there because it   
 uses 12 million gallons of water per  
 day and the river Trent run where it  
 is built. It is called West Burton    
 because where it is built there used  
 to be a little village called West    
 Burton.The cooling towers are 350 feet
 high 284 feet in perimeter at the     
 bottom and 164 feet in perimeter at   
 the top.In 24 hours there are 3 shifts
 altogether.The fuel they use is coal  
 but in a crisis like the miners strike
 they use oil.700 people are employed  
 there.
