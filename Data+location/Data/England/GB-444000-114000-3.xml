{Transport}links in the area are in the
 process of being continuously improved
 as trade and business flourishes and  
 the needs and general requirements    
 of most of the surrounding local      
{industry}becomes greater.             
{Trade}along the south coast of England
 has benefitted by the recently opened 
 M27 Motorway linking Southampton to   
 Portsmouth.The M27 is made of         
 sand,gravel,cement and a layer of     
 tarmac going over the top surface.    
 Traffic flow measured in July 1985    
 was between 1,300 and 1,500 vehicles  
 per hour in each direction, with the  
 majority being private cars.          
 Minor roads link the area with the    
 port of Southampton and the southern  
 interland.
