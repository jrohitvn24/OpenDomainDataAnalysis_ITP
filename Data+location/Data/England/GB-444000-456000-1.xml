		<title>01GREEN HAMMERTON AND WHIXLEY.</title>
		<content> Green Hammerton and Whixley are       
 lowland villages in Yorkshire. Most of
 the farmers are dairy or arable so    
 much of the land is crops such as     
 Oats, Barley, Wheat and Oilseed Rape. 
 Green Hammerton lies in the vale of   
 York. The city of York  lies about 10 
 miles away to the south east. The     
 school was in danger of closing down  
 but was saved by the parents. But     
 Whixley was closed down instead.Each  
 village has a post office and a pub.  
 The land has very rich soil and to buy
 an acre it would cost you Â£1500. There
 are three farmers in Green Hammerton. 
 The village lies at the junction of   
 three roads, one south east to York,  
 one due north to Borobridge and one   
 west to Knaresborough and Harrogate.  
 Both Whixley and Green Hammerton are  
 on Roman Roads to the R. town         
 Aldbrough .                           </content>
