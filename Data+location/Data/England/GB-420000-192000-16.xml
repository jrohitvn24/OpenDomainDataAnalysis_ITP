		<title>16Traffic in Highworth.</title>
		<content> Highworth is on the A361 which goes   
 north from Swindon towards Lechlade.  
 We carried out traffic counts at the  
 junction of the A361 with the         
 Highworth High Street at every hour   
 during one day. The main rush hours   
 are between 7am and 8am, and between  
 5pm and 6.30pm. The quietest time is  
 at 2pm. Only 20% of the traffic on the
 A361 turns into the High Street ; the 
 rest passes through the town. Most    
 people of Highworth would like the    
 town to have a by-pass. Also they     
 think that the roads should be        
 improved, the number of lorries       
 reduced and a subway built under the  
 A361.
