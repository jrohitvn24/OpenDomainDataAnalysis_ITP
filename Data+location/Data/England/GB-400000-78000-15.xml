		<title>15THE RAILWAY TODAY SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   In 1980 the railway made it's first 
 run from Swanage to Herston (one mile 
 away). This was done after much work  
 by volunteers who gave up a lot of    
 their spare time. As the line is      
 extended new halts will be built en   
 route to Wareham so that as many      
 people as possible can benifit, as    
 early as possible, from the restored  
 rail service.                         
   At the present time the trains are  
 pulled by industrial tank engines.    
 Some of the coaches are historical    
 Southern and British Railway coaches, 
 including a Pullman. As it takes a    
 few hours for a steam engine to get up
 steam, a diesel engine can be used to 
 save time. This diesel will also      
 be used regularly when the track      
 is eventually extended to Wareham.
