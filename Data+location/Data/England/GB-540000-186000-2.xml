 Education is started at the age of    
 five when you start Primary school.The
 first three years of the Primary      
 school is called the Infants.The last 
 four are called the Juniors.The       
 juniors usually have longer hours, and
 less attention is paid to each pupil. 
 There are toys in the infants but none
 in the juniors.At the age of ten or   
 eleven most children take the         
 selection test.This decides which     
 Secondary school they go to. From this
 test about 4% of the children go to   
 Grammar school.There are five years in
 secondary school, or you can go on to 
 a sixth year.In the fifth year you    
 take O levels.These are examinations  
 in different subjects.
