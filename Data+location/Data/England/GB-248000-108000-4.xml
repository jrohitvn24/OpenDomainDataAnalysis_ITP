		<content> in small development groupings in the 
 centre of the village - the only area 
 served by a{main sewer. }These devel- 
 opments took place in 1968-1971 and   
 1981.  Modern bungalows generally have
 a single living room and two or three 
 bedrooms, and cottages follow the same
 arrangement.   Houses either are, or  
 were, farmhouses and generally have at
 least three living rooms.  All the    
 homes have{mains electricity,}and with
 only one or two exceptions all have   
{mains water.} 75% are connected to the
{telephone system. }Mains gas is not   
 available in the area.  All resi-     
 dential properties have a bathroom and
 inside lavatory. Most people cook by  
 electricity or solid fuel, which also 
 serves to heat water and some central 
 heating.  In the event of a major     
 power failure the community would     
 virtually grind to a halt.            </content>
