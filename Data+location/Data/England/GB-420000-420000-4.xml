		<content> There is little{industry}in this 1km  
 square (O.S. grid ref. 04200422). In  
 fact, it consists of 1 garage, 3      
 general stores and 2 small businesses.
 The latter, however, are quite unusual
 for a small village. The larger of the
 2 is a{soft toy factory}employing     
 about 20 people, mostly women. The    
 women spend most of their time sewing,
 stuffing and packing soft toys which  
 are mostly sold at the seaside at     
 prices ranging from 90p to Â£5.        
 The other business is a{dog grooming  
{parlour}which does washing, shampooing
 and trimming. Its 2 main customers are
 poodles and Yorkshire terriers who are
 charged from Â£1 to Â£20.               
 The 3 general stores include a{Post   
{Office}and an off-licence. They sell  
 food, tinned and frozen, fresh        
 vegetables, confectionery, household  
 goods and tobacco.                    </content>
