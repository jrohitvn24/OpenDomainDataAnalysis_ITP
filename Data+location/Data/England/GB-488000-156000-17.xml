		<title>17An Ordinary Day in My Life</title>
		<content>   On a school day I get up at 07:30. I
 get dressed and ready for school. Then
 at 08:45 my dad takes my brothers and 
 me to Blackdown First and Middle      
 School. School finishes at 15:00 then 
 my dad comes and picks us up again.   
 When I get home to Deepcut Village I  
 usually get changed and peel potatoes 
 for my dad to make into chips to sell 
 in his takeaway. After tea at 16:30 I 
 go out to see my friends. At 18:00 I  
 go home in case my dad needs help     
 before he opens up at 18:30. Then I go
 out again to see my mum who lives on  
 the army camp with her second husband.
 At 20:00 I go home, do my homework,   
 then at about 21:30 I switch my light 
 out and go to sleep.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
