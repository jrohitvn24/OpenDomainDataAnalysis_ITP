 Interview by children of Woolsthorpe  
 by Belvoir Primary School.            
 A farmer and his family's Sunday.     
 On Sundays the family rise at varying 
 times according to what needs to be   
 done that day.If their daughter needs 
 to go horse riding a distance away the
 farmer takes her and if his son needs 
 to go to hockey or football matches he
 drives him too.The farmer enjoys      
 cricket and golf.On Sunday the farm   
 work does not entirely stop.They feed 
 animals and if crops need urgent      
 attention the farmer goes to do it.   
 They go to Church on Sunday morning.  
 Sunday lunch is usually a traditional 
 meal such as lamb,potatoes,carrots,   
 beans and Yorkshire pudding.If they   
 have any more spare time they sit and 
 read Sunday papers,talk with friends, 
 or pay visits to friends &amp; relatives. </content>
