		<title>05WORKING IN THE NEWQUAY AREA</title>
		<content> The girl who serves food and drink at 
 the{Bay Hotel}in Pentire, has         
 worked there for 8 seasons, each from 
 May to November.  She said she likes  
 her job because she meets different   
 people every day.  She starts work at 
 6pm but has time off in the afternoon.
 Some young people we met were on a    
{Youth Employment Scheme.} This scheme 
 lasts for a year and involves various 
 jobs every day like landscaping,      
 gardening, putting up bus shelters and
 other community work.  The court helps
 pay the wages because many young      
 people can't find jobs.               
 We interviewed a girl who books your  
 holiday at the{Continental Hotel.}She 
 has lived in Newquay for 10 years. She
 likes her job helping her Mum and Dad 
 who own the hotel and employ 18 other 
 people.                               
                                       </content>
