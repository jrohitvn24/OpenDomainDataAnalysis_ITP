		<title>05THE ACLE BY-PASS</title>
		<content> LIKELY THAT THE SOUTHERN ROUTE HAS    
 BEEN CHOSEN BECAUSE IT IS THE SHORTER 
 (AND HENCE CHEAPER) OF THE TWO        
 OPTIONS.THERE IS,HOWEVER,EVERY CHANCE 
 THAT,EVEN AFTER THE NEW ROAD IS BUILT,
 ITS SITING WILL CAUSE CONTROVERSY FOR 
 YEARS TO COME.VILLAGERS POINT OUT THAT
 THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF A         
 DEEP_WATER HARBOUR AT YARMOUTH WILL   
 NECESSITATE FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO   
 THE AREA'S ROADS AND ARE CONCERNED    
 THAT THE RELIEF ROAD WILL ULTIMATELY  
 EVOLVE INTO A MAJOR TRUNK ROAD OR EVEN
 A MOTORWAY.                           
 UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE SITING OF THE   
 BY-PASS AND ITS MAJOR LINK TO THE     
 CAISTER ROAD HAS LED TO A CERTAIN     
 AMOUNT OF "PANIC SELLING" OF LOCAL    
 PROPERTIES,WITH THE INEVITABLE DECLINE
 IN HOUSE PRICES.
