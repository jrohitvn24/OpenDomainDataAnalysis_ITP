		<content>{Exterior of church.}Half of the church
 was built in the 12th.century.The man 
 who was building it had an argument   
 with {Sir Henry Vavasour,}the local   
 landowner who owned the quarry from   
 which the limestone was being used.   
 The argument was because Henry        
 Vavasour wanted his statue on the top 
 niche in the tower but the man who was
 building the church would not allow   
 it.So Sir Henry Vavasour said he could
 not have any more limestone.So the    
 rest of the church was built  with    
 sandstone from another quarry.        
 The clock has a red face one of very  
 few in the country.
