		<title>10Kettlethorpe Local History</title>
		<content> The local history of our area is very 
 varied and interesting. Kettlethorpe  
 takes its name from Ketel the Dane who
 sailed up the Trent in 870 a.d. and   
 had his farm there. Nowadays          
 Kettlethorpe is famous because of its 
 association with Katherine Swynford,  
 the mistress,and third wife of John   
 of Gaunt. All that remains of the     
 fourteenth century manor house is the 
 gateway and portions of the moat, but 
 since publication, in 1954 of Anya    
 Seton's book "Katherine", visitors    
 have comfrom all over the world. The  
 present Hall was rebuilt in 1863, but 
 includes some parts of an older       
 eighteenth century Hall. The church of
 St.Peter and St.Paul, originally a    
 medieval building,was altered and     
 reconstructed in 1809.The graveyard   
 contains several interesting          
 headstones, some as old as 15OO.      </content>
