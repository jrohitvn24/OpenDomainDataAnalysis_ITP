 PRIMARY - At the age of 5 years most  
 of the children go to the designated

 approximately 3 miles away; transport 
 is provided by the Authority.         
 MIDDLE SCHOOL - At 8 years they       
 transfer to Great Horwood Middle      
 School about 5 miles away. Transport  
 is again provided. In the final year  
 the children take the 12 plus exam.   
 SENIOR SCHOOL - If they pass this exam
 they have the opportunity to go to the
 Royal Latin School in Buckingham. The
