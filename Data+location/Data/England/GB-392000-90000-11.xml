		<title>11Industrial Estate</title>
		<content> Over the last few years, an Industrial
 Estate has been developed at{Holton   
{Heath.} The site is important because 
 it is close to{Poole and Wareham. }   
 There is also a railway station and   
 good roads, which are important for   
 transporting the goods made on the    
 Industrial Estate, and for the people 
 employed there.                       
                                       
 The Estate has a wide range of        
 industries, which{employ many people.}
 Not only local people are employed,   
 but people from Bournemouth and Poole.
 The railway station is important for  
 some of the people who travel to the  
 Estate, in the early morning and early
 evening.  However, trains do not      
 normally stop here during the day, or 
 at weekends.
