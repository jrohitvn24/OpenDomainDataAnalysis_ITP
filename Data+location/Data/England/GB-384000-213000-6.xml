		<content> The pottery at Whitely court was      
 started in 1952 by Mr. Loo Groves and 
 Miss Margaret Leach. Both these       
 potters having trained at the St.Ives 
 pottery under Bernard Leach. Margaret 
 left the pottery in 1958 and Mr Groves
 carried on working until his death. In
 1975 when the pottery was taken over  
 by Sean and Vicky Casserly, who both  
 trained at Redruth College of Art in  
 Cornwall. During this time the pottery
 produced has been slip decorated      
 earthenware. The only changes in      
 equipment has been from kick to       
 electric wheels in 1960. And changes  
 to kilns and fuels used oil in 1950's.
 Electric from 1963 to 1979, and LPG.  
 Since then, because of the weakness of
 the local clay. Clay has always been  
 brought in from Stoke_On_Trent, as    
 have glaze materials.
