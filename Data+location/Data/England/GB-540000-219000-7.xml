		<content>   There is a great link between the   
 village school and St. Andrew's       
 Church.The school is called           
 St.Andrew's C. of E. Primary School.  
 The school attends Church at least    
 once every half term. The children    
 walk to Church from the school via    
 Oudle Lane and Church Lane, in their  
 various classes, supervised by their  
 class teachers.A number of the        
 children are members of the Church    
 choir and choir practices are often   
 held in the school hall.              
   At the beginning of this year the   
 church services for several weeks were
 held in the school hall whilst the    
 church roof was treated for death     
 watch beetle.                         
   Being affiliated to the church the  
 school enjoys 2 half-day holidays each
 year; one on Ascension Day and the    
 other on St. Andrew's Day.            </content>
