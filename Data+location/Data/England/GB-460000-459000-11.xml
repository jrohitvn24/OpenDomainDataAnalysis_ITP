		<title>11Amenities in Strensall</title>
		<content> Strensall is well provided for        
 generally, having sufficient shops,   
 doctors and a dentist.  Older people  
 and families without cars rely upon   
 the{village amenities,}the bus fare to
 York being expensive (85p each way    
 adult fare).  A survey of over 60     
 villagers showed that people are happy
 with the amenities. {Further amenities
 people would like included a chemist's
 shop (5 people) and a bank (4 people).
 Other{desirable amenities}mentioned   
 are a hardware store and various      
 recreational facilities, but these    
 were only mentioned by one or two     
 people.  The village's greatest       
{deficiency}does lie in the area of    
{recreation provision.} The amenities  
 used most by the people surveyed were 
 the post office, food shops and       
 doctors', being mentioned by more than
 half of those interviewed.            </content>
