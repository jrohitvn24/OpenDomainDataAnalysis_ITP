		<title>14Ashcott - Community (cont.)</title>
		<content> It is isolated and adjoins the sports 
 fields.Being upon the hill,it attracts
 the cold wind.It is subject to        
{vandalism}and trouble,but despite     
 their efforts,the committee cannot    
 change this. Public{transport }has    
 improved but it is extremely expensive
 and inconvenient to travel by bus,even
 if it is reliable.Most people prefer  
 to travel by car within the village.  
 But industries such as Carpenter's are
 gone,and though the{farms}all remain  
 unchanged,they have no jobs to offer. 
 This explains the absence of certain  
 age groups,who must search for jobs   
 further afield.Most people living in  
 Ashcott work somewhere close such as  
 the shoe businesses in Street.Everyone
 who lives in Ashcott seem to enjoy    
 it.Ashcott is a centre of activity for
 neighbouring villages.It is not rough 
 like the{city.                        </content>
