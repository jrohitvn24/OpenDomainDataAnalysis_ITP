		<content>{TRANSPORT AND ROADS-WHITEGATE.        
 Transport in the area relies solely on
 roads. There is no water transport of 
 any sort and the only railway line    
 closed in 1966 and is now used as a   
 country park. Apart from the main road
 which connects Chester with Winsford  
 and ultimately with the motorway      
 system, the majority of roads in the  
 area are narrow and link in a tight   
 network serving the farms and fields. 
   Unfortunately,these narrow roads are
 inadequate for the increasing amount  
 of traffic which now uses them. Many  
 commuters now use them as a quiet     
 means of crossing the area.Heavy      
 lorries are also becoming more        
 abundent as they transport sand from  
 the sand quarries and potatoes to     
 market. The result has been the       
 imposition of weight limits on a      
 number of local roads.                </content>
