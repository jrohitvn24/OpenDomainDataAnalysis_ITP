		<title>09Hedges and Shrubs</title>
		<content> When you look at a hedge you may think
 that it is all made up of the same    
 sort of woodland plant but this may   
 not be so. Look carefully. Hedges may 
 be made of lots of different kinds of 
 woodland plants. If you wonder how old
 a hedge is, there is a way to         
 calculate it. This is how to do it.   
 You first step out 30 paces and then  
 count how many different kinds of     
 woody shrubs you can see in the 30    
 metres of hedge. Each of these plants 
 represents 100 years of growth. The   
 hedge where I live is approximately   
 400 years old. I surveyed a hedge     
 along the Parish boundary and         
 estimated it to be 400 years old. But 
 I have found an even older hedge. It  
 is a little way down Green Lane and it
 is 700 years old. The shrubs along a  
 30 metre strip are sloe, elder, apple,
 hawthorn, briar rose, damson and ash. </content>
