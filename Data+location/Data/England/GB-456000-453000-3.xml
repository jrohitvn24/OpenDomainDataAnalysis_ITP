		<title>03Ouse River Walk : Skelton</title>
		<content> We walked by the river and could see  
 Clifton Hospital and the Shipton Road 
 to the west and Poppleton over the    
 river to the east. As we walked       
 towards Skelton we saw on our right   
 the new York Outer Ring Road being    
 built. It ended very suddenly and we  
 could see how it was being built up to
 form a ramp to the bridge which is to 
 be built next year. We saw road making
 machinery on the new road and the     
 hard-core stones underneath it. There 
 is a flood-gate to the Ings at Skelton
 and the footpath goes through trees on
 the river bank. We saw a wren and lots
 of other birds in the trees and could 
 small chemicals from the farmer's     
 fields. The river bank curves round   
 towards Nether Poppleton and the      
 footpath goes on to Linton.We saw a   
 hare racing across the meadow and then
 we left the river.                    </content>
