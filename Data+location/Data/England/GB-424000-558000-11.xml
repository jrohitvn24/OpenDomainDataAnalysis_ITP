		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE - G.PAILOR</title>
		<content> My name is Greame Pailor and I am 11  
 years and 8 months old. I live in Low 
 Fell, Gateshead. My usual day goes    
 like this: My father wakes me at 8    
 o'clock. After washing and dressing I 
 go downstairs for breakfast-usually 2 
 pieces of lightly done toast. Then I  
 walk briskly to school and enjoy a    
 game of football. When the whistle is 
 blown at 8.55 I take up position on   
 the stairs. I am a monitor.           
 During the morning we have assembly,  
 maths and subjects like dancing or    
 music. After dinner, which I have at  
 home, we might have lessons like      
 Environmental Studies, Art, Reading or
 P.E. During the evening I like to     
 watch TV, play outside or read. At 9  
 o'clock I have my supper, bedtime     
 being 9.30.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
