{     }This farm belongs to The Youth  
 Custody Centre.  It is worked by the  
 boys under the supervision of the     
 officers.                             
      Most of the farms in the area are
 arable farming, but this farm is      
 mainly livestock.                     
      The farm covers 50 acres.  There 
 are 50 cows which are all Friesians.  
 It is a milking herd.  The calves only
 have their first 24 hours with their  
 mothers. The calves get used to being 
 handled by humans, this makes them    
 easier to handle when they become     
 larger animals.   From April to       
 October the cows eat grass outside.   
 From November to March they eat silage
 indoors.  The silage is made at the   
 farm. The cows are milked for 305     
 days, and 60 days when they are not   
 milked.                               </content>
