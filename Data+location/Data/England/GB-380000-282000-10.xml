		<title>10 Kinver Rock Houses.</title>
		<content>Sandstone 280,000,000 years            
old.The wind has blown the sandstone   
causing  it to lie at different        
angles.Sandstone crumbled away leaving 
big openings in the rock which people  
used to live in until 1950s.One of the 
rock houses is called Holy Austin Rock,
believed to be named after a monk.Nancy
Price,the famous Kinver actress,       
describes in her book'Into an Hour     
Glass'how she used to take her washing 
up to her sisters there.People cultiv- 
ataed their gardens on the slopes of   
which there are still signs.1935 a jug 
of tea cost 2/6,2/-deposit on the jug. 
In recent years vandals have been      
chipping away at the rocks &amp; have      
caused serious rock falls.Now cordoned 
off in danger of being lost.
