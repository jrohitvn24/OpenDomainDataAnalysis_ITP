		<content>     A pond can be found behind the    
 High Street in what was once Charity  
 Meadow. Coot and moorhen can be found 
 here together with sticklebacks,      
 newts, toads and frogs. A stretch of  
 hedging along the High Street is well 
 over a hundred years old. Other       
 hedgerows along farmland could well be
 older. The village has two            
 conservation areas. These are centered
 on the High Street between the        
 junctions with Butchers Lane and      
 Potton Road and including the Chequers
 Inn and parts of Church Lane which    
 include St. Peter's Church and the    
 school.
