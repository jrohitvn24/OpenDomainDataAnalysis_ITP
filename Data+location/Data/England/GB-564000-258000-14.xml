		<content> The{Racing Industry}is very important 
 in this area which lies in the        
 "Golden Triangle" around Newmarket    
 famous for its horsebreeding. Steve   
 Cauthen, rider of the 1985 Derby      
 winner, lives in Stetchworth. There   
 are parts of five studs in our        
 area.Stetchworth Park, Dalham,        
 Derisley Wood, Cheveley Park and      
 Collin.Collin stud, near Stetchworth  
 school, used to breed working horses  
 for the Stetchworth Estate but now,   
 like the others, it breeds            
 thoroughbreds. Formerly called the    
 Aislabie Stud, it has been in         
 existence                             
 for 300 years. This area was first    
 used for horses because the boulder   
 clay land was no good for             
 farming.It is now known that minerals 
 in the soil are good for the healthy  
 growth of horses.                     </content>
