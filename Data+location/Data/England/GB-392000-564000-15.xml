{Katherine Foster Aged 8 yrs.          
 This is a normal Friday for us.We get 
 up at 6.30 am. and read for an hour.  
 The books we read are Famous Five     
 books. Our Favourite one is number    
 three it is "Five Run Away Together". 
 Then we get dressed in different      
 clothes depending on the weather.Then 
 we go down for breakfast.We usually   
 have cereal and sometimes toast.Then  
 we brush our teeth.After that we have 
 our hair brushed.Then we pack our     
 school bags.We put in our recorder,a  
 mauscript book,a pencil case and our  
 lunch box.Then we get into the car and
 go to school and play tuggy outside   
 till it is time to go in.Our teacher  
 does the register then we learn the   
 hymms for hymn practise.We have our   
 milk and then go out to play.After    
 play we work until hymn practise time.</content>
