		<content> Astley Hall  (1)                      
 This mansion was presented to the town
of Chorley by Reginald A.Tatton of     
Cuerden. The original hall was an      
Elizabethan half timbered structure    
grouped around a central court and     
dating from about 1580. In 1666        
extensive rebuilding was carried out,  
the front part of the hall was pulled  
down and rebuilt on a more lavish scale
in the Jacobean style.At the same time 
a long gallery was added.              
 The hall contains a unique collection 
of furniture, including two items      
worthy of special mention. One is the  
very fine Elizabethan bed, known       
locally as the Cromwell bed (Oliver    
Cromwell is supposed to have slept in  
it) .The other is the famous shovel    
board table in the Long Gallery.
