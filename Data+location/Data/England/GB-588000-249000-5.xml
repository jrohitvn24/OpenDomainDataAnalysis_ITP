		<title>05The De Vere House</title>
		<content>The De Vere is in Water Street.It was  
built in the 1400s.Over the front door 
you can see the Star and Boar of the De
Vere family.The house fell into ruins  
and was rebuilt in the 1920s.The bricks
between the beams are modern and called
brick-hogging.                         
 There is a large pointed front door,  
with a smaller door in the middle.The  
stairs once used to be a chimney.The   
front bedroom has a sloping floor and  
large carved beams.There is a blocked  
window in the sitting-room where       
another house was built on,for a       
relation of the De Vere family.        
 A stream runs underneath the front of 
the house.This stream provided water   
for washing and there were steps down  
to the water in the High Street,at the 
site of the present-day bus shelter.
