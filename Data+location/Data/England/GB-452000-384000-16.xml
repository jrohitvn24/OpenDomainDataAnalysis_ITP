		<title>16The Miner's Strike (Cont)</title>
		<content> to end the long, devastating pit      
 strike. After hours of talks the{end  
 of the pit strike was announced. Most 
 miners returned to work the following 
 Tuesday. Even now that the pit strike 
 had finished the miners who had stayed
 out treated the{scabs}as if they      
 weren't there, never speaking to them 
 and sometimes refusing to work with   
 them. After the pit strike the pit    
 closures were announced. Many people  
 realised that{Arthur Scargill}was     
 right in calling a national strike.   
 The pits had lost many millions of    
 pounds worth of coal because of the   
 pit strike.  The miners lost because  
 not all the miners were on strike and 
 there was plenty of coal to be moved  
 around. On top of this oil was used to
 replace coal.
