		<content>  The research for this survey was     
 carried out by the pupils of{Rosliston
{C.E.Primary School,South Derbyshire,  
 which is a small rural school of 70   
 pupils.                               
  The children involved were from{Class
{Two}and ranged between 7 and 9 years  
 of age.As the children were so young, 
 most of the text was prepared by their
 teacher,{Mrs.A.M.Pope.}               
  We should like to thank the people   
 who helped us,especially Mrs.Walley,  
 Mrs.Goodall and Mrs.Griffiths for     
 providing both transport and          
 information.                          
  We are also grateful to{Mr.Tweats }  
 for answering his son{David's         
 questions about a day in his busy     
 life.
