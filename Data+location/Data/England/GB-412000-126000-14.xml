		<content>   Rolling downland and river valleys  
 contrast with the suburbs of Harnham. 
 The Avon here is liable to flood and  
 areas of wetland wilst the Ebble, a   
 small chalkstream only flows strongly 
 in the winter. Although there is      
 woodland on the Radnor estate &amp; other 
 small woodland areas exist elsewhere  
 have been reduced to aid farming. In  
 the northern third of the area new    
 estates &amp; infilling have extened the  
 Harnham suburbs towards the watershed 
 between the Avon &amp; the Ebble. Small   
 housing development have occured in   
 the Ebble valley villages. Open       
 countryside has been further reduced  
 by the Odstock Hospital extension &amp;   
 the improvement of road junctions &amp;   
 carriageways.
