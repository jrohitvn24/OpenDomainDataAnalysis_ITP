		<content>The western suberbs are residential.The
oldest houses are Victorian,built      
betwee 1854-91.These are mansions,semi-
detached and detached villas and       
terraced houses.They are built of red  
brick and have slate roofs.The oldest  
of the small houses have flat sash     
windows and no front gardens,the later 
ones have bay windows and small front  
gardens.Some have name plates above the
door,often with the date when they were
built.The terreced houses have a       
covered entry leading to the back;they 
have no garages.The mansions have      
extensive woodland grounds sloping down
over a sandstone ridge.The mansions are
no longer used as single residences.One
has been changed into a private        
hospital. others have been turned into 
flats or have had houses built in their
gardens.One was demolished and 22      
houses were built in its place.        </content>
