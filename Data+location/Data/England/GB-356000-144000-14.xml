		<title>14EAST HORRINGTON</title>
		<content> East Horrington lies on an ancient    
 beach onthe southern flank of The     
 Mendips. Many of the houses in this   
 small hamlet have extensive views over
 the Somerset levels. The two most     
 distinguished buildings are the church
 which is no longer in use and Chilcote
 Manor which was a prebendal manor i.e.
 belonging to the Cathedral. Recently, 
 several of the former agricultural    
 buildings have been renovated to      
 provide attractive homes for newcomers
 to the village. Development of the    
 village has extended down the road to 
 Wells where some houses have been     
 built for people employed at the      
 Mendip Hospital.
