		<title>03ROOTS OF MODERN BLACKPOOL</title>
		<content> Blackpool as such is the result of the
 gradual development and merging of    
 a number of small village nuclei      
 during the 19th.and early             
 20th.centuries.Two of these early     
 settlements,{Little &amp; Great Marton}lie
 within the survey area on the Northern
 &amp; Western edges of the former{Marton  
{Moss.}Much of the mossland has been   
 reclaimed over the years for          
 development as building land or for   
 farming.                              
 Little Marton boasts the last         
 remaining {windmill}in Blackpool,a    
 relic of the past when the mosslands  
 were a large grain-growing area.The   
 region was at one time known as{      
{'Windmill Land'}.The original area of 
 moss can still be ascertained by      
 examining the main road pattern of the
 area which avoids any direct traverse.
