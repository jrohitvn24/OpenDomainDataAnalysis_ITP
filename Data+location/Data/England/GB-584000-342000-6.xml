		<title>06OVERY SEASHORE WILDLIFE</title>
		<content> Most Overy wildlife lives on the marsh
 and seashore.  In summer there is a   
 wide variety of crabs, shell creatures
 and birds.  The crabs which are edible
 are further out to sea and the gillies
 which are usually found in damp places
 are under stones when the tide is out.
 If you go on to the beach and look for
 holes in the sand and a worm cast     
 these are the markings of a lugworm   
 which are usually used for bait when  
 going fishing.  At the end of summer  
 there are a lot of jellyfish as small 
 as a 50p coin.  Cuttle fish are rare  
 to find near the shore but you can    
 find their bones in the tide line     
 amongst seaweeds which have been      
 washed up by the tide.  Flat Fish,    
 Bass Mullet and Sea Trout come in     
 through the Creek at Burnham Overy.
