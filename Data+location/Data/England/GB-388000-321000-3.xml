           Rowley Park is on           
Highfields Estate,it is owned by       
Stafford Borough  Council.It is about  
36 acres and 30 years old.Rowley Park  
has a lot of facilities like Tennis,   
Bowls,Golf,Running,Highjump,Longjump,  
Cricket,Hurdles,Football,Hockey and    
Rugby,and also a playground for small  
children.                              
           We went to the Park to      
interview a groundsman who does jobs   
around the park. We asked him what he  
thaught of his job.He said that it was 
good in Summer but bad in Winter.He    
said that up to 300 people use the park
when activities are on,during the week 
only a few people go.He also told us   
that they do get vandals but the damage
is not serious.
