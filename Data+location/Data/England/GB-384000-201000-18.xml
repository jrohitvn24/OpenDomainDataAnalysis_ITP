		<content>{Old and New School,Kingscourt.        
         There has been a school at    
 Kingscourt,Stroud since 1837.It was   
 originally built as a church school   
 for local Non-Conformist families.    
 The old school closed in l970, but    
 many people remember their days there 
 with pleasure. Several old pupils     
 remember back to the time around World
 War l. For some this was their only   
 experience of school life.Teachers    
 were liked and respected but very     
 strict.No-one talked in lessons and   
 the cane was often used.Water was     
 often brought from a spring and       
 heating by a coke stove.Children      
 hauled library books up from the      
 station on a hand cart.On May Day     
 children decked gates with leaves to  
 greet the teachers.The new larger     
 school called Gastrells was built     
 close by.It has l40 pupils.           </content>
