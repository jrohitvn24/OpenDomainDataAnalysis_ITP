		<content>   As an adult in Cherry Willingham    
 there are a range of activities. Since
 most adults work in Lincoln at the    
 light engineering or electronics      
 factories life in the week revolves   
 around the home except for those who  
 either go to evening institute or     
 belong to clubs. Both of these groups 
 meet either at the school or at the   
 local village hall. Most people who go
 to the pub leave it until after about 
 9.30pm. and both pubs in the area and 
 the one in Reepham out of the block   
 enjoy a group of regular customers.   
   Weekends are taken up with diverse  
 activities although gardening must be 
 labelled as a common activity and the 
 gardens reflect this care. Major      
 entertainment is found in Lincoln and 
 this often is at the expense of local 
 groups like the dramatic society.
