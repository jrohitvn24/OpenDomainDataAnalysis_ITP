{   ____________________________}      
  There are a variety of domestic fuels
 used in Owston and the surrounding    
 area but the chief, and most important
 source of energy is electricity. All  
 houses are lighted by it and several  
 use it for cooking,warmth and water   
 heating. It is extensively used on the
 farms and, because of its importance, 
 two farms own generators which are    
 used in the event of mains failure and
 which are lent out in emergency.      
                                       
  Other domestic fuels are wood, solid 
 fuel, calor gas and oil. One house has
 straw-burning equipment for heating   
 and another has solar panels. vehicles
 are run on petrol or diesel; all fuels
 , whether domestic or for transport,  
 have to be obtained from outside the  
 village.Coal and oil are delivered.   </content>
