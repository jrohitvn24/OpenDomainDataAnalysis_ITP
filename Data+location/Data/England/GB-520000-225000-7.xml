 He was a nice man and after his death 
 they named a Wood after him called {  
{Lucas Wood}and a pub called {Hermit of
{Redcoats.}Just down the road, near the
 woods, is a little pond with{frogs}and
{great crested newts}and in the middle 
 of the  pond is a big  oak tree.It is 
 surprising even though it had oil in  
 the pond that nothing seems to die.   
{JAMES}lived in the kitchen for the    
 rest of his life.Young children got   
 money from him and the next day the   
 children would come and torment him.In
 the summer me and my friends play     
 50-50 in the woods and sometimes make 
 camps.The wood has{ROBINS,RABBITS,    
{SQUIRRELS}AND OTHER SMALL WILD        
 CREATURES.
