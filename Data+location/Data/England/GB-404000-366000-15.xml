		<title>15Wild Flowers</title>
		<content>Wild flowers are living in             
Hollinsclough because they do not get  
disturbed. Fields on steep hillsides   
are not fertilized or reseeded.        
Also the Peak National Park was set up 
to care for the countryside, plants and
animals. Two ecologists came to        
school and we visited five different   
sites to see wild flowers on Hollins   
hill we saw several large fairy rings  
purple orchids and wild pansies.In the 
reseeded field were lots of docks and  
dandelions .We went onto High Edge a   
limestone pavement lots of wood sorrel 
grows in the cracks .Lower down the    
hill by the stream we found many       
flowers bitter vetch, violet,          
double-sided saxifrage, marsh valarian,
lady's smock, marsh marigold, primrose,
bluebell and many others.              
It is a good thing to be in the        
National Park,we are lucky to live here</content>
