		<content> War over, the R.A.F. base was con-    
 verted to a{grass drying plant}to     
 produce much needed{protein.}It was   
 later bought by the late Lord Melchett
 and became known as{British Field     
{Products Ltd.}A finance company -     
 Samuels Merchant Bankers - became     
 involved and the company expanded.    
 Gaining the assets of a small Animal  
 Feeds and Grain Merchants Company at  
 North Elmham known as R.J.Seaman, it  
 was decided to produce animal feeds at
 B.F.P. and a small pilot plant was    
 installed. The company was taken over 
 by the present owners, Guardian Royal 
 Exchange, and the site name changed to
{R.J.Seaman and Sons Ltd.}The mill was 
 enlarged in 1968 and grass drying     
 ceased in the late 70s. In 1980 a new,
 fully computerised mill was built and 
 in 1981 the original mill was         
 enlarged.                             </content>
