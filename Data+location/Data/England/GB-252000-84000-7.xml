		<title>07Dartmoor Letterboxes</title>
		<content>   One hobby pursued by some on        
 Dartmoor is searching for a{Dartmoor  
{Letterbox.}These are not red metal    
 objects, but are rubber stamps        
 contained in ammunition boxes or      
 plastic boxes that are hidden on the  
 moor. It may seem a daft hobby, but it
 is fun.                               
   In order to find one of the letter  
 boxes, unless one is very lucky, one  
 must have clues. These can vary from  
 the explicit, such as the one of the  
 box near Widgery Cross; "{From cross  
{go 125paces on 127 degrees to three   
{upright stones of hip height. Box is  
{10ft below." }to the clue for the {   
{Belstone Box; "15 yds below upright   
{stone on West side of the tor"        
{ }Thus in order to find one of these  
 boxes one must walk, navigate, and    
 enjoy one of the beautiful parts of   
 the British Countryside.              </content>
