		<title>19SITE OF THE BATTLE OF STOKE</title>
		<content> The villagers of{East Stoke}are       
 preparing to celebrate the 500th      
 anniversary of the{Battle of Stoke }  
 (or {Stoke Field)}with a week of      
 celebrations in 1987.  They held a    
 medieval banquet in the summer of 1985
 as a prelude to the main festivities. 
   The site of the battle is thought to
 be on the Trent Hills between{Stoke}  
 and{Elston.}A stone in the hedgerow of
 a field on the brow of the hill reads:
   HERE STOOD THE BURRAND BUSH         
   PLANTED ON THE SPOT WHERE HENRY VII 
   RAISED HIS STANDARD AFTER THE BATTLE
   OF STOKE           16th JUNE 1487   
 This marked the end of the{Wars of the
{Roses.}The vast army raised by the    
 pretender,{Lambert Simnel,}was driven 
 down the hill towards{Fiskerton.}A    
 local stream ran with blood, and has  
 since been known as the{'Red Gutter', 
{'Red Dyke',}or{'Bloody Gutter'.       </content>
