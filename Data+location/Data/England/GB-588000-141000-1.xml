		<content>  The area covers Smarden east of the  
 church, a part of Bethersden around   
 Tuesnoad &amp; Wissenden and a few acres  
 of Pluckley near the brickworks.      
 Smarden, a typical picturesque Wealden
 village with 13th century church,     
 white weatherboarded &amp; half timbered  
 houses, is visited and photographed by
 many English &amp; overseas tourists. The 
 Chequers &amp; Flying Horse pubs, selling 
 Kentish ale, are very popular. There  
 are 271 properties of which 64 are    
 known to be rented. 143 properties are
 detached. During the year at least 16 
 properties have been for sale at      
 prices from Â£50,000. A population     
 count in August revealed 157 persons  
 under 18 and 575 adults of whom 159   
 were senior citizens, 26 of the latter
 being residents of the old people's   
 home. There have been 4 deaths and no 
 births in the year.                   </content>
