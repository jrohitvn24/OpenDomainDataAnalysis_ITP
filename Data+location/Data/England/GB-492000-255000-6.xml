       Shops in Harrold contd.         
 The other shop on the Green is also a 
 general and grocery store.It is a     
 newsagents and a Sub Post Office. Many
 more people visit this shop on a      
 regular basis&lt;18 out of 2O surveyed>  
 because of the facilities provided.   
                                       
 These two small country shops appear  
 to be very popular and are a focal    
 point for the village. However most   
 people surveyed stated that they did  
 not do their main shopping there,     
 preferring to visit Bedford or        
 Northampton for the supermarkets etc. 
                                       
 Only two people in our survey used the
 bus service into Bedford, the others  
 preferring to travel there mainly at  
 weekends by car.
