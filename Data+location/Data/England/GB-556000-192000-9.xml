 Osyth's Abbey built it in 1221. Wistan
 Boune closed it in 1575 but the town  
 objected and 30 women sat in there    
 which saved it. Its surviving records 
 date from 1694.{St Thomas the Martyr  
{Church}built in 1835 300m from the    
 chapel. It was of white brick and had 
 a square tower. In 1837 Brentwood was 
 made a district chapelry.             
{St.Thomas of Canterbury}built of flint
 with stone dressings in 1883 over the 
 old church. A new tower and spire were
 added in 1886.                        
{St.Helen's R.C.Cathedral}originally   
 'The Sacred Heart of St. Helen'was    
 opened in 1837. It became a school in 
 1861 and another church was built. In 
 1917 when Brentwood became a Catholic 
 diocese it became a Cathedral. By 1981
 it was only dedicated to St. Helen. An
 extension was built in 1972.          </content>
