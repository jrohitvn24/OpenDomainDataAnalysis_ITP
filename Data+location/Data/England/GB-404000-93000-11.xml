		<title>11A 1980'S HOUSE</title>
		<content> THE OUTSIDE                           
 Houses are made of brick which are    
 stuck together with cement. There are 
 glass windows and a wooden door. Some 
 houses are attached others detached.  
 THE GARDEN                            
 Most gardens have grassy lawns with   
 some flowers. There might be a shed ( 
 a small wooden hut for keeping working
 tools in) or a garage (a building to  
 keep a car in).                       
 THE INSIDE                            
 Most houses are one or two storeys    
 high; each storey has about four to   
 six rooms. On the top floor are the   
 bedrooms, toilets and bathrooms. On   
 the lower floor is a kitchen, dining  
 room and living room/lounge.
