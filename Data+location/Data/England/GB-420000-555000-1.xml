		<content> Our area of study is geographically   
 situated to the west of the{TEAM      
{VALLEY TRADING ESTATE}in the COUNTY of
{TYNE and WEAR.}This predominantly     
 rural area, consists mainly of small  
 isolated farms and several areas of   
 woodland.The main Sunniside to Stanley
 road, the{A6076}runs through the area.
   The area supports a link with the   
 past days of steam through the running
 of the old Sunniside to Tanfield      
 Railway, kept alive by enthusiasts,   
 during the summer months.Included in  
 the area is the famous{CAUSEY ARCH}the
 oldest railway viaduct in the world.  
   It is a sparsely populated area with
 ample opportunity to take advantage of
 leisure pursuits,including rock       
 climbing, discovering the origins of  
 our present day railway system,and    
 walking along the many foot and bridle
 paths.                                </content>
