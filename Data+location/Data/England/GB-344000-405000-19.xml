		<content>                                       
   The Trim Trail is an exercise course
 set in an open space or park.It is    
 sited near to the River Tawd in the   
 Tawd Valley.This is the largest open  
 space in our town.                    
   The course has 11 obstacles _       
 including a warm_up area,leapfrog     
 poles and a water crossing.All the    
 obstacles are made of timber to fit in
 with the landscape.It costs nothing to
 use and is good fun.Some of the       
 obstacles are difficult but others are
 easier.At each one there is a plaque  
 which tells you how many exercises to 
 do if you are a beginner or a very    
 fit person.                           
   The parkland around is very quiet   
 and pleasant.There is a walkway along 
 the side of the river and a Nature    
 Trail is being established along the  
 wooded valley.                        </content>
