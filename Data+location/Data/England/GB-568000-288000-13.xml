		<title>13A FENLAND GAMEKEEPER'S DAY</title>
		<content>   I get up at four, have a cup of tea,
 feed the chickens and ducks, then I go
 to the rearing field and feed the     
 pheasants. Then I let them into the   
 bigger pens. Next I feed the bigger   
 ducks on the water at Fletchers. I    
 come home, go to bed for two hours and
 wake Sally up at seven o'clock. At    
 8.15 I take Sally to school and get   
 the newspapers and read them. Then I  
 have a look round the farm and check  
 the traps to see if there is anything 
 in them. Then I come home and go to   
 sleep. When I wake up I go to see     
 Malcolm to tell him if I need         
 anything. When Sally comes home I take
 her to see the birds. Then we have    
 some tea and watch television. Then I 
 go and look round and when I come home
 I get changed and go to the Ex-Service
 men's club. When I come home I go and 
 shut up the pheasants and ducks.      </content>
