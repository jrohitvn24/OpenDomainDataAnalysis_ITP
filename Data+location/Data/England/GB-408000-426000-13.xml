		<content>  My name is James Bottomley and I go  
 to Salterlee School, Shibden. On      
 Monday the 6th May we had a holiday   
 from school. In the morning I got up, 
 got dressed and had my breakfast, then
 set off for Leeds University, to have 
 a good time with some other children  
 from our church. In the group I was   
 the leader, Phil, played a 12 stringed
 guitar. We practised a play, then went
 for our dinner, but not in the dining 
 room because it was packed, so we sat 
 in our car. Then we explored the      
 university. We saw a massive snake,   
 and a lizard and some other reptiles. 
 After we had watched my Mum sing in   
 the choir we went home.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
