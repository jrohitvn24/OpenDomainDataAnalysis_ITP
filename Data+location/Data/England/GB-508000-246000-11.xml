		<title>11Cople Lower School</title>
		<content>    This  5-9  lower  school was built 
 in 1868.There are two classes for the 
 53 children.  The  school  they  will 
 be  going  to  next  is  Abbey Middle 
 School at Elstow.  The  school  is in 
 good  condition considering its  age, 
 but the inside needs painting.        
                                       
    They  have  a  swimming  pool  for 
 learners,a library and a computer but 
 they have no playing field. They  use 
 the village field  in Grange Lane.The 
 school  has   close   ties  with  the 
 playgroup,and over 60's club.         
                                       
    The pre-school playgroup visits for
 the concerts held every year.The vicar
 takes  assembly  every  other Tuesday.
 Most  of  the  children live in Cople,
 (1lives  in  Cardington, 2 in Northill
 and 2 in Great Barford).
