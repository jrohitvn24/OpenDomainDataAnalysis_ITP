		<content> There is a{Primary School             
 for about 70 children, aged 5 to 11   
 with a lively Parent/Teachers         
 Association. The building is an       
 ancient, thatched, former Poorhouse,  
 extensively modernised within.        
 At 11+ the children go by school bus  
 to Queen Elizabeth's {Comprehensive   
{School}in Crediton. A few parents send
 their children to{independent}        
 preparatory and former "Direct Grant" 
 schools in Exeter and Tiverton,       
 including a very few boarders.        
 In{1925}and earlier the village       
 school took all ages, 5 to 14, with   
 some infants even younger. Parents who
 sent their children (on bicycles) to  
 the Boys' or Girls' High Schools in   
 Crediton paid 4 guineas a term.       
 In{1905}the headmaster ran some       
 evening classes for adults.
