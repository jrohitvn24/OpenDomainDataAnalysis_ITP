		<title>14A1 ROUNDABOUT WETHERBY</title>
		<content>  Due to the high volume of traffic    
 using the Wetherby roundabout (the    
 junction of the A58 and A1), it has   
 become a notorious accident blackspot.
 A proposal has been made to re-route  
 the A1 at this point, as part of the {
{Kirkhamgate-Dishforth Scheme}(to link 
 the M1 south of Leeds to the A1 near  
 Wetherby). The new route, avoiding    
 the roundabout, will follow the       
 existing A1 until \ a mile south of   
 the roundabout where it will curve    
 eastwards through Grange Park,        
 crossing the River Wharfe over a new  
 bridge, passing west of the race-     
 course to rejoin the A1 north of the  
 York Road flyover. If approved the    
 project should commence in the late   
 1980's. Several environmental pressure
 groups and local land-owners have     
 opposed the scheme but it would appear
 to be the most realistic solution.    </content>
