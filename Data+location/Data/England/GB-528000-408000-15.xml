		<title>15A SAXON CHURCH IN GRIMSBY</title>
		<content>{Holy Trinity and the Virgin Mary},Old 
 Clee has a{Saxon tower}built of stone 
 collected from the shore and built in{
{1050.}It is not listed in {Domesday.} 
 We think the church had been destroyed
 in a{Viking raid}as it was made of    
 wattle and daub.Only the tower        
 remained.A new stone church was built 
 by the{Normans}in 1192.A tablet on one
 of the Norman arches says that it was 
 reopened by{Hugh,Bishop of Lincoln.}  
 Stained glass altar windows show Hugh 
 and King Richard as clues.The{Grant   
{Thorold's}of Weelsby Hall were local  
 landowners.They gave money to{restore}
 the church in the{19th Century.}We    
 found a{memorial}to them.Their {vault}
 is under the floor.It is called{'The  
{Brides Church'}because many want to   
 marry there.A{past mayor}planted a new
 elm in the well-kept churchyard.there 
 are no burials there now.             </content>
