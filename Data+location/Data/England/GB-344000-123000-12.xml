 l975, it houses the infant section. At
 the old end the playground is tarmac, 
 and is used by the netball team.      
 Football, cricket and rounders are    
 played on the grass pitch at the new  
 end, where there is also a shallow    
 swimming pool. Athletics, chess, drama
 and cycling proficiency are amongst   
 the after-school clubs. There are lll 
 children in 4 classes at the school,  
 and about half have sandwiches. The   
 cooked lunch yesterday was egg and    
 cheese salad followed by chocolate    
 sponge and custard. Playground games  
 include football, skipping,           
 stilt-walking, padder-tennis, and     
 playing on the climbing frame and in  
 the sandpit.                          </content>
