		<content> One of the old ladies who lives at the
 Grange residential home is{Miss Rees  
{Webbe.}She is{97}years old.When she   
 was young,women were not allowed to   
 vote. Miss Rees Webbe joined a band of
 women called the suffragettes.This    
 band of women did not think it was    
 fair that women could not vote so they
 decided to persuade the government to 
 change their minds.Miss Rees Webbe    
 even threw a brick through the Home   
 Office window -for that she was put in
 prison for 10 days. While she was in  
 prison they force fed her.They stuck  
 tubes down her neck because she       
 refused to eat.                       
 In the end they made the government   
 change their minds and that is why    
 women can vote today.She showed us her
 photographs and a letter from Mrs.    
 Thatcher.Miss Rees Webbe{died}at the  
 Grange on{Saturday,13th July 1985.    </content>
