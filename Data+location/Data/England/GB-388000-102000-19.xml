		<title>19CHILD'S DAY IN CHARLTON</title>
		<content> On Sunday mornings I get out of bed   
 and go downstairs at 7 o'clock and    
 wake my brother up. We watch some     
 television till 8.3O. After breakfast 
 I go and get ready for gymnastics,then
 I go to see if my friend would like to
 play with me.At 11.OO I go to         
 gymnastics till 12.OO. After lunch I  
 sometimes go up to play with Lily and 
 we play with the kittens and on bikes.
 I go home at teatime and I go and see 
 if Lisa would like to play again. We  
 play in the garden until it is 7.45,  
 then I have to go home to get ready   
 for bed. I have a chat with Mum and   
 Dad and at 8 o'clock I go to bed.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
