		<content> A survey in Pilsley Primary School    
 showed that most families took their  
 holidays on the East Coast, especially
 at Skegness. This is probably due to  
 ease of travel, plenty of caravan and 
 chalet accommodation and the existence
 of the Miners' Holiday Camp.          
 Other East Coast resorts visited were 
 Scarborough, Bridlington, Cleethorpes 
 and Great Yarmouth.                   
                                       
 Any holidays on the North West Coast  
 were mainly taken at Blackpool.       
 Other holiday areas visited were the  
 South Coast and the West Country.     
 Almost without exception, holidays are
 taken by the sea, probably owing to   
 our home area being so far inland.    
 Holidays abroad are rare.
