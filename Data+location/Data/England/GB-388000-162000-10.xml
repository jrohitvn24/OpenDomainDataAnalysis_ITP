		<title>10HOUSING IN MELKSHAM</title>
		<content>   The oldest houses in Melksham are   
 around St.Michael's church and were   
 built in the 18th and 19th centuries. 
 Some of the older houses have been    
 altered so that they are exactly the  
 same as they were.  Melksham has some 
 attractive limestone houses too.      
   Building sites have recently been   
 popping up all over the place.  My    
 friend Bradley lives opposite a       
 building site in Bowerhill where 160  
 houses of different shapes and sizes  
 are being built.  On the by-pass there
 are new houses (mostly 3 and 4        
 bedrooms) which will be finished in   
 1990.  Finally, on the site which used
 to be the feather factory, there are  
 new red-bricked houses designed       
 largely for first-time buyers.
