		<content>  Corvedale Church of England Aided    
 school started in the year 1982 the   
 month of March.Four schools came      
 together to make one big school.The   
 schools were Stanton Lacy, Culmington,
 Diddlebury and Munslow village        
 schools.                              
  Stanton Lacy school had only 12      
 pupils so those 12 pupils and 2       
 teachers went to Culmington village   
 school.Diddlebury school had to be    
 made bigger to fit in four schools so 
 the children from Diddlebury went to  
 Munslow school.                       
  Mr R.P.Bray became the first head    
 teacher of the new school, Miss L.    
 Rawlings the teacher of the middle    
 class and Mrs James the teacher       
 of the first class.Mrs Stephenson     
 taught part-time until 1984, then she 
 became a full-time teacher for the top
 class.                                </content>
