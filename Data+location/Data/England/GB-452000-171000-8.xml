		<title>08FARMING IN FRILSHAM (2)</title>
		<content> Milk production is the main source of 
 income such as those in this area.It  
 has been rising in recent years. In   
 response to pressure from the{European
{Economic Community}the Government has 
 imposed{quotas}on farmers- 10% less   
 than the year before. There is a total
 quota on the whole country  with a    
 complicated system of assessment and  
 computation. A farmer is fined 17     
 pence for every excess litre of milk. 
 The small farmers' lobby is very      
 strong in the European Community. In  
 Britain family farmers like those in  
 Frilsham are at risk.{Cereal prices}  
 have been dropping owing to bumper    
 harvests in 1983-84 with large grain  
 mountains building up and a consequent
 fall in prices for the farmer. This   
 grain and milk could feed starving    
 people in Africa and elsewhere.
