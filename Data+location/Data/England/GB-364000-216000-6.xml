		<title>06POPULATION OF MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>    The gradual closing down of the    
 local mines and other traditional     
 industries of the area in the early   
 and middle part of the 20th century   
 led to a decline in the importance of 
 Mitcheldean, so that by 1958 the      
 population had dropped to around 800. 
 After this date the expansion of the  
 Rank Xerox factory led to much new    
 building. A council estate was        
 followed by two private estates, one  
 of considerable size. This attracted  
 many newcomers, not only from other   
 local towns and villages, but from    
 many parts of the British Isles. A    
 survey amongst a group of             
 schoolchildren showed that out of     
 every 7 families, 3 families had moved
 into Mitcheldean from outside the     
 Forest of Dean area within the last 12
 years.
