		<title>02ATTITUDES IN MARSKE AREA.</title>
		<content> A feeling of satisfaction felt by     
 residents at living in such an area.  
 Two types of people Farmers &amp;         
 'Incomers'living in happy association.
 Farmers fear decline in agriculture. A
 general opposition to Land            
 Nationalisation. Local farming        
 practices not considered a threat to  
 the environment. Some grumbles about  
 new farm buildings, state of roads,   
 game shooting, army lorries &amp;         
 helicopters. Older people well        
 occupied; most have cars &amp; so not     
 confined to area. Very old feel they  
 can cope. Few money worries. Parents  
 think integration with urban          
 conditions will be easier for their   
 children now being educated in towns. 
 Have good opinion of schools. Some    
 young people feel that more building  
 might be a means of extending village 
 life.                                 </content>
