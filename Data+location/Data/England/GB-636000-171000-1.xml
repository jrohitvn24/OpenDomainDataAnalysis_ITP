		<content>      This is the North Coast of the   
 Isle of Thanet in the North East      
 corner of Kent or the South East      
 corner of Britain. Only part of four  
 squares is land, the rest is sea.     
      Much of the land at the top of   
 the cliffs has been left clear of     
 buildings so providing public access  
 and good views for the summer         
 visitors. Inland in the west is a     
 great cluster of hotels and guest     
 homes. Eastward the more recent       
 building has been of homes so there is
 an interesting progression of         
 architectural styles.                 
      The headland and lighthouse of   
 North Foreland is further around the  
 corner.There is a coastguard station  
 at Foreness Point. At the same point  
 is the crude sewage outlet pipe which 
 is currently being renewed in an      
 effort to keep the beaches clean.     </content>
