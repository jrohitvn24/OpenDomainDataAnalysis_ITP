		<content> The area lies almost exclusively      
 within the Peak District National     
 Park, bordering with the outskirts of 
 the villages of Marsden and Melthem.  
 The most striking features of the     
 area are the Wessenden Reservoirs,    
 namely Butterly, Blakeley and         
 Wessenden. The rest of the area       
 consists predominantly of moorland    
 whose high point can be found at West 
 Nab(500m) in the south east corner of 
 our area. Almost all of the eastern   
 half of the area lies over 400m. The  
 whole area experiences a high         
 precipitation level 1300mm. to 1500mm.
 per year. The winds are generally     
 westerly although occasional          
 Easterlies cause some of the heavy    
 winter snow. The area can become      
 isolated in winter due to heavy       
 snowfall.
