		<title>19The View from our School</title>
		<content> We are very lucky at our school as we 
 have a beautiful view from 6 out of   
 the 8 classrooms. The land around     
 Exmouth slopes gently up from the sea 
 in a NE direction and Brixington      
 School is nearly on top of a hill,    
 half a Km from Woodbury Common. On a  
 clear day you can see as far as{Berry 
{Head}near{Brixham}and up the coast to 
{Torquay, Teignmouth, Dawlish Warren   
 and on up the{Exe estuary.}At night   
 the view is scattered with thousands  
 of lights shining in each town on the 
 far coast and the lighthouse on Berry 
 Head winks in the distance. Inland    
 from the coast we can see the{Haldon  
{Hills.}Exmouth town centre is about 3 
 Km from school but looks much closer  
 as we are up above it. We watch ships 
 in{Lyme Bay}waiting to enter{Exmouth  
{docks}and small motor boats and       
 dinghies moored off{Shelly Beach.     </content>
