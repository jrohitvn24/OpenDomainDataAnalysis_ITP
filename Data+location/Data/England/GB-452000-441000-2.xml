		<title>02APPLETON ROEBUCK LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>   The{land}is low lying and undulating
 rising gently northwards from 8 metres
 at Bolton Percy and 9 metres at       
 Appleton Roebuck to 15 metres at      
 Brumber Hill and Colton Bridge.       
   Sparse{settlement}is focussed on two
 villages,Appleton Roebuck,Bolton Percy
 and  the hamlets of  Holme Green and  
 Colton Bridge.Population is           
 approximately 1000.                   
   Surface{drainage}is by many ditches 
 and land drains which connect to two  
 natural becks,the{ "the Foss" }which  
 flows to the west and south of Bolton 
 and{ "the Fleet"} which passes to the 
 east of Appleton.     Both streams are
 tributaries of{"the Wharfe"}which they
 join at Nun Appleton and are subject  
 to winter flooding, though the Fleet  
 has been widened and deepened.  The   
 surface rock is Boulder Clay and has  
 poor natural drainage.                </content>
