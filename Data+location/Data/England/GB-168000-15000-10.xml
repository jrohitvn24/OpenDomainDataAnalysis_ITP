		<title>10Employment around Ruan Minor</title>
		<content> Employment varies a lot around Ruan   
 Minor.When we asked the children in   
 our school what their parents did for 
 an occupation there was no one        
 occupation that most people seemed to 
 do.Many of the mothers were housewives
 though some would work in the summer  
 because of the tourists.There were    
 quite a few fathers who were connected
 with the building industry. There were
 also a few farmers and farmworkers.   
 Some people work at Goonhilly which is
 an earth satellite station.There were 
 a few parents who were unemployed.    
 There is a small fishing industry at  
 Cadgwith and some fathers were        
 fishermen.A few people worked in      
 shops.There are no big factories      
 around because it is very isolated.   
 The nearest city from here is about 25
 miles away called Truro.
