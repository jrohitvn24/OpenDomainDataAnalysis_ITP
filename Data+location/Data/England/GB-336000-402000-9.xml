		<content> Mrs Townley also remembers when the   
 Meadows pub had a bowling green.The   
 people who built it said it could not 
 be used for 2 years but the people of 
 Maghull insisted.Hitler finished it   
 off by dropping a bomb on it during   
 the war and now it is used as a car   
 park.                                 
 When local farmers were ready to lift 
 their potatoes they did not have      
 enough pickers as so many men had gone
 off to war.To solve the problem the   
 farmers came to the school and asked  
 for childrento help.Mrs Townley went  
 on the train to Altcar to do this.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
