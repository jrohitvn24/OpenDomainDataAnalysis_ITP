 We visited  Mrs. Boaitt who lives at  
 The Old School House in Tibberton. As 
 the name suggests the house used to be
 the village school, but the school has
 now moved to a new building in the    
 centre of the village. The policy of  
 village primary schools is that if the
 number of children attending drops    
 below about 16, then the school is in 
 danger of closing with little         
 liklihood of it re-opening.           
 Mrs. Boaitt, her husband and their 3  
 children have lived here for 7 years. 
 They used to live in Gloucester but   
 moved because they liked the house and
 they wanted to live in the country.   
 The house itself is 136 years old,    
 detached and built of brick under a   
 slate roof. The house has solid fuel  
 central heating and to cut down on    
 heat loss the roof is insulated.      </content>
