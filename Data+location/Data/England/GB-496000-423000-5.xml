		<content>  Of the people surveyed many said that
 they sometimes attended a place of    
 worship.Fewer people said they never  
 attended and even less said they often
 attended a place of worship.The       
 majority of those who stated their    
 denomination were Anglicans,who at    
 sometime or other attended All Saints'
 Church.The next in number were        
 Methodists,who also worshipped in the 
 local Methodist Church.There were some
 members of both denominations who     
 worshipped elsewhere.As there is no   
 local Roman Catholic Church,all       
 members attended a church elsewhere.  
 Other Christian denominations         
 represented in the village are the    
 Salvation Army,Society of Friends,    
 Independent and Interdenominational   
 Christians,no other Christian         
 denomination appeared,nor did evidence
 of non-Christian religions.           </content>
