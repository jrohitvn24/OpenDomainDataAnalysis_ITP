		<content>   Because of Portsmouth's size and its
 position as a port, the city has a    
 high crime rate.To cope with this, the
 main police station at{Kingston       
{Crescent}has over 70 police constables
 and several fast patrol cars.Its      
 mascot is a dummy motorcyclist,'Speedy
 Gonzales',PC 999.{Kingston Prison}is  
 unique in the country for taking only 
 life sentence prisoners, and has not  
 had an escape for 30 years!           
   Of 9 homicides reported in 1984,only
 2 led to convictions, but all burglary
 (22% of total crime) was claimed to be
 detected, although less than a third  
 of the stolen property was recovered. 
 Nearly a quarter of crime was motoring
 offences ; sexual crimes amounted to  
 less than 1%.Of over 29,000 crimes    
 detected,nearly 8,000 were committed  
 by those under the age of 17.
