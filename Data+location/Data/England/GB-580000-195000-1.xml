		<content> SOUTH WOODHAM FERRERS NEW TOWN        
 THE TOWN WAS DESIGNATED A NEW GROWTH  
 AREA BY ESSEX COUNTY COUNCIL IN THE   
 LATE 1970'S.                          
 THE POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO REACH   
 18,000 PEOPLE. MANY FAMILIES ARE NEW  
 TO THE AREA WHICH HAS A FAST HOUSING  
 GROWTH. THE TOWN CENTRE REFLECTS      
 TRADITIONAL VILLAGE ARCHITECTURE AND  
 ILLUSTRATES DIVERSE USAGE OF NATURAL  
 BUILDING MATERIALS.                   
                                       
 THE RIVER CROUCH IS A MAIN SOURCE OF  
 RECREATION AND SEPARATES HULLBRIDGE   
 VILLAGE AND SOUTH WOODHAM FERRERS. IN 
 THE PAST SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE FERRIED 
 OR WALKED ACROSS THE RIVER TO         
 HULLBRIDGE WHICH HAD THE ONLY SCHOOL  
 IN THAT AREA.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
