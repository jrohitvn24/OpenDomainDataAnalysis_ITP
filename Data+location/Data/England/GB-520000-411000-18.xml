		<title>18Recreation in Stallingboro'</title>
		<content> Most houses have their own garden     
 where families grow some of their     
 vegetables, and a small proportion    
 have greenhouses, growing tomatoes and
 salads. One form of recreation enjoyed
 by all ages is the walk through the   
 meadows to the church.The village has 
 its own playing field of about five   
 acres. Small children are catered for 
 with slides and swings and there is an
 extensive adventure playground, most  
 of the eqipment being made of large   
 wooden poles. There is a football     
 pitch, practice goal posts and a      
 cricket area with a synthetic wicket. 
 Less active recreation is catered for 
 in the village hall where playgroup   
 and various organisations meet        
 regularly. The hall has a wooden block
 dance floor.
