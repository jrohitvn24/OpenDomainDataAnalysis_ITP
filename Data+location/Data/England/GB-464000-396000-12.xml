		<content>        One third of the clubs members 
 who answered our questionaire thought 
 the{fees}were reasonable while the    
 rest thought them{too high.}Only one  
 third of the golfers said that the    
 facilities were  alright,others did   
 not think much of them.Amongst the    
 things that people wanted to{change}or
 add were the{course layout}and        
 overwhelmingly came the plea for      
{better changing rooms.}A few members  
 said that they were distracted by the 
 R.A.F. planes but on the whole most   
 didn't mind them.The most popular time
 for playing was early in the morning. 
 The average time for one round is     
 about 4 hours but this varies.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
