		<content>{Penshurst Place}is one of Britain's   
 outstanding stately homes. It is      
 privately owned by Viscount De L'Isle 
 whose family are the 18th successive  
 Sidney family to make their home here.
   The Great Baron's Hall is part of   
 the original Medieval Manor. The      
 architecture also shows examples of   
 Gothic and Elizabethan styles.        
   This English Country House boasts   
 some very famous residents including  
 Henry VIII and Sir Philip Sidney.     
   The house was given to the Sidney   
 family by Edward VI in 1552, and      
 contains fine collections of early    
 portraits and tapestries as well as   
 many pieces of beautifully preserved  
 furniture.                            
   Surrounding the house are lovely    
 gardens, green avenues of tall trees  
 and acres of farmland.
