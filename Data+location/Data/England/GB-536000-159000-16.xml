Every day I get up, wash and clean my  
teeth,ready for breakfast which is     
normally cereal and toast. Then I      
brush my hair,get my coat and          
shoes,pick up my lunch box by which    
time my friend  Lucy is ringing the    
doorbell. At school we change our      
shoes and take our lunch boxes to the  
trolley. After our early morning work  
our class splits into groups,doing     
maths,writing,science,art  or cooking. 
After a short play I go down to        
lunch,where Lucy and I give out lunch  
boxes. After lunch and another short   
play we come in and read from          
1.30-2.00. Then we work from           
2.00-3.30. When school is finished     
Lucy and I play with one another. When 
I go inside I often watch television   
until 9.00 or read then have a bath    
before going to bed.                   </content>
