		<title>15The Gravel Pit</title>
		<content>   Our group made a visit to the gravel
 pit off Dymchurch Road. This is how   
 the gravel is processed. First the    
 gravel is dug out and put in barges,  
 which take the gravel to the first    
 washing machine to rinse. The gravel  
 is then taken up a conveyor belt to be
 washed thoroughly. The gravel then    
 goes up another conveyor belt to the  
 screen house where the gravel is      
 sorted into different sizes. These    
 sizes are under 5mm, 5_10mm, 10_20mm  
 and 20_40mm.                          
                                       
   There are approximately 80_90       
 thousand tons of gravel dug in a year.
 Most of the gravel is used for cement 
 but a small proportion is used for    
 roadworks. When the gravel has been   
 processed it is taken away in lorries 
 to a radius of 15 miles.
