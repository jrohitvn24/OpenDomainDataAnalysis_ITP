		<title>10NEW ROADS AROUND IPSWICH</title>
		<content> The opening of the Orwell Bridge in   
the early 1980's has allowed Ipswich   
to re-think it's problem of coping with
heavy traffic.                         
 The bridge allows traffic to by-pass  
Ipswich, it's adjacent roads are dual  
carraigeway with frequent parking      
lay-bys. The surface is tarmacadam and 
 The road has the necessary safety     
 easures such as protective lorries.   
 The roads are designed to have gentle 
gradients and the sides have been      
carefully landscaped and fenced.       
 A mid-week,mid-morning traffic count  
shows:                                 
  700 vehicles per hour towards        
Felixstowe                             
 550 vehicles per hour towards Ipswich.
Increased traffic is exspected when    
other roads are constructed to link up 
with the by-pass.
