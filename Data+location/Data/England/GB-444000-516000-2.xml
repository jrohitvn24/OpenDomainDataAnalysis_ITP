 The level of unemployment in Cleveland
 is the highest in Britain,except for  
 parts of Northern Ireland.{Thornaby}  
 has a very high level of unemployment 
 because some large firms have closed  
 down or reduced the number of workers 
 they employ. One of the biggest firms 
 in the area was{Head Wrightsons}and it
 is now closed. Many people in{Thornaby
 who worked for{British Steel}or the{  
{Imperial Chemical Industries}have lost
 their jobs.It is very difficult for   
 young people to get a job when they   
 leave school.Some of them are trained 
 for a year on the {Youth Training     
{Scheme,}but when the training finishes
 many of them become unemployed. Some  
 people think that young people cause  
 vandalism and behave badly because    
 they haven't a job to keep them busy, 
 and they are short of money.          </content>
