		<title>03HOUSING AT EASTFIELD</title>
		<content> Most of the houses on the Eastfield   
 estate are made of brick and are      
 usually semi_detached or terraced with
 front and rear gardens. In between the
 houses are open grass areas with the  
 occasional tree. The council built the
 estate originally and owned all the   
 houses but now some tenants are       
 deciding to buy their own house from  
 the council. A typical house has two, 
 three or four bedrooms, a living room,
 kitchen, toilet and bathroom. A large 
 number of houses are heated by gas and
 the others use coal, coke or          
 electricity. Houses do not have       
 garages adjacent or attached to them  
 but there are blocks of garages spaced
 around the estate. Most houses have   
 telephones and televisions.
