		<content>{Wivelsfield}is predominantly an area  
 of farmland with some woodland and    
 three small population centres.       
                                       
 It is fairly flat with an East/West   
 ridge, the underlying cretaceous rocks
 are of the mesozoic age and the soil  
 mostly Wealden clay. Two brooks wind  
 through roughly East to West.         
                                       
 As the prevailing winds are from the  
 SSW, the area is sheltered by the     
 South Downs and enjoys an equitable   
 climate.                              
                                       
 One main road, the B2112 ,runs through
 the centre linking the market town    
 of Haywards Heath with the historic   
 village of Ditchling. The London to   
 Brighton railway line passes from     
 North to South providing a vital      
 commuter route.                       </content>
