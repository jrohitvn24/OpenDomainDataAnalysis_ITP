 The Ditchling Players regularly       
 perform two plays a year in the excel_
 lently equipped Village Hall and      
 assist with a traditional pageant put 
 on every 10 years. The standard of    
 acting and production generally is    
 acknowledged to be very high and can  
 be attributed in part to the interest 
 taken by professionals connected with 
 the Village, notably the Sinden family
 and Dame Vera Lynne (the Forces'      
 Sweetheart). Recent productions have  
 included "The Crucible" by Arthur     
 Miller and "Ten Times Table" by Alan  
 Ayckbourn.                            
 The Ditchling Choral Society has a    
 membership of over 100. Janet Canetty_
 Clarke is their Director of Music and 
 Conductor and in l986 they plan to    
 perform Walton's "Belshazzar's Feast" 
 and Haydn's "Creation".               </content>
