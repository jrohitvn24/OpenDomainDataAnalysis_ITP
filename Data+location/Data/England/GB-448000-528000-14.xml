		<content>   The industrial estate in this area  
 has a good location because it is on  
 the{B1277}quite near the{A689}Stockton
 Road,which leads onto the{A19.}It is  
 also near the main coastal railway.   
   The industrial estate deals in      
 different products for example        
 Camerons deal in soft drinks which    
 are sold in shops.This is a light     
 industry.There is also a steelworks   
 which is heavy industry and service   
 industry in the form of a demolition  
 industry.                             
   This industrial estate is fairly    
 modern and it is made more attractive 
 by planting trees in grass over waste 
 areas.There is lots of waste land for 
 expanding factories and to make larger
 car parks.All of the factory buildings
 are constructed of concrete and       
 corrugated iron and have flat roofs.
