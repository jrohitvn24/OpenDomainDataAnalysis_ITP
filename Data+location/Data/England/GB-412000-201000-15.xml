		<title>15MISS JUNE LEWIS, AUTHORESS.</title>
		<content>  {Miss Lewis}is a well-known writer on
 Cotswold subjects as well as being the
 school secretary and instructor in    
 Commercial Subjects at Farmor's       
 School, Fairford.    She is also a    
{Cotswold Warden.}  Her books have     
 included subjects as diverse as typing
  manuals, books on rural crafts,      
 Cotswold villages, a novel 'The       
 Witches Mark', and various local      
 history and local recipe books.   Her 
 delight in the area stems from its    
 beautiful stone-built architecture and
 eventful history.   In line with this 
 she keeps three sheep  of the rare    
 Cotswold breed.    Miss Lewis has     
 lived all her life in the area and she
 was, as a schoolgirl, headgirl at     
 Farmor's school.   She lives in a     
 bungalow near the cricket field in    
 Park Street, Fairford.   The Cotswold 
 Way is the subject of her next book.  </content>
