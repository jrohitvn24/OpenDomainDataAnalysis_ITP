		<content> A survey of sixteen year old boys and 
 girls revealed the following about    
 todays music:                         
 Girls:-All my friends like the        
 following groups;Wham,Madonna,and     
 Ah-Ah because they are young people   
 who wear bright trendy clothes that we
 would all like to be able to wear.    
 There music is good and very easy to  
 listen to and you can hear the words  
 they are singing which is a change    
 from some of the groups that are on   
 the radio and television today.       
 Boys:-A lot of the boys in my year    
 prefer to listen to 'Heavy Metal'     
 groups such as Status Quo,AC/DC and   
 Real Life. They play their music very 
 fast and loud which makes it much more
 exciting  than other groups. However  
 the words of their songs are not as   
 important as the music itself.
