		<content> The area consists of undulating       
 countryside, mostly occupied by mixed 
 farms rising over 90 metres in the    
 N.W. to a ridge with gravel workings  
 and pine plantations. This is the site
 of Mortimer. The village has a lively 
 community. It has basic shops, primary
 schooling, primary health care,       
 churches, and a wide range of         
 voluntary communal activities. The    
 village is dominated by red brick.    
 Most of the buildings are of the last 
 100 years; Victorian around the centre
 and along the main roads, with later  
 developments around the edges. The    
 population continues to increase but  
 development has been restricted to in-
 filling to preserve the rural         
 environment. Traces of earlier        
 occupation exist, notably remains of  
 the Roman settlement of Silchester in 
 the S.W. corner.                      </content>
