		<title>05LANHYDROCK HOUSE</title>
		<content> Much of the house remains as it was   
 when it was occupied by the family.   
 The rooms range from the dining-room, 
 laid for dinner with priceless silver 
 and porcelain, to the servants'       
 quarters where the bedrooms are small 
 and strictly utilitarian.  Visitors   
 are allowed to see most of the house  
 either as members of the National     
 Trust, having paid a subscription, or 
 as visitors, having paid an entry fee.
 The outstanding room is the original, 
 seventeenth century gallery with its  
 plaster barrel ceiling which portrays 
 incidents from Old Testament history. 
 It is here that {Entertainment}takes  
 place in the winter months, such as   
 concerts, plays, social events. Behind
 the house is the church which is now  
 one of a group under the care of the  
 parish of Lostwithiel.
