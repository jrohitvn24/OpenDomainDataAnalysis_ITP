		<content> Prior to 1971 there was a resident    
 policeman at Middle Rasen who lived in
 the police house on the corner of the 
 new Gallamore Lane. After 1971 the    
 policeman still lived in the house but
 was based at the police station in    
 Market Rasen. He was responsible for  
 the parishes of Middle Rasen,         
 Spridlington, Faldingworth, West      
 Rasen, Toft Newton, Friesthorpe,      
 Linwood, Buslingthorpe and Legsby.    
 This area was patrolled on a motor    
 cycle. In 1971 this was replaced by a 
 van which was also manned by the      
 Tealby and Osgodby Officers. When     
 these beats were closed down in 1972  
 the whole area was covered by Officers
 from Market Rasen.
