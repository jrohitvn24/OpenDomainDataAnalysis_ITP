		<content> This computer bank has a distinctive  
 architectural appearance.In some ways 
 it resembles the superstructure of a  
 ship.It has the appearance of having  
 two 'decks' and has air vents which   
 resemble those used on ships.         
                                       
 The bank does not handle 'real' money 
 but computer transactions from all    
 over the world.Security is very tight 
 and only people with special passes   
 are allowed in.One hundred and eighty 
 people work there.The bank uses large 
 Main Frame computers.There are diesel 
 generators which come in if the       
 electricity supply fails.There is also
 a nuclear shelter to protect computer 
 records and personel.
