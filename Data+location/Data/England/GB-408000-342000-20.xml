		<title>20Changing pattern in our area</title>
		<content>Even though our area is a quiet,rural  
place,we noticed trends that seem to be
countrywide.It's harder for people to  
get jobs,especially the young and most 
people have more leisure time.Young    
peope tend to stay on at school for    
longer or have to be satisfied with any
job.                                   
 Lots of new people,mainly older       
generation are moving into the cottages
as they come up for sale and spending  
lots of money on doing them up.        
 There doesn't seem to be such a sense 
of "The community" as there used to be.
People are more mobile and look further
afield for their leisure activities.   
 More people work away from the village
too,so Ellastone is becoming more of a 
cmmuter village,than a self sufficient 
community.It will be interesting to    
note the continued changes.
