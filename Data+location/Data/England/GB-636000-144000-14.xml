		<title>14CLERK TO THE PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>   I am clerk to the Parish Council of 
 St. Margarets which meets on the      
 second Monday of every month. There   
 are nine Councillors who are elected  
 by Parishioners over 18 years of age. 
 Each member of the Council serves for 
 four years. I am the only one employed
 by the Council, and you could best    
 describe my role as that of Secretary 
   I deal with all clerical aspects of 
 the parish: people wanting Planning   
 Permission are always ringing up to   
 enquire constantly. I have to sign    
 cheques,make notes of complaints to be
 brought up at future committee        
 meetings. I also hold the titles and  
 deeds owned by the council.           
   When we meet in the old school, the 
 public are allowed to attend and they 
 have the freedom to question the      
 council. All in all I find it very    
 interesting being the Parish Clerk.   </content>
