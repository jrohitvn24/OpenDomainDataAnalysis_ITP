		<content> Few children in the area receive pre -
 school education but playgroup        
 facilities are available at           
 Hatherleigh and Okehampton.For Primary
 School education the area is divided  
 between Hatherleigh and Exbourne. The 
 larger school is in the nearby market 
 town and the small village school of  
 3O pupils is in Exbourne.No transport 
 is provided to take children to school
 which means that parents have to take 
 and fetch them morning and evening.   
 Secondary education is catered for at 
 Okehampton.(A couple of children go to
 private schools).A bus is provided to 
 take the secondary children to school 
 as it is 5 miles away.                
     In the days before the ubiquitous 
 motor car most country children had   
 long walks to school.
