   The School opened in 1973. Our      
 buildings are arranged in 3 main      
 blocks : they are modern, purpose     
 built and very well maintained.       
                                       
   The facilities of the school are    
 excellent, ranging from the heated    
 Indoor Pool and large Sports Hall to  
 a superb Library equipped with modern 
 Information Technology facilities.    
                                       
   The School has modern equipment in  
 many areas e.g. video, computing,     
 sciences, business studies, sports,   
 music, drama and many more.
