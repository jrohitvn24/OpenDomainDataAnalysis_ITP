 Langenhoe marsh is a fresh-marsh      
 protected by a sea-wall from the high 
 spring-tides which once covered       
 it.Rain and snow have gradually       
 leached the salt out of the soil.It is
 important for hen-harriers,merlin and 
 short-eared owls in winter as well as 
 great numbers of seed-eating migrants.
 Adders and grass-snake colonies are   
 found sunning themselves along the    
 sea-walls in places.Numerous varieties
 of salt-marsh and grassland plants    
 grow here,providing food for many     
 threatened species of butterflies and 
 moths,such as the Essex Emerald moth. 
 Rare dragonflies and damsels abound   
 near the brackish pools,as well as    
 some uncommon bush-crickets.This area 
 acts as a home for many small mammals,
 such as voles,shrews and harvest      
 mice,as well as foxes.                </content>
