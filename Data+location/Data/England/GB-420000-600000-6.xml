		<title>06Trees &amp; Woods of Acklington</title>
		<content> There are many trees in Acklington    
 Village.  One of the oldest and most  
 impressive is the large Chestnut on   
 the east edge of the village, it is   
 thought to be about 300 years old.    
                                       
{Station Wood}is the largest wood in   
 our area. It is owned by the Duke of  
 Northumberland and is approximately 38
 hectares in area. A team of woodmen   
 look after the wood and plant new     
 trees. The oldest trees in the wood   
 are 79 years old and the youngest ones
 planted are only 3 years old. Trees in
 the wood include Scots Pine, Norway   
 Spruce and Douglas Fir, as well as    
 Oak, Beech, Sycamore, Willow, Birch,  
 Ash and Holly. The wood used to be    
 part of a Deer Park and indeed there  
 are still a few Roe Deer living and   
 roaming in the wood. There is a public
 footpath running through the wood.    </content>
