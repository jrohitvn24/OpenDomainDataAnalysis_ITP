 The thatched Hailey Farm Cottage is a 
 feature of{HOUSING}in the area. It is 
 the oldest farm cottage in Herts.,    
 formerly owned by Mr.Bob Munser for   
 many years. Hailey Lane has 26 houses 
 (6 semi-detached), Hertford Road 20   
 houses, Chardingleve Farm 4 houses,   
 Gypsy Lane 37 houses and Springle Lane
 10 houses. Springle Ho. in Springle   
 Lane was formerly a manor. It was sold
 6 months ago (to the Simms family)    
 because the residents were too elderly
 to cope with such a large house and   
 moved to Aldeny. 'The Finches' (also  
 in Springle Lane) has the only 'ingle-
 nook' fireplace left in Herts. and    
 tarred weatherboarding. It is just    
 outside the boundary of the Hoddesdon 
 'conduits{water}system'.
