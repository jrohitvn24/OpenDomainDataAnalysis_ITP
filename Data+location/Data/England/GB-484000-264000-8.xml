		<title>08 A Wedding in Wilby Church</title>
		<content> The bridegroom &amp; the best man wait at 
the front of the church for the bride &amp;
her attendants to arrive. The tradition
is that the groom should not see the   
bride on the wedding day and that he   
should not turn round &amp; see her as she 
walks down the aisle. When she meets   
the groom at the end of the church they
stand in front of the priest who asks  
the congregation whether anyone knows  
of any reason why they should not get  
married.This is a very tense moment in 
case anyone speaks out and stops the   
wedding.The couple then make their     
marriage vows, hymns are sung and the  
blessing given. The register is signed.
 The couple walk outside the church    
where people throw paper confetti &amp;    
give the bride lucky silver horseshoes.
Photographs are taken and everyone goes
off to eat and drink.
