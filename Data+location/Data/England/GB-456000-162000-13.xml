		<title>13RECREATION IN TADLEY</title>
		<content> For those who do want to go out and   
 "do something" the Hurst Community    
 School and affiliated clubs provide   
 facilities for: archery, art, ATC,    
 badminton, bowls, basketball, choir,  
 climbing, debating, football, guitar, 
 gymnastics, hockey, judo, netball,    
 photography, skittles, squash,        
 swimming, table tennis, tennis and    
 wado karate. There is also a full     
 range of evening classes. Everyone    
 from six to sixty-six is catered for. 
 Teenagers can go in for the Duke of   
 Edinburgh's Award Scheme or attend one
 of the three different Youth Clubs. In
 spite of all this there are still     
 constant complaints from some young   
 people that there is nothing to do    
 around Tadley. The Sports Centre which
 many people demanded is being built at
 the Calleva Industrial Park.
