<title>21How Shanklin has changed in 25 years!</title>
<content>I remember writing this article when I was a young lad of 7 years old at Shanklin C of E Primary School.  It seems that I was not so far off the mark at describing Shanklin in just 25 years time, let alone a hundred!  Indeed we have a large supermarket which sells pretty much everything you would need to buy, cliff erosion continues to be a problem, there are certainly many more computers at the school and, yes, the school secretary definitely uses a computer with a printer rather than her old typewriter!&lt;br />&lt;br />I remember the Domesday Disc computer being used at our school to view the project and how space-age it seemed with its LaserDisc technology and trackerball.  The Education Authority had one machine for the entire Island which was loaned to the school for one week and then the information was never to be seen again for years to come.&lt;br />&lt;br />How wonderful to have all this work uncovered for all to see again.&lt;br />
