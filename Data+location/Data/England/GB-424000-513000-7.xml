		<title>07WEST CEMETERY IN DARLINGTON</title>
		<content> West Cemetery covers 62 acres of land 
 and it opened in 1857. In the Cemetery
 in 1972 a Roman tomb was discovered   
 but unfortunately from which date is  
 unknown.                              
 The Book of Remembrance is opened     
 daily showing the names of people who 
 died on each date. In the Cemetery    
 Charles Dickens' brother was buried in
 1868. Quite a few well-known people   
 are buried there like the famous Pease
 family.                               
 There is a block where Jewish people  
 are buried showing David's star.      
 In 1942 most people died because of   
 the second world war.                 
 There are different kinds of          
 headstones some with pictures on like 
 horses and cars, depending on the work
 of the deceased person. West Cemetery 
 can be visited from Carmel Road North.
