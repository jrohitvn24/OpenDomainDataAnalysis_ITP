		<title>17Farming  - The  Butley Area</title>
		<content>Farming in this area has changed over  
the last twenty five years. Irrigation,
improved land drainage ,scientific and 
technological developments have meant  
that the land can be used for more     
arable farming. At last, farmers have  
stopped taking out hedges and are      
planting trees and shelter belts which 
are helping in conservation of both    
wildife and soil.                      
There are three main types of soil in  
the area, sand, clay and loam. The sand
is used for crops like barley, green   
beans and rye. In periods of drought   
this type of soil has to be well       
irrigated. The clay, on the other hand,
is much too wet and must be drained    
well before it can be used. Wheat is   
grown here. Loam, a mixture of clay and
sand, is good for growing most crops.  
There is very little livestock in this 
area.                                  </content>
