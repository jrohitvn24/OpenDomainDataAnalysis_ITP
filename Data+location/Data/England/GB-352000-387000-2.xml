		<title>02LOCAL ATTITUDES.</title>
		<content> The local people wanted to get rid of 
 the factories and Chemical Works and  
 to introduce more countryside into    
 their town . The men wanted more work 
 and the women more entertainment .    
 Warrington was the favorite shopping  
 centre because it had a large variety 
 of shops that were easy to reach .    
 The locals were happy living in the   
 area but not with the amenities around
 them . Three of the locals complained 
 about the bad smells coming from the  
 LA PORTE Chemical Works and the poor  
 traffic conditions along Moorfield    
 Road .Barrows Green is a tidy area    
 surrounded by fields and hedgerows ,  
 the people are friendly and easy going
 but two of the people we interviewed  
 got quite angry when complaining about
 the poor facilities for the young .
