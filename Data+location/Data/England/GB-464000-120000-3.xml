		<content> All aspects of the trade of blacksmith
 except shoeing is carried out         
 including repair and maintenance of   
 agricultural and horticultural        
 machinery.Many types of welding and   
 brazing,carpentry and property        
 repairs.The main activity is the      
 construction of steel gates,railings, 
 firebaskets and fire accessories to   
 order,but any metalwork to customer's 
 requirement is undertaken.One of the  
 original two forge hearths is still in
 use virtually daily for the heat      
 treatment of tools such as            
 chisels,axes etc. after sharpening,   
 although hand bellows have been       
 replaced with an electrically driven  
 air blower.Wrought iron is rarely used
 having been replaced by mild steel    
 although there is still a requirement 
 to refurbish old wrought and cast iron
 gates and railings.                   </content>
