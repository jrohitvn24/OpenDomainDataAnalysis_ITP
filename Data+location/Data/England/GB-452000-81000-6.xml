 The oldest houses in Godshill are the 
 15th and 16th Century thatched        
 cottages around Church Hill. The      
 village next began to grow along the  
 main Ventnor-Newport Road where the   
 pretty cottages now form the basis of 
 the tourist industry as gift shops,   
 tea rooms etc. From 1960 Godshill grew
 at a great rate, when several estates 
 were built, mainly to house young     
 families, but some for old people. To 
 provide housing at as cheap a rate as 
 possible, the houses on one estate    
 were built as shells, the fittings    
 being left to the purchaser to        
 provide. A second large estate of     
 about 70 houses was built for private 
 sale, but were taken over by the local
 authority when few sold. They are now 
 mainly occupied by Council tenants, a 
 small number still privately owned.   </content>
