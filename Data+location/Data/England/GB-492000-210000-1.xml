		<content>    One of Britain's oldest routes,the 
 Icknield way runs from East Anglia to 
 Stonehenge on Salibury Plain,closely  
 following the chalk ridge near Tring. 
    Also the Roman road,Akeman Street  
 cuts through the  Chiltern Hills      
 through the Bulbourne Valley.Where    
 these ancient roads cross,you find    
 Tring.                                
     Tring is a small market town in   
 the western corner of Hertfordshire.  
 The history of the town can be traced 
  back to Saxon times.                 
    The name changed over the centuries
 from Treunge,Trehanger to Tring.The   
 name is supposed to mean"Trees hanging
 on the hillside"It was a natural place
 for a settlement,and it remained a    
 village until the 19th century when   
 the railway and canal opened up the   
 possibility of trade with more distant
 places.                               </content>
