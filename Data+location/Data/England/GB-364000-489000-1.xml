		<title>01SEDBERGH GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>      The market town of Sedbergh lies 
 just inside the Yorkshire Dales       
 National Park in the county of        
 Cumbria.  To the north are the Howgill
 Fells with Winder Fell dominating the 
 town.  Sedbergh is at the meeting     
 point of the A684 (Kendal/Hawes) and  
 the A683 (Kirkby Lonsdale/Kirkby      
 Stephen) roads with the C5101 to Dent 
 to the south-east.  Sedbergh is known 
 to many for its boys' public school.  
      Sedbergh is a very important     
 centre, providing all the main        
 services for the surrounding          
 rural area which consists of the      
 village of Dent, several hamlets and  
 many outlying hill-farms. The town is 
 becoming of increasing interest to the
 tourist and holiday-home owner because
 of its proximity to the Dales and the 
 Lake District, the M6 motorway being  
 only five miles away.                 </content>
