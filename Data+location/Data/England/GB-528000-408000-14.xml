		<title>14CLEETHORPES PIER</title>
		<content> In August 1985, Cleethorpes pier      
 appears to have a new lease of life.  
 Built by a group of local businessmen 
 and the Manchester,Sheffield and      
 Lincolnshire Railway Company, the pier
 opened on August Bank Holiday 1873.   
 Despite a fire in 1903, and a hole    
 blown in it to thwart a possible      
 German invasion in 1940, the pier     
 remained an important centre for      
 entertainment until recent loss making
 years. The Cleethorpes Council, which 
 had bought the pier in 1935,sold it to
 a private company in 1981.However, it 
 failed to make a profit and was       
 closed.Several attempts were made to  
 sell the pier and finally it was sold 
 to a London based company. Since the  
 sale the pier has been extensively    
 renovated with bars, dance floors,a   
 restaurant and games room.Hopefully   
 the pier will regain its popularity.  </content>
