		<content>     This area is largely residential; 
 some properties dating back to the end
 of the 19th Century but the majority  
 having been built during the inter-war
 years by the council or, in some      
 cases, by housing associations.       
     The principle shopping area for   
 this district is at Portswood but     
 there are small parades of shops in   
 Burgess Rd. &amp; Swaythling High Road.   
 The latter contain food stores, post  
 offices, hairdressers and a           
 laundrette. The main problem in using 
 these parades of shops is that they do
 not have parking facilities and so    
 congestion is a constant problem.     
     This area is not well served with 
 recreational facilities and what does 
 exist is often uncared for and subject
 to vandalism.
