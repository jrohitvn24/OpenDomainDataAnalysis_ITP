 At the front of the school there is   
 one large window facing to the south. 
 We are in the biggest room of the     
 school. There are four rooms in the   
 building a canteen, a library, a hall 
 and a classroom. The infants, which is
 the smallest class,are in a           
 prefabricated classroom.The hall is   
 for religious assembly,P.E.,music,T.V.
 craft,drama, etc. The library has all 
 kinds of books. There are science     
 fiction,reading books and many        
 reference books.                      
                                       
 Although the school was founded before
 1754,the present school building was  
 erected in 1892.In the old days the   
 boys had one end of the playground and
 the girls had the other end.There is a
 climbing frame at one end and at the  
 other end there is a P.E. shed.       </content>
