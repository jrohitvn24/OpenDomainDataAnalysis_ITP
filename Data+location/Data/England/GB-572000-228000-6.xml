		<title>06Shalford Village Hall</title>
		<content>     {Shalford Village Hall}was built  
 in 1925 by order of{Major Guy Gold}of 
{Abbot's Hall, Shalford,}with the      
 condition that, if it was not required
 as a hall, it could be converted into 
 two bungalows. There was 4.5 acres of 
 land included.                        
      In 1945 the hall and playing     
 field  were presented to the people of
 the village under the control of a    
 committee of eleven.{Major Gold}also  
 donated Â£1,500 for an extension when  
 needed , but part of this money was   
 eventually used to erect a clock tower
 on the hall in memory of{Captain      
{Rodney Gold}who was killed in the     
{Second World War.}The balance of the  
 money contributed to an extension,    
 built in 1970, which included a       
 smaller hall and modern cioakrooms and
 showers.
