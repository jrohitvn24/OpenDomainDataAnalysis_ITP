		<title>10HOME LIFE IN THE BERROW AREA</title>
		<content>     Home life is stable, perhaps old  
 fashioned. Young Worcestershire       
 children take school transport or walk
 to Castlemorton: Gloucestershire      
 children to Redmarley. At 11 they     
 attend Comprehensive school at Upton  
 or Newent. The main meal is often in  
 the evening.{Vegetables and eggs}are  
 produced and bought locally.{Village  
{shops}are widely used: nearby towns   
 provide for all needs. Bread, milk and
 newspapers are delivered. There are   
 travelling shops and library. Bottled 
 gas is widely used as there is no     
 mains gas: all houses have electric-  
 ity. Mains water is common but some   
 wells are used. There is some main    
 drainage but most premises rely on    
 individual septic tanks. Most families
 have a car and bicycle.{Dogs}and{cats 
 are common, also{goats}and sometimes  
 a{pony.                               </content>
