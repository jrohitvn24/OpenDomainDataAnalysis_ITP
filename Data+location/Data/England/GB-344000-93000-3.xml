		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> I woke up on the 3rd June 1985 at     
 seven o'clock.  I got dressed and went
 downstairs.  My mum was making the    
 sandwiches.  I went outside and went  
 down to the barn.  I had to take my   
 pony to his field.  When I had put his
 halter on I led him down the road.    
 Grandad was in the farmyard.          
                                       
 When Kasmik was in his field I walked 
 back home.  When I got inside, I went 
 upstairs and changed into my summer   
 dress.  I went downstairs and had a   
 wash.  My brother, Scott, was still in
 bed so I had to wake him up.          
                                       
 When he had dressed we both had       
 breakfast.  It was{cornflakes}with a  
 lot of sugar on.
