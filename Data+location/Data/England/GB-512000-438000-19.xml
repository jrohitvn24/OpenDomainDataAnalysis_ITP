		<content> In Skirlaugh on Mondays and Wednesdays
 lots of girls meet either in the      
 village hall or the school for        
 brownies.Brownies  play games and sing
 songs.                                
 After Monday brownies guides          
 starts.This is very much like brownies
 but it is for older girls about the   
 age of ten.In guides they do a bit    
 of writing and not so many games as   
 brownies do .                         
 On friday night there is              
 a youth club.To join you have to be   
 over ten there's a snooker            
 table,darts,table tennis and a disco  
 room.Next to the antique shop there is
 a small building which is called the  
 reading room,but it's used for        
 snooker.There is a junior snooker club
 and a club for people over sixteen.{
