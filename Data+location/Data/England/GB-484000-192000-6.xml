		<title>06THE OCTOGON SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content>  The main{Octogon Shopping Centre}was 
 built in 1967 and covers 35 acres. It 
 cost over 4 million pounds and        
 consists of 70 shops, a{central bus   
{station, the Newland multi-storey car 
{park, a pedestrian precinct}and       
{offices.}From Oxford Street to Bull   
 Lane, the shops are held up by pillars
 and  shoppers are protected from the  
 rain by overhead canopies. There are  
 two storeys of shops under a domed    
 roof. Part of{Murray's store}was      
 knocked down early in 1985 and new    
 smaller shops were built. The other   
 part of Murray's has been boarded up  
 and has a sign up for it to be rented.
{Sainsbury's}is being moved to a larger
 site in Frogmore. The old shopping    
 centre around the High Street now     
 consists mainly of{estate agents}and  
{offices.
