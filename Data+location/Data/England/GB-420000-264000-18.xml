		<title>18How I spend my spare time</title>
		<content>{ # 1} I usually help my Dad or Mum.  I
 chop some logs for the fire and help  
 Dad to put up some pens for our       
 chickens.  I set some mouse traps to  
 kill them because they eat our chicken
 food in the shed.  My Dad gives me 5p 
 for each mouse I catch.  When the     
 chicken shed is dirty I clean it out. 
                                       
{# 2  }In my spare time I either go and
 play in the island over the road or   
 watch television most of the time.    
 Sometimes I get a book out and trace  
 pictures and colour them in with felt 
 tip pens or I use my sister's poster  
 paints.  Or I read my school reading  
 book - my favourite books which I have
 read are Little Grey Men, Anne Frank  
 and Charlotte's Web.
