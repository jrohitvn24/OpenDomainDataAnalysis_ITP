		<title>14NOTTINGHAM - THE CORNER SHOP</title>
		<content>  There are two corner shops near where
 I live.The people who own the shops   
 are kind and generous.If you try to   
 compare a corner shop with a          
 supermarket, you'll find that a       
 supermarket is miles bigger.When I go 
 in the shop, I hear them talking in an
 Indian language which I don't         
 understand, so I can't listen in on   
 their conversations.Of course,there's 
 always the other corner shop to listen
 in on.One of the shops smells of all  
 sorts of things.                      
  I go to the corner shop for milk,    
 teabags and things like that, but I   
 especially go there for sweets.I      
 just love sweets.I can't part with    
 them.I have to have them every minute 
 of the day.Some of the most perculiar 
 people go into the shops.All they want
 to buy is drink.                      
                                       </content>
