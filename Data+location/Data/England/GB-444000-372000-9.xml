		<title>09Stanfree School Closure.</title>
		<content>   When I went to school at Stanfree   
 there were only 21 children there.    
 The school only had 2 classes.  One   
 day in 1979 there was going to be a   
 play at the school.  I was going to be
 Mary.  The play started but when I saw
 my mum I dropped baby Jesus and I ran 
 to her. I liked it at Stanfree.       
  {Stanfree school had to close in July
{1984}because there were only 11       
 children and{it cost too much to pay  
{for}the central heating, dinner       
 ladies, cleaners, caretaker, welfare  
 assistant, clerk and 2 teachers.      
   I think it's a shame that the school
 had to close because when I was there 
 I used to play with my friends at the 
 back of the school on the grass.  I   
 used to play with balls quite a lot,  
 I like skipping as well.
