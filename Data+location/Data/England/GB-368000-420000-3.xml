		<title>03Family Life in Darwen</title>
		<content> This survey has been taken from a     
 small section of the community in     
 Darwen.The average family consists of 
 2 to 3 children with an age gap of    
 about 2 years.The main forms of family
 recreation include watching T.V.and   
 day outings to the countryside. There 
 is little movement of families between
 towns,the majority having lived here  
 for twenty plus years.This must be due
 to close proximity of relatives       
 together with their long term         
 attachment to the area.Those that have
 recently moved here have taken        
 advantage of the cheaper housing &amp;    
 education in schools.The majority of  
 couples both work &amp; are mainly        
 employed in local industry.The more   
 qualified jobs are filled by families 
 recently moved to the area.The        
 families surveyed thought Darwen was a
 good place to bring up a family.      </content>
