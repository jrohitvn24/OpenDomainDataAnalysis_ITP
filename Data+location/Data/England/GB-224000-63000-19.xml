		<title>19Stuart House,Liskeard</title>
		<content>  This Grade II listed building in the 
 centre of the Conservation Area is    
 thought to date from the early part of
 the 16th century and to be the work of
 Sir H.Trecarrel, the architect        
 of Launceston Church(1511-24).During  
 the time of the Civil War,it was owned
 by the local commissioner,Mr.W.Jean.  
 King Charles stayed there for 6 nights
 in August 1644 when in pursuit of the 
 Earl of Essex and his parliament      
 forces who had crossed into Cornwall  
 the previous month. Following the     
 defeat of Essex's army in a series    
 of skirmishes around Lostwithiel,     
 Charles once more crossed the Tamar,  
 staying with Mr.W.Jean in Liskeard    
 (Sept.4th)en route.The present name of
 Stuart House refers to this royal     
 connection. It is hoped to fully      
 restore the house as an Arts and      
 Heritage Centre for the region.       </content>
