		<title>19Weather in Emborough</title>
		<content> The climate of the Emborough area is  
 somewhat colder than the surrounding  
 countryside because of its altitude.  
 This is noticeable particularly in    
 early Spring whe there is a           
 retardation of some two  to three     
 weeks in the start of growth and      
 blossoming.  Precipitation during the 
 winter months falls as snow on many   
 more occasions and this tends to lie  
 for longer periods.  There is a high  
 incidence of hill fog occuring with   
 south westerly winds, bringing low    
 cloud and drizzle from the Bristol    
 Channel.  Showers and thunderstors    
 which develop in polar maritime       
 airstreams at all times of the year,  
 are less intense of prolonged because 
 they appear to e delected to the SE or
 NW of the area, by the Mendip plateau.
