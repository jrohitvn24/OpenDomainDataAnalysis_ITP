		<title>10A WALK ROUND BRADLEY</title>
		<content>   Just a little distance from the     
{Pinfold},a triangle of grass there    
 is a small brick barn with slates, not
 tiles on the roof in an irregular     
 pattern.                              
   The first farm you come to is{'Brook
{Farm'}and is owned by Mr.Lawton.He    
 owns a plane which he uses for        
 pleasure.                             
   The banks become high and sandy as  
 the narrow roads lead up to{Copestake 
{Farm}owned by the Greets.On either    
 side of the road the fields are mostly
 arable which contain grain.           
   In two crop fields there is a marshy
 hollow,shaped in a semi circle.It     
 looks as if it could have been a pond.
 One semi circle has gone dry and      
 willow trees grow there.In the other  
 one it is still damp and marsh plants 
 grow there including bullrushes.
