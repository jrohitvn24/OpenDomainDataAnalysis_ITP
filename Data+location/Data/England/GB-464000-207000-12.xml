 The school fete was a success but it  
 was a pity the weather did not hold   
 out until the end.There was country   
 dancing,a gymnastics display and many 
 other attractions and stalls including
 smash the crockery,tombola and white  
 elephant.The raffle prizes were 1st   
 prize a black and white portable      
 television, 2nd prize a personal      
                                       
                                       
 stereo                                
 cassete player and 3rd prize one girls
 watch and one boys watch as separate  
 prizes.Apart from the weather the fete
 was a great success.We raised almost  
 Â£300.
