		<title>06THINGS TO DO IN DIPTFORD</title>
		<content> Diptford has its own recreation{field.
 It was constructed in 1977 to coincide
 with the Queens Silver Jubilee. A     
 Trust gave the money and there is a   
 Village Committee who run it and      
 decide about the amenities.  They have
 provided climbing apparatus, a tennis 
 court and an open space for any ball  
 games.  People of all ages use these  
 facilities. A lot of people ride and  
 own horses and go to gymkhanas. Most  
 people have {hobbies} and are         
 returning to the old crafts of        
 spinning, weaving and knitting sheeps 
 wool. Some pursue them out of the     
 village at local {sport}and craft     
 centres. Many people have around their
 homes attractive gardens and spend    
 much time visiting garden centres to  
 buy seeds and plants.
