		<title>15MALVERN GAZETTE</title>
		<content> On 17/6/85 3 pupils from Malven Link  
 Junior School intervewed the editor of
 the local paper which started in 1855.
 She edits two papers,The Malvern      
 Gazette and The Ledbury Reporter,     
 contained in one leaflet.Most articles
 of the paper are on local events some 
 articles are for children.She recieves
 15-20 letters per week on articles    
 that are written in the paper.To      
 finace the paper advertisement is as  
 essential as the price the public pays
 for the paper.We asked if it was      
 unusual to have a female editor but   
 she told us that if you can do the job
 it does not matter.She employs 16     
 staff.The newspaper is printed        
 approximately 8 miles away from where 
 it is actually written.
