		<content>{OWEN OWEN                             
   The only departmental store in      
 Stourbridge is OWEN OWEN. It was      
 founded by a man caled Owen Owen in   
 Liverpool in 1868.                    
   The Stourbridge branch, originally  
 owned by 'Stringers', has a mortuary  
 in the basement and a cinema upstairs,
 which both are still intact today.    
   In employment at the local branch   
 there are 62 staff and 6000           
 nationwide.There are 20 lease         
 concessions at the Stourbridge store. 
   The main office in Liverpool is the 
 centre for all the buying that is     
 done. To work in Owen Owen you do not 
 need any specific qualifications. To  
 solve theft they employ store         
 detectives and use close circuit      
 T.V.'s.
