{  }                                   
   On a busy weekend this is used by   
 130 people but during the week it is  
 usually 60 or 70 people a day.        
  This is a{public course}and people   
 pay to use it-Â£2.50 for an adult      
           Â£1.25 for O.A.P.or junior.  
    There is also a{club}that uses the 
 course and they charge Â£7.50 to join  
 and an annual subscription of Â£6.00   
 which entitles you to enter           
 competitions and gain an official     
 handicap but you still have to pay    
 green fees.                           
   To play golf you can use your own   
 clubs or hire them but you must have a
 pair of golf shoes.
