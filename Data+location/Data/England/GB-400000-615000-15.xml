		<title>15FAWDON FARM</title>
		<content> Another of the tiny farm steadings is 
 Fawdon.It is a hill farm located at   
 around 500' with hills around which   
 rise to around 1000'.Like similar     
 sized places in the area it consists  
 of a large farm house and workers     
 cottages.The farm is owned by the Duke
 of Northumberland and is managed by   
 the same family who manage Linhope    
 farms.The youngest son has now taken  
 over the running of the farm and now  
 lives in the farm house.There are     
 three terraced farm cottages          
 for workers though these  are now     
 empty with the sole labourer living   
 down the valley.The shepherd lives in 
 a new cottage.One house which belonged
 to the grand-parents of the present   
 tenant is privately owned.The farm is 
 both sheep and arable.
