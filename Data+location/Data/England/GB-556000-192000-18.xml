		<title>18ROTH.TWIN TOWN TO BRENTWOOD</title>
		<content>   In August 1978 Brentwood twinned    
 with the town of{Roth}in Bavaria,     
 West Germany. The first official visit
 to Roth took place in May 1979 when   
 members of The Town Planning          
 Association arranged for organisations
 and clubs to make exchanges with      
 families in Germany.                  
                                       
   A talented Youth Band from Roth came
 to perform in Brentwood on May 25th   
 1985. During this summer Scout and    
 Guide groups and the Athletic Club    
 will go to Roth. These and other      
 exchanges have fostered close links   
 between the two communities.          
                                       
   It has not affected everyone. In a  
 survey of 100 people only 42 knew     
 about the Town-twinning programme with
 Roth.
