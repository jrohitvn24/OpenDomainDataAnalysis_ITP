		<title>16THE DALES NATIONAL PARK</title>
		<content> The Yorkshire Dales National Park was 
 established in 1974. The National Park
 is neither nationally-owned, nor a    
 'park' in the usual sense of the      
 word. Its aim is to conserve the      
 beauty of the area and at the same    
 time to provide opportunities for     
 everyone to enjoy it. This is achieved
 by imposing strict planning           
 regulations on all building and       
 development and providing an advisory 
 service on land use and ecology to all
 who live in, work in or visit the     
 area. One of the two main             
 administrative offices is alongside   
 the Ure at Yorebridge with a staff of 
 22 and one warden covering            
 Wensleydale.                          
 The sign of the Dales National Park is
 a Swaledale ram's head.
