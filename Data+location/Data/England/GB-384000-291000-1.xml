		<title>01A General View of Wombourne</title>
		<content>Six miles to the south of Wolverhampton
in attractive  open countryside are the
villages of Wombourne,Himley &amp; Smestow.
Himley &amp; Smestow are ribbon settlements
with  few houses. Wombourne, with about
15000 villagers, is the central feature
of this area.It has its origins in Pre-
Norman  times with its name coming from
two Anglo-Saxon words  meaning "winding
stream".                               
   Wombourne is centred  on  a  village
green,now a sports ground,surrounded by
local shops,the ancient church, library
and  civic  and  community  centres. In
recent   years  there  have  been  many
housing developments, both council  and
private, as well as  the  provision  of
several small industrial estates.      
   The  land is undulating  with  Orton
Ridge  to  the  north  of  the  village
offering the only real high ground.Most
of the surrounding area is farmland.   </content>
