		<title>15BUS SERVICES IN MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>    Buses are the only form of public  
 transport in the Mitcheldean area. The
 main operator is the National Welsh   
 Omnibus Service, who run the Red and  
 White services. Mitcheldean is        
 fortunate in also having its own      
 company, Cottrells Coaches who run    
 other local bus services, as well as  
 coaches for hire. The Red and White   
 services which pass through           
 Mitcheldean are the Gloucester -      
 Cinderford - Lydney service, and the  
 Ross - Cinderford service. Both       
 operate at 2 hourly intervals on      
 weekdays. Cottrells principal service 
 is the Gloucester - Mitcheldean -     
 Drybrook - Ruardean route, on which   
 they use double deck buses. By running
 at times when there is no Red and     
 White service to Gloucester, their    
 service is a popular one. Cottrells   
 also run buses for Dene Magna School. </content>
