		<title>03A Wigan Walking Day</title>
		<content>On Sunday 2nd June St. Mark's Church   
had their annual walking day. We all   
had to meet at l.30 p.m. We had our    
walking day clothes on which had been  
made specially for the occasion.       
At 2.00 p.m. the procession moved off. 
In the procession were people involved 
with St. Marks Church as well as two   
brass bands who played as we walked. We
walked round the parish and back to    
church where a short service was held. 
On the 16th and 17th June, St. Williams
Church in Ince had a Walking Day.  Two 
other churches also took part, Belle   
Green Methodist and Ince Parish Church.
St. Williams is a Catholic church and  
used to have a Walking Day of its own  
until it was abandoned about twenty    
years ago.  This year will be the first
time that the three different churches 
have got together for a Walking Day.
