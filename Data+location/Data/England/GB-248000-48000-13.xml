		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF TRISTAN</title>
		<content>{(By Tristan Watts aged 10)}Last Satur-
 day morning I woke and switched on the
 TV until breakfast. When I had finish-
 ed breakfast Mum and my sister went   
 into town. A bit later I went up to   
 the shop to buy a{Father's Day card   
 for{Dad,}and some{wrapping paper.}When
 I got home I had to creep past Dad who
 was painting the garage. He said{"Why 
{are you making a crackling noise?"}I  
 answered that I had bought a new pen  
 for school! I went in and wrapped my  
 present for Dad, and I had to hide it 
 somewhere.{Mum}came home and we had   
 lunch.{My sister Verity}had a{ballet  
{exam}on that day too,so after lunch we
 went to the Village Hall. There we dr-
 opped off Verity and Mum,and Dad and I
 went to the{Cub Sports}at the Elize   
 Hele School. I was in three races.    
 Overall we came third.That evening Mum
 and Dad had a{dinner party}at home.   </content>
