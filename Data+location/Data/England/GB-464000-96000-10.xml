		<content>    The Royal Marines' Barracks was    
 built in 1864 and used to house the   
 Royal Marines Artillery. At one time  
 there were over 1000men. Streets near 
 the barracks have names linked with   
 the Marines such as Lumsden Road and  
 Halliday Crescent which are named     
 after Marines awarded the V.C.        
    Now the barracks is nearly empty,  
 apart from the {Royal Marines Museum  
 and 200 Marines including the 100     
 bandsmen that provide the band for the
 Royal Yacht. There is also a cadet    
 corps.                                
    The award winning {Royal Marines'  
{Museum} has a large collection of     
 medals, uniforms, personal letters    
 and belongings of such famous people  
 as Nelson.The barracks,apart from the 
 museum are to be sold but as some of  
 the buildings are heavily listed they 
 cannot be pulled down.                </content>
