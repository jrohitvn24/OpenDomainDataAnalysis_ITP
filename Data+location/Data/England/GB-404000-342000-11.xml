		<title>11CHANGE IN ALTON</title>
		<content>Alton was once a quiet little village. 
If a stranger walked into Alton now at 
about 9:30am or 6:00pm,he would see a  
High Street full of coaches,buses and  
cars and the only sounds he would hear 
are constant purr of engines and the   
frequent peep of horns.But if he walked
into Alton at 2:00pm he would see a    
totally different High Street,free of  
the bustle of traffic travelling to    
Alton Towers.                          
  Alton has changed in other ways.New  
private housing estates and a Village  
Hall have been added to the old part   
of the village,with its Â£Lock-up' or   
Round House,built in the 19th Century  
as a makeshift prison,and other        
interesting old buildings.  Many of    
the pubs do "Bed and Breakfast" as do  
other places such as the Malthouse,    
Dale Farm and Â£Holiday Homes in        
Alverton'.                             </content>
