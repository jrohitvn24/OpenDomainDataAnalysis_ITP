		<title>20...DONNA'S DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>I woke up at 7.30a.m., got up, had a   
wash, dressed and went down for my     
breakfast. I had toast and a cup of    
tea.I then cleaned my teeth and brushed
my hair. I watched 'The Young Ones' on 
the video before I left for school at  
8.40a.m. The morning session began with
registration after which we went to the
hall for assembly. Our first lesson of 
the day was Maths. Play-time followed, 
after which we had Creative English in 
which we wrote stories about a storm at
sea. The bell rang at 12.00 noon and I 
went home for my lunch. I went back to 
school at 12.45p.m. I played with my   
friends until the whistle was blown at 
1.00p.m. We had games in the afternoon.
The boys played football and the girls 
did netball. School finished at 3.30pm.
When I got home I listened to some     
records in my bedroom. After tea I read
&amp; watched TV. I went to bed at 9.45pm. </content>
