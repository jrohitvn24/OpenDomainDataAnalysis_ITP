		<title>07The Viking Way</title>
		<content> The Spa trail takes up most of the    
 Viking Way in our area. It runs by the
 Horncastle canal that is no longer    
 used but has ducks and is used for    
 fishing. The walk can be done in about
 20 minutes, but it is worth taking    
 your time to see the pretty views and 
 the wild life. By Thornton Lodge we   
 saw cattle that we learned were       
 Charolais from France and Chianina    
 from Italy crossed with Ludlow Reds.  
 These give very good beef. They grow  
 clover on the farm for cattle feed and
 we found a lot had gone on the path   
 and it was a good place to lucky four 
 leafed ones. Some parts of the walk   
 are very wide with plenty of space.   
 Other parts were closed in by bushes  
 and trees and we could imagine the    
 original Viking traders trudging along
 the land.                             
                                       </content>
