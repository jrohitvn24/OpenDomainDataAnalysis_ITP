		<title>19MENDIP-RECENT CHANGES</title>
		<content>    Farming has changed greatly in     
 recent years.Mechanisation has led to 
 fewer but larger farms, some farms    
 becoming abandoned as a result. New   
 pesticides &amp; fungicides mean that many
 crops now survive the mildew problems 
 caused by the high rainfall of the    
 plateau. Support buying policies of   
 the EEC's Common Agricultural Policy  
 have changed cereal farming on Mendip.
 Good prices have led to more peas and 
 oil seed rape. The traditional sheep  
 farming pattern of the plateau is now 
 becoming rare, although many sheep    
 are still sold at the annual Priddy   
 Fair.                                 
    Tourism, recreation &amp; wild life    
 conservation in nature reserves are   
 all becoming important aspects of     
 Mendip land use &amp; have reduced the    
 emphasis on agriculture.
