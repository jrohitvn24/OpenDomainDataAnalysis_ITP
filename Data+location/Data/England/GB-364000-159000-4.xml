		<content> Eleven people took part in our survey.
 Five out of the eleven visited ponds  
 in the area. These people had managed 
 to catch a glimps of certain kinds of 
 wildlife such as tadpoles, fish etc.  
 The most common place people saw      
 waterlilies was Emborough Pond. Some  
 of the people thought that the public 
 on the whole kept the ponds clean and 
 did not throw their rubbish into them.
 Some of the people had seen dead water
 life, mostly fish. This might be due  
 to pollution of the water although the
 source of the pollution is not known. 
 Most people thought that waterlife    
 should be protected to ensure that the
 balance of nature is maintained.      
 Although no one took an active part in
 any conservation group,they  said they
 would take action if they saw anyone  
 deliberately harming waterlife.
