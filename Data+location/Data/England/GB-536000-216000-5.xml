		<content> The village of High Cross stands on   
 the A.10 London to Cambridge road. It 
 is a linear settlement where two small
 lanes make a crossroads with the A.10.
 The village shop is also the post     
 office and sells a great variety of   
 goods. Near the shop is the village   
 hall,where many activities are        
 organised (eg. there was an evening   
 class on clog dancing in June). On the
 A.10 is "The White Horse" pub,which   
 has attractive,white weather-boarding.
 There are 2 petrol stations in the    
 village,which serve the busy A.10. The
 only industries are a horse-box makers
 who started in 1957 and employ 42     
 people,a woodcraft firm who also frame
 pictures and a small yard which sells 
 paving slabs. The housing is of mixed 
 age. Along the A.10 there are pretty  
 C18th terraced cottages,but the rest  
 are modern semis and detached houses. </content>
