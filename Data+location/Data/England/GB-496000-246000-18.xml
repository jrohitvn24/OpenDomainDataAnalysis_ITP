		<content> A caravan selling refreshments has    
 become a common feature along the main
 roads.On e such is in the lay-by at   
 Ducksworth.They are mobile,have no    
 planning permission (and would be     
 unlikely to receive it) are not       
 connected to services and therefore   
 pay no rates.They are required in     
 North Bedfordshire to register with   
 the health authorities,who inspect    
 them and their home base where food is
 prepared and have to conform to       
 hygiene regulations.e.g.they must have
 a hot and pumped-up water supply for  
 washing,and display a name outside.   
 They are popular with lorry drivers on
 long hauls whose large lorries cannot 
 be catered for in urban areas.Their   
 main problem is ensuring they meet    
 standards and litter in surrounding   
 fields and ditches.
