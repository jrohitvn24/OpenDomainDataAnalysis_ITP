		<title>07SAVE OUR SWIMMING POOL!</title>
		<content> The swimming pool was built in the    
 early 1960's by parents.The{P.T.A.}   
 have always paid for the upkeep and   
 heating. In 1983 the pool was painted 
 but it soon flaked and it wasn't used.
 In October 1984 the A.G.M. decided to 
 keep the pool open and had to raise   
 Â£6,000 in five months. The            
 fund_raising schemes were as follows:_
 1.{50/50 AUCTION}that raised Â£550;    
 2.{A MUSICAL_"HOW THE WEST WAS ONE" } 
 that totalled Â£1640;                  
 3.{BMX FREESTYLE EVENT}(stunt bikes)  
 raised Â£450;                          
 4.{SPONSORED WALK}raised Â£1200;       
 5.{SPONSORED SLIM}(the Head decided to
 lose weight and was sponsored for     
 every pound lost) and raised Â£700.    
 6.{DONATIONS}totalled Â£1100.          
 The pool was opened in June 1985, much
 to the relief of staff, parents and   
 pupils....by Jeffrey Cole.            </content>
