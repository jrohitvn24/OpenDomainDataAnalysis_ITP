		<title>19PARK VIEW THURCASTON</title>
		<content> On Anstey Lane, Thurcaston, are the   
 stables of Mr. and Mrs. McDonald. The 
 stables hold as many as 90 horses and 
 ponies, some of which belong to local 
 people. My family keeps our horses    
 there.                                
    There are 6 fields and paddocks, an
 indoor arena, outdoor menage and 'The 
 County Saddlery' which is a shop that 
 sells anything you might need for a   
 horse.                                
    A 1 hour riding lesson will cost   
 Â£3.50 for juniors or Â£4 for seniors   
 and a Cross Country Lesson will cost  
 between Â£5 and Â£10.                   
    The facilities are used by many    
 people, on the day we visited a group 
 of physically handicapped children    
 were there. Each week a group of 7-11 
 year olds from Highcliffe Primary     
 School ride as part of their Outdoor  
 Pursuits program.                     </content>
