		<content>    I live in Rushenden. You can play  
 football in the playing field. It's   
 like Queenborough playing field.      
 They've got some good hiding places.  
 It's brilliant for playing            
{Hide-and-Seek}and{40-40}and{Manhunt   
 and{He.                               
    40-40 is a game like Hide-and-Seek.
 Somebody counts up to 50 and the      
 others go and hide. There's a post    
 called Cat's Post, and after the      
 person has counted he goes to look for
 the others. If he ses one of them he's
 got to run to the Cat's Post and say  
 '40-40 shot you'. Then that person is 
 He for the next game. But if a person 
 can get to Cat's Post and say '40-40  
 shot myself' then he isn't He.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
