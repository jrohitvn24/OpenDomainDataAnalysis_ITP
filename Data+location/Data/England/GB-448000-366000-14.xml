		<content>  Oil Seed Rape is found growing in    
 fields all around Stony Houghton.From 
 a distance the fields look yellow.The 
 oil from this crop is used as machine 
 oil,and some is used in margarine.    
  The trees around Stony Houghton      
 suffer from Dutch Elm disease.Some    
 trees are very badly affected.Some    
 have holes in the bark.A quarter of   
 the trees had leaves but others were  
 without.It was sad to see this disease
 killing thousands of trees in the     
 area.
