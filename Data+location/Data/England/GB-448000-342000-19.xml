		<content>   Here are some of the unusual things 
 that we do in our spare time.         
   In my spare time I go to{antique    
{fairs}with my mum and dad. We go in   
 our car. When you go in you have to   
 pay about 30p. Inside there are rows  
 of stalls. On the stalls there are old
 bowls, poys and sometimes stamps. You 
 can walk around the stalls. my parents
 collect Toby jugs. Here are the names 
 of some of the jugs. Old Charley,     
 Robin, The Three Musketeers.          
              -------                  
   On Sundays I go{B.M.X. racing.}I    
 race for a team called Bunny's G.T. We
 used to be the best shop team in      
 Britain. I race in the 8 year olds    
 group. Last week it was the British   
 Championships, at Derby. I made it    
 through my three heats, called moto's,
 and my semi-finals. In the final I    
 came fifth.                           </content>
