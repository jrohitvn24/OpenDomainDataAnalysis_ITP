		<title>05Cottesmore Then and Now</title>
		<content> Cottesmore was once called Cott's     
 Moor.On a Sunday people would go to   
 church and leave their meat, if they  
 had any,cooking in the bakehouse.The  
 local shop Stricklands is now where   
 the bakehouse used to be.The lane near
 Stricklands is called Clatterpot Lane 
 because the drinking water came from a
 pump in in the bakehouse yard,and when
 people put their buckets down they    
 made a big clatter.There were two     
 mills one in Mill Street,which was    
 then called Sheepdyke and another one 
 in Wenton Close.Mill Street was called
 Sheepdyke because of the ditch where  
 they dipped the sheep.They used to put
 disinfectant in it,then push the sheep
 through and out the other end.The     
 villagers used it free, outsiders were
 charged.It was filled in,in 1950.The  
 road to the camp was called Rogues'   
 Lane because of the gypsies' camp.    </content>
