		<title>07POST-WAR HOUSES IN BECKLEY</title>
		<content>In the High Street two pairs of Council
houses were built just after the War.  
These have now been purchased by their 
occupiers. Two sets of one or two bed- 
roomed bungalows have been built for   
older people, one of four dwellings in 
High Street and a more recent row  of  
five dwellings named Roman Way at the  
village end of the Woodperry Road. As  
Beckley is in the Oxford Green Belt    
most house building since the war has  
been permitted only between existing   
houses so that Woodperry Road now      
consists of a continuous row of        
dwellings, mostly detatched, on the    
N.W. side of the road. In the 1970s    
eleven houses were built in Beckley    
Court, formerly a stone quarry. Most of
the Beckley children at the village    
school live in Woodperry Road or       
Beckley Court.
