		<title>03LANDSCAPE OF NORTHWOLD</title>
		<content> Northwold is a conservation village   
 and this has had a major influence    
 on the current style of the village.It
 is a linear village.                  
 A large number of houses incorporate  
 chalk and flint walls - the chalk     
 coming from the pits which used to be 
 at the west end of the village.       
 Houses dating back to the mid 16th    
 century nestle amongst later          
 buildings.Very few houses have escaped
 being extended and modernised over the
 years.All external improvements to    
 older properties should retain the    
 character of the village.             
 Many premises like bakeries,public    
 houses and shops have been converted  
 into domestic residences.             
 A very old stone pillar is situated   
 near the center of the village.Its    
 origins are unknown.There is also a   
 memorial cross near the church.       </content>
