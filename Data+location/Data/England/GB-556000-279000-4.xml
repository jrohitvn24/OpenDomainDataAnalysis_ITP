		<title>04DRAINAGE-RIVER OUSE (i)</title>
		<content> Our four by three kilometre area is   
 covered by the Middle Fen Drainage    
 Board.It has six main drainage        
 channels.The water from these has to  
 be pumped up into the River Lark.This 
 is because the peat soil shrinks as it
 dries out and so the River is embanked
 above the surrounding farmland to     
 prevent flooding.From the River Lark  
 the water flows into the River Ouse   
 and reaches the sea at Kings Lynn.In  
 1829 the banks of the River Ouse were 
 straightened for six miles from Ely to
 Littleport and this part is called    
 Sandys Cut.Most water is pumped from  
 the farmland in winter.The main       
 pumping station is at Prickwillow and 
 has two diesel and two electric pumps.
 The electric pumps run at night       
 because the electricity is cheaper.
