		<title>09BORROWASH QUESTIONNAIRE</title>
		<content>  In a recent survey of parents and    
 visitors carried out by pupils of     
{ASHBROOK JUNIOR SCHOOL}the following  
 facts emerged: 84% of the people      
 interviewed liked living in {BORROWASH
 with its friendliness being the most  
 frequently quoted reason.The only     
 consistent grievance concerned the    
 lack of leisure facilities in the     
 immediate area particularly for young 
 children and teenagers.Our amenities  
 count seemed to highlight this        
 inadequacy.The village shopping       
 facilities were generally considered  
 adequate although the most popular    
 facilities were those in {NOTTINGHAM} 
 with those of {DERBY}a poor second.The
 amount of time families had lived in {
{BORROWASH}ranged from 2 to 60 years,  
 the average period was 15.7years.69%  
  travelled mainly by car,train travel 
 scored badly as no local station.     </content>
