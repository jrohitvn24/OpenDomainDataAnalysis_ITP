		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE-MICHELLE</title>
		<content> On a Saturday I get up at about seven 
 o'clock and have breakfast.After      
 breakfast I go to the swimming pool on
 my bicycle.Usually I practice floating
 and diving.The swimming pool is really
 good.After swimming I go home for     
 lunch and after that I go to ballet.  
 There are four classes between ten    
 a.m. and two p.m.After ballet I go    
 swimming again.For tea I have a hot   
 meal and after that I watch           
 television.At half past seven I go    
 upstairs,wash,clean my teeth get      
 changed and read.At half past eight I 
 say my prayers and go to sleep.I think
 that Woodhall Spa is a great place to 
 live if you like activity clubs.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
