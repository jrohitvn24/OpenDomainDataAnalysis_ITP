		<title>05HOUSING - a converted farm.</title>
		<content>   My name is Tracey and my house is   
 called 'Well House Farm'. It has been 
 converted from a small farm house.    
                                       
   Upstairs there are seven rooms plus 
 one airing cupboard.  Downstairs there
 are ten rooms with a hall as well. The
 stairs have fourteen steps which are  
 covered in a green carpet. There is an
 arch under my sister's bedroom and the
 house is made of old bricks.          
                                       
   There are outer buildings which     
 consist of a garage, two stables and a
 boiler house. We have a swimming pool 
 which is about seven feet deep and    
 also a tennis court. There are three  
 fields in which we keep a donkey, pony
 and sheep and where the dog and kitten
 play. We have a large garden that has 
 flowers, evergreen trees and          
 vegetables together with an orchard.  </content>
