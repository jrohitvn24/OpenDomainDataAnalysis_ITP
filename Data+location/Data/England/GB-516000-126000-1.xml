 The local{bus}company is{Southdown}.A 
 Southdown bus is quite reliable unlike
 some other bus companys I could       
 mention.The buses start at{Brighton   
 and end up in{Horsham.}The journey    
 takes 1 hour 24 minutes.By that time  
 they have stopped 22 times.The bus    
 from Brighton to Horsham only stops   
 twice outside our school at 8.05 AM   
 and at 9.35 AM.We asked 23 people in  
 our class how many{cars}their         
 family had.Two people had got one car,
 fifteen had two cars,four people had  
 three, one person had four and one    
 person had six.As you can see most of 
 the people had two cars.I was         
 surprised that not many people had one
 car.Most people in our class had      
 either one or two{bicycles}one person 
 has four and another has five, I was  
 not surprised.                        </content>
