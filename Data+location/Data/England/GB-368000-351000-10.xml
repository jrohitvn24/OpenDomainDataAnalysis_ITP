		<content> We have seven hairdressing salons in  
 our area, after a visit to two        
 local salons Alexander James, Wells   
 Green and Madame Klaras, Kings Drive  
 Wistaston we drew conclusions.We      
 found that women over fifty years of  
 age made the bulk of the              
 customers, treatments varied from     
 cuts, blow-dries, perms to shampoos   
 and sets, at least seventy-five       
 percent wanted perms.The "bob" used to
 be very popular but now fifteen-twenty
 year olds preferred their hair styles 
 to reflect their pop idols and their  
 clothing and make-up mirrored         
 this.Although brightly coloured hair  
 in the punk styles is still           
 fashionable young people think about  
 their jobs and compromise with more   
 subtle hair colouring.                
 It takes four years of hard work, long
 hours and patience to become qualified</content>
