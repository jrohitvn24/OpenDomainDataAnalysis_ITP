		<title>18Houses in our area.</title>
		<content> We conducted a local survey by sending
 questionnaires to each household in   
 the Stiperstones and Snailbeach area. 
 We discovered these statistics about  
 types of houses in the area.{22%}are  
 semi-detached{34%}are detached houses 
{28%}are detached bungalows{16%}are    
 extensively rebuilt cottages.There are
 so many detached properties because   
 the area has developed slowly since   
 the mining days, with only in-filling 
 taking place occasionally.We have also
 discovered that{48%}of the houses are 
 brick- built,{34%}are stone-built,{11%
 are stone and brick-built and{7%}are  
 timber.{58%}of the houses  were built 
 during this century.But{42%}are more  
 than{80}years old.An interesting point
 is that{45%}are built all or partly of
 local stone. This suggests that local 
 stone was readily available and       
 probably free.                        </content>
