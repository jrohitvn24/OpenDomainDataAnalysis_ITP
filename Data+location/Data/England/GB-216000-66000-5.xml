		<content> The monkey grip is very popular.One   
 person is it. He tries to catch other 
 people who when they are touched form 
 a chain until all the children have   
 been touched.                         
 Stuck in the mud is when a person is  
 it and has to chase other people those
 he touches have to stand still with   
 their arms outstretched so that people
 can free you from the mud.If you are  
 caught three times you become it.     
 British bulldog is a game in which    
 children all have to cross the        
 playground avoiding the child that is 
 it.                                   
 You need three or more people to play 
 budge one to catch people and the     
 others to stand in squares or         
 circles.When the catcher shouts budge 
 the others have to move to another    
 square or circle without getting      
 caught.                               </content>
