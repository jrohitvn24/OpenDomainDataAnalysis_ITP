		<title>03Dedham - The Flood Plain</title>
		<content>                                       
 Dedham is on a sort of step made by   
 flood waters which flood fields that  
 are below the level of the step.      
 The fields that get flooded are no    
 good for growing corn and so on       
 but are very good for grazing         
 cattle because the water makes the    
 ground rich so the grass grows well   
 for the cows.Sometimes the river wears
 away the bank, changing the shape of  
 the river.On the bank willows grow,   
 they are pollarded willows. When the  
 trees are young their branches are cut
 off and when the trees are older      
 instead of having branches which hang 
 down they have short spiky branches.  
 They are lopped off after about ten or
 fifteen years and used for fencing.
