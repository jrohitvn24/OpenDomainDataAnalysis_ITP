		<title>07WARREN FARM</title>
		<content>   The building of Warren Farm House   
 and the creation of a farm from part  
 of the Toddington Manor Estate dates  
 back about 100 years. The farm is now 
 privately owned. The house is being   
 substantially renovated including new 
 roof, damp course and double glazed   
 windows. The size of the accomodation 
 is being increased.                   
   The farm was originally a fruit farm
 with about 100 acres of orchards but  
 the trees were felled in 1979 because 
 they were old and unprofitable.       
   The land is now used for growing    
 wheat and for pasture.
