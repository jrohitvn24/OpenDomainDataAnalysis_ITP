		<content>{ Tektronix}is one of the industrial   
 factories in Pindar Road, Hoddesdon.  
 The site covers 6 acres. Tektronix was
 started by Howard Vollum in l952. It  
 was originally called Telequipment    
 before an American company took over  
 in 1967. 200 people are employed.     
 Tektronix is the sole U.K. maker of   
 oscilloscopes which are used for      
 accurate measuring of electricity.    
 This equipment costs from Â£1000       
 upwards per sets.                     
  Tektronix sell about 6000            
 oscilloscopes each year. The product  
 takes 5 days to make. The average     
 worker earns Â£85-Â£95 per week. The    
 factory is small compared to the one  
 in Beaverton, Oregon in America which 
 employs 20,000 workers. The site was  
 formally used to make concrete slabs.
