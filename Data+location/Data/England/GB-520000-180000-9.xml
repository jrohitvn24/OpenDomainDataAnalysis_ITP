		<content>The North Hammersmith and College Park 
area is quite rich in transport. It has
railway line to other parts of the     
country. This stops at Willesden       
Junction and Acton Central.It also has 
an underground train line(the central) 
which stops at East Acton, White City  
and Shepherds Bush, to take people into
the centre of London, and to the east  
part of London. Most of the bus routes 
go to the centre of London and         
Hammersmith. The roads are extremely   
busy and some are dangerous to cross.  
There is a large dual-carriageway road 
which runs from central London to      
outside London in the west suburbs.    
Many of the people work at the local   
railway depot at Willesden Junction,   
which is the starting point for trains 
travelling to Euston. The industry in  
the area surrounds the railway.
