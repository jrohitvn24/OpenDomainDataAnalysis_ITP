		<title>08MANOR HOUSE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> The{Manor House Hospital}was founded  
 in 1916 by the{Allies' Benevolent     
{Society}which was formed in 1914 to   
 provide field hospitals for the French
 Army. In 1916 the team returned home  
 to England where the government asked 
 them to build a hospital for{casual-  
{ties of industry.                     
 The hospital got its name because it  
 was built on the site of the{Golders  
{Green Manor.}The earliest parts of the
 buildings were huts and afterwards    
 became wards, but now they are used as
 stores.                               
 The members paid one old penny a week,
 now they pay fifty pence a week.      
 In the hospital they have a busy time 
 with{100 in-patients and 500 out-     
{patients}to look after and sometimes  
 some of them are difficult. In the    
 hospital there is{no Maternity Care.
