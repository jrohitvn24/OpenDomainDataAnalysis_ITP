		<content>   Our area is on the outskirts of the 
 town and includes nine small township 
 areas,{Ravensthorpe,Paston,Gunthorpe, 
{Dogsthorpe,New England,Walton,        
{Millfield, Westwood and Bretton.      
{ }It is mainly housing but industry is
 dotted around the outskirts of the    
 grid. The main North/South London to  
 Edinburgh railway crosses through the 
 middle of the  grid as does the main  
 A15 trunk route to Lincoln.           
   The{Development Corporation}have    
 built a ring road around Peterborough 
 and this passes East/West through our 
 grid. Through our area it follows the 
 route of an old railway.To allow this 
 to be built{Fulbridge Road}had to be  
 changed into a wide loop making a     
 complex roundabout.                   
 There are many schools as well as good
 facilities for other activities in the
 area.                                 </content>
