		<title>15ST. GEORGE'S CHURCH,ORLETON</title>
		<content> We interviewed the vicar and this is  
 what he told us about the church. The 
 original church was built in{Saxon    
 times and was made of wood, this      
 eventually fell down. The next church 
 on the site was a{Norman}one, some of 
 the features of the Norman Church can 
 still be seen. Todays{tower}is partly 
 Norman.The next church,a bigger one,  
 was built around the Norman church,   
 and most of the earlier one was       
 knocked down.The stonework for this   
 church was brought from{Orleton       
{quarries.}Most of todays{roof timbers 
 come from the old{Elizabethan         
{battleships.}The{font}is the original 
 Norman one, it is a very important one
 and is included in any book about     
 fonts.It has{nine raised figures      
 around the outside. Nobody knows why  
 there are nine figures.
