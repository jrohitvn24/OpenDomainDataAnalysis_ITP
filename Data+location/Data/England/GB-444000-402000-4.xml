		<content> I think that the most noticeable      
 feature in our area is the railway    
 lines, there are trains running every 
 ten or fifteen minutes, you can hear  
 trains sometimes in the night.  In the
 summer there are trains that go along 
 the lines with great big lights on the
 front, and they make a noise like     
 thunder.                              
 On our bit of grass at the back there 
 is always dog dirt.  On the front I   
 watch cats digging holes and then they
 do their dirt.  If you walk on the    
 grass you would have dog dirt on your 
 shoes.  Since we've been living here, 
 that's about two years now, we've had 
 about ten dead mice on our garden ....
 next door's cat keeps bringing them.  
 They have a dog but keep it in; many  
 people do not care and let them roam. 
 Now there is a van that comes round   
 and collects any stray dogs.          </content>
