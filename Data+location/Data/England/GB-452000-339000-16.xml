		<title>16SUTTON PASSEYS VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Before the Conquest, Sutton (South    
 Town) consisted of 2 manors held by   
 Saxons (Aluric &amp; Brun) and rated for  
{Danegeld}at 12 Bovates (about 180     
 acres). Sutton and Wollaton were      
 passed to the{Peverell}family at the  
 Conquest but already described as     
 'waste'. By the early 13th C. the land
 had passed to the{Passeys}family and  
 had become known as{Sutton Passeys.}  
 In 1339 the manor was transferred to {
{William de Willoughby,}Lord of the    
 manor of Wollaton. At the time of his 
 death in 1363 he owned a dwelling, a  
 dovecote, 40 acres of land, 4 acres of
 meadow and 6 shillings in rent. The   
 moors of Sutton, Wollaton and Lenton  
 were eventually enclosed to form      
{Wollaton Park}- the arable fields     
 became Lenton &amp; Radford. The remains  
 of the manor are now beneath the Ring 
 Road roundabout.   {Ellen Pudney}     </content>
