		<title>10Village Recreation</title>
		<content>     In our area we have found three   
 places of recreation which include one
 small private swimming pool and two   
 playing fields one with a football    
 pitch.But people want more recreation 
 like more tennis courts and badminton 
 courts and one person wanted a        
 swimming pool for young people.The    
 playing field with the football pitch 
 was old fasioned and a bit boring and 
 mostly field with a concrete play     
 ground with swings and slides on it   
 also with a car park and wooden hut.
