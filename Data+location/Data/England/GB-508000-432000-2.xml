 Most Women if they want to look       
 glamorous wear make-up daily, and get 
 their hair done monthly. The present  
 fashion is a straggly perm with wet   
 gel on to hold it in place and plastic
 butterfly clips. To go with this, they
 wear a suit of three quarter length   
 trousers with a baggy jacket and roll 
 up sleeves. The colour is a light     
 pastel that is suited best on cotton  
 material. To complete the outfit the  
 shoes are leather and flat heeled.    
 They also have a flower pattern cut   
 into the shoe. The necklaces are      
 coloured a pastel colour as well. To  
 match the suit we also have large     
 button shaped earings to match the    
 suit. If women wear tights they have  
 all different kinds of various        
 colours.They also have a bow at the   
 heel.                                 </content>
