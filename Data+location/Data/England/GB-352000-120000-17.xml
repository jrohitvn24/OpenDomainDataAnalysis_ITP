		<title>17Why my family need a car</title>
		<content>   I live in{Yeovilton village}where   
 there is{no public transport}service  
 so a{car}is really essential. My Dad  
 drives a{Volvo 240,}a fast car and    
 great to ride in. My Mum drives a     
{Morris 1100,}neither fast nor         
 comfortable!                          
   Without a car we could not go       
{shopping}in Yeovil, nor visit the     
{cinema}or{theatre}there nor could my  
 sister and I attend our{clubs}like    
 dancing and drama and swimming.And we 
 could certainly not go for{pleasure   
{trips}far afield into the countryside.
   Both my mother and father have to   
 have cars to drive to their places of 
{work}and my father also needs his car 
 to get to the various business        
{appointments}he has to keep and to    
 take us to the{dentist}or{doctor.     
   I'm looking forward to the day when 
 I have a car of my own!               </content>
