		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content> The land in this area of the survey is
 mainly agricultural. The farms are    
 mixed, with some livestock and some   
 acreage for grain crops. Some of the  
 farms are very large and include the  
 hillsides which are difficult to farm 
 and are often left as rough grazing.  
 There are a few small farms in the    
 area.                                 
                                       
 The main livestock are cattle, both   
 for milk and for beef, and sheep. Most
 fsrmers grow a variety of grain, some 
 for animal feed and some for human    
 consumption. Silage has become an     
 important animal feed and more        
 silaging than hay-making occurs.
