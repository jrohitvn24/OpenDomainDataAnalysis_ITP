		<title>15Nabbotts Schools Fayre</title>
		<content>  Two weeks ago,June 29th 1985,we had a
 school summer fayre.It started at     
 2p.m.There were two dancing           
 displays,maypole and country          
 dancing.There was a make-up stall.I   
 could feel the make-up pressing       
 against my face.My eyes were closed   
 and I had a yellow stripe and a green 
 stripe across my eyelids.My eyebrows  
 were pitch black and I had the same   
 colour spots down my nose and my      
 lips.I had a go on the tombola and on 
 the double your money stall.I watched 
 the best dressed teddy and the best   
 decorated bicycle.We went to the book 
 shop where new books were on          
 sale.There were photographs of        
 teachers when they were children.There
 was a raffle too.
