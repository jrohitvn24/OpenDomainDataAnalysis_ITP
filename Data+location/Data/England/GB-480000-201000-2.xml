		<content>The chalk comes to the surface over a  
large area around Buckingshire and     
there are a sizeable number of chalk   
pits around Risborough situated around 
whiteleaf cross.                       
There are three different types of     
chalk around here one has flints in,   
one is known as the "CHALK ROCK" and at
the foot of the hill is the lower chalk
which has a grey appearance. This lower
layer from a junction with the clay of 
the vale of Aylesbury and gives rise to
springs.
