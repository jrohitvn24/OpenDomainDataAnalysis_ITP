		<content> Mrs. Sutton told us how life was along
 time ago in Speke......               
    ...the children did the dusting and
 polishing when Stocktonwood School was
 first opened.Mrs.Sutton had classes in
 her own  living room before our school
 opened. All Saints church hall was the
 first school in the area.   Mrs.Sutton
 has lived in Speke for 49 years,she is
 now 82.    When new people moved  into
 Speke,  they lived in their half-built
 houses.  The Dunlop factory used to be
 Rootes  Securities  where bombers were
 built.   Our school might have been an
 hospital during  World  War  Two.  The
 classrooms  were going to be wards and
 the hall the operating theatre.   Army
 tanks used  to  train  on  the  fields
 where I live now!Speke was smaller and
 quieter in those good,old days!
