		<content> All the saltmarsh and intertidal area 
 are a part of the R.S.P.B. Morecambe  
 Bay Reserve. A new area, Allen Pool,  
 has recently been formed by the       
 R.S.P.B. to encourage waders to stay  
 and breed. This and the flooded       
 marshland attract many teal, shoveler,
 lapwing, redshank, and greylags. The  
 changing channels are encouraging more
 birds to roost, the old breakwater and
 rocky outcrop at Jenny Brown's Point  
 attracting turnstones.The wildfowl are
 now protected as the R.S.P.B. hold the
 shooting rights. Spring brings waders,
 Marsh Harrier, and Osprey.In winter   
 there are many migrants, for which    
 this is one of the most important     
 areas in Britain. There are a great   
 variety of butterflies and flora, some
 quite rare.The railway to the East    
 acts as a barrier to flooding of the  
 landward farmland.                    </content>
