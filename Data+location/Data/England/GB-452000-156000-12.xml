		<title>12RACING STABLES, KINGSCLERE</title>
		<content>{ Park House Stables}were built in     
 1885. The present trainer is Mr. Ian  
 Balding. There are a hundred          
{racehorses}and hunters to be looked   
 after. There are four yards, of       
 different ages, and in one of them is 
 a statue of Mill Reef who was trained 
 here in the 1970's; he was a Derby    
 winner, and his descendants are still 
 being trained at Park House.          
  Horses are bred at the stables, and  
 they begin their training when they   
 are between 16 and 18 months old.Their
 names are given by their owners, and  
 some have very strange names.         
  The horses are taken out each day,   
 often to the gallops on top of the    
 downs. Sometimes they use a swimming  
 pool which is 14 feet deep. After     
 going swimming they go on an exerciser
 to help cool them.  Sixty-five people 
 work at the stables.                  </content>
