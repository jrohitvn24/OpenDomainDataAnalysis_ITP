		<title>19A DAY IN A LIFE TIME</title>
		<content>My name is Zenka Geary.I am 9 years old
and I will be 10 this year.My favourite
work in school is English and swimming.
At home in the evening I change my     
clothes into my shorts and go and call 
for Samantha Adams and we play on our  
bikes.Sometimes I like maths and       
sometimes I dont.I like going on       
outings at school because they're more 
exciting.I like snuggling in my bed    
because its nice and warm.I like       
watching television especially Superman
On Mondays after school I go to        
gymnastics.I like listening to pop     
music.I like getting presents for my   
birthday and for Christmas.I like      
reading a lot because I think books    
are exciting.         Sept 1985
