		<title>04ANNUAL FETE AND DOG SHOW</title>
		<content>The Fete and Dog Show at the Civic Hall
is an annual event organised by the    
Didcot Girl Guides.  There is a big    
raffle at the end and in 1985 the first
prize was 50 pounds.  Each Guide pack  
distributes a prize.  The Fete consists
of various stalls, both games and      
sales, most of them organized by local 
Guide packs.  The Dog Show is judged in
different categories: for example dog  
most like its owner, best behaved dog  
and best child handler.  There are 12  
classes of dog breed altogether, each  
class being made up of different       
breeds.  The Dog Show opens at 1.00 and
finishes at 4.00.  The Fete starts at  
the same time as the Dog Show and      
finishes at 4.30.
