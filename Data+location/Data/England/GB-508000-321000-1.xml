		<content> The Southern area includes recent     
 housing estate developments in bourne,
 however aprat from this concentration 
 the block is sparely populated.  the  
 small villages of dyke, cawthorpe and 
 the south part of Morton are the only 
 populated areas  agriculture and      
 forestry are the two main industrial  
 activites.  Bourne Wood extends along 
 the west side of the block; this is   
 owned by the forestry commission and  
 is the eastward limit of the wooded   
 and hilly land of south west          
 Lincolnshire.  Dyke itself sits on the
 edge of dyke fen which is about 6 feet
 above sea level.  The land is rich and
 provides high grade farming.  dyke has
 not een subject to development and    
 remains a single street village with  
 little new housing.
