		<title>10SENIOR CITIZEN'S DAY</title>
		<content> A typical senior citizen (pensioner)  
 gets up at around 8.00. Many          
 pensioners have dogs and often go for 
 a walk with their dogs after          
 breakfast.                            
                                       
 Relaxation, in the form of an         
 afternoon sleep, usually takes place  
 after lunch. Many watch TV, or read   
 books.                                
                                       
 Some of the men and women play bowls  
 on the local bowling green, others go 
 to the Mexborough Arms public house.  
                                       
 Most have lived in the Thorner area   
 for more than five years. Many have   
 retired and then moved from Leeds to  
 Thorner because it is so quiet, unlike
 the city.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
