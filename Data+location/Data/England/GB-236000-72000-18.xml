 VISITORS OVER THE CENTURIES. THERE IS 
{NO HISTORICAL EVIDENCE}FOR EITHER THE 
{BLACK PRINCE OR CHARLES I}VISITING THE
 PARISH THOUGH IT IS POSSBLE THAT THEY 
 PASSED THROUGH IN THEIR TIME.WHAT IS  
 OF NO DISPUTE IS THAT THE{HOUSE OF    
{WINDSOR}HAVE MADE MANY AND FREQUENT   
 VISITS TO THE AREA. THIS MAINLY DUE TO
 A{FORMER RECTOR, CANNON L.M. ANDREWS, 
 WHO WAS{CHAPLAIN TO THE DUKE OF       
{WINDSOR, LATER KING EDWARD VIII. KING 
{GEORGE VI}FOLLOWED IN HIS BROTHER'S   
 FOOTSTEPS AND WITH{HIS QUEEN}VISITED  
 THE{DUCHY HOME FARM}ON SEVERAL        
 OCCASIONS. OUR PRESENT{QUEEN}VISITED  
 AS{PRINCESS ELIZABETH}AND AGAIN WITH  
{THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH}ON HER FIRST    
 OFFICIAL VISIT IN{1956. PRINCE CHARLES
