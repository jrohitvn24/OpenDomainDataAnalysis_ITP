		<content> Each friday I wake up at 8 a.m. and   
 get ready for school.I put on a cotton
 shirt,a vest,underpants,socks,some    
 shorts and a jumper.I go downstairs   
 and have my breakfast.My breakfast    
 consists of two Weetabix with         
 milk.After that i have an egg or a    
 bacon sandwich.                       
   I set off for school at five to     
 nine.I get there just in time.        
   At school we have an assembly.This  
 lasts for about twenty minutes.After  
 that we have bank while we are having 
 English.We usually read a story and   
 then have to answer questions.The     
 answers are hidden in the story.Each  
 Friday it is our turn to use the      
 computer.After playtime we do maths   
 for an hour until 12 p.m. We have a   
 playtime while the younger children   
 are eating lunch. ctd.P.7
