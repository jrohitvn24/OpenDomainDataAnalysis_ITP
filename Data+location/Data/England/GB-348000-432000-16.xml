		<title>16Tanterton Area</title>
		<content>  This area has become residential     
since county council allowed it to be  
developed by private builders and the  
Central Lancashire Development         
Corporation who have been filling it   
with {housing} estates.Many of the     
people interviewed liked the area,but  
the younger people felt that a more    
active night life was needed.          
  In the area there is a new {primary  
school} called {Poole House} built to  
provide places for the large number of 
children that have moved into the area 
with their parents.250 children attend 
the school every day.Two years ago     
only 120 went there.{Shops} in the     
centre of the so called village help   
pensioners and parents with toddlers   
going into town to do their basic      
shopping.The local pub built specially 
in the area is called the Falkland's   
Heroes.                                </content>
