		<title>17STOCKTON -- OUR TOWN</title>
		<content> I like Stockton because it is a good  
 town to live in. No matter where you  
 are there will always be a shop       
 whether a small shop selling sweets   
 and tobacco or a larger shop selling  
 these as well as wines and spirits    
 etc. Stockton has a library which is  
 very handy to find out things for     
 schoolwork such as topics or homework.
 Older people go to the library to read
 the books while they are there rather 
 than take the books home with them.   
 Across the road from the library is   
 the swimming baths which has just been
 modernised by putting in a leisure    
 pool as before they only had a diving 
 pool as well as the main swimming     
 pool. The problem is that before the  
 new pool was built the entrance fee   
 was:- CHILDREN  15pence ADULTS 25pence
 but now it is CHILDREN 25p ADULTS 50p.
