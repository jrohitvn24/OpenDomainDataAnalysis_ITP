		<title>15HOME LIFE IN PAXFORD AREA</title>
		<content> As the population of this area tends  
 to be elderly, there are many people  
 living alone.All children must travel 
 to schools in surrounding villages,   
 usually by bus, and their mothers     
 often go out to work. Whereas most    
 cooking is done by electricity, solid 
 fuel is the main source of home       
 heating. There is much freezing and   
 preserving of local produce, and      
 whilst gardening is a popular hobby,  
 most gardeners concentrate on flowers 
 and shrubs, since fruit and vegetables
 are so easily and cheaply obtained.   
 Many pets are kept,mostly cats and    
 dogs. Most householders own a washing 
 machine, vacuum cleaner, television   
 and record or cassette player.Some    
 have video recorders, and home        
 computers are popular with children.  
 The majority of families own a car and
 many have two vehicles.               </content>
