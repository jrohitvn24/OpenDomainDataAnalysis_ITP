		<title>06The Ratby Band</title>
		<content>{Mrs Watts took us to see the band play
 on Friday night.At the interval we    
 asked them some questions.            
      There were 28 people playing and 
 there is a junior band which has about
 30 people members.The band started in 
 1906.At present, ten different        
 instruments are played.The biggest and
 the lowest is the Bb bass or a tuba   
 and the smallest is a soprano         
 cornet.The band practices twice a     
 week-Sunday morning and Thursday      
 evening.They are very popular in      
 Leicestershire and also play in other 
 countries such as:-                   
                                       
 Belgium,Holland,France and Germany.   
 Their most embarassing moment was when
 the base fell off the back of a       
 bandstand in the middle of a          
 performance.
