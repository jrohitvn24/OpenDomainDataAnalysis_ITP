 Pop music is played on{Radio 1}mainly 
 and can be a powerful thing as was    
 seen at Christmas 1984 and on the 14th
 July 1985 with{Band Aid}and{Live Aid. 
 When the world was first really shown 
 the horror of the famine in Ethiopia  
{Bob Geldorf}lead singer of{the        
{Boomtown Rats}decided he had to do    
 something about it. So he organised a 
 gathering of any pop stars that cared 
 to come and recorded a record called  
{"Do They Know it's Christmas"}all     
 profits from this record went to help 
 the starving.                         </content>
