		<content>  At school we have 3 playtimes.During 
 the morning and afternoon breaks I    
 play football.At lunchtime I play     
 cricket.On Tuesdays and Thursdays we  
 have P.E. in which we play 'had' and  
 we do exercises.In the summer the     
 children who have packed lunch play   
 tennis with their lunchboxes and a    
 bat.Also,I like to play with my       
 electronic games.I've got 4 electronic
 games.My favourite is Starforce.I will
 tell you about it.The game has seven  
 phases.You have nine lives in the     
 first phase.The enemy come down and   
 you have to try and shoot them,but    
 watchout they might shoot you.The game
 gets harder from one phase to the     
 next.My other games are called        
 Skyfighter,Juggler and King Kong New  
 York.Electronic games are very        
 exciting. By Jatinder Chaggar
