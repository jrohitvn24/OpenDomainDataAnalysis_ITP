		<content>  There are two churches in Steeple    
 Morden,one church is called St. Peter 
 &amp; St. Paul and a chapel which isn't   
 very well attended,we usually practice
 in the chapel but if we have a        
 service due we practice in the        
 churcwell attended,we usually practice
 in the chapel but if we have a service
 due we practice in the churches,most  
 of our services are in Litlington     
 Church which is called St. Catherine. 
  The church is near some old peoples' 
 homes and the old people like to see  
 the choir singing in all our robes and
 it is very good for them because the  
 church is near to them.               
  The choir is very old because        
 near the choir seats there is a       
 flag which is very old and fragile    
 which says Steeple Morden choir.
