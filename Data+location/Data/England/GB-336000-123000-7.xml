		<title>07Main Features of Curry Rivel</title>
		<content> ,Parts of the Burton Pynsent Farm can 
 be traced back to the original        
 Doomsday Book.  Since then bits have  
 been added to it.  It is now owned by 
 Mr and Mrs Shroder.                   
 There is a monument on the hill almost
 opposite the house.  It was built     
 there in the memory of Sir William    
 Pynsent. It has 170 steps and it used 
 to be open to the public but it is now
 closed for restoration. The monument  
 is not as old as the house.           
 Curry Rivel church dates back to the  
 13th century, the oldest part is the  
 north chapel, where there can still be
 found remains of skeletons in some of 
 the stone tombs. The oldest bit of    
 stained glass in the church is a bit  
 of the stained glass from Canterbury  
 Cathedral. A window on the north wall 
 shows Saint George and the Dragon,King
 Ina of Wessex and King Alfred.        </content>
