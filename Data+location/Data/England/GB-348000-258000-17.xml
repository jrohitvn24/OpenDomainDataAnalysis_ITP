		<title>17LEOMINSTER POLICE STATION</title>
		<content> We visited the police station and our 
 guide was P.C. Wilson. They have four 
 cells and two had just been decorated.
 Two detention rooms are used for      
 detaining runaway children and drunks.
 Exactly two hundred and fifteen       
 arrests have been made this year. Any 
 policeman who makes an arrest must    
 have a good reason to explain to the  
 sergeant, otherwise he is in big      
 trouble. The arrested people are      
 brought in through a barred door and  
 put in a cell.                        
 Then we went to the radio room where  
 there were C.B.'s and two way radios. 
 They had a radio that calls out to    
 Tenbury Wells, Hereford and Bromyard. 
 A teleprinter is used to send telex   
 messages and the radio man phoned     
 Hereford and they sent us a telex     
 message - Hope the children of{       
{Leominster}Junior enjoyed their visit.</content>
