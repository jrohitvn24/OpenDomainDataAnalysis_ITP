		<content> The post mistress gets up at half past
 five during the week.  She opens the  
 post office and shop at quarter past  
 eight, except on Saturdays when       
 opening time is nine o'clock and she  
 closes at one o'clock on Wednesdays   
 and Saturdays and half past five on   
 other days.  The post man comes from  
 Doncaster every day except Sunday to  
 deliver and collect the mail.  The    
 post woman sorts the letters and      
 parcels and then delivers them in the 
 village on her bicycle.  The shop     
 sells sweets, drinks, magazines,      
 cards, books and general goods.  Her  
 best selling items are newspapers.    
 Other popular items are cans of       
 lemonade and blocks of chocolate.  The
 busiest day in the post office is     
 Thursday when people come in to       
 collect their pensions
