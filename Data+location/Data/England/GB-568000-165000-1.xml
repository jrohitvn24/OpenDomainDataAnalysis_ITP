		<content> In our block there is one village     
 called{Cuxton}which is situated in a  
 dry valley among chalk hills. The main
 feature of this area is beautiful     
 woodland criss-crossed by public      
 footpaths. The best known is the{North
{Downs Way,}formally the{Pilgrims' Way.
 Part of the{woodland}is an area of    
 Special Scientific Interest. There are
 six farms in the block. Most of these 
 are arable but a few have sheep and   
 cows. A number of{disused chalk pits  
 is evidence that chalk has been       
 excavated here, for over a hundred    
 years, for the manufacture of cement. 
 The{Rugby Portland Cement Works}at    
 Halling is the only major industry.   
{The River Medway}flows through this   
 area, and is tidal at this point.
