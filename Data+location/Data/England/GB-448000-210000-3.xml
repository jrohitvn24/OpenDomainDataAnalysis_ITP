		<title>03CUTTESLOWE WALLS</title>
		<content>  There had always been a fence which  
 separated the council estate at       
 Cutteslowe  from the privately owned  
 houses.                               
  In December 1934 this fence was      
 strengthened into a wall at great     
 inconvenience to the council estate   
 residents.They complained and were    
 supported by the Communist Party.This 
 led to an enquiry in July 1936.       
  In 1938 the walls were demolished but
 the city were immediately told to     
 rebuild by the private residents in a 
 court order.                          
  In 1943 the walls were knocked down  
 by a tank on manoeuvres and were again
 rebuilt.They were finally demolished  
 in 1959.
