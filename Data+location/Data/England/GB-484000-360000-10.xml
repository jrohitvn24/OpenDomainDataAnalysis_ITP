		<title>10SWINDERBY PLAY AREA.</title>
		<content>   The field was  bought  by the{Parish
{Council}at  the beginning of 1970. The
 first committee was  for  fund raising
 only,  but   in   1974   a  management
 committee was formed and officers were
 elected at its  first  meeting on  the
 12th December, 1974.It  has 12 members
 and  the  original   secretary  still 
 serves on the committee today.        
   In 1975 a  grant  was  given  by the
{Lincolnshire   Association  of  Parish
{Councils}to improve the site; drainage
 was done first  and  then  the  access
 road.This  was completed with the help
 of recruits from RAF Swinderby.       
   Next the  mound  was constructed and
 the  play  area  is  now  used  as  an
{adventure}play area.In 1984 new swings
 and climbing frames were bought.Next a
 slide  is to be installed.The field is
 used for the  Annual{Bonfire Party} in
 November and for the village galas.   </content>
