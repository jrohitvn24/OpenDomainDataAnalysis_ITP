		<title>03Recent History of Herm.</title>
		<content> In 1946 Herm was bought from the      
 English Crown for Â£15,000 by the      
 States of Guernsey. The guiding       
 principle in the control to be        
 exercised by the States of Guernsey   
 was "That the natural attractions and 
 peacefulness of the island are        
 preserved, and are made available to  
 all who visit it."                    
 In 1949 Major &amp; Mrs. Peter Wood took  
 over the tenancy of the island and now
 have a lease which will run until     
 2029.                                 
 The Wood family have developed the    
 island as a thriving community based  
 on farming and tourism, while         
 preserving the "natural attractions   
 and peacefulness of the island."
