  In the Domesday Book,only one        
Brampton(Saxon for Briar,or Bramble    
farm) is mentioned.Church Brampton held
a long narrow strip of land a field    
width from the Nene to Holdenby East   
Lodge.The prefix Church was first used 
in 1287.The origin of Harlestone is    
possibly from the Saxon "Harle" meaning
draw and "Stone",a reference to the    
local stone quarries.There is no longer
a village at Althorp which was         
depopulated.                           
  There are several old buildings in   
the villages,the most interesting being
the "Dovecote" in Harlestone.It was    
built in 1320 to serve one of the      
manors and was constructed to provide  
nesting for 400 pairs of birds.        
  Horse racing was held on Harlestone  
Heath,which was part of the heaths     
covering 18th.century Northamptonshire.</content>
