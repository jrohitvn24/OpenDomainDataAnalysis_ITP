		<content>    Although one person has lived in   
 his house for 60 years and 17% have   
 been there for over 25 years, the 30% 
 who have lived in their houses for    
 under 5 years shows that there is some
 mobility in the local population. The 
 80 households surveyed were occupied  
 by 118 men and 132 women of whom 90   
 poeple were in full time employment.  
 However of the 200 remainder, 30% did 
 part-time work.
