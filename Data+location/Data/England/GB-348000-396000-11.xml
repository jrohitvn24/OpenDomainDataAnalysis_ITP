		<title>11Vandalism in North St.Helens</title>
		<content> There are different types of{         
{vandalism.}The most common is {       
{graffitti }which appears written every
 where in our area. Bottlebanks,       
 toilets, walls, telephone boxes and   
 signs are all favourite targets. Much 
 of the graffitti  is done with felt   
 tip pens and carving on wooden targets
 is done. Telephone boxes have their   
 sets ripped out and window smashed.   
 Toilets have to be boarded up due to  
 constant misuse as do empty houses.   
{Vandalism}occurres in some public     
 houses with damage to the fittings    
 being all too common.{Plastic waste   
{bins}have been constantly set on      
 fire and this destroys the bins.      
{Windleshaw Brook}having been cleared  
 by the Water Board had rubbish thrown 
 in within days, litter was everywhere.
