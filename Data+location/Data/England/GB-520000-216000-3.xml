		<content>  The area is of a dry upland          
 character, the average height above   
 sea level is 115 metres falling to    
 75/65 in the river valley. The land is
 mostly clay with flints on the        
 hilltops, chalk on the hillsides and  
 river gravel in the valley.           
  Rainfall is relatively low averaging 
 less than 30 inches per year.         
  Pollution of the air and river is    
 negligable.                           
  Alder and willow trees grow near the 
 river, oak and hornbeam in the wooded 
 areas. The woodlands abound with wild 
 flowers, bracken and fungi, but road  
 improvement, close trimming and the   
 use of pesticides have led to the loss
 of some wayside flowers. The district 
 affords sanctuaries for wildlife and  
 gamebirds. Public footpaths and       
 bridleways are numerous and well used.
