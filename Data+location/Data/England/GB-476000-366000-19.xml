		<content>   Near Weston, there is an oil        
 extraction unit known colloquially as 
 a{Nodding Donkey.}It is owned by B.P. 
 and is one of several onshore units   
 in the region. A vertically drilled   
 shaft is tapping the same underground 
 source as other units, from a depth of
 about{1200m.}All units are linked to a
 gathering tank from where the oil is  
 sent to a refinery. The units produce 
 a{light oil}of 40 deg. A.P.I. grade,  
 which is low in gas content, and      
 refines to{ethylene, aviation fuels   
 and{distillates. }                    
   E. Midlands production is approx.   
 2000 barrels/day, increasing to 3000  
 by the end of '85.(National onshore   
 production is approx. 8500 barrels per
 day.) Britain has a reciprocal        
 international agreement to exchange   
 excess light oil for heavy oils, to   
 supply other needs, such as bitumens. </content>
