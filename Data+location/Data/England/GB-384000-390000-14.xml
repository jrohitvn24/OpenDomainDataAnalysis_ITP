		<title>14MUSLIMS IN STOCKPORT</title>
		<content>{CULTURE:}As well as going to Tithe    
 Barn School we also go to our own     
 school several evenings every week.   
 Our school is for Muslims from        
 Bangladesh.We learn to read Arabic so 
 we can read the Qu'ran. The Qu'ran is 
 the holy book of Islam and it includes
 the prayers that we should say 5 times
 a day. We also learn our own language,
 Bengali,which we sometimes use at     
 home.                                 
{FOOD:}As well as English food we eat  
 our own special foods. We eat special 
 Halal meat and nothing from pigs.We   
 like curries,samosas,kebabs and       
 Tandoori chicken.We use lots of       
 different spices.                     
{RAMADAN:}Every year Muslims are       
 supposed to fast for 30 days during   
 Ramadan. We cannot eat between sunrise
 and sunset. After 30 days we have a   
 special festival called Id Mubarak.   </content>
