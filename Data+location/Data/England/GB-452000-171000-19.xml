		<title>19FRILSHAM-SUPERNATURAL MYTHS</title>
		<content> The church at Frilsham is dedicated to
{St Frideswide or Fredeswitha}who was  
 born in Oxford in the 8th century. Her
 father was a Saxon prince. From a     
 child she devoted herself to the sick 
 and poor. Her father bought a religous
 house for her at Oxford. To escape the
 attentions of Algar a noble, she lived
 in the forest in a swineherds hut     
 eventually returning to Oxford where  
 she died. Her relics are a shrine in  
 Christchurch. Her day is October 19th.
 Many miracles are attributed to       
 her{especially cures for blindness.   
 On Frilsham Common there is a well    
 with very old holly trees around it.  
 Legend has it that Frideswide had a   
 cell here and blessed the well. It    
 never runs dry and the water is said  
 to have healing properties. There is a
{window of her in Frilsham Church      
 showing a swinehut and Faircross well.</content>
