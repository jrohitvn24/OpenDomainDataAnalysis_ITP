		<title>10SOUTH END SCHOOL-POST WAR</title>
		<content> In March 1942 it was decided that the 
 area beneath the school was ideal for 
 the making of meals for the children. 
 At first 142 meals were prepared. The 
 older boys took over allotments to    
 grow vegetables for the kitchen.  The 
 kitchen was so successful that by     
 September it was extended to provide  
 almost 200 container meals for        
 surrounding schools.                  
 In January 1953 the infants moved to a
 new building at Cross Lane.  The      
 Infants Department being taken by the 
 Girls School.  In 1958 Elland Grammar 
 School became Brooksbank Comprehensive
 School at which time the children over
 11 years old were transferred unless  
 they were in their final years in     
 which case they stayed at South End   
 until they finally left.
