		<title>06HOW WE COMMUTE.</title>
		<content>Rainham is well within the community   
hinterland of London.This is clearly   
shown by the numbers of people who use 
the station each day.Many people travel
by car and by coach too.Also,the growth
in the number of houses,particularly   
housing estates such as Wigmore,are    
directly related to the increasing     
numbers of people who commute to London
each day.The reasons for commuting are 
several.Firstly,house prices are much  
lower here than in outer London which  
means that they can live in larger,    
better quality houses than would other 
wise be the case.Secondly,Rainham is on
the edge of the built up area of the   
Medway towns conurbation,and therefore 
close to open farmland and the remnants
of extensive beech woodland.It is a    
good commuting area,as there are good  
roads and a good railway services      
mainly into London.                    </content>
