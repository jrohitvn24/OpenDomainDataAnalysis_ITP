		<title>02The Yaxham Area</title>
		<content> In common with much of Norfolk the    
 people of this area rely strongly on  
 neighbouring towns for employment and 
 services. However, apart from farming 
 which directly or indirectly still    
 provides work for quite a good        
 number of people, there are numerous  
 small businesses.  Some of these will 
 be described on page 9.               
                                       
 The life of the area is encouraged by 
 participation both from those who have
 lived in the villages for generations,
 as well as the many people who make up
 the rapidly expanding Norfolk         
 population of young and retired       
 people.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
