{   The school}takes children aged from
 five to nine, from the villages of    
 Winterbourne Stoke, Berwick St. James 
 and Stapleford.  At the age of nine   
 the children move to Wilton Middle    
 School.  At present there are 26      
 children in the school which is an    
 indication of how few young families  
 there are in the villages.  The       
 children are divided into two class   
 groups.  There has always been the    
 worry for parents that the school     
 might have to close because of low    
 numbers.  As an indication of         
 population trends the age spread of   
 the present pupils is:                
                                       
     Juniors (7-9) : 4 children        
                                       
     Infants (5-7) : 22 children
