		<content> Marshfield used to be in              
 Gloucestershire but since 1974 has    
 been in the County of Avon (though the
 postal address is Wiltshire!), and in 
 the District of Northavon.  Rates are 
 high, being 189 1/2 pence per pound   
 for domestic properties.  It has its  
 own Parish Council of nine members    
 (Chairman,{John Kitley;}Clerk,{John}  
{Humphreys).} Meetings are held on     
 alternate Tuesdays in the Tolzey Hall 
 and are open to the public, though few
 attend, even for the Annual Meeting.  
 Recent concerns have been over        
 planning, conservation, car parking in
 the High Street and other traffic     
 problems, the Plan for the Parish for 
 the next decade and the Best Kept     
 Village Competition.  The Parish      
 Council are also concerned with the   
 new Community Centre Project.
