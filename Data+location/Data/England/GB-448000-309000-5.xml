		<content> Every morning in our house I get my   
 own breakfast. It is one small bowl of
 cornflakes and a drink of orange      
 juice.I have sandwiches at school. I  
 make my own normally.I have 1 or 2    
 cobs with cheese in the middle and my 
 other brothers and sisters make their 
 own too.My dad has a sandwich too     
 because my mum is in bed as she works 
 as a night nurse.On Friday nights my  
 dad prepares a Chilli con Carne and   
 some mashed potatoes.When we have     
 finished there is a rota to see who   
 does the washing up.On Sundays we all 
 have mashed potatoes,vegetables and   
 Yorkshire pudding and beef.For pudding
 we have fruit crumble or rice         
 pudding.When we have finished my older
 brother and sister wash up.For tea we 
 have salad and different kinds of cold
 meats with jelly and ice cream for    
 afters.                               </content>
