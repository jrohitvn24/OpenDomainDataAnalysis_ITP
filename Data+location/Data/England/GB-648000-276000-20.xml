		<content> The area of Southwold and Reydon,     
 particularly Southwold,is a paradox:  
 it is several miles from the nearest  
 major road and badly signposted. As a 
 result, it is a holiday resort which  
 is only visited by people who know of 
 its existence because they have       
 previously visited it.                
   Its isolation and the out_of_date   
 attitudes of the local residents (who 
 want to preserve the area without any 
 change) are among the reasons why many
 people enjoy visiting Southwold,thus  
 causing the character of the town to  
 change during the Summer.             
   For these reasons also people wish  
 to retire to the area and this causes 
 significant changes in the population 
 and the nature of the area itself.    
   Under these pressures it will be    
 interesting to see how long the area  
 can survive in its present form.      </content>
