		<content> Situated at Lanehead, the hall serves 
 as a community meeting place for the  
 surrounding district.  Built of wood  
 with a corrugated iron roof, it is    
 well maintained.  A hard-working      
 committee organise money-raising      
 events and help in practical ways to  
 keep it so.  Recent work has included 
 improvements to the kitchen &amp; cloak-  
 rooms, complete re-wiring &amp;           
 re-decorating inside and out.  It is  
 used regularly for Parish Council and 
 Women's Institute meetings. Other     
 lettings include Keep Fit and Country 
 Dancing, whist drives, dances, coffee 
 mornings, Leek Club show, an ADAS     
 meeting re tourism, a Harvest Supper  
 which raised money for cancer research
 and a table tennis tournament.  During
 the summer two ladies hired the hall  
 to make teas for the tourists.
