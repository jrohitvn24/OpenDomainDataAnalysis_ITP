		<title>10Life at the Bury farm,Stev.</title>
		<content>   Mr.and Mrs. Warner-Smith have lived 
 at the{Old Bury}for 27 years,but the  
 farm has been in the family for many  
 years.Mrs.Warner-Smith likes living in
 this very{old house,}she said the nic-
 est thing was the atmosphere,and the  
{graveyard}behind doesn't worry them at
 all.She has to do things a normal     
 wife wouldn't do,like looking after   
 cattle,helping with the{harvesting    
 and from{March to June}feeding the    
 pheasants in the evening.             
   They have three{workers}living and  
 helping on their 130 acres;but also   
 rent some grazing land for their beef 
 cattle.On their land they grow{wheat, 
{oats,barley,beans and potatoes.}They  
 enjoy the open-air life,although they 
 hate working outside when it's cold.  
 Mr.Warner-Smith said the funniest     
 thing he has seen on the farm was a   
 cow pulling a man along by a rope!    </content>
