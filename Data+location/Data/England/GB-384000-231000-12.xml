		<title>12FORTHAMPTON FETE</title>
		<content> The annual Forthampton fete was held  
 on Saturday 31 August 1985 in the     
 gardens of the Court. This, and the   
 annual Fun Run are the only           
 significant events on the Forthampton 
 calendar. The money raised at the fete
 goes to the church. There were a few  
 stalls selling home-grown produce,    
 pots of jam and cakes  and a skittle  
 alley. It was also possible to be     
 taken on a tour of the  house. In all 
 there were about sixty people at the  
 fete and the majority of these were in
 the older age ranges. Here is further 
 evidence of the population imbalance  
 in the village. The fete also showed  
 how the community draws even closer   
 together for such an event. Many of   
 those living in the village ran the   
 stalls and it can be assumed that     
 almost everyone knew each other.
