 At 8 am in the morning I got up and at
 8:15 I had my breakfast. After        
 breakfast I cleaned my face and teeth.
 At five to nine I started up to       
 school. We had a few minutes play then
 I went into school and the register   
 was taken. Then the infants came and  
 we had Assembly. After that we had    
 arithmetic. Then we saw the coach     
 coming to take us swimming at Shefford
 Lower School. Before that I had a few 
 minutes play then I came back to      
 collect my swimming bag. We got on the
 coach and went swimming. At midday  we
 had lunch and I stayed for a packed   
 sandwich meal. For lunch I had an     
 apple, sandwiches and some            
 crackerbreads. After lunch we had an  
 hour and a quarter play in that time  
 we played tag and a shape game.       </content>
