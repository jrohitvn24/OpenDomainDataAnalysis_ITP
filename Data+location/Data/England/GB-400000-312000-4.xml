		<title>04COAL MINING - HEDNESFORD</title>
		<content>  During the nineteenth century,       
Hednesford developed as a mining town. 
In the early part of the twentieth     
century there were seven pits working  
in the area.By 1975 only 3 collieries  
remained,providing employment for 5,200
men.On 17th December 1982 the last pit 
West Cannock No.5, known locally as    
Â£Tackeroo' ceased production and the   
400 men employed there were retired or 
offered employment elsewhere.          
  Today Hednesford is no longer a      
Â£mining town',although some residents  
work in neighbouring pits.There are    
plans for an open cast mine to open.   
Many people who now live in Hednesford,
particularly those living on the new   
estates built on the reclaimed land,   
now commute to the large conurbations  
of Birmingham and Wolverhampton.Local  
employment is in the offices and shops 
of the town.                           </content>
