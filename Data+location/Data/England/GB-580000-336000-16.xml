		<content> Stanhoe derives its name from 'stony  
 ridge.'  The word stony may come from 
 the large numbers of Neolithic worked 
 flints which have been discovered over
 the past thirty years by an interested
 farm worker.  A mile to the east of   
 the village is an unmade road now     
 known to be Roman in origin.  This    
 crosses another probably Roman road   
 within the area surveyed.  The        
 east-west road is no longer complete  
 bus was once a pilgrimage route to the
 shrine at Walsingham.  Cross Lane,    
 once called Petergate, is named from  
 the core of a cross which once stood  
 at its north end as a marker.  Another
 stood at its south end and between    
 them a small chapel, St. Peter's on a 
 site now partially built on.  The     
 street names have all changed,        
 Deepdale is now Station Road,         
 Northgate to Docking Road and so on.  </content>
