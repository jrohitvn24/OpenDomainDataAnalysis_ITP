		<title>14  WHITEHOUSE FARM INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>Farm has been owned by Mr John Cross   
since 1950. He owns 80 acres plus 5.5  
from Burnt House Farm. It is a mixed   
farm with a small area for pasture but 
mainly arable. Small number of store   
pigs sold for swill fattening also 140 
head of calves sold at 5 months- some  
for beef some for dairy. Few Jersey and
Guernsey calves reared from birth for  
selling. Two thousand head poultry,    
rear day old chicks and table birds and
make 2 egg deliveries to Ipswich.      
 Have hand mill to grind their own     
corn to add to purchased vitamins for  
pig food. Farm possibly in first       
Domesday Book. Mr Cross's own family   
tree goes back to that date so they    
were probably a farming family before  
then but not at Whitehouse Farm. Parts 
of house 200 years old.                
1980's- Farmers still work long hours  
for not enough reward.                 </content>
