		<content>   Grampound Road expanded with the    
 arrival of The Great Western Railway  
 when a station was opened in 1859. The
 closure of the station in 1963 placed 
 its future in jeopardy but the past 20
 years have seen dormitory expansion   
 and development of light industry.    
 Today there are 2 pubs, a Post Office,
 2 shops, a garage, a wood store, a    
 building site and 2 factories.        
   Ladock grew up beside the river and 
 main road. There has been no major    
 housing development since the Council 
 houses at Trethurffe were built in    
 1970. It is now classed as a Non-     
 development village. There is only    
 one shop with a Post Office and a pub.
   The nearest doctors are at Probus   
 which is 2 miles from either village. 
 Shops, banks etc are at Truro or      
 St.Austell but big department stores  
 are at Plymouth 50 miles away.        </content>
