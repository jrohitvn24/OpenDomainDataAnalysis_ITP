		<title>07House renovation in Compton.</title>
		<content> A long low thatched cottage stands at 
 the junction of the main road and Ham 
 Lane. It was recently sold by its     
 dedicated owner who had completely    
 renovated it twice,having started this
 mammoth task about 14 years ago. When 
 Mr Fry bought this now delightful     
 residence,its only{water supply}was   
 from a pump in the garden,so his first
 job was to install mains water and    
 drainage. He totally wired up all the 
 electricity,had heating installed.Then
 just as he was{rethatching}it himself,
 it burnt down.He had to do everything 
 again, rethatching as well. This time,
 however, he impregnated the walls,    
 extended the byre into utility and    
 rear entrance hall,the milking parlour
 became the kitchen.The drawing room   
 was made up of the whole of the front 
 of the house.He built a separate      
 garage with study and store attached. </content>
