		<content> HOLME QUARRY HAS BEEN OPEN FOR ABOUT  
 100 YEARS.FOR 50 YEARS THEY HAD BEEN  
 BURNING LIME STONE TO MAKE PLASTER FOR
 BUILDING AND DRESSING STONES FOR      
 BUILDING HOUSES. THEY BURNED THE LIME 
 IN THE KILN WITH COKE AND COAL. ALL   
 THE PLASTER AND STONE WAS TAKEN BY    
 HORSE AND CART TO THE BUILDERS.       
 AFTER THE WAR THEY WERE MECHANISED AND
 STARTED USING CRUSHERS AND DUMPERS.   
 THEY STOPPED BURNING LIME BECAUSE THEY
 COULD GRIND IT.NOW THE STONE IS USED  
 FOR CONCRETE AND ROADS AND THE LIME   
 DUST IS FOR THE FARMERS TO PUT ON THE 
 FIELDS AND FOR MAKING BRICKS AND      
 BLOCKS FOR BUILDING.
