		<title>09HOUGHTON HALL-PRESENT OWNERS</title>
		<content> During the nineteenth century the     
 Cholmondeleys lived at Cholmondeley   
 castle and Houghton was not much used.
 In 1913,the fourth Marquess handed    
 Houghton to his eldest son,later the  
 fifth Marquess, on his marriage to    
 SYBIL of the SASSOON banking          
 family.The house was restored and     
 treasures added from the Cholmondeley 
 and Sassoon collections. The dowager  
 has continued to live at Houghton     
 since the MARQUESS' death in 1968.The 
 present MARQUESS makes his home at    
 CHOLMONDELEY CASTLE, but is concerned 
 with the running of the Houghton      
 estate and the opening of the house   
 including the STABLES and the MODEL   
 SOLDIERS which are his collection.He  
 also holds the office of LORD GREAT   
 CHAMBERLAIN to ELIZABETH 2nd. and this
 involves duties at the STATE OPENING  
 of PARLIAMENT.                        </content>
