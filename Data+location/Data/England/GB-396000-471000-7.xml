		<title>07TRANSPORT IN KETTLEWELL</title>
		<content>   There is at present a daily service 
 by West Yorkshire Bus Company from    
 Skipton of four buses each day, none  
 on Sundays in the winter.  Grammar    
 School children catch the early (7.30 
 a.m.) bus to Skipton, returning on the
 last bus at 5 p.m.  A private company 
 is in process of negotiating for the  
 franchise.  Some summer Sunday        
 services cater for travel to Hawes and
 Keld.  The local garage runs a school 
 bus for pupils at the primary school  
 and at Upper Wharfedale taking a      
 complicated route to pick up children 
 from Cray, Langstrothdale and         
 Littondale.                           
   The main road through the village is
 the B.6160 with a side road to        
 Coverdale and beyond via the dangerous
 Park Rash.  Private cars are almost   
 essential, and older residents and non
 drivers rely on friends for help.     </content>
