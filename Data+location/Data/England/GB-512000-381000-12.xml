		<content>    Agriculture in this area is        
 predominantly arable, with the main   
 crops being{wheat, barley, oilseed    
{rape and sugar beet.}Other crops may  
 be introduced to lengthen the         
 rotation. These are usually peas for  
 freezing or potatoes. There are also  
 relatively small areas of permanent   
 grassland, both improved and          
 unimproved, used for grazing animals. 
 The area of pasture land has          
 diminished in recent years, as farmers
 specialise in crop growing, following 
 changes in EEC policy over beef and   
 milk production. Farms are usually    
 about 300 acres, but farmers may let  
 part of their own land, or rent other 
 fields, for specific purposes. Some   
 farms are worked as parts of larger   
 units of three or more farms combined.
