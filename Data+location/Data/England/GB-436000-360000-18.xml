		<content>{What we do in our spare time at home: 
 In my Dad's spare time he usually     
 sits and reads for about an hour.     
 Sometimes if he wants to, and if the  
 weather is sunny, he might do some    
 gardening or go for a walk but mostly 
 he's indoors.  My Mum is rather like  
 my Dad but she likes to go out        
 gardening and walking unlike my Dad.  
 If it's raining she will drink a cup  
 of tea or coffee.  I like going out   
 whatever the weather really but       
 sometimes I stay in stamp collecting, 
 drawing and making things.

   My Dad mostly reads the paper and   
 watches tv.  My Uncle's hobby is      
 gardening and keeping old coins. My   
 Mum's hobbies are keeping flowers and 
 reading.  My hobbies are making cows  
 soft, watching swallows, riding my    
 bike and mowing the lawn.             </content>
