		<title>15THE CAR RIDE</title>
		<content> The blue, shiny machine waits         
 patiently. It is a lonely car standing
 silently and very still. The owner    
 sits in his seat. A turn of the key   
 and the engine roars and wheels turn  
 slowly. Four pistons go up and down.  
 Petrol is pumped. Fumes travel along  
 the exhaust pipe and pollute the air. 
 A turn of a knob and music fills the  
 inside of the vehicle. Needles flick  
 sideways showing the speed, the petrol
 and the temperature. The wheels begin 
 to turn very quickly as the car races 
 over the road. Trees and houses pass  
 quickly by. The road is rough and     
 bumpy but the car has springs and     
 comfortable seats.A turn of the wheel 
 inside turns two wheels outside making
 the car travel safely round bends and 
 corners. One foot pressed on a pedal  
 and the car slows, stops.
