		<title>04     LOOKING AT PEOPLE</title>
		<content> After the 1981 census it was found    
 that, in the Kingstanding area,{65%}of
 the people were{over 65 years of age.}
 It was decided then, that any council 
 houses which became empty in the area 
 would be given to families with at    
 least three children, so since then   
 there have been more children moving  
 into the district. At the{local       
{library}many events are held for them.
 Those under five go with their mums   
 for storytime. Mums get a cup of      
 coffee and the children have squash.  
 Older children go to other events as  
 well. For the school summer break,    
 cookery, a fancy dress competition, a 
 dog show and a dried prune-eating     
 contest are planned.For old people    
 there are many large-print books,     
 coffee mornings and a home-delivery   
 service.                              
                                       </content>
