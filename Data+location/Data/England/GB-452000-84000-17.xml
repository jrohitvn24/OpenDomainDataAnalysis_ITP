		<title>17FOOTPATHS, ARRETON VALLEY</title>
		<content>     There are many footpaths in this  
 area, taking the walker across the    
 fields in the Yar Valley. The footpath
 from the Langbridge Church to Haseley 
 Manor is now closed but the old       
 railway track nearby can be used      
 instead.                              
     The long distance Bembridge Trail 
 in the north of this area is sited    
 alongside the ridge of chalk downs,   
 which extend along the length of the  
 Island from The Needles to Culver     
 cliff, Bembridge.  This trail passes  
 by Arreton School and takes the       
 traveller eastwards between Langbridge
 and Mersley Farm.                     
     The railway line between Sandown  
 and Shide with stations at Alverstone,
 Newchurch, Horringford, Merston and   
 Blackwater was opened in 1875 and     
 closed in 1956.  Some sections of the 
 old line are now used as footpaths.   </content>
