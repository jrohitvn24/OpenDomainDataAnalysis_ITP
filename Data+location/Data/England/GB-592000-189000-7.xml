		<title>07THE SAND PIT</title>
		<content> There is a large sand and gravel pit  
 in Barling. It was first started 26   
 years ago.Each day 500 tonnes are dug 
 out and sold.The pit produces pit     
 sand, sharp sand and soft washed sand 
 as well as stones of different sizes. 
 As the present workings are some way  
 from where the sand is sorted it is   
 loaded onto a conveyor belt which is  
 500 metres long. There is a safety    
 wire near the belt which stops if     
 anyone touches it. Before the sand is 
 dug out the topsoil is removed and    
 kept in a pile. Then all the sand is  
 taken. Rubbish lorries fill up the    
 hole. The refuse is sealed with clay  
 and the topsoil is put back. The land 
 can then be farmed again. Two of the  
 older parts of the pit have not been  
 filled in and  they are now full of   
 water.They are used for fishing and   
 many birds have their homes there.    </content>
