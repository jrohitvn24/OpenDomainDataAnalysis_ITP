		<title>10       A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> My name is Lee and I usually arrive at
 school at about 8:15am to play        
 football.After I have finished playing
 football which is about 9:00am I come 
 into class,take out my reading book   
 and read until assembly while the     
 teacher calls the register.After      
 assembly we normally do English.My    
 favourite English is writing stories. 
 Then it is playtime,at playtime there 
 is tuck being sold in the hall.After  
 play there is usually math-sets,but on
 Wednesdays there are none.At 12:00pm  
 we have dinner or sandwiches,then we  
 have another play.We do different     
 things in the afternoon such as topic,
 or craft,games or drama,music-workshop
 or science.Some people have football, 
 netball or orchestra practices and the
 school has its own outdoor,heated     
 swimming pool.The school ends at      
 3:15pm when we go home for our tea.   </content>
