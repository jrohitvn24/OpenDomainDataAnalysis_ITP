		<content> We conducted a survey of people in    
 Dunton Green to see what they thought 
 of the area. We only spoke to 23      
 people &amp; 19 of them liked living in   
 D.G.; most of the said they were born 
 here or they had family links and it  
 was fairly near their job and one said
 it was cheap. All 23 had been living  
 in D.G. most of their lives including 
 an old lady who has lived here for 77 
 years. 8 people think that D.G. is not
 bad for shopping facilities &amp; most    
 people would like to see a chemist. 15
 of those interviewed went to school   
 here. 10 people offered comments on   
 the motorway thinking you have to have
 motorways but not running through     
 villages.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
