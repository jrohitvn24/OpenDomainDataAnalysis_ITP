		<title>20LOCAL RESTAURANT</title>
		<content>    Shrimptons restaurant was built    
 of ships timbers and was made a       
 restaurant in 1969.  It was built in  
 1700 and received its name from the   
 first people to own it. They have two 
 full time workers and a few part-     
 timers. It used to be a post-office   
 and there once was a well that is     
 cemented over now.                    
    The owners are specialists in a    
 variety of carefully prepared French  
 dishes. The restaurant has a          
 widespread reputation but it is       
 expensive by local standards. Dinner  
 for two with wine can cost at least   
 Â£25.                                  
                                       
    This information was compiled      
 with much enjoyment and benefit by    
 the pupils and staff of Camelsdale    
 County First School.
