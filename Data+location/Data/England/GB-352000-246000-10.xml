		<title>10Village Life.</title>
		<content> Marden is a very thriving village and 
 has a great deal of life involving    
 a broad spectrum of modern and        
 traditional activities. Much of the   
 normal country occupations such as    
 farming, horticulture, horseriding,   
 and liesure-time pursuits are present.
 Religious, political and educational  
 groups tend to overlap and most people
 seem to wear several official "hats"  
 at some time or other. Church, Pub,   
 School, Trade and other organisations 
 often pool resources to provide       
 entertainment, assistance or to raise 
 funds for some enterprise or other.   
 Two examples of this are the Liaison  
 committee, a body consisting of       
 members of all the organisations,     
 formed to programme the village       
 calendar in an optimum fashion, and   
 the village sports and fete, where    
 funds are raised for specific items.  </content>
