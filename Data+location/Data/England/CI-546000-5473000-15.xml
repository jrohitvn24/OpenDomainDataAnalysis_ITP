		<title>15        TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> On Sark there are about 60 tractors.If
 you want to have a tractor you need a 
 licence which costs Â£10.00 and you    
 need to have a good reason to be      
 allowed to own a tractor.Tractors and 
 trailers are the main form of         
 transport for goods on Sark.          
 There are about 350 bicycles available
 for hire by visitors and most people  
 who live on the Island also own a bike
 because it is the easiest way to      
 travel.A bike licence costs Â£1.00.    
 On no account are cars allowed on the 
 roads.When the film "Mr Pye" was made 
 here they were allowed to bring a car 
 but had to remove the engine.The car  
 was towed by tractor and was used to  
 carry the camera.                     
 The only other form of transport on   
 the Island are horses and carts.
