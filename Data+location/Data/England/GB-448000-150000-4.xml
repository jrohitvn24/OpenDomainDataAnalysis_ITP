 The School is a prefabricated building
 erected in 1969. The main building has
 eight classrooms, various offices,    
 staff room, kitchen (where food is    
 prepared rather than simply served)   
 and a hall which is both for P.E. and 
 dining. It caters for chilren of just 
 under five years old until they are   
 eleven i.e. Primary School. There are 
 280 children and a teaching staff of  
 nine plus the headmaster, a full time 
 caretaker and various other staff. The
 sports facilities comprise a rugby    
 pitch, a football pitch, three netball
 courts &amp; an outdoor heated swimming   
 pool. The curriculum is broad based   
 with the emphasis as much on what is  
 taught as what is learned. Extra      
 curricular interests e.g. gymnastics, 
 recorder playing and singing are      
 taught in clubs. There is a P.T.A.    </content>
