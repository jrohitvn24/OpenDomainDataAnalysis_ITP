		<title>18BUILDINGS IN LITTLE BADDOW-1</title>
		<content>   Many varied styles of building can  
 be found in the village of Little     
 Baddow.This is a result of the many   
 centuries of habitation in the area.  
   The oldest type of housing in the   
 village are the half timbered         
 manors.Unfortunately many of the      
 original medieval timbered buildings  
 have long since disappeared but the   
 valuable timbers have been reused.    
   In the environs of Little Baddow    
 there are 2 manor houses;Little Baddow
 Hall and Tofts Manor.In origin these  
 date from the 11th century but they   
 have both been altered and rebuilt    
 over the years .Little Baddow Hall was
 first altered in the 14th century and 
  enlarged during Elizabethan          
 times.Tofts Manor too was enlarged in 
 Tudor times and rebuilt in the 19th   
 century by the Strutt family.Both of  
 the manors are now in private hands.  </content>
