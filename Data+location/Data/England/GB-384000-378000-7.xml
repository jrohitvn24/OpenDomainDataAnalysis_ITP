		<content> There are an adequate number of car   
 parks in the two main shopping        
 areas,Wilmslow and Alderley Edge."Pay 
 and Display" units are set up to      
 ensure that this facility is not      
{abused.}At the two railway stations   
 there is a{limited}amount of{free     
{parking space}for travellers who      
 commute to work each day.             
 Some of the traffic passing through   
 Wilmslow goes to{Manchester           
{International Airport}at{             
{Ringway,}about 3 miles away.It is the 
 third{largest airport}in{Britain.     
 Planes travel from Manchester to      
{America}and to most{European          
{countries.}In 1985 the news that      
 Stansted was to be extended worried   
 officials at M.I.A. but the actual    
 government proposals have not been as 
 bad as was at first thought.
