		<content>  {Three people were interviewed;}one  
 man, one woman and one boy.           
                                       
   The man,{Mr. Wright has lived in the
{village since 1971.}There had been no 
 changes since, and{he worked on a     
{farm,}which he rented.{There was no   
{entertainment,}so he went out of the  
 village. He said that 500 years ago,  
 it was as big as Thetford, and as     
 important.                            
                                       
  {He liked the village. It was quiet, 
{with the wildlife:}woodpeckers, lots  
 of deer and rare birds.{He rents 3000 
{acres of land}and owns 500 acres at   
 Bridgeham. He had two dogs. His       
{ancestors were not local.}He imagined 
 that there was a lot of poaching. He  
 saw a policeman maybe once a month.
