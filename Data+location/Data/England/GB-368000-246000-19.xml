		<content>   The{old manor house}at Cradley dates
 back to the 10th century and          
 successive generations altered and    
 added to it.  Today the oldest part is
 the kitchen and the{medieval chapel,  
 dovecot, tudor and georgian windows   
 and{daub and wattle}still remain.  The
{moat}which surrounded the house was   
 partially blocked in 1910 but still   
 remains alomng the sides and back of  
 the house.                            
   The house was used as a farm house  
 until 1982 but is now a country       
 house.  The owners have done much to  
 restore and preserve its old features.
 The barn next to the house has been   
 converted to a lounge and the stream  
 which ran beneath it has been diverted
 into the moat. {Elizabethan wall}     
{paintings}have been covered to prevent
 fading and the old{bread oven}and     
 fireplace have been restored.         </content>
