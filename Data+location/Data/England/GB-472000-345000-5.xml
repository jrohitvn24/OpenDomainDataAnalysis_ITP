		<content> The{Main St.}was designated a{conser- 
{vation area}some years ago. Most of   
 the houses are brick with pantile or  
 slate roofs, the majority dating to   
 the C18th, built either sideways to   
 the street or directly onto the road. 
 There is a small complex on Woods Lane
 of "executive" houses built in the    
 1970's not visible from the Main St.  
 There are three farms in the village  
 and four council houses on Inholms Rd.
{Flintham Hall,}a listed building, has 
 a famous{conservatory}built by Hine.  
 There is a church, a chapel and school
 the latter built in the 1960's. The   
 Old School is used by the village     
 after 3.30 as a village hall. The Main
 Street looks the same as it did over a
 hundred years ago, and is a most      
 attractive village to live in. Despite
 planning restrictions most villagers  
 wouldn't change the looks of Flintham.</content>
