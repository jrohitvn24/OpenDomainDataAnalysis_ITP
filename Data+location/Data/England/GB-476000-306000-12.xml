		<content>    {OWSTON HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT       
   There are no shops in Owston so     
 households have to be self_sufficient,
 particulary in the winter. Most people
 go shopping once or twice a week in   
 Oakham, Melton or Leicester, although 
 some tradesmen do call in the village.
 The milkman comes four times a week, a
 butcher once, and there is a          
 travelling grocer. Most people grow   
 some vegetables and some keep         
 chickens.                             
  All houses have mains water and most 
 households have an electric           
 refrigerator, deep freeze, washing    
 machine and vacuum cleaner, as well as
 other domestic appliances. One house  
 has a security alarm system. Fire     
 services come from Billesdon, Oakham  
 or Melton.                            
  All families have domestic pets. Four
 families keep horses for riding.      </content>
