		<title>10Tring Library</title>
		<content>    Last year the Library was in Akeman
 street but that one was closed and a  
 new one was built in the High Street. 
    When it was built the builders put 
 on the front of the Library lettering 
  saying "tring library".But lots      
 of people complained about the T and  
 the L so it was corrected.            
    Inside there is a copier that you  
 have to pay 10 pence a sheet to use.  
 Besides books,the Library lends tapes 
 and records.Part of the Library has   
 childrens and teenagers books,another 
 has tapes and records,the rest of the 
 Library has adults books and maps.    
    We did a survey of our school to   
 see how often the children use the    
 Library,25 children use the Library   
 once a week,28 children use the       
 Library once every 2 weeks,15 children
 use the Library once every 3 weeks,47 
 never use the Library.                </content>
