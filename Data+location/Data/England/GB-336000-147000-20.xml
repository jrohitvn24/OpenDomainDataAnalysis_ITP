		<title>20Mark People's Attitudes</title>
		<content> Mark is generally liked very much     
 because it is a friendly place and has
 a variety of clubs and activities.    
 Many would not like to see any changes
 at all. Some wanted a few more shops  
 -say a butchers or chemists. Some     
 wanted a car park, a swimming         
 pool,mains drainage and gas (some do  
 not have that in outlying areas).Older
 people like things to be as they have 
 always been. Listening to the Church  
 bells is one of their favourite       
 things.Mark people's general feelings 
 about Mark are summed up like this:"I 
 come down from Somerset but that don't
 really matter. I can't read,I can't   
 write but I can drive a tractor"!
