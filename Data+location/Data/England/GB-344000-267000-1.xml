		<title>01Leinthall Earls</title>
		<content> This area includes village of         
 Leinthall Earls and land to north and 
 east. Village lies in small valley and
 land rises steeply on eiter side. It  
 is a very rural, unspoilt area with   
 scattered dwellings amongst wooded and
 forested hills. Much of the land is   
 covered with deciduous and coniferous 
 forests. Where forests do no exist the
 hill slopes are predominantly         
 grasslands a mixture of intensively   
 managed grassland and enclosed rough  
 grazing on steeper areas.   Population
 of the area are mainly concerned with 
 agriculture.The only other significant
 source of employment is stone quarry  
 to the north of Leinthall Earls. One  
 mile north east of Leinthall earls    
 is Gatley Park which is home of the   
 Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire. The 
 area, being quite steep, is served by 
 very few roads 'C7 class roads        </content>
