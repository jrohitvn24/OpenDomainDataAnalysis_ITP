		<title>11TRAFFIC IN WALDERSLADE</title>
		<content>{Traffic Census:}                      
 Along Churchill Ave. and Walderslade  
 Road,in a quarter of an hour we saw   
 299 cars ,14 buses,83 vans,17 lorries 
 36 motorbikes,35 bicycles and 2       
 others.There were 2 milkfloats.       
{Road Conditions:                      
 The roads in some places were quite   
 good but in other places the roads    
 were worse. Along Walderslade Road    
 near the Library the roads needed more
 repairing because the frost and       
 snow had got to them.Some parts of the
 road have sloped to one side.One part 
 of the road is higher than the other. 
{Traffic Congestion:                   
 The traffic along Walderslade Road and
 Churchill Ave. was free flowing except
 at the traffic lights where there was 
 some congestion. The general flow of  
 traffic was good with few hold ups.
