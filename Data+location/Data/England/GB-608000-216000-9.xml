		<content> Shipbuilding has been the operation   
 carried on at the yard of James and   
 Stone. Here a variety of small vessels
 have been constructed. The range of   
 work has gone from small coasting     
 cargo ships ,fishing boats and similar
 craft for civilian customers to tank  
 landing craft, fast patrol boats and  
 air-sea rescue boats for military use 
 by a variety of countries and         
 governments.                          
                                       
 In the field of Boatbuilding there are
 a number of workshops, mainly using   
 glass fibre laminates. The products   
 range from cabin cruisers to day      
 boats,fast motor boats ( mostly of    
 outboard power supply. ) to small     
 tenders.
