		<title>16CASTLE FIELDS:HIGHAM FERRERS</title>
		<content>Castle Fields is a recreation ground on
the site of the Coney-garth or Rabbit  
Warren and Fishponds, which provided   
food for the nearby Castle.            
                                       
The area which had become overgrown    
with bushes etc. was tidied up in 1983.
On the 30th May 1985 the fair came to  
Castle Fields for three days. A survey 
about Higham fair was carried out by   
pupils of the Ferrers School. They     
asked a boy and girl from each class to
give their thoughts on the fair.       
                                       
The fair was most popular with the     
11-13 year olds. The older pupils      
thought the fair should have more rides
and stalls. Some of the rides were the 
Orbitor, Dodgems, Dive Bomber, a Ferris
Wheel and the Hustler. People felt that
the fair was not exciting enough, and  
that it did not stay long enough.      </content>
