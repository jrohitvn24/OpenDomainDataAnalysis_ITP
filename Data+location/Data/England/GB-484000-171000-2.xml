		<content> Binfield derives its name from the    
 coarse grass in this clearing of      
 Windsor Forest. Windsor Forest was    
 divided into 16 ('walkes') and        
 ('Binfield walk') was stocked with red
 and fallow deer for the king to hunt. 
 In the 16th century Sir Henry Neville,
 the keeper, lived at Billingbear.     
 Binfield Lodge was one of James I's   
 hunting lodges. Binfield Manor is     
 located next to the Forest Road.      
 In 1769 a Turnpike Trust improved the 
 Forest Road. This was already an      
 established 'drovers road' along which
 animals were driven to market. The    
 improved road enhanced the importance 
 of 2 inns: the Stag and Hounds in     
 Binfield where an ancient hollow elm  
 is said to mark the centre of Windsor 
 Forest and The Four Horse Shoes in    
 Warfield, now a private house.
