		<content>  The farmhouse is partly Victorian and
partly Georgian in design and was      
previously called Pleasure Farm. The   
farm itself consists of seventy acres  
and has been farmed since the 17th     
century.                               
  Both vegetables and fruit are grown  
on the farm, the vegetables being sold 
at the wholesale market, whilst the    
fruit is sold on a "pick-your-own"     
basis. This means that the general     
public pick fruit for themselves       
and are charged by weight.             
  There is a farm shop within the      
farmyard where the public can buy      
produce direct instead of from a local 
shop.                                  
  The farm is situated behind the      
Victoria Hospital and is typical of    
farms in the area producing fruit for  
the increasing number of people who    
enjoy picking their own.               </content>
