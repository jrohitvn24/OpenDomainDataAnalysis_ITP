		<title>01KINGSTON TO GORING COAST</title>
		<content> The coastal strips consists           
 predominately of residential estates  
 built since 1918, on flat coastal     
 plain. In the parish of Kingston the  
 Kingston Gorse Estate is a private and
 wealthy development of executive class
 houses. Such farmland as remains is   
 high quality arable. In Ferring the   
 estate is very mixed in quality, with 
 bungalows 'chalets' and houses forming
 an amorphous garden village. Open     
 space and greensward and been         
 maintained in Goring with a pleasant  
 grassed walk along the beach. The     
 housing here is more 'planned' and    
 middle class. The only commercial and 
 shopping centre is in Ferring to the  
 north of the survey area, but in the  
 centre of the village access to the   
 beach for holidaymakers is very       
 restricted in Kingston, but not       
 actively discouraged elsewhere.       </content>
