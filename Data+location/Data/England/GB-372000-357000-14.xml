		<title>14Shopping in Wheelock 2</title>
		<content>  Mrs Grimes thought shopping in       
 Wheelock had changed nowadays because 
 the roads are so busy,( we counted    
 over 500 vehicles an hour on Crewe    
 Road ).                               
  When we went down to the village to  
 count the shops and find out all the  
 names there were lorries on the path  
 and it was frightening because of the 
 traffic coming whizzing past.         
  Now there is Mrs Grimes the          
 greengrocer, Pete Hardy the butcher,  
 Harper's Village Stores, Austin's     
 Newsagents, the Post Office which     
 is run by Mrs Johnson and the Golden  
 Harvest Chinese chip shop.            
  Most people do a 'big shop' at the   
 supermarkets in Sandbach and Crewe and
 only go down to the village for little
 things. Some of the people in the     
 village don't go down to the village  
 at all.                               </content>
