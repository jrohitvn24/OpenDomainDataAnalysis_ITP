		<title>14SADBERGE OUR VILLAGE POEM</title>
		<content>                                       
 Sadberge is a pleasureful place,      
 Standing on a little hill.            
 Its got a green,with a tall flag pole 
 And an interesting jubilee stone.     
                                       
 In the village are two pubs           
 The Buck Inn and Three Tuns           
 People go to enjoy a drink            
 And see their friends each day.       
                                       
 Sadberge Village was a Roman camp,    
 So many years ago.                    
 But now there's not a Roman in sight, 
 Because they had to go.               
                                       
 I like Sadberge school                
 It can be lots of fun                 
 We do hard work                       
 But also sing and play.
