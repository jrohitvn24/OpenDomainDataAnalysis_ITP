		<content> Bradford's public transport history is
 one of  rivalry &amp; uncontrolled  growth
 which  resulted  in  two   unconnected
 railway termini and terminal nodes for
 routes at various points near the City
 centre.  On an {8\ acre site,  }within
 100m  of  the City Hall, a  functional
{"Interchange"  was opened in 1977 }for
 all public transport services  as well
 as some private vehicles.  Road access
 is direct  from  the city's inner ring
 road. A pedestrian concourse forms the
 spine of the  complex with  escalators
 up to six island platforms of the {bus
{station }which  handles  over  250 bus
 movements an hour at peak times. There
 is also access to {"Exchange"  Railway
{station }on  the  eastern edge  of the
 site.   The  interchange is a landmark
 because of its{unique glass roof}which
 covers  the  whole  site  like a giant
 wavy lilo.                            </content>
