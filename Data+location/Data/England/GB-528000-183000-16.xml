<title>16Somers Town/Euston</title>
<content>Somers Town tends to be one of the rougher areas of central London, and certainly one of the cheapest (at the moment at least). My flatmates and I attend the London School of Economics and this tends to be a popular area amongst students of both our university and UCL. Our street (Eversholt Street) is 'colourful' - containing many 'adult'shops. However, the area is generally not too unpleasant and it is not often we experience any crime; though as a 20 year old girl I would not want to wander around at night on my own. Most of the area is flats and a few pubs/small shops, but it is within walking distance to Camden Lock and most central London attractions (Covent Garden/Oxford St etc). There are also schools and at least two Catholic churches.  &lt;br />
