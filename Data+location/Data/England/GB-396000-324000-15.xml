		<title>15     HOO-MILL BOATYARD</title>
		<content>  Hoo-Mill Boatyard is situated on the 
Trent and Mersey Canal at Hoo-Mill     
Lock.  They make barges and narrow     
boats(the difference being that barges 
transport goods(coal,pottery,etc.) and 
a narrow boat carries people).         
  To buy a house boat you would have   
to pay about $15000 which compares     
with a  small house.Over the past 20   
years the amount of boats using the    
canal has started to increase because  
people have started to use the canals  
for leisure. Over the last 2 years     
however the amount of boats using the  
canal has decreased.  Most people      
using the canal now use it for leisure 
although there are still some barges   
carrying coal,pottery and gravel.Most  
canals have fish in them and a lot of  
fishermen use them.
