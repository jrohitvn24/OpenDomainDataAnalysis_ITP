		<title>06DARNFORD BROOK</title>
		<content>   On Tuesday June 11th we did some    
 work on{Darnford Brook}while we were  
 staying at{Lower Darnford Farm.       
   We measured a ten metre stretch of  
 stream putting a peg at every metre.We
 measured across 4m from every peg so  
 that we had a 10 x 4m rectangle, with 
 the stream inside.We measured the     
 distance of each bank from our pegs   
 and drew the shape of the banks in our
 books.                                
   Then  we decided on a key and mapped
 areas of quiet water with a sandy     
 bottom ,white water with a stony      
 bottom, reeds, trees and other things.
   We measured the depth of the stream 
 at each metre and we collected animals
 from different areas we found a       
{bullhead ,caddis fly larvae,mayfly    
{nymphs,}a{leech,}a{shrimp,}and a clump
 of{eggs.                              
                                       </content>
