		<title>02The Great Landslip of 1839</title>
		<content> Mr Barns pointed out to us that       
 Dowlands was the site of the Great    
 Landslip of Christmas, 1839 when      
 8,000,000 tons of land subsided taking
 cottages, orchards and fields with    
 it,to form the feature known as Goat  
 Island and the great chasm between it 
 and the mainland cliff. Fortunately   
 the cottagers living there, used as   
 they were to the occasional falls of  
 chalk from the cliff face, had some   
 early warnings and moved out of their 
 houses before the 8,000,000 tons of   
 land slipped into the sea.  According 
 to Mr Barns's pamphlet, obtainable    
 from the Seaton TIC, this was the     
 greatest landslip ever to occur in    
 Britain. The deep chasm or ravine is  
 more than a half mile in length       
 approaching 80 yards in breadth and   
 varying in depth from  100 to 150     
 feet.                                 </content>
