   The playgound at Harewood House was 
 built in 1975.Originally the area was 
 waste land.It is constructed of wooden
 logs with wooden nails or bolts.The   
 most recent structure is a circle of  
 logs which took between 2 and 3 months
 to make.                              
                                       
   It is mainly used by children,but   
 adults up to the age of 95 have       
 participated! Between 3000 and 20000  
 people visit the playground at the    
 weekend,that is about 80% of the      
 visitors to the House.There are about 
 2 accidents each week in the high     
 season.
