 for a military prison in 1862.The     
 corner pillars can still be found.Ex-

 pleasure gardens off Mill Street were 
 laid out.St John's church and school  
 were built in 1843. The school clock  
 spire was replaced by the present     
 clock tower in 1910.The building at   
 the corner of Mill Street and Brighton
 Road,Redhill was built in 1817 as a   
 coaching inn and named the Summers    
 Arms.Later it was used as the vicarage
 for St John's church and is currently 
 flatted.The Market Laurie Day Centre  
 in Church Road South Park was used for
