		<content> Most of the farms in Bawdeswell are   
 farmed by one man on behalf of a      
 Norfolk family who have lived in the  
 county for many generations. Recently 
 the cropping has altered and they now 
 include wheat, barley, oats, kale and 
 sugar beet with field beans on the one
 small farm still owner occupied.      
 On the larger unit, which extends to a
 neighbouring parish, a computer has   
 recently been installed to monitor the
 success of crops, record the yields   
 and progress of the dairy herd and    
 followers, handle the wages and other 
 farm records. The buildings, a        
 collection of old and new, are almost 
 all used for agricultural purposes,   
 only a few cottages are let for       
 holiday use. Shooting &amp; fishing is for
 the owners only.                      
 Wildlife abounds in the scattered     
 woods which are not farmed.           </content>
