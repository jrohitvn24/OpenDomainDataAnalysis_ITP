		<content>The greater part of the whole area is  
devoted to {ARABLE FARMING.}   During  
1985 the main crops grown were:        
{WHEAT, BARLEY, , OIL SEED RAPE}       
 Most farms are large (500 acres+)     
and fields are also large (over 10     
acres).  There is often controversy    
over the fact that hedgerows are often 
destroyed.                             
Wheat was selling at about #100 per    
tonne and yields of 4 tonnes per acre  
were obtained. (1985)                  
The growing of oil seed rape is a      
recent introduction (last 5-6 years)   
and although the sight of huge yellow  
bands of colour is appealing, many     
folk consider that the fragrance       
causes headaches.
