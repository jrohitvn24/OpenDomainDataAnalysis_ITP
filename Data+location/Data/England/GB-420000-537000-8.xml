		<title>08A TENANT FARMER</title>
		<content> Mr.Mclarens family have worked here   
 for 119 years, but the owners live in 
 America.                              
 There are 1150 acres of land. The road
 at the edge of his farm is known      
 locally as "Dairy Lane" because there 
 once an old dairy at the roadside. He 
 keeps 600 sheep,50 cows; grows wheat, 
 corn and peas which he sells to       
 Batchelors. Spring barley makes beer, 
 and most profit comes from wheat.He   
 once kept pigs but did not like the   
 smell! There are only 5 workers on the
 farm and he relies a lot on machinery 
 which he sometimes hires as it is     
 cheaper than buying it. Wild animals  
 such as ducks, rabbits,pheasants are  
 found on the farm. There are 4 silos  
 to store grain and he grows about 2000
 tons a year.
