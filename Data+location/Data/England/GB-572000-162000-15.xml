		<content> We expected to see{concrete runways   
 but it was all grass and the cost of  
 Â£1m.to change them would be too much. 
 There were new{landing lights}which   
 change colour as the plane gets lower 
 so the pilot knows when he is at the  
 right angle to land.                  
 The largest modern aeroplane we saw   
 was an eight seater{Aztec,}the most   
 common was the two seater{Robin}which 
 cruises at 120mph.{Headcorn Flying    
{School}use them a lot here and lessons
 cost Â£15 for 30mins. Our Domesday     
 group  wanted to buy a{1960,Piper}on  
 sale for Â£10000! There are 300        
{movements}a day at the airport &lt;that  
 is a take off or a landing> or 100,000
 per year,that is a lot for a small    
 airport. There were only a few people 
{employed}there,the airport manager,   
 2 aircontrollers,1 apprentice and     
 about 4 engineers.                    </content>
