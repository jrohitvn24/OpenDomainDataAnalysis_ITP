		<title>11CHURCH CLOCK &amp; STONE KNIGHT</title>
		<content>{Church clock}                         
 On the level below the bells is the   
 clock, it is in a large pantry_like   
 cupboard and has two weights, one on  
 the left of the room and one on the   
 right. You can wind the clock up by   
 opening the cupboard and using a sort 
 of crank to wind the weights, the     
 weight on the left is to keep the     
 clock going and the one on the right  
 is to ring the bell on the hour.      
                                       
{The stone knight}                     
 In the church is a stone statue of a  
 knight in armour. He is pictured with 
 his legs resting on his dog, this is  
 to show that he died at home. He      
 probably died when the first church   
 was built, in about 1320 and someone  
 made a statue of him and put it in the
 church. But his name is still unknown.
