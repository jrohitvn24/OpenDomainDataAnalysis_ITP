		<content>        FORD PARISH CHURCH             
   Known as the church of St.Michael's 
 and All Angels,it is an ancient       
 structure dating from the 13th        
 century.The building is now in a sound
 condition,for this year has seen the  
 replacement of the existing tile roof 
 over the nave by a slate one.The work 
 was carried out by a local builder at 
 a cost of about Â£20,000.              
   The present incumbent is a          
 non-stipendiary priest,being the only 
 one in the Norham Deanery and this    
 year he is to have the help of a      
 non-stipendiary deacon.               
   The congregation averages 25 and the
 main money raising function is a fete 
 held in the grounds of the adjacent   
 castle.This raises about Â£1,000 and   
 together with covenants and free-will 
 offerings meets the costs of the      
 churches upkeep.                      </content>
