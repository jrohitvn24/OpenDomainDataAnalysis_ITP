		<content>    On Monday 15th July we went to     
 visit{Osborne House.} We left school  
 at 10.40 and after a 15 minute walk we
 arrived at the gate to the House.   We
 asked the security guard for Mr       
 Underwood and were directed to the    
 main House.  We soon found the        
 reception desk and after a little wait
 he arrived and showed us the way to   
 the Education Room.  This is were we  
 started to ask our questions:
