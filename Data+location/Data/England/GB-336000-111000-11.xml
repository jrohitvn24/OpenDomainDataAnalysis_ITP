		<title>11Buildings in Dowlish Wake.</title>
		<content> Dowlish Wake is a small village with  
 several interesting domestic          
 buildings.                            
 The Manor House, parts of which       
 probably date from the 16th C, stands 
 on the hill close to the church. The  
 internal and external details are     
 very fine . Its smoke blackened roof  
 has windbraces, a dentillated cornice 
 plate and pendants. The internal      
 details include framed ceilings and   
 hamstone fireplaces. The external     
 decorative details and window mullions
 are also of ham stone. The roof is    
 thatched.                             
 The Old Parsonage is only a fragment  
 of a much larger 16th C house.        
 Higher Farm, a very tall house with a 
 fine cut ham stone front, and mullion 
 windows. It has a very unusual double 
 stair, and good timber partitions.
