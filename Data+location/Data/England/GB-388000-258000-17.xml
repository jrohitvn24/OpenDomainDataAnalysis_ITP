		<title>17POPULATION CHANGES,ODDINGLEY</title>
		<content>     The population of{Oddingley       
 continued to fall until after the     
 Second World War, but the motor car   
 has made it a more accessible area    
 again. In 1951 the population in {    
{Martin Hussingtree}rose again.This was
 due to new housing developments in the
 area.In the years following this the  
 population fell again. Therefore      
 people must have preferred city life  
 as it was more convenient e.g. for    
 gas, electricity and transport        
 reasons.                              
        The population in the other    
 parts of our area are too small and   
 inconsistent to be recorded           
 e.g.{Brownheath}which has a population
 only just rising into double figures.
