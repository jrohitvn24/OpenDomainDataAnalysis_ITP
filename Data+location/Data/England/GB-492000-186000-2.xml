 The houses in our area are mainly     
 large and detached.In them they have  
 about four or five bedrooms,a         
 study,two bathrooms,a big living and  
 dining room,a big                     
 kitchen,hall,playroom and a double    
 garage.                               
 The average cost of a house in the    
 area is about Â£130 000.               
 A lot of these houses are quite old   
 and there are not many modern         
 ones.There is also no housing estates 
 and so there are not many houses.     
 There are thirty-seven detached       
 houses,two bungalows,twelve           
 farms,a hall,a church,a cottage and   
 three pubs.There are a few reasons why
 there are not many houses in the area 
 one being that all the houses seemed  
 to have very large gardens.
