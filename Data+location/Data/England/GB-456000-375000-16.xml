		<content>     Since the Second World War many   
 people who previously worked on the   
 Welbeck Estate have moved away to find
 better paid jobs in the region.       
 Because of this trend Welbeck has     
 declined over the years.              
     As well as a drop in population on
 the Estate there has also been a wane 
 in the amount of wildlife. Once there 
 was a lot of pheasant and other       
 wildlife throughout the Estate but    
 this is now tending to concentrate in 
 certain areas.                        
     The Welbeck Estates Co. runs the

 workforce of;
