		<title>11INDUSTRY in CHAPMORE END</title>
		<content>Horseman's Joinery was established in  
1972 on land which was formerly brick  
works utilizing the local clay. They   
make products from wood especially     
furniture and window frames which are  
sold to building firms. Contracts for  
work are received from many firms in   
London but more of their products are  
sold in shops. Occasionally they take  
orders and specially design and build  
the equipment needed.                  
Most of the wood used is imported from 
Scandinavia and the Far East and comes 
to the joinery via the docks by lorry. 
Roughly 45 people are employed mostly  
local, living within 12 miles of       
Chapmore End.                          
In nearby Tonwell is another small     
joinery which concentrates on          
producing fencing and palettes. They   
employ six people. Lorries stacked     
with these palettes are a common sight.</content>
