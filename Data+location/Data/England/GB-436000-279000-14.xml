		<title>14CRIME IN WALSGRAVE</title>
		<content> The most common crime around our area 
 is stealing,e.g.from shops or houses. 
 The most popular age for crime is     
 between 16 and 18.                    
 There are many gangs going round my   
 area,the most popular areas being Bell
 Green and Stoke Heath.These gangs have
 a lot to do with stealing in our area 
 and they cause a lot of damage when   
 they fight.                           
 The different sorts of gangs are Punk 
 Rockers,Skinheads,Mods,Trendies and   
 Heavy Metal gangs.These gangs often   
 fight among themselves.They also      
 frighten old people and vandalise     
 property.                             
 Another common crime is vandalism when
 people get their windows smashed,walls
 are written on,kicked down,trees are  
 pulled etc.The rate payer  has to     
 foot the bill for this kind of damage.
 Vandalism usually takes place at night</content>
