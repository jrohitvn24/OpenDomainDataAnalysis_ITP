		<title>20CRANHAM POPULATION</title>
		<content> About a quarter of the population of  
 Cranham are of pensionable age , a few
 of whom retired to the village , but  
 most moved to the village during their
 working life and then stayed on.      
 Most of the working age population    
 have moved into the village since the 
 1950s when electricity reached the    
 area and houses began to be purchased 
 by outsiders. the majority of people  
 work in Gloucester or Cheltenham with 
 a few in Stroud or Cirencester. Most  
 are in middle management and jobs     
 range from Taxation to Customs and    
 Excise, from Foreign Office and       
 Government Communications to pollution
 control for Severn Trent Water        
 Authority and fron salesmen to        
 clerical workers.                     
 All join in the many social activities
 arranged in the village mainly by     
 Village Hall or Friends of the School.</content>
