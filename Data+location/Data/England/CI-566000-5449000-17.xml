		<title>17GRANDS VAUX WATER MILLS</title>
		<content>   Grands Vaux, which means big        
 streams, was one of the most important
 streams of Jersey. Over the years at  
 least ten water mills have been sited 
 along the valley and eight of these   
 are known to have been working at     
 one time.                             
  These mills are first recorded in the
 the 13th century. Rebuilt of local    
 stone in the 17th century, their      
 millstones came from either France    
 or Derbyshire.                        
  Most of the moving parts including   
 gears, were made of wood. Most of the 
 mills had a set of millstones for     
 grinding wheat to make a fine white   
 flour and a set for grinding oats for 
 cattle feed.                          
  Most of the mills have either been   
 knocked down or burnt down and all but
 one have not been used since before   
 World War 2.                          </content>
