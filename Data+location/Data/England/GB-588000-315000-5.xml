		<title>05    HOUSING IN LITCHAM</title>
		<content> Many of the older houses in this area 
are built of flint.This is because     
flint is found in abundance around     
here.There are 2 different methods of  
building with flint.They are knaped    
and unknaped.The knaped flint has      
it's edges cut off neatly in a square  
shape,the unknaped flint is just flint 
from the ground.                       
   The biggest flint building in       
Litcham is the church built in the     
C16.The next biggest building is the   
priory which is now a cafe,built in    
C15.As well as houses having walls,they
need roofs.Some houses in Litcham have 
slate roofs but the majority have red  
pan tiles because they are cheaper than
slate.
