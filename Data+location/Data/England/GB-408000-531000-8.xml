		<title>08FARMING IN HAMSTERLEY</title>
		<content> Farming in the area is the major      
 occupation,even though they are family
 units run with occasional help.The    
 average farm is about 230 acres,is low
 intensive grassland,supporting mainly 
 sheep.Owner occupation and tenancy are
 about equal.There has been a complete 
 move from dairying since the          
 introduction of E.E.C. regulations.A  
 small number of beef cattle are       
 reared.Grain and root crops occupy a  
 very small proportion of land.Silage  
 and hay are the main crops,to feed the
 stock through the winter.             
   Areas of rough grazing are being    
 drained and reclaimed for more        
 intensive grazing.The moorland areas  
 are common land which are utilised as 
 pasture by local farmers.There is also
 an intensive pig farm,which supplies  
 slurry to local farms.A new venture is
 a herd of milking Friesland sheep.    </content>
