		<title>16FLOWERS OF DOWNS AND WEALD</title>
		<content> Throughout the year there are many    
 different species of wild flower in   
 this block. This account refers mostly
 to plants in flower in July. One of   
 the most interesting families is the  
 Orchids as they are quite rare in     
 Britain. Most are an attractive light 
 shade of lilac and deep purple in     
 places, but do not smell as nice as   
 they look. Older people say there are 
 many more flowers when they were      
 young. Their numbers dropped when     
 farmers began to use chemical sprays. 
 Now many are slowly coming back.
