		<title>12Richard's Day.</title>
		<content> Most days I get up at 7.30 and I wash,
 clean my teeth and dress before going 
 downstairs to have a breakfast of     
 cornflakes and a piece of toast with  
 jam.I look after my two brothers until
 8.00 when I make my sandwiches for    
 lunch.I watch television until I go to
 school by car.School starts at 8.50   
 with registration and then assembly.I 
 work at various subjects until morning
 break at 10.45 when I play football   
 with my friends.From 11.00 to 12.00 I 
 do more work and then we have time for
 quiet reading.Our lunchtime lasts from
 12.15 to 1.30 and we eat in the main  
 hall.We have other activities in the  
 afternoon and school finishes at 3.15.
 After school I ride on my bicycle or  
 play in the field.Then I go to Cubs   
 where we play games,like taking keys  
 silently from a blind-folded person.I 
 read until 8.30 when I go to bed.     </content>
