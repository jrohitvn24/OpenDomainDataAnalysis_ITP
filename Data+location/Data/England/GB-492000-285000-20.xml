		<content> 100 years ago most people worked in   
 the village or on the farms around.   
 They included stonemasons, sawyers,   
 smiths, tanners, shopkeepers etc.     
 Today, most people find employment out
 of the village either in Corby or     
 Kettering. Up until 1980 scores of men
 in the village were employed by       
{British Steel}at Corby, now only a    
 handful still have jobs there. The    
 chief source of employment in the     
 village is{Spencers Woodyard.}The     
{Wallis and Linnells building}is no    
 longer a clothing factory but houses a
 firm of chartered architects. This    
 factory was built in 1872 at a cost of
 Â£1,334 2s. 7d. The factory closed on  
 23rd November 1979.
