		<title>12Thornton village</title>
		<content> Thornton is set on a hill. It lies    
 between Bell Dean and Pinch Beck      
 valleys. It is surrounded by          
 countryside but in the centre of      
 Thornton it is usually very busy. On  
 Market Street there is a house where  
 the Brontes were born. We have a      
 viaduct and from Hill Top there is a  
 good view of it. There used to be a   
 train track on there but it is no     
 longer in use. A lot of the streets   
 are still cobbled and you are always  
 having to walk up hills. There are 3  
 schools in Thornton, 2 first schools  
 and a middle school. The middle school
 site used to be a railway station but 
 then they turned it into a school.A   
 lot of the houses are old but parts of
 Thornton are very new. Near St James' 
 church there are some council houses  
 that were built just after the second 
 world war.                            </content>
