		<title>10BRADSHAWS TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Bradshaws was founded in 1885 by John 
 Bradshaw of Sturton by Stow.At first  
 they all were Agricultural contractors
 and used to hire out,machines to help 
 farmers.During the 2nd World War      
 Bradshaws helped to build some of the 
 local R.A.F.aerodromes.In 1948 the    
 government nationalised all the large 
 transport companies.Bradshaws was too 
 small to be included.The small compan 
 y was based at Sturton-by-Stow.Later  
 as it grew they built a depot in      
 Gainsborough.Then they took over a    
 firm called Wiles Transport on Church 
 St.In 1961 they built a new depot in  
 Willoughby st.They carry all sorts of 
 goods ranging from oil to grain and   
 general haulage.There are about 50    
 lorries and 60 people at Bradshaws.
