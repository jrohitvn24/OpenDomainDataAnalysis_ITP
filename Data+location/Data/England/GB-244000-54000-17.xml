		<content> There are a lot of different fashions 
 that are popular at the moment.       
 Probably the most unusual is the punk 
 style. Some punks dress that way just 
 because they like the clothes or      
 because they like particular pop      
 groups that dress that way. Others    
 belong to gangs and frighten people.  
 There are some punks that hang out at 
 the railway station and on street     
 corners. They wear leather and chains,
 knuckle dusters, weird hairstyles with
 different colours, poison signs on    
 their jackets and initials (e.g.:GBH -
 'Grievious Bodily Harm'). Some are    
 very nice people but others are       
 vandals that swear and smash litter   
 bins and park benches. They use pen,  
 pencil, crayon, paint and spray paint 
 to infest our walls with graffitti.   
 Most punks are teenagers. Some are at 
 school, some work,some are unemployed.</content>
