		<content>     It was to the church that the     
 Villagers fled for safety whenever    
 there was trouble or an uprising.The  
 main Church door is very strong, and  
 was formerly secured by a strong      
 timber pole.The recesses for this pole
 can be seen on either side of the     
 door.                                 
     In the early church there were no 
 pews and the Nave would be used as the
 Village Hall for gatherings of all    
 kinds, including being the            
 "market-place" where produce from the 
 land would be bartered or sold.       
     The boards on the wall of the     
 Cresacre Chapel give the details of   
 various charities administered by the 
 Church.Although today the sums of     
 money seem very small, in the 18th and
 19th centuries they would represent   
 very substantial amounts.
