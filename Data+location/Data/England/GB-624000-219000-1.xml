 has doubled over the last fifty years,
 most of this as a result of the urban 
 expansion which has occured in the    
 last twenty years.  The population    
 increases dramatically during the     
 summer months due to an influx of     
 holidaymakers and day-tripping        
 tourists who stay in the wide         
 variety of holiday accommodation      
 available.                            
                                       
 There is an imbalanced age structure  
 in the area.  There is a large section
 of the population who are of          
 retirement age, and, therefore        
 correspondingly fewer numbers in other
 sections of the community, which      
 creates a number of effects on other  
 aspects of the society.
