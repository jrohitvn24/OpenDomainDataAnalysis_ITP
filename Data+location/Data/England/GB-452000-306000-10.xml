 On Wednesdays I get up and have my    
 cereal. Then I walk to school at      
  .35am and arrive at 8.45am. Then I go
  nto assembly. After that I go        
 swimming in the school swimming pool. 
 At half past ten I go to play for 15  
 minutes.                              
                                       
 When we come in I do Maths or         
 English or Topic work. At 12 o'clock  
 we go for our dinner in the hall. I   
 bring sandwiches to eat. After eating 
 we play games like Tig and Hide and   
 Seek outside in the playground. At    
 1.15 we go inside and do more work.   
                                       
 When 3.15 comes we go home. Then I    
 play with my friends. I go to bed at  
 9.00pm. after having a drink of tea,  
 coffee or milk.
