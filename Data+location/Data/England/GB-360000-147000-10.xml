		<content> People in our villages need cars to   
 enable them to go to work and often a 
 second car is needed by families for  
 the shopping and the needs of the     
 children. Public transport is poor    
 with only one bus service in Binegar  
 and one in Oakhill. From Binegar one  
 can only reach Wells or Bath and not  
 the nearest town of Shepton Mallet,   
 while the people of Oakhill can only  
 travel to Shepton Mallet and Bath.    
 Neither village has any link with     
 Bristol. The council provide transport
 for older children to reach their     
 secondary school in the nearest town. 
 However, most of the junior children  
 have to make their own way to school  
 and as their routes are up to 2 miles 
 long, often along busy main roads with
 no pavements, parents rely heavily on 
 each other for transport or escorting 
 children.                             </content>
