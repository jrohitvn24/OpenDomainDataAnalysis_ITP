		<content>  The MARN'LL BOOK gives a unique      
 picture of life in the Blackmore Vale.

 collected by Marnhull Women's         
 Institute to commemorate the Festival 
 of Britain 1951.A copy was presented  
 to Queen Elizabeth the Second at      
 Gillingham in 1952.

 its geographical and historical       
 setting and provides much detail on   
 such things as the churches,schools,  
 local buildings,clubs,societies,field 
 and place names,industries,customs and
 superstitions.
