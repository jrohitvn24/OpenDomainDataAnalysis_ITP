		<title>16PICK YOUR OWN</title>
		<content>  In recent years the cult of{Pick your
{Own}has grown considerably and in our 
 block some of the fruit growers went  
 over to this system, starting in 1964.
 Twenty-five acres are now utilsed in  
 this way with{Strawberries,Raspberries
{Blackcurrants,Gooseberries,Apples and 
{Pears}being grown.                    
  Rather than paying people to pick the
 crop, customers pick their own and pay
 for the quantity picked. In this way  
 people can otain a large quantity of  
 produce, selecting both size, variety 
 and ripeness to suit individual taste.
  On a smaller scale there is one      
 grower also inviting customers to pick
 their own{salad crops and vegetables. 
  However, although still very popular 
 the Pick your Own seems to have       
 reached a peak and demand is now      
 decreasing.It is not possible to say  
 how many people use this facility.    </content>
