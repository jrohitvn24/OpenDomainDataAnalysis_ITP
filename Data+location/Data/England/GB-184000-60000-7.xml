		<content> The landscape is mostly grass with    
 some ceareals such as barley and      
 wheat. The land at the {FIR HILL is   
 very hilly with a lot of country lanes
 and tracks,mostly made of rubble and  
 over grown with trees. In the Fir Hill
 there are many derelict buildings as  
 it used to be a mining settlement. The
 land is covered with trees and grass. 
 The trees lean over the road and      
 include pines, ash, sycamore, chestnut
 and hazel.  There were quite a few    
 hedgerows which have been left        
 overgrown. In the wood there are lots 
 of small tracks. On one of these there
 is a small car dump. The area at {    
{COLAN WOODS} is very shaded. Along the
 side of the footpath there is a little
 marshy ground and a small stream      
 running through into PORTH RESERVOIR.
