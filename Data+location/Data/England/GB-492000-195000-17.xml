		<content> We visited Second Wood Farm  because  
 it is owned by the parents of Simon   
 Cook from our class.It has 557 acres  
 of land,and about 100 acres is wood-  
 land.There are 40 cows which are a    
 mixture including Friesian, Hereford, 
 Aberdeen Angus,and Charolais,and a    
 four year old Blond Aquitaine bull    
 weighing about 3 tons.The calves are  
 all cross breeds,and are kept for a   
 year before being sold.They also grow 
 crops;wheat for animal feed and flour;
 barley for feed and malting;oats for  
 feeding and porridge;peas to be pro-  
 cessed;linseed for oil or margarine   
 and triticale.                        
 Mrs Cook explained the farmer's year  
 and all the machinery they need to use
 like harrows,ploughs,seed drills,     
 fertiliser spreader,sprayers,tractors,
 a combine harvester and an assortment 
 of trailers.                          </content>
