		<title>19A DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> y sister and I set out for school at  
ten to nine. We go to school by car. At
school I meet my friends then we line  
up for the bell. In my class the       
teacher takes the register then the    
secretary takes the dinner register. I 
stay sandwiches.  We line up with our  
hymn books and go into assembly. After 
assembly we sometimes have a class     
lesson or we are split into groups.The 
bell goes for playtime at 10.30. I play
with my friends.                       
After play we work in our groups unless
we have P.E. or games.If it is sunny we
do games outside. At 12.00 we have     
dinner. We go back at 1.00.            
We sometimes have Reading 360 in which 
we read a story and then do work about 
it, or we might do Maths.Sometimes we  
have Art. On Wednesdays we have        
singing.We have another playtime at    
2.15 and go home at 3.30.              </content>
