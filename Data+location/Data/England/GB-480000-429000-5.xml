 I retired in February 1977 at the age 
 of sixty five years after a full      
 working life of fifty one years, of   
 which thirty three years were spent in
 the Hull Fire Brigade. When I retired 
 I wondered how I would settle down to 
 a more stereotyped and tranquil sort  
 of life but I was determined not to   
 become chair bound. Just previous to  
 retiring I moved from Hull to         
 Gilberdyke and here I found scope for 
 a more varied sort of life.           
                                       
 By becoming a Parish Councillor and a 
 School Governor new horizons were     
 opened out for me. Today I could be   
 involved in meeting Community         
 Improvement representatives regarding 
 improving amenities in the village,
