		<title>10UNTREATED MILK IN WEST YORKS</title>
		<content>   The popularity of raw untreated     
 'green top' milk is falling because of
 periodic health scares. Six milion    
 gallons of milk is produced each day  
 in England and Wales. Three million   
 gallons ends up bottled for domesstic 
 use, but of that only 1% is green top.
   However, our area is unusuual in    
 that a survey of pupils in school     
 showed that over half still have the  
 untreated milk. This may not be the   
 case for much longer. Much publicity  
 has been given to the health risks and
 there are moves to ban the milk.      
   Local milk producers are fighting   
 these moves. They claim that green top
 milk is fresh milk which is better for
 us because pasteurisation (heat       
 treatment) to kill bacteria, also     
 reduces the nutritional value. Despite
 their efforts the days of untreated   
 milk seem numbered.                   </content>
