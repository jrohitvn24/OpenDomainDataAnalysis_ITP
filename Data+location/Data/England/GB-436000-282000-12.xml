		<content> The area has many links with coal     
 mining. An old wooden post erected    
 along Deedmore Road is a former gate  
 post of the railway link between the  
 Coventry canal and the Alexander coal 
 mine. The mine is now closed and much 
 of the surrounding land is reclaimed. 
 A farm is situated on the site of the 
 former mine. The playing fields of    
 Eburne school are grassed slag heaps  
 and a bridle path is a reclaimed      
 distributory canal trench. This lies  
 behind Eburne school. In the          
 school hall one can see a collage     
 mural depicting the area in 1880. This
 was made by the parents. The area has 
 no remaining contact with the mining  
 industry and many adults living in the
 area are unemployed. 26% of all       
 tenants housed in Wood End have no    
 job.
