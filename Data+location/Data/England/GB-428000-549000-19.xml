		<content>{SPOT}A ball is kicked against the wall
 moving  further  away  from the target
 after  each try. Scoring  becomes more
 difficult.A miss earns a penalty - the
 letter S, two misses - P,three - O and
 four - T. After S.P.O.T. - you're out!
{TALLY HO!}   There are two teams - one
 must catch the other. If caught,you're
 put against the wall,but if your team-
 mate reaches the wall and shouts"Tally
 Ho!"the "captives" are free.          
{WOUNDED SOLDIERS} The players stand in
 a ring and pass a  ball around. If you
 drop the ball ,you "lose"a leg, arm or
 eye and you  aren't  allowed to use it
 again  until you catch the ball twice.
{RAIN,THUNDER,LIGHTNING.  }  One person
 calls  "Rain,thunder,lightning" and on
 the word  "lightning",  everybody does
 handstands.  Whoever  stays in the air
 the longest, calls next time.
