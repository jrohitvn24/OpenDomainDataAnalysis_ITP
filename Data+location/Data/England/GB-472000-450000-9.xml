		<title>09WILBERFOSS POST LADY</title>
		<content> The Wilberfoss post lady usually gets 
 up at 5.30am.Then she goes to the post
 office where she starts the round with
 the other post lady.The other post    
 lady does a larger portion of the     
 village post.Both of them do their    
 rounds on bicycles.  She enjoys her   
 work because she gets out in the fresh
 air and has the opportunity of meeting
 lots of people. She can also keep a   
 friendly eye on elderly people living 
 on their own. After her round she does
 not go back to bed, but she goes to   
 bed early at 10.00pm each evening. She
 has two weeks annual holiday each year
 during which time the other post lady 
 does all the rounds herself. After    
 her round is finished she often helps 
 out  in the village shop/post office. 
 She feels that the pay she receives   
 is good for the work that she does.
