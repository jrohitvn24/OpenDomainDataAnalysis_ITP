		<content> To the S.E.{WINGFIELD}is overshadowed 
 by the{WESTBURY HILLS}.The scarp slope
 rises to over 700ft..On a clear day   
 you can see the WHITE HORSE. Directly 
 in front of the hills is the tall     
 cement factory chimney belching smoke.
 On a windy day this shows clearly the 
 wind's direction . Our area has gentle
 hills and some woods. It is split into
{four sections}by two busy roads which 
 meet in the middle of {WINGFIELD}.    
 This junction is dangerous with poor  
 visibility on the Bradford side. In   
 the past 3 years 9 accidents have been
 reported but many others have occurred
 .The{PARISH COUNCIL}would like a      
 roundabout but the County Council will
 not agree.Presently heavy lorries (   
 over 3 tons ) turn towards{FROME}or {}
{BRADFORD}because the local authority  
 will not strengthen Farleigh Bridge.
