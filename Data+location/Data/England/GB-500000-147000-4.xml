		<content> Most of the farms are situated at the 
 foot of the chalk Downs. Most farms   
 raise either beef cattle or dairy     
 cattle. South Warren Farm, White Lane 
 Farm, Burwood Farm and Manor Farm all 
 raise beef cattle. Tyting Farm and    
 Hornhatch Farm raise dairy cattle.    
 Tyting Farm delivers milk and         
 Channel Island cream around the       
 Guildford area.                       
                                       
 Many of the farms also grow crops     
 which are mostly used as fodder, but  
 Warren Farm grows cereal crops.       
 Burwood Farm also rears thoroughbred  
 horses and they have a number of mares
 and foals. Great Halfpenny Farm is    
 unique in this area because it keeps  
 sheep on ten acres of land. Most of   
 the farmers employ a few farm hands to
 help with the general working of the  
 farms.                                </content>
