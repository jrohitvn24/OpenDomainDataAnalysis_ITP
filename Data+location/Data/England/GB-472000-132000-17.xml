		<title>17Apple Growing In Selborne</title>
		<content> There have been many changes in apple 
 growing and picking over the last     
 forty years.The trees fruit on two    
 year old wood and careful pruning is  
 essential.They start pruning in       
 November and finish in June.Now they  
 have started using a spray which      
 restricts the growth so less pruning  
 is needed.April to May is when the    
 blossoms form.In July the apples Katie
 Discovery and Grenadier are picked.In 
 September,the Cox,Bramley,Ida Red,    
 Golden Delicious,Spartan and Russets  
 are ready.Apples cover 300 acres.Every
 apple picking season 100 extra people 
 are hired.Trees used to grow up to 10 
 metres high.Very big and costly       
 ladders were needed for pickers.Now   
 they don't grow more than 2 metres.The
 average amount of apples grown each   
 year is about 100,000 bushels.New     
 varieties are always being discovered!</content>
