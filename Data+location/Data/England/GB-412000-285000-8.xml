		<content>When I got up on Sunday I had breakfast
and then my dad took me to my nan for  
the day.We arrived about 11:00a.m.My   
uncle was there and I had not seen him 
for about six months.It was great to   
see him.He and my dad went for a drink 
and when they came back from the pub we
had dinner.My nan had to cook for eight
because my cousins were there as well  
and my nan does not like people sitting
there,not eating.We did not finish     
dinner until about 3:30 p.m. and then I
helped my nan wash up.She was very     
grateul.A 4:30 we sat down and had a   
cup of tea and watched television for  
3 hours.We had our tea at 7:30.We had  
sandwiches,cake and a drink.About 9:30 
my dad and I left.We caught the bus    
home quite quickly and got in about    
10:00.I had a bath,watched television  
until about 11:00 and went to bed.
