		<title>15WHAT WE DO IN OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>                                       
People go to  School  to learn  things.
At School we don't just work.   We play
games and do music, art and craft.     
We have play-time also.   Sometimes, if
we are naughty, we have  to stay  in at
play-time.                             
At our school, we  arrive  between 8.50
and 9.00 a.m.   School  starts  at 9.00
and finishes at 3.30 p.m.              
At the end of the  third  year, when we
come back to school  after  the  Summer
holiday, we go into Mr. Wills' class.  
Mrs. Melhuish teaches the first, second
and third years  and Mr. Wills  teaches
the fourth and fifth years.            
Mrs. Griffies comes to teach the fourth
and fifth years on Wednesday and Friday
mornings.
