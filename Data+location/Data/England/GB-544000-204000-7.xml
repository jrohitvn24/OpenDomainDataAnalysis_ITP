		<title>07RYE HILL WATER TOWER</title>
		<content> The water tower is located on the very
 top of Rye Hill.It is an important    
 landmark visible for miles around.    
 The water comes mostly from boreholes 
 into the chalk rock beneath Harlow and
 needs little treatment.               
 When full,the tower holds 2.25 million
 litres,fed to Harlow by gravity       
 through underground mains.            
 The tower is one of many owned by the 
 Lea Valley Water Corporation and is   
 the main source of domestic tap water 
 throughout Harlow.As each person uses 
 about 180 litres of water a day,the   
 supply is very important.The waste    
 water must be treated,and Harlow's    
 water goes to Stanstead Abbotts for   
 treatment before being returned to the
 River Lea.
