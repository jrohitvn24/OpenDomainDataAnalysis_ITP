		<title>20LEISURE ACTIVITIES IN TOTTON</title>
		<content> We walked around part of Totton to    
 find out what people do in their spare
 time and where they go. A lot of      
 people went to Southampton. They all  
 said that the facilities for young    
 people in Totton are very poor. But   
 there are a few things like youth     
 clubs. Several people go to pubs like 
 the Old Farm House. The older people  
 go to the Three Score Club or the     
 Over Sixties Club.
