   This area is situated at the edge of
 the foothills of the{Pennines}and     
 overlooks{Wigan}in the{River Douglas  
{valley.}                              
  {Agriculture}dominates this area,    
 mostly dairy and stock farming, with  
 crops being grown mainly for feeding  
 the livestock.                        
   Until the Inter-War Depression,     
 industries were established around the
 main village of{Aspull,}including{malt
{kilns, cotton mills and coal mines,}  
 the latter leaving many examples of   
 its working life. The last working pit
 closed in the 1920's.                 
   One of the pleasant sights within   
 and around the village is the presence
 of large parcels of{common land.}
