      Although the Slimbridge Wildfowl 
 Trust is just outside the area        
 surveyed it is of great importance to 
 the locality.  As one of              
 Gloucestershire's major tourist       
 attractions the Trust brings many     
 people through the villages of        
 Slimbridge and Cambridge each year and
 provides employment and revenue for   
 many inhabitants of the villages - as 
 well as causing occasional traffic    
 problems!                             
      The many species of bird visiting
 the Trust can often be seen closer to 
 the villages and include Canada Geese,
 Snow Geese, Pink-footed Geese, Purple 
 Sandpipers, Sandwich Terns, Redwings  
 and Peregrine Falcons.  However, the  
 best facilities for viewing these and 
 other birds are to be found at the    
 Trust.                                </content>
