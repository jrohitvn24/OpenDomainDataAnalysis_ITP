 the early 16th century.On the west    
 side of the church there is a wooden

 bishop's chair where important        
 visitors sit.On the west side of the

 stone dates back to the 18th century. 
 Behind the church there are newer     
 graves and now they use the field next
 to the church as a graveyard.{
