		<content>     There are three local newspapers  
 in the Preston area - The Lancashire  
 Evening Post, The Citizen and The     
 Leader. The Post costs 16p whereas the
 other two are free. Between June 3rd  
 and June 8th 1985 the following       
 events took place in the Preston area:
 a row about leadership of Lancashire  
 County Council, a dispute between     
 local publicans over licensing hours  
 and the construction of a new Â£16m    
 shopping centre. There were various   
 galas and festivals and also the Great
 Northwestern Half Marathon, and a fun-
 run in which 4,000 sponsored runners  
 raised money for a special cardiac    
 centre. Other events advertised       
 included 3 films at the Preston Odeon,
 various old time sequence dances,     
 discos and judo and ju-jitsu classes.
