		<title>13West Blatchington Windmill</title>
		<content>  West Blatchington Windmill built in  
 1724 was the focal point of the       
 countryside consisting of a few farm  
 buildings,trees,grass and a pond and  
 although the mill has changed very    
 little the surrounding area is now    
 mostly urban.                         
  The 3 storey wooden windmill,with its
 revolving cap, 4 sails and circular   
 windows is both a tower &amp; a smock mill
 built on a flint and brick barn. It   
 was used for grinding, powering the   
 chaff cutters &amp; also the threshing    
 machines and later on as a smugglers  
 store and was a well known landmark   
 for sailors.                          
  The windmill stopped work in 1907 and
 in1928 was bought by Hove Corporation,
 who,along with the National Trust have
 preserved the building since. The farm
 buildings and barn are no longer there
 and the mill is open for the public.  </content>
