		<title>04Domestic Shops in Thornton</title>
		<content>{Trade.}There is now only 1 small      
 supermarket which employs 5 people and
 is about 2000 sq.ft in size. Mr Walker
 has owned it for 31 years.            
{Customers.}Because this is a village  
 he knows most of his customers, many  
 of whom shop daily.Trade increases in 
 the Summer when tourists come.        
{Products.}These include bacon, butter 
 cereals, soap, ice-cream,confectionery
 and wine but no hardware. Most        
 successful sales are of peas and      
 peaches and salad ingredients in      
 Summer.                               
{Changes.}In 1984 a large supermarket  
 opened in Pickering.This has seriously
 damaged trade for the smaller shops   
 and has already led to the closure of 
 the village Co-Operative store.
