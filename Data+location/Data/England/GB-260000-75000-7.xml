 The Wisht Hounds - This story         
 originates from Wistmans Wood and has 
 many variations. It is said that they 
 are led by Dewer, the devil himself,  
 and are known to gallop around the    
 moor on dark nights. According to one 
 version they are supposed to be the   
 souls of young, unbaptised babies who 
 had died. Known as "chrisoms", they   
 now roam the moor hunting the devil   
 himself.                              
                                       
 According to tradition, anybody who   
 sees the hounds on a hunt will die    
 within one year, and anyone who       
 follows them will be lured to a nasty 
 end!                                  
                                       
 The hounds are reported to be jet     
 black, like the devil himself.        </content>
