		<title>18 RUGELEY TOWN CENTRE</title>
		<content>                                       
The centre of Rugeley has changed a    
lot over the last few years. Upper     
Brook Street, Market Square, Albion    
Street and Brewery Street are no       
longer used by vehicles. The centre    
has been pedestrianised. The old roads 
have been paved with bricks and this   
has made the shopping area much safer  
and more pleasant. The Old Market Hall 
has gone and a modern indoor Market    
Hall has been built near to the bus    
station, although a lot of people      
think there should be a market in      
Market Square.  One thing that spoils  
the new look of Rugeley is the litter  
which people drop everywhere.  There   
are litter bins but few people use     
them. The town centre could look very  
nice with it's red/blue brick paving,  
trees and flower beds.
