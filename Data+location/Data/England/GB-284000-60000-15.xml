		<title>15Beacon Kennels - Paignton</title>
		<content> The kennels are on Beacon Hill because
 it is very quiet and away from other  
 housing.The only animals that are     
 accepted are cats and  dogs. Some     
 people put their cats and dogs in     
 kennels because they are going away.  
 The pets have to have injections      
 before they come into the kennels so  
 that they do not spread diseases.     
 The maximum number of animals accepted
 in Beacon Kennels are 30 dogs and 20  
 cats. When we went we counted 21 dogs 
 and 17 cats. There were lots of       
 different kinds of dogs and cats.     
 There was one black cat that was 20   
 years old.                            
 The busiest times of the year are June
 and July. The cats and dogs are fed a 
 set menu chosen by the owners. At     
 6a.m. the owner would feed and stay   
 with the cats then at 7a.m. do the    
 same with the dogs.                   </content>
