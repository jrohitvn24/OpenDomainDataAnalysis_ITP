  On the day we visited St.Andrew's in 
 Kirkella we met the vicar The Reverand
 Canon J.C.H. Wilson M.A. ,Hon. C.F.   
  He had been showing a surveyor around
 the church. He explained to us some of
 the problems of trying to look after a
 building several hundred years old.In 
 particular the most urgent problem was
 the roof that was leaking and would   
 cost thousands of pounds to repair.   
    He also told some of the church's  
 history and how it had helped name the
 village. The original name had been   
 Elveley, a combination of two         
 Anglo-Saxon words : Ella meaning elf  
 friend and Ley meaning homestead. Kirk
 meaning church was added in the 14th  
 century.Kirk Elley gradually changed  
 to Kirkella by 1700.Now there is Kirk 
 Ella (correctly two words) and North, 
 East, West and South Ellas.           </content>
