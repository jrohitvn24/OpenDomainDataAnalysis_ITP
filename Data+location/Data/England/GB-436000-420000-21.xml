<title>21Changes in the CBD Area</title>

<content>



The Swimming Baths built in 1926 as a result of contributions from the Mining community was demolished and rebuilt in the same architectural style to become an outlet of the Danish supermarket chain Netto. This in turn has become part of the Wal-Mart chain now trading as ASDA. The influence of the Vikings continues.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Baptist Chapel opposite had a fire as a result of an electrical fault, it is still in a state of disrepair.&lt;br />&lt;br />Where once Railway tracks and locomotives were manufactured, the Forge area, now stands a Lidl supermarket, a Germanic influence. Nearly all of the Butchers shops have disappeared replaced by charity shops and hairdressers.   &lt;br />
