		<title>19EMPLOYMENT IN HARNHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
   Employment in Harnham is restricted.
 There are few industries involving    
 many employees. Most of the local     
 employment bases are small, such as   
 village shops,pubs,schools, etc. There
 are 6 farms in and around Harnham, but
 dueto high_tech modern machinery,     
 farmers require few to work the farm. 
 The three garages in Harnham also only
 employ few _ 3 of them being          
 self_service for petrol. The main     
 sources of employment  are the 3      
 hospitals. There is a general         
 hospital, one for the elderly, and a  
 research unit studying the common     
 cold.The sewage works and a small     
 printing workshop complete the        
 employment opportunities in Harnham.
