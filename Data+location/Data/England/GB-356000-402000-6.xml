		<title>06Houses and Buildings in Ince</title>
		<content>In Lower Ince many buildings have been 
demolished. Most of the houses that are
left are old and neglected. Vandals    
often break into the empty houses and  
start fires. However the council is now
building some new homes for old people.
It is also planting flowers and trees  
around the houses to help make the area
more pleasant for the residents. Near  
to the reclaimed site of the old Lower 
Ince Railway Station there is a small  
grassy play-ground but someone has bro-
ken the swings and the rocking horse.  
Only the climbing frame and slide are  
now left. Even the trees have been     
vandalised. One of the more attractive 
buildings in Ince is the former Town   
Hall. It is typically Edwardian, built 
in 1903 in the Romanesque style with   
red brick and lots of ornate terra-    
cotta decoration. The Town Hall is now 
a District Office for Wigan Metro.     </content>
