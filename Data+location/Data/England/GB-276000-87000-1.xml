		<content> Located in the{Dartmoor National Park}
 between Dunsford and Moretonhampstead,
 this is a rural area of a mixture of  
 moorland, farm and woodlands dominated
 by the steep sided wooded{Teign valley
{gorge}of the upper reaches of the     
 River Teign. A main road, the{B3212,  
 passes through the southeast corner of
 the block and is heavily used,        
 particularly in summer by tourist     
 traffic visiting the Dartmoor         
 National Park or travellers to        
 Cornwall avoiding the bottle necks on 
 the A30 to Cornwall.  There is a      
 nature trail going up the river valley
 and a{National Trust}area, mainly     
 wooded on either side of the main     
 road. One of the prominent features   
 is{Heltor Rock}located in the         
 southeast area. There are four mixed  
 farms, an ancient{cairn circle}and    
{Wooston Castle Iron Age}fort remains. </content>
