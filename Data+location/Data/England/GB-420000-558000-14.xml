		<content> The farms which once served           
 Ravensworth Estate have changed in    
 character since their sale in l965.   
 Generally the soils have been         
 disturbed by (large scale) open cast  
 mining. They form an open "green      
 belt" on the S-West extremity of the  
 Tyne-Wear conurbation. Farming is     
 mixed, but highly specialised, the    
 largest farm, Trench Hall, breeds     
 French and Swiss cattle for live      
 sale at home and abroad.  It          
 occupies 420 acres of arable land     
 between 55-85m growing barley, wheat  
 and potatoes (under contract to a     
 local crisp factory), and ley grass.  
  In l985 oil seed rape was            
 cultivated encouraged by the high     
 financial returns afforded under the  
 EEC's CAP.s
