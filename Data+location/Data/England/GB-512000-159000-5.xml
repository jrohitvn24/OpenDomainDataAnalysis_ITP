		<content> Oxhott Heath is a large public open   
 space. It consists of various trees   
 especially Scots pines and oaks with  
 other ground cover plants. There is a 
 sandy pit which is slightly marshy at 
 the bottom.                           
 People exercise their dogs there and  
 go for family walks.                  
 On the top of a hill, there is a{war  
{memorial}to the local people who died 
 in the First and Second World Wars.   
 There are also benches as memorials   
 for people with a plaque with their   
 name engraved on it.                  
 Lower down the hill there is heather  
 growing, parts being fenced off so    
 that where it has died it can regrow  
 without being walked on.
