		<title>04CHEBSEY</title>
		<content> Chebsey is a quiet hamlet, tucked away
 from main road traffic, and dominated 
 by its large church.  The hamlet never
 reached its destiny as a centre of    
 communication, unlike Eccleshall which
 has a similarly large church.         
 There are 2 farms in Chebsey, 2 old   
 houses, 6 council houses (4 of which  
 are now privately owned), a few       
 attractive houses with well-kept      
 gardens, plus one modern house        
 (although Chebsey is a conservation   
 area and special regulations apply).  
 The old village school is now used as 
 a community centre, and about half of 
 the population are involved in social 
 activities that focus on the church.
