		<content> I live in Zetland Square,just over the
 road is the play park where there are 
 10 swings.Six for the older children  
 and 4 for the younger ones,there is a 
 slide and a see-saw.Near my house is a
 small wood which has an old bomb      
 shelter in it.In the woods there are  
 lots of secret paths and hiding       
 places.When you get out of the wood   
 there is a farmer's field and caravan 
 site where people put their caravans. 
 At the end of the site there is a hill
 but it is not very big,it has lots of 
 paths.                                
    At the front of Roberto's house    
 there is some grass,we play football  
 there with friends.There are some     
 trees there,like the ones at the back 
 of my house.They are fir trees and are
 very dark green.In the autumn we go   
 blackberry picking near the caravan   
 site and sometimes we find mushrooms. </content>
