		<content>    In our area there are a few big    
 houses, but mostly they are family    
 sized or bungalows. They are made out 
 of brick, stone and slab stone. In    
 Milton there are quite a few farm     
 houses and cottages. There are not any
 building sites or flats. Some of the  
 houses are very old. Many of the      
 modern houses are to be found in the  
 new developments around the Wyke area.
    Some houses are so old that they do
 not have anyone living in them. Barns 
 are being converted into living       
 accomodation. Some of the old houses  
 have very thick walls to keep the heat
 in. Some are of historical interest   
 and are listed buildings.
