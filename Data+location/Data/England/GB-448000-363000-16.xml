		<title>16PRINCIPAL FEATURES (a)</title>
		<content> The principal features of the area    
 seemed in the opinion of the local    
 people to be firstly the village is   
 divided into Nottinghamshire and      
 Derbyshire by the river Meden. A good 
 bus service to Chesterfield,          
 Shirebrook and Mansfield, a very large
 chimney, the 'Meden Trail', the Swan  
 Inn, the Old People's flats and a     
 large traffic roundabout.             
 The roundabout as well as being one of
 the principal features of Pleasley,   
 preserves the character of the village
 but unfortunately has not been        
 completed. The bus service is very    
 popular and the local people seem very
 happy with the service, although one  
 or two people criticised it, saying   
 that the buses were either too early  
 or too late.The chimney to some is an 
 eyesore, while others think it is a   
 landmark with character for Pleasley. </content>
