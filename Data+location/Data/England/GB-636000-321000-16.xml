		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN SUTTON</title>
		<content> Although Sutton has always been an    
 agricultural village few people are   
 now employed on the land. Changes in  
 farming practices and increased       
 mechanization have reduced the need   
 for manual labour. Some people are    
 employed by local businesses but many 
 people travel into Norwich and        
 Yarmouth to work. Others are employed 
 at the nearby Bacton Gas Terminal and 
 local R.A.F. stations at Coltishall   
 and Neatishead. The small businesses, 
 shops and boatyards of Stalham also   
 provide work for Sutton people. Some  
 seasonal holiday work is also         
 available.
