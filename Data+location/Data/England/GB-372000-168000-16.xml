		<title>16COURT FARM, LANGRIDGE</title>
		<content> Our class visited Court Farm, Lang _  
 ridge, the home of Mr.&amp; Mrs.Bowyer to 
 ask about the farm.The farm is known  
 to be about 800 years,the age of the  
 house is uncertain but parts may be of
 a similar age to the adjacent Norman  
 Church known to date from Cl2th. There
 is evidence that the prison and court 
 room were used for the dentention and 
 trial of prisoners after the Battle of
 Lansdown.Judge Jeffreys is said to    
 have held court proceedings here.     
 Today Court Farm consists of l83acres;
 40 acres of which are not under inten 
 _ sive cultivation due to a variety of
 reasons, eg.poor drainage, steepness  
 of land making use of machinery diff_ 
 icult.Farming is mixed, some land down
 to grass, silage has been made,in     
 common with other local farmers, using
 large black polythene sacks, involving
 small capital outlay.                 </content>
