		<title>13NON-WOODLAND:NON-FARMING</title>
		<content> As most land in the area is well-used 
 for farming,woodland or residential   
 purposes the area remaining to this   
 section was limited. Model Farm has   
 land next to the new link road which  
 is wetland and permanent meadow grass 
 land. It is bordered by willows, with 
 buttercups, rushes and reeds. Some    
 grazing for cattle, although too wet  
 for sheep. The land was drained at the
 start of the century, with latteral   
 drains added later, enabling more gra-
 sing land to be obtained. With drain- 
 ing of the land it was discovered that
 the first 9" is loam, the next 12"    
 heavy clay and below that sand. A     
 small disused quarry exists in Weston,
 from which some stone has been used   
 to build houses in the village.
