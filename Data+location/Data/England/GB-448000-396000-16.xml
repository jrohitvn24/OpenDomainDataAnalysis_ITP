		<title>16A new housing estate</title>
		<content> Looking at the estate at the SE end of
 Hill Top Road, Conisbrough, we notice 
 that there is a mixture of houses and 
 bungalows. Some are semi-detached and 
 some are in terraces of 3, 4 or 5. The
 houses are well spaced in rows; in    
 cul-de-sacs; and around paved and     
 landscaped areas. All the houses had  
 their own back garden for which the   
 occupants are responsible. But the    
 front gardens are not fenced off and  
 are tended by the local authority.    
 Most residents do not like the open   
 plan design because dogs and children 
 trample over the flower beds and it   
 seems less private and noisier.The    
 streets are well lit, free from litter
 and have bus stops at regular         
 intervals. Most people like the design
 of the houses but feel that they are a
 long way from the shops, churches and 
 garages.                              </content>
