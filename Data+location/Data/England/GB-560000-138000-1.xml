		<content>{The Pembury Area and the Area to the  
{South.}                               
 The area covered is primarily         
 agricultural. The major land use      
 category is pasture, on which         
 cattle graze. There are large         
 tracts of woodland to the east, near  
 Kipping's Cross, much of which is at  
 present being felled. The area is     
 encircled by roads, only small lanes  
 reach into the farmland. This central 
 area rises to 132 metres and is       
 crossed by small streams.             
  To the west lies the outskirts of    
 Tunbridge Wells, an attractive area,  
 partly residential, with two schools,,
 and very pleasant parkland. It is     
 known as Sandown Park.                
  To the north lies the village of     
 Pembury. This is the most populated   
 area of the 12 square kilometres.
