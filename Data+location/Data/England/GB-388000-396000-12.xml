		<content> The carnival happens once a year in   
 Droylsden. Carnivals happen all over  
 the North West in towns and cities.   
 These festivities are to raise money  
 for charities in the local area.Queens
 Princesses and Rosebuds that have been
 selected for their town dress up cars 
 and put them in the carnival parade.  
 They win prizes for the best dressed  
 Queen's,Princess's and Rosebud's car. 
 When the parade has finished they all 
 go on to the arena where they smile   
 and curtsey to some judges. In the    
 arena the new Queen,Princess and      
 Rosebud are crowned and the old Queen,
 Princess and Rosebud go into their    
 retiring year. There is usually a     
 fairground where people go after the  
 arena judging to meet their friends.  
 After a long, tiring day they all go  
 home and take the flowers their cars  
 ready for the next carnival.          </content>
