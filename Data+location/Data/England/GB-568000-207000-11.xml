		<title>11A Chelmsford Parish Priest</title>
		<content>   We have been examining the{daily    
{life and work}of our local priest. He 
 is{vicar}of a very{modern church}in   
 the middle of a{large housing estate. 
 His day often starts with a{short ser-
{vice}at{06:45}followed by a period of 
 study. After breakfast the rest of the
 morning is spent in{church matters.   
 After lunch he{visits}the{sick}and the
{old,}to pray with them and to help and
 advise them. As a priest he{cannot    
{just be Christian}while he is{at work.
   He says that you need to be a very  
{"calm sort of person"}to do the job.  
 He comes into our school weekly to    
 talk to us. He thinks this is a very  
 important part of his work because it 
 is often the only contact children    
 have with the church. It seems to us  
 that a{priest}must be a{very special  
 kind of{person}and so is a very       
{valuable member}of{any community.     </content>
