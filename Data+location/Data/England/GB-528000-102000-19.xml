		<title>19KEMP TOWN, BRIGHTON.</title>
		<content> Kemp Town, named after its creator    
 Thomas Read Kemp, consists of Lewes   
 Crescent and Sussex Square flanked on 
 both sides by Chichester Terrace, with
 private gardens in the centre. It was 
 planned as a self-contained entity and
 was inspired by Nash's development in 
 Regent's Park, London.Kemp Town  was  
 planned by Amon Wilds and Charles     
 Busby in the 1820's and was completed 
 by about 1850. Beneath the original   
 Kemp Town cliffs are a series of      
 slopes and esplanades which had a     
 private tunnel under the Rottingdean  
 road to the Central Gardens.The former
 are now used by the public.This is a  
 Conservation Area- deservedly so- the 
 grandeur of the cream stucco          
 buildings and the green of the shrubs 
 against the azure sky is one of the   
 finest sights of Britain.
