 THIS WENT ON FOR JUST A FEW MOMENTS.  
 ON ANOTHER OCCASION MRS RATTON WAS    
 BEHIND THE BAR WATCHING THE SUCURITY  
 TV SCREEN WHEN A MAN AGED AS SHE      
 WATCHED. SHE WENT DOWN TO WHERE HE HAD
 BEEN AND THE AIR WAS {RED HOT.        
 ON ANOTHER OCCASION FIVE PEOPLE,      
 INCLUDING MRS RATTON, WERE IN THE     
 LOUNGE WHEN THE CURTAINS OPENED  AND  
 A STRANGE MIST ROLLED IN. AT THIS,    
 EVERYBODY RAN OUT OF THE LOUNGE BAR.  
 ON THE LAST OCCASION MRS RATTON WAS   
 TALKING TO A FRIEND, THE FRIEND       
 TURNED AWAY. WHEN SHE LOOKED BACK HALF
 HER FACE WAS HERS AND HALF WAS A      
 STRANGER'S.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
