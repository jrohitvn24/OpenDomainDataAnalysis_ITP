		<content> We asked people whether their house   
 was owned,rented or was tied to their 
 job.                                  
 Of those that replied 69% owned their 
 house, 23% lived in tied houses and 8%
 rent their house.                     
 67% of houses are built of natural    
 stone and are quite old, 18% are built
 of re-constituted stone and are       
 fairly modern and 15% are built of    
 other materials.                      
 69% live in detached houses and the   
 rest in semi-detached. There are no   
 terrace houses in the area.           
 62% have central heating fuelled by   
 either electricity or solid fuel, 36% 
 just have open fires and 1 person     
 heats their house by Calor Gas.
