		<title>19THE SCHOOL SPRING FAIR.</title>
		<content>   For a number of years the School's  
{Parents' Association}has organised a  
{Spring Fair}as a means of raising     
 funds to purchase expensive items of  
 equipment which are not affordable    
 using the annual school allowance,    
 e.g. video recorder, computer, etc.   
   As well as the usual{stalls -}cakes,
 fruit &amp; vegetables,books,bric-a-brac, 
 crafts,etc. and{sideshows}- skittles, 
 darts, roll-a-2p,lucky-dip,bowls, etc.
 an{inter-school competition}is held.  
 Several local schools of similar size 
 (Calveley, Tattenhall, Duddon, Acton, 
 Huxley) are invited to send a team of 
 ten children (girls &amp; boys) to compete
 in a number of team fun-games,usually 
 five.The last game is always a water  
 game and is the most popular!         
   At the end of the events the winning
 team is presented with a shield which 
 the school holds for one year.        </content>
