		<title>06Somerset Floods July 1968.</title>
		<content>   Keynsham looks like it does now     
 because of the floods in North Somer- 
 set in July 1968. On the 9th July     
 there were tremendous thunderstorms   
 and the River Chew rose until the     
 banks finally burst. A wall of water  
 rushed down the valley and damaged    
 everything in its path.               
   Three bridges were badly damaged and
 one was completely destroyed (the Avon
 Mill Lane Bridge over the Chew). The  
 bridges over the Chew at Bath Hill and
 over the River Avon to Willsbridge    
 were rebuilt. The bridge over the Chew
 at Dapps Hill was repaired. A car was 
 swept off of Bath Hill Bridge. Charles
 Kaye was swept out of the car and he  
 clung on to a tree for five hours     
 before being saved. The other three   
 people in the car were drowned.
