		<content> Visitors to this area have a good     
 choice of eating places.In this area  
 alone there are at least four         
 restaurants and in some of the hotels 
 their restaurants are open to         
 non_residents,some of which specialise
 in locally caught seafood.            
 There are a number of cafes catering  
 for snack type meals and one hotel has
 a take_away service in addition to its
 restaurant.There are several pubs     
 which serve bar snacks at lunchtime   
 and suppertime,and have gardens in    
 which visitors can soak up the        
 atmosphere and have a good meal at the
 same time.                            
{Population.}This area has a small     
 population which tends to be isolated 
 from the rest of Cornwall.For this    
 reason many people own their own car  
 which they use for commuting and      
 general travel in and outside the area</content>
