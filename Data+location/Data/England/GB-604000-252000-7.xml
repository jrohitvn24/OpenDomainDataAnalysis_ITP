The Vestry of Barking Church is reputed
to be haunted by a "Grey Lady",        
(supposed to have been a nun), as is   
the area around the Church and the old 
Barking Hall.                          
The Old Hall Stables are haunted by    
something that re-arranges objects.    
Barking Hall when standing had a ghost 
in the Countess's bedroom.             
A coachman from the Hall is reputed to 
have hanged himself from an oak that   
formerly grew directly in front of the 
stables, and he haunts this area.      
A headless coachman drives a coach and 
two horses up Parson's Lane to the     
Church or Rectory.                     
Two ghosts have been seen walking from 
the Old Rectory to the Church.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
