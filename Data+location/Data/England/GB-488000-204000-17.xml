		<title>17Transport in The Lee</title>
		<content> With the exception of about half a    
 mile of the A413 in the S.W. corner,  
 all of the{roads}in this block are    
 minor, some being single track country
 lanes with passing places.  The{bus}  
 service is part of the London Country 
 Chiltern Link system.  This connects  
 The Lee &amp; Lee Common with Great       
 Missenden &amp; Chesham, the 2 nearest    
 shopping centres, &amp; though there are  
 buses every weekday, they are         
 infrequent &amp; the service finishes     
 early in the evening.  It follows that
 car ownership is almost universal,    
 many families having two or more cars,
 enabling the many commuters who       
 live in the area to reach the nearby  
{railway stations}at Gt. Missenden     
 (British Rail), Chesham (London       
 Transport) &amp; Amersham (B.R. &amp; L.T.) to
 travel to London to work.
