		<content> In our area there are 16 farms and 2  
 piggeries.There are also stables with 
 hens,geese,horses,and goats.Most of   
 the farms we saw had cattle and sheep,
 and all of them had fields of crops   
 in.Most of the farms were in the Cop- 
 manthorpe and Acaster Malbis area.Bet_
 ween these two  places there is a lot 
 of open land for farms.In the fields  
 the crops include sugar beet,barley,  
 spring barley,potatoes,oil seed rape, 
 wheat,spring wheat,silage and grazing.
 Where "Direct Windows" are now,at the 
 Acaster Malbis juntion,there used to  
 be poultry houses.There is a farm full
 of goats at Nova Scotia,near Acaster  
 Malbis.
