		<content>  There is a police station in Prince's
 Crescent. There is only one policeman 
 living here now although there used to
 be two until 5 years ago. We have had 
 no serious crimes for many years but  
 some houses have been burgaled        
 recently. There are often traffic     
 accidents at Staunton Cross but no-one
 has ever been killed there. Our       
 policeman has to work at Newent, 7    
 miles away, sometimes and he has a    
 motorbike to help him get there and to
 Gloucester and to all the villages in 
 our area. He says he would like a     
 panda car!
