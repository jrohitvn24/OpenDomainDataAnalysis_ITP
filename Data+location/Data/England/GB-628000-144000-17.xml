		<title>17Guston Village - General</title>
		<content>Guston has 80 houses, nearly all       
semi-detached. The council estate has  
40 houses. The play area has swings    
and a climbing frame. There is a bus   
stop, telephone box, a post box and    
'The Chance Inn' pub. The old school   
in now the village hall, and the old   
police station is used for police      
accomodation. There are no shops within
2 miles. Most residents go out to work,
except middle-aged or young house      
wives. Most have moved to Guston in    
recent years. There are few children of
school age. The people shop and work in
Dover. Most have a car, because the bus
service is unreliable. Few people use  
the church.
