		<content>   The Middlewich branch of the Trent  
 and Mersey Canal was built in the     
 1770's for the transport of salt. Salt
 had been mined for 2000 years; by 1888
 there were four saltworks in the town.
 In 1810 the Wardle branch of the      
 Shropshire Union Canal was completed  
 and joined to the Trent and Mersey.   
 The canals are no longer used for     
 transport : rather, for leisure       
 pursuits in the form of boating       
 holidays, trips, and coarse fishing.  
   There are 2 boat sellers, Anderton  
 and Willow Wrean Kearns opposite whose
 dry dock is a shop. Nearby is a       
 milestone saying Shardlow 75 miles,   
 Preston Brook 17 miles, and an        
 inspector's office - Tommy Williams,  
 the lock keeper. Andertons shop sells 
 gas, maps, gifts and souvenirs.
