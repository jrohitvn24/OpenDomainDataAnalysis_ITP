		<title>12SKELMERSDALE - TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Skelmersdale New Town was built to    
 separate{motorists}from{pedestrians   
 and the walk-ways of the town make    
 great use of underpasses and bridges  
 and there are large areas in all the  
 housing areas which are free of       
{motorised transport.}This means in    
 practice that there are no pavements  
 beside the roads but as these are     
 often the quickest routes between     
 different places many people actually 
 walk on the roads.                    
 The town was built for a 'motorised'  
 population but partly as a result of  
 high unemployment this aim has not    
 been achieved and there are signs of  
 planned roads  which have never been  
 built. The design of the town promotes
 the heavy use of Taxis refered to on a
 previous page.
