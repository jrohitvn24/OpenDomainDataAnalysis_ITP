 Farm house is separate and a small    
 printing press uses some of the farm  
 buildings.  All the land is farmed    
 from Stanbridge.{Crops:}The total     
 acreage is 560; 150 acres are used for
 grain, wheat 70 acres, winter barley  
 50 acres andspring barley 30 acres.   
 The wheat and 50% of the barley is    
 sold.  The rest of the barley is used 
 for animal feed. Much of the grass is 
 converted into silage.  {Livestock:}  
 Pasture is used to support a large    
 milking herd of 200 Friesians.  A     
 Hereford bull and 106 Friesian heifers
 are also kept. Milking takes place at 
 both farms using the herring-bone     
 style of milk parlours.{Mechanisation:
  There are 2 herdsmen and 3 tractor   
 drivers. There are 2 'yard' tractors  
 and 4 working tractors.
