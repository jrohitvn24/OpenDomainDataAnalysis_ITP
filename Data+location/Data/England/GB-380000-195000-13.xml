 Kingscote. 39%of respondents claim to 
 use the church and the lack of a      
 resident vicar is regretted.  35% use 
 the village pub and the post office   
 and 26% the village hall. 16% use none
 of these facilities. The only other   
 amenity is a mobile library. The      
 village lacks amenities that town     
 dwellers take for granted such as     
 newspapers and milk delivery, mains   
 gas and drainage, adequate street     
 lights, a school or childrens         
 playground.  However more people(31%) 
 regret the lack of a village shop than
 all of these put together.{CLUBS}in   
 the village include WI, Altar         
 Guild,Sunday School, Playgroup,Toddler
 Group.  There is a parish council and 
 a village hall committee. Barn Dances,
 Carol Singing, talks and a Fun Day
