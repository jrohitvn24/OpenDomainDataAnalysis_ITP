		<title>19LIVING AND WORKING IN SAXTON</title>
		<content>   I get up at 7.00am every day and    
 make breakfast straight away. I eat it
 downstairs. I like to have a cooked   
 breakfast - bacon, egg and tomatoes   
 and maybe sausages. I prepare my      
 working son's packed lunch. Then I    
 have a cup of coffee. I tidy up every 
 day.                                  
   In good weather I then go into the  
 garden to work, but only at weekends. 
 At quarter to twelve I go to my job in
 the school kitchen. I keep all the    
 money I earn for myself. I have dinner
 at school. I have my tea at 5.00pm.   
   I watch very little television as I 
 don't really enjoy it. I run a club   
 for young people at church twice      
 weekly. My favourite food is roast    
 lamb and mint sauce. My favourite     
 drink is draught Guinness and beer,   
 and a cup of tea. I go to bed about   
 11.00pm.                              </content>
