		<title>04Farming:beef at Cradley Hall</title>
		<content>    150 beef{cattle}and 200{sheep}are  
 fattened for slaughter each year.     
 Unlike most of the farms in this area 
 the stock are not reared on the farm  
 itsself and the farmer does not use   
 local markets all the time.  He owns  
 his own flat bed bulker and his own   
 haulage equipment.  He buys most of   
 his{cattle}from Yeovil market in      
 Somerset and He sends some weekly for 
 slaughter at Cinderford abattoir in   
 the Forest of Dean.  Lambs are bought 
 in the autumn and sold at springtime. 
{Cattle}are fed on{silage}during the   
 winter but are let out in the spring. 
   The usual{rotation of crops}is 2    
 years of winter whear, 1 year of      
 barley and 2-3 years of ley.  About   
 half the fields are ley and half      
 pasture.
