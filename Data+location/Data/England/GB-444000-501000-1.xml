		<title>01General description, Swainby</title>
		<content> With a history of rural economy, this 
 area now includes a good proportion of
 commuters to Teesside and the North-  
 allerton administrative centres. The  
 A19, running N-S, gives speedy access 
 to Middlesbrough, Stockton or the A1, 
 and the A172 carries traffic towards  
 the coast.{Swainby}is a gateway to the
 NY Moors National Park; visitors are  
 attracted by the splendid scenery of  
 the Cleveland Hills. It is a thriving 
 village with a post office, general   
 store, church, chapel, school, village
 hall, hairdresser and craft shop. Many
 self-created activities and entertain-
 ments take place. The 6 public houses 
 prosper from local and incoming trade.
 Much voluntary funding will be needed 
 for upkeep of public buildings during 
 the next two years.{Potto}is a quiet  
 friendly village without shops or hall
 but a new village hall is planned.    </content>
