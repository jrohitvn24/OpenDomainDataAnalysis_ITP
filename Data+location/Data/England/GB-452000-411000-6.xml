		<title>06A Christening</title>
		<content>   Well, when Sharon asked if I could  
 go to the christening. I was          
 delighted. Kimberly is no relation to 
 me, she is Sharon's neice. We had to  
 be down at the local St. Peter's      
 church by 11.30.I wore a black and    
 blue dress, with jewelry.The children 
 were about 7 months old.There were    
 about five children being christened. 
 They wore little suits or dresses.    
 Kimberly wore a white lacy dress and  
 bonnet.She did not cry when the Vicar 
 put a cross shape on her forehead.    
 Afterwards we went back to Mary's     
 house for refreshments.We had         
 sandwiches, buns and,best of all, a   
 big cake shaped like a baby,with      
 frilly icing all over.Afterwards we   
 all went home. We were exhausted.     
   The baby was christened{Kimberly Ann
