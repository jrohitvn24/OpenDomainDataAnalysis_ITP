		<content>{Turlin Moor                           
 This area is mainly{residential. }It  
 is a quiet area with few cars.  The   
 houses are mostly terraced or semi-   
 detached and there are also several   
 blocks of flats.  The buildings are   
 quite new with small neat gardens and 
 the flats have grassy areas around    
 them. There are some small{shops}and  
{schools;}Turlin Moor First and Turlin 
 Moor Middle School.                   
 A{railway line}cuts through the area  
 from{Hamworthy Junction}to{Rockley    
{Viaduct}and there is a regular bus    
 service.                              
 It is very easy to get lost in Turlin 
 Moor because there are lots of small  
 paths and some of the roads are       
 labelled the same.                    
 The area is bordered by{mudflats}and  
{the River Lea.
