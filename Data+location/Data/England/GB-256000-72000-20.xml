		<title>20The Origin of Princetown</title>
		<content>   About 1Km outside the village of    
 Princetown, on the road to Whiteworks 
 lies Tor Royal farm. This was the home
 of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt who first      
 established the farm in 1785. It is to
 this man that Princetown and Dartmoor 
 Prison owe their origin.              
   It was his idea to try and convert  
 the barren moorland into fertile farms
 and build a model town He was not very
 successful with his farming but the   
 re-start of the war with France and   
 his idea of the building of a war     
 prison were the beginnings of         
 Princetown, which was named after the 
 Prince Regent.                        
   Tor Royal is still worked as a      
 Dartmoor farm but some of the         
 outbuildings have been converted into 
 small workshops by COSIRA. There is a 
 memorial plaque to Sir Thomas in the  
 church.                               </content>
