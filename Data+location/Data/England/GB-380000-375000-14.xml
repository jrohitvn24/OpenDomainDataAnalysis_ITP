		<title>14MARY DENDY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>     The Mary Dendy Hospital was opened
 in 1898. It was named after a         
 ministers daughter from Manchester who
 founded the hospital. Mary Dendy found
 out that many mentally retarded       
 children were not benefitting from    
 school. She took 20 children to start 
 with to care for at home. This soon   
 grew to 200 within in a few years. The
 hospital is now part of the National  
 Health Service and at the moment has  
 282 patients.                         
    Children are no longer admitted and
 the patients are mainly in the 50-60  
 age group and the youngest is 16. Very
 few are now admitted as the new idea  
 is for mentally handicapped people to 
 live in small units in the community. 
    The hospital spreads over a wide   
 area as different houses have been    
 added over the years. Parts of it are 
 in three of our kilometre squares.    </content>
