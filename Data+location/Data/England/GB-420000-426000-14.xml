		<content> The Red House is so called because it 
 was built of red bricks rather than   
 the local stone.The Taylor family     
 built and owned Red House from        
 1660-1920.The Taylor's made and dealt 
 in cloth, farmed and later owned the  
 Gomersal bank.The Red House as you see
 it today has had many changes,it is   
 furnished as it was about 1820.       
   Charlette Bronte stayed with her    
 school friend Mary Taylor at Red House
 between 1831 and 1840.In her novel    
 'Shirley' Red House can be recognised 
 as Briarmaids and the Taylors as the  
 Yorke family.                         
 Another notable local figure is Joseph
 Priestley,born 1733,a scientist who   
 discovered oxygen.
