		<title>11S. LEONARD'S HOMES</title>
		<content>      S. Leonard's Children's Homes    
 stand quiet, silent and empty.   Every
 one of the original buildings is      
 there.   The grass is overgrown and   
 weeds are everywhere.   The cottages  
 have been boarded up.   There is a lot
 of ivy over some doors.   The chapel  
 is still there but the statue of      
 Charity and two children has been     
 removed to a museum.                  
      The Homes were built in the last 
 century for the poor children and     
 orphans of East London.   It was a    
 self-contained village with eleven    
 cottages, a hospital, school, chapel, 
 bakery, workshop, needleroom, stores, 
 offices and accomodation for staff.   
 They grew their own vegetables and    
 kept their own hens and livestock.    
      The children have gone to private
 foster homes.   Soon the developers   
 will move in and build new houses.    </content>
