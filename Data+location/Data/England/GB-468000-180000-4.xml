 This is a popualar spot, for families 
with small children as there are lots  
of ducks, a few geese and a swan on the
pond. Many people feed the birds.      
There is a garden at one side and seats
to sit on supplied by Johnson Matthey. 
There are 2 houses on the pond and     
places to shelter. Round half the pond 
is a low brick wall. Moorhens and other
wild birds use the pond aswell.        
The pond was cleaned out and renovated 
by a working party led by Mr. Dennis in
the 1970's and therer are still regular
working days by volunteers to keep it  
looking nice.
