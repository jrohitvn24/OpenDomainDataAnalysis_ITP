		<title>01Introdution To Braydon Area</title>
		<content> This is a country area extending from 
 the western edge of the village of    
 Purton to Braydon. Much of the land is
 farmland, notably used for dairy      
 farming and grazing.                  
    The main housing communities are in
 Pavenhill, Restrop, Greenhill and     
 Braydon. These are well established   
 communities, many people having lived 
 there all their lives.                
    Public transport is limited. There 
 is an hourly bus service to Swindon   
 from Purton. The railway station and  
 bus station are in Swindon. The roads,
 although narrow are well maintained.  
    Shopping facilities are to be found
 in Purton along with primary and      
 secondary schools, the library and the
 doctors surgery.                      
    Local employment revolves around   
 the farms and several small local     
 industries linked with the land.      </content>
