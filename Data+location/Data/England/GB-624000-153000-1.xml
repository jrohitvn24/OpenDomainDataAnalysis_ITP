		<title>01GOODNESTONE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The Village is tucked in a fold of    
 rolling countryside and is designated 
 as a conservation area.               
 The village consists of a small       
 council estate called Hospital Meadow 
 Cottages; some old peoples housing;   
 the village Post Office and general   
 store; the Church of England School;  
 the FitzWalter Arms; Church of the    
 Holy Cross and the Mansion.  The      
 remaining houses are almost all owned 
 by the Lord FitzWalter.   Since the   
 village has no through road it is     
 rather isolated; some say it is quite 
 feudal.   Most people use it as a     
 place to live, finding their          
 employment elsewhere.
