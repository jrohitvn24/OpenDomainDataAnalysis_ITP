		<content> Gateshead has an enviable reputation  
 for encouraging recreation and when we
 asked local people to list amenities  
 they used regularly their replies     
 showed their appreciation of the      
 council's efforts. Only l4% said they 
 made no use of local facilities - but 
 7l% said parks and 55% swimming baths.
 Perhaps not surprizing in view of     
 the fact that there are four large    
 parks and three pools accessible to   
 local people. Beggars Wood in Lobley  
 Hill has woodland walks, picnic and   
 play areas, as well as a pitch 'n'    
 put course, while Chase Park,         
 Whickham has tennis and a children's  
 zoo. Saltwell Park with its boating   
 lake and space for scramble bikes at  
 Washingwell Woods completes the       
 picture. Libraries (2l%) and Sports   
 centres (6%) were popular amongst     
 almost a dozen other choices listed.  </content>
