		<title>11HESWALL</title>
		<content> Heswall is a town near the River Dee. 
 When ever the tides are right the Dee 
 sailing club have races along the Dee.
 The boats they use are called squibs. 
 Squibs are made out of fibreglass and 
 the mast is metal. More often than not
 the sails are made out of nylon       
 because it is cheaper than cloth and  
 it is strong and waterproof. When the 
 race is over the sailors all go into  
 the clubhouse for a drink of beer.    
 When they sail, they often sail up to 
 West Kirby. From our house we can see 
 them sailing past.
