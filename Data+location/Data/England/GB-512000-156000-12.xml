		<content>    {Randalls Park Farm}is now a       
 private house of the Tudor / Victorian
 period.{Manor Farm}is a farm cottage  
 for Slyfield Farm.                    
   {Barracks Farm}is still in working  
 order. Mr. Gunther, the owner thinks  
 that the farm is named so because     
 Cromwell is said to have stabled his  
 horses there. One of the rooms is kept
 at a temperature of 80 degrees F, this
 is where the turkey chicks are kept   
 within a large cardboard ring. A calor
 gas lamp keeps the temperature at 115 
 degrees F above them. At six weeks    
 part of their top beak is removed to  
 stop them pecking each other. They eat
 high protein food costing Â£200 a ton. 
    By 11 weeks the males are          
 developing a flap of red skin. The    
 turkeys are now being fed a mixture of
 grain, chemicals and fishmeal by an   
 automatic feeder.                     </content>
