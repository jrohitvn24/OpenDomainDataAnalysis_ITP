		<title>13Cotswold Stone Quarrying (4)</title>
		<content> Dumper trucks load the stone at the   
 quarry face into an enormous truck    
 which holds 25 tons and carries       
 15,00 tons a day. It travels at       
 35 miles an hour across the quarry to 
 the crusher. The crusher operator     
 signals when he is ready for the lorry
 to tip its load into the chute. The   
 mighty hammers inside the crusher     
 demolish the massive stones into small
 bits which travel up a conveyor onto a
 big metal sheet screen which has holes
 in it. This separator sorts the stones
 into correct sizes and they fall into 
 a bin. Lorries drive under the bins to
 load up with small stones. There are  
 chains to open and shut the hoppers.  
 There are six bins, various conveyors 
 and sorting machinery including a     
 washing drum. Pressed concrete bricks 
 are made using surplus products. 2500 
 bricks per hour are made.             </content>
