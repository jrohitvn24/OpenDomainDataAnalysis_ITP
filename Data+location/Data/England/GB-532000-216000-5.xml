Davies Magnet have established an      
export market to New Zealand and the   
Far East.British contracts include work
for the Ministry of Defence and large  
motor companies like Fords.They would  
like to take on more work in Europe but
have to meet the required              
specifications and this takes time.    
The cost of fifth wheel couplings range
from 270pounds to 1300pounds and the   
firm gives discounts of anything up to 
40%.The company use their own material 
specifications and are governed on what
materials they use by the Society of   
Motor Manufacturers and Traders.       
They employ 48 people of which eight   
are apprentices who are trained on the 
site.Every employee lives in the local 
area.The factory is sited next to the  
A10 so has easy access to the main     
trunk roads for supply and deliveries. </content>
