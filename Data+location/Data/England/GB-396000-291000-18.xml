		<content> I interviewed several people around   
 Tipton ranging from 18 to 60 years of 
 age.A large percentage of the younger 
 age group commented on the fact that  
 there are few public amenities such as
 cinemas and youth clubs.They also     
 complained about the mass unemployment
 due to a large proportion of factories
 closing down.Young married couples    
 complained about the lack of          
 accommodation or the poor state of    
 that which they are expected to live  
 in.The older age group had different  
 views.They said Tipton is now a       
 cleaner place to live in since it is  
 now a smokeless zone.Most of them     
 agreed about the lack of public       
 amenities.Some even mentioned the lack
 of community spirit.Most young and old
 mentioned the growth in private       
 housing which gives more people a     
 chance to buy a house.                </content>
