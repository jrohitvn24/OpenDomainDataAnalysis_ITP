		<content> Politics play an ever increasing part 
 in the decisions a farmer makes. Since
 joining the EEC the government has    
 introduced a milk quota because       
 surplus milk was being produced. Local
 farmers believe they keep more or less
 to government wishes but are angry    
 because they think French farmers do  
 not. The farm seems a much less       
 'human' unit than in the past. The    
 family atmosphere is greatly reduced, 
 with fewer members of the faimly now  
 left on the farm and an even greater  
 reduction in man power. Today the farm
 appears to be part of a huge          
 institution rather than single        
 independent unit with its own way of  
 life which was the image of the past. 
 With a machine/electricity dominated  
 age this is hardly a suprising        
 development.                          
                                       </content>
