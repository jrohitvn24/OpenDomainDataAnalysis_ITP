		<title>18PUB LIFE IN NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> It is an interesting life living in a 
 pub.  People of all kinds come into   
 the hotel including farmers,          
 celebrities, most off Central         
 Television, journalists, other        
 publicans and caterers.  The highest  
 percentage of people are locals coming
 in for a pint. We have 5 rooms for    
 residents, who come from all over the 
 world, and a TV room available. Bed   
 and breakfast costs Â£lO.9O. We are    
 frequently booked up but people are so
 desperate sometimes they sleep on the 
 floor in sleeping bags. Bar snacks,   
 Sunday lunches and ordinary meals are 
 available which range from a sandwich 
 to a T-bone steak. We serve all sorts 
 of drinks in the bar, like Coke,      
 Babycham, lager, mild and bitter. We  
 also serve crisps, peanuts and        
 chocolate bars. I like listening to   
 the talk in the bar.                  </content>
