 It is 3.15 AM,my dad is getting up.He 
 makes his flask and sandwiches,has a  
 wash and of he goes to his lorry,a    
 Volvo F12 articulated.                
    Today he his taking wheat to       
 Gloucester for Mr F who owns the      
 lorries and arable land of a few      
 thousand acres.                       
    When he has tipped his load he     
 returns to the drier,reloads for      
 Budley,on his return he loads for     
 morning.                              
    After tea he works in the garden   
 then feeds the dogs,and checks that   
 the bantam hen is still sitting on the
 maran eggs.Soon he comes to sit down  
 with us whilst mum goes to see the    
 horses.                               
      Mum comes back,and before bed    
 they discuss the prospects of the     
 horses for the Royal Show.            </content>
