		<title>05Langton Field Farm - Appleby</title>
		<content>   At Langton Field there are sheep,   
 cattle and horses.Fields are under    
 barley and grass for hay and silage.  
 Crops are not grown for sale but for  
 animal feed.Milk goes to the Dairy to 
 be made into butter and cheese.       
    My dad,John Horn,works on the farm 
 he is the tractor man.The owner,Mr    
 Bell looks after the sheep and the    
 cows.The owner's father looks after   
 the horses.David wilkinson looks after
 the calves and feeds them.Eric Fleming
 milks the cows twice a day.In the     
 morning he milks them from 6:00 till  
 8:30 and at night from 4:00 till 6:00 
    In summer the cows go out in the   
 field.In the winter they  go in the   
 shed and they have silage to eat.When 
 it is lambing season we fetch all the 
 sheep near the farm so they are easier
 to get in when they are ready to lamb.
 Mr.Bell also has race horses.         </content>
