		<title>19MELODIANS</title>
		<content> Formed late summer of 1980.It was     
 inspired by the need to raise funds   
 for the local boys club and the       
 village hall. The first show was      
 performed for 2 nights in November of 
 that year. This show was then         
 performed again in March1981 as well  
 as being taken 'on tour'. This was    
 followed in June 1981 by a 'Black and 
 White Minstral Show' this time for 4  
 nights. Since then there has been 4   
 more productions. Each year the dress 
 rehersal is videoed before an invited 
 audience. Between each year shows the 
 Melodians do numerous shows for       
 charity,churches and old People's     
 Homes.
