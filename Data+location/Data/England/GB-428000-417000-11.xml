		<title>11OSSETT SHOPPING PRECINCT</title>
		<content>   People were asked what they thought 
 of Ossett as a shopping centre.Most   
 people think it is alright for food   
 shops but there are not enough        
 menswear shops.                       
   People thought the Ossett precinct  
 which is pedestrianised was a good    
 idea.Since the cars had been removed  
 shopping was much better and          
 safer.People think that now there is a
 new ringroad Ossett is a much safer   
 place to shop in.                     
   People in Ossett thought there there
 were enough parks in Ossett but they  
 were not in very good condition       
 because of graffiti and               
 vandalism.Litter is another problem   
 people were not using the bins        
 provided.Older people wanted more     
 seats to rest on.
