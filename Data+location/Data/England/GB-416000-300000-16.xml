		<content>The local residents of Drayton Bassett 
in general like the quiet, friendly    
atmosphere and unhurried way of life.  
many prefer the peace of the village   
to the noise of the City. Many         
residents in the village centre are    
retired though people tend to be       
younger in the newer housing areas.    
There were some complaints that        
day-trippers leave litter behind,      
Motorists cut through the village,     
ramblers sometimes stray off foot-paths
onto farmland. Older residents need the
convenience of the local post office   
and general stores owing to the        
restricted public transport service,   
many use a taxi service. There is no   
gas supply to the village. Recreation  
revolves around the public park or     
workingmens club with its bar, snooker 
table and pigeon club. There is a      
village scout troop,womans insitute.   </content>
