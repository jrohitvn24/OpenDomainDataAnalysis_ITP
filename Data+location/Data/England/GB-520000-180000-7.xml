		<title>07Employment in N/Ham/Coll P</title>
		<content>Employment has not changed much in this
area over the years. Unfortunately     
unemployment has increased quite a bit,
as industry is now changing and moving 
out of the area. Most people are       
employed on the railway,in the         
hospitals, on the local industrial     
estates or at British Broadcasting     
House, the television and radio        
transmission centre.Some people travel 
into the centre of London to work.     
There are quite a few mothers who      
work, mainly part-time to bring in     
extra cash for the family,or because   
they have to support their             
family.Quite a few people are skilled  
doing a variety of things from         
bricklaying and carpentry to chef and  
bus driver.Most people are employees   
but a few have their own business,     
mainly connected with the building     
trade.                                 </content>
