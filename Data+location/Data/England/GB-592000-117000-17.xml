		<title>17Sunny Sunday at Rye Harbour.</title>
		<content>    A Sunday morning at Rye Harbour is 
 a meeting place for scores of people, 
 particularly those who are{boating    
{enthusiasts.}Warm sunshine is all the 
 incentive the tourist needs to be     
 drawn to the banks of the River Rother
 to watch the{sailing dinghies or wind 
{surfers}who collect to share their    
 effortless skills with the onlooker.  
    The pub forecourt is invariably    
 packed and the conversation often has 
 a maritime flavour to it.The{new      
{lifeboat house}is the latest          
 manifestation of Rye Harbour's ongoing
 relationship with the sea.            
    Visitors alternatively flock to the
{Information Centre}in the car park or 
 take the 3/4 mile stroll to the mouth 
 of the River Rother.When evening comes
 the village resumes its quiet         
 community life.
