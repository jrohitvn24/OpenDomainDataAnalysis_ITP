		<content> According to 'The Story of Our Village
 1850-1957',compiled by the Women's    
 Institute,{agriculture}in that period 
 was in decline and{market gardening}  
 was soon the greatest employer.       
 Gradually this has decreased and much 
 of the land has been sold for house   
 building.So more people travel further
 to their work.Many men are employed at
 the{Royal Engineer Depot}at Long      
 Marston,within cycling distance,but   
 most use their cars.Others travel to  
 Birmingham,Coventry,Leamington,       
 Stratford-on-Avon and Cheltenham.     
 The{Threeways Hotel}and the two Public
 Houses,{The Butchers Arms and The     
{Kings Arms},employ local part-time    
 staff.J Seyfried (veg.brining plant), 
 one of three grocers shops,one a P.O.,
 and the butchers shop (once the old   
 forge)employ part-time staff.
