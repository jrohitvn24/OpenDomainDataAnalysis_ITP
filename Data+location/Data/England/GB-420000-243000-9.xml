 The public transport which people who 
 live in Ilmington can use is only a   
 very limited service.The main local   
 bus route, to{Stratford,}used to be   
 provided by the{Midland Red Bus       
{Company}and it was subsidised by the  
 government and by the local           
 authority.The coaches are now run by a
 private bus company,{The Meon Valley  
{Coach Company}operating from{         
{Moreton-in-the-Marsh}.They run on     
 Monday,Wednesday,Friday and Saturday  
 to Stratford (fare=80p for an adult&amp;  
 child) and on Tuesday to              
 Moreton-in-the-Marsh (fare=40p for an 
 adult&amp;child.Private hire journeys can 
 be arranged.The majority of people who
 live in Ilmington have their own{cars}
 but there is also a private{taxi}     
 service which operates from the       
 village.                              </content>
