  In Marnhull recreation ground  there 
 is an Adventure Playground.In it there
 is a big ship made of wood.It has a   
 cabin and a ladder going up to the top
 deck.There are swings,slide and bars. 
 There is a big hump of earth and it   
 has two tunnels going through the     
 middle.There is also a sandpit.There  
 are logs you can climb and a climbing 
 frame with netting.In the village hall
 the playgroup meets for three to four 
 year olds.The parents of the playgroup
 built the adventure playground in     
 1980.Most of the materials to build   
 it were given by local people and     
 firms,so the cost was only Â£181.The   
 playground won second prize in the    
 Dorset Village Venture Competition in 
 1981 and was featured on TV when some 
 of the infants from our school were   
 seen playing on it.                   </content>
