		<content>The redevelopment recently of the fine 
18th century farmyard for use for small
industries has attracted visitors from 
home and abroad. In the Bridal Barn,   
the Cotswold Woollen Weavers display   
all the processes which produce their  
desirable woven articles, and at home, 
women knit garments for sale in the    
shop, using wool from traditional Brit-
ish breeds. In the Oat Barn a craftsman
cuts and carves stone for decoration,  
while in the Stable is a furniture res-
torer. Two men work in the Calf Pens,  
one with cane and rushes, the other at 
wood turning. A further building houses
the Cross Trees Art Gallery, which fea-
tures local artists. In the Bridal Barn
also are pieces in porcelain (both     
sculptural &amp; functional) by an artist  
living in the village, whose work has  
been widely recognised.
