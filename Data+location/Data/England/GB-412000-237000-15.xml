		<content> Most of the animal life can be found  
 in the dense area of woodland called  
 Weston Park. Badgers,foxes,squirrels, 
 hares and rabbits are fairly common,  
 roe deer and muntjac have been sighted
 in Weston Wood. {Birds}have been      
 affected by the agricultural changes  
 i.e.the skylark population falls as   
 the old pastures are ploughed up. The 
 rough grazing on Dover's Hill supports
 a great many yellowhammers and the    
 fly catcher in Summer. There are great
 tits, blue tits and the shyer long    
 tailed tit searching the copses in    
 Winter.Collared doves are on the      
 increase and many mistake their call  
 for the cuckoo who arrives here on    
 24th April.Herons search the brook,   
 sparrow hawks and kestrels keep watch.
 Green and spotted woodpeckers live in 
 the woods and at night the barn and   
 the tawny owl hunt their prey.        </content>
