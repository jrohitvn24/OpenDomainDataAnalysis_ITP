		<content> The area predominantly consists of    
 rough fell, rising to just over 700   
 metres.  The river Glen Deramackin    
 crosses the area and lies in the      
 bottom of glaciated valleys.  The     
 fells were mined for minerals in the  
 past so there are remains of Adits and
 spoil heaps. The eastern edge is much 
 flatter and is the Eden valley, a     
 fertile farming area.  Mungrisedale is
 the only village, though there are    
 several farms.  There are very few    
 amenities; no shops, only a church,   
 a pub, and a village Hall. Farming is 
 mostly of sheep, though there are     
 cattle on the lower ground. All       
 buildings are made of natural stone   
 (slate from the fells or red sandstone
 from the Eden valley).  The           
 inhabitants take part in village      
 activities such as young farmers      
 groups, W.I., village dances.         </content>
