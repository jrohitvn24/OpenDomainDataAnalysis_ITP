		<content>The twelfth century abbey has big      
modern buildings too.The {monks}       
pursue their traditional way of life   
as well as promoting {tourism}.        
Attractions include pottery,cafe,bird  
and garden centres.Visitors also pray  
in church.                             
25 monks live there and rise together  
at 04.40.They then go to an hour-long  
mass.A boy spent a whole day there -   
"All the monks kneel at the altar and  
then they go to their stalls.They are  
chanting a Latin prayer until everyone 
is settled."At breakfast-"The men      
stand by their places and say Grace in 
Latin, then they sit and eat in total  
silence. When they have finished they  
rinse their cutlery in cold water and  
wipe it with their napkins.They then   
return to mass".Tasks include          
gardening whilst spare time can be     
spent at the 44000 book library.       </content>
