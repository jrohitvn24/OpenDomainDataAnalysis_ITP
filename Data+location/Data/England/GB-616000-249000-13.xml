		<title>13REDHOUSE FARM INTERVIEW</title>
		<content> The farm is owned by Mr&amp;Mrs Templeman,
who have lived there for 3 years.They  
have 180 acres of land,which is used   
for cereal crops.They had pigs until   
1984 when they were slaughtered because
they had Arjeskies disease,but they are
restocking with different breeds and   
also fattening cattle later this       
year.Present livestock-2 donkeys,1     
pony and 1 goat.                       
 The house was built in 1450 and still 
retains many original features         
e.g.windows. Both the house and the    
nearby barn are listed buildings. The  
barn has interesting old beams and was 
originally thatched but now has Suffolk
pantiles.                              
1980's- Mr Templeman feels there is a  
  great uncertainty in farming due     
to the   surpluses caused by too great 
an efficiency for consumption.
