		<title>18THE PEAR ORCHARD</title>
		<content> The pear orchard is 135 acres,the     
 pears are used to make Babycham (a    
 champagne type drink),there are also a
 few trees with edible fruit.The pears 
 are harvested in the Autumn.First of  
 all the workers come along in a       
 tractor with a machine on the back    
 which clamps round the trees and      
 shakes down all the fruit.Then another
 machine comes along which lifts the   
 pears and puts them into boxes.There  
 are sheep in the orchard which graze  
 nearly all year round.There are two   
 cattle grids,which stop the sheep from
 getting out onto the road.The orchard 
 is sectioned and more grids keep the  
 sheep for wandering.There are also 20 
 bee-hives in the orchard and in the   
 spring they train the Beagles in and  
 around the orchard.
