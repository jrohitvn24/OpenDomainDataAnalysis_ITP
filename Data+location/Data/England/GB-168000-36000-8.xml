 The village school is situated one    
 mile out of the village on the main   
 road to Helston. It was built to serve
 a rural community before the village  
 existed as a village.It was built in  
 1875 and was opened as a Board school 
 on the 18th January of that year.Our  
 school is a Junior and Infant one with
 120 pupils, 5 teachers and 8 assistant
 staff.The school sends children to    
 four Secondary schools because we are 
 sited on a boundary,these are Pool,   
 Helston, Redruth and Camborne.        
  Just a small part of our area comes  
 into the catchment area of a school to
 our North called Carnkie.             
 There are no evening classes or       
 Further Education classes held in the 
 village,classes are held at Pool 3    
 miles away.                           </content>
