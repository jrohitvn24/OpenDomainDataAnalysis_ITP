		<title>06School community activities</title>
		<content> The education of the children within  
 the school aims to give the child an  
 understanding of the community in     
 which it lives. School functions are  
 therefore greatly linked with village 
 life.                                 
 The children celebrate religious      
 festivals Harvest Christmas and       
 Easter in one of the local churches.  
 Older members of the population are   
 encouraged to visit the school for    
 seasonal entertainment.               
 The children also take part in a wide 
 range of other events such as the     
 annual Gritworth Fayre _ when a team  
 of older children take part in        
 competitive races with children from  
 other village schools.The school also 
 organises its own events through a    
 Parent Teacher Association which holds
 monthly Whist Drives, Bazaars and     
 Jumble Sales.                         </content>
