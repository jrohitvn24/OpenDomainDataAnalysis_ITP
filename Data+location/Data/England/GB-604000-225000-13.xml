{Spitalfield Market}in{London.}They    
 grow{tomatoes,cabbages,celery,        
{cucumbers,and marrows.}The present    
 owners moved there 4 years ago,when   
 two thirds of the land was wood and   
 one third was barren.For the first    
 year they lived in a caravan. Since   
 then they have put up{six greenhouses,
{2 plastic tunnels, 1 packing shed}and 
 their own{house.}                     
  In the summer, all the vegetable are 
 watered every afternoon.To remind the 
 owner to do this he has a calculator  
 with an alarm,it is set every half    
 hour.Some of the equipment they use   
 includes a{tractor,}a{rotavator,}a    
{planter,}a{blocking machine}and       
{irrigation pumps.}The owners also keep
{chickens,ducks}and{geese}and they sell
 their eggs locally.                   </content>
