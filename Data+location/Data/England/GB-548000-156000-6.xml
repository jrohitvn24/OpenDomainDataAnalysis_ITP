		<content> Housing in the area varies widely in  
 price.                                
 In Dunton Green houses at the North   
 end tend to be dearer than ones at the
 South end, and some 25% of the housing
 is Council Housing. Nearly all housing
 here is brick-built and pre-1960, some
 much earlier. D.G. also has a caravan 
 site. NW Otford &amp; Chipstead have more 
 private estates, many built in the    
 1960's &amp; later. Building materials    
 there include tiles &amp; some boarding.  
{House prices}in our block advertised  
 on one day ranged from Â£47950 to      
 Â£128500. Average price in Chipstead   
 was about Â£98000. 3 &amp; 4 bedroomed     
 houses were common, some had 5, a few 
 2. Some had full double-glazing &amp;     
 central heating &amp; that raised prices. 
 Fully equipped kitchens &amp; double      
 garages also affected price.
