		<content> As a Christian priest I want to       
 reflect the love of God that I know in
 my life. My priestly duty involves    
 administering Holy Communion,         
 baptizing adults who turn to Christ   
 and children of Christian families,   
 preparing people for Confirmation,    
 marrying couples according to the     
 rites of the Church of England,       
 conducting funeral services,  praying 
 the daily offices and joining in      
 Christian worship. I visit the sick   
 and bereaved.I work with parishioners 
 in the concept of"the parish caring   
 for the parish",and we maintain the   
 Church buildings, furnishings and     
 churchyards.I work with neighbouring  
 parishes particularly those in the    
 Dunstable Deanery and co-operate with 
 Christians of other denominations in  
 ecumenical affairs. I am a governor of
 3 local schools. Rev J Shepherd       </content>
