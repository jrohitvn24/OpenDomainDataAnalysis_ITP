		<title>13Lower Tulleyswells Farm</title>
		<content>  We went to Lower Tulleyswells Farm.  
 The Thomas family live there.Mrs      
 Thomas never gets lonely in the       
 country,but she likes to be near a    
 town.She does her weekly shopping at  
 Liptons and Bishops in Lewes.She has  
 lived on a farm all her married life  
 because she married a farmer.She often
 goes to Uckfield and says that she    
 would find it hard to have a neighbour
 because of the noise coming from next 
 door and because she would have to    
 keep telling other people to be       
 quiet.She is a governor of Hamsey     
 Primary School at Cooksbridge.        
  The house was built in 1786.It has 11
 rooms and a separate flat for her     
 Aunt.On the roof there are 3 different
 types of tiles because the roof has   
 been changed many times.There was also
 some French flint.She does Bed and    
 Breakfast and has a caravan site.     </content>
