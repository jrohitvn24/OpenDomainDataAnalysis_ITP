 of the Vale of York.  The soils are   
 generally fertile - consisting of     
 medium and sandy loams.               
                                       
 The most important crops are spring   
 barley, wheat, sugar beet, winter     
 barley and oilseed rape.  A few oats, 
 potatoes and horticultural crops are  
 also grown.                           
                                       
 Pigs are the main type of livestock   
 reared, followed by cattle, sheep and 
 poultry.
