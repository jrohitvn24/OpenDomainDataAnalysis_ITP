		<title>05INDUSTRY IN TOFTWOOD</title>
		<content>   Rashes Green is an industrial estate
 built in the early 1970s by Breckland 
 District Council, to try and attract  
 new industry to the area. It was built
 in Toftwood to be near the new Dereham
 bypass and away from the town centre. 
 In the part of Rashes Green we        
 surveyed there were 585 jobs          
 distributed between 21 companies      
 making various industrial products.   
 The biggest single employer on this   
 estate is the Toftwood Division of    
 Crane Fruehauf which employs over 300 
 people, making specialized trailer    
 units for lorries. Large numbers of   
 these trailers are sold all over the  
 world and the British armed forces is 
 an important customer.                
 The second largest firm on this estate
 is the Bally Shoe Company who own a   
 number of factories in the region.    
 They employ 59 people making shoes.   </content>
