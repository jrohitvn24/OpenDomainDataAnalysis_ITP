		<title>02CHELMARSH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church of St.Peter is an ancient  
 building of stone,consisting of       
 nave,porch and an embattled western   
 tower with pinnacles containing a     
 clock and 6 bells.                    
     In 1888 the church was            
 restored,the roof repaired,the nave   
 reseated in oak,a new organ erected   
 and the screen restored.The stained   
 windows are very attractive but at    
 this time much repair work needs to be
 done to stop any further deteriation  
 in the surrounding stone.In July,1985 
 over Â£6000 had been raised by local   
 people but at least another Â£24000 is 
 needed.                               
       The clock is of a very          
 interesting design and is said to be  
 the only one of its kind in the       
 county.
