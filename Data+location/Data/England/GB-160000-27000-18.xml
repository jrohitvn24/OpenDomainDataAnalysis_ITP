		<title>18FARMING (1)</title>
		<content> The main economic activity in the area
 is now farming. Most of the farms are 
 long established and have been on     
 their present sites for three to four 
 hundred years. Many of the farm       
 buildings still date from this period.
 A typical farm is {Treworlis Barton.} 
 This farm is 75 acres in size. It has 
 a mixture of farming activities. These
 include dairying, the growing of      
 fodder and cash crops, the rearing of 
 pigs and beef cattle and the keeping  
 of poultry.                           
                                       
         The labour on the farm is     
 mainly provided by the farmer and his 
 son who now have their two families   
 living on the farm. A farm labourer is
 currently with them who is undergoing 
 training. Occasionally casual labour  
 is hired.
