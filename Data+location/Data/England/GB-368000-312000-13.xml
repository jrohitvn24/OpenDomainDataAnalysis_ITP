		<content> The original parish of Lilleshall     
 included Donnington Wood. In 1894 a   
 'tin church' was built to serve the   
 needs of old people and children who  
 lived away from the parish church.It  
 was built for the Duke of Sutherland  
 and cost Â£100.The church is dedicated 
 to St.John the Evangelist.It seated 60
 people originally but this was reduced
 to 45 when the pews were replaced a   
 few years ago. The church is licenced 
 for weddings, funerals and baptisms.  
 The first recorded baptism was in 1966
 and baptisms now take place there     
 regularly.There is no record of it    
 having been used for either weddings  
 or funerals.The old tin church is now 
 felt to be inadequate, both in        
 amenities and appearance, for the     
 population of almost 3000 people who  
 live in this area of Telford New Town.
