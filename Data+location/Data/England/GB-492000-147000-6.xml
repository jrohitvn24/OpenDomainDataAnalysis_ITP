		<title>06WANBOROUGH MANOR</title>
		<content> There has been a{Manor at Wanborough  
 since Saxon times but it has not often
 been lived in by the Lords of the     
 Manor. At the end of the{19th Century 
 it was let to Sir Algernon and Lady   
 Mary West. He was private secretary to
 Gladstone, who visited the Manor      
 during Sir Algernon's tenancy, as did 
{Queen Victoria}and Asquith.           
                                       
 During World War I the house was used 
 as a{military hospital}and it was then
 that during renovations two priest's  
 holes were discovered. There is       
 reputed to be a ghost.                
                                       
 The house was let to the{S.O.E.       
 during World War II and was used for  
 the training of agents who were to be 
 parachuted into enemy held territory, 
 where they worked with the resistance 
 movements.                            </content>
