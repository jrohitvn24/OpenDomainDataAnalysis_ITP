		<content> Most of our area lies within{'The     
{Undercliff'}a region of landslip      
 ground that extends along the island's
 southern coast and which has beautiful
 cliff and coastal scenery,a very mild 
 climate and a rich growth of natural  
 vegetation.The remainder of the region
 lies to the north on{the chalk downs }
 between Whitwell and Ventnor.         
 Ventnor is the main town and it       
 developed from a tiny fishing village 
 into a Victorian health resort and spa
 at a time when Queen Victoria lived on
 the island and as sea bathing became  
 popular.The chief buildings are;The   
 Royal Hotel,Lislecombe,Woolverton     
 Manor,Old Park and several other      
 Victorian villas in the village of    
 St.Lawrence.  The region now is a     
 popular{holiday resort}and retirement 
 area. Fishing and farming are now of  
 minor importance.                     </content>
