		<content>   It is not surprising that Much      
 Hadham has some mysteries surrounding 
 it. Old Hertfordshire legend has it   
 that the spectral Moat Lady appears   
 every year on St.Valentine's Eve,     
 February 13th. She is said to rise up 
 from the waters of the ancient moat at
 Moat Farm, near the village of Much   
 Hadham and claim a "victim" from among
 those who venture too near the moat   
 and  come within range of her         
 supernatural powers. This haunting    
 will continue, so the story goes,     
 until someone is intrepid enough to   
 rescue her bones from the moat and    
 give them "decent burial".            
   Other bits of Hertfordshire lore    
 include the beliefs in "Pook's men and
 witches" and the prudence of "askin'  
 permission o'the wood folk afore      
 puttin' iron to elder.
