		<title>11Social Concern in S.Bradford</title>
		<content> Ever since Bradford began to grow as a
 textile town in the early 19th century
 it has provided work for many         
 different{immigrant groups.}The first 
 immigrants were the{Germans}who moved 
 to Bradford from Leeds.They were      
 business men and began trading in     
 textiles.The potato famines in Ireland
 resulted in an{Irish}influx to work in
 the mills.These groups were followed  
 by the{Poles,Latvians,Lithuanians,    
{Estonians and Ukrainians}who moved to 
 Bradford at the begining and end of   
 the 2nd World War.Since then the{West 
{Indians}and{Asians}have moved into    
 Bradford.The Asians came to work in   
 the mills,particularly on the night   
 shifts.Bradford has accepted all these
 peoples and has had very few racial   
 problems.Most of these people try to  
 keep their own identities and have    
 their own clubs and organizations.    </content>
