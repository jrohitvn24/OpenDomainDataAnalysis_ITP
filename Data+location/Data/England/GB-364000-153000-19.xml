		<content>   Employment in the Midsomer          
 Norton/Radstock areas has changed a   
 great deal since the decline of the   
 Somerset coalfield in the 50s &amp; 60s.  
 Fifty years agop the major employer in
 the area was the coal mining industry 
 &amp; farming where many people were      
 employed before mechanization.        
  Since the decline of the pits other  
 industries have moved into the        
 area,the most important one being     
 printing &amp; associated trades. The     
 largest printing factories in the area
 are Purnells(at Paulton), Mardon      
 Flexible, Standard Check Book and     
 Welton Bag.                           
 Other people are employed in small    
 light industry,banks, offices and a   
 large selection of shops in the high  
 street. Other employers are shoe      
 manufacturers,the local athority and  
 the usual service industries.         </content>
