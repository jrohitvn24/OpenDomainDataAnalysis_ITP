		<content>  For most of the year our area is     
 quiet and peaceful but in the summer  
 months thousands of tourists and      
 visitors swarm into the area.There are
 numerous attractions for them in the  
 Royal Park,with its many square miles 
 of peaceful countryside and the       
 wonderful trees and shrubs.Very few   
 cars are allowed within the park which
 makes it a quiet and safe place for   
 families.                             
  There is also the attraction of the  
 River Thames,probably one of the      
 loveliest rivers in the country and in
 the summer its banks are swarming with
 people just lazing around watching the
 boats go up and down the river.On a   
 hot summer's day it can be hard to    
 find a space on the river bank but in 
 the winter peace returns to our area.
