		<title>09HOUSING - HARMSTON &amp; COLEBY</title>
		<content> Houses here are in demand for their   
 setting among trees, pantiled stone   
 walls and stone farm buildings. Stone 
 cottages set tightly onto the pavement
 defining lane corners, are mixed with 
 modern brick houses of more open      
 character.{ Harmston}&amp;{Coleby}are     
 defined as minor service villages,    
 preserved by strict curtilage defined 
 by the cliff edge and the A607 road.  
 The approx. 125 dwellings in{Harmston}
 include 18 hospital houses, 5 tied    
 farm houses and 16 council houses.    
 The approx. 160 dwellings in{Coleby}  
 include the converted flats of Coleby 
 Hall,6 tied farm houses and 35 council
 houses which are rather cut off by the
 A607 road. Most houses are modernised.
 All have indoor sanitation. New houses
 have double glazing and electric or   
 solid fuel central heating.
