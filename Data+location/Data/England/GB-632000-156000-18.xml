		<title>18Worth Pond; Fund Raising.</title>
		<content>   The pond next to the school has just
had a new lining put in it. This is how
it was done and what happened.         
The thirty residents of Worth who      
started to rebuild the pond began in   
August 1984,because the water kept on  
draining away and there was no fauna   
left in the pond.The people who helped 
do the pond formed a committee and went
from door to door collecting money from
the villagers.The minimum cost was     
{2100 and they raised {700.Then they   
asked the Parish Council and they      
raised with the help of local factories
{3000.                                 
All the water had to be drained out,but
the pond kept on getting water in the  
bottom.This was caused by cracks in    
some of the villagers' water pipes.The 
surplus water ran through the drains   
and into the pond.(continued on next   
page).                                 </content>
