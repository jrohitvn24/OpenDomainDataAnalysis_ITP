		<content> At 6.20 I woke to find my dog Sophie  
 in the bed. I got up at 8.10          
 dressed, washed and had breakfast,    
 cleaned my teeth and cycled to school.
 I had 25 minutes to play "it" with    
 Jason my best friend. The person who  
 is "it" catches the rest. School began
 with assembly for all children. At    
 9.20 we started reading. Maths        
 followed until 10.40 then playtime    
 till 11.00. From 11.00 to 12.05 we had
 English.We wrote an essay called "Life
 in Wartime". Dinner was next. In the  
 dinner hour we played cricket. In this
 game you have a bat and a bowler      
 throws the ball at three stumps in the
 ground. I have to hit the ball away.  
 In the afternoon we had geography and 
 two films about the Domesday Project. 
 I went home at 3.30, watched T.V until
 5.00, then had tea. I played with lego
 till 10.15 when I went to sleep.      </content>
