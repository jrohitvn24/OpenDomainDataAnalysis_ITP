		<title>06MANOR FARM, WALL.</title>
		<content>  The Manor and Pipeplace Farms        
comprise 700 arable acres of light sand
on the bank changing to black peat in  
the valley through which runs a small  
stream. This provides the water for an 
extensive irrigation system which      
covers the whole farm by means of an   
electrically powered pump and          
underground mains. The crops grown are 
potatoes, sugar beet, wheat and barley 
- the latter being fed to the Wall     
herd of pedigree Large White pigs      
founded in 1917 some of which are sold 
for breeding and the remainder for     
bacon. The fields are large each being 
80-100 acres and where hedges have been
removed to ease mechanisation a number 
of spinneys have been planted with     
various hardwood trees. Two pools have 
been dug out fed by spring water, here 
fish and wildlife flourish. The farm is
worked by 6 men and is very mechanised.</content>
