		<content> In the half term week some of the     
 children from the school went to      
{Shortacombe Farm}and saw the cows     
 being milked we got to the farm at    
 about 5.45 a.m.They have 64 cows and  
 we saw 57 being milked. In the parlour
 it will take 8 cows but they milk 4 at
 a time. If a cow kicked there was a   
 steel bar to put on its back to stop  
 it. Before the cows are milked their  
 udders are washed. The milk goes to   
{North Tawton}cheese factory. Then we  
 took the cows up the road and we put  
 them in a field. All the milk went    
 into a big cooler which kept the milk 
 cool until the tanker came to take the
 milk away. There was a tube on the    
 back of the milk tanker then the tube 
 was fixed on to the tanker and it took
 the milk out of the cooler we stood on
 a stool to see the milk all go into   
 the cooler. There was 222 gallons.    </content>
