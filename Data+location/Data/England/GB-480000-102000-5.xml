		<title>05A NEW GAS PIPELINE</title>
		<content> A new{gas pipeline}has been layed     
 under the Brighton and Portsmouth     
 railway and over farmland and then    
 under the A27.The part that went under
 the A27 had to be dug up and traffic  
 diverted.They came to the{creek}and   
 found that rather a problem.As the    
 pipe is 16 inches wide and covering a 
 distance of two miles and weighing    
 over 150 tonnes it was quite difficult
 to move,so they put the pipeline on   
 rollers to move it more easily.Early  
 one morning in July a team of men came
 to inspect the pipeline before it went
  under the sea.By mid-morning the pipe
 had been moved into the water.By the  
 evening it was completly under the    
 creek.The pipe was moved by floats on 
 either side of the pipe.Care had to be
 taken not to damage the{reed beds}or  
 disturb the{wildfowl.}More{Roman }    
 remains were found whilst excavating. </content>
