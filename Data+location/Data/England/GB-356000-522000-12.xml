		<content>    The farming pattern in the area is 
 very mixed depending on soil,         
 landslope and current farming         
 trends.Good crops of barley, turnips  
 and potatoes are grown as food or cash
 crops but with the main crop being    
 grass either as silage,stored fresh   
 grass or hay for use as cattle food in
 the winter.                           
    The main produce is milk which is  
 collected by tanker and taken to the  
 Express Dairy at Appleby.Next comes   
 the rearing of fat cattle and sheep   
 for meat.These are sold at local      
 auction marts. The main breeds are:   
 dairy cattle_Friesian,beef cattle_
