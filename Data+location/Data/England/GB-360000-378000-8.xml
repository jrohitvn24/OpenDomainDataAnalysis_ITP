		<content> The playgroup was started by Mrs Edna 
 Dewar in l969 when it was privately   
 owned. It is held in the Village Hall 
 on two mornings from 9.30 to 12.00.The
 children start at 3 and leave at 5    
 years old when they start school. Five
 years ago it became community run and 
 there is a committee to raise funds.  
 There are two supervisors and two mums
 who help them to play, make things or 
 paint till l0.30. During Register and 
 milk their names are thrown on the    
 floor and they learn to recognise     
 them. Puzzles and games are also used.
 Every other week they have music.There
 is storytime and finger rhymes for all
 They have a coach trip every year and 
 also visits to local farms, museums   
 and places of interest. At present,   
 there are l5 children, although they  
 are allowed to have as many as 24.
