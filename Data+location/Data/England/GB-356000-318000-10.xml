		<title>10Food and Shopping</title>
		<content> The diet of people in this area is    
 traditional rather than exotic.  Their
 food comes generally from 4 sources:l.
 home produced, 2. village shops near  
 to the area, 3. supermarkets in nearby
 towns, 4. markets in nearby towns.    
 Major shopping is usually done once a 
 week in Shrewsbury or Telford.  For   
 minor shopping, general stores in     
 nearby large villages are used.  Most 
 homes will use homegrown vegetables   
 and fruit, and there is a growing use 
 of freezers to extend the season.     
 Some fruit and vegetables are bought  
 at markets and some people sell their 
 own produce there.  Poultry and       
 rabbits are often reared at home,     
 eventually destined for the table.
