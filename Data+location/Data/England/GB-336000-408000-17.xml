		<title>17Farming in Halsall</title>
		<content>                                       
  We interviewed a Halsall farmer who  
said his potatoes were sent to Preston 
and Liverpool markets. He said he had 4
tractors, one combine-harvester, 2     
potato-harvesters, 2 cultivators and 3 
rotivators. The farm has 385 acres.    
They have no animals. They grow wheat, 
barley, corn and carrots. He gets his  
seed from Scotland. In good weather he 
gets a low price for potatoes from 40  
to 140 pounds per ton and in bad       
weather he gets up to 400 pounds per   
ton.                                   
  Most of the employment in the area is
based on farming, with 15 people being 
employed on one farm and 45 with a seed
merchant. Local garages and the public 
house afford some employment so there  
is not a local unemployment problem.
