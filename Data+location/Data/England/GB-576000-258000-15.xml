		<title>15ST.EDMUNDS CHURCH - HARGRAVE</title>
		<content>As I write this narative about the life
of the church in Hargrave, I see in my 
mind's eye a hollow shell of a building
echoing with the sound of pigeons and  
haunted by bats, or sometimes just a   
heap of stones. I have worshipped in   
this place for 15 years, have cleaned  
pews and arranged flowers, polished the
pulpit, scrubbed floors and spent hours
preparing for the festivals, but I have
no confidence that it will continue as 
a place of worship for years to come.  
The building itself is unremarkable.   
The brick tower was built in the 15th  
century when the Chancel was 200 years 
old. The font is 15th century as is the
finely carved screen of a fox, a       
unicorn with dragons, fishes and eagles
The church stands on rising ground to  
the north of the village beside the    
Rectory which is an oasis of trees     
amidst the surrounding prairie farmland</content>
