		<content>      The major industry is area is    
 farming, which owing to mechanisation 
 employs very few people. An overage of
 3 workers (often members of the same  
 family) is sufficient to manage most  
 farms throughout the year,until the   
 busy harvest season when contract     
 labour is brought in. The combined    
 Dunge farms illustraite how the       
 employment picture has changed in     
 the last 20 years. Today 5 men are    
 employed on the 2 farms to look after 
 200 dairy cows. In the 1960's 16 men  
 were needed to cope with 60 cows.     
      A small meat boning and packing  
 business occupies premises on the site
 of demolished ex R.A.F buildings in   
 the square ref.03900155. It was once  
 an abbatoir, but animals are no longer
 slaughtered there. A few women are    
 enployed making pies and sauages.
