		<content> The block is one of contrasts,        
 residential housing in the west and   
 farming in the east with the divide   
 running almost down the middle of the 
 block. The west mainly consists of the
 town of Whitefield now part of Bury   
 M.B.C. and the districts of Unsworth  
 and Sunny Bank.                       
 In the east the land is agricultural  
 with the exception of the village of  
 Simister.                             
 Communications with the rest of the   
 country and surrounding area are      
 excellent having two motorways the M66
 and the M62 and a successful rail link
 with Manchester.The block contains two
 railway stations and a motorway       
 junction linking the two motorways and
 providing access. In Whitefield the   
 bus station is by theside of the      
 railway station providing an important
 bus rail link.                        </content>
