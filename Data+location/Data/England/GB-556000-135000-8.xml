		<title>08THE ERIDGE ESTATE</title>
		<content> The Eridge Estate covers five and a   
 half thousand acres. There are seven  
 tenanted farms on the Estate. Lord    
 Abergavenny decided to give up keeping
 cattle but still has sheep and a few  
 deer in the woods. As well as grazing 
 land there is some arable land too.   
    Altogether Lord Abergavenny has    
 ten workers working for him. He used  
 to have nine foresters but only has   
 two now; there were lots of gardeners,
 but now he only has one gardener and  
 Lord Abergavenny's wife to do the     
 garden. It is a very big garden so it 
 doesn't look as good as is used to!   
      Events and charites are held     
 quite often and sometimes the garden  
 is open to the public. Many riding    
 events are held like three-day-events 
 and sponsored rides, also             
 non-equestrian events like garden     
 fetes.                                </content>
