		<title>03LODDISWELL - HOUSES</title>
		<content> Many council houses, mainly semi      
 detatched, were built after the       
 1939-1945 war. These, like most of the
 post war houses, were built of        
 concrete block construction, rendered 
 and painted, usually white. Some of   
 these council houses have recently    
 been bought by the tenants and many   
 improvements have been made, with     
 replacement windows and doors being   
 fitted.                               
 Near these houses are a number of     
 attractively designed bungalows for   
 old people.                           
 In Fore Street are two brick houses   
 but this is unusual in Loddiswell.    
 Most of the older houses are built in 
 the attractive local stone, probably  
 quarried only a short distance down   
 the hill.                             
 There are only about four thatched    
 cottages now left in the village.     </content>
