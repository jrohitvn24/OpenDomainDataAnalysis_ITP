		<title>14ENGLEFIELD VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Englefield village, which lies near   
 the mansion, is owned by the Estate   
 and includes a Church, village shop   
 and post-office, school, social club  
 and purpose built accommodation for 7 
 pensioners. There is also a garden    
 centre. All houses within the village 
 are let properties. The older cottages
 were built using materials and labour 
 from the Estate. Timber and bricks    
 produced on the Estate were used in   
 their construction. Many of the       
 cottages are similar in style and have
 distinctive brickwork. These were     
 built to house Estate workers, though 
 today some house people who work      
 elsewhere. The most recent buildings  
 are the Estate Pensioners' Flats near 
 the post-office, the additional       
 classroom at the school, and the new  
 vicarage bungalow opposite the school.
