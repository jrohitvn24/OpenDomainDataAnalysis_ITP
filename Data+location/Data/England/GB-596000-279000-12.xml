		<title>12CHRISTMAS DAY IN HOPTON</title>
		<content> Most people spend Christmas Day at    
 home with their families. They        
 decorate their homes with trees       
 covered in small ornaments and tinsel.
 They go to Midnight Mass at church on 
 Christmas Eve.  They start Christmas  
 Day much earlier than usual as there  
 are many preparations to be done.     
 They exchange presents before         
 breakfast. All receive and send many  
 cards and some telephone friends and  
 relatives. Everyone has a proper      
 Christmas dinner of roast turkey,     
 brussel sprouts, peas, potatoes,      
 carrots, cranberry sauce, gravy and   
 stuffing, followed by Christmas       
 pudding with brandy butter. They pull 
 crackers at the table and forget their
 diets.   After dinner they watch the  
 Queen's Speech and their favourite    
 programmes on television.  It is a    
 traditionally happy day.              </content>
