   Two small settlements were mentioned
 in the original Domesday Book,{       
{Ulverlei}and{Langedone.               
{ }Later Ulverlei was moved by its Lord
 to a new site on top of a muddy or{   
{soily hill}overlooking the important  
 crossroads between the roads from     
 Birmingham to Warwick and Droitwich to
 Coventry.                             
   From{Soily Hill}come{Solihull}and   
 the{old town}of Ulverlei became known 
 as{Olton}an area on the edge of the   
 modern town.                          
   Very little happened in Solihull    
 until very recently. 1930 saw the     
 beginning of its rapid rise in        
 political importance to its present   
 status of Metropolitan Borough.
