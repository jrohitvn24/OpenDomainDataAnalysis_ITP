		<title>07Ecology of Mark</title>
		<content> Although Mark is one of the most      
 peaceful villages on the western side 
 of Somerset,it is also buzzing -      
 buzzing with the life of many         
 different{wild species.}It has an army
 of birds of which perhaps the most    
 graceful are the swan and heron. Many 
 different species of{birds}are to be  
 seen - swallows,house martins,thrushes
 and various{preying birds}hovering or 
 stalking their prey.On the Somerset   
 Levels,breeding grounds are protected.
{Foxes}are also inhabitants of Mark.   
 Many a poultry farmer must be bothered
 by those sly red preditors.           
 There are many rhines and ponds which 
 are the dwellings of thousands of     
{animals,insects and fish.}Looking for 
 small amphibians is every small boy's 
 delight and  a good murky pond is just
 the place to find{frogs,toads and     
{newts. }                              </content>
