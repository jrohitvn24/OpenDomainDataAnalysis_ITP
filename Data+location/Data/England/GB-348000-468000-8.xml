		<content>    150 families of Christ Church      
 School were questioned about their    
 jobs. 63 replies were received. From  
 these replies we learned that 58      
 fathers, 42 mothers and 5 teenagers   
 were in work. We divided the jobs into
 six categories.                       
                     Total % of jobs.  
   Tradespeople            22%         
   Professionals           23%         
   Office Workers          11%         
   Shop Workers            18%         
   Transport Workers       13%         
   Others                  13%         
 A total of 22% worked in Carnforth.   
 The majority of men who worked        
 elsewhere worked at Heysham Nuclear   
 Power Station.It was finished in 1982 
 and with over 500 workers is the main 
 source of jobs in this area. Closure  
 of Carnforth Ironworks and Railway    
 Sheds lost many local jobs.           </content>
