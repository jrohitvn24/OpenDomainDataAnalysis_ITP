		<content>The 3rd Banbury Guides who meet at St. 
Pauls Hall in Prescott Avenue, Banbury 
took part in the National Guide week   
which was to celebrate 75 years of     
Guiding. To start the week they spent  
Sunday 23rd June at Oxford City        
Football Stadium. All the Guide        
Companies from Oxfordshire attended.   
The day started with a parade of the   
company flags and a short service. It  
was followed by activities such as tent
pitching, gadget making, chair racing, 
and dancing etc.                       
On the Monday Mrs. Pleydell-Bouverie,  
the County Commissioner visited        
Buckingham Palace to collect a light   
from the "Flame of Friendship" lit by  
Princess Margaret. She brought the     
Flame back to Oxford and the Ranger    
Guides then carried it to Banbury on a 
canal narrow-boat.
