		<content>  Kirk Ireton has one primary school.  
 with two small playgrounds. In the    
 infants playground there is a bell    
 which used to be on the roof.         
  There are{three}classrooms,{Infants, 
{Lower Juniors}and{Upper Juniors.}Next 
 year the Lower Junior classroom will  
 be a library and T.V. room. We will   
 have just{two}classes because there   
 will only be{38}children.             
  There is a kitchen which cooks for   
{Carsington}school too.                
  At 11 we usually go to{Anthony Gell  
{School}in Wirksworth. Some go to{Queen
{Elizabeth's}in Ashbourne.They do not  
 have a school bus provided. At Anthony
 Gell and Queen Elizabeth's they have  
 different teachers for different      
 subjects and move to other classrooms 
 for lessons. They learn different     
 languages. Both Schools are  much     
 bigger than Kirk Ireton.              </content>
