		<title>14COMMUTING TO LONDON</title>
		<content> My Dad gets up at 6.50 &amp; then drives  
 to Thorpe Station to catch the London 
 train.Sometimes it's a bit late.At    
 Liverpool Street,he buys a newspaper &amp;
 catches a bus to Fleet Street where   
 his office is. Dad starts work at     
 9.15. As a chartered accountant he    
 looks after taxes for people. He puts 
 his work on to a tape machine so the  
 secretary can type letters to people. 
 Lunch time is at 12.30 &amp; sometimes my 
 Dad shops in Central London or goes   
 into the park. In the afternoon he    
 often has to attend meetings.They     
 finish work at 5.15 but often work    
 until 6.15.On Monday evenings he plays
 badminton with his friends in London. 
 He is home by 8.30 &amp; we have dinner.  
 Afterwards he takes our dogs out for  
 a walk.                               
 On some nights my Dad goes to P.T.A.  
 meetings.                             </content>
