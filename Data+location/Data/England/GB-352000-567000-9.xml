		<content> Although we live in the country there 
 is quite a lot of traffic on these    
 little country roads.There are wheeled
 bikes and big buses which would hold  
 52 people.The commonest vehicle on    
 these roads is a car which can hold up
 to 5 people but is best just with 4 in
 a car:2 in the front 2 in the back.You
 can get some 4 wheeled drive vehicles 
 such as Landrover but you usually have
 it in 2 wheeled drive when you are on 
 the road .There is quite alot of      
 wagons on these roads as farmers need 
 to use or hire them when buying or    
 selling such things as                
 straw,hay,animals and implements.One  
 of'our maths books asks us to do      
 traffic counts but our teacher said it
 would be a waste of time because only 
 10_15 vehicles would pass here between
 9am and 3.30pm.
