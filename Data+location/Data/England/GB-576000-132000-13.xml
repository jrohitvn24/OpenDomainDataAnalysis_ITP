		<content> The market for milk from Forest Farm  
 has changed recently. The farm does a 
 local milk round once a day, six times
 a week. An eigth of the farm's milk is
 sold locally and untreated milk is the
 most popular. The demand for skimmed  
 milk has increased as more people     
 become concious about healthy diets.  
 Skimmmed milk is used in diets because
 it has less fat in it. In 1946 when   
 the farm first started this product   
 would not have been sold and would    
 probably only have been used to feed  
 animals. Pasturised milk is also sold.
 The milk round has been working for   
 two years and has increased rapidly   
 over this time and is continuing to do
 so . The other seven eighths of the   
 milk is sold at Ashford.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
