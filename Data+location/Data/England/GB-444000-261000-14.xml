		<title>14GAMES, TOYS, CREATIVE PLAY</title>
		<content> My favourite toys are my flower fairy 
 and my little pony. I have two        
 costumes for my flower fairy; one is  
 yellow and the other is purple. My    
 best ponies are Bow Tie and Apple     
 Jack. I like my BMX and I like my A-  
 Team figures and my He Man. I like my 
 Superman Book and my computer games.  
 In my garden Rachel and I play Cindy. 
 I have got two Cindys. I have a lot of
 Cindy clothes. My Cindy worked in the 
 ice cream shop.                       
 Daniel and I played in some long      
 grass. We trampled down some grass and
 made pathways. We made some islands   
 too. They are called Rainbow Island,  
 Buttercup Island and Cross Road. We   
 put pretend treasure in the islands.  
 I went to play with Scott and I took  
 my gun. We played tennis and we played
 on the conker tree.
