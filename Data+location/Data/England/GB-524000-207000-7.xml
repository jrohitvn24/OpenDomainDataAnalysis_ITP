		<content>  A variety of materials have been used
 for the buildings in Essendon _ flint,
 pebble-dash,wood,concrete and brick.  
  Some of the houses in Essendon are   
 quite old, and they have been used in 
 different ways. The oldest houses in  
 the village are number 57 Tiled       
 Cottage (which was built in the 17th  
 century) and Essendonbury Farm,which  
 has been rebuilt.                     
           {ESSENDON HOUSE}            
  Essendon House is one of the biggest 
 houses in the village. Mr Dimsdale who
 owned it was often called Lord        
 Essendon. He did a lot of war work. He
 had one son and a daughter and his    
 ancestors were relatives of Henry VIII
 He moved to Spain where he died and   
 the house was given to his son who    
 could not afford to run it.The house  
 became a Rectory as the rector was a  
 wealthy man.                          </content>
