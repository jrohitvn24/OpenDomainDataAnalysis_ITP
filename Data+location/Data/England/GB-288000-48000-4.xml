		<title>04Fountain Violet Farm.</title>
		<content> Fountain Violet Farm is situated East 
 of Kingswear,very close to the        
 village.It is a mixed farm and quite  
 small,enjoying beautiful views over   
 the Dart.The farm has fine buildings  
 arranged around a central courtyard.It
 has a small herd of 32 Friesian and   
 Jersey cows,which are milked in a     
 parlour of 5 stalls.There are 16      
 heifer calves and 14 bullocks. The    
 cattle graze on the hilly             
 pastures,which are far too steep for  
 crop-growing.As the farm is so        
 small,land is rented at Hill Head for 
 40 breeding ewes.About 30 free-range  
 hens are kept in a henhouse behind the
 farmhouse,eggs are sold locally.The   
 flatter land is used for winter and   
 spring barley.Up to Victorian times it
 was called Mouth Farm,but 2 spinster  
 farmers changed it to Fountain Violet.
