		<content> Stephanie &amp; I went down to{Monk       
{Fryston Square}at 2.30pm. Stephanie   
 &amp; I entered the fancy dress           
 competition.                          
 Stephanie was dressed up as the devil.
 I was dressed up as a jack in a box.  
 There were{three floats.}One for the  
 band. One for the{Queen (Lisa Murray) 
 and her attendants. The last one was  
 for the fancy dress. The floats went  
 down to{Hillam Square}&amp; then turned   
 round &amp; went back to the old vicarage.
 Monk Fryston{ballet school}danced a   
 little play for us. The summer picture
 competition &amp; fancy dress were judged.
 Stephanie &amp; I went to get changed.    
 I had 2 lollies to eat. I bought some 
 bubble bath &amp; I had a go on the teddy 
 bears picnic game.
