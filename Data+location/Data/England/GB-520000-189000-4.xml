		<title>04GRAHAME PARK ESTATE-DEVELOP.</title>
		<content>   Grahame Park Estate was built on the
 runways of the old Hendon Aerodrome   
 and named after Claude Grahame White, 
 the aviator who started the aerodrome.
 The Estate was built by Barnet and the
 GLC to provide homes for 10,000 people
 from Barnet and from over_crowded     
 Inner London areas. In 1971 the first 
 tenants moved in. Part of it is       
 council homes and part privately owned
 houses. There are flats, maisonettes, 
 terraced, semi_detached and detached  
 houses. Most of the buildings are     
 brick, sometimes covered with plastic 
 or red_painted gravel which make them 
 more waterproof.The flats are up to   
 eight stories high with glass walkways
 and a balcony for each flat.I live on 
 the ground floor and share a bedroom  
 with my Mum.If I stand at the window I
 can see a school and in the distance I
 can see the M1 motorway.              </content>
