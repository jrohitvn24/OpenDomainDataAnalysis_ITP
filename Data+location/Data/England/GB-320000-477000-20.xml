		<content> General Observations:                 
    The area covered in this survey, we
 conclude, is most attractive in every 
 way and satifies scientific, domestic,
 aesthetic and leisure interest. The   
 great fear we have deduced during the 
 survey, and which the Research team   
 have pointed out in the field reports,
 is the danger of further industrial   
 development, although this would of   
 course satisfy the requirements of the
 local inhabitants of working age.     
    The majority of the residents of   
 the villages of Furness commute to    
 work in Barrow and the suggestion that
 Askam could be self contained, from   
 the point of view of employment,      
 cannot be envisaged and allocation of 
 land for industry does not necessarily
 mean that this advantage would be     
 taken. The status quo may continue !
