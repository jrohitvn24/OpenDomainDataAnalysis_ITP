		<title>08A MIXED FARM</title>
		<content> On our farm there are six men. 3 look 
 after the animals. The other 3 drive  
 tractors and my Dad drives the        
 combine in the harvest time. When the 
 corn is ripe. The farm is quite big.  
 And in the Summer holidays we have 2  
 donkies from the beach and give       
 children rides.The other animals are  
 cows but they are not dairy cows and  
 then we have sheep which have been    
 sheared because it is that time of the
 year.The tractors which we have are   
 Fords and our combined is a Massey    
 Ferguson.On our farm we have 2 sheds 1
 shed has the combine and some corn in 
 it. And the other one has tools and   
 tractors in it.
