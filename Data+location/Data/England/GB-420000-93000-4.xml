		<content>    The camp opened in 1928. Reginald  
 John Cobb opened the camp. He owned   
 the camp for 39 years. Mr Cobb died   
 in 1967. Reginald had one son called  
 Jim. Jim was the next owner. In 1940  
 four bombs were dropped on the camp.  
 The bombs did not kill anyone, only   
 four rabbits. Cobb's Caravan Park has 
 a club and a shop. The shop opened in 
 1936. The club opened in 1978. The    
 club is a social club. In the club    
 there is a pool table, a dart board, a
 bar and a television. The shop sells  
 gifts, clothes and food. There are 65 
 caravans and 19 chalets. There are    
 four families living on the camp all  
 year. Over 1,000 people come each year
 for holidays.
