		<title>14THE HALL_HUSBANDS BOSWORTH</title>
		<content> The oldest part of the house was built
 in 1540.Since then another part has   
 been built in 1792,later a bay was    
 added to the house in 1823.The old    
 hall was built on Norman foundations. 
 There are some cottages in the grounds
  where some of the servants used to   
 live.The family that live there now   
 have lived there for about 40 years   
 but the actual family have lived there
 since 1661.The Turville family came   
 over to Britain with William the      
 Conquerer in 1066.The old house has   
 been used for 2 things during wars.The
 first is the priest hole which is     
 built under the old hall.It was used  
 for hiding Roman Catholic priests     
 during the Civil war.The other is in  
 the 2nd world war there was an army   
 camp in the grounds outside the hall. 
 The house has about 300 acres of land 
 altogether which gardeners look after.</content>
