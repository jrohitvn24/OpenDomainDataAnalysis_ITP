 Most people find employment outside   
 the area.There are two distinct       
 categories:-                          
 1.The executive type employees and    
 businessmen tend to commute to London 
 or else to surrounding                
 towns,(Guildford,Farnborough,Farnham).
 Skilled and unskilled workers also    
 find that they have to go out of the  
 village to work.                      
 2.Those who stay and work within the  
 area are shopkeepers,farmers and      
 farmhands,women doing domestic work,  
 and the self-employed.                
 A few people,like teachers,come into  
 the area to work.Opportunity for      
 employment in the village is slight   
 and those without transport are often 
 unable to obtain employment.During    
 summer months the numerous "pick your 
 own "farms provide casual work.       </content>
