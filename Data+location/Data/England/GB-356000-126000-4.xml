		<content>       Babcary has a fairly large area 
 of about four or five acres reserved  
 for a number of sports. The main sport
 played is cricket, and there is also  
 an enclosed tennis-court. There is    
 also a small pavillion, which can be  
 used for children when not in use for 
 cricket.                              
       On one side of the field there  
 is a small children's playground,     
 consisting of four swings and a mound 
 with concrete piping in it, making    
 three tunnels that meet in the middle.
       There are two squash-courts at  
 Hazlegrove House and there is a       
 squash-club to which anyone can join. 
 One can play most evenings, and about 
 a hundred people enjoy squash here.   
       The general public can also use 
 Hazlegrove's Sports Hall: badmington, 
 tennis, and also hockey players enjoy 
 the multi-use hall.                   </content>
