		<content>   L. collected the girls from school  
 at 15.15. J. watched a video film and 
 A. played on her bike while L. made   
 the tea of sausages, new potatoes,    
 peas and sweetcorn. After tea (18.00) 
 the girls played outside while L.     
 washed the pots, brought in the       
 washing, and watched television.      
   At 19.45, G. returned. L. made his  
 tea (as above). At 20.00 the girls    
 came in, watched tv, undressed,       
 washed, brushed hair, had cake and    
 coffee and went to bed at 21.00 after 
 kissing mum and dad.                  
   G. and L. had some coffee, watched  
 tv and talked about the new house     
 before going to bed at midnight.
