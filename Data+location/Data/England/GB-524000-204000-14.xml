		<content>    The BBC Transmitter Station        
 dominates our area.It occupies 64     
 acres of land.It was opened on 14th   
 October 1929. This site was chosen    
 because it is the highest point of    
 land between York and Russia. The     
 station transmits radio signals       
 only.The services transmitted are     
 Radio 1,2,3 and Radio London. The     
 receiving area  extends from          
 Gloucester to Suffolk.                
    The station has masts and          
 towers.The highest mast is 500ft.Masts
 are supported by stay wires.Towers    
 have four legs and are self_          
 supporting.They are expected to last  
 50 years.Ready to assemble tower kits 
 are kept at the station in case of    
 storm damage.                         
    The aerials can be seen from miles 
 around.
