		<content>   Some people get cross with the      
 children because they go to the tip   
 and ride bicycles on the pavement.    
{THE TIP}                              
   To start off with, the tip was a    
 sand quarry. Then they needed         
 somewhere to tip rubbish and this was 
 the only suitable place. The toys that
 they tip encourage children to go up, 
 but they should realise that it is    
 against the law.To stop them signs are
 put up but that doesn't stop many.    
{CYCLING ON THE PAVEMENT}              
   Riding on the pavement protects you 
 from big lorries which create big     
 gusts of wind behind them. This can   
 blow you off your bike. When a lorry  
 goes past to the tip the things come  
 off the back and dust gets in your    
 face. It is bad to ride on the        
 pavements because you could run into  
 an old person and trip them over.     </content>
