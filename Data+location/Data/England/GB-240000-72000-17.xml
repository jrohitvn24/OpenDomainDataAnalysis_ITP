		<content>  Two monuments in the area are bridges
 which span the River Tamar between    
 Devon and Cornwall.  The first is  at 
{Horsebridge}which was built by the    
{Abbot of Tavistock.}This bridge was   
 originally known as the{"Hautes" }    
 bridge because its arches were much   
 higher than its sister bridge at      
 Greystones on the Tavistock to        
 Launceston Road. It has an{unusual    
{feature}in that it has a number of    
{stone brackets twenty feet above the  
{water from which nets used to be hung 
{to catch the salmon.}The abbot was    
 granted an indulgence presumably to   
 collect dues in 1437.The second bridge
 worthy of note is the{New Bridge at   
{Gunnislake which was built by Piers   
{Edgecombe}in the late{1400's/early    
{1500's.}This is part of the A390      
 Tavistock to Callington Road.
