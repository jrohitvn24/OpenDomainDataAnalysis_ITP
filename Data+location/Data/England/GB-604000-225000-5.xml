		<content>    The house was built in{three parts,
 the{back}was built in the{14th        
{century,}the{middle}in the{18th       
{century}and the{front}in the{19th     
{century.}The old part was built with  
 oak beams on the outside, then a      
 cavity was left,and hazel twigs were  
 put vertically with oak strips holding
 them secure with string which had been
 strengthened in candle wax.On top was 
 daub, which is a mixture of straw and 
 clay. The front of the middle section 
 is 50cm.thick. Before{John Osborne    
 arrived{Ardleigh Park}was known as{New
{House;}it was changed to{Ardleigh Park
 because he thought it sounded grander!
    It is surrounded by park land and  
 there are{nearly 100 oak trees}which  
 are{150 years old approx.}We measured 
 one, it took 5 of us to go around it, 
 and the circumference measured        
 7 metres 50cm.                        </content>
