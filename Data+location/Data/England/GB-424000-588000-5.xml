		<title>05THE FORGE</title>
		<content> The forge used to be a Blacksmith's   
 shop where farmers took their horses  
 to be shod. The present tennants have 
 now been living there for 3 years. The
 house was built in the 13th century.  
 It is a 2 bedroomed house with a      
 kitchen and a living room downstairs. 
 The house has very thick walls which  
 help to keep it warm and also includes
 a strip of land by the side of it used
 for gardens.
