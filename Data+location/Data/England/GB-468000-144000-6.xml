		<content> Hampshire is noted for its game       
 shooting and there are several        
 flourishing "shoots" in the study area
 This is mainly pheasant shooting and  
 large numbers of these birds are      
 reared for restocking. Stocks of wild 
 game birds both pheasant and partridge
 have declined greatly since the       
 widespread use of pesticides. Wild and
 feral deer are numerous in the area.  
 The roe are truly wild and have colon-
 ised the area in the last 15-20 years.
 Some wild fallow deer have always been
 present but their numbers have been   
 greatly increased by escapes from     
 private deer parks.Regular culling of 
 both species is necessary to avoid    
 unacceptable damage to forestry and   
 agriculture. This is now done with    
 rifles, the barbarous use of shotguns 
 and snares being largely prohibited.
