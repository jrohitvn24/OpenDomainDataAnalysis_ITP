		<title>04COPPLESTONE CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Copplestone chapel was built in 1831. 
 On the end of the chapel there was a  
 kind of house built. It was used for  
 the preachers before they went to     
 preach. Then another chapel was built 
 opposite the old one. It was built    
 in 1888 and it was made out of Bewsley
 stone. The old chapel was then used as
 a Sunday school until it got in       
 need of repairs and also the Sunday   
 school children were getting too big  
 for the space. Then a new Sunday      
 school was built onto the chapel. When
 the new Sunday school was built the   
 vestry had to be knocked down. There  
 used to be a bell tower over the old  
 vestry. A clock in the tower has      
 now been sold. In 1958 a pipe organ   
 was bought and it replaced the        
 harmonium organ which is now in the   
 Sunday school room. There are about 40
 children and 6 teachers in the School.</content>
