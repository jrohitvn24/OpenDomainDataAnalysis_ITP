		<content>    We interviewed a lady who is 84    
 years old. She came to live in the    
 village when she was married, and has 
{lived there for 63 years.}Her father  
 was born in the village. He had a farm
 before the bungalows were built. He   
 had all the fields which have now been
 built on.                             
    The look of the village has changed
 a lot. It was very small and friendly,
 but now{lots of people have come from 
{outside.}Some of the change has been  
 good. The old barns and derelict      
 buildings have been pulled down. Many 
 cottages have been improved and       
 renovated.                            
    The village becomes noisy at night 
 when young people are on the street   
 corners. Also, people make a noise    
 coming out of the pubs. But still,    
 it's a nice place to live in.
