 We visited 11 separate homes to       
 interview their owners about their    
 lives in Poynton. It is a quiet       
 residential area of bungalows, semi-  
 detached and detached houses. People  
 were not in at some of the houses we  
 went to, they were probably shopping  
 or at work. The average age of the    
 interviewees was 55years. One of the  
 questions asked was: Do you use the   
 local bus service? Most people said   
 no. We think most had cars. We        
 discovered that the average length of 
 time spent living in this area was    
 17years. One old lady had lived there 
 all her life. Most people had children
 but they were at local schools or away
 at college.Another question we asked  
 was: How often do you go away on      
 holiday?Most people said twice a year.</content>
