		<title>12 AYNHO: CANAL &amp; RAILWAYS</title>
		<content>   The {OXFORD CANAL} runs parallel to 
the River Cherwell. It was built in the
18th.century to connect the Thames at  
Oxford to the Midlands. It is a narrow 
canal with many lifting bridges. There 
are 2 locks in Aynho, at Nell Bridge   
and Aynho Weir Lock another which is   
wider to allow for its shallow depth.  
The canal is used by pleasure craft and
there is a boatyard at Aynho Wharf     
where you can hire boats from.         
   There are 2 {RAILWAYS} in Aynho     
which join at Aynho Junction. The older
lower line runs from London(Paddington)
to Birmingham via Oxford and Banbury;  
the newer, higher line runs from London
(Marylebone) to Banbury via High       
Wycombe and Bicester.                  
   There were 2 railway stations:Aynho 
for Deddington on the lower line (the  
building still exists) and Aynho Park  
Halt on the other.Both closed in 1965  </content>
