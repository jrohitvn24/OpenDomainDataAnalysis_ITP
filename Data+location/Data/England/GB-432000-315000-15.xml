		<content>   On waste ground by the Shoulder of  
 Mutton at the turn of the century was 
 a tent which housed the first{MOVING  
{PICTURE SHOW}in Great Britain.Owned by
 Mr Arther Twigden,it comprised a      
 cinematagraph of still pictures       
 flipped over at speed giving the      
 illusion of moving pictures.The       
 cinamatagraph was in turn linked to a 
 gramophone which played in unison with
 the pictures.The whole thing was      
 driven by a steam_engine.             
                                       
   During the '14_'18 war a shop next  
 to Rushdens,owned by Mr Tyler was     
 turned into a soup kitchen.Mr Tyler's 
 monkey was a great attraction.One day 
 the soup was extra_special and        
 declared delicious,but the monkey had 
 gone,not to be seen again.To this day 
 anything missing for no apparent      
 reason is_another"Tyler's Monkey".    </content>
