		<content> A large majority of the houses are    
 council owned.Most people have lived  
 in the area most of their lives moving
 to different houses because of the    
 slum clearance.But because the council
 has been selling off houses recently  
 many people have been buying their    
 homes.Most people who live in the the 
 area do so because of tradition and   
 family connections and there would    
 appear to be a reluctance to move     
 despite the problems created by the   
 decline of heavy industries and the   
 drastic reduction in employment       
 opportunity.Many people like to live  
 around the area because of its quiet  
 natural surroundings,or its proximity 
 to the seaside.Many people do not     
 have garages but the council rent     
 them.Many houses have central heating.
 A large majority have gardens.The     
 older people have meals on wheels.    </content>
