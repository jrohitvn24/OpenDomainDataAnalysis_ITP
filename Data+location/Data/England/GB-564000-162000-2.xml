		<title>02THE CLIMATE OF HARVEL</title>
		<content> Harvel weather feels cold and wet but 
 is considered to be healthy. Mist,    
 rain and sleet are frequent, snow     
 heavy and lying long in bad           
 winters.Late springs and early frosts 
 are the rule.  The general elevation  
 of  between 400 and 600 ft, the high  
 percentage  of tree cover and Holly   
 Hill's prominent position above the   
 Medway Gap suggest a vulnerability    
 to cloud and thunder gathering.       
 Excessive wind exposure is not        
 complained of, perhaps due to shelter 
 from the tree cover.  No data is      
 available but a phone call or trip    
 away often confirms Harvel's extreme  
 conditions.  Spring growth reflects   
 the lower air and ground temperatures 
 normal on  a North slope.  Conditions 
 resemble a Northern county rather than
 the South-East.
