		<title>05Hellifield As I'd Like It</title>
		<content>    Although Hellifield is a nice      
 village, it would be better if we     
 could have a permanent library so that
 we could browse through the books.    
    Everyone would like a sports centre
 with a skating rink, indoor football  
 pitch, table tennis and other games,  
 and a corridor leading to a swimming  
 pool.                                 
    A park would be a good idea with   
 swings, slides and an adventure       
 playground, a special slide and swings
 for the babies, and a quiet area with 
 benches for the old people to rest on.
    Antony would like a lake just      
 outside the village so he could go    
 fishing, and an annual fair with a    
 ghost train, bumper cars and things.  
    More visitors would be attracted by
 a weekly open air market, some nature 
 walks and an attractive restaurant.
