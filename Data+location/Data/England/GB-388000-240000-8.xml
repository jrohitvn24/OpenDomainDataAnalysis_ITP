		<title>08M5 STRENSHAM AREA.</title>
		<content> The{M5 Exeter to Birmingham motorway  
 crosses the area diagonally from North
 to South. Its affect on the area has  
 been considerably. Its has cut through
 the middle of farms, making access to 
 the land difficult.  People who work  
 in such places as Birmingham and      
 Bristol have moved into villages in   
 the area, finding the journey to work 
 quick and easy with the coming of the 
 motorway. Pressure of lorry and       
 holiday traffic has been taken off    
 many villages and small towns.        
 Much of the wild life was probably    
 disturbed by the building of the      
 motorway but kestrels can be seen     
 hovering over the grass verges.       
 Originally the motorway was two lanes 
 only but it is progressively being    
 widened to three lanes - a long term  
 project. There is{one service station}
 in this section at Strensham.         </content>
