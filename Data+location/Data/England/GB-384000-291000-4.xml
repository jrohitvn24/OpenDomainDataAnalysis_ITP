		<title>04The Swimming Pool Experience</title>
		<content> As they arrived at  the turnstile they
identified themselves to the custodian.
The competitors went to the preparation
area,the spectators took up their seats
in the arena. The competitors were seen
to  be apprehensive, the  crowd were in
an expectant  mood. Would their hero be
victorious today?                      
 There were five in the first group.The
small boy was  crying. It was his first
time in the  arena. Would  he be brave?
His arms looked swollen above the elbow
and they were  orange  in colour. Would
he survive the  first wave?  The little
girl beside  him held  his hand. "We're
in this  together Billie. Don't cry."  
 They  were  all cold.  The  spectators
had taken away nearly all the chldren's
clothes. No shoes, no socks,  no woolly
jumpers;  even  their  shirts,  blouses
and vests had gone! What is this?      
 It is their first swimming lesson!!!!!</content>
