		<title>13The Oil Pipeline,Marchwood</title>
		<content> Esso, the oil company,is building a   
 pipeline from Fawley to the Midlands  
 to carry jet fuel.It will pass through
 farmland close to Marchwood.It is     
 costing Â£40 million to build and it   
 will be just 30 centimetres in        
 diameter.It is being laid in a trench 
 two to three metres deep.The          
 complete length will be 210           
 kilometres.                           
         Negotiations between the oil  
 company and local landowners lasted   
 for over two years before the line was
 started.The joints are being tested by
 X-rays because a leak could release   
 thousands of gallons of fuel that     
 could ruin the land for hundreds of   
 years.At the moment the route of the  
 pipeline looks very ugly, but the oil 
 company has promised that when the    
 project is completed,no visible sign  
 of the pipeline will remain.          </content>
