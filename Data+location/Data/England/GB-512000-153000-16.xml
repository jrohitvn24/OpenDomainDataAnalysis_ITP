{Village Day}held in June on the Barn  
 Hall field. Many of the affiliated    
 clubs run stalls, side-shows and      
 competitions. In 1985 Â£3500 was raised
 by Village Day &amp; the entertainments &amp; 
 concerts of Village Week that followed
                                       
 The BCA are the publishers of the     
 local 'Bookhams Bulletin'.            
                                       
 The BCA also founded the Polesden     
 Lacey Open Air Theatre in 1951. The   
 1st production was A Midsummer Nights 
 Dream. The stage was built by volun-  
 teers from Bookham. The Theatre was   
 later handed over to the National     
 Trust, but the BCA still maintain a   
 close interest. In 1985, The Merry    
 Wives of Windsor &amp; The Mikado were    
 performed.
