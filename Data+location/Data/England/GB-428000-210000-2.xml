		<content>The area that we have had to study is  
mainly given over to farming.The river 
Windrush crosses the area from west to 
east and this has had an effect on the 
ariculture of the area.  Around the    
banks of the river the fields are given
over to the growing of grass which, in 
turn is kept for the grazing of cattle.
Some of the grass is kept for silage   
or hay. Further away from the river the
fields are given over to arable crops. 
The most popular seems to be barley and
 oil seed rape. In our area the main   
centre of population is in the village 
of Minster Lovell.
