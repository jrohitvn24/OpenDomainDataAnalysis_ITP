		<title>01An overall view of Bradninch</title>
		<content>  Our D Block is 4km.x 3km. It starts  
 near Waterleat House and finishes near
 Hele Cross. Unfortunately, it does not
 include{Bradninch School.}The majority
 of the town of Bradninch appears in   
 the eastern area. Most of our block   
 consists of farm and grazing ground,  
 much of which belongs to the{Duchy of 
{Cornwall.}The road running through    
 Bradninch used to be a main           
 thoroughfare to the South West but    
 our town is now bypassed by the A381  
 and the{M5 motorway.}These can be     
 clearly seen as can the{River Culm.   
 Our grid is full of rolling hills,    
 wildlife and we are proud to live in  
 such pleasant surroundings. As many of
 us as possible took part in the survey
 and we received marvellous support and
 encouragement from our community.
