		<title>04THE MAIN ROAD</title>
		<content>    The main A.20 from London runs     
 through our block.The{M.20}is not     
 scheduled to be opened until the early
 1990's when it will pass through the  
 southern part of our block.           
    Numerous accidents have happened   
 near our village.Since 1979 there have
 been 1 fatal,10 serious,and 19 slight 
 accidents.There are 0.58 accidents per
 million vehicles a kilometre.The      
 expected rural"A" road rate for       
 accidents is 0.49 per million Vkm.    
 The combined accident rate is higher  
 than the expected rate, but as over   
 half the accidents happened at        
 junctions, the 'link_only' accident   
 rate would be lower than expected.    
    On a one hour traffic count there  
 were 1089 cars, lorries and vans.     
    Most of the villagers are eagerly  
 waiting for the new{M20}motor way to  
 by-pass Lenham and relieve the A20.   </content>
