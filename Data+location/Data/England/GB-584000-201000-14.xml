		<title>14THE EVELEIGH ROOMS PURLEIGH</title>
		<content> The{Eveleigh Rooms},are at the top of 
 the hill opposite Purleigh Church.    
   Originally it was a{school}.In1769  
 the{Rev. Horsmundon}left money to pay 
 a schoolmaster.                       
  {The Rev. Eveleigh}had the school and
 house built in the early 1800's.      
   In{1808}there were 10 boys and 10   
 girls.                                
   In 1915 the head master(Mr.         
 Hathaway),and some of the boys moved  
 the books and equipment down the hill,
 in wheelbarrows,to the new school.    
   After many years as a meeting       
 place and club room,it became unsafe. 
   In early 1985 it was rescued by the 
 Fraul family,who have turned it into a
 house.
