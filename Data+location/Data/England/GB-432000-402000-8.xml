 age they were sent to boarding school 
 and only met one another in the       
 holidays.Mr Elmhirst enjoyed his time 
 at home with his brothers and sisters 
 they would look after rabbits and     
 ferrits,collect caterpillars,ride     
 bikes and go bathing.His father taught
 him to ride,play cricket and make     
 fence posts.He went to school at      
{Winchester College},he says he was a  
 poor scholar so bad at maths that the 
 maths master advised him to bring a   
 good book along to maths lessons and  
 sit at the back.Mr Elmhirst remembers 
 how the headmaster would read out the 
 names of old pupils killed in the war.</content>
