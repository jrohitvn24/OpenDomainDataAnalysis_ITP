		<title>01BURTON HALL FARM</title>
		<content> Burton Hall Farm - this farm is an    
 arable farm of 550 acres.  The land   
 is flat and forms part of the Vale of 
 York.  There is no livestock on this  
 farm and the most important crop is   
 wheat.  The soils are mainly sandy    
 loam, blowing sand and medium loam,   
 which suits wheat.  Sugar beet from   
 the farm is taken to the processing   
 factory at York, potatoes are used for
 crisps, swedes are taken to the       
 wholesale market and oil seed rape    
 and corn are sent to merchants.       
{                                      
 The farm is owned by Mr Huddlestone   
 and is managed by Mr Nicholson.       
                                       
                                       
 There aren't many workers on the farm 
 as much of the work is done by        
 machines.
