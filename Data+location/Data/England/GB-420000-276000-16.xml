		<title>16School Nature Trail</title>
		<content>      In part of the Temple Balsall    
 Vicarage garden, which is next to our 
 school                                
 field,is a wild,overgrown area which  
 Class 3 are turning into a Nature     
 Trail.                                
      We have had a gate put into the  
 fence between the field and the       
 garden, and our first job will be to  
 plan and make a path around the       
 garden,through the bushes and under   
 the trees.                            
      There are various trees          
 there,including a large Yew,Holly and 
 Hawthorn,and also a lot of Snowdrops  
 and Bluebells in the Spring.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
