		<content> Outside toilets were common and often 
 shared with other families. With no   
 bathroom, most people evected a       
 winteridge which was the clothes      
 _horse covered with a blanket. The    
 bath was filled with hot water from   
 the kettle and pans heated over the   
 cooking range. Running hot water is   
 now in all these homes as with toilets
 and bathrooms. The main street had    
 only 15 houses on either side and the 
 road could be deep in mud when it     
 rained. There was,and still is a      
 police sub_station at the bottom of   
 Butt Hill.                            
  Kippax children attended the village 
 school at the top of Leeds Hill built 
 in 1864. Children went to school      
 between 9.00am and 4.00pm, with a     
 lunch break, half an hour longer than 
 we have now.
