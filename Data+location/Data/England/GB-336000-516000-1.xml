		<content> THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA.  GLENRIDDING  
 IS A SMALL COMMUNITY IN THE LAKE      
 DISTRICT SITUATED ON THE SOUTHERN TIP 
 OF LAKE ULLSWATER.   THERE ARE ABOUT  
 300 INHABITANTS, MANY OF WHOM WORK IN 
 THE TOURIST INDUSTRY IN SOME WAY.     
 BECAUSE OF THE SURROUNDING NATURAL    
 BEAUTY OF THE AREA, GLENRIDDING HAS   
 ATTRACTED MANY RETIRED PEOPLE INTO    
 COMING TO LIVE HERE. AWAY FROM YHE    
 COMMUNITY OF GLENRIDDING ITSELF, THERE
 ARE ONLY A VERY FEW SETTLEMENTS, MOST 
 OF WHICH ARE OWNED BY THE NATIONAL    
 TRUST.   MUCH OF THE AREA IS MOUNTAIN 
 AND MORELAND.   PEOPLE HAVE LIVED HERE
 FOR MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS, BUT   
 PROBABLY ONLY IN VERY  SMALL NUMBERS  
 IN THOSE  DAYS.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
