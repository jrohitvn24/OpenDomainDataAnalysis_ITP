		<title>11A.2 Trunk Road - A Busy Road</title>
		<content>   If we didn't have the A.2 it would  
 take us hours to get to London and    
 Dover and the other places it leads   
 to.  Lots of people who live in Kent  
 go to work in London.  Some people    
 travel by train but many go by cars or
 commuter coach.  This makes the road  
 very busy early in the morning and    
 again in the evening when             
 returning home.                       
   Hundreds of heavy lorries use this  
 road which is the main route into     
 London from Dover.  Some are heading  
 for the Dartford Tunnel with access to
 motorways going North.  Many          
 continental coaches use these routes  
 also.  At weekends and holiday times  
 eastbound traffic is heavy to the     
 Kentish resorts and Channel ports.
