 a  Nationwide club. Their main event  
 is the Annual Field day held in May.  
 There are many events, showes and     
 competitions. The sorts of jobs that  
 they do are mainly farming, but some  
 haven't started work yet. They don't  
 have regular meetings and when an     
 event is coming up they have more to  
 talk about at the meetings. At the    
 meetings they have talks and films and
 small slide shows. They enjoy         
 themselves at meetings. The events are
 the Annual Field day, Competetions,   
 Quizes, Soil Assesments, Dress Making 
 and half hour plays.
