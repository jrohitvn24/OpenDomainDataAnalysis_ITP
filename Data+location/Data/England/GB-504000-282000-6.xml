 At the Post Office they are having an 
extension built to make the shop       
bigger. The people who work there are  
Mr. Ron and Mrs. Pat Rutterford.  They 
sell lots of groceries and food and    
they sell some nice little crafts. It  
is called a Post Office because you can
buy stamps to put on your letters or   
parcels to send to your friends. Then  
you can post them in the letter box    
outside. They wanted to buy the Post   
Office because they wanted their own   
business. They are open from           
8am.-1.15pm. &amp; 2pm.-6pm. and are       
closed Wednesday afternoon and Sunday  
all day to have a rest. Mr.            
Rutterford's helper in the shop is     
Miss Sharon Booker. They live in the   
house next door and have a son called  
James who is 15.
