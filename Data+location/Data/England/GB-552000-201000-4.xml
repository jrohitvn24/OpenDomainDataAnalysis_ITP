		<title>04FARMING IN ONGAR</title>
		<content>  There are 13 farms in this area. They
 are mostly about 200 acres on gently  
 sloping land.The highest point in this
 area is 80m above sea level.          
  The fields are of different sizes    
 ranging from 3 or 4 acres to about 40.
 They are still separated with hedges  
 in some farms but there is little     
 woodland on most.                     
 The main crop is usually wheat.       
 Barley, oilseed rape, peas and Durum  
 wheat are grown as well.              
{ Some farmers}are trying to{cut down  
 on the{chemicals}they use for these   
 crops , as they are polluting the     
 nearby rivers. The owners generally   
 employ one or two part-time and       
 full-time workers. Extra workers are  
 employed at harvest time.
