		<title>20Life in Hemlington.</title>
		<content> My family and I live in a link        
 detached house in Axminster Road.  We 
 have a big garden with two apple trees
 in it. Near my house there is a hill. 
 Me and my friends have nicknamed it   
 the Black hill. In my free time I     
 often{ride}up and down the hill on my 
 bike or roller boots. On Friday nights
 I go to{gymnastics}at Acklam Sports   
 Centre. There is a big lake near the  
 shopping centre and I sometimes ride  
 around it on my bike. Around the lake 
 there is a B.M.X. course and a{play   
{park.} There are quite a lot of grass 
 corners where we have picnics in the  
 summer and{snowball fights}in the     
 winter.  I think Hemlington is a good 
 place to live in whatever the weather.
