 Discovery and Cox and these supply    
 fruit throughout the season.He also   
 grows Bramley Seedling cooking apples.
 Also grown are the popular plums      
 Victoria and Marjorie Seedling which  
 he sells on the farm.The trees are    
 very small and so the fruit is easy to
 pick. Some damsons are grown and      
 damascenes,which are very special.They
 were given to the Abbot of Evesham by 
                                       
 the Crusaders on their return from the
 crusades.They brought them in their   
 saddlebags. This fruit was for this   
 reason originally only grown in the   
 Evesham area. It makes an exciting day
 out because there is so much to see   
 and do.
