 but some alternate about their        
 activities.                           
  It is flat in Cambridgeshire so it is
 a quite good area for cycling and     
 crosscountry running.There are lots of
 dykes and lodes so people enjoy       
 walking along them so they are        
 favourite walks.There are lots of     
 facilities like choir,junior guild    
 cycling,walking,fishing,horseriding,  
 cricket and football.                 
  There is not much traffic so it is   
 safe to cycle or walk along the       
 roadside.                             
  There is not much woodland around in 
 Cambridgeshire.
