		<title>04HARTHILL CHURCH REPAIRS</title>
		<content> The church is of red sandstone.       
 The church stone was getting worn away
 the roof timbers were rotting and     
 slatrs needed replacing, the lych gate
 was rotten, the paths were broken, all
 the inside woodwork needed spraying   
 against beetles and the tower needed  
 repairing. There was a team of men;   
 except for the boss, a plumber and a  
 carpenter, the men had been unemployed
 and Manpower Services (countryside and
 recreation) employs them for one year.
 The Church pays only for the          
 materials, actually the owner of      
 Bolesworth Castle gave the money in   
 this case. The men said they quite    
 liked the work and the boss enjoyed it
 very much, they had worked for four   
 months, starting February 1985 and    
 still had more than half to do, it was
 a big job and they did not always know
 what they would find.                 </content>
