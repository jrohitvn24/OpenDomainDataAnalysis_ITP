		<title>04ST MARY'S CHURCH, NEWICK</title>
		<content> Newick's Parish Church of St.Mary     
 dates from Norman times. The oldest   
 part is the South wall, where there is
 a Norman window. The porch dates from 
 about 1400 and the tower was built in 
 the early 15th century. The 13th      
 century chancel was extended about    
 1880. The Parish Registers go back to 
 1558 and the rectors are known from   
 1288.                                 
   St.Mary's is a beautiful old church,
 surrounded by a churchyard full of    
 interesting tombstones, some dating   
 from the 17th century.                
   The Old Rectory, with its Queen Anne
 origins, is no longer used by the     
 rectors of Newick, it being too large 
 and expensive to run.                 
   A project has been started to       
 purchase an old barn and turn it into 
 a Centre for Christianity in Newick.
