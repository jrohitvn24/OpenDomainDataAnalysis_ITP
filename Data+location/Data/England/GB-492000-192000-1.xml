		<title>01Life in the Penn Countryside</title>
		<content> This is an account of the economic and
 social life styles of the inhabitants 
 of the Chepping Parishes of Coleshill,
 Penn and the surrounding villages.    
 Many commuters live in this area,thus 
 there is a high demand for{housing}   
 and property is very expensive.Much of
 the{farmland}is managed on behalf of  
 the owners, many of whom live         
 elsewhere.Farmland is intensively     
 worked for both dairying and beef     
 production.Cottage{industries}are     
 evident on a small scale.There is no  
 heavy &lt;or light> industry in this     
 area.                                 
   The area attracts large numbers of  
{tourists}mainly due to its picturesque
 scenery and its historical fame,      
 notably the Pilgrim Father,William    
 Penn.
