		<title>20An old house - Sheldon Hall</title>
		<content> Sheldon Hall is the oldest building in
 Tile Cross. It was built at the time  
 of Queen Elizabeth I. Most of it has  
 been rebuilt since then. The very     
 first Sheldon Hall was named after    
 Anslen de Scheldon who was the Lord of
 the Manor in 1220. It was a moated    
 manor house. You can still see a small
 part of the moat if you go into the   
 field behind the house. Nobody lives  
 there now. The grounds are overgrown  
 and the house look old and needs      
 painting. People say that the owner is
 going to turn part of the house into a
 squash courts. Some people say it is  
 supposed to be haunted. Children call 
 it Baldy's Mansion.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
