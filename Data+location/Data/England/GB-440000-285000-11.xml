		<title>11A day in school</title>
		<content> When we go into school in the morning 
 we have the registers called and we   
 read for twenty minutes. Sometimes we 
 have the Vicar of Wolvey or the{ARMY} 
 Padre from Bramcote Barracks for      
 assembly on Wednesdays.               
 We have Maths lessons in the morning  
 followed by subjects such as{SCIENCE,}
 French, Physical{EDUCATION}and Music. 
 At 12 o'clock it is dinner time.I do  
 not have a cooked school dinner and so
 I eat sandwiches which my Mum makes   
 for me in the morning. We play in the 
 playground after we have eaten until  
 school lessons begin again at 1.15pm. 
 Sometimes we have cooking and craft in
 the afternoons. On Wednesdays we have{
{GAMES}rounders and athletics in       
 summer,hockey or netball in           
 winter.Boys play football in winter   
 and cricket in summer.                
 At 3.30pm school ends and we go home. </content>
