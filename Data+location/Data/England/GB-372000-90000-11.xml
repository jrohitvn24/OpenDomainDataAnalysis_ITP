		<title>11THE CHURCH</title>
		<content>   On the rebuilding of the church, the
 nave was restored.                    
   The chief interest now lies in the  
 13th century tower.Churches of this   
 early period were often built for     
 emergencies. The parish church was the
 parish castle if the village was      
 attacked.                             
   Previous to the rebuilding of the   
 church, in 1863, was a solidly built  
 structure of about 23 ft in height    
 with a pyramical roof. The only       
 windows were 2 slits.                 
   Communication between the church and
 tower is a small 13th century archway,
 the garrison could retire to the tower
 and barricade this entrance. A narrow 
 slit was widened to be used by        
 archers.
