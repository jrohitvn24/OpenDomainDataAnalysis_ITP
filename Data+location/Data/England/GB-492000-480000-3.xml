		<title>03SURVEY 1871/1985, BROMPTON</title>
		<content> Using the database{QUEST}we had fed   
 into our computer the census return   
 for{BROMPTON 1871}and we spent al lot 
 of time 'finding out' about our       
 village in the 1870's. We thought it  
 would be a good idea to conduct a     
 survey in Brompton in{1985}and to     
 compare it with 1871.                 
  We argued a lot over the sort of     
 questions we would like to ask and the
 questions we ought not to ask people. 
 In the end we decided we were         
 especially interested in people's     
 jobs, how far they travelled to work  
 and where they were born. We could    
 compare jobs and place of birth with  
 1871 and could guess at how far people
 went to work in 1871.                 
   In 1871{99.8%}of the people in      
 Brompton were born in the village or  
 within 3 miles of the village.In 1985 
{30%}were born within 3 miles.         </content>
