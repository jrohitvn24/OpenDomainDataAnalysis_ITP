		<title>14Village life,Ravensthorpe</title>
		<content>My name is Jeffrey I am 8 years old.I  
live in a village called Ravensthorpe. 
It is a nice place because I have lots 
of friends to play with.My street is   
called Church Gardens.I live there     
happily and comfortably.There are 5 in 
my family,their names are Mum,Dad,Helen
Suzanne and me.I have the smallest bed-
room in the house but I do not mind    
because it is just the right size for  
me.I have Mr.Men wallpaper in my room, 
also lots of toys.We have 2 cars- a    
Sunbeam and a Vauxhall Cavalier.We also
have a cat,she has been naughty and    
killed one of the frogs in our pond.My 
sister has a hamster.He is very active 
and scampers all over you.I have a box 
of scalextric and a model train set.I  
like cuddly toys to comfort me in bed  
so I do not have nightmares.I like the 
country and do not want to live in the 
town.                                  </content>
