		<title>09CLUBS AND ENTERTAINMENT 01</title>
		<content> Public Houses are one of the most     
 popular places for entertainment in   
 our area.  People drink mainly beer.  
 There are many different breweries who
 make the beer eg Ansells, M&amp;B,        
 Bathams, Simpkiss, Hansons and        
 Banks's.  Beer drinking is a great    
 pastime.  Games are played in pubs    
 like darts, pool, snooker cards and   
 dominoes.  There may be a juke box for
 those who would rather listen to some 
 music. Clubs such as Liberal, Labour  
 and Conervative clubs are most        
 suitable for young families.  Most    
 Saturday nights there is a disco or a 
 group which  are there to entertain.  
 About halfway through the evening     
 there will be a couple of rounds of   
 bingo for money mad people.  Then     
 after that the disco or group will    
 carry on.  The bar would usually close
 at about 11.30 pm.                    </content>
