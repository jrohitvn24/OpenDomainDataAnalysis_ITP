		<content>                                       
 Bottisham Primary School is 12 years  
 old. It was first opened in January   
 1972.Mr.G.Edwards (Chief Education    
 Officer)opened the building.Mrs.A.    
 Buchanan,Mrs.S.Kirkbride,Mrs.R.Barker 
 and Mrs.J.Philips worked at the school
 when it opened and still work there.  
 There were five classes at first,now  
 there are ten.A new school was built  
 because there were too many children  
 inside.The old school was next to the 
 playing field at the Village College. 
 This new building took 6_8 months to  
 build.The County Architect designed   
 this school.Mrs.Kirkbride likes this  
 school best.In the old school it was  
 so small that small children had to   
 eat in their classrooms.
