		<content>  The jobs available in the area tend  
to be in garages or shops such as the  
Coop or Stars Newsagents.  25% of the  
5th formers wish to remain at school.  
25% of these wish to stay on for one   
year.  The remainder will take higher  
qualifications such as Advanced        
levels.                                
  Rising Brook has a good reputation   
for supplying the labour market with   
employees who have good logical views. 
Each year 7-10% enter for University or
Polytechnic places.                    
  The boys at the school are more      
likely to gain employment than the     
girls and this has been the case for   
many years.  The majority of boys go in
for Technical Apprenticships in the    
army or some craft employment.
