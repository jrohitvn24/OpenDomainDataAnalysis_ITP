		<title>15FROZEN FISH DEPOT, LONG ROCK</title>
		<content> Much of the fish caught locally and   
 brought ashore at Newlyn goes to      
 Shippams Cannery. It is gutted and    
 cut to size, then brought by lorry to 
 the large store at Long Rock where    
 only two staff are needed. Here it    
 is frozen into slabs at a temperature 
 of _30 C. The process takes 1 hour and
 55 minutes. Then the frozen slabs of  
 fish are boxed, labelled and stored in
 a huge freezer room. They may remain  
 here for up to a year. When needed the
 frozen crabmeat, mackerel and         
 pilchards are defrosted and taken back
 to the cannery at Newlyn. They are    
 thawed and put into tins ready for    
 sale. Off-cuts of fish, and white     
 fish are sent to Shippams factory in  
 Chichester to be made into fish paste.
