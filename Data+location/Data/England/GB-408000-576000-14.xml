		<title>14GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content>   These are the games which we most   
 enjoy playing at playtime. They are   
 called{Stick-in-the-mud, Hop-Scotch   
{Chasey, Trains, The Farmer's in his   
{Den and Ring a Ring of Roses.}The     
 older children play{Stick-in-the-mud  
 and{Hop-Scotch}and we play{The        
{Farmer's in his Den and Ring a Ring of
{Roses}with the younger children.      
   In{Stick-in-the-mud}you choose      
 someone to be "on" and if you're "on" 
 you chase people. If you are caught   
 you stand with your legs apart until  
 someone crawls between your legs and  
 frees you to run again.               
   We have a{Hop-Scotch}pattern on the 
 yard. It is marked in numbers 1 to 10.
 To play it properly you get a stone   
 and throw it on to number 1. If it    
 lands on the line you miss a go. The  
 first person to get to 10 wins.
