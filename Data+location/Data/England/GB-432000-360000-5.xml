		<content> Townspeople will find it hard to      
 imagine a house where there is no gas,
 mains water or sewage.This is true of 
 some of the farms in this area.People 
 without mains sewage have cess-pits   
 which are huge tanks underground,that 
 are emptied at intervals by the       
 council workmen.Everyone has          
 electricity and one farm has a        
 wind-pump too.Some farms have their   
 own spring water supply or a bore     
 hole,and in these days, when spring   
 water is costly and advertised as     
 something tasty and special,without   
 any additives,perhaps we should envy  
 the ones who have their own           
 supply.Don't think this portrays a    
 primitive lifestyle.Kitchens are      
 spacious,with modern fitments.Many    
 people said they were happy to live   
 away from the bustle of the towns.
