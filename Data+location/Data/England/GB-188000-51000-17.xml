		<content> I have been asking people about their 
 reasons for moving to Cornwall and    
 living in the country. My results look
 like this:                            
                                       
{- The most important reason was the   
{  peace and quiet. People thought that
{  the cities they had come from were  
{  too noisy and busy.                 
                                       
 - They felt that the country air was  
   healthier and that the pace of life 
   was slower and better for them.     
                                       
{- They said that it was easier to get 
{  to know people in the country than  
{  it was in the cities.               
                                       
 - They said that the climate was      
   better than farther up the country  
   and that they liked going to the    
   beach and walking in the country.   </content>
