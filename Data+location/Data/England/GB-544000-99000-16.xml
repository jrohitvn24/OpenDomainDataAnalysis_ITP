		<title>16NEWHAVEN TRADITIONAL CUSTOMS</title>
		<content> Newhaven has many local customs and   
 traditions, continued for their own   
 value and to raise money for charity. 
 The post of Seaford Town Crier, dating
 from time immemorial, has been held by
 Peter White since 1977.  Dressed in   
 tricorn hat, knee britches and stock, 
 carrying bell and scroll, Mr. White   
 regularly cries the traditional "Oyez"
 (meaning "listen") in Seaford and     
 Newhaven, announcing charitable       
 events.  Newhaven Carnival Society    
 holds an annual Firework Display and  
 costumed procession by torchlight, a  
 most impressive event, raising money  
 for local charities.  Another         
 charitable custom is the Raft Race    
 held each spring when home-made rafts 
 race down the Ouse from Lewes to      
 Newhaven.  The ceremony, in memory of 
 the tragic 1942 Dieppe Raid, is an    
 annual commemoration service.         </content>
