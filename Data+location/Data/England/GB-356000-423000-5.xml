 MY NAME IS YVONNE JEFFREY AND I LIVE  
 AT 51 LANGDEN CRESCENT, BAMBER BRIDGE.
 I HAVE TWO DOGS - ONE IS A MONGREL    
 WHOSE NAME IS 'SANDY' AND SHE IS ABOUT
 SEVEN YEARS OLD. THE OTHER IS A       
 YORKSHIRE TERRIER CALLED 'PIP' AND HE 
 IS TWELVE MONTHS OLD. MY BROTHER ALSO 
 HAS A DOG OF HIS OWN AND WE HAVE TWO  
 TERRAPINS AND A TANKFUL OF FISH. WHEN 
 MY MUM WAS YOUNG SHE HAD A BLACK      
 MONGREL CALLED 'WHISKY'.  SOME PEOPLE 
 HAVE UNUSUAL PETS SUCH AS             
 SNAKES,LIZARDS AND EVEN GOLDFISH WE   
 DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND FIND
 DOGS BETTER PETS AND EASIER TO LOOK   
 AFTER. IF YOU GIVE A DOG A LOT OF     
 AFFECTION AND PLENTY OF EXERCISE, HE  
 WILL REPAY YOU TENFOLD AND BE A GOOD  
 COMPANION FOR YOU ALL OF HIS LIFE. WE 
 LOVE OUR DOGS VERY MUCH AND KNOW THAT 
 THEY LOVE US.                         </content>
