		<content>Family ties are very strong, and when  
children grow up they often remain in  
the area near to the parental home.    
Farmers and their families still tend  
to eat the main meal in the middle of  
the day, with a high tea or supper in  
the evening. Commuters largely have    
their main meal at night after         
returning from work. The standard of   
food is very high, with emphasis on    
home produce, milk and eggs. As most   
farmers wifes have to cater for heavy  
workers, the meals are very substantial
and nourishing. Pride is taken in      
cooking skills.                        
Living standards are high, and most    
farmhouses and private houses are well 
and tastefully furnished. Usually the  
decor is in keeping with the type of   
house occupied.
