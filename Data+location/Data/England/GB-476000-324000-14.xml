		<title>14My Dad Commutes - My Day</title>
		<content> At 7.30am my dad wakes me with my     
 breakfast.He then leaves in his car to
 travel to Leicester where he works as 
 a systems manager.                    
    My mum makes sure I am dressed     
 before she leaves in her car to travel
 to Colsterworth in Lincolnshire where 
 she teaches.My elder sister and       
 brother are next to leave to catch    
 their bus to their secondary schools  
 in Melton Mowbray. I am last to leave 
 at 8.30am because my primary school is
 in the village.                       
    I am first home just after 3.30pm, 
 quickly followed by my sister and     
 brother.My mum gets our tea when she  
 gets home at 5.00pm.My dad gets home  
 at 6.30pm and his tea is usually cold.
 I usually play out with my friends in 
 the village till it goes dark and then
 I watch the TV till my mum tells me to
 go to bed.                            </content>
