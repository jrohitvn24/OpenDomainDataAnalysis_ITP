		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I am a boy aged 11 living on my       
 father's 250 acre farm on the{Wenlock 
{Edge,}called the Fegg Farm. In the    
 holidays my day usually starts at 7am 
 and before breakfast,which is at 8am. 
 I help my father feed the fattening   
 cattle with rolled barley and minerals
 added to it.After breakfast we go for 
 a walk round the rest of the stock to 
 check that they are all fit and well  
 and within bounds.We see that some of 
 the cattle have been getting out in to
 the next field.My father says we must 
 go and patch up the hole in the fence 
 so we return to the{farm}to collect   
 the fencing equipment.After this we   
 decide it is time for a cup of coffee.
 while we are drinking it my friend    
 phones up to ask if he can come and   
 play after lunch.He arrives about 2pm 
 and we go out into the garden to play.
