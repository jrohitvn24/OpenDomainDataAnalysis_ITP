  We telephoned the manager at the     
 Sport's Centre and asked him a few    
 questions about the Sport's Centre.   
 We asked him when it was built and he 
 said 1967. We asked him why they had  
 to modernise it and he told us it was 
 in a very bad state of repair. We     
 asked him how many staff worked for   
 him and he said about 70. He told us  
 that the Centre was 18years old now,  
 and that the most popular sport there 
 was swimming. There are 20 to 25 other
 different sports organised, and people
 travel from all around the area to    
 take part in these. Some of the other 
 sports are badminton, squash, judo,   
 gymnastics, five a side football and  
 keep fit.
