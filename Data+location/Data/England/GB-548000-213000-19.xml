		<title>19Attitudes about Stansted.</title>
		<content> In the summer of 1985 the major topic 
 of conversation in Sheering is the    
 planned development of{Stansted       
{Airport}to be London'S Third          
 Airport.                              
 Most people in Sheering are not in    
 favour of this development.People     
 think that there will be too much     
{noise}from the planes,especially in   
 Lower Sheering.They also are worried  
 about the{traffic                     
 increasing,especially in the Main     
 Street.The Parish Council is further  
 concerned that Harlow might expand its
 population to 130,000 and begin       
 building on Sheering's land.          
 A few people are in favour of the     
 development of Stansted               
 Airport,because they think the airport
 will bring more{jobs}and the price of 
 housing will rise,perhaps by 20%.
