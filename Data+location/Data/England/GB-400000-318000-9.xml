		<content>The 2nd Rugeley Cub Pack holds its     
meeting every Tuesday at Hillsprings   
Community Centre from 6.00pm to 7.45pm.
We have a pack of 30 cubs aged between 
8 and 11 years. They take part in      
plenty of outdoor activities. In the   
last 12 months we have taken the cubs  
to London and there we visited the     
Imperial War Museum and after we went  
aboard H.M.S.Belfast which was on the  
River Thames. In the Summer the cubs   
hadan outdoor camp at Beaudesert Camp  
on part of Cannock Chase for the       
weekend. A Winter's camp was held in   
February at Drum Hill in Derby. It was 
an indoor camp and all the cubs        
achieved their Artist Badge that       
weekend. In June the cubs went again to
Beaudesert Camp for a weekend. The cubs
also take part in District Competitions
Athletics, Cooking, Handicraft an      
Intersix Quiz and have a football team.</content>
