		<title>05RIVER TRENT</title>
		<content> THE RIVER TRENT  Since the Middle Ages
 the only way to cross the river at    
 Gainsborough was by ferry.In 1791 the 
 Trent Bridge,designed by William      
 Weston was opened for traffic,at a    
 cost of Â£10,000.All persons and       
 vehicles using the bridge had to pay  
 tolls until 1931 when Lindsey county  
 council bought the bridge for Â£130,000
 and the collection of tolls ceased.The
 bridge has 3 arches but river traffic 
 must use the centre arch.Barges       
 carrying sand,gravel or grain,and     
 pleasure boats form the main river    
 traffic.                              
 THE EAGRE  is the famous tidal wave   
 which comes up  the River Trent from  
 the Humber Estuary.It can be seen in  
 June and July.The Eagre is between one
 and two metres high when it reaches   
 the Trent Bridge at Gainsborough where
 it breaks up.                         </content>
