		<content>{Recreation(cont.)_}The large{sports   
{hall}of Downend Upper School is       
 available for community use. There are
 facilities for playing{badminton,     
{squash,table tennis,indoor hockey,    
{5-a-side football, basketball, netball
{and other indoor activities.          
     {Bitterwell Lake}and the{River    
{Frome}are coarse{fishing}venues for   
 anglers. Local opinion has it that the
 lake offers the better sport.         
      The{River Frome}brings the       
 country-side into the urban outskirts.
 The{Frome Valley Walkway}follows the  
 river's course for several miles and  
 provides an excellent opportunity to  
 experience the tranquility and ecology
 of a river bank environment within    
 easy walking distance of residential  
 developments. It is one of the few    
 amenities within the area that acts as
 an attraction for{tourists.           </content>
