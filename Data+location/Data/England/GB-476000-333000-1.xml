		<title>01Plungar Barkestone Redmile</title>
		<content>{   The villages are each approximately
 a mile apart,with Barkestone being the
 central one.The area is largely       
 agricultural though in recent years   
 some commuters now live in the        
 villages and travel to nearby         
 Nottingham Newark or Grantham and some
 to London.                            
  As they are not on a main route      
 linking towns each has a quiet charm  
 of last century though living         
 standards are modern.All main services
 are available except gas and each     
 village has post office services      
 public houses shops and churches.     
  The roads are quiet except for farm  
 vehicles during the day and in the    
 winter or wet weather they are often  
 very muddy.                           
  Several people were born in the      
 villages where they still live and    
 have relatives nearby.                </content>
