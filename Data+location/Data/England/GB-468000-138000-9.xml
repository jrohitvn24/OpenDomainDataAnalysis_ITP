		<content>    My Mum has a  Vauxhall Carlton     
 estate and my Dad has got a B.M.W.    
 323i. Every Saturday in town I buy a  
 science fiction comic called 2000 A.D.
 and some sweets but I don't really    
 have a favourite though.              
    When I get back I would have my    
 lunch which would be at about 1.00p.m.
 After that I would call on a friend or
 play football, or some other sport    
 that I could play on my own. After    
 that I might play on our computer.    
   By then it would be supper time and 
 I would have it watching the          
 television. After that I would go to  
 bed at around 10.00p.m.,get undressed,
 clean my teeth, switch the light out  
 and go to bed.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
