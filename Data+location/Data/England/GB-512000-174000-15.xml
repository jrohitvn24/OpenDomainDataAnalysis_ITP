		<title>15HOUNSLOW HEATH</title>
		<content> Hounslow Heath has a rich history. It 
 has seen{highwaymen}like{Dick Turpin, 
 a long-standing{army presence}and     
{London's first airport.}We tried to   
 discover how it is used in 1985; we   
 found a variety of uses.              
 There was a rumour in school that part
 of it was a{secret anti-terrorist     
 training area.  When we investigated, 
 we found a fenced-off area looking    
 like a film set: house fronts, empty  
 buildings and a full-size plane. In   
 fact it is a{Metropolitan Police      
{training centre,}used to train        
 constables in the sort of situation   
 they meet working around London.      
 The Heath is a big open area, mostly  
{grassland}but with a few trees and    
 bushes. It is{mostly flat,}with a few 
 dips. There are also some{ponds}and   
{wet areas.                            
                                       </content>
