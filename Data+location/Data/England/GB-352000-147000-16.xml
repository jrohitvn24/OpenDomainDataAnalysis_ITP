		<title>16MEMORIES OF WOOKEY HOLE (2)</title>
		<content>  AT ONE TIME, WOOKEY HOLE HAD ITS OWN 
 PARK, AS A PIECE OF LAND WAS GIVEN BY 
 THE MILL OWNER IN CELEBRATION OF THE  
 KING GEORGE V1 CORORATION. UNHAPPILY, 
 THE LAND REVERTED TO ITS FORMER OWNER 
 ON HIS DEATH, AND THERE HAD BEEN      
 PROBLEMS OVER THE VOLUNTARY UPKEEP OF 
 CORONATION PARK BY THE VILLAGERS.     
  ONE ELDERLY RESIDENT CONSIDERS THAT  
 THE GREATEST CHANGE OVER THE YEARS HAS
 BEEN THE REDUCTION OF ACTIVITIES IN   
 WOOKEY HOLE AREA, WHICH USED TO       
 SUPPORT ITS OWN CHOIR, FOOTBALL TEAM  
 AND CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL FROM LARGE 
 FAMILIES OF THE TIME.                 
  SHE WELL REMEMBERS CORONATION        
 DAY,12th MAY 1937, WHEN HER HOUSE WAS 
 GAILY DECORATED WITH FLAGS AND        
 BUNTING, AND A THANKSGIVING SERVICE,  
 CHILDRENS' SPORTS,TEA PARTY AND A     
 GRAND SOCIAL IN THE EVENING AT THE    
 VILLAGE CLUB.                         </content>
