		<title>03RESERVOIRS IN CHINGFORD</title>
		<content>   There used to be several farms in   
 Chingford but the land has been built 
 on now.One farmhouse has been         
 developed as a pub -{the Larkswood}.  
   Sheep,however are still to be found 
 in Chingford.They together with some  
 horses,graze around the reservoir.The 
 reservoir in our area is called the   
{William Girling reservoir}.Areservoir 
 is a large pool of water.The water we 
 use in our homes comes from the       
 reservoir,which is owned by Thames    
 Water Authority.The reservoir is very 
 deep because it has to give water to  
 the whole of Chingford.There is a     
 fence around it so people don't fall  
 in!There are walls to prevent waves   
 forming.The reservoir is about a 1/4  
 of a mile square.There is a boating   
 club near where club members sail.    
 Wind-surfing,water-skiing and board-  
 sailing also take place.              </content>
