		<content>{Q. Is the church a tourist attraction?
 A. Yes. It is built on a very ancient 
 site where it is said St. Paulinus    
 baptised the first Christians in the  
 year 627 in the beck. Later, a wooden 
 church may have been built, and then a
 stone church. The present building is 
 post Norman. It's a major building,   
 one of the larger churches in this    
 part of Yorkshire.                    
{Q. Can you tell me something about the
{Church Restoration Appeal?}           
 A. The shell of the church building is
 in a very poor state and is           
 deteriorating all the time. We've got 
 three leaks in the roof, repairs will 
 cost about Â£20,000. The stonework is  
 weathering very badly and in some     
 places it's just crumbling away. The  
 Appeal Committee under the direction  
 of Mr. Sands organises fund raising   
 for the appeal.                       </content>
