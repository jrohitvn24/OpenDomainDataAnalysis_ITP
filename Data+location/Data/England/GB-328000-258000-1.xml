		<content> This block is fairly rural mixed      
 farming, sheep, cattle some corn and  
 hay crops.                            
                                       
 The local kennels have a good pack and
 hunt Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays   
 during the seson.  Trout in the river 
 private fishing, Eywood Pool a quiet  
 bird sanctuary.                       
                                       
 Not many young people live here, more 
 retired people most of the houses are 
 privately owned.                      
                                       
 The post office only opens 2          
 afternoons a week and the only small  
 shop, closes endd of 1985. There is   
 only 1 bus service to Kington on a    
 Tuesday. The churchyard ws awrded 2nd 
 prize in a recent competition, the    
 running of the Church is not happy    
 among some of the older parishoners   </content>
