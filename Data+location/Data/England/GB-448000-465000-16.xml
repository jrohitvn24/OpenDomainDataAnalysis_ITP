 out of bed and got dressed and combed 
 my hair. I had a wash and brushed my  
 teeth.I went downstairs and had some  
 Honey Smacks for my breakfast.I put my
 shoes on and had my hair tied up .I   
 put my coat and bag on and went to    
 school.At school I did some maths     
 afterwards we had assembly.Then it    
 was playtime so I stayed in and played
 my recorder.When playtime was over I  
 went on to Space_ex a computer
