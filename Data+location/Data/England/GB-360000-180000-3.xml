		<title>03NEW HOUSES-STOKE GIFFORD</title>
		<content>   There is a great variety of housing 
 in each road,most of the houses are   
 semi and detached. All the houses have
 at least one garage. The estate has   
 340 houses at present but a lot       
 more are being built.                 
   Many occupants complain that there  
 are not enough facilities for such a  
 big estate as there is only one post  
 office,two pubs, a solicitors and a   
 garage. It is said that a supermarket 
 will be built.                        
   Most people have moved from other   
 parts of Bristol and were previous    
 house owners. Many have moved in      
 search of a bigger,newer house and    
 more pleasant surroundings.           
   Mothers like the area because it is 
 safe for children to play but are     
 worried because small children have a 
 long way to travel to primary school.
