		<content> The village of Okeford Fitzpaine is   
 lucky to have a large number of       
 picturesque old cottages dating back  
 to the 18th century and beyond.       
 However, it also has a large estate,  
 built in the 1930's and 1950's, which 
 provides housing for young families   
 and those on lower incomes.           
 There is a new housing estate of about
 14 homes, built in 1985,which have    
 been designed as family housing. There
 are plans for further small           
 developments of this type.            
                                       
 Unfortunately, young people are being 
 forced away from the village because  
 of the difficulty in finding suitable 
 accommodation, while the area has     
 increased in its popularity for       
 retirement housing.
