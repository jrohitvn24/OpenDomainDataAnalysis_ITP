		<content>   BERROW BEACH LIES NORTH AND SOUTH ON
THE EAST COAST OF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL. 
THE BEACH IS FLAT AND SANDY BACKED BY  
SAND DUNES AND FRONTED BY MUD FLATS.   
ACCESS IS BY A ROAD OFF THE COAST ROAD.
   THE NORTHERN 2KM AND THE SOUTHERN   
1KM ARE OPEN TO VEHICLES.BETWEEN THESE 
TWO AREAS THERE IS A VEHICLE FREE AREA.
   IN COMMON WITH ALL BRISTOL CHANNEL  
RESORTS,THERE IS A LARGE TIDAL RANGE.  
WHEN THE TIDE IS IN,THERE IS A GOOD    
SAFE SEA BATHING.AT LOW TIDE,THE MUD   
FLATS CAN BE DANGEROUS.                
   THE SAND DUNES HAVE BEEN ERODED BY  
VISITORS AND WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO     
PREVENT CARS BEING DRIVEN INTO THE     
DUNES.THE DUNES HAVE WOODEN FENCING TO 
ENCOURAGE THE BUILD UP OF THE SAND,THIS
IS PROVING TO BE A SUCCESS.
