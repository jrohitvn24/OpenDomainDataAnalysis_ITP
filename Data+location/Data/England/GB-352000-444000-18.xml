		<content> We go each year on a weekend visit to 
 an interesting place, usually staying 
 at a Youth Hostel, and meet frequently
 with other small schools in this area.
 There is a School Association which   
 organises various social and          
 fund-raising activities, whilst each  
 Wednesday afternoon we hold a Mother  
 and Toddler Club for our pre-school   
 children. This has now been running   
 for over two years.                   
 Other activities in which we are      
 involved are: Chess Club, Church      
 celebrations and festivals, and       
 visiting theatre groups.              
 There are two full-time teachers at   
 the school plus a part-time teacher   
 who comes in on two mornings each     
 week.                                 
 We have a playground and a playing    
 field from which we can see all the   
 way to the coast at Blackpool.        </content>
