		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>   This is an area of gently undulating
 relief,with no steep slopes or high   
 land.  Most of the land is used for   
 intensive arable farming, particularly
 for growing cereals and sugar beet.   
 The farming is highly mechanised.     
   Blofield is the main settlement in  
 the area and is a moderate sized      
 village.  It is an old village with a 
 church,2 pubs, a primary school and   
 several shops.  Blofield Heath and    
 Hemblington Corner in the north of the
 area are smaller villages which have  
 grown together.  All these villages   
 have grown over recent years with new 
 eststes being built for people to live
 in, who commute to work in Norwich.   
   The A 47, the Norwich to Great      
 Yarmouth road runs through the area,  
 though a by_pass has been built around
 Blofield.
