 green fields. A long red sandstone    
 ridge dominates the area, along it    
 runs the Sandstone Trail. It has some 
 pine plantation on the slopes, these  
 and other groups of trees contribute  
 to the varied and interesting views in
 all directions. Two small villages, a 
 few farmhouses, Bolesworth Castle and 
 a few public houses comprise the      
 buildings.The two villages are called 
 Harthill and Burwardsley. Harthill has
 a church and Harthill County Primary  
 School, a village school. Burwardsley 
 comprises several houses,a church,a   
 chapel, two workshops and a Post

 hedgerows. Cattle and wildlife are    
 plentiful.The majority of fields are  
 used as grazing land.                 </content>
