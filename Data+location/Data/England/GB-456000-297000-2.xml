		<title>02Hall Farm/Blaby.</title>
		<content> Mr.&amp; Mrs.{Norman Wells }have been     
 farming at{Hall Farm }for 19 yrs.There
 are 85 acres in Blaby and 65 acres    
 scattered elsewhere.The land is mostly
 down to grass for grazing, hay and    
 silage-making.35 acres of barley are  
 grown for cattle-feed.                
 There are 65 milking cows and 63      
 growing calves.The cows are black and 
 white Fresians,although there is one  
 "red" and white Fresian cow.          
{Hall Farm}is the only farm left which 
 is actually in the village of{Blaby,} 
 although there are two or three in the
 parish.                               
 Being on the urban fringe presents    
 problems through trespass and         
 vandalism.In 1984 a barn and its hay  
 was lost in a fire- possible cause,a  
 firework.{Mr. and Mrs. Wells}have a   
 son working on the farm who may follow
 them into the farming business.       </content>
