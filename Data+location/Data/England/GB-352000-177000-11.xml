		<title>11THE TIP AREA - Part 1</title>
		<content>    The Tip Area is behind Saltmarsh   
 Drive. Often Gypsies are found there. 
 The area is full of mud, probably     
 because at one time Saltmarsh Drive   
 was marshland. It runs the full length
 (and more) of Saltmarsh Drive. The tip
 finishes at Kingsweston Lane. There is
 a poultry farm by the side of the tip.
 The farm is open on Sundays for horse 
 riding.                               
    Young people from all over Bristol 
 come and scramble on the mud with     
 their scrambling bikes. But soon the  
 tip is to become a BMX racing track.  
    Most people think the area is a    
 disgrace, and it should have been     
 cleared up ages ago.                  
    There is a rhine separating the two
 sides of the tip. The rhine contains  
 oil, rats and rubbish. Sometimes you  
 can even see cars and bikes. Scrap    
 pieces of metal are often found.{cont.</content>
