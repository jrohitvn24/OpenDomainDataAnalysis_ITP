		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ALICIA.</title>
		<content> My mum has to wake me up in the       
 mornings at 8 o'clock.Then I have     
 cocopops for breakfast.Mum takes me to
 school in her car.She leaves me at the
 lollipop man.When the bell goes I line
 up and the teacher lets us inside if  
 we are quiet and still and the line is
 straight.We go to assembly and we     
 sometimes have a story and a song.    
 Afterwards we do handwriting then     
 maths.After first play we finish our  
 maths.Dinner is at 12.00.Today it was 
 beefburgers and chips.We go out to    
 play but some children go for violin  
 lessons.In the afternoon we learn     
 about worms and our teacher reads a   
 story.Mum takes me home and I play    
 until 6.00.We have tea and then I feed
 my rabbit,dog and hamster.Mum puts me 
 to bed and I read five stories before 
 I go to sleep.                        
                                       </content>
