		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO CIRENCESTER</title>
		<content> Cirencester is an important centre for
 tourism occupying a central location  
 on the Cotswolds. There is a twice    
 weekly market held on the Medieval    
 Market Place and the many good hotels,
 restaurants and shops give a general  
 impression of prosperity. Yet here as 
 elsewhere in the country there exists 
 unemployment and social need          
 particularly amongst the  unskilled   
 workers.                              
 There are 3 large supermarkets, a     
 department store and a range of small 
 shops which provide an important      
 facility for the hamlets and villages 
 around Cirencester. The town has grown
 rapidly over the past decade          
 especially in light industry and      
 housing. House prices range from      
 Â£30,000 to Â£70,000. Many people       
 commute to Swindon to  work.
