 hobbies and we make up games.         
                                       
 ICE-CREAM-----1person is "Ice-cream", 
 when she turns her back everyone runs 
 forward.When she turns around you     
 stand still.If she sees you ,you go   
 back to start.If you get there you are
 "Ice-cream".                          
 MOTHER MAY I-----1person is Mother,the
 other chidren are days of the week.If 
 "Mother" says"Tuesday take 3 giant    
 steps" then "Tuesday" does.The first  
 to get to "Mother" is the new "Mother"
 List of actions::Curly wurly--jump and
 turn.   Fast train to London--run.    
 Pigeon--take half steps.              
 WEMBLEY-----A goalkeeper stands in    
 goal,players kick the ball around and
