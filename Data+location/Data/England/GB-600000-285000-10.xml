		<content> In{Georgian}times the common fields   
 were enclosed to make more productive 
 units, and former agricultural workers
 migrated to the larger towns for work.
 In{Victorian}times it is recorded that
 in Kenninghall village there was a    
 large weekly market held every Monday 
 and two annual fairs for cattle and   
 sheep.There was also the Guiltcross   
 Union{Workhouse}for the unfortunates  
 of the village.                       
 In more{recent times}the First World  
 War resulted in many of the menfolk of
 the village being killed and virtually
 a whole generation was lost. This     
 affected the agricultural labour      
 market and increased the drive for    
 mechanisation.Kenninghall has changed 
 very little in the last seventy years.
