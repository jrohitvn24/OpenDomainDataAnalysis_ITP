		<title>07FIELD PATTERNS</title>
		<content>   The fields are very large and in    
 recent years many hedges have been    
 removed to allow the use of tractors  
 and large agricultural machinery.     
   Although the land is very flat, many
 of the fields are strange shapes. This
 is often caused by the boundaries     
 being old creeks from the time when   
 the land was salt marsh.              
   As for the roads, in the olden days 
 cattle were driven to the marsh to    
 feed. They wandered in wiggly lines   
 and this may account for the road     
 pattern.                              
   As we walked around our area we     
 noticed that many fields on the 6" map
 had ponds marked. These no longer     
 existed because now that horses are   
 not used there is no need to provide  
 them with drinking water.             
   Being low lying, many of the fields 
 are bordered by dykes, for drainage.  </content>
