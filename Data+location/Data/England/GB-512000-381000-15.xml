		<title>15FARMING</title>
		<content>    One farmer has tried growing crops 
{organically.}A 20 acre field, which   
 had been unimproved pasture, and      
 therefore had no residual chemicals in
 the soil, was ploughed and carried a  
 wheat crop in 1985. No chemical sprays
 or fertilizers were used on it. The   
 quality of the crop was greatly       
 impaired by the weather in August and 
 September, but it showed sufficient   
 promise for the farmer to use the same
 land for oats in 1986. Because        
 chemical weed killers cannot be used, 
 the land must be cultivated in the    
 spring to destroy weed seedlings, so  
 the oats will be spring, not autumn   
 sown. The crop will be sold for use as
 muesli.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
