		<title>12OAKLEY NATURE TRAIL</title>
		<content>{You could tell it was old because it  
{was very crumbly.  It had little holes
{so it had woodworm.  There was a kind 
{of powder inside with some little     
{things like flies under it.  I found a
{log which looked like a horse foot.   
{It is 150 years old.  I counted the   
{rings.  I did a bark rubbing.  The    
{bark was green, yellow, black and     
{brown.  In the magnifying glass I saw 
{woodlice cases.  Spiders eat insects  
{like woodlice.  Shane gave me a thing 
{that a wasp made.  It is like a rotten
{apple.  I got stung by a stinging     
{nettle.  The good thing about stinging
{nettles is butterflies lay their eggs 
{on them.  We saw fungus on trees and  
{toadstools.  One of them was smaller  
{than my little finger. }Plans for     
 Oakley include a permanent camping    
 area, adventure playground, swimming  
 pool and Youth Hostel.                </content>
