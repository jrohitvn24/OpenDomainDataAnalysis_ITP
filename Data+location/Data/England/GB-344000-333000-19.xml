		<content> LYNEAL VILLAGE by Helen Marshall      
 (extracted from a piece of writing)   
                                       
 "The stackyard's Dutch barn had a     
 corrugated iron roof bent into a      
 curve. Parallel were the lines on the 
 roof. A truss held up a beam at the   
 end. It had no sides.                 
 We walked on and soon came to a very  
 interesting stone wall.               
 Colours: rich browns merged with ivy  
 coloured moss. Deep greens lurked in  
 the shadows and crevices deep.        
 Sizes were none the same;big,little,  
 fat and slim,round, rough and smooth. 
 Texturally, the stones were like dogs'
 noses, sharp and jagged, bumpy and    
 dipping."
