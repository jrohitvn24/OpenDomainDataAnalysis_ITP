		<content> Rodmore Mill was built in{1629.       
 It hasn't been running since{1881.    
 The owner is Mrs Dorothy Cook.        
 Before it was a mill it was a{forge.  
 The land is used for grazing.         
 They have{16 acres}of land and{4      
{fields.}They have some cows but mostly
 sheep.The mill is four storeys high   
 and used to make brown and white      
 paper.The mill is made of solid       
 stone and now it is falling down.     
 Round the back of the mill there is   
 the remains of a pond.There were{ten  
{fireplaces}which were used for drying 
 the corn.There was a pipe which led   
 into the pond round the back of the   
 mill. The water went through the pipe 
 and on to the wheel and made it go    
 round.The mill is on the{Cone Brook.
