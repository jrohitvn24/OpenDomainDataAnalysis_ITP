		<content>  My particular thanks are due to Mr.  
 and Mrs A. Grigor of West Chiltington.
 Their knowledge of the area dates back
 to the 1880s when Mrs Grigor's family,
 the Lerwills, first moved to          
 Pallingham Manor Farm; the whole      
 farmstock travelling by train from    
 Devon to Billingshurst.               
  Thanks are also due to:-             
    Mr. and Mrs J.Parker of Toat Farm  
    Mr.and Mrs L.Golden of Pallingham  
    Mrs J. Burnford of Borough Farm    
    Mrs A. Tyrell of Brinsbury College 
 all of whom personally accompanied me 
 round their farms.                    
  Finally,thanks to the staff of West  
 Chiltington Primary School,           
 especially to the Deputy Head, Mr.O   
 Smith-Boyes. Without his help this    
 information would not have reached or 
 remained on the disc!
