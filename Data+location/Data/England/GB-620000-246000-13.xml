		<content> The area is of pleasing appearance    
 with many trees and hedges but only a 
 few elm tillers remain.  Villages have
 grown in size but it in with landscape
 as new homeowners quickly create      
 attractive gardens.  Church buildings 
 are in good condition.  They and      
 public houses are used as reference   
 points for travellers.  Only two pubs 
 in the area: 'The Falcon' 20/46 and   
 the old 'The Admiral' Head' 22/47     
 recetly attractively renovated.       
 Buildings are brick-built, mainly red,
 although some larger 19th century     
 houses are of Suffolk Whites; a few   
 cottages with flint walls.  Playford  
 hall in Fynn Valley is hidden from    
 north and south areas by land profile 
 and trees.  Wooded area 22/46, 23/46  
 is comprised of deciduous trees,      
 privately owned.  Low summer rainfall 
 prevents vivid colouring in autumn.   </content>
