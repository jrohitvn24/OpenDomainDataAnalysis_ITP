		<content> The salmon weighed about 7 pounds     
 (weight) and would have cost about Â£20
 (money) at current market price. Some 
 of the 'big time' operators could make
 about Â£1000 per week and cause great  
 damage to salmon stocks in local      
 rivers.                               
  Water bailiffs have the power to     
 arrest criminals and take them to the 
 police station to be charged. The     
 penalties for poaching can be quite   
 severe for anybody who is caught for  
 instance 6 months in prison or fines  
 of up to Â£400. However, these         
 penalties are considered inadequate   
 and water authorities are hoping that 
 the laws will be strengthened in the  
 near future.
