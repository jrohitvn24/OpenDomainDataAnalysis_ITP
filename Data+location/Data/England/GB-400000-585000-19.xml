 from stone and are of a terraced or of
 a cottage type,and a Pele Tower.Before
 his death in 1958 Sir Charles         
 Trevelyan had arranged for bathrooms  
 to be added to all the houses,work    
 which was completed by the National   
 Trust when a full water supply and    
 sanitation was provided.

 stone.The newer council houses are    
 brick and painted over in grey.Central
 heating is at present being installed 
 in the council houses.
