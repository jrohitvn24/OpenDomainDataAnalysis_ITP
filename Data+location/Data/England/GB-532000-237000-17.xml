		<title>17THE OVER-SIXTIES CLUB</title>
		<content> The over-sixties club was formed in   
 November 1979 by the then Rector,Rev. 
 G.Stone.Thirty-one members attend     
 monthly meetings in the village hall. 
 There is a committee of seven, and    
 three helpers attend regularly to     
 provide refreshments.The members,who  
 come from Therfield and Kelshall area,
 enjoy games afternoons, when bingo,   
 scrabble and whist are very popular.  
 Outings are arranged about twice a    
 year and have included trips to the   
 sea, canal boat excursions, and       
 mystery tours. The club also visits   
 other clubs in the area and further   
 afield; visiting clubs then attend the
 annual church service held in         
 Therfield in the summer. Funds are    
 raised at coffee mornings so that     
 members may continue to enjoy the     
 comradeship of others and the club may
 further flourish.                     </content>
