		<content> Our school was burnt down by two boys 
 playing with matches,on Easter        
 Monday,April 1984.Four classrooms and 
 the hall were burnt.Straight after the
 fire we got one porta_cabin for       
 classes one and three.All of the      
 parents had meetings to decide if they
 would build the school again.If if had
 been decided not to build it again ,it
 would have been knocked down and every
 one would have to go to neighbouring  
 schools.They have begun re            
 building.The hall will be finished in 
 September and the two classrooms in   
 February.I am in the last year and we 
 have not been able to do P.E. or      
 assemblys all year.For the school to  
 be rebuilt it will cost about         
 Â£200,000.
