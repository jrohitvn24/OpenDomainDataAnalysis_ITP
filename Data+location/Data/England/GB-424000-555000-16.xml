		<content> Birtley town centre is situated along 
 the flat bottom of a valley its good  
 communications have led to quite heavy
 industrialisation, which in turn has  
 led to the growth of Birtley from a   
 rural village into an urban town      
 expanding up the east side of the     
 valley.                               
    To the west of the valley, much of 
 the rural area remains and arable     
 farming with traditional hedgerow     
 enclosed fields predominate.          
    The buildings in the older central 
 part of the town consist mainly of    
 brick terraced housing and small      
 family shops, although recently modern
 supermarkets have begun to open. They 
 remain few in number however. The     
 larger buildings of past importance   
 are built from stone blocks. On the   
 frings are link villas, bungalows &amp;   
 semi-detached houses predominate.     </content>
