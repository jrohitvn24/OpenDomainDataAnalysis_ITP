 portacabin which was bought in 1984   
 with the aid of a Government grant.The
 group previously met in Ellenroad Ring
 Mill which has since been demolished. 
 The playgroup sessions run from 9.15  
 to 11.45 and the cost is Â£2.75 per    
 child per week. The group can cater   
 for upto 30 children of pre-school    
 age. There is a Committee of twelve   
 mothers who run the group. The money  
 raised through charges is used to pay 
 ground rent,insurance and fuel bills. 
 Fund raising events are necessary.    
   Normally five adults teach the      
 children; the group leader is Aunty   
 Cath and she is helped by an assistant
 and three volunteers. The children are
 taught numbers and colours and how to 
 use different equipment and materials.
 Before the children go home they are
