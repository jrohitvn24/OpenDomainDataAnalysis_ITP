		<title>15A DAY ON DARTMOOR</title>
		<content> We can see the moors from our school  
 and we sometimes go there for field   
 trips. On July 10th 1985 Class 8 did a
 walk from Cadover Bridge. We walked up
 a path beside the Plym and we saw some
 mortar stones which were evidence of  
 tin streaming long ago. We went to    
 Brisworthy Farm which is a hill farm  
 where they grow crops and keep sheep. 
 We then walked to a stone circle and a
 stone row, both of which were made in 
 the Bronze Age about 2_3000 years ago.
 We also saw a kistvaen, a small       
 granite tomb where they used to bury  
 their dead. We buried Mark, he just   
 fitted! We then climbed Legis Tor and 
 at last had dinner! We found a vermin 
 trap which farmers used to build to   
 catch vermin when they bred rabbits   
 here. Lastly we went down to the river
 and swam and played till it was time  
 to walk back to the cars and go home. </content>
