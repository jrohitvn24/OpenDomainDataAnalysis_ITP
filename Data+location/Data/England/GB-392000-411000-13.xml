		<content>{BULLDOG}At school we play Bulldog. Any
 large number can play. Somebody is    
 "on" and the rest stay behind the line
 in the yard. The person who is "on"   
 shouts "Bulldog" and the others try to
 run across the yard to the other side 
 without getting tug. When someone is  
 tug they are on too. Then the first   
 person to be on names someone they are
 going to try and tig next time. It's  
 hard to get past because now two      
 people are trying to stop you. When   
 the named person is tug then the      
 second person to be tug chooses. The  
 game carries on like that until       
 everyone is caught.                   
{ONE BOUNCE}                           
 Many can play. Everyone stands in a   
 long line facing a wall. The first    
 person bounces the ball against the   
 wall and the next has to catch it.    
 If they miss they are out.            </content>
