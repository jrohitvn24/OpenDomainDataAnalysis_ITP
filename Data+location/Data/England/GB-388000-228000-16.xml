		<title>16TREDINGTON,STOKE ORCHARD</title>
		<content> Within our area of study there are    
 two ancient{churches}serving the two  
 villages of Tredington and Stoke      
 Orchard. Tredington Church is         
 dedicated to St. John the Baptist and 
 Stoke Orchard Church is named after   
 St. James the Great.  The two villages
 with their two churches are one       
 parish.  Up to the earlier part of    
 this century they were independant.   
 Stoke Orchard being part of the parish
 of Bishops Cleeve.  Both Churches are 
 12th century.  Tredington is perhaps  
 the older.  Stoke Orchard church is   
 usually dated as 1160 and has had few 
 alterations since that time.  The nave
 has has only one alteration - the     
 addition of a larger window to let in 
 more light.  The chancel was rebuilt  
 in the 14th century.  What makes St.  
 James church of historic interest  are
 the wall paintings in the nave.       </content>
