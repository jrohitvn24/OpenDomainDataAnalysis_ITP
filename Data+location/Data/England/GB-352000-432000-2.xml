		<title>02Our School In Fulwood.</title>
		<content> Ours is a Church Of England School,   
 opened in 1976 by the Bishop Martineau
 of Blackburn. It was built for a new  
 estate and was named St. Peter's after
 a church that was being closed down.  
 The school has 7 classes. The numbers 
 in the classes vary from 27-34.       
 The majority of the school is open    
 plan.In the heart of the school is a  
 big hall and as you step on the       
 polished floor you are faced with a   
 wooden screen. On assembly days and   
 Sundays the screen pulls back leaving 
 an altar, lectern and sanctuary.      
 Behind you there are climbing frames  
 and ropes. There are several uses for 
 this hall:- dining, P.E., singing and 
 assemblies.                           
 In the field around our school we have
 running tracks, rounders, football and
 cricket pitches. We have two          
 playgrounds for infants and juniors.  </content>
