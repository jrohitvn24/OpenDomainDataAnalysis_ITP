		<title>17The Doll Museum at Cromwell</title>
		<content>  {Vina Cooke}runs the{Museum of Dolls 
 and{Bygone Childhood}at the Old       
 Rectory in{Cromwell.}The{Rectory}dates
 from about{1685}and has housed the    
 museum since 1984 giving a new lease  
 of life to this fine building which   
 had been near empty for many years.   
   She first made dolls as a little    
 girl during World War 2 when dolls    
 were scarce. Her first doll was{Snow  
{White,}modelled in candle wax. She    
 began making  dolls for her small     
 daughter and developed a technique    
 using stretchy{stockinette}which over 
 the years has become her unique style.
 Soon she was creating her own gallery 
 of portrait dolls of Film Stars and   
 Pop Stars. A gallery of dolls of Kings
 and Queens followed. With her husband 
 she now also makes{porcelain}dolls    
 with wooden, jointed bodies which are 
 sent to customers all over the world. </content>
