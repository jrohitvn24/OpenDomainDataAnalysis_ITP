		<content> Caroline's father helps to breed      
{racehorses}for Her Majesty the Queen's
 Representative at Royal Ascot.        
 Caroline's father said that,          
  "When you are looking for a good     
 horse you look for a kind eye, plenty 
 of bone and an athletic walk.In winter
 they are fed four times a day on      
 Australian oats,bran,flaked maize,race
 nuts,boiled linseed andgood hay.The   
 average size of a racehorse is 16     
 hands and the average size of it's    
{stable}is 14' by 12'.Flat racehorses  
 start{racing}when they are two years  
 old.{Steeplechasers}start at five     
 years of age.Steeplechasing got it's  
 name from years ago when people would 
 race across country using church      
 steeples as landmarks. When the horses
 race they have to have special racing 
 plates (shoes) made of aluminium so   
 they can race faster."                </content>
