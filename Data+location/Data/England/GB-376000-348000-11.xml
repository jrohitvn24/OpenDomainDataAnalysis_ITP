		<title>11HALL O' TH' WOOD</title>
		<content>The Hall O' Th' Wood was built for the 
first Sheriff of Cheshire who was named
George Wood.It is approximately 500 yrs
old but nobody knows the exact age of  
the building and it is the only listed 
building in the parish.                
It is built of oak and brick and the   
plaster of wattle and daub.The oak     
beams are held together by pegs and the
present owners have done no major      
alterations to it since moving there 10
yrs ago.                               
George Wood is said to have built the  
house here because you could see as far
as the Lake District.Queen Elizabeth   
1st is also believed tohave slept here 
and it is thought that the builder of  
nearby Little Moreton Hall also built  
the Hall O' Th' Wood.It used to be a   
working farm until this century and my 
grandfather owned until he moved to
