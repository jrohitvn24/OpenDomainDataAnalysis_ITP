		<title>10Farming in S/W Dartmoor.</title>
		<content> There is quite a lot of farming in the
 area.Most farms keep sheep.The sheep  
 are both branded and sprayed with a   
 colour,some farmers have cows, which  
 are usually Friesian,for their        
 milk,cream and butter.Lots of farmers 
 keep moorland ponies for a hobby and  
 they are branded with the owner's     
 initials.They are usually Dartmoor    
 Ponies and are found in herds.Most    
 farmers grow corn to send to          
 buyers.There are a few farmers who    
 keep pigs for pork but there are no   
 farms completely for pigs.Sometimes,  
 if the farmers think that the weather 
 is right,they will grow things like   
 cabbages,swede,kale,potatoes and      
 parsnip.
