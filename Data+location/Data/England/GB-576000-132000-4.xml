		<title>04BENENDEN WEALD, GEOLOGY</title>
		<content> Through the centre of the area from   
 north-west to south-east lies the     
 Benenden fault which brings an        
 anticline of Ashdown beds to the      
 surface. To the north of this the area
 is mainly made of Wadhurst clay, while
 the southern part is mostly of        
 Tunbridge Wells sandstone capped by   
 Weald clay on the higher ground. This 
 sounds as though there are great      
 differences in rock type but the sands
 are interbedded with clays, and the   
 clays with sands so that the          
 distinction between the rock types is 
 not obvious in the field. The  relief 
 is more marked where small streams    
 draining  via the Hexden Channel to   
 the Rother cut deeply into the land   
 producing steep wooded valleys.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
