		<content> Underlying the area are rich deposits 
 of{coal.}How this coal was to be      
 extracted was the subject of a public 
 enquiry held during the early 1980s . 
 The recommendations of the enquiry    
 restricted surface development outside
 of the{Vale of Belvoir.}The pithead is
 now being built at{Asfordby.}The NCB  
 wanted to build a mine between Hose   
 and Harby but planning permission was 
 refused.                              
  In the village of Harby{flooding}has 
 been a problem.During the summer of   
 1985 new surface water drains have    
 been dug.This has left the footpaths, 
{roads and verges}in a poor state. The 
 re_surfacing of the roads is planned  
 for September 1985.                   
  Another issue that the Parish Council
 is presently concerned with is that of
 the insulation of{street lighting}at a
 cost of Â£30,000.                      </content>
