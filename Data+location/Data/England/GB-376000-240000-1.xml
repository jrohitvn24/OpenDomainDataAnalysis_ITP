		<title>01MALVERN WELLS IN OUTLINE</title>
		<content> The people of{Malvern Wells}and{Little
{Malvern}have life styles to which many
 people would aspire. The impression is
 of an affluent and law abiding        
 community which values much that is   
 traditional. In this semi-rural area  
 a car appears to be a virtual         
 necessity for employment, shopping and
 entertainment. The scenic beauty of   
 the{Malvern Hills}and the views over  
 the Severn plain and Herefordshire are
 major attractions. Activities and     
 places associated with the area       
 include education, farming, health    
 care, recreation, tourism, Elgar's    
 music, and the 3 Counties Show, Little
 Malvern Priory, British Camp,         
 St.Wulstans Hospital and the Holy     
 Well. The area has lost its branch    
 railway line; but it does have new    
 industries, housing estates and new   
 methods of farming and conservation.  </content>
