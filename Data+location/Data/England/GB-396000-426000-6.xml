		<title>06The Buttress</title>
		<content> The{Buttress}used to be a main        
 road. To go over the tops was a very  
 important way from{Halifax}to{Hebden  
{Bridge.}This was because of woollen   
 cloth which was colled by packhorse   
 from hand loom weaves in the upland   
 cottages and farms and also because   
 the valleys were originally very      
 swampy and the hillways were easier.  
 The route to{Lancashire}climbed the   
 Buttress after crossing the Old       
 Bridge, crossed the site of the       
 present road and went up to           
 Heptonstall. The route can still be   
 followed above today's present road.  
 The cobbled Buttress as well as the   
 Old Bridge is still very much the     
 same. It has not changed much in three
 or four hundred years, except that    
 houses at the bottom have been pulled 
 down and widened at that point.
