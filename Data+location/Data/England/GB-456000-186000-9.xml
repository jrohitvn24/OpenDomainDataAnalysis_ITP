		<title>09The Brook</title>
		<content>Some parts of {the brook} are clean and
other parts oily. In it have been      
dumped poles, wood, tyres, bicycles,   
trolleys and plastic bags. Half way    
along it is polluted and no wild life  
lives there. if you walk along the     
brook at the clean parts you can  see  
{newts, frogs, fish, toads, pike,      
minnows, water voles and rats.}The     
creatures that are seen on the ground  
are {spiders, moorhens, blackbirds and 
moles.} plants found down by the brook 
are {nettles, cowslips, rape, holly    
bushes and small trees.} At one point  
there are some plants across the brook 
underneath are leaches and sinking     
sand. Alongside the brook is a path    
and at one part the brook is shallow   
enough to walk across wearing boots.
