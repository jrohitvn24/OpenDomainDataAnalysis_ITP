		<content> My name is Harry Clegg, and I am 54   
 and married to Elsie who is 50.  We   
 live in Manchester and have been      
 coming to Blackpool for two weeks for 
 the past twenty-seven years.  We also 
 stay at the same boarding house which 
 is more like a second home.  Though   
 the weather is not always as nice as  
 we would like it to be, there is      
 always plenty to do when it is bad.   
 Elsie loves her bingo and shopping and
 in the evening there are plenty of    
 shows and places to go for a drink,   
 which are usually very lively.  We    
 both find the place very friendly, and
 we will be coming back at the same    
 time next year.
