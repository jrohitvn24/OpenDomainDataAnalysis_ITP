		<title>12New Wood Farm, Stourton</title>
		<content>     In my village most houses are less
than 40 years old, but mine is 270     
years old. It is called New Wood       
Farm but before  it was known as the   
Â£Old Nail House' because the front     
door is studded with large black nails.
     We bought it in 1982. It was      
practically derelict having been empty 
for two years. It was left furnished,  
there were newspapers dating back to   
1960, tins of food in the cupboard and 
false teeth in a glass! It took a year 
to get it into decent shape. The       
pigstys and outbuildings except the    
cow shed had to be demolished.         
The house is of red brick, honey-      
suckle climbs round the windows and we 
have a menagerie of birds and batsin   
the attic. There is no feeling of eeri-
ness; it is a friendly place and when  
the rain thrashes the window and the   
log fire crackles, the best place.     </content>
