		<content>{ How To Tell The Age Of A Hedgerow    
 We measured 27m of hedgerow and in    
 those 27m we had to find all the      
 different trees,shrubs and bushes we  
 could.If you found 3 different types  
 the hedge would be about 300 years    
 old.We measured two lengths of hedge  
 in the Vale(O/S G.Ref.SK 529655).One  
 was 400 years old and the other was   
 300 years old.

{ Trees In The Vale                    
 We also took a rough percentage count 
 of the trees along the river between  
 the two stone bridges(O/S G. Ref.SK   
 527652 and 532654).Hawthorne 24% Wych 
 Elm 17% Elder 14% Beech 10.5% Oak 8.5%
 Silver Birch 8% Hornbeam 4% Larch 4%  
 Rowen 4% Sycamore 4% Willow 2.5% Black
 Poplar 2% Hazel 2% Alder 2% Ash 1%    
 Norway Spruce 1% These figures can be 
 compared with those for{Hind Car Wood.</content>
