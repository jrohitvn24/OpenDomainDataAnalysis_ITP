 main bus service, there were also     
 smaller ones like{Ickwells}and{       
{Brudins.}Buses were smaller, there    
 would be a driver and conductor. They 
 had hard seats and were not so        
 comfortable. In the summer private    
 companies ran to{Skegness}and{        
{Blackpool.}All the pits worked
