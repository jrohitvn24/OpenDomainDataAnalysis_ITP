 LINCOLNSHIRE BORN PEOPLE ARE KNOWN AS 
 'YELLOWBELLIES'.THE ORIGINS OF THIS   
 TERM ARE DISPUTED AND SUGGESTED       
 DERIVATIONS HAVE INCLUDED A SPECIES OF
 FENLAND FROG, THE POPPY JUICES TAKEN  
 BY INHABITANTS SUFFERING FROM         
 MALARIA,THE DYED STOMACHS OF SHEEP    
 FEEDING FROM A MUSTARD CROP  IN THE   
 FIELDS, AND FARM WORKERS STRIPPED TO  
 THE WAIST AND WORKING WITH THEIR BACKS
 TO THE SUN - HENCE A BROWN BACK AND A 
 YELLOW BELLY. HOWEVER, THE MOST USUAL 
 EXPLANATION IS THAT THE ORNAMENTAL    
 FASTENINGS, (OR FROGS) DOWN THE       
 UNIFORMS OF THE LINCOLNSHIRE REGIMENT 
 WERE YELLOW. THAT REGIMENT, (NOW PART 
 OF THR SECOND BATTALION, ROYAL ANGLIAN
 REGIMENT), HAS AS ITS REGIMENTAL      
 MARCH 'THE LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER' WHICH
 HAS BECOME THE FOLKSONG ANTHEM OF THE 
 COUNTY.                               </content>
