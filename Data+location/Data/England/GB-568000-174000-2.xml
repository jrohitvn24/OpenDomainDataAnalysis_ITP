		<content> Primary major land-cover is rough     
 uncultivated marshy grassland         
 interspersed with dykes and footpaths.
 Cattle and sheep graze on enclosed    
 grassland. It is an ideal habitat for 
 birds,butterflies and other wildlife. 
 As there are few metalled roads in    
 this area vehicles are usually farm   
 tractors. However there are several   
 excellent footpaths, including the    
 Saxon Shore Way ,clearly marked with a
 Saxon's helmet symbol, making this an 
 attractive an interesting area for    
 walkers and students of natural       
 history. The{Saxon Shore Way}follows  
 the North Kent coastline along the    
 bank of the{River Thames} as it flows 
 between Kent and Essex on its way to  
 the North Sea. One square kilometre   
 southwest of{Shornemead Fort}is closed
 to the public when the army is using  
 the nearby firing range.              </content>
