		<title>01AUDLEM, CHESHIRE</title>
		<content> The large village of Audlem, once a   
 market town, is situated in gently    
 rolling countryside, largely given    
 over to the raising of cattle. Many of
 the fields are heavily fertilised     
 given a certain "flavour" to the      
 locality. Agriculture and associated  
 industries, including specialist      
 farmhouse cheesemaking, continue to   
 employ many of the local population   
 though over the last twenty years     
 there has been a steady increase in   
 numbers of village dwellers working   
 elsewhere. The village serves as a    
 focal point for smaller communities   
 around and can furnish most needs with
 its variety of shops, three churches, 
 public houses and the Town Hall, where
 many functions are held. In summer    
 months the Shropshire Union Canal     
 provides a steady stream of tourists.
