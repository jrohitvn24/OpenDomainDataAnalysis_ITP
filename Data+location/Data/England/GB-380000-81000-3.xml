		<content> The Weld Estate (see Biography The    
 Weld Family) encourage conservation in
 the block by their own action.They    
 commissioned a Hedgerow Survey of the 
 hedges which date from 1768, when they
 were planted as boundaries to the     
 Post-Enclosure farms.                 
 After the desecration of hedges in the
 nineteen seventies the aim is now to  
 conserve them as our heritage.The main
 species discovered were Hawthorn, Ash,
 Gorse, Blackthorn, Elder, Bramble,    
 Dogwood and Hazel.                    
 The tenant farmers spray fields,but   
 avoid the hedges and verges allowing  
 all species of wildlife to flourish   
 (see Ecology).Members of the crow     
 family are destroyed,but badgers are  
 not, nor are hares.Rabbits are only   
 culled when their numbers become a    
 nuisance.
