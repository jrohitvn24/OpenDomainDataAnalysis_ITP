		<content>Ancient Monument: The Devil's Dyke is a
ditch and a bank up to 15 ft. high     
which stretched straight and unbroken  
for 7 1/2 miles from the fen edge at   
Reach to the forest edge at Woodditton.
It was probably built in the 5th       
century but the exact date is not      
known. There are now gaps in it for    
roads to go through and during the late
war when there was an airfield on the  
Heath it was found necessary to cut    
away a section to allow planes to take 
off and land safely. Rare flowers and  
butterflies may sometimes be seen.     
Now it provides a beautiful, peaceful  
place to walk and many sponsored walks 
for charity take place there.  It also 
provides a good view of the racing!
