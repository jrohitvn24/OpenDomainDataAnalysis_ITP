		<content> In Cottesmore we have some Clubs like 
 Gymnastics,Recorders and Folk dancing,
 and there is a Family's Club.We also  
 have Scouts,Guides,Brownies and Cubs. 
 Cubs and Scouts are brothers though   
 they are in different packs; we do    
 tests to earn badges.I go to cubs     
 every Thursday; our pack is called    
 Seeone.The first thing we do is Grand 
 Howl and Flag Break, when we unfold   
 the flag.                             
 By a street called Garth Street there 
 is a Bowling Alley.You can join a club
 and play Ten Pin Bowling.We also have 
 clubs at lunch time and after school  
 There is Music,Science, Country       
 Dancing and Needle Work.Some people go
 to Tae Kwan Do where you can learn    
 self defence and Judo. The adults go  
 to the Families Club which was opened 
 by the Queen last year. Plays are     
 acted in the Swing-Wing Club.         </content>
