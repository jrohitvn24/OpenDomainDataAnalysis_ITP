		<title>16    SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> Social concerns in this area vary     
 according to age. Concern about litter
 was general to all age groups         
 particularly where public gulleys     
 were disfigured in this way.          
 Environment was a major concern;      
 people were keen on a tidy,pleasant   
 area and showed disapproval of cars   
 parked on grass verges.               
 Cuts in bus services and increase in  
 fares was a general concern,          
 particularly with the elderly.        
 Lack of state nursery facilities and  
 leisure facilities were also a        
 concern,as was the lack of a 6th form 
 college.                              
 Unemployment,rates,vandelism,education
 and increase in immigrants were the   
 main national concerns.               
 Among others mentioned were nuclear   
 defence and pollution.
