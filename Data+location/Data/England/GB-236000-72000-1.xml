		<content> THE PROJECT AREA IS GEOGRAPHICALLY    
{SITUATED IN THE TAMAR VALLEY,BETWEEN  
 DARTMOOR TO THE EAST, IN DEVON, AND   
 BODMIN MOOR, TO THE WEST IN           
 MID_CORNWALL. IT IS{AN AREA OF GREAT  
{NATURAL BEAUTY,}WITH ROLLING HILLS AND
 VALLEYS MORE ASSOCIATED WITH DEVON AND
 CONTRASTING WITH THE MORE RUGGED      
 LANDSCAPE OF THE MOORS. THIS IS       
 EMPHASISED BY LARGE NUMBER OF TREES   
 DECIDUOUS AND CONIFEROUS STILL TO BE  
 FOUND IN COMPARISON WITH MUCH OF MID  
 AND NORTH CORNWALL. REMINDERS OF THE  
{INDUSTRIAL PAST,}WHEN THIS WAS AN     
{IMPORTANT MINING DISTRICT}CAN READILY 
 SEEN BY THE NUMBER OF OLD SHAFTS AND  
 STACKS THROUGHOUT THE AREA. TODAY THE 
 SCARS OF THE EXPLOITATION OF THE LAND 
 ARE FADING AND ATTEMPTS TO RECLAIM THE
 MINING SITES ARE UNDER WAY. APART FROM
 SMALL SETTLEMENTS AND AREAS OF        
 WOODLAND,{AGRICULTURE PREDOMINATES.   </content>
