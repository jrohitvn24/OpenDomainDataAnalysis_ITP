		<title>01Description of Colne Valley</title>
		<content>    The deep broad valley of the river 
 Colne runs diagonally across the      
 area.The stepped valley sides provide 
 for farms with dairy herds and sheep. 
    Settlement in the area is of four  
 types. The old cottages and farms of  
 the hilltops date from before the     
 industrial revolution, while the small
 towns of Slaithwaite and Milnsbridge  
 grew up with the expansion of textiles
 and contain many mills and terraced   
 housing.Council estates were built in 
 Cowlersley and Golcar, and in recent  
 years there has been much private     
 house building in Linthwaite, Golcar  
 and around Scapegoat Hill.            
    Many of the woollen mills are empty
 following the decline in the textile  
 industry, but there are smaller       
 manufacturing units, chemical and     
 engineering works in the valley.
