 flint and the pillars are made from   
 Beer stone. The roof is slate.Dalwood 
 has shared a vicar with Stockland, the

 present vicar, Rev. Hope, has been    
 vicar for eight years.The church holds
 135 seated comfortably. For special   
 services extra seating is brought     
 in.There are six church bells, two of 
 which are medieval. The tower is      
 approx. 65' high. The church clock is 
 run by electricity.On average there   
 are one or two baptisms and marriages 
 per year but around seven to eight    
 burials as the population of Dalwood  
 is mainly elderly people.
