		<title>10BOROUGHBRIDGE HOUSES</title>
		<content> The houses in Boroughbridge are now up
 to a modern standard but there are    
 still a lot of houses and cottages    
 over three hundred years old. Now     
 adays bricks are used from different  
 parts of England but before they were 
 made from brick yards in the local    
 area. The roofs are made in tiles or  
 slates. There are two types, one made 
 out of blue slate and the other type  
 is made out of clay. In and around the
 country there are semi-detached,      
 detached and terraced houses. I live  
 in a cottage it is over three hundred 
 years old. On the roof it has slates.
