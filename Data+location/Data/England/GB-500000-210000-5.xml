{FELLING &amp; replanting}cycles for       
 deciduous trees,for timber.GRANTS are 
 available from the Forestry Commission

 nurse-crop for the hardwoods: Oak,    
 Beech, Larch &amp; Cherry &amp; provide       
 interim income. Trees are thinned     
 after 18-20 yrs, then every 5 yrs.    
 Muntjac Deer damage the young Cherry
