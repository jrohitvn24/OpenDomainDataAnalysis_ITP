 "As a Parent Governor I have held     
 office since October,1984.I became    
 involved out of interest in the       
 school, having served on the P.T.A. I 
 enjoy being able to influence some of 
 the things that go on in the school.  
 I have previously been governor of    
 both a Liverpool and a Welsh school.  
 I think we should make suggestions to 
 the Headteacher;he would be very      
 glad to listen.We don't want to make  
 any changes to the school, largely    
 because we are happy with how it is   
 run.The changes we have discussed have
 been carried out;parking outside      
 school,closure of the annexe,and      
 increased swimming time.At present we 
 are trying to get more accomodation."
