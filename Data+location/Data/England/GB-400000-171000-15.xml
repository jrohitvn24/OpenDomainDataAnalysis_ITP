		<title>15     CYCLING - CALNE</title>
		<content> I cycle to school on my bike every    
 day. I like cycling because when you  
 are going down hill you can really go 
 fast but I don't like it so much when 
 you go up long steep hils and your    
 legs are tired, when you get out of   
 breath and feel very hot.When you come
 to a steep hill you have to get off   
 and push your bike. When I go home    
 from school I go down Mill Street and 
 feel the wind through my hair and     
 buffeting my face. I go past Dixon's  
 shop and towards Curzon Street. When I
 go up that hill I find it very hard   
 because I am tired out. I  usually get
 up from my seat and lean over the     
 handle bars. I do like going down     
 hill, I do not stop to free wheel, I  
 just carry on cycling, getting faster 
 and faster. When I go past fields with
 lots of daisies they just look like a 
 green blur with white patches.        </content>
