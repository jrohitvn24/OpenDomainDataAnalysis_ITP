		<content> Easton(earlier known as{Eastone by    
{Honingham)}is a village just North of 
 the{Hingham}boundary. Easton belongs  
 to the manor of Costessey. It has a   
 tiny church, some parts of which date 
 back to the 12th century. The village 
 of Easton was situated around the     
 church.                               
  In{1348, the Black death             
{(Plague)}killed nearly{half}of the    
 population and so those remaining     
 moved away, mostly down to the River  
 Tudd. This part of Easton still       
 remains and is now called{Lower Easton

{Adam de Easton,}who became a{Roman    
{Cardinal.}He was a descendant of an   
 earlier settler in the village, who   
{took his name from the village,}which 
 was a common practice when surnames   
 were adopted.                         </content>
