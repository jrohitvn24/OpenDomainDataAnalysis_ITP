		<content> Perhaps the most interesting building 
 in Stockland is the Cider House       
 belonging to Percy Copp.This is       
 situated 12m.east of Churchstyle Farm 
 House and could be as early as        
 C16.Cider is still made here behind a 
 strong boarded door.It is a small cob 
 building with a thatched roof.        
 The houses on the Yarcombe Road are   
 also a delight.Kite's Cottage,probably
 the oldest building in Stockland, is  
 circa 1500.This stands on the corner  
 opposite the Post Office.The White    
 House is a marvellous example of late 
 Georgian architecture.The King's      
 Thatch used to be a public house and  
 before  that a row of cottages.These  
 houses make Stockland a most beautiful
 village in which to browse around.
