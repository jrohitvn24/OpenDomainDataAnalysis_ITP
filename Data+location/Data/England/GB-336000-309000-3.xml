		<content>  People have to travel to{Westbury}to 
 see a doctor.Dr.Williams and Dr. Lewis
 work at Five Oaks,Westbury.           
  The practice goes from Nesscliffe to 
 Stiperstones and from Shrewsbury to   
 Welshpool.There are 4,000 patients    
 altogether.Morning surgery opens from 
 9 until 10:at night from from 5 to 6. 
 After morning surgery they go to      
 visit people who are too ill to drive.
  On a very busy day the doctors see be
 -tween 60 and 70 people altogether.If 
 there are no urgent calls they go to  
 see people who are always ill.As there
 is not a chemist in the area you are  
 able to get your medicines from the   
 dispensary in the surgery.            
  Two babies have been born to families
 in the block this year {Adrian Randles
