		<title>19FARMING IN THE UPWEY AREA</title>
		<content> DORSET IS AN AGRICULTURAL COUNTY AND  
 AS SUCH THE UPWEY AREA IS NO          
 EXCEPTION.                            
 THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BLOCK IS     
 CONNECTED IN SOME WAY WITH FARMING,AS 
 EITHER AGRICULTURAL LAND OR AS FARM   
 BUILDINGS AND THE LIKE.               
 THE MAIN FARMS IN THE AREA ARE: FRIAR 
 WADDON,WINDSBATCH FARM,HEWISH         
 FARM,BAYARD FARM,DOWN FARM AND LOWER  
 BINCOMBE FARM.                        
 MOST OF THE FARMS OPERATE MIXED       
 FARMING ALTHOUGH WINDSBATCH FARM IS   
 ALMOST ENTIRELY DAIRY.                
 THE MAIN TYPES OF CEREALS ARE GROWN ON
 ALL THE OTHER FARMS,INCLUDING         
 WHEAT,BARLEY,OATS AND MAIZE.FODDER    
 CROPS AND OTHERS SUCH AS OILSEED RAPE 
 AND KALE CAN ALSO BE FOUND.           
 IN THE SUMMER A PARTICULARLY GOOD     
 IMPRESSION OF THE DOMINANCE OF FARMING
 WILL BE SEEN FROM THE RIDGEWAY.       </content>
