		<content> Mr.G.King was brought up in Portsmouth
 between the two World Wars. His father
 was an officer in the Royal Navy at   
 the time, a position which Mr.King    
 later achieved. Portsmouth dockyard   
 was, at the time, the main port for   
 returning ships, and the harbour was  
 constantly a "sea of grey";(The ships 
 were returning after many years abroad
 defending the Empire at a regular     
 flow). Mr.King's father took his son  
 to the Fleet Review of 1937 which was 
 in honour of the Coranation of King   
 George VI. At the time of the review  
 the Royal Navy was enormous and the   
 review also included many ships from  
 all the main Navies of the World. At  
 that time World War II was clouding   
 the horizon and at the review were two
 ships from the Imperial Japanese Navy.
