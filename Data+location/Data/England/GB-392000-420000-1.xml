		<title>01WALSDEN  A Summary.</title>
		<content>   {Walsden}is a village near          
{Todmorden,}which has two schools and a
 church called St.Peters. There is a   
 Post Office and a few shops. There is 
 a railway and a canal and a busy main 
 road. The River Calder runs alongside 
 our school.                           
    Even though it is a small village, 
 it is busy with quite a few small     
 industries. There is a cricket club   
 and some playing fields where football
 is played sometimes.                  
    One of most popular features of    
 Walsden is the Garden Centre where    
 people come from miles around to buy  
 their seeds and plants.               
    Living in{Walsden}is quite like    
 being in the countryside, especially  
 where I live now. The nearest big city
 to{Walsden}is{Manchester,}which is in 
 Lancashire 20 miles away.{Walsden}is  
 just inside{Yorkshire.}               </content>
