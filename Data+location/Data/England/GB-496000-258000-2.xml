		<title>02Sharnbrook, The Village</title>
		<content> The core of the village is the High   
 Street with its{stone cottages,}many  
 of them 'listed buildings' dating back
 to the{17th. and 18th. centuries,}when
 the population of about 200 was mainly
{ engaged in agricultural work.}There  
 was some linear development from late 
 Victorian times to the 1930's, but{the
{coming of the railway, in 1857, does  
{not seem to have made a great impact. 
 Sharnbrook's expansion really began in
 the late 1960's, almost 10 years after
 the station closed!  Two housing      
 estates, with properties in a variety 
 of price ranges, were developed.  Both
 estates are centrally situated, yet   
 they do not encroach upon the quaint  
 appearance of the older part of the   
 village.  Today most of the adults    
 among the 2000 inhabitants are{white  
{collar workers.} There is no industry,
 and the farms are fully mechanised.   </content>
