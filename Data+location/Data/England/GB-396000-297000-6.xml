 More than one person is needed to play
 this game. We play it in the street.  
 One person stands by a post or marker 
 and has to hide his or her face while 
 everybody else hides. This person is  
 'on'. Then the person who is on has to
 come and find the children who are    
 hidden. If she or he finds them he or 
 she has to run back to the post and   
 shout Ackey 1_2_3 and the name of the 
 person found. If anyone is left they  
 can try to Ackey themselves, but if   
 they say release then all the children
 caught are freed.                     
  When only one person is left free the
 game is over. The free person is 'on'.
