		<content>     A large number of people in the   
area make fabric items (knitting, soft 
toys, etc.), do some woodwork and use  
cameras, but would not consider        
themselves artists or creative         
craftsmen.                             
                                       
{Events in Alstonefield}               
     In the village there is a         
Gymkhana and a horse show, also a      
wakes.  Both events go to help support 
the church.                            
     The Gymkhana, the Wakes and the   
sheep sale are all annual events.  The 
Gymkhana is usually held in May and    
there are jumping classes for ponies   
and horses.                            
     There is also a whist drive held  
in the village hall on a Monday        
evening.
