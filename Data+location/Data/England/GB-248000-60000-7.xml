		<content> Southway Precinct is our nearest out  
 of town shopping centre.There is a    
 supermarket with separate             
 greengrocery, a baker, a fish and chip
 shop, a DIY store, a betting shop, a  
 florist, a mens and womens            
 hairdresser,a chemist, a newsagent,   
 a post office which sells wool and    
 baby clothes, 3 banks and library. It 
 has a free car park, and a regular bus
 service to and from Plymouth passes   
 the precinct every 20 miniutes.Right  
 next to the Precinct there is the     
 church of the Holy Spirit. There is   
 also a denist and a doctor nearby.We  
 prepared a questionnaire about the    
 precinct and went there one morning.  
 We asked 50 people what they thought  
 of the centre and why they shopped    
 there.The results are on the next     
 page.
