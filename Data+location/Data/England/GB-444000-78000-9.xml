		<content> Access to the shingle and sand beach  
 is difficult and usually made down one
 of the steep cuts in the cliffs called
 chines.In the Atherfield area there   
 are four;East to West they are{Ladder,
{Whale,Shepherd's and Cowleaze.}Ladder 
 Chine is no longer safe because of    
 cliff falls but we visited the beach  
 via Whale Chine.There were 115 steps  
 down to the beach.Inspite of this,    
 this beach was popular with locals and
 holiday makers who prefer a quiet     
 unspoilt area to the more popular     
 beaches of other areas on the island. 
 Shepherd's Chine and Cowleaze Chine   
 are more accessible but are rather wet
 underfoot.There is a pumphouse and    
 weir at Shepherd's Chine and sewage   
 works including filterbeds at         
 Cowleaze.Access at any other point is 
 difficult and dangerous.
