		<content> There is a mixture of both middle and 
 working class families and there is an
 awareness of current fashion trends   
 both in dress and interior house      
 decoration.                           
                                       
 Because of the lack of public         
 transport most life styles are centred
 around car ownership since there is   
 very little social activity within the
 area.  There is only one shop situated
 in Peatling Parva selling vegetables  
 and home produced cakes, but a number 
 of mobile shops visit regularly.      
                                       
 Village based activities include the  
 youth club, Women's Institute, keep   
 fit classes, nursery school and       
 toddlers club. The village pub serves 
 food but is primarily concerned with  
 attracting non residents.
