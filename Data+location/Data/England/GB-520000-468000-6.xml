		<content> The building also houses a restaurant 
 and snack bar. In the nearby Clock    
 Tower is a licensed bar and there is a
 gift shop in what used to be a stable 
 block. The grounds are made up of     
 parkland and ornamental gardens but   
 now contain a variety of leisure      
 amenities. The front of the house     
 looks onto large lawns dotted with    
 trees which extend to within 200m of  
 the cliff top. Between the grounds and
 the cliff is the village cricket      
 pitch, separated by a sunken wall     
 known as a ha-ha. In earlier times it 
 prevented sheep and cattle from coming
 too close to the house and yet        
 remained out of site and did not spoil
 the view of Bridlington Bay. The rose 
 gardens are laid out in a symmetrical 
 pattern and the Old English Walled    
 garden contains a wide variety of     
 plants including figs and peaches.    </content>
