		<title>09THE PUMPING STATION</title>
		<content>                                       
  Addington Pumping station pumps water
 out of a well to Addington reservoir. 
 It holds the water which comes out of 
 our taps.                             
 In 1888 the old Pumping station began 
 to pump water from a well 205 feet    
 deep. It took 11 men to run it on     
 three 8 hour shifts. It was run on two
 big steam engines so it had a tall    
 chimney so it could let off steam. In 
 1937 there was a typhoid outbreak     
 traced back to a worker at the Pumping
 station who was a typhoid carrier.    
 The new Pumping station was opened in 
 1975 when the old one closed. The new 
 one has a well 410 feet deep.Its      
 equipment is fully automatic and it   
 only needs one person on an 8 hour    
 shift to run it. It can shut itself   
 down if there is a fault.
