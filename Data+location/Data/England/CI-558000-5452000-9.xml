		<content> Mr.Gibaut the Headmaster has been at  
 St.Mary's School for 6 years and hopes
 to stay for about 17 more. There are  
 130 children placed into 6 classes. In
 Reception there are 23 children,in    
 Infant 2-27,in Infant 3-18 in J1-19   
 inJ2/3-26 and in J4-17. All the       
 teachers are full-time except Mrs     
 Simon of Infant 2. Mr. Gibaut takes   
 over when she is not there. Mr.Gibaut 
 teaches half the day, the rest of the 
 day he might be writing letters or    
 making arrangements. Mr.Gibaut goes   
 home at around 5 pm. Mr.Gibaut's plans
 for the future are that maybe his     
 office will be moved and joined on to 
 part of the school. The school plays a
 part in the community because Mums and
 people in the Parish meet each other  
 when they take their children to      
 school. You start school at the age of
 4+ and leave after your 11th. birthday</content>
