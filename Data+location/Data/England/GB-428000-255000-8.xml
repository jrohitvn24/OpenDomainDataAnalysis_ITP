		<title>08A view of Moreton Morrell.</title>
		<content>{Moreton Morrell}is a quiet little     
 village with a population of nearly   
 600.It is about 7 miles south from    
 Warwick and is in{Warwickshire.       
 Middle Town was once the village; it  
 had a small chapel that has now been  
 converted into a house. Most of the   
 houses were built in the 19th.Century,
 though some are timbered cottages that
 are much older.                       
 There is one shop, one pub, one church
 and one school.                       
 I think there should be more          
 amusements for the young. Some of the 
 old people say that the village is    
 changing. But I think the village is  
 old fashioned.                        
 Quite a lot of old people live in the 
 village. In Oak Tree Close there are  
 bungalows for the old people.         
 All in all everybody in the village is
 very friendly.                        </content>
