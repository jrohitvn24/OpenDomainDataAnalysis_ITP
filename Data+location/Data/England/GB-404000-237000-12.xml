		<title>12CHILDSWICKHAM VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The village hall in Childswickham is  
 now the focal point of the village.   
 About sixty years ago a barn was      
 purchased with a committee acting as  
 trustees, each lending 10. The barn  
 was rebuilt and the money soon repaid 
 from fund raising activities such as  
 Saturday night dances with a local    
 three piece band, admission being     
 sixpence. Later old time dances were  
 run on Friday nights, one shilling for
 admission. After the 1939-1945 war the
 hall was renovated and plaques erected
 in memory of those who had died. It   
 was renamed the Memorial Hall. An     
 excellent snooker table was purchased 
 which is very much used by local and  
 outside players. The Womens Institute,
 Evergreens and Young Wives group meet 
 in the hall, other activities include 
 Bingo, Whist Drives, Suppers and Wine 
 and Cheese evenings.                  </content>
