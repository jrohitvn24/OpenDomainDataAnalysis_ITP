		<title>19Post-Excavation Prognosis</title>
		<content> The fields around East Goscote have   
 now been back-filled and the most     
 recent excavations to the west of     
 Cossington are now being back filled, 
 after each section has been mined.    
 Lorry movements have been reduced to a
 minimum by the use of a conveyor-belt 
 running beneath the (B5328),and trees 
 planted to form a screen between sand 
 and gravel pits and village of        
 cossington are growing well to hide   
 the workings. The area is having to   
 suffer temporary upheaval in order to 
 supply builders with sand and gravel, 
 the fears that were initially         
 expressed, concerning the damage to   
 the enviroment,have not been          
 realised,and the future should see the
 re-instatementof the lush green water 
 meadows that,before excavation,had    
 lain undisturbed since the first domes
 day book was compiled.See pages 17,18.</content>
