		<title>09CONSERVATION IN BURBAGE</title>
		<content> In recent years Burbage has grown     
 considerably, with the result that the
 village has lost some of its identity.
 However, the historic village centre  
 remains and has been recognised by    
 declaring it a Conservation Area in   
 1973.                                 
   The Conservation Area is dominated  
 by the Parish Church of St. Catherine.
 A church has stood here for many      
 centuries.Other buildings of interest 
 are Cedar Lawns and the Constitution  
 Club, once the home of George Canning 
 (1770-1827),Prime Minister of Great   
 Britain.Burbage Hall, a 17th century  
 building, is located in Aston Lane.   
   The Croft, a late 18th century      
 building, is found in Church Street.  
 This dwelling is connected with the   
 hosiery industry.                     
   The original Horsepool has now      
 disappeared and the land built on.    </content>
