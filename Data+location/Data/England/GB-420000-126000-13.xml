		<title>13EDUCATION A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> This morning I woke up at eight       
 o'clock and I got dressed and had my  
 breakfast.Then I walked to school and 
 went in. We started with Reading      
 Routes. During this time some children
 went over to the School Hall to play  
 recorders. After this I went out to   
 play. After play we did mental        
 arithmetic followed by mathematics.   
 At twelve o'clock I went over to the  
 School Hall for dinner. After lunch I 
 read my reading book. I went over to  
 the School Hall to help yhe playgroup.
 I sang songs from a book called       
 "Singing Together". It is a radio     
 programme. After that I did some topic
 work and then our teacher read us a   
 story. At three o'clock I went home. I
 walk home. It takes me about fifteen  
 minutes.
