		<title>03RUNCORN'S LOCAL CANALS</title>
		<content> Two canals pass through Runcorn:The   
 Manchester Ship Canal and The         
 Bridgewater Canal.We are proud to have
 the Bridgewater Canal as it was the   
 first to be built in England(1761).   
 Long ago it was a very busy canal,for 
 in Runcorn were the locks to take the 
 canal down to the level of the River  
 Mersey.Since 1974 the canal has become
 a leisure facility and is now widely  
 used for fishing and boating.The      
 Manchester Ship Canal used to be very 
 busy,with large liners going up to    
 Manchester.Recently the canal has     
 become very quiet and soon no ships   
 will be passing up to Manchester.     
 Shortly this canal will also take on  
 a new role.We hope it will become an  
 additional leisure facility that we   
 can all enjoy.It is hoped that it will
 be used for water sports and fishing.
