 Birchwood Shopping Centre opened in   
 November 1980.It took 4 years to build
 and cost about 5 million pounds.There 
 are 42 shops,a hyper-market,a         
 super-market,a Health Centre,a pub and
 several cafes.All the carparks have   
 pictures of animals as well as numbers
 because it is easier to remember an   
 animal.They got the idea from         
 Disneyland.The centre is next to the  
 railway station.Birchwood Station is  
 only the second new railway station to
 be bulit since the war.The shops are  
 all inside so the rain does not wet   
 you. The buses stop close to the      
 entrance too.Lots of people come to   
 shop at Birchwood. It is near three   
 motorways,the M6,M62 and M56.
