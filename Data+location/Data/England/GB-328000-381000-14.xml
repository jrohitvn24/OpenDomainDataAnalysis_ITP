		<content>         WORKING THE FARM.             
                                       
 One part time and two full time       
 workers help the farmer.              
   Grass is intensively managed to     
 produce silage.On the farm they also  
 grow barley,care for the cattle,clean 
 the parlour and animal quarters       
 restore fences and hedges etc.        
   The cows are milked at 6.15am and   
 3.15pm.They produce 200 gallons of    
 milk each day which is sold to Swan   
 Dairies.                              
   Poultry was once kept in large      
 numbers but the increased fox         
 population has made it impossible to  
 continue.                             
   The farmer has been farming since he
 was 12 years old.He enjoys his work   
 but he finds the present restrictions 
 on farmers imposed by the E.E.C.      
 frustrating.                          </content>
