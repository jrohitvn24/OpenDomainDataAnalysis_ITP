		<content>The boulder clay supports a typical    
neutral soil vegetation. In addition   
the presence of chalk particles allows 
such calcicolous plants as Traveller's 
Joy and Dogwood to thrive. Primroses   
and cowslips occur and where they grow 
in close proximity, hybridise to form  
the False Oxslip. Specimens of Ipheion 
Uniflorum have been found recently on a
roadside verge.                        
Several rights of way cross the area,  
see OS MAP TL84/94. Access is also     
granted on a grace and favour basis to 
a disused railway line. This was con-  
structed along the course of a tribu-  
tary of Chad Brook. A covered drainage 
channel with inspection covers borders 
the track. This channel is full of     
water in the driest of summers and     
supports an established mini pond-life.
