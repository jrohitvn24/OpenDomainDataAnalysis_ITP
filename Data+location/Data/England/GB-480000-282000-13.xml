		<content> SINCE 1960 Desborough has become twice
 as big as people have been attracted  
 to the area by the new businesses     
 such as{"Applebys".}As Desborough has 
 grown, more and more cars travel      
 through on the A6 and this has caused 
 a lot more pollution. The{environment 
 has been affected as Desborough has   
 grown. Applebys" started in 1982 and  
 created many jobs for people in       
 Desborough.In 1969,the old cross went 
 from near the monument.Old            
 people,mostly men,used to sit on the  
 seats around the cross and eat        
 nuts.Most of the hotels have          
 gone. The old train station has gone  
 and is now a garage.                  
 Most of the land in the survey block  
 is used for farming.The farm on the   
 way to Desborough has 233 acres of    
 land,200 lambing ewes,120 meat cattle,
 123 acres,and 35 acres of fruit.      </content>
