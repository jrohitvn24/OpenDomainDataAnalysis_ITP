		<title>09THE BULLOCKS ON HILL FARM</title>
		<content> We visited Hill Farm, near Cheveley.  
 It is 350 acres and is one of the     
 three local farms owned by Lord       
 Fairhaven. They have a total of 2,000 
 acres. Hill Farm is the only one with 
 any farm animals on it now.           
 Mrs Bowyer, the tenant of Hill Farm,  
 showed us the animals: fifteen        
 bullocks. Bullocks are bulls that have
 had an operation to make them calm so 
 that they are "its".                  
 The farm buys the bullocks when they  
 are four months old and they live     
 there until they are eighteen months  
 old. Then they go to market. They are 
 slaughtered in a kind way and then go 
 to the butchers' shops where they are 
 cut up for meat.
