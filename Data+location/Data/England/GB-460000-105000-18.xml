		<title>18SATURDAY WITH THE WARRENS</title>
		<content> On Saturday I woke up, went down      
 stairs and made the breakfast.  While 
 my scramble egg was cooking, I put on 
 my T shirt and jeans.  I went to see  
 the gerbils who were out.  After that 
 I played ball with Shep and hide and  
 seek.  Then we took Shep for a walk.  
 When we came home my mum said we could
 go swimming so we drove off but when  
 we got to HMS Dryad it was shut so we 
 went home.  It was lunch time so we   
 had our lunch.  Then my mum decided to
 go to the beach.  When we got there we
 walked on the shore and I saw ten dead
 cuttlefish and we collected shells.   
 After that we went home to bed.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
