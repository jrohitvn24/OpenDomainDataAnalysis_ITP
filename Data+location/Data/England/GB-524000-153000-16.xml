		<title>16Windmill Press: Kingswood</title>
		<content>     The Windmill Press is situated    
 amongst woodland. Building was        
 finished in 1928 and is in red brick  
 in Georgian style. The sight was      
 chosen by{Heinemann Press}(who still  
 own the building today) who wanted a  
 pleasant working place for their      
 workers.                              
     Today they offer{employment}to the
 area with a staff of aproximately 215.
     In 1965 the printing division     
 moved out to a more modern factory    
 in Crawley, and the Windmill Press at 
 Kingswood was given over to packaging,
 accounts and administration,          
 a use which it still serves today.    
     Eventually the printing works     
 itself moved to London . The site at  
 Kingswood is still suitable; being    
 close to London, with good land and   
 air{communications.
