		<title>10TOURISTS IN CAMBRIDGE</title>
		<content> TOURISM IS A WIDE-SPREAD ASPECT OF    
 CAMBRIDGE.  THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS FROM
 AROUND THE WORLD CROWD THE NARROW     
 STREETS IN TOWN.  THEY PHOTOGRAPH     
 BUILDINGS, HOUSES AND SHOPS, WHICH THE
 PEOLE WHO LIVE NEARBY TAKE LITTLE     
 INTEREST IN.  THE MAIN ATTRACTION IS  
 THE COLLEGES, WHICH STRETCH FROM ST.  
 JOHNS STREET, THROUGH TRINITY STREET  
 TO KINGS PARADE.  MANY FOREIGNERS     
 FLOCK ALONG THE ROADS LOOKING AT THE  
 LARGE ARCHWAYS, WHICH REVEAL SUNNY,   
 GREEN LAWNS INSIDE THE MOST POPULAR   
 SIGHTS ARE{THE BACKS,}WHERE           
 MOST OF THE CAMERAS ARE FOCUSED ON    
 KINGS COLLEGE CHAPEL.  ALTHOUGH       
 TOURISM IS QUITE ANNOYING (THE WAY    
 THEY USE UP THE PARKS AND GREENS,CROWD
 IN TOWN AND DROP LITTER) THE TRADERS  
 MAKE GOOD BUSINESS FROM THEIR SHORT   
 STAY.  ALSO, TO SOME EXTENT, THEY HELP
 COLLEGES BY CONTRIBUTING MONEY.       </content>
