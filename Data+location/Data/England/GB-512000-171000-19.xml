 estates with mainly light             
 manufacturing (secondary              
 industry):several engineering and     
 electronics firms including a number  
 of computer firms. There are marketing
 and distributive services as well. The
 Hanworth Trading Estate is the        
 largest.The Hampton Farm Industrial   
 Estate is the most modern. A firm     
 Teddington Centreless Grinding invited
 us to look round. We found they finish
 metal articles sent from other        
 companies.On the third estate one firm
 the Harven Form Foundry (metal        
 manufacturing works) has been on the  
 same site since 1942.Along Hampton    
 Road West there are also DER          
 Electronics in a tall office builing  
 called Apex House and Konica a        
 Japanese company. WHITTON SCHOOL
