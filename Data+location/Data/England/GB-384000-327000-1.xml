		<title>01CHEBSEY AND SHALLOWFORD</title>
		<content> The area is one of rolling countryside
 which reaches a height of 133 metres  
 towards the south-west.  The patchwork
 of fields is based around the valleys 
 of the River Sow and Meece Brook.  The
 area is dotted with several old marl  
 pits and small copses.                
 There are two concentrations of       
 population, the hamlets of Shallowford
 and Chebsey.  Otherwise it is mainly a
 farming community plus a few large    
 private dwellings.                    
 The east side of our area is bordered 
 by the main line railway between      
 London and Crewe or Stoke-on-Trent.   
 Norton Bridge station is just within  
 our north boundary.  An unclassified  
 road runs alongside the railway.      
 Crossing the area from east to west is
 the A5013 between Stafford (4 miles   
 away) and Eccleshall (2 miles away).
