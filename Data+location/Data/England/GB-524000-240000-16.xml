		<title>16DERELICT HOUSE</title>
		<content>  We saw a derelict house next door to 
 the Dairy. It has been deserted for   
 years. The dairy used to be in the    
 village until it was moved out because
 the villagers didn't like the mess and
 smell. The orchard near the house was 
 chosen for the new Farm buildings. It 
 was so close the house was not        
 saleable. The farmer only employs five
 men, three of them working on the     
 arable. With so few men he does not   
 need the cottages. The cottage is     
 thatched but this is falling off in   
 lumps. Birds bats and insects find it 
 an ideal habitat. The walls are wattle
 and daub with gaping window holes in  
 them. You can see the broken timbers  
 through the window and door apertures.
 It is a haven for all forms of        
 wildlife. Bats which are now protected
 live there in peace.
