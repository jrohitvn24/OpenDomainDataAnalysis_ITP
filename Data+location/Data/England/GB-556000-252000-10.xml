		<content> The land in the survey area is        
 predominantly used for cereals .      
 However, one square kilometre in the  
 area is currently mostly growing beet.
 There are no dairy cattle but some    
 beef cattle are reared here and       
 fattened on the hay pastures through  
 the winter.Sheep are over-wintered at 
 one of the farms and go elsewhere to  
 lamb in April. There are several      
 horses kept for foxhunting in the     
 area. The foxes take young pheasants  
 from the copses.A gamekeeper who is   
 responsible for the management of the 
 copses on the whole estate rears      
 pheasants and organises commercial    
 shoots. (See page on Recreation.)
