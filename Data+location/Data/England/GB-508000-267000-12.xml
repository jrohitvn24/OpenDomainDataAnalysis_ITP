		<title>12The Montagus of Kimbolton</title>
		<content> During the assembling of this material
 the{11th.Duke of Manchester}(i.e. God 
 manchester),Sidney Montagu,died and   
 his ashes were placed in the family   
 vault beneath the parish church.This  
 family came originally to Kimbolton in
 1615 and the second Earl played an    
 important part in the{Civil War.}The  
 first Duke was created in 1719.The    
 considerable estate accumulated has   
 gradually been fragmented during this 
 century.The family moved to Kenya in  
 1945 and the Castle was sold to       
 Kimbolton School in 1950 for          
 Â£12,500 and the remaining 3244 acres  
 of land-holding to{Boots Pension Fund}
 in 1970 for Â£1m.Consequently Kimbolton
 has lost the seigneurial influence    
 that pre-dates 1066.Older residents   
 still miss this social focus which    
 provided latterly a gentle benevolent 
 despotism.                            </content>
