		<title>14Entertainment in Chilsworthy</title>
		<content> The Chilsworthy/Latchley Show was     
 first started towards the end of the  
 second world war and carried on in the
 first instance until 1963. There was  
 then a break until the{queen's jubilee
{year of 1977, when it was restarted.  
 Since that date the show has grown    
 into one of the biggest local shows.  
 The{main exhibits}are those entries   
 into the various competitions for{&lt;a> 
{vegetables &lt;b> flower- arranging, &lt;c> 
{handicraft &lt;d> cookery.}There are also
 additional events, such as work from  
 local schools, a tug o' war competion 
 and other assorted stands from both   
 trade and local organizations such as 
 scouts and W.I. The{number of entries 
 has risen to just under a{thousand}in 
 the present year.
