 breakfast.I got dressed in my best    
 jeans.I went outside onto our drive.I 
 got the bus to York with my mum &amp;     
 Jamie my brother.In York we got off   
 the bus  and went to our club called  
 Explorers.At the club we do drawing or
 collages.We had a break at St.Johns   
 College for dinner. Then we did       
 some drawing.After Explorers we did   
 some shopping then we went home.For
