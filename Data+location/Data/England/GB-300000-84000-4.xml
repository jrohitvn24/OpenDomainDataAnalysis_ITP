		<title>04BLACKHILL QUARRY</title>
		<content>  Over 300 million years ago, a        
 swift-running stream, 3 miles wide,   
 flowed from Gloucestershire to France 
 by way of Somerset and Devon. It laid 
 down a gravel bed and it is on this   
 Bunter sandstone that Blackhill Quarry
 is sited. The sand and pebbles are    
 products of the friction caused by    
 that stream. There have been diggings 
 here since 1900's, when there was also
 a militia camp on the site. The       
 present quarry has a 'life' of 26 yrs 
 (2011).                               
   5 million gallons of water are      
 stored at the quarry and 800,000 galls
 are used daily for washing the sand   
 from the gravel economically. The     
 water is recirculated through the     
 plant from the Silt Ponds. It is also 
 used for fire fighting on Woodbury    
 Common.As each area is exhausted,     
 reclaimation is carried out.          </content>
