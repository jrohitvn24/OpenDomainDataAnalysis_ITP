		<content>    Hop fields and oast houses are a   
 distinctive feature of the Kent       
 countryside. Records indicate that    
 hops were first used for beer making  
 in 1524, although much earlier the    
 Romans used hops in salads.           
    The hop plant takes 5 years to     
 become established but can then remain
 in use for a further 25 years. In this
 time 60 ft. root systems can be grown.
 In February new string is put into the
 framework of poles and wires which    
 support the bines. In April the bines 
 are trained by hand, and then twice   
 more in May and June.                 
    The crop is harvested in August by 
 cutting down the bines.  The hops are 
 then stripped by machine and placed in
 pockets. From 24 acres at{Court Lodge 
{Farm}180 pockets are collected.       
    The price per hundredweight has    
 fallen from Â£400 to Â£50 in 1980.      </content>
