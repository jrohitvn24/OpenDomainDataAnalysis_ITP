		<content>{ORANGES AND LEMONS }Two children make 
 an arch and the other children pass   
 under and sing. It is about a lady    
 selling fruit in the street a long    
 time ago. Someone bought some but     
 couldn't pay. His head was chopped off
 and all the churches rang their bells.
{DUSTY BLUEBELLS}The children form a   
 ring holding hands. One child goes in 
 and out and then stops to tap someone 
 on the shoulder. They gradually make a
 chain. Everyone sings "In and out the 
 dusty bluebells...."                  
{WALLFLOWERS}Children make a ring and  
 sing "Wallflowers, wallflowers growing
 up so high".One child is then elected 
 to turn around until eventually       
 everyone has done so.
