		<content> Having gone through the usual         
 organised chaos of getting children   
 ready and taxied to school,the day was
 mine: or so I thought!I carried on to 
 do the shopping in Stokesley. The     
 fresh fruit and vegetables from the   
 market stalls were worth going for.   
 After dinner,I cut the grass in the   
 front garden, before taking some eggs 
 to a neighbour.On my return, the      
 children were coming home, hungry for 
 tea as usual.                         
   Another stretch of grass was cut    
 before I took the two older girls and 
 their friend to a Girl Guide night.   
 When I got home it was straight out   
 again as the two younger ones had a   
 Brownie party.It was 9.30pm when we   
 all got home,and I wondered if the day
 had been mine at all.
