		<title>05WOODFALLS FARM LADDINGFORD</title>
		<content> THE LAND COVER OF OUR AREA IS         
 BASICALLY GRASSLAND AND ORCHARDS.     
 ON VISITING WOODFALLS, WE DISCOVERED  
 THAT WOODFALLS FARM USED TO BE A HOP  
 FARM WITH THE HOP MARKETING BOARD - IN
 USE UNTIL ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO WHEN     
 BUSINESS WAS DISCONTINUED DUE TO THE  
 DEATH OF THE OWNER. IT WAS THEN TAKEN 
 OVER AS A PRIVATE FARM AND COMMERCIAL 
 BUSINESS.                             
 PART OF THE FARMLAND IS CULTIVATED AND
 GROWS CORN. ANOTHER PART OF THE FARM  
 IS ROUGH GRAZING FOR HORSES AND       
 BULLOCKS WHICH ARE FATTENED FOR BEEF. 
 6 HORSES ARE FED AND GROOMED DAILY AND
 CARED FOR HERE AND THEN TAKEN IN HORSE
 BOXES TO THE MEET AND USED FOR        
 HUNTING.                              
 PART OF THE RIVER MEDWAY RUNS THROUGH 
 WOODFALLS FARM.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
