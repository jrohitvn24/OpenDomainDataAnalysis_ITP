		<title>03SADBERGE VILLAGE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The{Sadberge}parish church is about   
{150}years old.It is the third church  
 to stand on this site.The first church
 built by the{Saxons}was pulled down in
{1266}and replaced by a{Norman church  
 which stood to 1832.This church was   
 given away to the builder of the      
 present church and many interesting   
 things were lost.One of the church    
{stained glass windows}was smashed by  
 some vandals.The church usually has a 
{Rector}but the congregation is now so 
 small that when the last one left in  
{1984}he was not replaced.Mr Bell the  
{churchwarden}now looks after the      
 church.He{publishes}the{church        
{magazine}once a month.After he has    
 written it my mam types it out and he 
 duplicates and disributes it.I go to  
 church every Christmas for the choir  
 practice.
