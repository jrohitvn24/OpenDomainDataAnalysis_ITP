		<title>01THE QUESTIONNAIRE</title>
		<content>{The pupils of class one of Stockland  
 School devised a questionnaire to     
 collect information to help them with 
 the Domesday Project. It was devised  
 by suggesting questions, and then they
 were discussed for their suitability; 
 for example, how long have you lived  
 in your present home ?                
 The first questionnaire was then      
 piloted on our parents. When they were
 returned a few changes were made. We  
 delivered the new questionnaire       
 personally within the D_Block, with   
 the help of parents' cars. They were  
 collected in the same way a few days  
 later.                                
 After collection we worked with the   
 raw data to collate the relevant      
 statistics which were then expressed  
 in charts and graphs.
