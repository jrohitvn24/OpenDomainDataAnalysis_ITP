		<content> There are mainly American people on   
 the base, there are both men and      
 women, and everyone has to work.      
 There is a kindergarten that the young
 children go to, then they go to a     
 lower school. On average there are    
 roughly 200 children at this school.  
 After lower school they go to high    
 school in Lakenheath. As they have no 
 half terms they have a very long      
 summer holiday and as it's an American
 school they have American holidays.   
 The unmarried people live in barracks 
 and the married live in semi-detached 
 houses or terraces.
