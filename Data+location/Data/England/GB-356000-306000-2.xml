		<content>  This is a typical day of an 11 year  
 old child who lives in the block. The 
 child we talked to lives in {Charlton 
{Hill. }She gets up at 7.30 and has a  
 breakfast of cereal and a cup of tea. 
 She has a wash and then watches TV    
 while waiting for the school minibus. 
 The journey to school is 5 miles along
 country lanes to Buildwas School. The 
 school is small with 2 classes for    
 the 40 children. During the day she   
 will do some work on Maths, English,  
 Art and a topic like snails.She may   
 also work on the school computer.She  
 has dinner at school which may consist
 of a choice between sausages and fish 
 fingers, chips and baked beans.       
 Pudding may be ice cream or apple     
 pie. School ends at 3.15 and she goes 
 home on the minibus. In the evening   
 she may watch TV or play in the garden
 with her dog.                         </content>
