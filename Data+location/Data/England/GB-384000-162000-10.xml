		<content> There is no heavy industry in this    
 rural area but some light industry has
 been established since the late 1800s.
 In Broughton on the site of what used 
 to be a sawmill a trading estate has  
 been built and some light industrial  
 workshops established, including a    
 double glazing manufacturer, a        
 commercial printing workshop and an   
 engineering workshop. Nearby in what  
 used to be a mattress manufacturers   
 premises Cannings Seals makes high    
 quality seals for the oil industry and
 the National Coal Board.              
 Holt being a small town has more      
 industry than Broughton, including a  
 tannery producing chamois leather, a  
 ventilating systems maufacturer and a 
 joinery. The recently developed       
 trading estate has light engineering, 
 specialist frozen foods and self      
 adhesive signs producers.             </content>
