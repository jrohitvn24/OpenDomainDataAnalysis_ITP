		<title>15COMPUTER NESSCLIFFE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We have got a computer in school. We  
 take it in turns with each class to   
 have the computer.  We have got a     
 VDU, discdrive and tape recorder,     
 tapes and discs. When I first had a go
 on the computer we did not have a     
 turtle chip in our BBC computer, we   
 have now.  The turtle chip lets you   
 draw things.  Last week we had 5 star 
 awards and the computer helped with   
 it. It sorts the names into order and 
 then you put your scores in.  It's    
 clever the way it sorts the scores    
 out. My favourite games area Timtrek, 
 which you are  the starship           
 Enterprise trying to kill enemy ships,
 and Frogdog, where you are this frog  
 which a dog is after.  Teashop is one 
 of the best games we have got - you   
 buy cups of tea and sell them for more
 money.                                
 Having a computer is fun.             </content>
