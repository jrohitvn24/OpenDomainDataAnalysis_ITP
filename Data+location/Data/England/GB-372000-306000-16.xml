		<content>   Two classes of upper juniors are in 
 a room which was purpose- built for   
 team teaching in the late 1960's.     
 It is two  classrooms with a dividing 
 screen across  the centre which has   
 never been closed. The third class is 
 in a room next door.                  
                                       
   The 9 to 11 year olds work together,
 and in the morning they are streamed  
 into three ability groups. In the     
 afternoon they work on environmental  
 studies in unstreamed class groups.   
                                       
    The  environmental studies for this
 age are more complex, with greater    
 depth of research, and the use of     
 secondary resources such as town      
 council and parish records.
