		<title>16A day in the life (aged 9)</title>
		<content> On Sunday mornings my mum comes into  
 my bedroom and wakes me up. I go      
 downstairs, have a drink of tea and   
 get washed and dressed. For breakfast 
 I have 'Cocopops'. After that we go to
 Sunday school. At Sunday school we    
 sing songs about God, then go into    
 classes and talk about God. After that
 we go home.                           
 When I get home I clean the rabbit    
 out. He is called Soot. When I have   
 finished I play out. We play          
 cartwheels and handstands. I play out 
 until my dinner is ready.             
 When my dinner's ready I eat it then I
 have my pudding, usually rice pudding.
 Then I play out till 6 o'clock. At 6  
 o'clock I go in for my tea. We often  
 have sausages, beans and chips. Then I
 get washed, come down for my bedtime  
 drink and then I go to bed at 8       
 o'clock.                              </content>
