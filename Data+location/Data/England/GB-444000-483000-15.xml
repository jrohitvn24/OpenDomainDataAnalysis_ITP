		<title>15VILLAGE OF FELIXKIRK</title>
		<content> Felixkirk is a small pretty village   
 nestling under the Hambleton Hills.   
 There is an unusually attractive      
 Village Hall which is used for village
 meetings, Parish Council meetings,    
 evening classes, Parochial Church     
 Council meetings and once a year the  
 Women's Institute meet there.  The    
 daily newspapers are delivered to the 
 village hall and are then collected by
 the villagers during the day.  The    
 church of St Felix is a well cared for
 building in the centre of the village.
 One bus per week operates between the 
 village and Thirsk on market day,  The
 children attend schools in Thirsk and 
 are transported daily in school buses.
 There are no shops in the village but 
 four mobile shops visit each week and 
 the mobile library calls every two    
 weeks.
