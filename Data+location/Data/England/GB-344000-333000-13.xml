		<title>13LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> We went to 3 people's homes to        
 interview them about changes that had 
 taken place over the last 30 years.   
                                       
 More houses have been built which, of 
 course, has put the population up     
 though there is a population decline  
 in the area generally.                
 One half-timbered house has been      
 demolished, trees at the end of the   
 Avenue in Lyneal have been cut down.A 
 large caravan site has developed at   
 the Yetchleys nr. Lyneal and the canal
 boat holiday industry has grown alot. 
                                       
 SCHOOL: Toilets were outside and of   
 the wooden seat and bucket variety.   
 Dinners were served in the classroom  
 where the washing up was also done.   
 Music was from a wound up gramophone.
