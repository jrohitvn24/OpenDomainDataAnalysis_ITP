 operational 35 years.On the 15th of   
 July 1985 the centre was visited by a 
 number of pupils.A number of          
 interviews were conducted including   
 nurses and doctors.                   
     One of the nurses said"I have a   
 little room where I treat the patients
 with minor complaints. If I cannot    
 treat the problem I send them to      
 Doctor Ahmed.                         
     The Doctor was interviewed while a
 patient was with him.He asked the     
 patient what was the matter and she   
 replied that the small girl with her  
 had a stomach ache.The Doctor had a   
 look at her and said she was suffering
 from growing pains.He gave her a      
 perscription.The Doctor interviewed   
 many patients and seemed to be very   
 busy.
