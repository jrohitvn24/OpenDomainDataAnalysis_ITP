		<content> tired.I said to Mummy,"There isn't    
 this many on Sundays."The church is   
 full because there were a lot of      
 people who wanted to see the new      
 vicar.The vicar is nice because he is 
 new.The vicar went to the door that   
 you come in by,then he went to the    
 bell.He rang the bell.He went to the  
 font where Timothy was christened.We  
 laughed at some jokes the bishop told 
 us.After the service we went to the   
 village hall and I had a cup of       
 orange.Mummy had a cup of tea.I had   
 some ham sandwiches and a bun with    
 white icing on it.The food was nice.I 
 saw the vicar,Mr.Trill again.Then we  
 went home.I think it was nine o'clock.
 Then I went to bed.
