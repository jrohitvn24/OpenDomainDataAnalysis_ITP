		<title>18A MARKFIELD PIG FARMER.</title>
		<content>    An interview with Factory farmer   
 Mr.Morrel,who farms at 'The Oaks'near 
 the M.1. motorway.                    
                                       
{How does the motorway affect you?     
 You learn to live with it,but when the
 wind is in the right direction then it
 is very noisy.I've fitted double      
 glazing to try and cut down the noise.
{How do you keep your pigs?            
 The pigs are kept in 70 pens,each pen 
 holding 75-100 animals.They are       
 fattened up then sold.                
{What changes have there been in       
{farming over the last 25 years?       
 The factory started almost exactly 25 
 years ago and there haven't really    
 been any changes since.               
{How many people work for you?         
 I've got 8 people who work for me and 
 the wage bill for the year comes to   
 16 000 pounds.                        </content>
