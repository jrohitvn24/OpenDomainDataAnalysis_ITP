 church of Seamer,Irton,Crossgates and 
 East Ayton.St.Martin's has an organis-
 ation called the"Porochial Church     
 Council".This council meets once a    
 month.Any person may be buried in St. 
 Martin's churchyard but Â£100 is asked 
 for annually for the upkeep of the    
 churchyard.Every second Sunday of the 
 month the vicar perform baptisms,     
 weddings and funerals.Every Sunday    
 there are two services performed, the 
 first at 8a.m.,the second at 10.45a.m.
 Some elderly people cannot manage to  
 get to these services so during the   
 week "house communions" take place and
 the vicar goes to a house and performs
 the service.The church has a "Womens  
 group" who visit the sick. The vicar  
 visits the sick,bereaved and those get
 ting married.The church has a Sunday  
 School and a fund raising committee.  </content>
