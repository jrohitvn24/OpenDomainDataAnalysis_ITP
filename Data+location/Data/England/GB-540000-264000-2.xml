		<content> Unemployment is low compared with most
 of the country with a high standard of
 living.  Almost every household has a 
 car and many have two.  Children have 
 ponies and holidays abroad are normal 
 for younger families.  About 100      
 children attend the village school to 
 the age of 11 and then travel to      
 Impington Village College.  Churches  
 and Clubs have a few faithful         
 followers but most families watch     
 television or seek entertainment      
 elsewhere.
