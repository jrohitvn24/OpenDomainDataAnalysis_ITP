		<title>17A YEAR IN LIFE OF A FIELD</title>
		<content>  I am a 17 acre field to the north of 
 Middle Rasen. My soil is well drained.
 The moisture flowing under ground and 
 appearing as spring water in the      
 village. Eventually the water joins   
 the River Rase.                       
                                       
 My crop for the past three years has  
 been wheat.                           
                                       
 In September I am ploughed and by the 
 end of October cultivated and drilled.
 My soil is sprayed pre-emergent       
 immediately after drilling. Again in  
 the spring I am sprayed with a half   
 rate of herbicide to rid me of        
 over-wintered broad leaf weeds. In    
 June I am sprayed with a three quarter
 rate of fungicide and in July half    
 rate fungicide to protect the ear of  
 the corn until harvest in August.
