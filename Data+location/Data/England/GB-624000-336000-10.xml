		<content> Norfolk is rich in flintstones,       
 commonly featured in old cottages,    
 churches, etc. Planning authorities   
 generally insist on Norfolk style new 
 building which incorporates some      
 flintwork. Some flints are "knapped"  
 or "galloted" and embedded in cement. 
 Roofs pitched steeply to accommodate  
 Norfolk Pantiles. Many old barns      
 sympathetically converted into attrac-
 tive dwellings. Estates have been     
 built to accommodate newcomers which  
 are mainly sympathetic to Norfolk     
 style.  Generally bungalows are built 
 away from traditional Norfolk housing.
 Most new building at this time takes  
 place on Beechlands Park by Mr. Roger 
 Codling.Council housing in Long Lane  
 comprises brick with generally metal  
 windows - bungalows for OAPs recently 
 built in The Square, Long Lane.
