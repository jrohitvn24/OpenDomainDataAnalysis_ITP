		<content>{The Shop}- There is only one shop in  
 the village and Mrs. Birds and Mrs.   
 Spencer serve in the shop. It is one  
 of the few brick-built buildings in   
 the village although an extension at  
 the back has been made of stone to fit
 in with the Peak National Park        
 regulations.                          
 There is a fierce dog at the back to  
 guard it. The shop sells food, sweets,
 wine, newspapers, cards, toys and     
 anything you might run out of.        
{                                      
{The Post Office}- This is in Mrs.     
 McCormick's house and she also sells  
 sweets, stationery, needles, pins and 
 threads.                              
{                                      
{Mobile shops}- Once a week George     
 Peach's butcher's van comes to the    
 village from Ashbourne. A             
 greengrocer's van comes too.          </content>
