		<content>*A new housing estate is being built   
where the old Radley College laundry   
used to be; it is going to be called   
Badgers Walk. *Norfolk cottage was     
burnt down a few weeks ago by youths.  
The roof was burnt out altogether.     
*Earlier this year a new sports centre 
was built by the college with an       
indoor swimming-pool and a large       
hall which can be used for hockey,     
basketball etc. *At Peach Croft housing
estate some new shops have been built. 
*Many adults are worried about solvent 
abuse among young teenagers, and the   
influence they have on younger         
children. Someone in the Village found 
glue sniffers on the playing field and 
reported them to the police. *Our local
policeman helped Radley boys get a     
piece of ground on which to ride their 
motorbikes, but because outsiders also 
used it he had to take it away again.  </content>
