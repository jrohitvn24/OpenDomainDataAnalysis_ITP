		<content>   Over the years the population of the
 villages has fluctuated dramatically. 
 When the original Domesday survey was 
 carried out the population of         
{Quenington}was about 100,the book only
 records 44 people, 32 men and 12      
 slaves, however by assumming that some
 of the men and slaves had a wife and  
 family a figure of a 100 is a         
 reasonable estimate. Similarly the    
 numbers in{Coln}and{Hatherop}would    
 have been approximately 50 and 25     
 respectively.                         
 After the survey the popultion of     
 the villages steadily rose then       
 suddenly plummeted in the fourteenth  
 century.This was caused by an outbreak
 of the plague.                        
 As there were insufficient farm       
 workers to till the fields many of the
 farms became sheep farms.
