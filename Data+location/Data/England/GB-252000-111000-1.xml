		<title>01MERTON AND HUISH_OUR BLOCK</title>
		<content>     Our 4Km./3Km.block includes most  
 of two very rural parishes {Merton},in
 the north and {Huish},in the south.It 
 also includes a small part of{Dolton}.
                                       
    {Merton},the principal village,lies
 astride the A 386 road midway between 
 the towns of Torrington and           
 Hatherleigh.This busy highway,one of  
 the main routes linking North Devon   
 and the city of Plymouth,runs from    
 north to south through the west of our
 block.                                
                                       
     The river Mere,from which{Merton} 
 derives its name,crosses our block    
 from south-west to north-east to join 
 the{Torridge},one of Devon's principal
 rivers.Flowing from south to north in 
 its deeply incised and thickly wooded 
 valley the{Torridge }forms a boundary 
 between{Merton}and{Dolton}in the east.</content>
