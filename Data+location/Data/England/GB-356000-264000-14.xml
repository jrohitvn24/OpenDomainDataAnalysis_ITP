		<content>{Houses. }There is only one Council    
 House in this area and no purpose     
 built accomodation for the elderly.   
 The majority of houses are owner      
 occupied with three or more bedrooms, 
 a bathroom and are fully modernised.  
{Amenities.}Mainswater is supplied to  
 most houses by Severn Trent or Welsh  
 water authorities, but a few still    
 have their own private supplies.      
 Midlands Electricity Board            
 supplies power to all homes and a few 
 are able to have Mains Gas. There is  
 no main Sewerage System so houses have
 their own Septic Tanks. Most have     
 large gardens and private drives.     
{Planning Permission}for new houses    
 is strictly regulated,mostly granted  
 for in filling or for Agriculture     
 needs. There are very few Derelict or 
 unoccupied houses as they have mostly 
 been restored.                        </content>
