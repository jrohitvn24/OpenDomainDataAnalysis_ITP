		<content> This area is south of York,east of    
 Leeds and north-west of Selby.        
 It is very flat with few single trees 
 or hedges, instead the fields are     
 bordered by drainage dykes. As a      
 result the land looks very bare in    
 winter.                               
 The R.A.F. influences life in the area
 as an employer and by the noise that  
 the planes make.                      
 The main London to York railway line  
 now runs through the west of the area 
 having been diverted away from the    
 Selby coalfield.                      
 The area contains the edge of Church  
 Fenton village but no other large     
 settlements.There are farms and       
 isolated houses scattered over the    
 block with little in the way of public
 transport or amenities.
