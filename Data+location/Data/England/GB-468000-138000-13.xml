		<content>    The health centre was built in 1974
 and gives normal medical treatment by 
 the doctors as well as chiropody,     
 dental treatment and the chance to    
 see specialist consultants. Young     
 mothers come to have their babies     
 weighed.If you have a problem the     
 nurses in the treatment room will help
 you.I have been to the treatment room 
 for a broken wrist and a Jelly Tot    
 sweet stuck up my nose.               
    I have been to Treloar Hospital for
 physiotherapy.Inside the hospital it  
 is very tidy and the nurses are very  
 kind.In one room there is a swimming  
 pool for people with bad backs and in 
 another is a man who puts rubber in   
 your shoe for comfort. There is also  
 an x_ray room as well as wards for    
 people who have to stay in hospital.
