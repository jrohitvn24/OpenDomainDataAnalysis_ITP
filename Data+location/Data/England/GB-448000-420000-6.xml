		<content> One way of spending your free time on 
 the Warwick Estate is to visit the    
 Adventure Playground.There are two    
 buildings joined in the middle and an 
 area of wooden and rope structures for
 climbing and playing on.We play at    
 tigs,hide and seek and set ourselves  
 obstacle courses to tackle on the     
 structures.The buildings house a T.V. 
 room,a pool room,a kitchen,an         
 activities room and a storeroom.      
 The Playground is run by a committee  
 and is open every weekday between 4.00
 p.m. and 8.00p.m.and between 12.00p.m.
 and 4.00p.m. at weekends.             
 Ann is in charge of the Adventure     
 Playground.When you go in you have to 
 sign your name.You have to abide by   
 the rules and if there is any         
 fighting,throwing pool balls or       
 swearing you will be banned for a     
 month.                                </content>
