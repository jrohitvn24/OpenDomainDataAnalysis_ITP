		<title>16POPULATION IN EAKRING</title>
		<content> At the last census the population of  
 the village was 401, a figure which   
 has remained static over 30 yrs with  
 Births, Deaths and movements of       
 inhabitants in and out of the village 
 keeping at the same level. Approx 25% 
 of the village is over 65 yrs, 25% is 
 under 18 yrs with 50% forming the     
 remainder. One third of the           
 inhabitants live on the Council       
 Housing Estate which has 47 houses and
 there are thought to be about 22      
 persons living alone in the village.  
 It is difficult to estimate but, only 
 half of the residents were born in the
 village or within 10 miles, the rest  
 form a moving population from all     
 parts of the country dictated by      
 employments, marriage or housing. Most
 familes have an average of 2 children.
