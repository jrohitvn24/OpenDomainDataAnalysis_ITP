		<content>{The Railway Station. }Hatfield Peverel
 Station is 108 years old. It has 2    
 platforms, a bridge over the track and
 a ticket collector to take the        
 tickets. We saw an Inter-City train   
 going to Liverpool Street Station, 36 
 miles away in London. We also saw a   
 goods train with Ford containers from 
 Belgium. It came from Felixstowe. 40  
 freight trains a day pass through the 
 station and there are 146 passenger   
 trains a day, but some do not stop.   
 550 passengers a day use the station. 
 Of 66 children in my class, 22 fathers
 commute to London each day.  The      
 fastest journey to Liverpool Street is
 43 minutes. The electric passenger    
 trains are powered by overhead lines, 
 and diesel trains also go past. There 
 are 20 lights on the station.         
 Detonators stop the trains in an      
 emergency and are placed 20 yds apart.</content>
