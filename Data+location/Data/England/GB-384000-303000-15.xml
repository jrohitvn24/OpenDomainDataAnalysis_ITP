		<title>15Organisations in Codsall</title>
		<content>The Codsall and District Civic Society 
was formed in December 1966. Its main  
aim was to stimulate the interest of   
people in Codsall,Bilbrook,Codsall Wood
and Oaken in their living environment. 
Amongst its efforts to date has been   
the setting up of what is believed to  
be the first Nature Trail confined to  
Public Footpaths;the giving of evidence
to Motorway and Structure Plan Public  
Enquiries;a major role in securing for 
the villages the sculpture "The Lone   
Singer" by the late Sir Charles Wheeler
who was the Society's first President. 
It also presents its own annual award,a
wood Sculpture by a former Codsall High
School Student, for Services to the    
Community. The Society holds monthly   
meetings throughout Autumn and Winter  
with occasional Spring/Summer outings. 
Subjects for the former range from     
Wildlife to History. All ages may join.</content>
