		<title>18The Chantries, Shalford Mill</title>
		<content>{Shalford Mill}was built around 1700.  
 It is made of oak and chestnut and the
 roof tiles are hand made. Originally  
 it was used to grind wheat, barley,   
 oats and rye. It has not been used    
 since 1918. In 1932 part of the mill  
 was converted into a house which      
 initially was used as a weekend       
 residence by the family who owned it. 
 During World War II evacuees were     
 housed here. Since 1952 it has been a 
 permanent residence. The mill is now  
 owned by the National Trust.          
                                       
{The Chantries}area is found on the    
 North Downs, south of Guildford.      
 In the Middle Ages a rich man, Mr.    
 Norbridge sold the land he owned to a 
 priest, on condition that he built a  
 chantry chapel on it. This is where   
 the community of the chapel sang daily
 masses for the souls of the founders. </content>
