		<content> The first shop on the green at the    
 southern end is the village Post      
 Office Stores. It was once a Bakery   
 prior to becoming a general store with
 a Post Office counter - part of the   
 Londis chain. In the old bakery bread 
 was baked until about thirty years    
 ago. The building is of brick with    
 pebble dash and a slate roof. Modern  
 services now replace gaslight, pump   
 water,and a cess-pit on the quarter   
 acre site. Since the days of the      
 bakery there have been four owners,   
 the present ones,Mr and Mrs Stevens,  
 being the parents of the village      
 newsagent and confectioner. The store 
 sells most foodstuffs including fresh 
 bread and meat delivered daily.       
 Close to the P.O.Stores is the        
 old butchers shop, now a private      
 house, and between the two is the     
 original butcher's slaughterhouse.    </content>
