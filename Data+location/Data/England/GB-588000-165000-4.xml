		<content> A survey amongst young people and     
 their parents when asked for their    
 main worries resulted in the following
 four major concerns:                  
 a). Money - Would the family be able  
     to meet all the bills and continue
     to feed and clothe itself.        
 b). Employment - Would the parents    
     retain their jobs and will there  
     be work for their children when   
     they leave school.                
 c). Drugs - With evidence of glue     
     sniffing to be found in Kemsley,  
     and daily national news of wider  
     and harder abuses, parents are    
     concerned as to how they can      
     prevent their own childrens       
     involvement.                      
 d). Vandalism - General concern over  
     the apparent need for youngsters  
     to smash things and create        
     graffitti with paint spray cans.  </content>
