		<title>06LOCAL HISTORY OF LINKENHOLT</title>
		<content> Linkenholt was mentioned in Domesday  
 spelt Linchelow meaning Wood on the   
 Hill; the church was not mentioned    
 until 1533. The population in 1861 was
 88, in 1985 it is 50 - 40 adults and  
 10 children.                          
 A memorial in the church is to the    
 Festing family long connected with the
 Parish as a Festing married into the  
 Worgan family from the Manor.         
 There are memorials to those killed in
 the 1914-18 War (one name) and in the 
 1939-45 War (two names).              
 The old graveyard is now under the    
 Manor garden as the church was moved  
 in 1871 and the Festing family vault  
 is probably there too.
