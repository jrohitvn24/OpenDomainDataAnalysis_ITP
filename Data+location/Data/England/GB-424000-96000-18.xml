		<content> In 1977 a few Bashley families        
 organised a Silver Jubilee Party.It   
 was so successful they have continued 
 to organise local events including an 
 annual Horse Show. The group are known
 as the Bashley '6'. This year's show  
 includes jumping, showing (in hand and
 ridden), Private Driving, Veteran and 
 Gymkhana. Â£8000 has been raised by the
 group towards a new village hall.     
 Although Bashley is a small, scattered
 village it has a busy social calendar,
 including a disabled club, 2 W.I.     
 groups, bridge, cricket and football  
 clubs. Bashley Village Hall Committee 
 organise a number of functions        
 including a harvest supper and a      
 carnival which lasts throughout July. 
 Carnival events include a family      
 barbecue, a walking treasure hunt, a  
 parade with floats followed by a dance
 and a flower show and fete.           </content>
