		<content>   The main animals around here are    
 dairy,beef cattle and horses.There is 
 a fair amount of permanent pasture for
 grazing and also providing hay for    
 winter feed.These pastures are usually
 situated near rivers and streams.They 
 are not suitable for arable crop,being
 too wet for cultivations.The labour   
 force on farms has decreased over the 
 years because of a greater use of     
 machinery and an increase in farm     
 wages.The only time extra labour is   
 used is in the summer and autumn for  
 harvest work and potatoe              
 picking.Machinery is continually being
 designed to give greater output and   
 increased efficiency.The aim of the   
 farmer is to produce high yiuelds at  
 low costs.
