		<title>17MALBOROUGH'S ROADS</title>
		<content> Roads in this area are very winding,  
 even the main roads. The{Lower Town   
 road is quite rough because some      
 chippings are loose. The main roads   
 are quite smooth because of all the   
 traffic that has worn them down.      
 We went to{Mace}shop and we did a     
 survey to see what people thought     
 about the roads.We asked twenty people
 if they thought that they preferred   
 country lanes to main roads and if    
 they thought that there should be more
 roads in this area. Thirteen people   
 preferred country lanes to main roads.
 Only four people liked main roads     
 better than country lanes. Nobody     
 wanted any more roads in this area.   
 Somebody wanted a oneway system in    
{Malborough. Mrs  Cole }wanted less    
 traffic so that you could get around  
 more easily.
