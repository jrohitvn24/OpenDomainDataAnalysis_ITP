		<title>08HOUSING ESTATE AT HORSHAM</title>
		<content>   In{Hills Farm,}a newly developed    
 housing estate on the northern        
 outskirts of Horsham there is a great 
 lack of{amenities.}There are no       
 shops,not even a telephone box or post
 box,in the whole estate.There are     
 shops in the local village,Broadbridge
 Heath, which is about 1 mile away and 
 also the town of{Horsham,}which is    
 about the same distance away. The only
 amenity seems to be a tiny children's 
 playground which consists of{2 swings,
{1 slide and 1 roundabout.             
   There are{plans}to build an American
 football pitch on one of the nearby   
 grassland areas.This would be part of 
 a scheme to produce amenities for the 
 new estate.These are only plans and   
 ideas for the new estate and the whole
 thing may be abandoned for lack of    
 finance.
