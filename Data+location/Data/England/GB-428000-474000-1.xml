		<title>01  GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> This area consists almost entirely of 
 farm land.A closer look, however,     
 reveals many interesting features.    
   The main road from Ripon to North   
 Stainley the A6108 is the only road in
 the area.                             
   Parallel to it, to the east runs the
 River Ure, which provides the parish  
 boundary.Between the river and the    
 road are several farms and a nature   
 reserve.                              
   East of the river and in the top    
 right-hand corner of the grid lies    
{Norton Conyers,}a large old house now 
 open to the public.                   
   On the other side of the grid, west 
 of the road is{Lightwater Valley Farm.
 This is more than just a farm; it is  
 also an amusement park which is very  
 popular in the Summer.
