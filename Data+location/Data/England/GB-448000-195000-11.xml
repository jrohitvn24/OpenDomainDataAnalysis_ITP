		<title>11MY DAY IN ABINGDON</title>
		<content>In the morning when I wake up there is 
Kevin,Stuart and Neale, my brothers,   
and Mum in our house.Dad has already   
gone to work at Harwell where he is a  
pipe fitter.I have my breakfast with   
Kevin and Stuart.Neale, who is only    
eleven months old,is still in bed.We   
usually have cerael and a cup of tea,I 
then go to school with Kevin.          
  After school I go home and Mum,      
Stuart and Neale are there,then I go   
out to play with my friends.I come     
back at 5.00pm and have my             
tea.Afterwards my Mum goes to work     
.She works as a cleaner at Culham,from 
6.00pm until 8.30pm.When my Mum comes  
home from work we go upstairs to       
play,we go to bed at 9.00pm.           
  On Saturdays we go around to our     
Nan's house.On most Sundays we go to   
the garden centre at Tesco's store.
