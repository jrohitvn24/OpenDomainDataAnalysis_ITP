		<title>11Flitton Parish Church</title>
		<content> The church stands on a rise in the    
 centre of the original village and was
 built about 500 years ago. It was     
 constructed of local sandstone and,   
 unlike many village churches, was not 
 extended piecemeal.                   
                                       
 The one main addition was the Grey    
 family chapel, built for the tombs of 
 the owners of Wrest Park in nearby    
 Silsoe. The chapel contains a number  
 of monuments, the earliest dating from
 the 16th Century.                     
                                       
 The medieval screen, glass and pulpit 
 have been removed but there is still  
 much that is interesting.             
                                       
 The dedication is to St.John the      
 Baptist.
