		<content> Times of Change by Mrs.Ruby Carne.    
                                       
 I grew up in Northchapel long,long ago
 When times were hard and life was slow
 The hungry twenties &amp; thirties we knew
 With money scarce and jobs so few.    
                                       
 But all our neighbours we knew by name
 None were better off,all were the same
 Husbands went for miles jobs to find, 
 And took what was offered,of any kind.
                                       
 Now we have come some fifty years on  
 Those early hardships certainly gone. 
 We're now in the 80's,progressed afar 
 But I can't see how much better we are
                                       
 Now having reached three score and ten
 I see such difference tween now &amp; then
 With living standards improved a lot  
 But is anyone happier,I think not.
