 All the children have travelled on a  
 bus, mainly to the nearby towns of    
 Epsom and Kingston.  Most have been on
 a main line train, either to London, a
 journey of about 15 miles, or on      
 holiday trips or outings to the South 
 Coast, Brighton, Bognor or            
 Littlehampton.  Many children have    
 also travelled on the London          
 Transport underground trains.  Very   
 few children have travelled on an     
 aeroplane, and the ones who have all  
 went abroad on holiday, mostly to     
 Europe, one or two to North America,  
 Africa and the Far East.  The small   
 number of children who have           
 experienced travel by ship went to the
 Isle of Wight and to France.
