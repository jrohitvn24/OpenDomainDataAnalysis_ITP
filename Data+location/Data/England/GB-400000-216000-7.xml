		<content>    By all accounts St. Oswalds Church 
 has not always been so well cared for 
 as it is today. In 1569 it was        
 reported to the Gloucester Diocesan   
 Consistary Court that the church      
 possessed no surplice, that the Rector
 did not attend to his duties, and that
 the church was ruinous. Again there   
 was cause to complain three years     
 later, when the windows of both the   
 nave and the chancel were unglazed,   
 the mounds of the graves in the       
 churchyard were in disrepair, there   
 was no Parish Clerk and the Parson had
 lost the key, so the church door could
 not be locked. In 1902 the church was 
 again restored, when  the old gallery 
 and the old box pews were replaced by 
 new oak seats, the old pews being used
 for panelling.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
