		<content>  St.James' Church has a fine tower    
 which is eighty feet high and dates   
 from the 15th  century.It still bears 
 the marks of shot holes which it      
 received in 1643,when General Sir     
 Willam Waller attempted to take the   
 Castle and Town.                      
 The Church was rebuilt in 1832 in     
 perpendicular style and stands by the 
 great pond on the green called The    
 Crammer.                              
 The congregation generally numbers    
 about 350 people and there are on     
 average 30 Christenings and 25 to     
 50 weddings a year.The Church is      
 closly associated with Southbroom     
 Junior School and services are held   
 involving the pupils at Christmas and 
 Easter.                               
 The Vicar of St James' often takes    
 morning assembly at the school.
