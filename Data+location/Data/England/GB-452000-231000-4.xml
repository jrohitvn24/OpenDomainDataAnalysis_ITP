		<content> The Methodist Chapel in the High      
 Street closed in the spring after the 
 death of its staunchest supporter.    
 There had been a very small attendance
 at the occasional afternoon service,  
 conducted by a visiting Minister.  As 
 we write, the Chapel has been leased  
 to a group of Pentecostals from the US
 Community.  They are preparing to     
 begin worship in Dec 86.              
                                       
 Links between the various churches on 
 the Base and the Anglican Parish are  
 strong.  Our evening Organist also    
 plays in the mornings for the         
 Protestant Chapel on the base, and    
 their choir sometimes sings in All    
 Saints'.  This summer the Protestant  
 Chapels at Upper Heyford and Croughton
 gave their offering for July 21st as a
 gift to our Restoration Fund - a total
 of Â£764.76                            </content>
