 dairy. A cowshed used to stand where  
 the{garage}is now. There are two main 
 buildings the old "Barge Cottage"and  
 the workshop where Mr. Wakelin and    
 Mr. Metchear work. There are two pumps
 and the current{price of petrol}is    
 Â£2.04. The garage does M.O.T. tests,  
 services  and general maintenance .   
 The service station, besides doing    
 genral maintenance on vehicles, sells
