		<title>10THE SCHOOL SITE.</title>
		<content> A map of the Copthorne area of        
 Shrewsbury dated 1882 shows a claypit 
 on what is now the site of St Georges 
 County Junior School Woodfield Road. A
 field called Brickfield was very near 
 the claypit and a brick kiln is also  
 shown. There is also evidence of a    
 tramway connecting with the site. A   
 later map dated 1938 of the same area 
 shows Woodfield Road and Woodfield    
 Avenue. Near our school there was a   
 Roman roadway which was incorporated  
 into the Shrewsbury By-Pass. We have  
 been told that our present school     
 playing field was previously a rubbish
 tip, which in turn was built over the 
 old playpit.
