		<title>13Tolworth Recreation Centre</title>
		<content> This recreation centre stands next to 
 my school ( Tolworth Girls School).   
 This is a modern building . It        
 provides us with most of our sports   
 facilities. It has a basketball       
 arena,gym, theatre, buffet and squash 
 courts. Our School also often uses the
 centre for our assemblies, and we also
 use it for drama. The public are using
 the facilities all the time, although 
 most come in the evening after work.  
 Employees of Kingston Borough are     
 allowed free membership. Some of the  
 best basketball teams in the world    
 play here, as Kingston play here and  
 they are one of the leading teams in  
 this country. Discos are held here and
 the centre is also very popular for   
 its sauna facilities. The centre does 
 not have a swimming pool, the nearest 
 pool is the "Kingfisher" in Kingston.
