		<title>17HOBBIES OF DARREN AND GEMMA</title>
		<content>  Darren's hobby is moto-cross.This is 
 a very dangerous sport which takes a  
 lot of courage because it means riding
 a motor bike over rough ground and    
 jumping off vertical drops as high as 
 a man.So far he has been lucky because
 he hasn't broken any bones,but his    
 brother used to scramble and he broke 
 his collar bone.                      
  Gemma's hobby is collecting old      
 bottles from the past.So far she has  
 collected quite a few.One of them is  
 an old lemonade bottle,and another is 
 a milk bottle dated 1948,the same year
 as her mother was born.She said that  
 she used to use them when she was a   
 little girl.Gemma attends Robinsons   
 End Middle School,and most of the     
 bottles she has collected have come   
 from just over the road from the      
 school.
