       Warnborough College was founded 
in 1973 as an independent British      
University College. It is a recognised 
examination centre for British and     
American examining bodies. "Warnborough
offers a new kind of educational bridge
into self awareness, self assurance and
a deeper understanding of the world - a
passport indeed into the international 
community"- College brochure.          
                                       
       The college was the palace of   
the Bishop of Oxford from 1937 to 1953 
and then became known as Plater        
College. Warnborough acquired the      
campus in 1976 and in 1978 added the   
adjoining property known then as       
Yatscombe.
