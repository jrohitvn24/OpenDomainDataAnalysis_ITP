		<title>01Introduction to Grundisburgh</title>
		<content>Grundisburgh is a village approximat-  
ely 5 kms from town of Woodbridge,10   
kms from Ipswich. The main street of   
the village follows the valley line of 
the R.Finn as it descends a gentle     
hill. Connurbations occur at the top   
and the bottom of this hill, though    
there is ribbon  development along its 
length. Land not used for housing is   
mostly used for agricultural purposes; 
arable and stock. There is also some   
woodland maintained largely for game.  
The rural environment is without manu- 
facturing industry, retaining peace    
and unspoilt charm, though influenced  
by centres of industry nearby; many of 
the population working outwith the     
village. A "Key" village in the Suffolk
Plan,further expansion may take place  
providing housing though little employ-
ment.There's an expressed concern that 
new housing be provided with sympathy. </content>
