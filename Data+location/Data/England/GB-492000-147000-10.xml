		<title>10MONKGROVE COPSE PUTTENHAM</title>
		<content> Eighteen hectares of ancient woodland 
 called{Monkgrove Copse}have been      
 bought by{Puttenham Golf Club}to      
 extend the course. The Club say that  
 Puttenham course is shorter than the  
 average and also that the re_arranged 
 holes would make it safer for both    
 players and walkers on the Heath.     
                                       
 Some local people want to save the    
 trees, flowers and wild life from     
 being destroyed. They say the Nature  
 Conservancy Council have listed the   
 copse as a site of special scientific 
 interest and want to save it for the  
 badgers, foxes, deer, squirrels, birds
 and insects etc. They also say half of
 the woodland in Surrey has been lost  
 in the last thirty years.             
 The local Council is expected to      
 decide what will happen to the copse  
 later in 1985.                        </content>
