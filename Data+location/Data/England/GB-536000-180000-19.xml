		<content>A normal day begins for me at 7.30 when
I wake up.I bath,dress and eat;I leave 
for school at 8.30.It takes 5 minutes  
by bicycle as I live very near to the  
school.I go straight to my classroom to
prepare for the day,water the plants   
and feed the 2 white mice,Snowy and    
Bitsy.The children come in at 9.00 and 
we go through the register,dinner money
etc before settling down to work.This  
year I have 2nd year juniors and they  
have been a real pleasure to be with.We
have worked from a topic base starting 
with the playground and working outward
to the school ,local streets etc and   
finishing up with the Domesday Project.
In our class we have a good cultural   
mix-Asian,Turkish,Afro-Caribbean,Arabic
Irish and English.I usually stay behind
to mount displays,mark work and prepare
things until 5.30.
