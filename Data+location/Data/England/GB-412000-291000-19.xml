		<title>19CRIME IN CASTLE VALE</title>
		<content> CASTLE VALE RARELY HAS LARGE CRIMES,  
BUT IT IS AN AREA WHERE THERE ARE MANY 
PETTY CRIMES COMMITTED.THE MOST COMMON 
CRIME IS CAR STEALING.CARS ARE TAKEN   
FROM THE ESTATE AND NEARBY AREAS,      
USUALLY BY YOUNG ADULTS FOR JOY RIDING.
THE CAR IS OFTEN SMASHED BEFORE IT IS  
ABANDONED IN THE STREETS.ANOTHER COMMON
CRIME ON THE ESTATE IS VANDALISM.THE   
SCHOOLS AND LIBRARY OFTEN HAVE SMASHED 
WINDOWS;IT IS SO BAD THAT PLASTIC      
WINDOWS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN THESE   
BUILDINGS AND IN ALL THE BUS STOPS.    
GRAFFITTI IS PAINTED ON THE SIDES OF   
BUILDINGS ALL AROUND THE ESTATE.       
HOUSE BREAKING IS ANOTHER COMMON       
CRIME.THE THIEVES USUALLY STEAL T.V.   
SETS AND VIDEOS.UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS 
NO POLICE STATION,ONLY A POLICE UNIT   
ON THE ESTATE,SO THERE ARE NO REGULAR  
POLICE PATROLS.                        
                                       </content>
