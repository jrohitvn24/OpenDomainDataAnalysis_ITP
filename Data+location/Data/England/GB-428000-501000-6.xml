		<content> Pre-school education is available in  
 both villages. North Cowton has a     
 nursery twice a week. 15 years ago it 
 drew children from a 5 mile radius but
 now other villages have started their 
 own groups, now North Cowton has only 
 10 children. East Cowton playgroup    
 started 5 years ago and has 18        
 members. Both villages have Primary   
 Schools. North &amp; South Cowton School  
 is housed in 2 buildings, with a      
 separate canteen, meals are now       
 brought from East Cowton. The school  
 population is declining - 32 in Autumn
 1985. There are 2 full time teachers. 
 Children generally move to Richmond   
 schools at the age of 11.             
 The present East Cowton school was    
 built in 1978, has a population of 68,
 and 3 full time teachers. At 11,      
 children move on to the Northallerton 
 secondary schools.                    </content>
