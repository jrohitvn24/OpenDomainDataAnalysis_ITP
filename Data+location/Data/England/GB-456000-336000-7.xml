		<content>    In{Wilford}most of the{houses}are  
 detached. They are made of brick and  
 have a tiled roof. Most of them have  
 central heating. In Wilford we have a 
 lot of land space and some of it is   
 being built on.                       
    Some of the houses are quite old,  
 especially those near the church. Some
 of them back on to the{River Trent.   
    We did a{traffic}count of vehicles 
 passing through Wilford. In half an   
 hour, there were 91 cars, 30 vans, 22 
 lorries, 5 bicycles, 15 motor bikes   
 and 8 buses.                          
    I think there were more cars       
 because people go to work in cars     
 every day. Not many people work in    
 Wilford but many pass through it in   
 order to get to work.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
