		<content>   The main villages  in this area of  
 rural Hertfordshire are{Great         
{Gaddesden &amp; Nettleden.} In these      
 villages the main industry is         
 FARMING  due to the large amount      
 of open land in this area.            
 However, a large amount of the        
 inhabitants in this area are also     
 COMMUTERS.  On the outskirts of       
 Nettleden there is a large amount of  
 land which is{NATIONAL TRUST}property 
 which is being used to conserve the   
 country's heritage.                   
  In these villages there is often a   
 lack of AMENITIES but generally most  
 villages have a village shop or a     
 post-office. Great Gaddesden is well  
 equipped with a school, nursery,      
 Church, Buddhist monastery, football  
 pitch and riding school.
