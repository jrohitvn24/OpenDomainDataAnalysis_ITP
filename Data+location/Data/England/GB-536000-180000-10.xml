		<title>10Where I Live</title>
		<content>I live in 34,Serle House.It is a very  
old building.Downstairs there is a     
porch.There are two pubs beside the    
building.In the porch there are        
concrete posts.Around the building     
there lots of flats.I live in a part   
of London called Tower Hamlets.        
In Tower Hamlets there are lots of     
different kinds of housing.There are   
tower blocks,maisonettes,terraced,     
semi-detached and detached houses.     
There are also lots of pubs and shops. 
Some are new and some are old.My       
building is in the Ocean Estate,which  
was built just over 30 years ago.The   
condition of the buildings in my area  
is poor and mucky,they need lots of    
work to be done on them.
