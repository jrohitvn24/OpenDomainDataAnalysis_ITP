		<content>   Stuart and I are both{pet lovers.}I 
 have got two{cats.}I did have four but
 Scratch died when it was run over by a
 car and Flopper died of old age. We   
 both have a{dog.}Mine is a golden     
 labrador called Pippa and Stuart has a
 mongrel called Dusty. Cats are more   
 independent than dogs and only need   
 feeding, but dogs are more fun to play
 with and take for walks.              
   Stuart has two{goldfish.}I did have 
 seven but they died from overfeeding! 
 Stuart also has two{rabbits,}Buffy and
 Sooty,who have had fifteen babies!The 
 worst part about cleaning out rabbit  
 hutches is the awful pong!            
   We don't have any other pets        
 ourselves but some of our friends have
{gerbils}and caged{birds}like          
 budgerigars and we have a tank of     
{tropical fish}at school.
