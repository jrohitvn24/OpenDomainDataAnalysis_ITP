		<title>13The Motorway (M6)</title>
		<content> The motorway is one of the main       
{transport}links in the area. Many     
 different types of traffic use it,    
 such as: cars, lorries, vans,         
 motorbikes and caravans. There are    
 three lanes on either side. The first 
 southbound junction is to Lancaster,  
 Morecambe and Kirkby Lonsdale. The    
 first northbound junction is to       
 Carnforth. When the motorway was      
 built, they used the gravel from local
 quarries. People who have a long way  
 to travel use the motorway. It does   
 not bring problems to our everyday    
 lives. From the school you can hear   
 the traffic. There is a continuous    
 buzzing all the time, but it does not 
 bother us, even though our school is  
 only two fields away from the         
 motorway.
