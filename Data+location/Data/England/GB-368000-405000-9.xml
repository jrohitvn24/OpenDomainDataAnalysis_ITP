		<content>     Most churches in our area have to 
 be kept locked during the day because 
 of possible vandalism or theft. They  
 don't seem to be as well supported    
 financially, or as well attended, as  
 they used to be in the past.          
     Some churches have changed their  
 original denomination, like the{Church
{of the Good Shepherd}in High Street.  
 This is now a Polish Church but       
 started off as{All Saints R.C. Church.
     The church at the bottom of       
 Rishton Lane used to be known as{     
{Victoria Methodist}and it had a junior
 school attached. It is now a mosque   
 for the Muslim population and is known
 as {Medina Mosque.}The children come  
 from quite a wide area every night to 
 learn about the Koran.                
                                       
                       Shelly Mather.
