		<title>15BUNNING AND SONS</title>
		<content>  Bunning and Sons operates on the site
 of the village forge in Gressenhall   
 where our parents used to watch horses
 being shod. It was founded in1906 by  
 Robert Bunning, grandfather of the 3  
 brothers who currently run the firm . 
 The shoeing side of the business was  
 sold in 1969, and the business        
 expanded into agricultural engineering
 doing various repairs.                
 Now with a work force of 20 the firm  
 manufactures trailers which are sold  
 throughout East Anglia, Kent and      
 Sussex. Our fathers, Robin and John   
 are two of the brothers and David is  
 the other one. Our grandfather George 
 Bunning lost an eye when a spark flew 
 into it when he was shoeing a horse.  
 Our cousin James also goes to         
 St.Mary's C.P.School.
