		<title>10The 'Old Days' in Grangetown</title>
		<content>    Mr. Tough, an eighty one year old  
 Grangetown inhabitant, told us that   
 when he was a boy{Grangetown}had six  
{farms}and most of the farms kept cows.
 The milk cart came round Grangetown   
 twice a day with fresh milk from      
 the{farms}and you could buy as little 
 as a quarter of a pint. He said many  
 people kept hens in their back yards  
 and they let them roam the streets.   
    Mr.Tough's father had come from    
 Four Stones near{Hexham,}over a       
 hundred years ago,to work as a paper  
 maker at the{Paper Mill}in{Sunderland 
 and many families had come with him.  
    He said he now spends most of his  
 time working on an allotment and he   
 goes bowling and dancing. He goes to  
 St. Aidan's Church and has been in the
 choir there 70 years. He told us lots 
 of other stories about the{'Old Days' 
 in{Grangetown.                        </content>
