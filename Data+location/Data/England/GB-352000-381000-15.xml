		<content>{4.Reclaimed land.Wigg Island.}        
 Formerly a heavily industrialised     
 area,producing alkali,                
 chlorines,copper,sulpher and mustard  
 gas (1863_1945).The whole area has now
 been reclaimed and is owned by Halton 
 Borough Council.The old plant and     
 works have been demolished and the    
 land has been capped with concrete    
 which has then been covered with      
 imported top soil.The site is         
 currently undergoing landscaping for  
 use as a public recreation area.      
{Plant distribution:}On the meadow     
 lands we found 5 species of grass and 
 15 different kinds of herbs.On the    
 newly planted areas were 6 native     
 trees and various species of shrub.The
 undergrowth has been controlled by    
 spraying.The estuary and salt marsh   
 were not accessible to the public.    
 Little evidence yet of animal life.   </content>
